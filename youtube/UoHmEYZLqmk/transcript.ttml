<p begin="00:00:00.260" end="00:00:05.790" style="s2">one way of framing it is that we are</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.300" end="00:00:10.200" style="s2">smack dab in the middle of a global</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.790" end="00:00:11.370" style="s2">scale civilization level collapse now if</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.200" end="00:00:13.799" style="s2">we do our job right it will be a</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.370" end="00:00:16.260" style="s2">transition to something else but right</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.799" end="00:00:18.539" style="s2">now we&#39;re collapse is a good way of</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.260" end="00:00:20.520" style="s2">thinking about what&#39;s happening and what</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.539" end="00:00:21.900" style="s2">I mean by global scale is that for the</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.520" end="00:00:23.550" style="s2">very first time in human history</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.900" end="00:00:27.449" style="s2">starting somewhere or maybe in the 80s</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.550" end="00:00:29.130" style="s2">all of human beings were roughly and</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.449" end="00:00:33.410" style="s2">trained in a single civilization</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.130" end="00:00:33.410" style="s2">framework that&#39;s never happen before</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.140" end="00:00:41.160" style="s2">so so to begin what I would like to do</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.239" end="00:00:46.309" style="s2">is I would like to express my personal</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.160" end="00:00:46.309" style="s2">thanks to president Donald James Trump</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.550" end="00:00:53.699" style="s2">no I&#39;m serious</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.109" end="00:00:55.440" style="s2">because the 2016 election did more to</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.699" end="00:00:58.369" style="s2">shake good people from the dogmatic</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.440" end="00:01:01.379" style="s2">slumbers than any event that I&#39;m aware</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.369" end="00:01:03.269" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a it&#39;s actually been a very</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.379" end="00:01:05.189" style="s2">big deal I&#39;ve salts a significant</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.269" end="00:01:08.369" style="s2">increase in energy is it giving an</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.189" end="00:01:10.590" style="s2">increase in a willingness to accept the</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.369" end="00:01:13.319" style="s2">fact that the best way to describe our</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.590" end="00:01:16.409" style="s2">current circumstances is that should</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.319" end="00:01:18.140" style="s2">have up it&#39;s actually a deep</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.409" end="00:01:19.649" style="s2">insight because it recognizes</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.140" end="00:01:21.899" style="s2">simultaneously that things aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.649" end="00:01:24.170" style="s2">working and we haven&#39;t got a good way of</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.899" end="00:01:26.250" style="s2">describing exactly what is going wrong</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.170" end="00:01:28.080" style="s2">and that&#39;s like the first temperature</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.250" end="00:01:30.780" style="s2">real wisdom so it&#39;s a good thing that</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.080" end="00:01:32.009" style="s2">that&#39;s happening we&#39;re going to spend a</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.780" end="00:01:34.560" style="s2">little bit of time trying to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.009" end="00:01:36.990" style="s2">what we&#39;ve been doing and trying to put</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.560" end="00:01:39.869" style="s2">some frameworks around what should have</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.990" end="00:01:44.099" style="s2">sucked up might mean and how we might go</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.869" end="00:01:48.000" style="s2">about visioning what a good positive</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.099" end="00:01:50.160" style="s2">direction might look like and I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.000" end="00:01:51.989" style="s2">to start I think we just a short piece</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.160" end="00:01:54.479" style="s2">and then Daniel will go into some depth</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.989" end="00:01:57.479" style="s2">on the nature of the problem and in</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.479" end="00:02:01.459" style="s2">forest will actually introduce us to an</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.479" end="00:02:04.530" style="s2">example of what a piece of the solution</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.459" end="00:02:09.479" style="s2">likely looks like in something that he</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.530" end="00:02:12.120" style="s2">calls transcendental design so one way</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.479" end="00:02:14.540" style="s2">of framing it is that we are smack dab</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.120" end="00:02:18.450" style="s2">in the middle of a global scale</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.540" end="00:02:20.190" style="s2">civilization level collapse now if we do</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.450" end="00:02:22.819" style="s2">our job right it will be a transition to</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.190" end="00:02:24.750" style="s2">something else but right now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.819" end="00:02:26.909" style="s2">collapse is a good way of thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.750" end="00:02:29.159" style="s2">what&#39;s happening and what I mean by</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.909" end="00:02:30.989" style="s2">global scale is that for the very first</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.159" end="00:02:34.200" style="s2">time in human history starting somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.989" end="00:02:36.780" style="s2">maybe in the 80s all human beings were</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.200" end="00:02:38.790" style="s2">roughly and trained in a single</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.780" end="00:02:42.269" style="s2">civilization framework that&#39;s never</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.790" end="00:02:44.280" style="s2">happened before and then now that</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.269" end="00:02:46.139" style="s2">civilization framework is reaching its</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.280" end="00:02:48.749" style="s2">end of life and what I mean by</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.139" end="00:02:49.379" style="s2">civilization is roughly the things like</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.749" end="00:02:51.629" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.379" end="00:02:54.719" style="s2">the axioms the assumptions the</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.629" end="00:02:57.750" style="s2">heuristics the models the practices the</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.719" end="00:03:01.530" style="s2">institutions that we humans use to solve</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.750" end="00:03:04.530" style="s2">problems and to make our meet our needs</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.530" end="00:03:07.859" style="s2">so whether this means things like go to</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.530" end="00:03:10.470" style="s2">college or get a job at a company and</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.859" end="00:03:11.790" style="s2">get paid money to buy food or go to a</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.470" end="00:03:13.109" style="s2">grocery store to get food right these</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.790" end="00:03:15.060" style="s2">are all the things that our civilization</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.109" end="00:03:20.340" style="s2">produces to allow us to solve problems</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.060" end="00:03:22.290" style="s2">and get our needs met and an insight and</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.340" end="00:03:24.420" style="s2">I think a core thing for more and more</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.290" end="00:03:27.419" style="s2">people to really grasp is that our</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.420" end="00:03:29.250" style="s2">civilization toolkit this thing that has</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.419" end="00:03:31.109" style="s2">gotten is so far this thing that has</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.250" end="00:03:33.180" style="s2">produced seven and a half billion people</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.109" end="00:03:34.439" style="s2">in a level of capacity and wealth and</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.180" end="00:03:37.919" style="s2">well-being that&#39;s never been seen before</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.439" end="00:03:40.620" style="s2">is itself the thing that is reached its</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.919" end="00:03:43.019" style="s2">end it just can&#39;t solve the problems</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.620" end="00:03:44.609" style="s2">that we&#39;re facing and by the way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.019" end="00:03:46.459" style="s2">also falling apart under its own terms</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.609" end="00:03:48.959" style="s2">but that&#39;s a different conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.459" end="00:03:52.099" style="s2">so what we have to do is we have to</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.959" end="00:03:54.870" style="s2">figure out first how to unload that</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.099" end="00:03:56.669" style="s2">toolkit unload our assumptions unload</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.870" end="00:03:58.319" style="s2">the things that have worked so well and</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.669" end="00:04:00.989" style="s2">get all the way down to the deep code</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.319" end="00:04:02.940" style="s2">and rebuild something kind of from</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.989" end="00:04:05.370" style="s2">scratch and we&#39;re going to have to do</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.940" end="00:04:06.359" style="s2">this very rapidly so this involves</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.370" end="00:04:08.760" style="s2">something that we&#39;ve never done before</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.359" end="00:04:11.069" style="s2">as the people it&#39;s going to require a</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.760" end="00:04:13.260" style="s2">level of vision it&#39;s going to require a</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.069" end="00:04:17.609" style="s2">level of communion it&#39;s going to require</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.260" end="00:04:19.500" style="s2">a level of peace that is I mean largely</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.609" end="00:04:21.449" style="s2">is considered to be fiction or prophecy</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.500" end="00:04:25.349" style="s2">and now it&#39;s not now it is in fact</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.449" end="00:04:26.849" style="s2">minimum necessary requirements which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.349" end="00:04:29.250" style="s2">kind of an interesting thing you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.849" end="00:04:31.139" style="s2">sometimes I find myself sitting Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.250" end="00:04:31.979" style="s2">and I work together in a business and</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.139" end="00:04:34.050" style="s2">sitting in the room having a</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.979" end="00:04:36.030" style="s2">conversation about business E things and</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.050" end="00:04:37.229" style="s2">I&#39;ll just reflect and say gosh last</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.030" end="00:04:39.389" style="s2">night as having conversations with</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.229" end="00:04:41.010" style="s2">people that it&#39;s quite like within the</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.389" end="00:04:43.919" style="s2">next seven years our oceans will just be</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.010" end="00:04:45.650" style="s2">dead and that&#39;s the clock and these are</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.919" end="00:04:49.320" style="s2">the things that we&#39;re dealing with and</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.650" end="00:04:50.699" style="s2">we were talking outside the Daniel wants</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.320" end="00:04:53.460" style="s2">to make sure that as we&#39;re communicating</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.699" end="00:04:55.919" style="s2">that people are left here with the sense</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.460" end="00:04:58.950" style="s2">of empowerment and not a sense of panic</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.919" end="00:05:02.580" style="s2">or fear and what I&#39;d like to convey is a</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.950" end="00:05:03.180" style="s2">sense of resolve which is recognize that</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.580" end="00:05:05.790" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.180" end="00:05:07.410" style="s2">in fact actually step in and that fear</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.790" end="00:05:09.630" style="s2">and panic although they may be a very</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.410" end="00:05:13.230" style="s2">natural response just aren&#39;t a useful</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.630" end="00:05:14.850" style="s2">response okay so that&#39;s that&#39;s that part</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.230" end="00:05:15.840" style="s2">now I think most what we&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.850" end="00:05:18.600" style="s2">talking about is actually pretty</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.840" end="00:05:19.920" style="s2">intellectual that is not to say that we</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.600" end="00:05:21.780" style="s2">believe that the solution is in fact</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.920" end="00:05:24.990" style="s2">even largely intellectual there was a</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.780" end="00:05:25.890" style="s2">piece for the mind to play but in fact</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.990" end="00:05:28.620" style="s2">some of the questions that came from</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.890" end="00:05:30.030" style="s2">Facebook the basic answer is heart so I</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.620" end="00:05:30.840" style="s2">think this is a great place to begin the</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.030" end="00:05:34.410" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.840" end="00:05:37.080" style="s2">I guess publicly one concept that I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.410" end="00:05:39.030" style="s2">like to download before I hand off to</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.080" end="00:05:42.660" style="s2">Daniel is a framework that a friend of</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.030" end="00:05:44.880" style="s2">mine Dave Snowden not Edie Snowden but</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.660" end="00:05:47.970" style="s2">Dave student introduced about ten years</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.880" end="00:05:49.830" style="s2">ago for thinking about the different</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.970" end="00:05:51.960" style="s2">kinds of ordered systems that we find</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.830" end="00:05:53.490" style="s2">ourselves in sciences ready this is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.960" end="00:05:54.980" style="s2">very intellectual framework but I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.490" end="00:05:58.650" style="s2">we can do it quickly</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.980" end="00:06:00.870" style="s2">the first kind of system is a simple</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.650" end="00:06:04.200" style="s2">system and this is something like the</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.870" end="00:06:07.200" style="s2">way of pendulum swings back and forth or</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.200" end="00:06:10.320" style="s2">a game of tic-tac-toe where the phase</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.200" end="00:06:12.090" style="s2">space which is the state the set is of</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.320" end="00:06:13.980" style="s2">available states in the system is</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.090" end="00:06:16.530" style="s2">relatively small at the total number of</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.980" end="00:06:18.810" style="s2">tic-tac-toe games and can fit on a pages</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.530" end="00:06:20.220" style="s2">not that many things and so even a child</p>

<p begin="00:06:31.590" end="00:06:36.390" style="s2">building and these are things like say</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.420" end="00:06:38.370" style="s2">the Boeing 777 or the National energy</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.390" end="00:06:41.850" style="s2">grid or interstate highway system things</p>

<p begin="00:06:49.830" end="00:06:53.010" style="s2">you could never master them but if you</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.960" end="00:06:54.750" style="s2">spend enough time with them you can</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.010" end="00:06:56.070" style="s2">build up an expertise and understand</p>

<p begin="00:07:05.880" end="00:07:11.670" style="s2">complicated systems is a kind of a</p>

<p begin="00:07:14.590" end="00:07:18.790" style="s2">now the thing about complicated systems</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.080" end="00:07:20.650" style="s2">that distinguishes them from complex</p>

<p begin="00:07:20.650" end="00:07:26.139" style="s2">very large it doesn&#39;t change and so once</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.830" end="00:07:27.970" style="s2">you&#39;ve figured out the Boeing 777 you</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.139" end="00:07:29.410" style="s2">can print out the whole manual put it</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.970" end="00:07:32.800" style="s2">aside and look it up and then that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.410" end="00:07:35.380" style="s2">that in a complex system things do</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.800" end="00:07:38.050" style="s2">change it&#39;s interesting about complex</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.380" end="00:07:40.030" style="s2">systems is on the one hand it&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.050" end="00:07:41.889" style="s2">been about three or four decades that</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.030" end="00:07:44.680" style="s2">we&#39;ve even been thinking about them</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.889" end="00:07:46.840" style="s2">seriously like the name is an even more</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.680" end="00:07:48.070" style="s2">than three decades old we&#39;re just really</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.840" end="00:07:50.500" style="s2">beginning to get a handle on what these</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.070" end="00:07:53.169" style="s2">things are and how they operate and on</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.500" end="00:07:56.020" style="s2">the other hand things like our bodies</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.169" end="00:07:58.330" style="s2">our minds or relationships or ecology or</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.020" end="00:08:00.130" style="s2">economies those are all complex systems</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.330" end="00:08:03.160" style="s2">which is to say all the stuff we</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.130" end="00:08:04.540" style="s2">actually care about is complex and a big</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.160" end="00:08:07.270" style="s2">part of the game that we&#39;ve been playing</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.540" end="00:08:09.280" style="s2">as people for the past fifteen thousand</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.270" end="00:08:12.370" style="s2">years at least has been trying to use</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.280" end="00:08:15.100" style="s2">complicated stuff to manage complex</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.370" end="00:08:18.160" style="s2">stuff and this generates a real problem</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.100" end="00:08:20.710" style="s2">you see in a complex system things like</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.160" end="00:08:22.960" style="s2">causation is are almost impossible to</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.710" end="00:08:24.640" style="s2">really figure out you can&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.960" end="00:08:26.289" style="s2">predictions with precision but exactly</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.640" end="00:08:28.690" style="s2">what your impact is going to have on the</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.289" end="00:08:31.360" style="s2">system feedback loops feed-forward loops</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.690" end="00:08:33.339" style="s2">emergent properties new capacities it</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.360" end="00:08:36.330" style="s2">didn&#39;t even exist evolution these are</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.339" end="00:08:39.250" style="s2">all characteristics of complexity and</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.330" end="00:08:40.930" style="s2">one of the big problems in some sense a</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.250" end="00:08:42.909" style="s2">nature of the the problem we&#39;re facing</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.930" end="00:08:45.520" style="s2">is that when you have a complicated</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.909" end="00:08:48.490" style="s2">system trying to manage a complex system</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.520" end="00:08:50.290" style="s2">as the complex system changes which is</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.490" end="00:08:52.000" style="s2">what is going to do the complicated</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.290" end="00:08:55.000" style="s2">system has become more complicated to</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.000" end="00:08:56.770" style="s2">deal with the the failure modes and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.000" end="00:08:57.820" style="s2">it gets more and more complicated and</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.770" end="00:08:59.800" style="s2">more and more complicated until</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.820" end="00:09:01.720" style="s2">eventually it&#39;s so complicated that you</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.800" end="00:09:03.760" style="s2">can&#39;t manage it and then it has to do</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.720" end="00:09:06.970" style="s2">something that Dave student calls takes</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.760" end="00:09:09.880" style="s2">a journey through chaos and chaos is the</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.970" end="00:09:12.700" style="s2">force kind of system and we don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.880" end="00:09:14.709" style="s2">chaos chaos is generally a very sad</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.700" end="00:09:16.120" style="s2">place to be and we might even want to</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.709" end="00:09:18.550" style="s2">say that we don&#39;t want to take a journey</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.120" end="00:09:19.959" style="s2">through chaos but it seems unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.550" end="00:09:22.060" style="s2">rather unlikely we&#39;re going to be able</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.959" end="00:09:25.089" style="s2">to do that because every single time a</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.060" end="00:09:27.670" style="s2">truly complicated system has to adapt to</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.089" end="00:09:28.279" style="s2">a complexity can&#39;t manage the way that</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.670" end="00:09:30.410" style="s2">it breaks</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.279" end="00:09:32.120" style="s2">is it disorderly and it goes through</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.410" end="00:09:34.999" style="s2">chaos and then you come back into</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.120" end="00:09:37.670" style="s2">authentic complexity so it might be the</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.999" end="00:09:40.040" style="s2">case and something to consider that our</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.670" end="00:09:43.009" style="s2">job right now is twofold</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.040" end="00:09:45.559" style="s2">first is to figure out how to position</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.009" end="00:09:48.379" style="s2">ourselves so that we can in fact endure</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.559" end="00:09:50.569" style="s2">the chaos possibly even be anti Fraser</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.379" end="00:09:52.790" style="s2">to the chaos and you use the chaos to</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.569" end="00:09:56.360" style="s2">build something very positive and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.790" end="00:09:58.879" style="s2">second to do what we can now to envision</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.360" end="00:10:01.910" style="s2">what a future looks like that embraces</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.879" end="00:10:03.620" style="s2">complexity authentically does that</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.910" end="00:10:05.809" style="s2">retain complexity to work with</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.620" end="00:10:07.069" style="s2">complexity and build a civilization or</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.809" end="00:10:08.779" style="s2">whatever we would want to call it maybe</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.069" end="00:10:10.819" style="s2">something completely different that is</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.779" end="00:10:18.170" style="s2">directly related to the natural dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.819" end="00:10:20.720" style="s2">of complexity okay so Jordan used the</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.170" end="00:10:23.499" style="s2">word anti fragile which means resilient</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.720" end="00:10:27.709" style="s2">if we can get the game down a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.499" end="00:10:29.480" style="s2">but more than just resilient it means</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.709" end="00:10:31.399" style="s2">that when things come up that are going</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.480" end="00:10:34.129" style="s2">to be deviations from the homeo dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.399" end="00:10:36.199" style="s2">of that system it&#39;s not only going to</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.129" end="00:10:37.519" style="s2">not break but it&#39;s going to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.199" end="00:10:38.660" style="s2">learn from them in the systems going to</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.519" end="00:10:41.300" style="s2">evolve you mentioned that complex</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.660" end="00:10:43.910" style="s2">systems are evolving so complicated</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.300" end="00:10:46.879" style="s2">systems are not self-organizing right</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.910" end="00:10:48.079" style="s2">the 747 is a designed externally</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.879" end="00:10:49.550" style="s2">designed thing as opposed to a</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.079" end="00:10:51.860" style="s2">self-organizing an emergent thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.550" end="00:10:53.949" style="s2">another key distinction you notice that</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.860" end="00:10:56.170" style="s2">our human civilization systems are macro</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.949" end="00:10:58.040" style="s2">economic systems the way we think about</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.170" end="00:10:59.839" style="s2">putting the principles of them together</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.040" end="00:11:01.579" style="s2">our governance systems especially our</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.839" end="00:11:03.649" style="s2">infrastructure are complicated systems</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.579" end="00:11:06.759" style="s2">but they interface with the complex</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.649" end="00:11:09.230" style="s2">systems of ecology of human psyches of</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.759" end="00:11:11.120" style="s2">the social you know human social</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.230" end="00:11:14.269" style="s2">dynamics and the behavioral dynamics of</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.120" end="00:11:16.069" style="s2">economies and so it&#39;s important to get</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.269" end="00:11:17.870" style="s2">that our built world or human built</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.069" end="00:11:21.019" style="s2">world is not anti fragile it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.870" end="00:11:23.990" style="s2">self-organizing right and so it&#39;s it is</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.019" end="00:11:25.759" style="s2">fragile to collapse and we&#39;ve seen this</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.990" end="00:11:28.639" style="s2">if we look at civilizations throughout</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.759" end="00:11:30.829" style="s2">history they didn&#39;t all fare well right</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.639" end="00:11:33.050" style="s2">and it&#39;s important to get that because</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.829" end="00:11:35.089" style="s2">since we didn&#39;t go through Easter Island</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.050" end="00:11:36.740" style="s2">and we didn&#39;t go through the collapse of</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.089" end="00:11:38.300" style="s2">most of the things that were called</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.740" end="00:11:40.459" style="s2">civilizations in the past and in our</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.300" end="00:11:41.690" style="s2">life we haven&#39;t gone to that at all we</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.459" end="00:11:43.280" style="s2">don&#39;t actually have an expiry</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.690" end="00:11:46.040" style="s2">reenter intuition poor really</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.280" end="00:11:47.870" style="s2">breaking down and so it seems like that</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.040" end="00:11:49.370" style="s2">just couldn&#39;t really happen intuitively</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.870" end="00:11:51.080" style="s2">because we haven&#39;t been exposed to it</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.370" end="00:11:54.010" style="s2">intuition is conditioned by our</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.080" end="00:11:56.660" style="s2">experience our intuition is not adequate</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.010" end="00:11:58.190" style="s2">right our experiential intuitions not</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.660" end="00:12:01.430" style="s2">adequate for the scope of what we face</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.190" end="00:12:05.480" style="s2">this is a super important topic and so</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.430" end="00:12:07.610" style="s2">when we look at Syria we see that their</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.480" end="00:12:09.200" style="s2">complicated system right there their</p>

<p begin="00:12:09.200" end="00:12:14.090" style="s2">has radically collapsed we see that it</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.810" end="00:12:15.650" style="s2">was complex dynamics that led to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.090" end="00:12:17.450" style="s2">collapse of that scenario and the lack</p>

<p begin="00:12:17.450" end="00:12:21.140" style="s2">who are there lots of complex right</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.730" end="00:12:23.630" style="s2">there were economic motives there were</p>

<p begin="00:13:10.100" end="00:13:19.010" style="s2">it so we&#39;ve we can think about phases</p>

<p begin="00:13:19.010" end="00:13:21.710" style="s2">people have brought up the point right</p>

<p begin="00:13:21.710" end="00:13:27.380" style="s2">of Western civilization he said I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.270" end="00:13:29.089" style="s2">it would be a good idea and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.380" end="00:13:31.760" style="s2">actually a meaningful point right</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.089" end="00:13:33.320" style="s2">because he&#39;s saying it and Jacque fresco</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.760" end="00:13:36.920" style="s2">has famously said this many people&#39;s as</p>

<p begin="00:13:38.120" end="00:13:42.800" style="s2">stuff and as long as killing each other</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.740" end="00:13:45.740" style="s2">is a reasonable solution to conflict</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.800" end="00:13:48.080" style="s2">resolution is it fair to call that</p>

<p begin="00:13:50.150" end="00:13:54.579" style="s2">maybe civilization and Humana</p>

<p begin="00:14:05.409" end="00:14:09.939" style="s2">navigate towards that so when we talk</p>

<p begin="00:14:09.939" end="00:14:13.119" style="s2">usually we&#39;re talking about the history</p>

<p begin="00:14:13.119" end="00:14:18.819" style="s2">usually the timeframe that we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.739" end="00:14:20.619" style="s2">about and we we look at phases right</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.819" end="00:14:23.889" style="s2">we&#39;ll call you know hunter-gatherer</p>

<p begin="00:14:49.629" end="00:14:57.639" style="s2">lose game theoretic dynamics so if you</p>

<p begin="00:14:59.859" end="00:15:05.709" style="s2">you decide to kill each other as a</p>

<p begin="00:15:06.849" end="00:15:11.889" style="s2">everybody and not the whole ecosystem if</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.649" end="00:15:13.809" style="s2">you&#39;re going to race to pull out the</p>

<p begin="00:15:13.809" end="00:15:19.269" style="s2">fat faster but you are doing it with</p>

<p begin="00:15:19.269" end="00:15:24.429" style="s2">not all right but as your tools are</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.149" end="00:15:26.229" style="s2">going through exponential increases in</p>

<p begin="00:15:26.229" end="00:15:31.809" style="s2">world then the capacity to cause damage</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.979" end="00:15:35.979" style="s2">will actually leads to a place where win</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.809" end="00:15:37.720" style="s2">lose becomes lose lose right when when</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.979" end="00:15:39.729" style="s2">you go from stone tools to guns to</p>

<p begin="00:15:39.729" end="00:15:46.299" style="s2">there is no such thing as winning a war</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.189" end="00:15:48.179" style="s2">at that level and so when lose attempt</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.299" end="00:15:51.819" style="s2">becomes Omni lose-lose for everybody</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.179" end="00:15:53.799" style="s2">right when you go towards racing towards</p>

<p begin="00:15:53.799" end="00:15:58.209" style="s2">fast enough with the kinds of industrial</p>

<p begin="00:15:58.209" end="00:16:01.379" style="s2">so much faster than they can regenerate</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.159" end="00:16:03.779" style="s2">that&#39;s Omni lose</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.379" end="00:16:07.699" style="s2">for everybody so we&#39;re going through a</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.779" end="00:16:10.499" style="s2">shift where we either have lose lose</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.699" end="00:16:14.279" style="s2">motivational dynamics or Omni win-win</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.499" end="00:16:17.489" style="s2">and there&#39;s no spaces in between we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.279" end="00:16:20.399" style="s2">never had an omni win-win worldview</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.489" end="00:16:23.159" style="s2">right we had win for everybody in our</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.399" end="00:16:24.689" style="s2">civilization but usually not even that</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.159" end="00:16:26.669" style="s2">it&#39;s like when for the ruling class and</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.689" end="00:16:28.649" style="s2">the civilization at the cost of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.669" end="00:16:31.319" style="s2">peasant classes that do all the worth in</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.649" end="00:16:34.709" style="s2">the labor force etc so what does it mean</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.319" end="00:16:36.539" style="s2">to really recognize with the level at</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.709" end="00:16:39.329" style="s2">which we can affect each other because</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.539" end="00:16:43.829" style="s2">of exponential technology requires that</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.329" end="00:16:45.269" style="s2">we take full consideration for making</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.829" end="00:16:46.799" style="s2">sure that we&#39;re not externalizing harm</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.269" end="00:16:49.519" style="s2">of that effect on the planet that can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.799" end="00:16:53.009" style="s2">handle the externalization load anymore</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.519" end="00:16:54.629" style="s2">so you know we will use the term Omni</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.009" end="00:16:55.799" style="s2">considerate and obviously we can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.629" end="00:16:57.209" style="s2">fully Omni considered but it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:16:59.099" end="00:17:04.429" style="s2">there is no externality gap right we can</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.949" end="00:17:07.679" style="s2">say that the future of macroeconomics</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.429" end="00:17:10.259" style="s2">one of the defining criteria has to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.679" end="00:17:12.449" style="s2">that the incentive of every agent in the</p>

<p begin="00:17:12.449" end="00:17:16.559" style="s2">of people has to be aligned with the</p>

<p begin="00:17:28.019" end="00:17:32.190" style="s2">meets that criteria looks like no system</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.149" end="00:17:34.200" style="s2">of economics that we have ever had it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.190" end="00:17:36.539" style="s2">not Marxism it&#39;s not socialism it&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="00:17:58.470" end="00:18:03.539" style="s2">what that means is that the way we solve</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.200" end="00:18:06.659" style="s2">problems previously is becoming more and</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.539" end="00:18:08.789" style="s2">more obsolete faster and faster with</p>

<p begin="00:18:13.220" end="00:18:19.080" style="s2">and so when we think about exponential</p>

<p begin="00:18:19.080" end="00:18:22.710" style="s2">where our tools give us more ability to</p>

<p begin="00:19:01.740" end="00:19:05.669" style="s2">humanity we have to fix that issue right</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.320" end="00:19:07.409" style="s2">we have to make sure that we have</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.669" end="00:19:09.779" style="s2">exponential increase in our choice</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.409" end="00:19:11.610" style="s2">making capacity and you can you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.779" end="00:19:14.159" style="s2">Jordan said it almost feels mythic right</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.610" end="00:19:16.250" style="s2">like the coming of the end of an age and</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.159" end="00:19:19.440" style="s2">the possible emergence of a new age</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.250" end="00:19:21.840" style="s2">there it&#39;s reasonable right to think of</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.440" end="00:19:23.250" style="s2">those metaphors and so if you think of</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.840" end="00:19:24.690" style="s2">it in the mythic sense as people as</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.250" end="00:19:27.240" style="s2">we&#39;re scaling towards having the power</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.690" end="00:19:28.919" style="s2">of gods if we don&#39;t have the wisdom and</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.240" end="00:19:31.250" style="s2">consideration and love of gods and that</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.919" end="00:19:35.700" style="s2">power is inexorably self terminating</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.250" end="00:19:37.740" style="s2">right so we have to move from</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.700" end="00:19:39.690" style="s2">complicated system designed to actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.740" end="00:19:42.360" style="s2">understanding complexity there&#39;s a as</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.690" end="00:19:44.850" style="s2">one example of many of our frameworks of</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.360" end="00:19:47.250" style="s2">problem solving having to change we also</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.850" end="00:19:49.440" style="s2">have to move from thinking that we can</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.250" end="00:19:51.330" style="s2">solve some of our problems independent</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.440" end="00:19:52.919" style="s2">of or at the expense of others as a</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.330" end="00:19:56.640" style="s2">reasonable approach that also has to</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.919" end="00:19:58.049" style="s2">change and so where there were local</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.640" end="00:19:59.309" style="s2">issues before when the people died on</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.049" end="00:20:02.010" style="s2">Easter Island it didn&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.309" end="00:20:04.169" style="s2">impact everybody right we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.010" end="00:20:06.179" style="s2">that scenario we have these radically</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.169" end="00:20:07.950" style="s2">interconnected global issues where the</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.179" end="00:20:10.320" style="s2">oceans dying is that everybody issue and</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.950" end="00:20:13.110" style="s2">anyone contributing right any nation</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.320" end="00:20:16.110" style="s2">contributing to those dynamics ends up</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.110" end="00:20:18.360" style="s2">affecting all of us so you know nations</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.110" end="00:20:20.640" style="s2">made sense when the level at which we</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.360" end="00:20:22.139" style="s2">affected things was a kind of a national</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.640" end="00:20:23.279" style="s2">level and we could govern at the level</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.139" end="00:20:25.550" style="s2">that we affect things but where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.279" end="00:20:27.830" style="s2">affecting things at a global level</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.550" end="00:20:31.130" style="s2">we have to really govern and think about</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.830" end="00:20:32.990" style="s2">that space right so the idea that there</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.130" end="00:20:34.400" style="s2">can be collapsed somewhere and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.990" end="00:20:37.000" style="s2">unaffected by it and we get to make it</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.400" end="00:20:39.770" style="s2">through that&#39;s also an obsolete idea and</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.000" end="00:20:41.060" style="s2">on a very short timescale if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.770" end="00:20:43.580" style="s2">the different groups that are looking at</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.060" end="00:20:45.740" style="s2">catastrophic risk and existential risk</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.580" end="00:20:47.420" style="s2">there&#39;s variance and what the timescales</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.740" end="00:20:48.950" style="s2">are but they&#39;re all profoundly shorter</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.420" end="00:20:52.180" style="s2">than most of us think about on a daily</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.950" end="00:20:56.480" style="s2">basis how many people here feel that</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.180" end="00:21:01.250" style="s2">right feel the sense of imminent shift</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.480" end="00:21:02.600" style="s2">right so when you have a system that</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.250" end="00:21:04.670" style="s2">where some things are getting</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.600" end="00:21:05.810" style="s2">exponentially better more powerful other</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.670" end="00:21:07.370" style="s2">things are getting exponentially worse</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.810" end="00:21:08.570" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean the system is going in</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.370" end="00:21:10.010" style="s2">either those directions it means it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.570" end="00:21:11.780" style="s2">destabilizing and you&#39;re getting to the</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.010" end="00:21:13.760" style="s2">end of that phase you&#39;re either going to</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.780" end="00:21:15.380" style="s2">get a phase shift down to a much lower</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.760" end="00:21:17.150" style="s2">level of organization which looks like</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.380" end="00:21:19.460" style="s2">things that none of us want or a phase</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.150" end="00:21:21.100" style="s2">shift up discretely to a fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.460" end="00:21:23.990" style="s2">different set of organizational and</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.100" end="00:21:27.380" style="s2">motivational and and even identity</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.990" end="00:21:28.850" style="s2">worldview dynamics so that&#39;s what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.380" end="00:21:43.280" style="s2">here to talk about and explore more</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.850" end="00:21:46.580" style="s2">tonight some design principles that are</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.280" end="00:21:48.920" style="s2">relevant so I&#39;m going to pick up on a</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.580" end="00:21:51.740" style="s2">few of the themes that that have been</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.920" end="00:21:53.180" style="s2">raised by my good friends one of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.740" end="00:21:56.690" style="s2">themes that has been raised as the</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.180" end="00:21:58.280" style="s2">notion of complexity and in a way of</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.690" end="00:21:59.630" style="s2">thinking of things we can actually say</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.280" end="00:22:01.040" style="s2">that these these concepts have</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.630" end="00:22:04.100" style="s2">relationships to one another that these</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.040" end="00:22:05.600" style="s2">themes come together when we&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.100" end="00:22:07.250" style="s2">at complexity how do we deal with</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.600" end="00:22:09.170" style="s2">complexity what is the tools that we use</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.250" end="00:22:11.180" style="s2">to deal with complexity well there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.170" end="00:22:13.280" style="s2">other concepts that come to mind one of</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.180" end="00:22:16.160" style="s2">them is simplicity and the other is</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.280" end="00:22:17.390" style="s2">clarity these three concepts always</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.160" end="00:22:19.250" style="s2">occur together they don&#39;t ever occur</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.390" end="00:22:21.380" style="s2">separately where there is something that</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.250" end="00:22:22.730" style="s2">is complex there&#39;s also something else</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.380" end="00:22:25.610" style="s2">that is simple and there is also</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.730" end="00:22:27.710" style="s2">something else that is clear so the idea</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.610" end="00:22:30.620" style="s2">is and to try to reduce complexity into</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.710" end="00:22:32.120" style="s2">some state of simplicity or to try to</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.620" end="00:22:34.490" style="s2">see it only through the terms of</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.120" end="00:22:37.160" style="s2">something which is simple but to</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.490" end="00:22:38.630" style="s2">actually use the tool of clarity to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.160" end="00:22:39.340" style="s2">able to deal with complexity so in</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.630" end="00:22:40.300" style="s2">effect what I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.340" end="00:22:43.000" style="s2">try to do is I&#39;m gonna try to be really</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.300" end="00:22:44.650" style="s2">clear about some of the ideas that that</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.000" end="00:22:47.260" style="s2">have come forward that we have about</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.650" end="00:22:48.970" style="s2">what sort of toolkit can we bring to</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.260" end="00:22:52.150" style="s2">bear on the kinds of problems that are</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.970" end="00:22:54.370" style="s2">facing us we know that the solutions</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.150" end="00:22:56.740" style="s2">that have been brought forward to create</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.370" end="00:22:58.150" style="s2">the civilization that we&#39;re now in are</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.740" end="00:23:00.370" style="s2">no longer adequate for dealing with the</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.150" end="00:23:02.950" style="s2">problem and when we try to even identify</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.370" end="00:23:06.880" style="s2">what the problem is we recognize that</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.950" end="00:23:08.410" style="s2">like life itself it&#39;s very complex so</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.880" end="00:23:11.260" style="s2">the effort is essentially to try to</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.410" end="00:23:14.050" style="s2">bring a kind of clarity to the process</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.260" end="00:23:16.720" style="s2">what is the essence of what is going on</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.050" end="00:23:18.460" style="s2">how do we how do we understand it how do</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.720" end="00:23:21.670" style="s2">we relate to it what ways can we</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.460" end="00:23:23.050" style="s2">influence or be influenced by it and so</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.670" end="00:23:24.640" style="s2">when we&#39;re looking at design when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.050" end="00:23:26.830" style="s2">trying to think about okay we&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.640" end="00:23:28.510" style="s2">position of having these conversations</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.830" end="00:23:30.580" style="s2">about choices about the choices we make</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.510" end="00:23:32.530" style="s2">individually about the choices we make</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.580" end="00:23:34.030" style="s2">collectively as a community as of</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.530" end="00:23:37.240" style="s2">choices we make collectively as a nation</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.030" end="00:23:39.730" style="s2">or as a globe and so in effect a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.240" end="00:23:42.760" style="s2">the exercise comes down to what are the</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.730" end="00:23:45.730" style="s2">principles of effective choice how do we</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.760" end="00:23:47.590" style="s2">choose together how do we align</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.730" end="00:23:49.690" style="s2">ourselves so that the choices that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.590" end="00:23:52.300" style="s2">making are good choices and what does it</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.690" end="00:23:54.280" style="s2">mean to make a good choice how would we</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.300" end="00:23:55.810" style="s2">know it how would we recognize it how</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.280" end="00:23:57.610" style="s2">would we understand whether the design</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.810" end="00:23:58.990" style="s2">that we&#39;re proposing to solve a</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.610" end="00:24:00.880" style="s2">particular problem is actually a good</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.990" end="00:24:03.490" style="s2">design it&#39;s something that would create</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.880" end="00:24:05.860" style="s2">a solution that is enduring that is anti</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.490" end="00:24:07.090" style="s2">fragile that would in effect create a</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.860" end="00:24:11.710" style="s2">state of health create a state of</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.090" end="00:24:14.200" style="s2">thriving we want to use whatever choices</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.710" end="00:24:15.730" style="s2">we make individually to try to move the</p>

<p begin="00:24:15.730" end="00:24:19.920" style="s2">we&#39;re in into a phase transition that is</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.770" end="00:24:22.690" style="s2">in a sense a healthier way of being and</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.920" end="00:24:24.970" style="s2">to do that we would want to of course</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.690" end="00:24:27.220" style="s2">have some idea of what health is so that</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.970" end="00:24:28.960" style="s2">we can recognize it we want to</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.220" end="00:24:31.450" style="s2">appreciate the kinds of dynamics that</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.960" end="00:24:33.220" style="s2">create systems that could actually have</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.450" end="00:24:35.050" style="s2">a sense of vitality to them that we</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.220" end="00:24:36.850" style="s2">would want to be a part of because we</p>

<p begin="00:24:36.850" end="00:24:42.310" style="s2">lives for our family for the quality of</p>

<p begin="00:24:45.310" end="00:24:51.100" style="s2">that&#39;s balanced in a way that is</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.600" end="00:24:52.450" style="s2">essentially Omni considerate well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.100" end="00:24:54.730" style="s2">a complicated problem</p>

<p begin="00:24:56.289" end="00:25:00.129" style="s2">in order to have designs that are</p>

<p begin="00:27:30.820" end="00:27:34.990" style="s2">the minimum necessary and sufficient</p>

<p begin="00:27:39.430" end="00:27:42.760" style="s2">an example so I I do a lot of product</p>

<p begin="00:27:42.760" end="00:27:47.880" style="s2">things we sell them to the commercial</p>

<p begin="00:27:51.580" end="00:27:54.820" style="s2">want to I want to make this thing and I</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.560" end="00:27:57.220" style="s2">want to sell it to people and so on and</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.820" end="00:27:59.140" style="s2">so forth and you know I look at it and</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.220" end="00:28:01.810" style="s2">and you know we have a conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.140" end="00:28:04.270" style="s2">I ask a few questions I ask okay so you</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.810" end="00:28:05.620" style="s2">know do we have the materials can we can</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.270" end="00:28:08.560" style="s2">we source the stuff that this thing is</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.620" end="00:28:10.120" style="s2">made of can we build the tools that that</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.560" end="00:28:12.850" style="s2">that are necessary to make this thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.120" end="00:28:14.680" style="s2">can we train the people to to use the</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.850" end="00:28:17.290" style="s2">tools to make the product can we afford</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.680" end="00:28:20.170" style="s2">to have you know can we pay people to do</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.290" end="00:28:22.240" style="s2">that has anybody thought about the</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.170" end="00:28:23.650" style="s2">instructions that are necessary to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.240" end="00:28:26.410" style="s2">read by the person that&#39;s going to use</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.650" end="00:28:27.730" style="s2">this thing is there an idea of how</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.410" end="00:28:29.440" style="s2">you&#39;re going to present it to the market</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.730" end="00:28:32.980" style="s2">do you know who the beneficiary of this</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.440" end="00:28:34.540" style="s2">work is do you understand all of the the</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.980" end="00:28:36.010" style="s2">kinds of relationships that are going to</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.540" end="00:28:38.080" style="s2">evolve in the marketplace and how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.010" end="00:28:39.880" style="s2">going to change the market have you</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.080" end="00:28:41.590" style="s2">accounted for what happens with the</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.880" end="00:28:42.910" style="s2">product after a person is done using it</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.590" end="00:28:44.710" style="s2">where does it eventually go in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.910" end="00:28:46.150" style="s2">environment does it come back to the</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.710" end="00:28:47.940" style="s2">manufacturer and you recycle it somehow</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.150" end="00:28:49.750" style="s2">or another does it end up in a landfill</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.940" end="00:28:51.220" style="s2">and when we look at things like</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.750" end="00:28:53.290" style="s2">pollution there&#39;s a sort of this</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.220" end="00:28:54.790" style="s2">realization that pollution happens the</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.290" end="00:28:56.980" style="s2">instant that something is made it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.790" end="00:28:58.900" style="s2">you know sometime later on when it ends</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.980" end="00:29:00.340" style="s2">up in the landfill as soon as we combine</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.900" end="00:29:03.040" style="s2">something that nature has no way of</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.340" end="00:29:06.040" style="s2">taking it apart we&#39;ve already become</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.040" end="00:29:08.530" style="s2">part of the problem so in effect we need</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.040" end="00:29:11.530" style="s2">to think about a much broader set of</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.530" end="00:29:13.390" style="s2">questions a much broader set of of ideas</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.530" end="00:29:15.640" style="s2">a much broader set of issues and</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.390" end="00:29:19.090" style="s2">characteristics in order for us to</p>

<p begin="00:29:19.090" end="00:29:24.590" style="s2">that we are even thinking about this an</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.340" end="00:29:27.890" style="s2">appropriate way are we even asking the</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.590" end="00:29:30.140" style="s2">right questions and how would we know so</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.890" end="00:29:31.460" style="s2">in a lot of ways that the details that</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.140" end="00:29:34.700" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to get to the things that</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.460" end="00:29:37.730" style="s2">are essentially really important how do</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.700" end="00:29:39.260" style="s2">we organize ourselves into communities</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.730" end="00:29:41.060" style="s2">of people that can collectively</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.260" end="00:29:43.520" style="s2">influence some of the situations that</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.060" end="00:29:45.230" style="s2">are affecting all of us what does it</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.520" end="00:29:47.600" style="s2">mean for us to essentially align our</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.230" end="00:29:49.120" style="s2">choices as agents into a way that</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.600" end="00:29:51.080" style="s2">actually makes sense what does that mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.120" end="00:29:53.840" style="s2">when we think about the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.080" end="00:29:57.710" style="s2">civilization in a lot of ways it comes</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.840" end="00:29:59.090" style="s2">down to a kind of conversation when I</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.710" end="00:30:02.510" style="s2">think of civilization I think of</p>

<p begin="00:30:10.250" end="00:30:14.060" style="s2">current culture has gotten very enamored</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.200" end="00:30:15.740" style="s2">with this so-called broadcast process</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.060" end="00:30:18.650" style="s2">here I am you know giving this</p>

<p begin="00:30:18.650" end="00:30:22.610" style="s2">like to actually rather than speaking at</p>

<p begin="00:30:47.480" end="00:30:52.060" style="s2">then we you know we deliver it right</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.980" end="00:30:54.350" style="s2">sort of a waterfall lifecycle design</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.060" end="00:30:56.150" style="s2">what we really need in this particular</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.350" end="00:30:59.870" style="s2">point is a kind of design a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.150" end="00:31:03.380" style="s2">conversation the rather than being from</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.870" end="00:31:07.250" style="s2">some sort of central single monolithic</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.380" end="00:31:10.760" style="s2">point of view has in a sense a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.250" end="00:31:14.030" style="s2">diffused integration it has a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.760" end="00:31:15.980" style="s2">organic quality to it we don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.030" end="00:31:17.990" style="s2">time to wait for evolution to figure</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.980" end="00:31:19.280" style="s2">this out and given some of the powers</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.990" end="00:31:21.800" style="s2">and capacities that we have developed</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.280" end="00:31:24.050" style="s2">technologically we uneffective have</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.800" end="00:31:26.540" style="s2">entered into the responsibility of being</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.050" end="00:31:29.720" style="s2">responsible for our own evolution being</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.540" end="00:31:31.820" style="s2">responsible for our own design so</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.720" end="00:31:32.690" style="s2">thinking about design questions in a way</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.820" end="00:31:37.190" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.690" end="00:31:40.669" style="s2">neither top down which is maybe accurate</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.190" end="00:31:43.580" style="s2">but not precise enough or bottom up</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.669" end="00:31:46.279" style="s2">which may be really really precise but</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.580" end="00:31:47.809" style="s2">take a long time we find ourselves in a</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.279" end="00:31:51.249" style="s2">situation where we need to come up with</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.809" end="00:31:54.739" style="s2">design capability design characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.249" end="00:31:59.029" style="s2">that have the rapidity of top-down but</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.739" end="00:32:01.340" style="s2">the effectiveness of bottom-up and so in</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.029" end="00:32:03.289" style="s2">a sense our exercise is essentially to</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.340" end="00:32:06.289" style="s2">develop a set of tools develop a set of</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.289" end="00:32:08.749" style="s2">conversations the set of intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.289" end="00:32:11.779" style="s2">building apparatus that allows us to</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.749" end="00:32:15.830" style="s2">deal with complexity in a profoundly</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.779" end="00:32:29.570" style="s2">clear way so that&#39;s what this</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.830" end="00:32:30.830" style="s2">conversation is about tonight so before</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.570" end="00:32:33.739" style="s2">we get to the questions and answers I</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.830" end="00:32:38.149" style="s2">just wanted to bring two more things one</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.739" end="00:32:40.789" style="s2">is a strategic framework for how at</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.149" end="00:32:42.409" style="s2">least I go about thinking about what I</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.789" end="00:32:45.139" style="s2">want to do and how I want to participate</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.409" end="00:32:46.489" style="s2">in this thing because I have certainly</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.139" end="00:32:47.899" style="s2">noticed over the past couple of decades</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.489" end="00:32:49.999" style="s2">that different people have different</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.899" end="00:32:52.220" style="s2">proclivities the different preferences</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.999" end="00:32:53.509" style="s2">they have different kinds of things that</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.220" end="00:32:55.909" style="s2">they&#39;re attracted to and things that are</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.509" end="00:32:58.039" style="s2">not interested in at all and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.909" end="00:32:59.299" style="s2">no one Pro try this every single person</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.039" end="00:33:01.759" style="s2">here is fully responsible for doing</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.299" end="00:33:04.869" style="s2">exactly what is theirs to do in this</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.759" end="00:33:08.989" style="s2">thing but it seems like there are three</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.869" end="00:33:11.690" style="s2">basic categories that things are pulling</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.989" end="00:33:13.340" style="s2">apart into an almost temporal so the</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.690" end="00:33:15.789" style="s2">first category is the category of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.340" end="00:33:19.879" style="s2">urgent there are things that are urgent</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.789" end="00:33:21.320" style="s2">things we must not let happen over the</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.879" end="00:33:23.210" style="s2">next couple of years and those aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.320" end="00:33:25.039" style="s2">too hard to guess and unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.210" end="00:33:26.690" style="s2">getting off too close to them things</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.039" end="00:33:28.039" style="s2">like say nuclear war among the great</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.690" end="00:33:30.229" style="s2">powers would be the sort of thing that</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.039" end="00:33:32.479" style="s2">we would must avoid over the next couple</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.229" end="00:33:34.909" style="s2">of years under the number actually of</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.479" end="00:33:37.759" style="s2">things that are absolutely urgent and</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.909" end="00:33:39.769" style="s2">must be avoided or in fact must it must</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.759" end="00:33:42.559" style="s2">happen over the next several years two</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.769" end="00:33:44.479" style="s2">three four years and if you&#39;re the kind</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.559" end="00:33:45.100" style="s2">of person who has the energy and</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.479" end="00:33:47.620" style="s2">commitment</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.100" end="00:33:49.480" style="s2">and ability to sacrifice to address</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.620" end="00:33:52.539" style="s2">those kinds of things that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.480" end="00:33:54.700" style="s2">place to go but if you are don&#39;t waste</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.539" end="00:33:56.320" style="s2">your time on things that require 15</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.700" end="00:33:58.570" style="s2">years of planning just a very those</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.320" end="00:34:01.120" style="s2">things are out of match the second</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.570" end="00:34:02.740" style="s2">category is a category or a lot of folks</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.120" end="00:34:04.750" style="s2">are spending time on right now and this</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.740" end="00:34:07.510" style="s2">is in the time frame maybe anchored on</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.750" end="00:34:08.679" style="s2">say seven years or 15 years somewhere in</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.510" end="00:34:10.990" style="s2">there depending on how things play out</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.679" end="00:34:13.000" style="s2">and I consider this to the period of</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.990" end="00:34:16.240" style="s2">transition and this is the period where</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.000" end="00:34:18.100" style="s2">we do our absolute level best to squeeze</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.240" end="00:34:21.369" style="s2">a couple more years out of the current</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.100" end="00:34:23.919" style="s2">civilization model to hold us as we</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.369" end="00:34:25.990" style="s2">engineer the transition so when we land</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.919" end="00:34:28.210" style="s2">it&#39;s a soft landing and so something</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.990" end="00:34:29.980" style="s2">like say Universal basic income which is</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.210" end="00:34:31.270" style="s2">was a question that was asked and is</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.980" end="00:34:34.240" style="s2">something that&#39;s getting more and more</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.270" end="00:34:36.609" style="s2">conscious now is in that category it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.240" end="00:34:39.159" style="s2">not post transition is transitional if</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.609" end="00:34:41.399" style="s2">it works it will get us to the next step</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.159" end="00:34:44.290" style="s2">but it will not be the next step itself</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.399" end="00:34:46.240" style="s2">and then the third stage is the stage</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.290" end="00:34:48.330" style="s2">that force is talking about the post</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.240" end="00:34:51.429" style="s2">transitional stage and that&#39;s extremely</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.330" end="00:34:54.030" style="s2">difficult this is the sort of thing that</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.429" end="00:34:56.440" style="s2">to be Raziel to be resilient to</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.030" end="00:34:59.020" style="s2">exponential technology is going to</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.440" end="00:35:01.480" style="s2">require a level of capability a level</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.020" end="00:35:02.980" style="s2">precision a level of design that we we</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.480" end="00:35:05.830" style="s2">can barely name and we haven&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.980" end="00:35:07.210" style="s2">fully figured out how to embody yet and</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.830" end="00:35:08.859" style="s2">it&#39;s going to take years right so heart</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.210" end="00:35:11.890" style="s2">in some sense if you&#39;re in the first two</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.859" end="00:35:14.080" style="s2">categories your job is to buy time so</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.890" end="00:35:15.280" style="s2">the people who are prepared to try to do</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.080" end="00:35:17.080" style="s2">the stuff at the post transition</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.280" end="00:35:18.670" style="s2">framework can get those things in place</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.080" end="00:35:21.340" style="s2">so we&#39;re actually have a good thing to</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.670" end="00:35:23.440" style="s2">land on and if you&#39;re a visionary who</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.340" end="00:35:25.600" style="s2">can input to put names against those</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.440" end="00:35:27.880" style="s2">things to seek out the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.600" end="00:35:29.560" style="s2">who are equipped to be able to take that</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.880" end="00:35:33.220" style="s2">vision and bring it into reality so</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.560" end="00:35:34.570" style="s2">that&#39;s one piece of material that I hope</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.220" end="00:35:37.960" style="s2">is helpful to people in thinking how to</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.570" end="00:35:40.210" style="s2">apply themselves the other is the</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.960" end="00:35:41.710" style="s2">hopeful side of this conversation and I</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.210" end="00:35:45.820" style="s2">had a conversation with our friend Brett</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.710" end="00:35:47.410" style="s2">I think maybe yesterday about a dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.820" end="00:35:48.760" style="s2">that&#39;s going on a number of different</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.410" end="00:35:51.760" style="s2">places and the new this group is</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.760" end="00:35:55.630" style="s2">certainly part of that which is what he</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.760" end="00:35:57.339" style="s2">will call the shamanic path and he&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.630" end="00:35:59.350" style="s2">evolutionary theorist and he put it this</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.339" end="00:36:02.050" style="s2">way said human beings actually tend to</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.350" end="00:36:03.580" style="s2">operate in two modes when things are</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.050" end="00:36:06.160" style="s2">going well or actually if things are</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.580" end="00:36:08.110" style="s2">going even marginally okay we tend to</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.160" end="00:36:09.730" style="s2">just kind of like stay where we are and</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.110" end="00:36:12.010" style="s2">run the code that we&#39;ve already written</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.730" end="00:36:13.600" style="s2">and we like that that&#39;s really safe</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.010" end="00:36:16.300" style="s2">because change is generally a very bad</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.600" end="00:36:18.370" style="s2">thing but when things are clearly not</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.300" end="00:36:21.040" style="s2">doing well then we actually have to</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.370" end="00:36:23.770" style="s2">shift into a different mode and we have</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.040" end="00:36:25.240" style="s2">to call up the shamanic energy you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.770" end="00:36:27.310" style="s2">people sitting around the fire and</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.240" end="00:36:29.440" style="s2">talking about things people dancing</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.310" end="00:36:31.390" style="s2">ecstatically people taking drugs to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.440" end="00:36:34.330" style="s2">able to think differently because as</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.390" end="00:36:36.400" style="s2">individuals we really can&#39;t think we do</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.330" end="00:36:37.690" style="s2">not sink as individuals we think as</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.400" end="00:36:39.460" style="s2">groups we think as groups in</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.690" end="00:36:41.500" style="s2">conversation with each other as forces</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.460" end="00:36:42.730" style="s2">saying really learning the art of coming</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.500" end="00:36:45.160" style="s2">together in groups that can have these</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.730" end="00:36:47.770" style="s2">conversations and rebirthing or actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.160" end="00:36:49.810" style="s2">calling out in ourselves the shamanic</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.770" end="00:36:51.550" style="s2">energy to be able to actually have the</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.810" end="00:36:54.370" style="s2">kind of consciousness necessary to do</p>

<p begin="00:36:54.370" end="00:36:59.440" style="s2">thing the thing to be done and the good</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.530" end="00:37:00.670" style="s2">news is is that even though we have only</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.440" end="00:37:02.080" style="s2">grown up in a time frame where these</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.670" end="00:37:07.270" style="s2">sorts of things haven&#39;t happened in our</p>

<p begin="00:37:09.550" end="00:37:13.390" style="s2">time frame so it&#39;s in us to do it and I</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.040" end="00:37:15.100" style="s2">imagine most people here actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.390" end="00:37:16.990" style="s2">feeling it and has felt for quite some</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.100" end="00:37:17.320" style="s2">time all the way down at the cellular</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.990" end="00:37:18.970" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.320" end="00:37:21.490" style="s2">so it&#39;s tuning into that and figuring</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.970" end="00:37:25.350" style="s2">how to recover that thing I think is</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.490" end="00:37:25.350" style="s2">also a big piece of the solution</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.280" end="00:37:38.610" style="s2">all right so we&#39;ve got some questions</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.250" end="00:37:41.010" style="s2">that have come in both online prior to</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.610" end="00:37:44.130" style="s2">this event as well as all of you I hope</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.010" end="00:37:46.560" style="s2">have been writing questions as as these</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.130" end="00:37:48.780" style="s2">gentleman have been sharing and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.560" end="00:37:49.680" style="s2">going to pass around a box in about five</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.780" end="00:37:52.950" style="s2">minutes</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.680" end="00:37:54.660" style="s2">to collect your questions and then</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.950" end="00:37:57.180" style="s2">they&#39;re going to be ordered and</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.660" end="00:37:59.460" style="s2">prioritized as best as possible and and</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.180" end="00:38:01.020" style="s2">shared so please if you haven&#39;t already</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.460" end="00:38:03.120" style="s2">if you have a burning question that you</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.020" end="00:38:05.010" style="s2">would think would be relevant to a large</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.120" end="00:38:07.020" style="s2">audience please that jot it down and</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.010" end="00:38:07.440" style="s2">that box will go around in about five</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.020" end="00:38:11.010" style="s2">minutes</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.440" end="00:38:14.340" style="s2">in the meantime we&#39;ve got some great</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.010" end="00:38:22.470" style="s2">ones that have come in online and let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.340" end="00:38:25.080" style="s2">start right here so there it is how can</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.470" end="00:38:30.590" style="s2">I most effectively evaluate and</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.080" end="00:38:30.590" style="s2">calibrate my own truth detection process</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.830" end="00:38:36.830" style="s2">how can i as objectively as possible</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.170" end="00:38:39.960" style="s2">find out if a problem is real or</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.830" end="00:38:42.630" style="s2">probably real versus an overreaction or</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.960" end="00:38:45.890" style="s2">a misperception about collective reality</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.630" end="00:38:45.890" style="s2">or reality itself</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.580" end="00:38:56.460" style="s2">first if you have found yourself</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.110" end="00:38:57.900" style="s2">responding to the environment let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.460" end="00:38:59.490" style="s2">for example you&#39;re a moment be very</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.900" end="00:39:01.980" style="s2">large number of people who responded to</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.490" end="00:39:06.900" style="s2">the 2016 election with some mixture of</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.980" end="00:39:08.790" style="s2">anger or fear stop those emotions are</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.900" end="00:39:12.420" style="s2">very effective at driving action the</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.790" end="00:39:13.440" style="s2">extremely poor at finding truth so relax</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.420" end="00:39:16.410" style="s2">slow down</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.440" end="00:39:18.510" style="s2">and I&#39;m not saying slow down in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.410" end="00:39:20.190" style="s2">faces of danger because there is danger</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.510" end="00:39:22.680" style="s2">but as our friends in the Marines say</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.190" end="00:39:25.080" style="s2">slow is smooth and smooth is fast become</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.680" end="00:39:28.710" style="s2">smooth so first if you&#39;re not smooth</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.080" end="00:39:30.750" style="s2">become smooth nothing else can be good</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.710" end="00:39:31.910" style="s2">until you are smooth this is very</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.750" end="00:39:35.750" style="s2">important right now</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.910" end="00:39:38.430" style="s2">second forced mention an unfortunate</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.750" end="00:39:40.230" style="s2">model we found ourselves trained into</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.430" end="00:39:42.360" style="s2">largely from birth if you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.230" end="00:39:44.320" style="s2">watching television certainly since you</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.360" end="00:39:47.200" style="s2">got to went to school which is too</p>

<p begin="00:39:47.200" end="00:39:52.060" style="s2">the recipient of information that comes</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.850" end="00:39:54.010" style="s2">from people who you&#39;ve never met and is</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.060" end="00:39:57.550" style="s2">broadcast out to a very large number of</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.010" end="00:39:59.320" style="s2">people that is broadly untrustworthy no</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.550" end="00:40:01.930" style="s2">matter what the origin source is if it</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.320" end="00:40:03.730" style="s2">is broadcast it is broadly untrustworthy</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.930" end="00:40:04.930" style="s2">which means that you can listen to it</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.730" end="00:40:06.580" style="s2">but you&#39;re gonna have to do a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.930" end="00:40:10.740" style="s2">work to make any sense out of it at all</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.580" end="00:40:13.360" style="s2">I spent about the last year now</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.740" end="00:40:15.420" style="s2">receiving information from hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.360" end="00:40:17.560" style="s2">descript sources that I painstakingly</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.420" end="00:40:20.770" style="s2">curate to make sure they are completely</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.560" end="00:40:21.880" style="s2">separate from each other and honestly I</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.770" end="00:40:24.070" style="s2">can&#39;t make sense of what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.880" end="00:40:25.360" style="s2">right now very well so it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.070" end="00:40:27.880" style="s2">unlikely that you&#39;re getting news from</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.360" end="00:40:29.380" style="s2">three or four sources that you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.880" end="00:40:31.180" style="s2">to be able to actually use that to make</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.380" end="00:40:33.580" style="s2">sense of what you in particular should</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.180" end="00:40:34.900" style="s2">be doing right I mean you may be able to</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.580" end="00:40:36.610" style="s2">get really angry about something&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.900" end="00:40:40.300" style="s2">on nowhere near you but that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.610" end="00:40:41.830" style="s2">help you so the key is in fact</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.300" end="00:40:45.100" style="s2">distinctive for us was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.830" end="00:40:46.720" style="s2">this the way we&#39;re going to do this is</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.100" end="00:40:49.360" style="s2">we&#39;re going to have to begin engaging in</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.720" end="00:40:51.760" style="s2">conversations with people we have to get</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.360" end="00:40:53.290" style="s2">in honestly we&#39;re in a situation where</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.760" end="00:40:54.610" style="s2">we we actually have the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.290" end="00:40:56.920" style="s2">engage in conversations with people all</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.610" end="00:40:58.510" style="s2">over the world and we can find them in</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.920" end="00:41:00.910" style="s2">talk with them and share with them</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.510" end="00:41:02.260" style="s2">authentically and listen to what it is</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.910" end="00:41:03.670" style="s2">they&#39;re actually trying to express</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.260" end="00:41:06.040" style="s2">regardless of with their words sound</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.670" end="00:41:07.720" style="s2">like to us and relearn the art of</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.040" end="00:41:11.620" style="s2">actually creating these new forms of</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.720" end="00:41:13.330" style="s2">collective consciousness and that may</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.620" end="00:41:16.150" style="s2">sound superficial but it is absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.330" end="00:41:19.270" style="s2">the opposite of superficial it is hard</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.150" end="00:41:23.170" style="s2">to do and people are crazy</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.270" end="00:41:25.930" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s nuts out there and and</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.170" end="00:41:28.530" style="s2">people also have crazy ideas like we use</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.930" end="00:41:31.570" style="s2">words to meet all kinds of weird things</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.530" end="00:41:34.000" style="s2">so it&#39;s beginning to build from the</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.570" end="00:41:35.140" style="s2">bottom up it is actually the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.000" end="00:41:36.940" style="s2">we&#39;re doing so it&#39;s not that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.140" end="00:41:39.250" style="s2">trying to find the truth so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.940" end="00:41:42.190" style="s2">figure out the next thing to do it is</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.250" end="00:41:44.890" style="s2">the thing we are doing and having the</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.190" end="00:41:47.020" style="s2">ability to in yourself be able to listen</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.890" end="00:41:48.990" style="s2">to things that make you respond</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.020" end="00:41:51.970" style="s2">emotional or make no sense to your mind</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.990" end="00:41:54.190" style="s2">learn how to ask questions how to listen</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.970" end="00:41:55.930" style="s2">to enter into dialogue how to seek out</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.190" end="00:41:57.850" style="s2">and find the people who have the thing</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.930" end="00:41:58.510" style="s2">that you need to share how to share what</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.850" end="00:41:59.980" style="s2">is yours</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.510" end="00:42:01.810" style="s2">right now I mean that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.980" end="00:42:03.850" style="s2">interesting challenge how do you not</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.810" end="00:42:04.900" style="s2">just run the response or persona tells</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.850" end="00:42:06.490" style="s2">you to get people to do the you</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.900" end="00:42:08.109" style="s2">want them to do how do you actually</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.490" end="00:42:10.960" style="s2">share what is actually yours that you</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.109" end="00:42:13.060" style="s2">were here to give that is a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.960" end="00:42:14.800" style="s2">lesson to learn and so that notion</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.060" end="00:42:18.450" style="s2">bidirectionally being able to do that</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.800" end="00:42:18.450" style="s2">that is my answer that question</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.800" end="00:42:25.780" style="s2">picking up on what Jordan said best</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.190" end="00:42:27.820" style="s2">source of information is people you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.780" end="00:42:29.560" style="s2">in other words rather than trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.820" end="00:42:30.760" style="s2">information from new sources of people</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.560" end="00:42:31.900" style="s2">you don&#39;t know you don&#39;t know the filter</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.760" end="00:42:34.000" style="s2">that that information is coming through</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.900" end="00:42:36.720" style="s2">right anything that&#39;s a broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.000" end="00:42:39.520" style="s2">communication anything is essentially a</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.720" end="00:42:41.680" style="s2">one-to-many communication transit</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.520" end="00:42:44.080" style="s2">transaction and when I say many I mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.680" end="00:42:45.640" style="s2">like thousands or more you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.080" end="00:42:47.920" style="s2">have essentially a conflict of</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.640" end="00:42:50.170" style="s2">motivation that is essentially there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.920" end="00:42:52.800" style="s2">there&#39;s a commoditization of attention</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.170" end="00:42:55.810" style="s2">and time your heart beats right that</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.800" end="00:42:58.510" style="s2">irreplaceable moments in your life which</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.810" end="00:43:00.880" style="s2">will never be repeated again okay so in</p>

<p begin="00:43:00.880" end="00:43:04.090" style="s2">want to sort of keep in mind is that we</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.950" end="00:43:06.880" style="s2">don&#39;t make sense of anything by</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.090" end="00:43:08.200" style="s2">ourselves we make sense of things in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.880" end="00:43:10.780" style="s2">community of people that we know and</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.200" end="00:43:13.119" style="s2">trust and in effects you know by knowing</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.780" end="00:43:15.130" style="s2">the person that is in a sense has in</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.119" end="00:43:16.810" style="s2">their awareness that you&#39;re interested</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.130" end="00:43:18.340" style="s2">in this particular topic or that they</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.810" end="00:43:20.109" style="s2">they have a way of thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.340" end="00:43:23.230" style="s2">that is very clear that they in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.109" end="00:43:25.030" style="s2">become a resource for you to know what</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.230" end="00:43:28.390" style="s2">that information actually means in</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.030" end="00:43:30.460" style="s2">context right to have someone be able to</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.390" end="00:43:31.750" style="s2">say here&#39;s my perspective on it but you</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.460" end="00:43:33.820" style="s2">know the kind of perspectives that they</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.750" end="00:43:36.970" style="s2">have gives you a lot more information a</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.820" end="00:43:38.560" style="s2">lot more sense making capacity than</p>

<p begin="00:43:44.260" end="00:43:48.869" style="s2">friends and we have conversations I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.780" end="00:43:51.340" style="s2">suggesting we do that a lot more and</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.869" end="00:43:53.710" style="s2">that we do it a lot more deliberately</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.340" end="00:43:55.990" style="s2">and that we do it with the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.710" end="00:43:59.740" style="s2">intention that is the specific intention</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.990" end="00:44:02.530" style="s2">of seeking insight that we in effect are</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.740" end="00:44:05.410" style="s2">trying to see through the perspective of</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.530" end="00:44:08.100" style="s2">another individual so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.410" end="00:44:09.950" style="s2">combine it with our own perspective</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.100" end="00:44:12.210" style="s2">and have a greater depth a greater</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.950" end="00:44:15.090" style="s2">dimensionality of perception than what</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.210" end="00:44:18.030" style="s2">otherwise be possible right we have to</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.090" end="00:44:20.340" style="s2">two of these organs we have two of these</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.030" end="00:44:21.960" style="s2">organs in fact we have this capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.340" end="00:44:24.330" style="s2">take the information that we see in each</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.960" end="00:44:26.460" style="s2">of these eyes and synthesize it together</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.330" end="00:44:28.740" style="s2">to perceive three dimensions where any</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.460" end="00:44:32.610" style="s2">single organ by itself would only see</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.740" end="00:44:34.380" style="s2">two and this is a technology this is</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.610" end="00:44:35.880" style="s2">actually a very powerful technology if I</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.380" end="00:44:37.710" style="s2">wanted to build a radio telescope that</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.880" end="00:44:41.040" style="s2">was bigger than the size of the planet I</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.710" end="00:44:43.020" style="s2">take the signal that is received at you</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.040" end="00:44:44.550" style="s2">know the middle of summer and then I</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.020" end="00:44:45.660" style="s2">wait six months and I take the signal</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.550" end="00:44:47.250" style="s2">that is received in the middle of winter</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.660" end="00:44:50.310" style="s2">and I combine them in a certain way and</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.250" end="00:44:52.140" style="s2">I get the effect as if I had built</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.310" end="00:44:55.620" style="s2">something that was the size of the orbit</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.140" end="00:44:57.480" style="s2">of the earth as an amazing amazing</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.620" end="00:45:00.440" style="s2">result it&#39;s like this this enormous</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.480" end="00:45:04.440" style="s2">multiplicative effect when we seek out</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.440" end="00:45:05.850" style="s2">diverse opinions diverse people you</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.440" end="00:45:07.200" style="s2">don&#39;t want to just talk to people that</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.850" end="00:45:10.200" style="s2">you know but you also want to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.200" end="00:45:12.870" style="s2">people that are interesting then in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.200" end="00:45:15.510" style="s2">sense you have a kind of intuition that</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.870" end="00:45:17.340" style="s2">something they say may combine in an</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.510" end="00:45:19.200" style="s2">interesting way with something that you</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.340" end="00:45:21.890" style="s2">would say to them and it through that</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.200" end="00:45:24.420" style="s2">sharing through that mutual experience</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.890" end="00:45:26.400" style="s2">that you will each perceive the world in</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.420" end="00:45:29.820" style="s2">a way that is more genuine more depth</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.400" end="00:45:31.980" style="s2">and that&#39;s what we mean to make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.820" end="00:45:34.650" style="s2">something so in a sense get to the point</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.980" end="00:45:40.010" style="s2">where we see into it to have insight is</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.650" end="00:45:42.660" style="s2">to see into so put your cell phones away</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.010" end="00:45:44.670" style="s2">get together for dinner and talk about</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.660" end="00:45:46.110" style="s2">some real right I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.670" end="00:45:47.970" style="s2">basically what it boils down to and</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.110" end="00:45:49.650" style="s2">remember what you remember what insights</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.970" end="00:45:51.180" style="s2">you have write it down you know put it</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.650" end="00:45:52.590" style="s2">put it in some sort of notebook or</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.180" end="00:45:54.090" style="s2">something and then the next conversation</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.590" end="00:45:55.920" style="s2">the next dinner party that you have</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.090" end="00:45:57.420" style="s2">bring out the best of the best of what</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.920" end="00:45:59.570" style="s2">you have in a sense come to insights for</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.420" end="00:46:01.980" style="s2">and synthesize that to a deeper level</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.570" end="00:46:04.500" style="s2">the more you go through this process the</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.980" end="00:46:06.900" style="s2">easier it is and the more insights that</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.500" end="00:46:08.280" style="s2">you gain more insights that we have into</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.900" end="00:46:13.460" style="s2">the kind of designs and the solutions</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.280" end="00:46:13.460" style="s2">that will constitute civilization 2.0</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.600" end="00:46:17.560" style="s2">I want to add to what these guys said</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.060" end="00:46:20.590" style="s2">because this might be the most important</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.560" end="00:46:25.540" style="s2">question of the night just to underscore</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.590" end="00:46:29.860" style="s2">the importance do we know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.540" end="00:46:31.810" style="s2">happening at Fukushima really or how</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.860" end="00:46:35.170" style="s2">long we have for coral reefs before we</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.810" end="00:46:37.420" style="s2">have to do what right how do we navigate</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.170" end="00:46:38.950" style="s2">how do we do collective choice making</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.420" end="00:46:41.260" style="s2">when we don&#39;t have collective sense</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.950" end="00:46:44.260" style="s2">making how do we prioritize it like this</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.260" end="00:46:46.450" style="s2">is Jordan has written extensively about</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.260" end="00:46:49.600" style="s2">this this is a core existential</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.450" end="00:46:51.910" style="s2">civilization issue and individually we</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.600" end="00:46:53.290" style="s2">take in information we process it and we</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.910" end="00:46:54.640" style="s2">act on it but where we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.290" end="00:46:56.170" style="s2">intersecting each other and we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:46:56.170" end="00:47:01.080" style="s2">be collectively taking in information</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.640" end="00:47:03.040" style="s2">right treating each other as sensors and</p>

<p begin="00:47:08.410" end="00:47:13.480" style="s2">perspectives on reality are going to be</p>

<p begin="00:47:13.480" end="00:47:17.350" style="s2">have blind spots that are unavoidable</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.070" end="00:47:20.620" style="s2">the only way you start to address them</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.350" end="00:47:22.120" style="s2">is having more perspectives and then the</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.620" end="00:47:25.270" style="s2">ability to start to integrate and</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.120" end="00:47:26.710" style="s2">synthesize those of course was saying</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.270" end="00:47:27.850" style="s2">get together and talk to people and both</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.710" end="00:47:30.400" style="s2">of them are saying get together and talk</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.850" end="00:47:32.350" style="s2">to people that one of the keys was</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.400" end="00:47:35.980" style="s2">people who have different perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.350" end="00:47:40.090" style="s2">and different data different Intel</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.980" end="00:47:43.750" style="s2">because how many people were really</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.090" end="00:47:46.240" style="s2">surprised by the Trump election who were</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.750" end="00:47:48.310" style="s2">talking to people about politics that</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.240" end="00:47:50.800" style="s2">all were in the same misinformation</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.310" end="00:47:53.440" style="s2">bubble that they were in right and</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.800" end="00:47:56.050" style="s2">because they stayed within a worldview</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.440" end="00:47:58.360" style="s2">protected in group misinformation bubble</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.050" end="00:47:59.980" style="s2">the world they thought existed in the</p>

<p begin="00:47:59.980" end="00:48:07.510" style="s2">radically different and so a couple</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.050" end="00:48:09.400" style="s2">things I would add is want to know what</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.510" end="00:48:12.850" style="s2">the world actually is rather than want</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.400" end="00:48:17.080" style="s2">to reinforce your ideas about it because</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.850" end="00:48:20.980" style="s2">if your ideas about it are off they will</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.080" end="00:48:23.800" style="s2">be maladaptive so want to get</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.980" end="00:48:26.240" style="s2">perspective that is</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.800" end="00:48:27.440" style="s2">different than and even challenging to</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.240" end="00:48:31.480" style="s2">the current way that you see things</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.440" end="00:48:33.620" style="s2">critical one step deeper than that is</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.480" end="00:48:38.000" style="s2">separate your identity from your</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.620" end="00:48:41.210" style="s2">worldview right so that your sense of</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.000" end="00:48:42.770" style="s2">security emotionally and your sense of</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.210" end="00:48:47.180" style="s2">certainty about certain facts are</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.770" end="00:48:49.700" style="s2">decoupled because to the degree that</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.180" end="00:48:51.320" style="s2">your ability to not freak out is because</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.700" end="00:48:53.030" style="s2">you&#39;re fairly sure about something you</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.320" end="00:48:54.710" style="s2">will not take alternate opinions on that</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.030" end="00:48:58.550" style="s2">alternate perspectives even if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.710" end="00:49:01.100" style="s2">wrong and so the ability to have some</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.550" end="00:49:02.810" style="s2">sense of inability to not freak out that</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.100" end="00:49:04.700" style="s2">is decoupled from being fairly certain</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.810" end="00:49:12.560" style="s2">about things is actually really</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.700" end="00:49:13.900" style="s2">important one of the conversations that</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.560" end="00:49:17.420" style="s2">I&#39;ve had with these two gentlemen</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.900" end="00:49:19.520" style="s2">particularly is that I know that when</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.420" end="00:49:22.880" style="s2">they say something that they&#39;ve thought</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.520" end="00:49:25.550" style="s2">about it carefully and so as a result I</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.880" end="00:49:27.710" style="s2">can I can put aside whatever beliefs I</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.550" end="00:49:29.900" style="s2">have and whatever reactions I might be</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.710" end="00:49:31.730" style="s2">experiencing or whatever might my ideas</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.900" end="00:49:33.890" style="s2">or thoughts or opinions might be and say</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.730" end="00:49:36.170" style="s2">okay I really want to know what this</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.890" end="00:49:38.050" style="s2">person is thinking I want to understand</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.170" end="00:49:39.890" style="s2">how they are perceiving the world</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.050" end="00:49:43.610" style="s2">because whatever it is that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.890" end="00:49:45.820" style="s2">saying it means something and and so in</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.610" end="00:49:48.530" style="s2">effect a lot of the conversations are</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.820" end="00:49:50.150" style="s2">really based upon this idea that we</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.530" end="00:49:52.880" style="s2">believe that the other person is saying</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.150" end="00:49:57.260" style="s2">something that is meaningful it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.880" end="00:50:00.440" style="s2">important so in effect we want to engage</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.260" end="00:50:02.330" style="s2">that aspect as the essence what is</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.440" end="00:50:04.790" style="s2">important ask that question what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.330" end="00:50:06.440" style="s2">important for you right now what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.790" end="00:50:08.330" style="s2">important in this conversation what is</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.440" end="00:50:10.730" style="s2">important for us to say to one another</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.330" end="00:50:12.440" style="s2">so that we each have a more</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.730" end="00:50:16.870" style="s2">comprehensive view of what reality</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.440" end="00:50:19.850" style="s2">actually is this whole thing about</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.870" end="00:50:21.950" style="s2">having opinions and perceptions and</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.850" end="00:50:23.810" style="s2">stuff like that there is a always going</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.950" end="00:50:26.000" style="s2">to be this filtering process nature in a</p>

<p begin="00:52:16.020" end="00:52:20.100" style="s2">actually a couple of blind spots so we</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.340" end="00:52:21.480" style="s2">need to know how to navigate this the</p>

<p begin="00:53:05.950" end="00:53:11.170" style="s2">design you know like let&#39;s say you have</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.890" end="00:53:12.940" style="s2">a an operating system you know it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.170" end="00:53:14.290" style="s2">very complicated piece of software and</p>

<p begin="00:53:14.290" end="00:53:16.870" style="s2">change it and you want to make sure that</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.640" end="00:53:19.030" style="s2">you actually have a computer that</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.870" end="00:53:21.130" style="s2">continues to work because you need it</p>

<p begin="00:53:21.130" end="00:53:26.080" style="s2">changes are going on it is possible to</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.060" end="00:53:28.350" style="s2">do that it&#39;s a technique called</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.080" end="00:53:30.340" style="s2">refactoring where you basically are</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.350" end="00:53:32.080" style="s2">partitioning the source code and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.340" end="00:53:33.160" style="s2">working with you know segments of it</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.080" end="00:53:35.440" style="s2">which are keeping the whole system</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.160" end="00:53:38.500" style="s2">operational and rerouting signals across</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.440" end="00:53:41.770" style="s2">the path that you&#39;re trying to fix so it</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.500" end="00:53:45.160" style="s2">is possible to do this but it takes an</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.770" end="00:53:46.750" style="s2">awful lot of skill right if you are</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.160" end="00:53:48.190" style="s2">essentially trying to recreate an</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.750" end="00:53:49.690" style="s2">operating system of course the easy way</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.190" end="00:53:51.580" style="s2">to do is to trash the old one and start</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.690" end="00:53:53.770" style="s2">from scratch and create the new one but</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.580" end="00:53:55.300" style="s2">oftentimes this isn&#39;t actually a very</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.770" end="00:53:56.230" style="s2">good idea because what happens is that</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.300" end="00:53:58.090" style="s2">it throws out the baby with the</p>

<p begin="00:54:27.580" end="00:54:32.050" style="s2">try to you know look at the picture of</p>

<p begin="00:54:45.580" end="00:54:49.300" style="s2">about those kinds of things then you can</p>

<p begin="00:54:49.300" end="00:54:52.120" style="s2">or you could start basically going</p>

<p begin="00:55:36.380" end="00:55:39.099" style="s2">well enough on force was describing how</p>

<p begin="00:55:42.770" end="00:55:48.440" style="s2">with the issues is that when we get</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.230" end="00:55:49.970" style="s2">scared and we want to go fast and we</p>

<p begin="00:55:49.970" end="00:55:54.109" style="s2">enough in addressing some of it we might</p>

<p begin="00:55:54.109" end="00:55:57.319" style="s2">problematic way and so we can see like</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.819" end="00:55:59.390" style="s2">getting scared about climate change and</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.319" end="00:56:02.030" style="s2">so we need we need to address</p>

<p begin="00:56:53.359" end="00:56:58.220" style="s2">so that&#39;s the topic of prototyping right</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.180" end="00:57:00.410" style="s2">civilization prototyping this is one of</p>

<p begin="00:57:07.579" end="00:57:11.740" style="s2">scales right and what would be the</p>

<p begin="00:57:23.050" end="00:57:28.300" style="s2">viable in in real instantiation and then</p>

<p begin="00:57:33.550" end="00:57:38.830" style="s2">also the forward engineering of how do</p>

<p begin="00:57:38.830" end="00:57:42.700" style="s2">we can make iterative shifts on that</p>

<p begin="00:57:42.700" end="00:57:47.080" style="s2">the key dynamics is move it forward</p>

<p begin="00:57:51.910" end="00:57:57.190" style="s2">iteration good I actually have a very</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.360" end="00:58:00.480" style="s2">different angle and it&#39;s what I think</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.190" end="00:58:03.220" style="s2">the experts really nice care like</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.480" end="00:58:06.820" style="s2">historically whenever we go through a</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.220" end="00:58:08.619" style="s2">major transition there are two failure</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.820" end="00:58:12.130" style="s2">conditions that leading lead to things</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.619" end="00:58:14.860" style="s2">being very bad the first has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.130" end="00:58:16.480" style="s2">the way the elites relate to the</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.860" end="00:58:18.790" style="s2">transition so think about for example</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.480" end="00:58:20.500" style="s2">the American Revolution the French</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.790" end="00:58:22.750" style="s2">Revolution and the collapse of the Roman</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.500" end="00:58:24.940" style="s2">Empire in each of those characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.750" end="00:58:27.640" style="s2">the elites related to them transition</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.940" end="00:58:30.040" style="s2">very differently in the collapse of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.640" end="00:58:32.940" style="s2">Roman Empire the elites simply refused</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.040" end="00:58:35.020" style="s2">to allow a transition to occur until the</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.940" end="00:58:37.270" style="s2">mismatch between their system and the</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.020" end="00:58:38.830" style="s2">complexity gotten so high that it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.270" end="00:58:41.830" style="s2">that go to what I would consider to be a</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.830" end="00:58:44.290" style="s2">good representation of absolute chaos we</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.830" end="00:58:47.080" style="s2">need to avoid that like a plague and so</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.290" end="00:58:48.340" style="s2">finding ways to get some portion of our</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.080" end="00:58:50.500" style="s2">elites to be able to have a</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.340" end="00:58:53.050" style="s2">consciousness of the necessity of being</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.500" end="00:58:56.440" style="s2">deliberate about change is extremely</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.050" end="00:58:58.330" style="s2">important but if you think about the</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.440" end="00:59:00.310" style="s2">American Revolution at least in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.330" end="00:59:02.619" style="s2">United States along the coast in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.310" end="00:59:03.910" style="s2">colonies a pretty sizable function of</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.619" end="00:59:06.190" style="s2">elites who we now know as the founding</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.910" end="00:59:07.390" style="s2">fathers were willing to step into and</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.190" end="00:59:10.300" style="s2">take leadership in making that change</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.390" end="00:59:11.530" style="s2">happen now the other failure condition</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.300" end="00:59:13.750" style="s2">comes from the fact at the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.530" end="00:59:16.300" style="s2">day we&#39;re all monkeys</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.750" end="00:59:17.800" style="s2">we&#39;re primates right we&#39;ve gotten pretty</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.300" end="00:59:19.480" style="s2">good at not killing each other in this</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.800" end="00:59:21.010" style="s2">room and staring and being quiet because</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.480" end="00:59:21.760" style="s2">we&#39;ve trained really hard at doing that</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.010" end="00:59:24.130" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.760" end="00:59:27.400" style="s2">as civilization starts to break down we</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.130" end="00:59:30.280" style="s2">go right back to being 8 and the way</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.400" end="00:59:32.380" style="s2">that apes don&#39;t freak out is when some</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.280" end="00:59:35.350" style="s2">of the apes seem to know what the</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.380" end="00:59:36.730" style="s2">is going on and they don&#39;t freak out all</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.350" end="00:59:37.660" style="s2">right so when things go crazy you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.730" end="00:59:39.400" style="s2">going to people you&#39;ll start looking</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.660" end="00:59:42.220" style="s2">around if I who seems to have their act</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.400" end="00:59:43.870" style="s2">together have your act together if the</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.220" end="00:59:46.270" style="s2">emergent leaders is the second piece</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.870" end="00:59:49.060" style="s2">right the people who have done the work</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.270" end="00:59:51.880" style="s2">to be able to hold fast and not panic</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.060" end="00:59:53.710" style="s2">when things begin to break apart that</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.880" end="00:59:55.480" style="s2">other people will look to and say where</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.710" end="00:59:56.950" style="s2">is the anchor what&#39;s going on here and</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.480" end="00:59:58.870" style="s2">if we have enough of those people</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.950" end="01:00:00.700" style="s2">embedded in what&#39;s happening even as</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.870" end="01:00:03.280" style="s2">things fall down they don&#39;t go to</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.700" end="01:00:05.170" style="s2">absolute chaos actually very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.280" end="01:00:07.420" style="s2">it&#39;s not an objective function we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.170" end="01:00:09.340" style="s2">seen some experiences where monetary</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.420" end="01:00:10.900" style="s2">systems have completely vaporized people</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.340" end="01:00:13.120" style="s2">have had a hard time eating there&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.900" end="01:00:15.340" style="s2">fighting didn&#39;t go to absolute chaos</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.120" end="01:00:18.070" style="s2">because something held the fabric</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.340" end="01:00:19.390" style="s2">together right people certain emergent</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.070" end="01:00:20.980" style="s2">leaders are willing to step up and say</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.390" end="01:00:22.000" style="s2">no we&#39;re still going to be civilized</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.980" end="01:00:23.890" style="s2">we&#39;re still going to hold this thing</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.000" end="01:00:26.710" style="s2">together that&#39;s the other answer to it</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.890" end="01:00:28.360" style="s2">so the architecture in the mechanics and</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.710" end="01:00:30.070" style="s2">the thinking the process all very true</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.360" end="01:00:31.090" style="s2">but at the foundation if you want to</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.070" end="01:00:33.670" style="s2">keep these molecules from tearing each</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.090" end="01:00:37.360" style="s2">other apart you know be the person you</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.670" end="01:00:40.690" style="s2">want to be simply teeing up the next</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.360" end="01:00:42.280" style="s2">question awesome Jordan so so let&#39;s get</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.690" end="01:00:44.650" style="s2">into the how of that so this next</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.280" end="01:00:46.450" style="s2">question is how can we realign</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.650" end="01:00:49.120" style="s2">everyone&#39;s sense of purpose towards the</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.450" end="01:00:51.490" style="s2">well-being of all and away from the</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.120" end="01:00:53.020" style="s2">self-interest of the market economies so</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.490" end="01:00:55.570" style="s2">that we actually wholeheartedly</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.020" end="01:00:58.060" style="s2">cooperate and even innovate with such</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.570" end="01:01:00.810" style="s2">transitions how do we get there as</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.060" end="01:01:00.810" style="s2">humans</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.350" end="01:01:13.550" style="s2">so it is necessarily iterative the</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.550" end="01:01:16.610" style="s2">answer is necessarily iterative one of</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.550" end="01:01:18.320" style="s2">the things is there&#39;s a dialectic of</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.610" end="01:01:21.410" style="s2">different things that you&#39;re hearing in</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.320" end="01:01:24.680" style="s2">the group which is hey things are more</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.410" end="01:01:26.030" style="s2">eminently collapsing then you&#39;re aware</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.680" end="01:01:26.990" style="s2">of on a day-to-day basis when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.030" end="01:01:28.610" style="s2">thinking about cleaning the house and</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.990" end="01:01:30.290" style="s2">paying the bills etc so there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.610" end="01:01:32.840" style="s2">urgency in that at the same time we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.290" end="01:01:35.660" style="s2">hearing don&#39;t react too fast with</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.840" end="01:01:39.110" style="s2">urgency and slow down what that means is</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.660" end="01:01:42.560" style="s2">a shift of attention from other less</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.110" end="01:01:44.060" style="s2">critical stuff to the topics that are</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.560" end="01:01:47.150" style="s2">actually at hand because you get that</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.060" end="01:01:49.400" style="s2">they&#39;re real I know how many people have</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.150" end="01:01:51.380" style="s2">watched the videos of Richard Fineman</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.400" end="01:01:52.640" style="s2">talking about space but one of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.380" end="01:01:54.740" style="s2">things he does is beautiful is he&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.640" end="01:01:56.810" style="s2">when you think about the vast distances</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.740" end="01:01:58.460" style="s2">of space and you think about the number</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.810" end="01:02:00.980" style="s2">of stars that we talk about like really</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.460" end="01:02:03.320" style="s2">think about and it&#39;s really there it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.980" end="01:02:05.480" style="s2">hard for us on planet to think about 400</p>

<p begin="01:02:05.480" end="01:02:09.200" style="s2">just hard it&#39;s actually impossible but</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.920" end="01:02:10.910" style="s2">to the degree that you try and then</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.200" end="01:02:16.840" style="s2">that&#39;s one tiny galaxy to the degree</p>

<p begin="01:02:57.080" end="01:03:00.200" style="s2">educate about those things and maybe we</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.910" end="01:03:02.120" style="s2">don&#39;t know exactly what the timeframes</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.200" end="01:03:04.700" style="s2">are but that this current civilization</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.120" end="01:03:07.730" style="s2">set is shifting and se-ra if I take that</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.700" end="01:03:11.090" style="s2">seriously if I really take that</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.730" end="01:03:12.590" style="s2">seriously what do I do differently well</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.090" end="01:03:13.910" style="s2">I&#39;m going to allocate more time to</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.590" end="01:03:16.520" style="s2">getting more educated I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.910" end="01:03:18.980" style="s2">develop my thinking and sense making</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.520" end="01:03:20.090" style="s2">frameworks one of the things we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.980" end="01:03:22.369" style="s2">to earlier as well we&#39;re talking to</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.090" end="01:03:23.840" style="s2">people and when for said he takes</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.369" end="01:03:24.680" style="s2">seriously when Jordan or I say something</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.840" end="01:03:26.720" style="s2">because we&#39;ve thought about it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.680" end="01:03:28.130" style="s2">mean he agrees with all of it right and</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.720" end="01:03:30.200" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t mean that he rejects all of</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.130" end="01:03:32.660" style="s2">it means he has an ability to have</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.200" end="01:03:34.190" style="s2">analytic thinking and really critical</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.660" end="01:03:35.869" style="s2">thinking in parse is this true is it not</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.190" end="01:03:37.820" style="s2">true how do we know those are skills</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.869" end="01:03:40.280" style="s2">that are developable everybody has to</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.820" end="01:03:41.510" style="s2">develop and then synthetic thinking well</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.280" end="01:03:42.890" style="s2">that seems true and it seems quite</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.510" end="01:03:45.859" style="s2">different than another truth how do</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.890" end="01:03:47.990" style="s2">those actually fit together right so the</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.859" end="01:03:49.369" style="s2">ability for analysis and synthesis</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.990" end="01:03:51.050" style="s2">there&#39;s more than that that&#39;s necessary</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.369" end="01:03:52.730" style="s2">but developing those frameworks and</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.050" end="01:03:54.800" style="s2">putting data into those frameworks and</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.730" end="01:03:57.470" style="s2">putting more time into the entire thing</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.800" end="01:04:00.800" style="s2">but so how do we develop the care right</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.470" end="01:04:03.109" style="s2">if you really think about and get that</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.800" end="01:04:05.750" style="s2">your own success and the success of your</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.109" end="01:04:07.369" style="s2">family is not insurable independent of</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.750" end="01:04:09.320" style="s2">the success of the whole if you get that</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.369" end="01:04:12.890" style="s2">that is true in the time frame of your</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.320" end="01:04:14.690" style="s2">life and your children&#39;s life and in</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.890" end="01:04:16.280" style="s2">trying to ensure their success</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.690" end="01:04:18.950" style="s2">independent of the success of the whole</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.280" end="01:04:20.090" style="s2">it will fail and if when you say that</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.950" end="01:04:24.650" style="s2">once more that&#39;s a really important</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.090" end="01:04:27.590" style="s2">point they&#39;re trying to ensure our own</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.650" end="01:04:29.540" style="s2">individual success independent of or</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.590" end="01:04:31.070" style="s2">even at the expense of the success of</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.540" end="01:04:34.400" style="s2">others of the whole is not a viable</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.070" end="01:04:35.930" style="s2">strategy and yet it was something that</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.400" end="01:04:38.270" style="s2">seemed viable for a very long time and</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.930" end="01:04:39.530" style="s2">so it&#39;s easy to kind of fall back on</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.270" end="01:04:41.869" style="s2">that intuition but to get that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.530" end="01:04:43.490" style="s2">fundamentally different time so so</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.869" end="01:04:47.170" style="s2">people can get that intellectually but</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.490" end="01:04:47.170" style="s2">how do you get them to be that</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.820" end="01:04:54.240" style="s2">I&#39;m going to give dad a time to think</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.980" end="01:04:57.600" style="s2">but throwing something out that&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.240" end="01:05:03.270" style="s2">of the conversation didn&#39;t mentioned it</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.600" end="01:05:04.560" style="s2">that this notion of win-lose was seemed</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.270" end="01:05:05.610" style="s2">like a viable strategy for a very long</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.560" end="01:05:08.940" style="s2">period of time I&#39;m actually gonna make a</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.610" end="01:05:11.750" style="s2">stronger statement that for effectively</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.940" end="01:05:15.750" style="s2">all of evolutionary history up until</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.750" end="01:05:18.270" style="s2">like a couple weeks ago it was by far</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.750" end="01:05:21.660" style="s2">the best strategy it was the absolute</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.270" end="01:05:23.040" style="s2">best strategy if you didn&#39;t do that you</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.660" end="01:05:24.750" style="s2">were going to be selected against and</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.040" end="01:05:26.460" style="s2">somebody else&#39;s children going to be the</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.750" end="01:05:27.690" style="s2">children who populated the world it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.460" end="01:05:30.360" style="s2">really important to keep that in mind</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.690" end="01:05:32.250" style="s2">like evolution really really really</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.360" end="01:05:36.720" style="s2">wants us to struggle with other things</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.250" end="01:05:38.610" style="s2">to survive but now we&#39;re in a situation</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.720" end="01:05:40.740" style="s2">where things are changing so the</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.610" end="01:05:41.880" style="s2">magnitude this changes not just in the</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.740" end="01:05:43.680" style="s2">sense that our civilization is</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.880" end="01:05:45.000" style="s2">collapsing right the other side is well</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.680" end="01:05:46.050" style="s2">number daniel mentioned it we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.000" end="01:05:48.300" style="s2">reaching a point where there&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.050" end="01:05:49.800" style="s2">be a pivot and it&#39;s not they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.300" end="01:05:52.140" style="s2">go up or down if it goes down it goes</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.800" end="01:05:53.430" style="s2">way down because up it goes way up and</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.140" end="01:05:54.690" style="s2">the people who talk about abundance</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.430" end="01:05:57.060" style="s2">aren&#39;t wrong</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.690" end="01:05:59.400" style="s2">we actually have created so much</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.060" end="01:06:01.100" style="s2">capacity that the kinds of things that</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.400" end="01:06:03.450" style="s2">we have been struggling over for</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.100" end="01:06:05.730" style="s2">hundreds of thousands of years are no</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.450" end="01:06:07.530" style="s2">longer meaningful and so for example you</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.730" end="01:06:09.000" style="s2">guys are I assume reasonably familiar</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.530" end="01:06:11.160" style="s2">with this notion of technological</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.000" end="01:06:12.510" style="s2">unemployment it&#39;s also getting a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.160" end="01:06:14.760" style="s2">press in the Bay Area in places like</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.510" end="01:06:16.710" style="s2">that that things like self-driving cars</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.760" end="01:06:18.750" style="s2">are going to unemploy 1.5 million people</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.710" end="01:06:20.040" style="s2">in the next decade and that robots are</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.750" end="01:06:22.290" style="s2">going to take everybody&#39;s jobs now if</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.040" end="01:06:24.750" style="s2">you&#39;re on the scarcity mindset that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.290" end="01:06:28.470" style="s2">very scary and being unemployed is very</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.750" end="01:06:29.460" style="s2">bad but if you flip it around what that</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.470" end="01:06:32.490" style="s2">means is that we don&#39;t actually need</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.460" end="01:06:35.220" style="s2">people to work that much anymore in fact</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.490" end="01:06:37.650" style="s2">in some sense in the next 20 years but</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.220" end="01:06:39.630" style="s2">do our things right nobody needs to work</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.650" end="01:06:40.680" style="s2">anymore and we actually have to figure</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.630" end="01:06:44.130" style="s2">out how to apply ourselves to something</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.680" end="01:06:46.140" style="s2">completely different so we&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.130" end="01:06:48.630" style="s2">process again of watching this old</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.140" end="01:06:49.740" style="s2">structure begin to fall apart and as</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.630" end="01:06:51.870" style="s2">Dana said it&#39;s going to be iterative</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.740" end="01:06:54.180" style="s2">right things like universal basic income</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.870" end="01:06:56.430" style="s2">or a nice transitionary piece and there</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.180" end="01:06:58.740" style="s2">will be other pieces as well that will</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.430" end="01:07:01.290" style="s2">begin to buffer the feeling of scarcity</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.740" end="01:07:03.570" style="s2">in a way that begins to allow people to</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.290" end="01:07:04.059" style="s2">have actual material freedom to not to</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.570" end="01:07:06.640" style="s2">have to</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.059" end="01:07:09.579" style="s2">they have to go out and fight dog and</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.640" end="01:07:12.249" style="s2">dog and each dog inside the workplace to</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.579" end="01:07:13.539" style="s2">survive and then in the mean time we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.249" end="01:07:14.799" style="s2">in the process of trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.539" end="01:07:17.529" style="s2">how to build structures that are</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.799" end="01:07:18.219" style="s2">designed for abundance which is a very</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.529" end="01:07:19.630" style="s2">different thing</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.219" end="01:07:20.739" style="s2">I mean abundance is a completely</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.630" end="01:07:22.930" style="s2">different framework of how we go about</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.739" end="01:07:25.749" style="s2">doing things by the way it&#39;s non-trivial</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.930" end="01:07:27.519" style="s2">no purpose for example is a big problem</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.749" end="01:07:30.880" style="s2">you think about it right now we have</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.519" end="01:07:34.119" style="s2">this really nice mesh where you work to</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.880" end="01:07:36.430" style="s2">survive they glue together all right if</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.119" end="01:07:37.599" style="s2">I pull that apart and I make it okay</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.430" end="01:07:39.969" style="s2">well you don&#39;t have to work and you can</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.599" end="01:07:41.769" style="s2">still survive where&#39;s purpose fit into</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.969" end="01:07:43.599" style="s2">this most people get their sense of</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.769" end="01:07:45.519" style="s2">purpose by being valuable to other</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.599" end="01:07:46.989" style="s2">people by doing their job and creating</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.519" end="01:07:47.979" style="s2">something in the world but if you&#39;re no</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.989" end="01:07:49.689" style="s2">longer working and you&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.979" end="01:07:50.920" style="s2">surviving that&#39;s actually terrible that</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.689" end="01:07:52.900" style="s2">will destroy things if you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.920" end="01:07:54.549" style="s2">some way of actually generating purpose</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.900" end="01:07:56.140" style="s2">in different mechanism so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.549" end="01:07:58.599" style="s2">problem designing post-transition</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.140" end="01:08:00.670" style="s2">designing for abundance is a spiritual</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.599" end="01:08:02.799" style="s2">it&#39;s a psychological it&#39;s an economic at</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.670" end="01:08:05.199" style="s2">the technological process it is another</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.799" end="01:08:06.789" style="s2">way of saying the new toolkit that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.199" end="01:08:08.349" style="s2">trying to build so I&#39;ll tell with</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.789" end="01:08:11.309" style="s2">someone helpful can I pick off of that</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.349" end="01:08:11.309" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.139" end="01:08:19.650" style="s2">so Georgie is the work Jordan used the</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.270" end="01:08:22.469" style="s2">word purpose and I think it was an</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.650" end="01:08:25.830" style="s2">entirely appropriate choice there is</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.469" end="01:08:29.400" style="s2">these three concepts purpose value and</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.830" end="01:08:31.920" style="s2">meaning okay and those again are three</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.400" end="01:08:34.230" style="s2">things that go together but are distinct</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.920" end="01:08:35.609" style="s2">right they are three concepts that we</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.230" end="01:08:38.549" style="s2">tend to conflate a lot when we talk</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.609" end="01:08:40.739" style="s2">about how do we create an economy we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:10:46.250" end="01:10:54.020" style="s2">is something I believe to be a necessary</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.380" end="01:10:55.910" style="s2">aspect of how to think about this Jordan</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.020" end="01:10:57.560" style="s2">mentioned phases that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.910" end="01:10:59.360" style="s2">transition that we&#39;re in and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.560" end="01:11:01.400" style="s2">urgent stuff that allows us to keep</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.360" end="01:11:03.680" style="s2">figuring stuff out there&#39;s a transition</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.400" end="01:11:05.630" style="s2">there&#39;s a post transition the transition</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.680" end="01:11:07.400" style="s2">phase is fundamentally different than</p>

<p begin="01:11:07.400" end="01:11:12.140" style="s2">is a key insight will maybe get to that</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.920" end="01:11:16.190" style="s2">more later but to answer this question</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.140" end="01:11:19.100" style="s2">of how do we increase the connectedness</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.190" end="01:11:25.880" style="s2">of the sense of self and the sense of</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.100" end="01:11:28.640" style="s2">reality and increase the care awareness</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.880" end="01:11:31.070" style="s2">etc how do we do that we said it was</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.640" end="01:11:33.950" style="s2">going to be iterative so one design</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.070" end="01:11:36.260" style="s2">criteria is that the post transition</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.950" end="01:11:40.940" style="s2">phase that actually has to be everybody</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.260" end="01:11:43.010" style="s2">and we mentioned antifragility in the</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.940" end="01:11:44.510" style="s2">presence of exponential technology we</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.010" end="01:11:47.120" style="s2">can&#39;t actually put exponential</p>

<p begin="01:11:47.120" end="01:11:50.600" style="s2">just an inexorable thing that those</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.980" end="01:11:54.410" style="s2">capacities are there now when you think</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.600" end="01:11:56.300" style="s2">about someone who you know we see goes</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.410" end="01:11:59.420" style="s2">and does a mass shooting that seemed</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.300" end="01:12:01.430" style="s2">kind of unprovoked they have the access</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.420" end="01:12:03.200" style="s2">to a gun and especially say an automatic</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.430" end="01:12:04.940" style="s2">gun they can do more damage in that</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.200" end="01:12:08.780" style="s2">process than if they had the access to</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.940" end="01:12:10.880" style="s2">just a knife right and so now as we take</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.780" end="01:12:12.710" style="s2">exponential technology where you think</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.880" end="01:12:14.750" style="s2">about the first really catastrophic</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.710" end="01:12:16.250" style="s2">technologies we had very few people</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.750" end="01:12:19.480" style="s2">could have access to like nuclear</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.250" end="01:12:25.790" style="s2">weapons as you move into decentralized</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.480" end="01:12:27.440" style="s2">exponential tech and we&#39;re very small</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.790" end="01:12:29.960" style="s2">numbers of people can have really</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.440" end="01:12:32.000" style="s2">catastrophic actions the Omni</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.960" end="01:12:33.470" style="s2">consideration and choice making has to</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.000" end="01:12:34.910" style="s2">be universal not just some people</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.470" end="01:12:36.500" style="s2">because there&#39;s no longer ruling class</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.910" end="01:12:37.619" style="s2">that then has all the power and everyone</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.500" end="01:12:40.440" style="s2">else who doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.619" end="01:12:42.239" style="s2">and so that&#39;s part of the post</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.440" end="01:12:44.369" style="s2">transition design criteria and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.239" end="01:12:47.670" style="s2">really deep big deal criteria to think</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.369" end="01:12:49.080" style="s2">about so for instance most the time that</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.670" end="01:12:51.060" style="s2">person who goes into the mass shooting</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.080" end="01:12:52.440" style="s2">the neighbors say we didn&#39;t really know</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.060" end="01:12:54.000" style="s2">them right they were quiet they had</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.440" end="01:12:55.770" style="s2">themselves they were a shut-in and so</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.000" end="01:12:57.869" style="s2">they could be developing in their</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.770" end="01:13:00.330" style="s2">loneliness in their psychopathology with</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.869" end="01:13:02.849" style="s2">nobody noticing it that doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.330" end="01:13:05.340" style="s2">right in the future so how do we move</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.849" end="01:13:08.130" style="s2">too connected enough civilizations that</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.340" end="01:13:09.420" style="s2">everyone is is actually connected to</p>

<p begin="01:13:14.540" end="01:13:19.469" style="s2">everyone Romney considered as part of</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.219" end="01:13:21.869" style="s2">post transition it doesn&#39;t take everyone</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.469" end="01:13:25.080" style="s2">for us to get there right this is the</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.869" end="01:13:27.840" style="s2">iterative it takes some people building</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.080" end="01:13:30.960" style="s2">capacities that start to change game</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.840" end="01:13:33.420" style="s2">theory dynamics it&#39;s so you know the</p>

<p begin="01:13:43.679" end="01:13:46.770" style="s2">beings right it might doesn&#39;t even mean</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.360" end="01:13:48.630" style="s2">that they actually feel okay with it it</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.770" end="01:13:50.400" style="s2">means that there&#39;s a game theory that</p>

<p begin="01:14:02.250" end="01:14:10.050" style="s2">everyone get there No so how do we have</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.320" end="01:14:12.389" style="s2">small groups that start to coalesce and</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.050" end="01:14:15.750" style="s2">work on changing those things that</p>

<p begin="01:14:18.179" end="01:14:23.130" style="s2">like I like education like economics</p>

<p begin="01:14:24.659" end="01:14:29.849" style="s2">at first so we&#39;ve got some really juicy</p>

<p begin="01:14:29.849" end="01:14:36.119" style="s2">and about 25 minutes the rapid-fire</p>

<p begin="01:14:36.119" end="01:14:41.429" style="s2">to do for this final round I want all I</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.630" end="01:14:43.230" style="s2">want you to really tune in if this is</p>

<p begin="01:16:08.830" end="01:16:12.070" style="s2">that sucks anyway it doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.180" end="01:16:14.170" style="s2">anymore let me be an experimenting on</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.070" end="01:16:17.140" style="s2">the ground without things blowing up</p>

<p begin="01:16:41.980" end="01:16:44.170" style="s2">different story and has all kind of</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.060" end="01:16:46.120" style="s2">different rate dynamics I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.170" end="01:16:47.500" style="s2">exactly how it plays out there that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.120" end="01:16:51.070" style="s2">decent framework though so if you can</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.500" end="01:16:53.800" style="s2">imagine scaling this - how many people</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.070" end="01:16:56.050" style="s2">here about 300 so scaling this by two</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.800" end="01:16:57.880" style="s2">orders of magnitude three doors of</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.050" end="01:16:59.710" style="s2">magnitude that&#39;s probably the right kind</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.880" end="01:17:02.170" style="s2">of framework to be able to maneuver us</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.710" end="01:17:04.300" style="s2">across a transition the other big piece</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.170" end="01:17:06.280" style="s2">that would be fantastic as I mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.300" end="01:17:08.650" style="s2">we could get a critical mass of Ely in</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.280" end="01:17:10.360" style="s2">the next two or three years that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.650" end="01:17:11.320" style="s2">things get very sketchy we don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.360" end="01:17:13.210" style="s2">lot of time for that we need to get a</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.320" end="01:17:14.980" style="s2">critical mass of elites to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.210" end="01:17:18.579" style="s2">actually be willing to take the risk</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.980" end="01:17:20.170" style="s2">that the games a one is going away and</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.579" end="01:17:22.599" style="s2">they&#39;re going to be the folks who are</p>

<p begin="01:17:22.599" end="01:17:27.610" style="s2">might be able to do without that but</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.219" end="01:17:29.349" style="s2">probably not I have a quick one so in</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.610" end="01:17:31.090" style="s2">the intermediate transition phase</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.349" end="01:17:34.179" style="s2">imagine the world that basically doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.090" end="01:17:36.280" style="s2">have any intellectual property taxes and</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.179" end="01:17:38.530" style="s2">then for the long game imagine a world</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.280" end="01:17:41.590" style="s2">where everybody understood the full</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.530" end="01:17:45.010" style="s2">meaning of this simple idea love is that</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.590" end="01:17:47.559" style="s2">which enables choice you really get that</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.010" end="01:17:49.510" style="s2">if you really really get that if you</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.559" end="01:17:52.210" style="s2">live by that principle if everybody in</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.510" end="01:17:54.400" style="s2">the world understood that thoroughly the</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.210" end="01:17:57.880" style="s2">world would and would absolutely be a</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.400" end="01:18:00.340" style="s2">better place as cliche as it is teeing</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.880" end="01:18:03.630" style="s2">up the next question you talk about</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.340" end="01:18:06.730" style="s2">forming a collective that&#39;s aligned in</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.630" end="01:18:10.690" style="s2">feeling deeply interconnected what is</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.730" end="01:18:14.739" style="s2">the toolbox to keep us accountable to</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.690" end="01:18:16.480" style="s2">that state specific actions we could all</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.739" end="01:18:19.559" style="s2">be doing to keep ourselves accountable</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.480" end="01:18:21.820" style="s2">to really living in that state of</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.559" end="01:18:24.610" style="s2">interconnectivity what it is whatever</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.820" end="01:18:26.679" style="s2">you want to call it so we have this idea</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.610" end="01:18:28.540" style="s2">that we want to maintain a particular</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.679" end="01:18:30.280" style="s2">condition and there was a question that</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.540" end="01:18:31.960" style="s2">was asked about you know who&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.280" end="01:18:33.520" style="s2">be the enforcers of the loss who&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.960" end="01:18:35.020" style="s2">to make the loss and this question</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.520" end="01:18:37.000" style="s2">strikes me of being very similar in some</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.020" end="01:18:39.460" style="s2">respects how do we maintain an integrity</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.000" end="01:18:41.050" style="s2">state we can&#39;t do it by having a special</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.460" end="01:18:43.659" style="s2">class of people that is essentially the</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.050" end="01:18:44.949" style="s2">enforcers the police you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.659" end="01:18:46.329" style="s2">just another version of the Stanford</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.949" end="01:18:49.360" style="s2">Prison Experiment and though it moves</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.329" end="01:18:50.980" style="s2">very slowly it ends up very ugly and you</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.360" end="01:18:52.480" style="s2">can&#39;t do it by basically trying to have</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.980" end="01:18:54.119" style="s2">everybody become the policeman and</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.480" end="01:18:56.020" style="s2">watching everyone else that basically</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.119" end="01:18:57.730" style="s2">erodes what there&#39;s a sense of</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.020" end="01:18:59.980" style="s2">individual sovereignty and privacy it</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.730" end="01:19:03.099" style="s2">makes you essentially subject to the</p>

<p begin="01:19:03.099" end="01:19:06.340" style="s2">you end up not being able to do anything</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.290" end="01:19:07.389" style="s2">at all because there&#39;s always going to</p>

<p begin="01:19:07.389" end="01:19:11.020" style="s2">disagree with the basic premise of what</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.590" end="01:19:12.460" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about so in effect we</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.020" end="01:19:14.139" style="s2">need a third model we need something</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.460" end="01:19:15.880" style="s2">that is neither you know the sort of</p>

<p begin="01:19:33.980" end="01:19:38.480" style="s2">to mind for me is is sort of this</p>

<p begin="01:19:38.480" end="01:19:42.920" style="s2">can set up that we add you have a</p>

<p begin="01:20:51.920" end="01:20:56.000" style="s2">next question was asked is it was</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.210" end="01:20:58.700" style="s2">something that we all face in putting</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.000" end="01:21:01.250" style="s2">this event on is gaining a holistic</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.700" end="01:21:03.560" style="s2">perspective we&#39;ve talked about the</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.250" end="01:21:05.660" style="s2">importance of diversity we&#39;ve talked</p>

<p begin="01:21:08.360" end="01:21:14.810" style="s2">through and yet here we sit right is for</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.240" end="01:21:16.880" style="s2">white men and so how do we gain that</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.810" end="01:21:20.810" style="s2">holistic perspective how do we continue</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.880" end="01:21:24.250" style="s2">to really encourage diversity and ensure</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.810" end="01:21:27.929" style="s2">diversity as we&#39;re building this new</p>

<p begin="01:21:27.929" end="01:21:31.380" style="s2">I think I want to make one correction</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.310" end="01:21:33.570" style="s2">it&#39;s not just that it&#39;s diversity it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.380" end="01:21:36.150" style="s2">that it&#39;s integration right if we just</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.570" end="01:21:37.650" style="s2">have everything the same you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.150" end="01:21:39.239" style="s2">enough integration there&#39;s not enough</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.650" end="01:21:41.310" style="s2">variation in the system and if you have</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.239" end="01:21:43.080" style="s2">just an emphasis on diversity then you</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.310" end="01:21:45.030" style="s2">end up with so many different points of</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.080" end="01:21:47.070" style="s2">view but no integration that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.030" end="01:21:48.719" style="s2">work either you want to have something</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.070" end="01:21:51.630" style="s2">which is essentially an integration of</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.719" end="01:21:54.150" style="s2">enough diversity that essentially you</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.630" end="01:21:55.530" style="s2">have really encountered reality if</p>

<p begin="01:21:55.530" end="01:21:58.260" style="s2">only understand part of what the problem</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.849" end="01:22:00.179" style="s2">is because you&#39;ve only exposed yourself</p>

<p begin="01:22:07.139" end="01:22:10.500" style="s2">part of it is is it by embracing</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.820" end="01:22:14.099" style="s2">diversity by embracing other points of</p>

<p begin="01:22:18.989" end="01:22:24.960" style="s2">individuals but when we have the insight</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.070" end="01:22:27.420" style="s2">we can grasp that feeling and turn it</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.960" end="01:22:28.800" style="s2">into a form we can write down the answer</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.420" end="01:22:30.960" style="s2">because we know the language of the</p>

<p begin="01:23:07.860" end="01:23:11.340" style="s2">basically see from enough perspective so</p>

<p begin="01:23:27.960" end="01:23:34.050" style="s2">and multiple valleys so as nature&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.139" end="01:23:36.570" style="s2">evolving and we see increased orderly</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.050" end="01:23:37.610" style="s2">complexity and kind of a movement of new</p>

<p begin="01:23:39.380" end="01:23:44.120" style="s2">at the end of that chain so far</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.540" end="01:23:45.530" style="s2">viruses are still evolving to right</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.120" end="01:23:46.790" style="s2">corals are still evolving to there&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="01:23:46.790" end="01:23:50.750" style="s2">adaptive and then there&#39;s some things</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.170" end="01:23:52.340" style="s2">that are not adaptive the same is going</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.750" end="01:23:54.140" style="s2">to be true in the future of civilization</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.340" end="01:23:56.240" style="s2">it&#39;s not going to be a homogeneous here</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.140" end="01:23:57.830" style="s2">is the worldview or here is the</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.240" end="01:23:59.540" style="s2">aesthetic that everyone has there will</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.830" end="01:24:01.790" style="s2">be an adaptive landscape of a number of</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.540" end="01:24:04.490" style="s2">ways of being a number of aesthetics a</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.790" end="01:24:06.770" style="s2">number of ways of thinking about things</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.490" end="01:24:08.420" style="s2">in problem-solving that are all adaptive</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.770" end="01:24:09.920" style="s2">that are all functional that all meet</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.420" end="01:24:12.170" style="s2">the necessary and sufficient criteria</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.920" end="01:24:15.680" style="s2">for a civilization that&#39;s viable and</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.170" end="01:24:17.410" style="s2">that means that there can be meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.680" end="01:24:23.390" style="s2">relationship across them right not just</p>

<p begin="01:24:23.390" end="01:24:27.380" style="s2">between them so it&#39;s like do we want</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.500" end="01:24:29.390" style="s2">diversity well some the kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.380" end="01:24:31.700" style="s2">diversity that lead to inexorable</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.390" end="01:24:34.730" style="s2">breakdown in conflict we don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.700" end="01:24:36.470" style="s2">right but there&#39;s a truth part in those</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.730" end="01:24:37.760" style="s2">elements that we need to be able to hold</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.470" end="01:24:39.530" style="s2">the kinds of diversity that lead to</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.760" end="01:24:41.470" style="s2">multiple perspectives that lead to</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.530" end="01:24:44.000" style="s2">synergy and emergence is critical so</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.470" end="01:24:46.580" style="s2">synergy across a bunch of the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.000" end="01:24:48.050" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really have it all right synergy</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.580" end="01:24:50.960" style="s2">across homogeny you don&#39;t get very much</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.050" end="01:24:55.220" style="s2">emergent property so this is it you know</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.960" end="01:24:59.960" style="s2">this is a key dynamic one thing I would</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.220" end="01:25:02.630" style="s2">say about it is so how do we seek out</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.960" end="01:25:04.370" style="s2">different perspectives we have a friend</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.630" end="01:25:06.620" style="s2">who just did his PhD dissertation on</p>

<p begin="01:25:10.460" end="01:25:16.190" style="s2">what does it mean higher stage and yet</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.010" end="01:25:18.050" style="s2">development isn&#39;t nothing right and one</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.190" end="01:25:19.370" style="s2">of the key things that he identified was</p>

<p begin="01:25:21.770" end="01:25:26.750" style="s2">perspective taking the ability to take</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.020" end="01:25:29.810" style="s2">multiple perspectives was less relevant</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.750" end="01:25:32.270" style="s2">than perspective seeking the ability the</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.810" end="01:25:33.800" style="s2">the predisposition to seek lots of</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.270" end="01:25:35.210" style="s2">perspectives and then the capacity to</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.800" end="01:25:37.790" style="s2">actually do it well and then the ability</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.210" end="01:25:39.740" style="s2">to synthesize across those but the most</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.790" end="01:25:42.470" style="s2">critical part that they identified was</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.740" end="01:25:45.710" style="s2">the impetus to actually seek other</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.470" end="01:25:47.360" style="s2">perspective so this is important one</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.710" end="01:25:49.720" style="s2">thing else I&#39;ll say about it is it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:25:50.030" end="01:25:55.980" style="s2">notice how many times has happened for</p>

<p begin="01:26:16.739" end="01:26:22.860" style="s2">what how do I deal with this so one</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.210" end="01:26:25.620" style="s2">thing I would say is to just actually</p>

<p begin="01:26:25.620" end="01:26:29.730" style="s2">as a part of it actually take it back</p>

<p begin="01:26:42.960" end="01:26:47.370" style="s2">Placido know something there&#39;s no aspect</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.719" end="01:26:49.800" style="s2">of those values which necessarily are</p>

<p begin="01:26:49.800" end="01:26:54.330" style="s2">and try it out</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.580" end="01:26:57.780" style="s2">you&#39;ll recall Daniel you mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.330" end="01:27:00.410" style="s2">emergence and you&#39;re often sharing that</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.780" end="01:27:04.920" style="s2">principle and so the question is can we</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.410" end="01:27:07.010" style="s2">rely on emergence can we do the work</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.920" end="01:27:10.590" style="s2">individually to be available for</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.010" end="01:27:13.020" style="s2">emergence to happen and if we do that</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.590" end="01:27:14.730" style="s2">will that allow things to transition</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.020" end="01:27:16.110" style="s2">smooth and fast enough or is there</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.730" end="01:27:20.070" style="s2">something we need to be doing in</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.110" end="01:27:25.310" style="s2">addition to that to bring about this new</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.070" end="01:27:25.310" style="s2">civilization that&#39;s actually a formality</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.600" end="01:27:32.590" style="s2">perfect</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.669" end="01:27:34.649" style="s2">right I&#39;m serious I need to actually</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.590" end="01:27:37.809" style="s2">think about that I think that we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.649" end="01:27:40.360" style="s2">we can&#39;t rely on the notion of emergence</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.809" end="01:27:41.709" style="s2">I think that if we try to rely on the</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.360" end="01:27:45.189" style="s2">notion of emergence that we are in</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.709" end="01:27:47.320" style="s2">effect you know having a kind of false</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.189" end="01:27:49.300" style="s2">hope we have to work to create that kind</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.320" end="01:27:50.860" style="s2">of awareness because there&#39;s there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.300" end="01:27:51.309" style="s2">effort that&#39;s involved between here and</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.860" end="01:27:53.800" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.309" end="01:27:56.050" style="s2">I think that a virgin&#39;s will actually</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.800" end="01:27:59.489" style="s2">happen but I think there will only</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.050" end="01:27:59.489" style="s2">happen if we don&#39;t take it for granted</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.709" end="01:28:08.409" style="s2">exactly the same end result which is</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.880" end="01:28:10.959" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s actually the question is</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.409" end="01:28:11.679" style="s2">not well formed that&#39;s not the way to</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.959" end="01:28:13.239" style="s2">think about it</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.679" end="01:28:15.070" style="s2">the way to think about it is to tune</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.239" end="01:28:18.249" style="s2">into who you are and what you&#39;re here to</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.070" end="01:28:20.110" style="s2">do and do that completely and if</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.249" end="01:28:21.999" style="s2">everybody did that do you think that</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.110" end="01:28:27.189" style="s2">would be enough to guide us through this</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.999" end="01:28:30.479" style="s2">transition it doesn&#39;t matter yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.189" end="01:28:30.479" style="s2">think that&#39;s agree with Jordan on this</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.659" end="01:28:37.809" style="s2">is it is it going to be enough to get to</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.550" end="01:28:40.329" style="s2">the transition is an unanswerable</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.809" end="01:28:42.070" style="s2">question for anyone right now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.329" end="01:28:43.630" style="s2">trying really hard to just identify the</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.070" end="01:28:45.309" style="s2">concepts that we think might be the</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.630" end="01:28:47.530" style="s2">attributes of what a solution might look</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.309" end="01:28:49.539" style="s2">like what characteristic does a solution</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.530" end="01:28:51.219" style="s2">need to have that list that this</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.539" end="01:28:52.389" style="s2">particular point is unbounded we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.219" end="01:28:53.800" style="s2">know whether everything on it is</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.389" end="01:28:56.050" style="s2">necessary I don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.800" end="01:28:57.579" style="s2">sufficient we know it&#39;s important to ask</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.050" end="01:29:00.130" style="s2">the question of what sort of</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.579" end="01:29:03.039" style="s2">characteristics are so what sort of</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.130" end="01:29:04.300" style="s2">things do we need to develop you know I</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.039" end="01:29:06.840" style="s2">think you&#39;re right Jordan is the</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.300" end="01:29:09.459" style="s2">question to some extent is not well for</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.840" end="01:29:12.300" style="s2">but it&#39;s interesting I will spend some</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.459" end="01:29:12.300" style="s2">more time thank you bye</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.830" end="01:29:18.290" style="s2">which knowing forests means you will</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.230" end="01:29:19.790" style="s2">write a definitive essay on in the next</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.290" end="01:29:21.590" style="s2">48 hours in an email</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.790" end="01:29:31.760" style="s2">that&#39;s the three people will ignore it I</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.590" end="01:29:35.330" style="s2">hope which is so getting into</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.760" end="01:29:38.440" style="s2">really practical daily ritual what would</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.330" end="01:29:42.650" style="s2">you recommend as a daily ritual practice</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.440" end="01:29:47.500" style="s2">for healing and the self work necessary</p>

<p begin="01:29:47.500" end="01:29:51.380" style="s2">meditation is important if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.120" end="01:29:53.630" style="s2">spend a little bit of time by yourself</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.380" end="01:29:56.090" style="s2">getting to know who you are if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.630" end="01:29:58.820" style="s2">spend some time basically learning what</p>

<p begin="01:29:58.820" end="01:30:02.090" style="s2">know you got to spend at least a little</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.530" end="01:30:04.600" style="s2">bit of time to yourself every day</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.090" end="01:30:08.180" style="s2">usually first thing in the morning if</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.600" end="01:30:10.550" style="s2">you if you&#39;ve become truly self aware if</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.180" end="01:30:13.400" style="s2">you know the influence that people have</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.550" end="01:30:16.640" style="s2">on you because you know who you are in</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.400" end="01:30:18.080" style="s2">the absence of all influence then you</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.640" end="01:30:21.260" style="s2">can begin to account for the effect that</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.080" end="01:30:22.490" style="s2">you have on other people which is layer</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.260" end="01:30:27.230" style="s2">in the other side of that which is</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.490" end="01:30:28.910" style="s2">friends friends are hard like friends if</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.230" end="01:30:31.070" style="s2">you have not yet figured out how to</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.910" end="01:30:33.110" style="s2">actually have friends that&#39;s the next</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.070" end="01:30:34.190" style="s2">thing and if you have by the way there</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.110" end="01:30:36.140" style="s2">are a lot of people who haven&#39;t figured</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.190" end="01:30:37.070" style="s2">that out and we most people just play</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.140" end="01:30:38.690" style="s2">next to each other</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.070" end="01:30:40.550" style="s2">nobody knows people very people know how</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.690" end="01:30:42.260" style="s2">to play with each other seriously like</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.550" end="01:30:44.120" style="s2">holding people to the standard of doing</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.260" end="01:30:44.960" style="s2">with what he just said right holding</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.120" end="01:30:47.780" style="s2">this was the standard of it absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.960" end="01:30:49.550" style="s2">not holding back from being exactly who</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.780" end="01:30:52.250" style="s2">they&#39;re supposed to be is what a friend</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.550" end="01:30:53.960" style="s2">supposed to do that is hard so if you do</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.250" end="01:30:55.070" style="s2">this and you do that I think you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.960" end="01:31:02.210" style="s2">about as good an answer you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.070" end="01:31:05.720" style="s2">get probably when Jordan said on the</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.210" end="01:31:07.520" style="s2">last question work on becoming who you</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.720" end="01:31:09.950" style="s2">are here to be an offering doing what is</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.520" end="01:31:13.220" style="s2">yours to do and that&#39;s really it that is</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.950" end="01:31:15.350" style="s2">all of you right it is not purely in</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.220" end="01:31:17.660" style="s2">elective element or heart development or</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.350" end="01:31:19.840" style="s2">will developments or personal or</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.660" end="01:31:22.070" style="s2">interpersonal it&#39;s all those things and</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.840" end="01:31:26.360" style="s2">emergence happens at the intersection of</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.070" end="01:31:29.060" style="s2">all those happening right so if is it</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.360" end="01:31:31.280" style="s2">relevant to work through childhood</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.060" end="01:31:32.780" style="s2">traumas that make us shut down or not</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.280" end="01:31:33.980" style="s2">willing to face certain things or create</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.780" end="01:31:35.389" style="s2">certain kinds of emotional</p>

<p begin="01:31:37.730" end="01:31:41.780" style="s2">sufficient no is it necessary to develop</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.429" end="01:31:44.119" style="s2">our critical thinking so we can actually</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.780" end="01:31:47.210" style="s2">see is this fact of fact or not yes is</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.119" end="01:31:49.489" style="s2">it sufficient no so if you think about</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.210" end="01:31:51.440" style="s2">whatever system if you talk about left</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.489" end="01:31:53.920" style="s2">and right brain or mind heart and whale</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.440" end="01:31:58.159" style="s2">or all the chakras all the systems of</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.920" end="01:32:00.260" style="s2">intelligence and capacity that any</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.159" end="01:32:02.600" style="s2">system that looked at what the human</p>

<p begin="01:32:02.600" end="01:32:06.530" style="s2">more developed and then not just the</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.550" end="01:32:08.389" style="s2">person with the person with other people</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.530" end="01:32:10.610" style="s2">in the environment when you can operate</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.389" end="01:32:12.800" style="s2">as a true whole integrated human being</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.610" end="01:32:16.730" style="s2">then you can be available to meet in</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.800" end="01:32:18.650" style="s2">community so perhaps this next question</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.730" end="01:32:22.100" style="s2">will take us a little deeper on this</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.650" end="01:32:24.739" style="s2">topic what are the rate limiters that</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.100" end="01:32:26.920" style="s2">are unnecessarily slowing down our</p>

<p begin="01:32:26.920" end="01:32:32.420" style="s2">interconnected to all life and how do we</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.869" end="01:32:36.340" style="s2">remove these rate limiters so that we</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.420" end="01:32:36.340" style="s2">quicken humanity&#39;s evolution</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.340" end="01:32:43.690" style="s2">I think there&#39;s an awful lot of</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.770" end="01:32:47.170" style="s2">fragmentation in our communication</p>

<p begin="01:32:51.429" end="01:32:58.659" style="s2">and all the rest they they encourage us</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.409" end="01:33:00.340" style="s2">to say shorter things and we don&#39;t get a</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.659" end="01:33:03.550" style="s2">chance to sort of sink into what</p>

<p begin="01:33:49.599" end="01:33:53.809" style="s2">fabricating an identity that worked</p>

<p begin="01:33:53.809" end="01:33:58.940" style="s2">school to be able to allow us to endure</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.510" end="01:34:00.230" style="s2">and survive the perhaps of the crisis</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.940" end="01:34:03.769" style="s2">that is reality that we live in right</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.230" end="01:34:05.059" style="s2">now and of course what that does is that</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.769" end="01:34:07.249" style="s2">means you don&#39;t engage in a lot of stuff</p>

<p begin="01:34:12.139" end="01:34:17.989" style="s2">inhibits thinking and it reacts to</p>

<p begin="01:34:34.880" end="01:34:42.769" style="s2">you and that is what is your big bet I</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.440" end="01:34:45.289" style="s2">know you&#39;ve formed a think tank called</p>

<p begin="01:34:50.210" end="01:35:06.679" style="s2">the biggest leverages do you want to do</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.860" end="01:35:12.170" style="s2">functional groups oh god no I think that</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.679" end="01:35:14.570" style="s2">for my own part I&#39;m basically having the</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.170" end="01:35:17.300" style="s2">hypothesis that there is a theory of</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.570" end="01:35:20.749" style="s2">ethics that will allow us to close the</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.300" end="01:35:24.739" style="s2">ethical gap that will allow us to move</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.749" end="01:35:27.559" style="s2">from consideration of choice effective</p>
<p begin="01:35:24.739" end="01:35:29.389" style="s2">choice good choices which is heretofore</p>
<p begin="01:35:27.559" end="01:35:32.300" style="s2">been based purely on the notion of</p>
<p begin="01:35:29.389" end="01:35:34.610" style="s2">opinion to something which has a</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.300" end="01:35:37.820" style="s2">rigorous more mathematical character</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.610" end="01:35:39.980" style="s2">which isn&#39;t to say that I&#39;m expecting</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.820" end="01:35:42.949" style="s2">that choices be made only on the basis</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.980" end="01:35:44.809" style="s2">of some intellectual premise but that by</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.949" end="01:35:47.389" style="s2">combining the hearts and the value</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.809" end="01:35:49.369" style="s2">systems that we have with a toolkit that</p>
<p begin="01:35:47.389" end="01:35:52.789" style="s2">allows us to integrate those things in a</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.369" end="01:35:54.330" style="s2">sane way that we can move the dialogue</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.789" end="01:35:56.520" style="s2">to a position that</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.330" end="01:35:58.290" style="s2">is considerably deeper than could be</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.520" end="01:36:01.290" style="s2">reached by just simply any single point</p>
<p begin="01:35:58.290" end="01:36:04.170" style="s2">of view so in effect I guess you could</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.290" end="01:36:06.150" style="s2">say that for me the big bet is whether</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.170" end="01:36:07.590" style="s2">or not that ethical system is truly</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.150" end="01:36:10.470" style="s2">complete and actually works</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.590" end="01:36:13.470" style="s2">I have subjected it to every single test</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.470" end="01:36:15.870" style="s2">I can think of I have tried it in my own</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.470" end="01:36:18.930" style="s2">business I have tried it in many years</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.870" end="01:36:21.960" style="s2">since I have come where become aware of</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.930" end="01:36:26.250" style="s2">these concepts and my hope is is that</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.960" end="01:36:28.320" style="s2">that is a component a kind of piece of</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.250" end="01:36:29.700" style="s2">architecture that that will actually</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.320" end="01:36:33.560" style="s2">work that will hold the weight that is</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.700" end="01:36:33.560" style="s2">it is in the sense to be placed on it</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.619" end="01:36:48.750" style="s2">so I could say something like my big bet</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.010" end="01:36:52.409" style="s2">is transforming macroeconomics and the</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.750" end="01:36:54.840" style="s2">because economics can be seen as an</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.409" end="01:36:57.179" style="s2">interface layer between our worldview</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.840" end="01:36:59.010" style="s2">and infrastructure right our worldview</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.179" end="01:37:02.159" style="s2">involves things like what do we value</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.010" end="01:37:03.690" style="s2">and who are we and what who is other and</p>
<p begin="01:37:02.159" end="01:37:07.080" style="s2">who are what are we connected to and</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.690" end="01:37:09.030" style="s2">then that&#39;s actually codified in an</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.080" end="01:37:10.530" style="s2">economic equation where the whale is</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.030" end="01:37:12.780" style="s2">worth something that and not something</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.530" end="01:37:14.040" style="s2">alive and where oxygen is not worth that</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.780" end="01:37:15.510" style="s2">much because there&#39;s lots of it and</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.040" end="01:37:17.070" style="s2">scare stuff is worth a lot even if we</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.510" end="01:37:19.860" style="s2">don&#39;t do anything with it right the the</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.070" end="01:37:21.960" style="s2">value equation that then predisposes</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.860" end="01:37:23.489" style="s2">what we confer resource to if you do</p>
<p begin="01:37:21.960" end="01:37:25.770" style="s2">these things will confer more resource</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.489" end="01:37:27.449" style="s2">so we confer power that way which then</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.770" end="01:37:28.949" style="s2">ends up determining which technologies</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.449" end="01:37:31.139" style="s2">get built which is where the physical</p>
<p begin="01:37:28.949" end="01:37:33.600" style="s2">power and the Darwinian senses and how</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.139" end="01:37:36.659" style="s2">the how the actual planet and each other</p>
<p begin="01:37:33.600" end="01:37:39.000" style="s2">are affected we could say that interface</p>

<p begin="01:37:41.400" end="01:37:46.949" style="s2">we could talk about a few processes to</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.290" end="01:37:49.679" style="s2">do that we could talk about a real-time</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.949" end="01:37:52.139" style="s2">balance sheet of the Commons where we</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.679" end="01:37:54.719" style="s2">have sensor grid an Internet of Things</p>

<p begin="01:38:03.389" end="01:38:06.989" style="s2">rather than have separate balance sheets</p>
<p begin="01:38:05.130" end="01:38:09.239" style="s2">that are competing at the expense of</p>

<p begin="01:39:25.480" end="01:39:31.900" style="s2">are there are theorists that say really</p>
<p begin="01:39:28.930" end="01:39:33.130" style="s2">worldview is the main thing and if we</p>

<p begin="01:39:37.120" end="01:39:41.290" style="s2">change everything there theorists who</p>
<p begin="01:39:39.160" end="01:39:43.480" style="s2">like cultural materialism say actually</p>

<p begin="01:39:48.190" end="01:39:52.330" style="s2">well actually that series of social</p>

<p begin="01:40:09.070" end="01:40:15.250" style="s2">putting my bet on is a minimum necessary</p>
