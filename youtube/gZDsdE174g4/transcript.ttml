<p begin="00:00:05.410" end="00:00:10.190" style="s2">hey guys this is a short intro to a</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.960" end="00:00:13.100" style="s2">series that we&#39;re putting out about</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.190" end="00:00:14.209" style="s2">psychedelics and it&#39;s just so happen</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.100" end="00:00:15.799" style="s2">that we&#39;ve ended up with about three</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.209" end="00:00:18.710" style="s2">pieces at the same time around the same</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.799" end="00:00:20.390" style="s2">topic and this we just want to do a</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.710" end="00:00:22.490" style="s2">little bit of an intro to it I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.390" end="00:00:23.990" style="s2">it&#39;s also interesting to link</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.490" end="00:00:25.400" style="s2">psychedelics to what we&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.990" end="00:00:26.869" style="s2">on the channel before because I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.400" end="00:00:29.749" style="s2">the link is maybe not immediately</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.869" end="00:00:32.390" style="s2">obvious but a lot of the people we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.749" end="00:00:34.370" style="s2">had on have talked about the crisis in</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.390" end="00:00:36.680" style="s2">meaning so the meaning crisis which you</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.370" end="00:00:39.050" style="s2">could see as a kind of meta crisis that</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.680" end="00:00:41.240" style="s2">is influencing all aspects of our lives</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.050" end="00:00:42.740" style="s2">and a big part of the meaning crisis as</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.240" end="00:00:44.810" style="s2">well is the crisis how do we make sense</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.740" end="00:00:45.980" style="s2">of the world how do we find truth how do</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.810" end="00:00:48.950" style="s2">we communicate with each other how do we</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.980" end="00:00:50.570" style="s2">trust each other psychedelics are really</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.950" end="00:00:54.160" style="s2">important I think because they can break</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.570" end="00:00:56.540" style="s2">people out of fixed small tunnelled</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.160" end="00:00:58.520" style="s2">cognitive traps one of the reasons are</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.540" end="00:01:00.530" style="s2">so good therapeutically and they can</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.520" end="00:01:03.110" style="s2">help us to step back from our own</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.530" end="00:01:05.180" style="s2">ideology and have that space and to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.110" end="00:01:06.650" style="s2">able to think more flexibly if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.180" end="00:01:07.939" style="s2">used correctly and they&#39;re not always</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.650" end="00:01:10.609" style="s2">used correctly but they have that</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.939" end="00:01:13.159" style="s2">potential genuinely to break us out of</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.609" end="00:01:15.829" style="s2">these tribal eyes ideological camps that</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.159" end="00:01:17.240" style="s2">we&#39;re in now where we can&#39;t talk to each</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.829" end="00:01:19.310" style="s2">other there&#39;s no good faith conversation</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.240" end="00:01:22.880" style="s2">we&#39;re not meeting each other fully from</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.310" end="00:01:24.280" style="s2">a place of genuine interest and you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.880" end="00:01:26.630" style="s2">trying to get somewhere together</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.280" end="00:01:29.420" style="s2">psychedelics have that potential but</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.630" end="00:01:31.579" style="s2">that requires a lot of work and a really</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.420" end="00:01:33.229" style="s2">solid framework around them and we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.579" end="00:01:34.969" style="s2">really have that yet yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.229" end="00:01:36.649" style="s2">fascinating that this psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.969" end="00:01:38.240" style="s2">Renaissance is happening in the middle</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.649" end="00:01:40.490" style="s2">of this meaning crisis and I think the</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.240" end="00:01:43.789" style="s2">two are definitely linked you can go</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.490" end="00:01:45.530" style="s2">back to the sort of really high profile</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.789" end="00:01:47.450" style="s2">debates between Sam Harris and Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.530" end="00:01:49.130" style="s2">Peterson and you could argue that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.450" end="00:01:50.659" style="s2">about the meaning crisis as well but how</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.130" end="00:01:52.490" style="s2">do we make sense of the world do we need</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.659" end="00:01:55.189" style="s2">it do we need a religious framework to</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.490" end="00:01:57.350" style="s2">do so the one thing that they do agree</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.189" end="00:01:59.329" style="s2">on is the value of psychedelics or the</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.350" end="00:02:00.950" style="s2">importance of psychedelics Sam Harris</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.329" end="00:02:02.829" style="s2">has written a lot about how meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.950" end="00:02:04.819" style="s2">he&#39;s found a psychedelic experiences</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.829" end="00:02:06.740" style="s2">Jordan Peterson hasn&#39;t talked openly</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.819" end="00:02:09.800" style="s2">about his own psychedelic experience has</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.740" end="00:02:12.230" style="s2">been he has at the core of his maps of</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.800" end="00:02:14.120" style="s2">meaning lecture is a lot of talk about</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.230" end="00:02:17.160" style="s2">the value of psychedelics the importance</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.120" end="00:02:19.830" style="s2">of psychedelics the fact that they show</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.160" end="00:02:21.920" style="s2">there is the mystery of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.830" end="00:02:24.480" style="s2">there is this experience that</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.920" end="00:02:27.330" style="s2">materialist science has no idea how to</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.480" end="00:02:29.820" style="s2">process whatsoever but can be very</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.330" end="00:02:33.630" style="s2">meaningful very very therapeutic and</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.820" end="00:02:37.650" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s also replicable and as an</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.630" end="00:02:40.050" style="s2">expert is an experience of the mystery</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.650" end="00:02:43.530" style="s2">the divine or something that can be</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.050" end="00:02:46.890" style="s2">reliably replicated in people and we</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.530" end="00:02:48.330" style="s2">have no not even any framework for so</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.890" end="00:02:50.790" style="s2">regular viewers to the channel might</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.330" end="00:02:52.110" style="s2">know that this is something that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.790" end="00:02:54.870" style="s2">both been interested in for quite a</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.110" end="00:02:57.930" style="s2">while I&#39;ve done pieces about it for the</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.870" end="00:03:01.380" style="s2">BBC and for Channel 4 News going back</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.930" end="00:03:02.550" style="s2">about first one was in about 2008 so</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.380" end="00:03:04.350" style="s2">I&#39;ve been following this story for quite</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.550" end="00:03:05.820" style="s2">a while what&#39;s really interesting about</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.350" end="00:03:08.520" style="s2">the films were putting out now is that</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.820" end="00:03:10.410" style="s2">there feels like there&#39;s a real shift so</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.520" end="00:03:12.570" style="s2">for a while that the enthusiasm was</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.410" end="00:03:14.610" style="s2">about psychedelic the psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.570" end="00:03:17.130" style="s2">Renaissance that these substances were</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.610" end="00:03:18.420" style="s2">being used as medicines somehow the</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.130" end="00:03:20.730" style="s2">films that we&#39;re putting out are a</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.420" end="00:03:22.020" style="s2">little bit more cautionary there are but</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.730" end="00:03:23.850" style="s2">I think that reflects where the</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.020" end="00:03:26.580" style="s2">conversation is at right now among</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.850" end="00:03:28.320" style="s2">people in the psychedelic community who</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.580" end="00:03:31.080" style="s2">are still very enthusiastic about the</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.320" end="00:03:34.290" style="s2">potential of psychedelics for medicine</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.080" end="00:03:37.380" style="s2">and for cultural transformation but are</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.290" end="00:03:38.670" style="s2">also feeling like well we&#39;ve got to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.380" end="00:03:40.860" style="s2">careful here and I think we&#39;ll talk</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.670" end="00:03:42.090" style="s2">about the different areas of that but</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.860" end="00:03:46.050" style="s2">maybe we&#39;ll talk a little bit about our</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.090" end="00:03:47.340" style="s2">kind of backgrounds first yeah so around</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.050" end="00:03:50.010" style="s2">the same time you were covering that for</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.340" end="00:03:53.160" style="s2">the BBC I wrote a novel around</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.010" end="00:03:54.180" style="s2">psychedelics and it was a you know I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.160" end="00:03:57.390" style="s2">say psychedelics one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.180" end="00:04:00.209" style="s2">formative things in my development into</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.390" end="00:04:02.670" style="s2">my life and as I had an article in The</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.209" end="00:04:04.200" style="s2">Guardian which got some really angry</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.670" end="00:04:08.160" style="s2">comments actually underneath it at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.200" end="00:04:10.680" style="s2">time it also 2009 and then I&#39;m one of</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.160" end="00:04:12.120" style="s2">the organizers of a conference called</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.680" end="00:04:13.560" style="s2">breaking Convention which happens every</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.120" end="00:04:15.270" style="s2">two years it&#39;s around psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.560" end="00:04:16.140" style="s2">science and culture it&#39;s been growing</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.270" end="00:04:18.959" style="s2">and growing as well</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.140" end="00:04:21.890" style="s2">so my own personal trajectory has also</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.959" end="00:04:24.690" style="s2">been one of extreme excitement into</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.890" end="00:04:27.240" style="s2">extreme caution and then up into kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.690" end="00:04:30.930" style="s2">a hopeful excitement but tempered with</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.240" end="00:04:31.230" style="s2">caution because I&#39;ve seen I&#39;ve seen lots</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.930" end="00:04:32.820" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.230" end="00:04:34.590" style="s2">different ways people have used</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.820" end="00:04:36.060" style="s2">psychedelics lots of ways they&#39;ve used</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.590" end="00:04:38.370" style="s2">them that would have been better they</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.060" end="00:04:41.040" style="s2">never taken them at all I&#39;ve seen a lot</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.370" end="00:04:43.770" style="s2">of ways in which it has not impacted the</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.040" end="00:04:45.750" style="s2">culture like it like they could have and</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.770" end="00:04:48.240" style="s2">so there is I think I&#39;m probably not the</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.750" end="00:04:50.610" style="s2">only one in you know in the community</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.240" end="00:04:53.760" style="s2">who feels like that around them so</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.610" end="00:04:56.850" style="s2">putting out three pieces one is called</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.760" end="00:04:59.400" style="s2">magic medicine question mark asking the</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.850" end="00:05:02.070" style="s2">question whether they are whether they</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.400" end="00:05:04.860" style="s2">can be used effectively as medicines so</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.070" end="00:05:07.910" style="s2">there&#39;s been a lot of research done in</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.860" end="00:05:10.980" style="s2">the UK in London at Imperial College</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.910" end="00:05:12.750" style="s2">around psilocybin - the active</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.980" end="00:05:14.880" style="s2">ingredient in magic mushrooms being used</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.750" end="00:05:17.010" style="s2">for depression and the idea being that</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.880" end="00:05:19.440" style="s2">it can get us out of rumination it can</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.010" end="00:05:21.230" style="s2">get us out of habitual ways of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.440" end="00:05:25.740" style="s2">that a characteristic of depression and</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.230" end="00:05:29.670" style="s2">a camera crew was allowed into the end</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.740" end="00:05:31.440" style="s2">of the first pilot study and captured</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.670" end="00:05:33.600" style="s2">the experience of three people and</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.440" end="00:05:35.790" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting about that film is</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.600" end="00:05:38.310" style="s2">that it shows a very mixed picture a</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.790" end="00:05:41.670" style="s2">very mixed picture so it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.310" end="00:05:43.410" style="s2">something of a cautionary tale and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.670" end="00:05:45.990" style="s2">we&#39;ve got some clips from that film and</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.410" end="00:05:50.100" style="s2">then an interview with the director and</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.990" end="00:05:52.580" style="s2">with the psychologist who led many of</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.100" end="00:05:55.080" style="s2">the sessions were sitting in there with</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.580" end="00:05:56.220" style="s2">the the participant at the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.080" end="00:05:57.630" style="s2">day when they&#39;re talking through their</p>

<p begin="00:06:38.760" end="00:06:42.060" style="s2">much saying he thinks that the</p>

<p begin="00:06:42.060" end="00:06:46.110" style="s2">he&#39;s pretty clear about that he says</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.950" end="00:06:48.330" style="s2">that the the forces in play already are</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.110" end="00:06:50.370" style="s2">unstoppable and that&#39;s where that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.330" end="00:06:52.919" style="s2">where it&#39;s going and then also</p>

<p begin="00:06:52.919" end="00:06:57.720" style="s2">works a lot with addiction and he talks</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.010" end="00:06:59.310" style="s2">about how it can be used how</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.720" end="00:07:01.730" style="s2">psychedelics can be used to treat</p>

<p begin="00:07:05.880" end="00:07:09.870" style="s2">coming out of stealing those are just</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.260" end="00:07:12.960" style="s2">the factors I&#39;m watching you know and</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.870" end="00:07:14.880" style="s2">and and I would imagine that I mean a</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.960" end="00:07:18.450" style="s2">they&#39;re all already happening so none of</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.880" end="00:07:21.270" style="s2">this is sort of you know Cassandra</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.450" end="00:07:22.889" style="s2">you know magining worse scenarios and</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.270" end="00:07:25.320" style="s2">saying well what if that happens these</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.889" end="00:07:27.030" style="s2">are all already happening the question</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.320" end="00:07:28.830" style="s2">is just where do they lead us I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.030" end="00:07:30.300" style="s2">it&#39;s really interesting Jamie&#39;s points</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.830" end="00:07:32.910" style="s2">you know when I listen to them resonated</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.300" end="00:07:34.680" style="s2">a lot because they he talks about this</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.910" end="00:07:37.410" style="s2">kind of psychedelic narcissism and this</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.680" end="00:07:38.669" style="s2">kind of Instagram efficacious of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.410" end="00:07:40.500" style="s2">psychedelic experience and people are</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.669" end="00:07:42.720" style="s2">like hey I&#39;m in Peru drinking ayahuasca</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.500" end="00:07:44.639" style="s2">and I&#39;m there&#39;s just the lack of</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.720" end="00:07:46.550" style="s2">structure and the lack of integrity that</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.639" end="00:07:51.030" style="s2">a lot of people working with those</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.550" end="00:07:53.100" style="s2">plants are showing and it&#39;s just what</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.030" end="00:07:55.350" style="s2">what struck me is that psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.100" end="00:07:57.690" style="s2">traditionally and through shamanism are</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.350" end="00:08:01.620" style="s2">so different in the way they were used</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.690" end="00:08:03.990" style="s2">to the kind of mimimi narcissism culture</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.620" end="00:08:05.010" style="s2">you know it was very much a case of like</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.990" end="00:08:06.870" style="s2">a big part of the psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.010" end="00:08:10.080" style="s2">experiences is being able to sit with</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.870" end="00:08:12.000" style="s2">pain and to be able to go through an</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.080" end="00:08:13.320" style="s2">experience that is not glamorous that is</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.000" end="00:08:15.210" style="s2">not something you want to share that is</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.320" end="00:08:17.610" style="s2">actually traditionally been sacred so</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.210" end="00:08:19.380" style="s2">you don&#39;t share it around it&#39;s even the</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.610" end="00:08:22.410" style="s2">illusion in mysteries which used to</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.380" end="00:08:24.060" style="s2">happen in ancient Greece were you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.410" end="00:08:25.590" style="s2">they almost certainly used a psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.060" end="00:08:26.729" style="s2">substance you weren&#39;t allowed to talk</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.590" end="00:08:30.240" style="s2">about it at all</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.729" end="00:08:32.280" style="s2">with anyone and the one one man was you</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.240" end="00:08:34.620" style="s2">know there&#39;s a record of someone doing</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.280" end="00:08:36.570" style="s2">it in his house for his friends and that</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.620" end="00:08:38.729" style="s2">was like punishable by death you know so</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.570" end="00:08:40.709" style="s2">just the sheer contrast of how</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.729" end="00:08:42.180" style="s2">psychedelics have been used and what</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.709" end="00:08:44.089" style="s2">Jamie wheel is talking about with this</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.180" end="00:08:47.070" style="s2">narcissistic</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.089" end="00:08:49.050" style="s2">appearance only culture is is a bizarre</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.070" end="00:08:50.580" style="s2">state of affairs to be in so I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.050" end="00:08:53.160" style="s2">we&#39;ve both had this sense for quite a</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.580" end="00:08:54.030" style="s2">while of when is it going to break</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.160" end="00:08:57.510" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.030" end="00:08:59.070" style="s2">come more mainstream and feeling oh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.510" end="00:09:01.230" style="s2">now it&#39;s now it&#39;s now and it definitely</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.070" end="00:09:02.430" style="s2">has now and we&#39;re in the middle I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.230" end="00:09:04.140" style="s2">everyone would acknowledge we&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.430" end="00:09:07.350" style="s2">middle of the psychedelic Renaissance if</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.140" end="00:09:10.320" style="s2">the original psychedelic wave was the</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.350" end="00:09:12.270" style="s2">1960s we&#39;re back in the Renaissance and</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.320" end="00:09:14.040" style="s2">I think the the publication of Michael</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.270" end="00:09:18.060" style="s2">Pollan&#39;s book how to change your mind</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.040" end="00:09:21.230" style="s2">was a big moment there but the</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.060" end="00:09:24.540" style="s2">conversation has definitely shifted and</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.230" end="00:09:27.180" style="s2">now the conversation is are we in danger</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.540" end="00:09:29.840" style="s2">of replicating some of the mistakes of</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.180" end="00:09:34.020" style="s2">the 1960s where we had this huge</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.840" end="00:09:36.180" style="s2">exuberance around it and then the though</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.020" end="00:09:38.010" style="s2">the dark side of psychedelics came in</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.180" end="00:09:40.950" style="s2">more and more and it became increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.010" end="00:09:43.980" style="s2">undeniable as to that dark side we</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.950" end="00:09:45.420" style="s2">realized as one of the the people in in</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.980" end="00:09:46.950" style="s2">the films we were putting out talks</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.420" end="00:09:49.500" style="s2">about them they are nonspecific</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.950" end="00:09:51.390" style="s2">amplifiers and this is something a lot</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.500" end="00:09:54.390" style="s2">of enthusiasm at psychedelics don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.390" end="00:09:56.430" style="s2">necessarily acknowledge they&#39;re not they</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.390" end="00:09:57.990" style="s2">will amplify anything that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.430" end="00:09:59.460" style="s2">feeling and by definition they will</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.990" end="00:10:02.640" style="s2">amplify everything in the culture as</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.460" end="00:10:05.340" style="s2">well and it&#39;s not it&#39;s not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.640" end="00:10:07.260" style="s2">just a positive thing I mean I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.340" end="00:10:08.670" style="s2">it&#39;s good to also step back about forty</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.260" end="00:10:11.220" style="s2">thousand years to the original</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.670" end="00:10:14.010" style="s2">psychedelic Renaissance arguably was you</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.220" end="00:10:15.930" style="s2">know there was a big shift in human</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.010" end="00:10:17.250" style="s2">beings and our capacity to make art make</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.930" end="00:10:19.560" style="s2">culture and some have linked that to</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.250" end="00:10:21.120" style="s2">increase use of psychedelics then even</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.560" end="00:10:22.410" style="s2">John robic he has talked about this a</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.120" end="00:10:23.670" style="s2">couple of times as well that role</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.410" end="00:10:27.960" style="s2">psychedelics have played in our</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.670" end="00:10:29.880" style="s2">development as a species and it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.960" end="00:10:31.980" style="s2">rare that psychedelics are just in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.880" end="00:10:33.210" style="s2">entire culture it&#39;s really rare john</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.980" end="00:10:35.310" style="s2">vivec he talks about this really well</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.210" end="00:10:37.020" style="s2">around you know still tended to be only</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.310" end="00:10:38.640" style="s2">a few people were taking them though the</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.020" end="00:10:40.980" style="s2">shaman would take the psychedelics and</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.640" end="00:10:42.930" style="s2">be able to tap into a different way of</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.980" end="00:10:44.580" style="s2">seeing be able to connect patterns</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.930" end="00:10:46.260" style="s2">together that no one else could and go</p>

<p begin="00:10:47.940" end="00:10:52.050" style="s2">that because he knows shaman actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.800" end="00:10:53.460" style="s2">means he who knows or she he or she even</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.050" end="00:10:55.230" style="s2">knows person who knows so you have</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.460" end="00:10:56.640" style="s2">access to some information but not</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.230" end="00:10:58.950" style="s2">everyone had access to the information</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.640" end="00:11:01.290" style="s2">so at the risk of putting on a very very</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.950" end="00:11:04.770" style="s2">unpopular opinion I&#39;ve come to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.290" end="00:11:06.600" style="s2">conclusion not conclusion but I wander</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.770" end="00:11:06.970" style="s2">often whether psychedelics should ever</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.600" end="00:11:08.860" style="s2">become</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.970" end="00:11:13.089" style="s2">mainstream or whether they should be</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.860" end="00:11:14.350" style="s2">used after training like you know we</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.089" end="00:11:16.389" style="s2">don&#39;t let everyone is drive a car who</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.350" end="00:11:18.279" style="s2">wants to or pilot a plane there&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:11:18.279" end="00:11:22.240" style="s2">that and that&#39;s the way it&#39;s been for a</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.319" end="00:11:24.310" style="s2">very very long time in fact that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.240" end="00:11:25.930" style="s2">way we figured out as a species how to</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.310" end="00:11:26.980" style="s2">use to academics safely so that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.930" end="00:11:29.170" style="s2">open question for me</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.980" end="00:11:31.209" style="s2">are we playing with fire so if you look</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.170" end="00:11:33.730" style="s2">back at the 60s and the first sort of</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.209" end="00:11:36.699" style="s2">psychedelic wave you see this incredible</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.730" end="00:11:38.740" style="s2">level of creativity you see the level of</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.699" end="00:11:40.899" style="s2">but the music that came out at the time</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.740" end="00:11:42.939" style="s2">was heavily influenced by it it was this</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.899" end="00:11:47.560" style="s2">kind of liberation of creative energy</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.939" end="00:11:49.629" style="s2">for sure I also question whether they</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.560" end="00:11:51.759" style="s2">are playing exactly the same role as</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.629" end="00:11:53.439" style="s2">they did in the past and there&#39;s a sort</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.759" end="00:11:56.470" style="s2">of a sense of there were there are a lot</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.439" end="00:11:58.480" style="s2">of kind of mental straitjackets to break</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.470" end="00:12:02.680" style="s2">out of in the 60s that I&#39;m not entirely</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.480" end="00:12:04.449" style="s2">sure are the same nowadays and what I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.680" end="00:12:08.230" style="s2">perceived in the psychedelic community</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.449" end="00:12:11.860" style="s2">is a lot of actually a lot of groupthink</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.230" end="00:12:14.980" style="s2">a lot of very very similar perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.860" end="00:12:16.449" style="s2">like the idea that there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.980" end="00:12:18.639" style="s2">narrative in a psychedelic community</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.449" end="00:12:21.629" style="s2">which is yeah everyone else is following</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.639" end="00:12:24.160" style="s2">this kind of corporate programming and</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.629" end="00:12:25.449" style="s2">free your minds with psychedelics and</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.160" end="00:12:26.889" style="s2">then you&#39;ll be kind of be able to see</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.449" end="00:12:28.990" style="s2">through the patterns you&#39;ll be able to</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.889" end="00:12:31.569" style="s2">see what&#39;s really going on which tends</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.990" end="00:12:34.000" style="s2">to degenerate into outright conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.569" end="00:12:35.949" style="s2">theory a lot of the time like huge</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.000" end="00:12:37.300" style="s2">amounts of conspiracy conspiratorial</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.949" end="00:12:38.829" style="s2">thinking within the psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.300" end="00:12:41.470" style="s2">community and very similar</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.829" end="00:12:43.689" style="s2">conspiratorial thinking as well which is</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.470" end="00:12:46.509" style="s2">sort of I think is is mostly a</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.689" end="00:12:48.459" style="s2">projection of sort of internal stuff out</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.509" end="00:12:51.040" style="s2">into the world unresolved internal stuff</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.459" end="00:12:53.589" style="s2">out into the world but also even the</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.040" end="00:12:55.680" style="s2">there&#39;s very little political diversity</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.589" end="00:13:01.420" style="s2">in the psychedelic community nowadays</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.680" end="00:13:04.360" style="s2">which if psychedelics were kind of had</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.420" end="00:13:06.430" style="s2">the effect of freeing our minds you</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.360" end="00:13:08.740" style="s2">would expect more diversity not less</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.430" end="00:13:11.079" style="s2">whereas I think what it often does is</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.740" end="00:13:12.370" style="s2">becomes a bit an induction into it into</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.079" end="00:13:14.230" style="s2">a way of thinking about the world that</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.370" end="00:13:14.860" style="s2">seems very it&#39;s another form of</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.230" end="00:13:17.319" style="s2">groupthink</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.860" end="00:13:19.540" style="s2">yeah and and that there&#39;s a phrase that</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.319" end="00:13:22.150" style="s2">psychedelics are nonspecific amplifiers</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.540" end="00:13:24.400" style="s2">from stanislav grof and if you are in an</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.150" end="00:13:25.810" style="s2">environment that is a certain way and</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.400" end="00:13:27.190" style="s2">you take a psychedelic it you know has a</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.810" end="00:13:28.750" style="s2">certain amount of preconceptions about</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.190" end="00:13:31.180" style="s2">the experience has a certain political</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.750" end="00:13:33.010" style="s2">leaning is most likely that that will be</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.180" end="00:13:35.170" style="s2">enhanced in you so it can create a</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.010" end="00:13:36.850" style="s2">certain filter bubbles very powerfully I</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.170" end="00:13:38.530" style="s2">mean it&#39;s also an open question for me</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.850" end="00:13:42.520" style="s2">this point about political diversity I</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.530" end="00:13:43.600" style="s2">don&#39;t think I&#39;ve met maybe 0.1% of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.520" end="00:13:45.790" style="s2">people I&#39;ve met the psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.600" end="00:13:48.580" style="s2">community are not quite left-leaning I</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.790" end="00:13:52.770" style="s2">mean it&#39;s really like it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.580" end="00:13:55.240" style="s2">impossible to find someone who isn&#39;t so</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.770" end="00:13:57.070" style="s2">that is that begs the question of okay</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.240" end="00:13:59.470" style="s2">either it&#39;s that point I just laid out</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.070" end="00:14:00.730" style="s2">that is free self reinforcing or is</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.470" end="00:14:03.100" style="s2">there something about the psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.730" end="00:14:05.560" style="s2">experience itself that lends itself to</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.100" end="00:14:08.080" style="s2">for example social constructivism which</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.560" end="00:14:09.490" style="s2">which arguably it could in a certain</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.080" end="00:14:11.560" style="s2">context because the psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.490" end="00:14:13.510" style="s2">experience does deconstruct and does</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.560" end="00:14:15.130" style="s2">give you the sense of there&#39;s multiple</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.510" end="00:14:17.110" style="s2">different narratives and frameworks and</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.130" end="00:14:20.890" style="s2">I can kind of see which is true anyway</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.110" end="00:14:23.500" style="s2">but also that if that&#39;s not tempered by</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.890" end="00:14:25.330" style="s2">kind of grounding in truth it can just</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.500" end="00:14:28.000" style="s2">go haywire into what you&#39;re just talking</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.330" end="00:14:30.130" style="s2">about conspiracy theory groupthink and</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.000" end="00:14:33.160" style="s2">unfortunately that&#39;s where I&#39;ve seen it</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.130" end="00:14:34.300" style="s2">going so yeah we&#39;re putting out films</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.160" end="00:14:37.570" style="s2">about psychedelics they&#39;re all a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.300" end="00:14:39.760" style="s2">a downer and but I think that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.570" end="00:14:43.570" style="s2">the conversation is at right now I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.760" end="00:14:45.040" style="s2">it is that is pretty much the cutting</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.570" end="00:14:48.540" style="s2">edge of the conversation there&#39;s still a</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.040" end="00:14:50.860" style="s2">lot of enthusiasm and potential for</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.540" end="00:14:53.050" style="s2">psychedelics that a lot of people in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.860" end="00:14:55.480" style="s2">community are feeling but increasingly I</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.050" end="00:14:57.340" style="s2">think many of the people in the psychic</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.480" end="00:15:00.040" style="s2">community I&#39;m aware of are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.340" end="00:15:01.270" style="s2">feeling a little concerned about some of</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.040" end="00:15:03.340" style="s2">the ways that things are going</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.270" end="00:15:06.160" style="s2">yeah and rightly so and this is a</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.340" end="00:15:08.740" style="s2">natural part of the process as something</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.160" end="00:15:10.300" style="s2">goes through a revival then all of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.740" end="00:15:12.190" style="s2">shadow material I think as well all the</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.300" end="00:15:14.530" style="s2">dark side of it also needs to be looked</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.190" end="00:15:18.610" style="s2">at and I think it&#39;s essential because</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.530" end="00:15:20.380" style="s2">they are they are incredible substances</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.610" end="00:15:22.920" style="s2">if use in the right way and they do have</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.380" end="00:15:25.030" style="s2">incredible potential but I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.920" end="00:15:26.950" style="s2">everyone who&#39;s involved with them needs</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.030" end="00:15:29.350" style="s2">to kind of show up and grow up around</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.950" end="00:15:32.180" style="s2">them so we&#39;ll be putting up the other</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.350" end="00:15:34.190" style="s2">films over the next few days and</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.180" end="00:15:37.540" style="s2">do enjoy them comment on them let us</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.190" end="00:15:37.540" style="s2">know what you think and see you soon</p>
