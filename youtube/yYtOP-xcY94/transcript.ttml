<p begin="00:00:01.260" end="00:00:05.460" style="s2">for to have guests board members who</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.240" end="00:00:07.379" style="s2">want to like dip their toe into figuring</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.460" end="00:00:12.480" style="s2">out what it is to create together tech</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.379" end="00:00:17.220" style="s2">together without um without committing</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.480" end="00:00:20.130" style="s2">you know CC how how it works out and so</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.220" end="00:00:22.050" style="s2">welcome to fix our world Friday which is</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.130" end="00:00:24.420" style="s2">like a slight change on the language</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.050" end="00:00:26.160" style="s2">where the graphic kept saying fix our</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.420" end="00:00:28.260" style="s2">world but I was saying fix the world</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.160" end="00:00:30.119" style="s2">which is quite different it&#39;s like fix</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.260" end="00:00:32.399" style="s2">that world it has nothing to do with me</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.119" end="00:00:34.440" style="s2">versus like our world and only our world</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.399" end="00:00:37.410" style="s2">you don&#39;t need to fix the whole one just</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.440" end="00:00:38.850" style="s2">our lives when we interact with which is</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.410" end="00:00:43.350" style="s2">the whole one but you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.850" end="00:00:45.480" style="s2">there&#39;s something there this has been</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.350" end="00:00:46.980" style="s2">two weeks since I saw you like since we</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.480" end="00:00:51.449" style="s2">did this together right been like his</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.980" end="00:00:53.789" style="s2">last because I was myself and even since</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.449" end="00:00:57.780" style="s2">that week a lot has changed like a lot</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.789" end="00:00:59.460" style="s2">has transferred this idea of so today</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.780" end="00:01:02.960" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna be talking about micro</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.460" end="00:01:07.380" style="s2">solidarity and the link is in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.960" end="00:01:09.930" style="s2">viewing but later replay viewers the</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.380" end="00:01:14.250" style="s2">link is in the description too to see</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.930" end="00:01:15.659" style="s2">that website as well as I think fractal</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.250" end="00:01:17.220" style="s2">democracy and what we talked about at</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.659" end="00:01:18.840" style="s2">the very ends of mine Jasper&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.220" end="00:01:19.979" style="s2">conversation is very relevant even</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.840" end="00:01:21.869" style="s2">though no one else will be able to hear</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.979" end="00:01:26.850" style="s2">it we can kind of recapitulate what what</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.869" end="00:01:31.320" style="s2">that was and how do we create this space</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.850" end="00:01:33.299" style="s2">into a solutions cooperative which is</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.320" end="00:01:35.220" style="s2">the like pivot that I think we were or</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.299" end="00:01:37.740" style="s2">discussing is that the pivot is that the</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.220" end="00:01:40.470" style="s2">thing that you know focusing on</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.740" end="00:01:42.270" style="s2">solutions yes we create through</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.470" end="00:01:43.590" style="s2">technology be it the solutions piece as</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.270" end="00:01:45.299" style="s2">opposed to the technology piece and is</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.590" end="00:01:47.509" style="s2">there a better name than solutions cuz</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.299" end="00:01:52.829" style="s2">it comes with a lot of baggage as well</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.509" end="00:01:54.420" style="s2">so yeah where do we start do you want to</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.829" end="00:01:58.320" style="s2">introduce Microsoft already Bentley or</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.420" end="00:02:02.040" style="s2">what would you like - um sure I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.320" end="00:02:08.129" style="s2">look into it that deeply but so a marcus</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.040" end="00:02:09.599" style="s2">already dot CC and actually it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.129" end="00:02:12.040" style="s2">several days since i put it on there</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.599" end="00:02:18.069" style="s2">some say I put it up</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.040" end="00:02:21.510" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s just very very similar where</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.069" end="00:02:24.849" style="s2">we&#39;re working on ways to communicate and</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.510" end="00:02:26.920" style="s2">you know work together as group and so I</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.849" end="00:02:30.430" style="s2">actually I think Marco solidarity may be</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.920" end="00:02:35.830" style="s2">one of the options on how we organize</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.430" end="00:02:38.080" style="s2">the group and then also there was a</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.830" end="00:02:40.120" style="s2">collective one was another thing that</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.080" end="00:02:43.600" style="s2">came up last week</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.120" end="00:02:45.340" style="s2">which is something I used there at the</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.600" end="00:02:46.690" style="s2">very beginning and it was very rough at</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.340" end="00:02:49.480" style="s2">that time so I&#39;m sure they&#39;ve improved</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.690" end="00:02:52.019" style="s2">it quite a bit since then so I&#39;d have to</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.480" end="00:02:55.370" style="s2">look at it again to see how useful it is</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.019" end="00:02:57.930" style="s2">but I think these are kind of tools for</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.370" end="00:03:01.540" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.930" end="00:03:04.599" style="s2">tools for us to kind of build this</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.540" end="00:03:08.049" style="s2">community but also each group that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.599" end="00:03:10.750" style="s2">kind of making these tools they are they</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.049" end="00:03:13.180" style="s2">seem to have very similar goals as we do</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.750" end="00:03:15.630" style="s2">which is you know to facilitate</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.180" end="00:03:20.019" style="s2">individual sovereignty and group</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.630" end="00:03:22.209" style="s2">cohesiveness so that you know so that</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.019" end="00:03:23.320" style="s2">people can kind of work on the things or</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.209" end="00:03:27.700" style="s2">make the world a better place rather</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.320" end="00:03:30.609" style="s2">than just earning a paycheck also like</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.700" end="00:03:32.350" style="s2">in spiral Network which is other</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.609" end="00:03:35.650" style="s2">creators of loomio which is another kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.350" end="00:03:37.690" style="s2">of collaborative software tool so all</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.650" end="00:03:41.530" style="s2">these things I guess I wanted to check</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.690" end="00:03:44.230" style="s2">that we aren&#39;t duplicating what anyone</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.530" end="00:03:47.560" style="s2">else is working on right now which is</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.230" end="00:03:50.139" style="s2">hard to find sometimes because I was</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.560" end="00:03:52.329" style="s2">working on the debate stuff for four</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.139" end="00:03:53.920" style="s2">years before I found a group of other</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.329" end="00:03:55.569" style="s2">people that were already working on they</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.920" end="00:03:57.579" style="s2">were all working in from four years - so</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.569" end="00:03:58.900" style="s2">we&#39;re all working in parallel all had</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.579" end="00:04:02.170" style="s2">websites that still couldn&#39;t find each</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.900" end="00:04:06.600" style="s2">other and we finally did about a year</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.170" end="00:04:08.650" style="s2">ago so in this same sort of vein just</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.600" end="00:04:10.660" style="s2">make sure that we&#39;ll keep an eye out for</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.650" end="00:04:12.790" style="s2">other things and that we&#39;re not just</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.660" end="00:04:15.100" style="s2">recreating the wheel although I think it</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.790" end="00:04:17.229" style="s2">I think and spiral had an option to</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.100" end="00:04:18.370" style="s2">where they said they even liked the idea</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.229" end="00:04:20.380" style="s2">of having a whole bunch of little</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.370" end="00:04:22.030" style="s2">different organizations working on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.380" end="00:04:23.800" style="s2">same thing and then just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.030" end="00:04:25.030" style="s2">coordinating rather than trying to have</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.800" end="00:04:27.460" style="s2">one large organization</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.030" end="00:04:29.860" style="s2">that that won&#39;t fit so much with our</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.460" end="00:04:35.620" style="s2">together tack I think together tech</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.860" end="00:04:37.570" style="s2">needs needs you know if you get everyone</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.620" end="00:04:43.600" style="s2">kind of together I think you have more</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.570" end="00:04:44.950" style="s2">synergy yeah so I guess those are the</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.600" end="00:04:48.340" style="s2">just the things that I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.950" end="00:04:50.080" style="s2">through is is what you know what what</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.340" end="00:04:53.140" style="s2">who else is out there doing some similar</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.080" end="00:04:57.700" style="s2">things how can we coordinate collaborate</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.140" end="00:05:00.490" style="s2">or subsume their projects there are</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.700" end="00:05:02.050" style="s2">projects and stuff like that so you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.490" end="00:05:04.750" style="s2">I don&#39;t have any definite direction on</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.050" end="00:05:07.180" style="s2">that so what came up for me this week</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.750" end="00:05:10.240" style="s2">with not so much Microsoft already but</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.180" end="00:05:14.200" style="s2">with the other one the said collective</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.240" end="00:05:16.540" style="s2">ano it was collective one for that the</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.200" end="00:05:18.700" style="s2">fact that we hadn&#39;t heard about it or</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.540" end="00:05:19.870" style="s2">like you had said you you know like I</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.700" end="00:05:21.820" style="s2">think I probably just changed what it</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.870" end="00:05:23.500" style="s2">looks likes you now registered you were</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.820" end="00:05:25.900" style="s2">on at the beginning but that were like</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.500" end="00:05:30.850" style="s2">looking in this space and these things</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.900" end="00:05:33.490" style="s2">pop up and that is the reason I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.850" end="00:05:36.190" style="s2">like the broken up but I get why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.490" end="00:05:38.200" style="s2">and that we need it right like we need a</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.190" end="00:05:40.210" style="s2">bunch of games a bunch of experiments</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.200" end="00:05:42.010" style="s2">going on to see which one works but</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.210" end="00:05:43.240" style="s2">they&#39;re not working because they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.010" end="00:05:45.280" style="s2">broken up and everywhere and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.240" end="00:05:47.410" style="s2">the fact we we knew we had a problem we</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.280" end="00:05:49.390" style="s2">need to solve we&#39;re looking for these</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.410" end="00:05:51.190" style="s2">things and not able to find them what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.390" end="00:05:52.090" style="s2">the hope and everyone else finding them</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.190" end="00:05:55.060" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t even know they&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.090" end="00:05:57.940" style="s2">for it right and so bringing those</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.060" end="00:05:59.770" style="s2">projects together in a way that supports</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.940" end="00:06:03.460" style="s2">them kind of like we&#39;re doing with the</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.770" end="00:06:05.800" style="s2">raising projects on Saturdays we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.460" end="00:06:08.770" style="s2">figuring out marketing together and</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.800" end="00:06:11.229" style="s2">finance together of like right well when</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.770" end="00:06:13.540" style="s2">these amazing projects happen whether</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.229" end="00:06:15.729" style="s2">they&#39;re internally you know game B type</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.540" end="00:06:19.540" style="s2">people or externally just really cool</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.729" end="00:06:21.190" style="s2">projects or nothing to do with a B but</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.540" end="00:06:24.580" style="s2">they meet another need of ours right</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.190" end="00:06:26.260" style="s2">what how do we know that they exist how</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.580" end="00:06:28.780" style="s2">do we kind of fix marketing for the</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.260" end="00:06:32.140" style="s2">world and that&#39;s not necessarily what</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.780" end="00:06:34.000" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna be doing but it is something</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.140" end="00:06:37.330" style="s2">that I don&#39;t know if anyone is doing</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.000" end="00:06:38.590" style="s2">like that&#39;s it&#39;s this under this idea</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.330" end="00:06:40.060" style="s2">that people will find each</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.590" end="00:06:41.500" style="s2">and that is what microcell Adara t talks</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.060" end="00:06:43.090" style="s2">about is like they don&#39;t give you a</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.500" end="00:06:46.270" style="s2">system to find the people they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.090" end="00:06:48.130" style="s2">you&#39;ll find the people and I don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.270" end="00:06:51.760" style="s2">that I want there to be tools to find</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.130" end="00:06:53.889" style="s2">your people because not everyone can</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.760" end="00:06:56.050" style="s2">easily find them and the more that</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.889" end="00:06:59.139" style="s2">you&#39;re able to coordinate just just the</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.050" end="00:07:01.000" style="s2">finding of people and then the running</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.139" end="00:07:02.139" style="s2">of a group or like how you then form up</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.000" end="00:07:04.530" style="s2">the other ones and that&#39;s where like</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.139" end="00:07:06.610" style="s2">fractal democracy or something comes in</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.530" end="00:07:08.260" style="s2">because there was something about like a</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.610" end="00:07:13.479" style="s2">group of eights and a group of seven and</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.260" end="00:07:16.210" style="s2">like that that number of its resilience</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.479" end="00:07:18.669" style="s2">and yet the problems can get solved but</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.210" end="00:07:21.580" style="s2">not really like part of it as sharing</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.669" end="00:07:23.110" style="s2">finance is a micro solidarity and so a</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.580" end="00:07:25.060" style="s2">bunch of millionaires getting together</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.110" end="00:07:27.100" style="s2">and sharing finances and sharing you</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.060" end="00:07:28.479" style="s2">know resources is gonna be able to be a</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.100" end="00:07:31.300" style="s2">lot more powerful and create something</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.479" end="00:07:32.800" style="s2">than a bunch of people in poverty you</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.300" end="00:07:35.979" style="s2">can still it&#39;s still more powerful to</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.800" end="00:07:37.930" style="s2">come together but there&#39;s like no</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.979" end="00:07:40.960" style="s2">ownership or no one&#39;s really talking</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.930" end="00:07:42.430" style="s2">about like the that it leaves some it</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.960" end="00:07:45.370" style="s2">leaves a lot of people on it even more</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.430" end="00:07:47.770" style="s2">so than financially like autistic people</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.370" end="00:07:50.200" style="s2">like people who like feel time and time</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.770" end="00:07:51.850" style="s2">again that they&#39;ve been excluded and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.200" end="00:07:53.770" style="s2">to just say oh you&#39;ll find your people</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.850" end="00:07:56.289" style="s2">when like there&#39;s that deep wound that</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.770" end="00:07:58.090" style="s2">keeps repeating itself without giving</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.289" end="00:08:00.100" style="s2">people like right maybe you won&#39;t maybe</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.090" end="00:08:01.780" style="s2">you are the kind of person that 99% of</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.100" end="00:08:05.530" style="s2">people don&#39;t really resonate with will</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.780" end="00:08:08.740" style="s2">help you find the 1% that do and what</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.530" end="00:08:11.260" style="s2">comes out of that and so that&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.740" end="00:08:12.760" style="s2">something coming out for me and all of</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.260" end="00:08:16.539" style="s2">this like the micro solidarity and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.760" end="00:08:17.860" style="s2">fractal democracy and partly what I put</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.539" end="00:08:22.210" style="s2">on the agenda which I don&#39;t even want to</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.860" end="00:08:24.930" style="s2">get into today of like actually solving</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.210" end="00:08:24.930" style="s2">solutions together</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.499" end="00:08:32.089" style="s2">which I kind of tried to do with</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.319" end="00:08:34.399" style="s2">extinction rebellion and tried it like</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.089" end="00:08:36.469" style="s2">to have a mission like something and</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.399" end="00:08:38.389" style="s2">it&#39;s not an extinction rebellion because</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.469" end="00:08:40.819" style="s2">they don&#39;t they have concrete goals but</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.389" end="00:08:46.550" style="s2">not really concrete goals what Vinnie a</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.819" end="00:08:48.889" style="s2">Gupta had said of that the ethical that</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.550" end="00:08:51.889" style="s2">would to get to zero slaves and three</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.889" end="00:08:54.199" style="s2">tons of carbon is something that is like</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.889" end="00:08:57.199" style="s2">measurable to some degree and obtainable</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.199" end="00:08:58.910" style="s2">but not in isolation not in groups of</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.199" end="00:09:00.230" style="s2">eight not you know maybe and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.910" end="00:09:01.850" style="s2">I mean by like a millionaire&#39;s could</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.230" end="00:09:04.399" style="s2">solve that for you for themselves and</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.850" end="00:09:07.519" style="s2">maybe get to zero slaves and zero and</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.399" end="00:09:09.560" style="s2">you know three tons of carbon but not</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.519" end="00:09:10.579" style="s2">the rest of us you know like you need to</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.560" end="00:09:12.709" style="s2">have a certain amount of power and</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.579" end="00:09:14.959" style="s2">privilege to be able to do that or large</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.709" end="00:09:17.990" style="s2">numbers of people ten thousand a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.959" end="00:09:19.459" style="s2">thousand a million of us could solve how</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.990" end="00:09:21.800" style="s2">to get our food or clothing or shelter</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.459" end="00:09:24.319" style="s2">without slavery and without this huge</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.800" end="00:09:26.389" style="s2">carbon footprint how when something</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.319" end="00:09:28.009" style="s2">helps us have less slaves and less</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.389" end="00:09:32.449" style="s2">carbon footprint it actually propagates</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.009" end="00:09:36.290" style="s2">and gets out in the world and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.449" end="00:09:38.899" style="s2">something about like creating this to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.290" end="00:09:41.060" style="s2">a space or creating something similar</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.899" end="00:09:42.980" style="s2">like a conference where people are</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.060" end="00:09:46.189" style="s2">talking maybe in an idea cafe type</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.980" end="00:09:48.980" style="s2">format about that like not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.189" end="00:09:52.670" style="s2">how do we sell slavery but like food</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.980" end="00:09:55.459" style="s2">shelter clothing transportation these</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.670" end="00:09:56.779" style="s2">are things we need and they come in and</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.459" end="00:09:58.880" style="s2">with externalities that we&#39;re passing</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.779" end="00:10:00.560" style="s2">off to the rest of the world so to look</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.880" end="00:10:05.509" style="s2">at what are we actually doing in those</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.560" end="00:10:06.889" style="s2">spaces and then what effect does that</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.509" end="00:10:08.899" style="s2">have right so here&#39;s what I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.889" end="00:10:10.430" style="s2">doing for food here&#39;s the effect that</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.899" end="00:10:11.750" style="s2">has on my health and my lifestyle here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.430" end="00:10:13.250" style="s2">the effect it has on the planet I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.750" end="00:10:14.779" style="s2">you know you not necessarily hard</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.250" end="00:10:17.029" style="s2">science I know that some of my food</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.779" end="00:10:18.769" style="s2">choices are maybe the greatest and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.029" end="00:10:22.100" style="s2">what effect it has on other people and</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.769" end="00:10:24.589" style="s2">through having those conversations um</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.100" end="00:10:28.939" style="s2">and then like right before this this</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.589" end="00:10:31.850" style="s2">call I was there was like I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.939" end="00:10:34.040" style="s2">like the idea Cafe conference every six</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.850" end="00:10:35.480" style="s2">hours and like merges with micro Sol</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.040" end="00:10:38.449" style="s2">that arity where you actually a meeting</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.480" end="00:10:39.810" style="s2">with the same seven people and answering</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.449" end="00:10:41.250" style="s2">this so you&#39;re focused</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.810" end="00:10:44.180" style="s2">food right because that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.250" end="00:10:46.410" style="s2">that&#39;s important to you and then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.180" end="00:10:47.940" style="s2">electing someone out of that seven to</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.410" end="00:10:49.800" style="s2">get to the next level to kind of talk</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.940" end="00:10:51.120" style="s2">about the greater food but then maybe</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.800" end="00:10:52.560" style="s2">there is like after you kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.120" end="00:10:53.880" style="s2">certain level all of the people are</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.560" end="00:10:56.490" style="s2">getting together in touch to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.880" end="00:10:58.070" style="s2">it that&#39;s like more complexity and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.490" end="00:11:00.900" style="s2">like cats we&#39;re figuring out this</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.070" end="00:11:03.450" style="s2">scheduling tool or like even just that</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.900" end="00:11:06.060" style="s2">piece because that&#39;s powerful but</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.450" end="00:11:08.760" style="s2">there&#39;s something here where when we</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.060" end="00:11:11.130" style="s2">turn this or pivot it to be a solutions</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.760" end="00:11:15.029" style="s2">cooperative instead of a technology</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.130" end="00:11:20.370" style="s2">cooperative there&#39;s a way to have this</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.029" end="00:11:23.370" style="s2">space already work on solutions and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.370" end="00:11:24.779" style="s2">technology will merge or emerge yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.370" end="00:11:26.880" style="s2">some of those solutions require</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.779" end="00:11:28.650" style="s2">technology some won&#39;t and those ones</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.880" end="00:11:33.240" style="s2">that won&#39;t they&#39;ll be people there you</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.650" end="00:11:36.240" style="s2">know that want to work on those actual</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.240" end="00:11:39.330" style="s2">atoms which is not something I do much</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.240" end="00:11:42.960" style="s2">what so as look in the market solidarity</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.330" end="00:11:45.960" style="s2">and so this sentence kind of keys in</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.960" end="00:11:48.000" style="s2">kind of what we&#39;re saying I think so he</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.960" end="00:11:49.710" style="s2">was saying I intend to start a new</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.000" end="00:11:51.390" style="s2">community as a sibling or cousin to</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.710" end="00:11:54.180" style="s2">inspire oh so actually I could just get</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.390" end="00:12:01.260" style="s2">that so about 30 to 20 people supporting</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.180" end="00:12:04.200" style="s2">each other to do more meaningful work so</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.260" end="00:12:05.940" style="s2">and that sounds kind of what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.200" end="00:12:08.400" style="s2">it&#39;s another way of phrasing it no it</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.940" end="00:12:10.050" style="s2">wasn&#39;t as solutions focused but you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.400" end="00:12:16.710" style="s2">that&#39;s the goal it&#39;s you and I want to</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.050" end="00:12:19.170" style="s2">be providing max value to the world so</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.710" end="00:12:22.410" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s interesting that he&#39;s trying</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.170" end="00:12:23.670" style="s2">to develop a it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.410" end="00:12:26.670" style="s2">well it&#39;s interesting that he limits it</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.670" end="00:12:31.440" style="s2">to don&#39;t like 230 people which I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.670" end="00:12:37.850" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to find a pattern and if</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.440" end="00:12:39.770" style="s2">necessary technology to facilitate that</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.850" end="00:12:43.830" style="s2">exponentially and over the long run</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.770" end="00:12:46.339" style="s2">mm-hm would be kind of Michael yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.830" end="00:12:48.690" style="s2">absolutely and I think that that is</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.339" end="00:12:50.430" style="s2">possible there was a lot in that</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.690" end="00:12:51.960" style="s2">proposal I read the whole proposal and</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.430" end="00:12:54.089" style="s2">there was a lot in there</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.960" end="00:12:55.200" style="s2">spoke to me and there was nothing in</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.089" end="00:12:57.660" style="s2">there I was like well that&#39;s broke and</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.200" end="00:12:59.310" style="s2">it needs to go the only piece is I want</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.660" end="00:13:01.440" style="s2">it to be facilitated I want to help</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.310" end="00:13:02.760" style="s2">people find their people and then have a</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.440" end="00:13:05.520" style="s2">little more coordination behind the</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.760" end="00:13:06.839" style="s2">marketing and the finance so that like</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.520" end="00:13:08.640" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of the vision it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.839" end="00:13:10.380" style="s2">everyone joins together tech and we all</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.640" end="00:13:12.000" style="s2">have a new cults and we all become you</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.380" end="00:13:14.100" style="s2">know tommy-toms of each other of course</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.000" end="00:13:17.610" style="s2">not like it&#39;s how do you as an</p>

<p begin="00:15:02.760" end="00:15:05.760" style="s2">remarks a sort of stream of</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.380" end="00:15:07.230" style="s2">consciousness remarks I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.760" end="00:15:10.520" style="s2">based on hearing what I just heard you</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.230" end="00:15:13.560" style="s2">guys say what you just said a minute ago</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.520" end="00:15:16.500" style="s2">Jubilee it sounds like you&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.560" end="00:15:19.880" style="s2">for a technology to facilitate anarchism</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.500" end="00:15:21.990" style="s2">the political ideology of anarchism I</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.880" end="00:15:23.460" style="s2">don&#39;t don&#39;t want to go anywhere with</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.990" end="00:15:25.170" style="s2">that remark I think that&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.460" end="00:15:30.180" style="s2">statement of how I&#39;m perceiving what</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.170" end="00:15:31.620" style="s2">when you&#39;re proposing and the the</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.180" end="00:15:33.750" style="s2">question of how to work together with</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.620" end="00:15:36.600" style="s2">different people and first of all to</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.750" end="00:15:38.640" style="s2">find your people as you put it the find</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.600" end="00:15:42.420" style="s2">you people piece is kind of interesting</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.640" end="00:15:44.490" style="s2">and it occurs to me that there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.420" end="00:15:47.190" style="s2">the way that one could do that just from</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.490" end="00:15:49.530" style="s2">first principles is if a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.190" end="00:15:52.050" style="s2">were to register themselves on a</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.530" end="00:15:54.180" style="s2">database or alternatively if you had</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.050" end="00:15:56.640" style="s2">Facebook you know if you if you had</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.180" end="00:15:58.230" style="s2">Facebook&#39;s data about people and people</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.640" end="00:16:00.900" style="s2">already on Facebook and you had their AI</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.230" end="00:16:04.860" style="s2">routines you&#39;d be able to characterize</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.900" end="00:16:07.140" style="s2">people categorize people and sort them</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.860" end="00:16:09.450" style="s2">into different categories so if you</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.140" end="00:16:11.220" style="s2">wanted to you could sort through if you</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.450" end="00:16:12.750" style="s2">had if you had the data that Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.220" end="00:16:14.370" style="s2">does about people about their the</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.750" end="00:16:15.480" style="s2">searches that they&#39;ve made and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.370" end="00:16:18.360" style="s2">information they&#39;ve registered about</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.480" end="00:16:20.670" style="s2">themselves online and the remarks that</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.360" end="00:16:22.170" style="s2">they that posted online and so on you</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.670" end="00:16:25.500" style="s2">have a tremendous amount of information</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.170" end="00:16:28.650" style="s2">about people as does for example the</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.500" end="00:16:33.450" style="s2">Google Corporation and to some extent so</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.650" end="00:16:35.640" style="s2">does for example Amazon now if you if</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.450" end="00:16:38.760" style="s2">any one of those corporations wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.640" end="00:16:41.160" style="s2">it could run some AI based routines to</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.760" end="00:16:43.440" style="s2">sift people and categorize them into</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.160" end="00:16:45.330" style="s2">subcategories and to different</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.440" end="00:16:47.970" style="s2">subcategories actually depending on what</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.330" end="00:16:49.560" style="s2">the search criteria were so you can for</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.970" end="00:16:51.720" style="s2">example to keep it really simple you</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.560" end="00:16:54.240" style="s2">could look for everybody who is that say</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.720" end="00:16:56.730" style="s2">between the ages of 40 and 50 female</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.240" end="00:16:59.700" style="s2">medical doctor and lives in the United</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.730" end="00:17:02.370" style="s2">States and then you could go further and</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.700" end="00:17:04.050" style="s2">you could say those people who you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.370" end="00:17:05.730" style="s2">those those women who are doctors</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.050" end="00:17:07.980" style="s2">between 40 to 45 live in the United</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.730" end="00:17:11.640" style="s2">States who have you know one or more</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.980" end="00:17:14.040" style="s2">children and who are republican-leaning</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.640" end="00:17:17.750" style="s2">politically you could easily do that</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.040" end="00:17:19.620" style="s2">okay now we don&#39;t have access to</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.750" end="00:17:21.539" style="s2">Facebook&#39;s data</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.620" end="00:17:23.100" style="s2">if we did and we could run those</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.539" end="00:17:24.689" style="s2">searches and we initially would have a</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.100" end="00:17:27.360" style="s2">bunch of categories with people who are</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.689" end="00:17:28.740" style="s2">demographically similar and we could run</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.360" end="00:17:30.299" style="s2">those searches according to different</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.740" end="00:17:32.549" style="s2">criteria and have different sub</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.299" end="00:17:35.909" style="s2">categories of people and then in</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.549" end="00:17:37.679" style="s2">principle we could sort of email those</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.909" end="00:17:39.059" style="s2">people or message those people and say</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.679" end="00:17:40.590" style="s2">hey would you like to get to know some</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.059" end="00:17:45.240" style="s2">people you have a lot in common with</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.590" end="00:17:47.820" style="s2">here&#39;s a database if you greenlight us</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.240" end="00:17:49.590" style="s2">to do so we will put you live on this</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.820" end="00:17:51.720" style="s2">database as somebody who could be</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.590" end="00:17:53.970" style="s2">contacted by the other people in this</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.720" end="00:17:57.350" style="s2">particular sub category in this example</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.970" end="00:17:57.350" style="s2">women between 40 and 40</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.490" end="00:18:02.770" style="s2">all right and then you could you know if</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.970" end="00:18:04.840" style="s2">you if you say yes then you get</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.770" end="00:18:07.210" style="s2">green-lighted and so do a bunch of other</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.840" end="00:18:08.919" style="s2">people I don&#39;t know 30% 40% of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.210" end="00:18:11.320" style="s2">people might might say yes I&#39;m willing</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.919" end="00:18:13.510" style="s2">to be a contact database and then they</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.320" end="00:18:15.880" style="s2">could contact each other and they might</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.510" end="00:18:16.630" style="s2">have a heck of a lot in common and what</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.880" end="00:18:18.039" style="s2">you&#39;re doing there of course is</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.630" end="00:18:20.289" style="s2">reinforcing an echo chamber just</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.039" end="00:18:22.570" style="s2">peripherally but nonetheless it could be</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.289" end="00:18:24.429" style="s2">an interesting thing to do and we are</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.570" end="00:18:29.890" style="s2">not Facebook and we don&#39;t have access to</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.429" end="00:18:32.049" style="s2">Facebook&#39;s data and unless we you know I</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.890" end="00:18:34.360" style="s2">guess came but Cambridge analytical that</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.049" end="00:18:35.830" style="s2">was able to buy Facebook&#39;s data at one</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.360" end="00:18:39.130" style="s2">point a few years ago that led to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.830" end="00:18:40.919" style="s2">scandal that that did occur because they</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.130" end="00:18:43.840" style="s2">use that to help mr. Chuck get elected</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.919" end="00:18:45.700" style="s2">but we were unlikely to be able to get</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.840" end="00:18:48.940" style="s2">that that data what we would have to do</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.700" end="00:18:53.590" style="s2">if we wanted to enable people to quote</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.940" end="00:18:56.140" style="s2">find their people we would have to ask</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.590" end="00:18:58.169" style="s2">people to register voluntarily on a</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.140" end="00:19:01.659" style="s2">database in which they characterized</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.169" end="00:19:03.700" style="s2">themselves and now I&#39;m gonna mention</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.659" end="00:19:07.419" style="s2">here that people when they characterize</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.700" end="00:19:09.029" style="s2">themselves there are two reasons why</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.419" end="00:19:12.760" style="s2">they may not characterize themselves</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.029" end="00:19:13.990" style="s2">accurately first they may be unaware of</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.760" end="00:19:17.980" style="s2">a whole bunch of their characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.990" end="00:19:19.779" style="s2">that may be salient and unaware in ways</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.980" end="00:19:22.029" style="s2">that the Facebook algorithms are not</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.779" end="00:19:23.890" style="s2">unaware Facebook and companies like that</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.029" end="00:19:25.630" style="s2">have so much information about us now</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.890" end="00:19:27.460" style="s2">that they can profile us in a way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.630" end="00:19:30.279" style="s2">much more accurate than our self</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.460" end="00:19:33.880" style="s2">perception in a lot of ways peripherally</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.279" end="00:19:35.080" style="s2">secondly they people might be not just</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.880" end="00:19:36.730" style="s2">unaware of some of their own</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.080" end="00:19:37.899" style="s2">characteristics that that doesn&#39;t occur</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.730" end="00:19:40.600" style="s2">to them to mention or that they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.899" end="00:19:42.309" style="s2">even aware of it all they also may have</p>

<p begin="00:19:47.440" end="00:19:53.350" style="s2">the kind of database and say I&#39;m willing</p>

<p begin="00:20:38.120" end="00:20:44.000" style="s2">of it I will also list some things that</p>

<p begin="00:20:56.870" end="00:21:03.850" style="s2">kind of voluntary database and people</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.799" end="00:21:06.200" style="s2">started self sorting into smaller groups</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.850" end="00:21:08.720" style="s2">then of course it&#39;s useful to have some</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.200" end="00:21:11.419" style="s2">kind of a an algorithm according which</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.720" end="00:21:16.010" style="s2">they self sort that might a pre</p>

<p begin="00:21:18.740" end="00:21:23.330" style="s2">may not want to impose a single unique</p>

<p begin="00:21:23.330" end="00:21:26.659" style="s2">but you might have some kind of a</p>

<p begin="00:21:37.159" end="00:21:41.809" style="s2">self-organization would be some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.710" end="00:21:44.120" style="s2">some version some flavor of fractal</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.809" end="00:21:45.919" style="s2">democracy where you have you know let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.120" end="00:21:50.120" style="s2">say groups of seven people teams of</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.919" end="00:21:52.640" style="s2">seven people get together and those</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.120" end="00:21:55.340" style="s2">seven people would it could be five</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.640" end="00:21:56.510" style="s2">people could be seven people but an odd</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.340" end="00:21:58.669" style="s2">numbered group of people get together</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.510" end="00:22:00.380" style="s2">get to know each other maybe through</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.669" end="00:22:03.080" style="s2">online conversations for a while and at</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.380" end="00:22:05.720" style="s2">some point elect a spokesperson and that</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.080" end="00:22:08.360" style="s2">spokesperson then becomes a delegate to</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.720" end="00:22:10.610" style="s2">the next level up of another group of</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.360" end="00:22:13.039" style="s2">seven people and interacts with those</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.610" end="00:22:14.990" style="s2">people and they choose a spokesperson</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.039" end="00:22:17.600" style="s2">and at some point that&#39;s you know the</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.990" end="00:22:19.399" style="s2">third level spokesperson in a group of</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.600" end="00:22:22.429" style="s2">seven people and so on which which</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.399" end="00:22:25.190" style="s2">allows you to build a hierarchy of</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.429" end="00:22:27.440" style="s2">elected people that you can coordinate</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.190" end="00:22:30.190" style="s2">with just a few levels of hierarchy many</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.440" end="00:22:33.320" style="s2">millions of people in common cause by</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.190" end="00:22:35.899" style="s2">going through this fractal process that</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.320" end="00:22:39.009" style="s2">I called fractal democracy that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.899" end="00:22:41.299" style="s2">possible model for self-organization so</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.009" end="00:22:45.049" style="s2">what it sounds like you guys are trying</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.299" end="00:22:46.909" style="s2">to do is create a technology or find a</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.049" end="00:22:49.220" style="s2">technology that may already exist maybe</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.909" end="00:22:51.649" style="s2">and spiral maybe it&#39;s micro Sol adara T</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.220" end="00:22:55.429" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s another one that would make</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.649" end="00:22:58.460" style="s2">it possible for as you put it for people</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.429" end="00:23:01.429" style="s2">to find their people first of all and to</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.460" end="00:23:04.460" style="s2">also find these people in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.429" end="00:23:05.989" style="s2">becomes effective not only people find</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.460" end="00:23:09.289" style="s2">people that I sort of like you in some</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.989" end="00:23:11.929" style="s2">way that that makes sense to you and to</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.289" end="00:23:13.759" style="s2">them but also people who want to work</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.929" end="00:23:18.249" style="s2">together on some particular project that</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.759" end="00:23:24.200" style="s2">want to you know create as a solutions</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.249" end="00:23:25.580" style="s2">team some kind and and maybe if I</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.200" end="00:23:31.029" style="s2">understand you correctly not this is a</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.580" end="00:23:33.320" style="s2">question are you thinking you know some</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.029" end="00:23:36.919" style="s2">teams to work together on a solution but</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.320" end="00:23:38.960" style="s2">also something that allows large numbers</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.919" end="00:23:41.269" style="s2">of small teams to work together on a</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.960" end="00:23:43.460" style="s2">solution or do you even have an idea</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.269" end="00:23:46.099" style="s2">that everybody involved all of this team</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.460" end="00:23:49.309" style="s2">of teams like everybody on I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.099" end="00:23:51.950" style="s2">Microsoft CC is then obliged to are</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.309" end="00:23:54.139" style="s2">asked to contribute to the same grand</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.950" end="00:23:59.479" style="s2">goal what is it you have in mind in that</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.139" end="00:24:00.799" style="s2">respect both so the idea I mean</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.479" end="00:24:02.149" style="s2">everything we&#39;re creating with the other</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.799" end="00:24:03.499" style="s2">tech will be from the ground up right</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.149" end="00:24:05.599" style="s2">when we have more people of like how do</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.499" end="00:24:09.950" style="s2">we fund it how do we but the vision is</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.599" end="00:24:12.080" style="s2">that there is a way we fund it and out</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.950" end="00:24:16.029" style="s2">of that pool of money we are creating</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.080" end="00:24:18.080" style="s2">technology that is better solutions so</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.029" end="00:24:20.359" style="s2">getting a bunch of people together to</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.080" end="00:24:23.629" style="s2">talk about what they&#39;re doing for food</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.359" end="00:24:25.220" style="s2">and then recreating a food system not</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.629" end="00:24:26.659" style="s2">from how do we get the seeds in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.220" end="00:24:28.519" style="s2">ground and get this food to people but</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.659" end="00:24:30.529" style="s2">like what are you doing and how can we</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.519" end="00:24:32.330" style="s2">incrementally improve it how can we both</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.529" end="00:24:34.639" style="s2">buy food together how can we have what I</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.330" end="00:24:37.759" style="s2">have it in community dinners eco housing</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.639" end="00:24:38.930" style="s2">how can so anytime anyone has has a</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.759" end="00:24:41.000" style="s2">problem or as</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.930" end="00:24:44.410" style="s2">solution they can bring it in workshop</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.000" end="00:24:46.640" style="s2">it and and yeah but what is what is that</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.410" end="00:24:49.550" style="s2">how many of these people supposing</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.640" end="00:24:53.710" style="s2">there&#39;s 100 million people network that</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.550" end="00:24:57.080" style="s2">you are using this tool like yes</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.710" end="00:24:58.940" style="s2">solutions by Christopher Garrity tool is</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.080" end="00:25:00.230" style="s2">a hundred million people on that there</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.940" end="00:25:02.180" style="s2">are going to be many many different</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.230" end="00:25:04.190" style="s2">people with many many different ideas of</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.180" end="00:25:05.210" style="s2">problems that they would like to solve</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.190" end="00:25:07.550" style="s2">you know there&#39;s gonna be somebody</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.210" end="00:25:09.980" style="s2">worried about I don&#39;t know the famine in</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.550" end="00:25:11.690" style="s2">southern Zimbabwe that as a result of</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.980" end="00:25:13.070" style="s2">several years of drought and they want</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.690" end="00:25:14.360" style="s2">to have solutions that somebody else is</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.070" end="00:25:15.860" style="s2">gonna be worried about you know how do</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.360" end="00:25:17.810" style="s2">we shut down coal-fired power plants</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.860" end="00:25:19.130" style="s2">another person is going to be worried</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.810" end="00:25:20.960" style="s2">about how do you you know design a</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.130" end="00:25:23.330" style="s2">better electric bicycle I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.960" end="00:25:25.010" style="s2">just lots of different things and I</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.330" end="00:25:27.020" style="s2">don&#39;t think you can actually grab</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.010" end="00:25:29.150" style="s2">everybody&#39;s attention on every one of</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.020" end="00:25:32.000" style="s2">those questions at the same time I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.150" end="00:25:34.700" style="s2">absolutely to have specialist groups</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.000" end="00:25:37.310" style="s2">that specialize in particular things but</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.700" end="00:25:39.620" style="s2">it sounds like you also want to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.310" end="00:25:41.660" style="s2">charge people a fee so that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.620" end="00:25:43.880" style="s2">you know some money collected that then</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.660" end="00:25:45.410" style="s2">gets to the top of this hierarchy and</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.880" end="00:25:47.360" style="s2">then at the top of how criticized how to</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.410" end="00:25:53.870" style="s2">spend it or what do you have in mind</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.360" end="00:25:56.240" style="s2">so Bentley jump in if you have answers</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.870" end="00:25:58.100" style="s2">to I think I know what you&#39;re gonna say</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.240" end="00:26:01.670" style="s2">so you you keep going if you get tired</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.100" end="00:26:03.770" style="s2">out something just tag so I I know I</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.670" end="00:26:06.530" style="s2">forgotten the question right funding it</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.770" end="00:26:09.620" style="s2">and then yes so the idea is that there</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.530" end="00:26:11.990" style="s2">is a huge number of people right who so</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.620" end="00:26:14.570" style="s2">it depends on what number of people and</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.990" end="00:26:16.070" style="s2">what we&#39;re trying to solve if we are</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.570" end="00:26:18.500" style="s2">starting with 10,000 people we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.070" end="00:26:20.210" style="s2">have the ability to dissipate that</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.500" end="00:26:22.310" style="s2">energy and create 10,000 different</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.210" end="00:26:23.660" style="s2">projects but if we add it whatever you</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.310" end="00:26:25.580" style="s2">set a hundred million people or 10</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.660" end="00:26:27.590" style="s2">million people then maybe we have enough</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.580" end="00:26:30.680" style="s2">energy to do 10 different projects right</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.590" end="00:26:31.910" style="s2">at a time and so create just creating</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.680" end="00:26:33.230" style="s2">the tools to be able to bring people</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.910" end="00:26:34.720" style="s2">together to talk about it what</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.230" end="00:26:37.220" style="s2">everything you just said right coal</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.720" end="00:26:39.650" style="s2">manufacturing and like your local city</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.220" end="00:26:42.410" style="s2">if you can bring people together who can</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.650" end="00:26:45.430" style="s2">talk about that then through that</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.410" end="00:26:48.080" style="s2">conversation you can generate ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.430" end="00:26:50.960" style="s2">with enough people having that you end</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.080" end="00:26:52.419" style="s2">the funding model being there then they</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.960" end="00:26:54.429" style="s2">already have the</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.419" end="00:26:56.259" style="s2">our they already have the money there to</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.429" end="00:26:57.789" style="s2">say hey look we have a million dollars</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.259" end="00:27:00.609" style="s2">sitting here that we can create</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.789" end="00:27:02.679" style="s2">something without requiring we do it</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.609" end="00:27:04.210" style="s2">individually and without requiring you</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.679" end="00:27:06.129" style="s2">leave it up which is also what I got</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.210" end="00:27:08.320" style="s2">from this micro solidarity they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.129" end="00:27:09.489" style="s2">big other them right like the government</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.320" end="00:27:11.529" style="s2">needs to solve this we need to pass</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.489" end="00:27:13.149" style="s2">carbon laws we need to or we</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.529" end="00:27:14.950" style="s2">individually need to do straws right</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.149" end="00:27:17.139" style="s2">stop using straws to start using bikes</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.950" end="00:27:20.259" style="s2">and there&#39;s this huge space in between</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.139" end="00:27:22.090" style="s2">which is actually where problems can and</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.259" end="00:27:24.009" style="s2">should be solved where it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.090" end="00:27:26.230" style="s2">demanding people have laws that are</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.009" end="00:27:27.940" style="s2">hierarchy down and not demanding we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.230" end="00:27:30.580" style="s2">all on her own and so creating the tools</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.940" end="00:27:31.899" style="s2">to facilitate that process yeah yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.580" end="00:27:33.580" style="s2">trying to understand those something</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.899" end="00:27:35.289" style="s2">like if you&#39;re trying to solve a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.580" end="00:27:36.940" style="s2">of you know a smaller number of problems</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.289" end="00:27:38.019" style="s2">if you have a larger number a smaller</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.940" end="00:27:39.879" style="s2">number of people a larger number</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.019" end="00:27:42.820" style="s2">problems yeah sure sure</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.879" end="00:27:45.639" style="s2">but who decides which problems number</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.820" end="00:27:47.679" style="s2">one okay and number two is your</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.639" end="00:27:49.359" style="s2">financial model here that but yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.679" end="00:27:51.100" style="s2">you have to pay I don&#39;t know a monthly</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.359" end="00:27:53.200" style="s2">fee or something to be part of this</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.100" end="00:27:56.109" style="s2">network and this money is then pooled</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.200" end="00:27:57.789" style="s2">and then the question is of course who</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.109" end="00:27:59.139" style="s2">decides how the money gets spent it</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.789" end="00:28:01.090" style="s2">seems to me that you&#39;re interested in</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.139" end="00:28:02.830" style="s2">this fact well fractional democracy idea</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.090" end="00:28:04.269" style="s2">because you&#39;re thinking maybe that the</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.830" end="00:28:06.609" style="s2">people at the top of the photo the</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.269" end="00:28:08.830" style="s2">fractal democracy representative chain</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.609" end="00:28:11.279" style="s2">are the ones who then would decide how</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.830" end="00:28:13.840" style="s2">the money is allocated is that correct</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.279" end="00:28:15.549" style="s2">when we had the conversation on fractal</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.840" end="00:28:19.419" style="s2">democracy when I&#39;d first read the</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.549" end="00:28:22.539" style="s2">article the emerging financial structure</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.419" end="00:28:23.859" style="s2">was that yes people would pay in $10 a</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.539" end="00:28:24.970" style="s2">month which is always kind of a number</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.859" end="00:28:26.529" style="s2">that&#39;s stuck in my head because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.970" end="00:28:28.090" style="s2">around what Netflix is and the ideas</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.529" end="00:28:29.379" style="s2">were creating the Netflix of apps we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.090" end="00:28:31.149" style="s2">creating all this technology you think</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.379" end="00:28:33.609" style="s2">it&#39;s your life better you come onboard</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.149" end="00:28:35.409" style="s2">when ten dollars makes sense to you so</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.609" end="00:28:36.489" style="s2">right now ten dollars to make sense the</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.409" end="00:28:38.109" style="s2">Bentley and Ikes who want to create a</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.489" end="00:28:39.369" style="s2">better world there&#39;s no technology we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.109" end="00:28:41.470" style="s2">not getting anything for it besides</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.369" end="00:28:43.059" style="s2">getting to show up and do this which is</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.470" end="00:28:45.309" style="s2">awesome but it&#39;s the only maybe not</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.059" end="00:28:47.409" style="s2">worth it to someone else who needs it to</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.309" end="00:28:50.080" style="s2">feed them get their finances or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.409" end="00:28:51.129" style="s2">their their issue is so and I forgot</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.080" end="00:28:53.580" style="s2">what answer your question I was</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.129" end="00:28:57.009" style="s2">answering my brain is clearly</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.580" end="00:29:03.129" style="s2">Jubilee if I could cook them and so I</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.009" end="00:29:05.950" style="s2">you know we have these things that we</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.129" end="00:29:08.260" style="s2">want to go towards right so we</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.950" end="00:29:10.210" style="s2">want everyone to be involved that wants</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.260" end="00:29:13.330" style="s2">to be we want them to be free to do what</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.210" end="00:29:15.730" style="s2">they want so when you&#39;re asking the</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.330" end="00:29:18.370" style="s2">specifics we&#39;re not to that point yet</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.730" end="00:29:22.360" style="s2">and those specifics will change as the</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.370" end="00:29:25.149" style="s2">community matures over time so I I</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.360" end="00:29:27.340" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t even start worrying about how</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.149" end="00:29:29.580" style="s2">we&#39;re going to vide up you know a</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.340" end="00:29:33.399" style="s2">thousand projects to ten thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.580" end="00:29:35.080" style="s2">until we&#39;re closer to that point because</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.399" end="00:29:36.880" style="s2">whatever we decide to do will be an</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.080" end="00:29:38.409" style="s2">experiment and we&#39;ll iterate on it so I</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.880" end="00:29:40.570" style="s2">can&#39;t say what that final solution is</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.409" end="00:29:42.519" style="s2">going to be so we&#39;re really just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.570" end="00:29:45.100" style="s2">like setting a goal and a path and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.519" end="00:29:46.870" style="s2">starting to experiment our goal is not</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.100" end="00:29:51.190" style="s2">to have a central group of people</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.870" end="00:29:53.260" style="s2">distribute the funds so we&#39;ll be looking</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.190" end="00:29:56.350" style="s2">at a lot of different ways that that can</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.260" end="00:29:58.120" style="s2">be done equitably and and fairly and and</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.350" end="00:30:01.899" style="s2">to the you know desires of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.120" end="00:30:03.399" style="s2">participants but that&#39;s that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.899" end="00:30:05.769" style="s2">things we need to discuss and that we</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.399" end="00:30:08.649" style="s2">would like those people to come in and</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.769" end="00:30:10.929" style="s2">help us figure out and decide how we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.649" end="00:30:12.730" style="s2">going to do that as a community but the</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.929" end="00:30:14.649" style="s2">idea is that there would be some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.730" end="00:30:16.899" style="s2">funding model contributed by everybody</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.649" end="00:30:18.549" style="s2">and those funds would be distributed in</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.899" end="00:30:22.090" style="s2">some sort of fair fashion and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.549" end="00:30:23.649" style="s2">lots of options on how to do that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.090" end="00:30:27.070" style="s2">and a big part of it also is like</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.649" end="00:30:28.840" style="s2">whatever size for in people are able to</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.070" end="00:30:30.100" style="s2">give feedback in what&#39;s working and not</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.840" end="00:30:32.860" style="s2">working for them</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.100" end="00:30:34.269" style="s2">so if $10 so you&#39;re paying $10 a month</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.860" end="00:30:35.350" style="s2">then we&#39;re not focusing on the thing</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.269" end="00:30:37.360" style="s2">you&#39;re here to solve</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.350" end="00:30:38.529" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna leave but if you tell us</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.360" end="00:30:40.059" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna leave and other people like</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.529" end="00:30:42.279" style="s2">yeah they&#39;re not focusing on food and I</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.059" end="00:30:44.350" style="s2">really won&#39;t here for food that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.279" end="00:30:46.720" style="s2">of automatically an attractor to be like</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.350" end="00:30:48.580" style="s2">oh yeah let&#39;s have that be now if your</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.720" end="00:30:50.440" style="s2">thing is so fringe that nobody wants to</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.580" end="00:30:52.240" style="s2">that&#39;s the only reason you&#39;re there this</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.440" end="00:30:53.769" style="s2">probably isn&#39;t an attractor for you and</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.240" end="00:30:56.110" style="s2">you might come realize that it leave</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.769" end="00:30:58.779" style="s2">it&#39;s not like we have to keep everyone</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.110" end="00:31:01.179" style="s2">but we also don&#39;t want to dissipate the</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.779" end="00:31:06.159" style="s2">energies we want to have it be</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.179" end="00:31:08.559" style="s2">Invitational I see so it&#39;s it really</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.159" end="00:31:11.649" style="s2">does sound like you&#39;re rigorously trying</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.559" end="00:31:16.659" style="s2">to develop a an online platform and</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.649" end="00:31:19.600" style="s2">financial aggregator of some kind to</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.659" end="00:31:23.410" style="s2">instantiate working</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.600" end="00:31:25.210" style="s2">and urk ISM yeah I&#39;d be careful with the</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.410" end="00:31:27.700" style="s2">anarchism term because a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.210" end="00:31:30.820" style="s2">see that as anti-government even though</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.700" end="00:31:33.880" style="s2">I I imagine your term you know your use</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.820" end="00:31:38.919" style="s2">of it is is more the side of rejecting</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.880" end="00:31:42.340" style="s2">hierarchies which you know in the end is</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.919" end="00:31:45.100" style="s2">anti-government but I&#39;m not an anarchist</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.340" end="00:31:47.710" style="s2">at all personally but I I do know people</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.100" end="00:31:49.360" style="s2">who you know are into it and what</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.710" end="00:31:51.010" style="s2">they&#39;re not talking just they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.360" end="00:31:52.510" style="s2">I don&#39;t think mostly so much</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.010" end="00:31:55.150" style="s2">anti-government as you correctly point</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.510" end="00:31:58.570" style="s2">out as they had this idea that nobody</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.150" end="00:32:00.250" style="s2">should ever have to be coerced in</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.570" end="00:32:01.780" style="s2">anything everything they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.250" end="00:32:03.130" style="s2">like libertarians you know they have</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.780" end="00:32:05.350" style="s2">this idea that everything should just be</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.130" end="00:32:07.840" style="s2">a voluntary Association and if there is</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.350" end="00:32:09.669" style="s2">a decision to be made you know the only</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.840" end="00:32:11.020" style="s2">difference maybe between the libertarian</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.669" end="00:32:13.840" style="s2">and an anarchist I think is the</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.020" end="00:32:15.789" style="s2">libertarian doesn&#39;t even seem to really</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.840" end="00:32:19.030" style="s2">have anything other than the idea of a</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.789" end="00:32:21.460" style="s2">bilateral deal marketplace deal in mind</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.030" end="00:32:23.020" style="s2">whereas the anarchist maybe wants to</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.460" end="00:32:25.600" style="s2">create kind of some sort of a social</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.020" end="00:32:27.340" style="s2">technology which allows participative</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.600" end="00:32:29.140" style="s2">decision-making but otherwise is</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.340" end="00:32:31.840" style="s2">completely free always of any coercion</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.140" end="00:32:32.860" style="s2">whatsoever which is the reason that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.840" end="00:32:34.480" style="s2">thinking that this sounds more like</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.860" end="00:32:39.309" style="s2">anarchism in that sense and not like</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.480" end="00:32:41.830" style="s2">libertarianism yeah yeah I kind of agree</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.309" end="00:32:44.590" style="s2">with that I I think though that a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.830" end="00:32:46.570" style="s2">people would misunderstand the term</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.590" end="00:32:49.299" style="s2">anarchy</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.570" end="00:32:54.610" style="s2">so I would rather use different language</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.299" end="00:32:58.120" style="s2">to describe it kind of like their</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.610" end="00:33:00.580" style="s2">cooperative know where everyone does</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.120" end="00:33:01.980" style="s2">have a say in it I don&#39;t know that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.580" end="00:33:04.059" style="s2">kind of worked out that wording</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.980" end="00:33:06.039" style="s2">unfortunately there&#39;s language is a big</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.059" end="00:33:08.230" style="s2">issue in everything it&#39;s either like am</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.039" end="00:33:09.640" style="s2">a language they are like bringing in or</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.230" end="00:33:11.640" style="s2">you to create a new one and then people</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.640" end="00:33:13.990" style="s2">need to know what it means and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.640" end="00:33:15.820" style="s2">that&#39;s what kind of longer description</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.990" end="00:33:17.710" style="s2">than we&#39;d like it to have so we were you</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.820" end="00:33:20.500" style="s2">know but I think if we just say you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.710" end="00:33:22.960" style="s2">like some things were pointing out by</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.500" end="00:33:24.039" style="s2">everybody for everybody for tech when</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.960" end="00:33:26.169" style="s2">we&#39;re focusing on attack more than</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.039" end="00:33:27.790" style="s2">solutions and I&#39;m kind of liking the</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.169" end="00:33:29.820" style="s2">idea of a solution accelerate alright</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.790" end="00:33:33.179" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t get to your question about</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.820" end="00:33:33.179" style="s2">describing the</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.320" end="00:33:38.780" style="s2">describing that that kind of focus but</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.710" end="00:33:40.550" style="s2">but yeah I think we need to workshop</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.780" end="00:33:43.370" style="s2">those words but I take your meaning</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.550" end="00:33:49.000" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re not swirling what does one</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.370" end="00:33:49.000" style="s2">fit into the whole la crisi realm I</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.750" end="00:33:56.360" style="s2">think so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.710" end="00:33:58.070" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of a circles and groups of</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.360" end="00:34:01.370" style="s2">people that are choosing which projects</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.070" end="00:34:03.350" style="s2">to work on right yeah that&#39;s fine I</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.370" end="00:34:05.930" style="s2">understand that yeah so it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.350" end="00:34:08.660" style="s2">philosophically similar to halakha see</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.930" end="00:34:10.429" style="s2">yeah so that does need to be some kind</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.660" end="00:34:12.919" style="s2">of a process for people to make</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.429" end="00:34:14.870" style="s2">decisions or multiple processes it</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.919" end="00:34:17.179" style="s2">sounds like you&#39;re being very rigorous</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.870" end="00:34:19.130" style="s2">about not making any decisions in</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.179" end="00:34:20.900" style="s2">advance without having everybody come</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.130" end="00:34:22.550" style="s2">together and make the decision together</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.900" end="00:34:24.020" style="s2">but if you don&#39;t have a process for</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.550" end="00:34:25.730" style="s2">everybody to come together and make the</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.020" end="00:34:30.370" style="s2">decision together it&#39;s like you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.730" end="00:34:33.260" style="s2">you&#39;re in a vicious circle so how do you</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.370" end="00:34:36.350" style="s2">imagine at least the first iteration</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.260" end="00:34:37.760" style="s2">works that if you got everybody all not</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.350" end="00:34:40.640" style="s2">if you got a whole bunch of people to</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.760" end="00:34:43.550" style="s2">get on to a database together describe</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.640" end="00:34:44.870" style="s2">themselves describe solutions or</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.550" end="00:34:46.840" style="s2">problems that they&#39;re interested in</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.870" end="00:34:49.100" style="s2">contributing towards the solution of and</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.840" end="00:34:51.620" style="s2">you know be able to search the database</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.100" end="00:34:53.360" style="s2">maybe to find people of birds of a</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.620" end="00:34:55.280" style="s2">feather equally they might share</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.360" end="00:34:57.440" style="s2">priorities with interests with</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.280" end="00:35:00.500" style="s2">characteristics with supposing you had</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.440" end="00:35:05.300" style="s2">all of that do you have any type of idea</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.500" end="00:35:08.780" style="s2">so far how these people might decide to</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.300" end="00:35:12.920" style="s2">you know how they might make decisions</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.780" end="00:35:17.570" style="s2">together about something can I quickly</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.920" end="00:35:19.310" style="s2">try to steal man you too or like say my</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.570" end="00:35:24.890" style="s2">perspective on whether I understand you</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.310" end="00:35:29.050" style="s2">and symptom may be a spa so if I</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.890" end="00:35:32.420" style="s2">understand you correctly you would um</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.050" end="00:35:34.910" style="s2">try to have groups come come together</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.420" end="00:35:36.350" style="s2">people come together and then make the</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.910" end="00:35:41.390" style="s2">decisions for themselves so the</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.350" end="00:35:45.619" style="s2">differentiation there is you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.390" end="00:35:49.730" style="s2">to impose any kind of decisions on two</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.619" end="00:35:53.119" style="s2">groups you would always try to just make</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.730" end="00:35:55.940" style="s2">them come together let the people who</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.119" end="00:36:01.160" style="s2">are involved how many people that will</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.940" end="00:36:03.319" style="s2">be beep five ten ten thousand or so try</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.160" end="00:36:08.059" style="s2">them to have the decision together</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.319" end="00:36:10.549" style="s2">um it&#39;s yeah instead of having someone</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.059" end="00:36:12.920" style="s2">impose from the top and then from these</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.549" end="00:36:19.010" style="s2">circles where those decisions come out</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.920" end="00:36:25.369" style="s2">from instead of into you would build up</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.010" end="00:36:29.809" style="s2">the project um is that who&#39;s the you</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.369" end="00:36:31.430" style="s2">that you&#39;re I&#39;m just I was asking these</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.809" end="00:36:34.369" style="s2">questions because I&#39;m trying to get a</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.430" end="00:36:37.099" style="s2">sense of where Jubilee and Bentley are</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.369" end="00:36:39.680" style="s2">at and what they imagine and my question</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.099" end="00:36:41.539" style="s2">essentially I&#39;m assuming the hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.680" end="00:36:42.890" style="s2">that there&#39;s a database of people that</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.539" end="00:36:44.630" style="s2">have volunteered some information about</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.890" end="00:36:46.309" style="s2">themselves and has said you know we want</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.630" end="00:36:47.599" style="s2">to be part of this in some way and that</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.309" end="00:36:49.339" style="s2">have also said you know here are their</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.599" end="00:36:51.559" style="s2">sort of grand challenges or problems</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.339" end="00:36:53.240" style="s2">that I&#39;m interested in and yes I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.559" end="00:36:55.130" style="s2">willing to contribute $10 a month and so</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.240" end="00:36:59.299" style="s2">you&#39;ve got that and the question is</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.130" end="00:37:01.640" style="s2">what&#39;s the decision procedure for moving</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.299" end="00:37:05.599" style="s2">forward from that place and my my claim</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.640" end="00:37:07.490" style="s2">would be as sort of a math isolate</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.599" end="00:37:09.349" style="s2">applied math and physics as an undergrad</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.490" end="00:37:12.769" style="s2">I have a master&#39;s in management so I</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.349" end="00:37:15.640" style="s2">think I&#39;m a very pragmatic person and</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.769" end="00:37:18.140" style="s2">and I think in in terms of you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.640" end="00:37:19.849" style="s2">useful questions like how do we do this</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.140" end="00:37:22.609" style="s2">I think and so I think there has to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.849" end="00:37:26.450" style="s2">an initial hypothesis that the</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.609" end="00:37:29.390" style="s2">organizers will have to initially put in</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.450" end="00:37:31.190" style="s2">place that allows people to make a</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.390" end="00:37:33.500" style="s2">decision together otherwise you get</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.190" end="00:37:35.420" style="s2">Occupy Wall Street that was incapable of</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.500" end="00:37:37.369" style="s2">doing anything because they never could</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.420" end="00:37:38.990" style="s2">actually make a decision together they</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.369" end="00:37:40.730" style="s2">could just have people stand up and rant</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.990" end="00:37:42.950" style="s2">into the microphone but they refused</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.730" end="00:37:45.710" style="s2">even to create a process for making a</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.950" end="00:37:47.150" style="s2">decision a majority decision as far as I</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.710" end="00:37:49.069" style="s2">understand it wasn&#39;t there I just got</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.150" end="00:37:51.349" style="s2">the impression that that that was the</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.069" end="00:37:52.970" style="s2">case so if you&#39;re too extremist about</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.349" end="00:37:54.950" style="s2">this anarchistic principle where you</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.970" end="00:37:56.630" style="s2">won&#39;t even impose an initial heck</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.950" end="00:37:58.579" style="s2">offices about how the group can come to</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.630" end="00:38:00.380" style="s2">a decision then I think the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.579" end="00:38:02.390" style="s2">is destined to fail but that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.380" end="00:38:04.460" style="s2">just so that&#39;s my challenging question</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.390" end="00:38:06.050" style="s2">yeah you guys can tell me Bentley and</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.460" end="00:38:09.500" style="s2">Jubilee whether I&#39;m completely off-base</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.050" end="00:38:11.750" style="s2">I mean can I tackle eligibly first thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.500" end="00:38:14.150" style="s2">Jones I think your description is very</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.750" end="00:38:16.430" style="s2">close to one of the options of how we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.150" end="00:38:18.650" style="s2">doing this and Jasper your point about</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.430" end="00:38:20.690" style="s2">not having any solid footing and nothing</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.650" end="00:38:25.640" style="s2">could ever come of that is accurate</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.690" end="00:38:27.500" style="s2">both Jubilee and I have had concepts on</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.640" end="00:38:32.150" style="s2">how to pull something like this together</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.500" end="00:38:33.440" style="s2">and we had you know a set I did I think</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.150" end="00:38:34.910" style="s2">and I think Jubilee had this to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.440" end="00:38:38.720" style="s2">set of rules and this is how we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.910" end="00:38:41.599" style="s2">to do it so we pulled back just a little</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.720" end="00:38:44.839" style="s2">bit from that so we still have our ideas</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.599" end="00:38:47.869" style="s2">what I and Jubilee wrote we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.839" end="00:38:49.400" style="s2">discussed this point yet so really what</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.869" end="00:38:51.230" style="s2">we&#39;re getting together is in public</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.400" end="00:38:52.369" style="s2">we&#39;re discussing this and finding out</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.230" end="00:38:54.230" style="s2">how to get there and if it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.369" end="00:38:56.119" style="s2">jubilant Jubilee and I come and do and</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.230" end="00:38:58.820" style="s2">kind of setting up here&#39;s our vision and</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.119" end="00:39:02.780" style="s2">invite people in and say okay we can</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.820" end="00:39:04.700" style="s2">change it but we both kind of loosened</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.780" end="00:39:06.710" style="s2">up on our designs for a little bit and</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.700" end="00:39:10.339" style="s2">what I think we would like to do going</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.710" end="00:39:13.339" style="s2">forward is actually just get you know a</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.339" end="00:39:15.650" style="s2">good usability study tends to have like</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.339" end="00:39:18.440" style="s2">you know you know five to ten</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.650" end="00:39:19.700" style="s2">participants and after that level when</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.440" end="00:39:20.900" style="s2">you go through and do usability study</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.700" end="00:39:24.740" style="s2">and how many people there&#39;s diminishing</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.900" end="00:39:29.690" style="s2">returns on adding additional people in</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.740" end="00:39:31.730" style="s2">most cases so one one option that I</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.690" end="00:39:33.319" style="s2">don&#39;t think we&#39;ve been discussed is you</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.730" end="00:39:38.150" style="s2">know if we can get this little meeting</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.319" end="00:39:42.619" style="s2">to five six seven people who just say</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.150" end="00:39:44.300" style="s2">hey I want to be more effective in and</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.619" end="00:39:45.950" style="s2">the value that are bringing to the world</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.300" end="00:39:48.770" style="s2">and I want to help other people do that</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.950" end="00:39:50.390" style="s2">then I think Jubilee and I would work</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.770" end="00:39:52.220" style="s2">with those people we would and put our</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.390" end="00:39:53.750" style="s2">ideas and their ideas and we would kind</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.220" end="00:39:57.050" style="s2">of come to a consensus of the group</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.750" end="00:39:59.630" style="s2">still keep it loose but or at least</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.050" end="00:40:02.780" style="s2">flexible and then then we would have</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.630" end="00:40:05.210" style="s2">kind of here&#39;s more concrete vision but</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.780" end="00:40:07.849" style="s2">both Jubilees and I had very concrete</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.210" end="00:40:08.600" style="s2">visions before so I don&#39;t think the</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.849" end="00:40:11.780" style="s2">problem is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.600" end="00:40:13.490" style="s2">being to anarchist a we&#39;re just fighting</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.780" end="00:40:16.340" style="s2">against our natural tendencies right now</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.490" end="00:40:17.930" style="s2">I understand okay well of course I would</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.340" end="00:40:21.050" style="s2">be interested in hearing both of what</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.930" end="00:40:22.670" style="s2">you had in mind</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.050" end="00:40:28.010" style="s2">insofar as it&#39;s still valid or maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.670" end="00:40:31.430" style="s2">change your mind since my me personally</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.010" end="00:40:32.930" style="s2">I figured out in my mind all of it how</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.430" end="00:40:34.820" style="s2">we finance it how we get people together</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.930" end="00:40:36.500" style="s2">every piece of it breaks and you</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.820" end="00:40:38.720" style="s2">actually put it in the world and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.500" end="00:40:42.260" style="s2">not about having I had to get to that</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.720" end="00:40:44.180" style="s2">point to have enough faith to like step</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.260" end="00:40:45.860" style="s2">out into the world and try I was like oh</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.180" end="00:40:47.870" style="s2">my god I&#39;m holding the like solution to</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.860" end="00:40:50.000" style="s2">the world and so that I could like step</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.870" end="00:40:52.970" style="s2">into it to let it all fall apart and be</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.000" end="00:40:54.890" style="s2">like oh we need to create this otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.970" end="00:40:56.360" style="s2">you have to sell it and I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.890" end="00:40:57.470" style="s2">sell it I want to create it I want the</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.360" end="00:40:59.540" style="s2">passion to be there I don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.470" end="00:41:02.150" style="s2">in charge of this idea I want to be Elon</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.540" end="00:41:03.710" style="s2">Musk I want to be surrendered leadership</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.150" end="00:41:05.540" style="s2">and like how do we create that together</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.710" end="00:41:07.730" style="s2">and they&#39;ll like personal process of</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.540" end="00:41:10.550" style="s2">doing that and the group process of</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.730" end="00:41:14.180" style="s2">doing that and that is what we are doing</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.550" end="00:41:16.730" style="s2">and I have an answer a answer for almost</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.180" end="00:41:18.590" style="s2">all of it but it&#39;s one answer and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.730" end="00:41:20.060" style="s2">any table that I&#39;m part of it were</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.590" end="00:41:21.980" style="s2">discussing it I will bring that answer</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.060" end="00:41:24.230" style="s2">to the table and we can improve it or</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.980" end="00:41:27.470" style="s2">it&#39;s thrown out and someone else&#39;s ideas</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.230" end="00:41:29.570" style="s2">better right like the idea is that in a</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.470" end="00:41:31.310" style="s2">group we are smarter and we have more</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.570" end="00:41:35.720" style="s2">ideas and the more willing to do this</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.310" end="00:41:37.760" style="s2">process out in public the better is what</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.720" end="00:41:39.620" style="s2">I got going so one of the concepts which</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.760" end="00:41:41.420" style="s2">I think was mostly Jubilee is what we</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.620" end="00:41:44.720" style="s2">have kind of an idea cafe and this one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.420" end="00:41:46.280" style="s2">very loose still but where we have a</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.720" end="00:41:48.560" style="s2">scheduling system that allows people to</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.280" end="00:41:51.710" style="s2">just say hey I&#39;m willing to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.560" end="00:41:55.640" style="s2">solving the world&#39;s problems solving our</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.710" end="00:41:57.260" style="s2">world&#39;s problems and the system would</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.640" end="00:41:59.000" style="s2">randomly match people in groups they&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.260" end="00:42:00.260" style="s2">have discussions and then we hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.000" end="00:42:01.550" style="s2">quite figured out how we&#39;re gonna roll</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.260" end="00:42:03.170" style="s2">up the information there&#39;s several</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.550" end="00:42:06.590" style="s2">processes where you could then have</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.170" end="00:42:08.930" style="s2">representatives meet or just if you have</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.590" end="00:42:10.910" style="s2">enough groups meeting together and</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.930" end="00:42:13.550" style="s2">enough overlap between the groups over a</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.910" end="00:42:15.170" style="s2">period of time then theoretically the</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.550" end="00:42:17.600" style="s2">good ideas would kind of float up to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.170" end="00:42:19.070" style="s2">top and then the group could propose</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.600" end="00:42:22.170" style="s2">solutions and there&#39;s a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.070" end="00:42:24.930" style="s2">tools for kind of voting on those and</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.170" end="00:42:26.640" style="s2">stuff like that I&#39;ve been working for</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.930" end="00:42:31.860" style="s2">less over years on a tool that allows</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.640" end="00:42:34.170" style="s2">people to use facts and reasons to make</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.860" end="00:42:38.550" style="s2">decisions as opposed to more of an</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.170" end="00:42:39.960" style="s2">emotional stance called reason score so</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.550" end="00:42:44.220" style="s2">I&#39;m hoping that that tool would be a</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.960" end="00:42:47.100" style="s2">value to this group but we&#39;ll see how it</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.220" end="00:42:49.350" style="s2">goes it&#39;s not done yet so I can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.100" end="00:42:50.730" style="s2">put it out there too strongly but</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.350" end="00:42:53.430" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of there&#39;s lots of options</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.730" end="00:42:56.190" style="s2">to try so I think if we didn&#39;t get just</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.430" end="00:42:58.290" style="s2">a few more people to brainstorm with us</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.190" end="00:43:01.290" style="s2">on those in and then start proposing</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.290" end="00:43:03.900" style="s2">some rules and maybe even clearly state</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.290" end="00:43:06.570" style="s2">that those use a different word that</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.900" end="00:43:07.920" style="s2">rule maybe even aspiration and say yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.570" end="00:43:09.600" style="s2">this is what we&#39;re proposing to the</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.920" end="00:43:12.210" style="s2">world and then we kind of share that</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.600" end="00:43:15.630" style="s2">more and then get more feedback and suck</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.210" end="00:43:18.600" style="s2">people in through mind control then yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.630" end="00:43:22.740" style="s2">I think we&#39;re just earlier in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.600" end="00:43:24.470" style="s2">process than you would like how long</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.740" end="00:43:27.030" style="s2">have you guys been talking about this</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.470" end="00:43:28.110" style="s2">I&#39;ve been working on my fitness like</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.030" end="00:43:30.420" style="s2">he&#39;s been doing it for four years for</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.110" end="00:43:34.110" style="s2">about three and a half four years we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.420" end="00:43:36.150" style="s2">been meeting for a couple months yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.110" end="00:43:40.230" style="s2">let&#39;s just like once a week for an hour</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.150" end="00:43:43.200" style="s2">so you can see we&#39;ve yeah yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.230" end="00:43:44.520" style="s2">yeah I mean we think about it on the</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.200" end="00:43:47.310" style="s2">side and stuff and some of the things</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.520" end="00:43:49.350" style="s2">but but it&#39;s interesting when you</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.310" end="00:43:51.210" style="s2">introduce a new person how much of your</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.350" end="00:43:55.350" style="s2">ideas kind of break and you after we</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.210" end="00:43:57.090" style="s2">think everything so it&#39;s a very it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.350" end="00:43:58.830" style="s2">very deep process that takes some time</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.090" end="00:44:02.190" style="s2">but yeah we could definitely go faster</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.830" end="00:44:05.370" style="s2">but Jubilee has a child and I you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.190" end="00:44:08.250" style="s2">this part-time job so we&#39;re yeah we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.370" end="00:44:10.260" style="s2">so we&#39;re taking it slow it&#39;s more of a</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.250" end="00:44:13.250" style="s2">hobby at this point and the more people</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.260" end="00:44:15.600" style="s2">join like there&#39;s also the piece of</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.250" end="00:44:18.300" style="s2">their skills that Brentley and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.600" end="00:44:20.340" style="s2">have between us and so even like the</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.300" end="00:44:22.740" style="s2">admin på if someone came on board and</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.340" end="00:44:24.330" style="s2">took on the mid piece that would be huge</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.740" end="00:44:27.510" style="s2">and able to move us forward we&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.330" end="00:44:28.980" style="s2">this is you know um I&#39;m never gonna</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.510" end="00:44:31.560" style="s2">write out the white page for this thing</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.980" end="00:44:33.060" style="s2">it&#39;s not within my skill set someone can</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.560" end="00:44:35.040" style="s2">write they can take that idea and</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.060" end="00:44:36.990" style="s2">actually write it out in and understand</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.040" end="00:44:40.020" style="s2">format in like you know a ten page</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.990" end="00:44:42.090" style="s2">document how great that we&#39;re not there</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.020" end="00:44:43.950" style="s2">until that person comes on board cuz</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.090" end="00:44:45.540" style="s2">then they&#39;re part of creating it so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.950" end="00:44:47.820" style="s2">gonna be a lot easier for them to write</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.540" end="00:44:49.020" style="s2">that to write it out so that it can be</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.820" end="00:44:52.290" style="s2">candid easily but there&#39;s a good chance</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.020" end="00:44:53.760" style="s2">that no that we may not have enough may</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.290" end="00:44:55.590" style="s2">not be solid enough for anyone to really</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.760" end="00:44:58.770" style="s2">join a Jubilees who would i will have to</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.590" end="00:45:02.700" style="s2">spend time or get it get it more solid</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.770" end="00:45:04.230" style="s2">and then some people may join or we</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.700" end="00:45:06.750" style="s2">might just find another organization</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.230" end="00:45:08.520" style="s2">like you know microsoft are they already</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.750" end="00:45:11.910" style="s2">doing the same thing and just join them</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.520" end="00:45:14.580" style="s2">so okay I&#39;m silly and find like you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.910" end="00:45:15.900" style="s2">a group of people to become a I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.580" end="00:45:20.040" style="s2">know but there&#39;s it&#39;s called transitions</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.900" end="00:45:21.840" style="s2">it&#39;s called pods and there&#39;s a lot here</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.040" end="00:45:23.190" style="s2">like everything is chicken-and-egg</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.840" end="00:45:24.330" style="s2">everything&#39;s like well if we had this</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.190" end="00:45:25.500" style="s2">tool then we could create all these</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.330" end="00:45:26.790" style="s2">tools if we had the way to communicate</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.500" end="00:45:29.760" style="s2">if we had a way that couldn&#39;t have a</p>

<p begin="00:45:29.760" end="00:45:35.400" style="s2">extremely frustrating but also the power</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.210" end="00:45:36.870" style="s2">lies in that cuz once we get started</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.400" end="00:45:38.550" style="s2">once we like kind of figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.870" end="00:45:41.400" style="s2">work with a hundred people it&#39;s a much</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.550" end="00:45:42.960" style="s2">easier to exponentially grow that but</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.400" end="00:45:44.250" style="s2">you can&#39;t really figure out how to work</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.960" end="00:45:46.680" style="s2">with a hundred people until you have a</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.250" end="00:45:48.360" style="s2">hundred people you so right now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.680" end="00:45:49.770" style="s2">figuring out how to work on a five per</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.360" end="00:45:52.380" style="s2">you know how to get five people and work</p>

<p begin="00:47:04.229" end="00:47:09.900" style="s2">some people know about this and one of</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.599" end="00:47:13.499" style="s2">the things we know is that we grew up as</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.900" end="00:47:17.130" style="s2">a species and we involved as a species</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.499" end="00:47:21.390" style="s2">in southern Africa probably in what is</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.130" end="00:47:24.689" style="s2">now in northeast Botswana and Southwest</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.390" end="00:47:26.969" style="s2">Zimbabwe region as in as</p>

<p begin="00:47:29.849" end="00:47:35.099" style="s2">groups were these bands that were maybe</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.579" end="00:47:38.819" style="s2">at most an affiliate group of a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.099" end="00:47:40.679" style="s2">people or so 150 at absolute maximum but</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.819" end="00:47:43.919" style="s2">more like usually only a few dozen</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.679" end="00:47:46.049" style="s2">people and even within that you knew</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.919" end="00:47:49.739" style="s2">some quite a bit better than others and</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.049" end="00:47:52.140" style="s2">and so the ability to work together well</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.739" end="00:47:54.659" style="s2">we&#39;re naturally structured to work in</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.140" end="00:47:56.039" style="s2">fairly small teams and the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.659" end="00:47:58.019" style="s2">humanity has developed into something</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.039" end="00:48:00.390" style="s2">that can work and massive teams of</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.019" end="00:48:02.159" style="s2">millions through you know stuffing</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.390" end="00:48:03.839" style="s2">everybody into uniforms and then having</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.159" end="00:48:05.789" style="s2">one person bark orders at a group of</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.839" end="00:48:07.709" style="s2">people or something and zero tolerance</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.789" end="00:48:11.759" style="s2">for disobedience and things like that is</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.709" end="00:48:13.769" style="s2">it works in armies is is an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.759" end="00:48:15.299" style="s2">thing but even there if you look closely</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.769" end="00:48:17.699" style="s2">you see people working in small teams</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.299" end="00:48:19.289" style="s2">they just disaggregate what the</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.699" end="00:48:21.359" style="s2">different teams are responsible for but</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.289" end="00:48:22.769" style="s2">at the end of the day it&#39;s a small group</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.359" end="00:48:26.789" style="s2">of a handful of people that actually</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.769" end="00:48:28.589" style="s2">gets things done so ok can&#39;t we make use</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.789" end="00:48:30.239" style="s2">of that information as we&#39;re structure</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.589" end="00:48:32.309" style="s2">you know that&#39;s the idea behind the fact</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.239" end="00:48:34.499" style="s2">of the moxie idea is really you probably</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.309" end="00:48:36.539" style="s2">don&#39;t the money thinking behind it was</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.499" end="00:48:38.369" style="s2">you don&#39;t want the base group or the pod</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.539" end="00:48:40.109" style="s2">or whatever you call it to be more than</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.369" end="00:48:42.359" style="s2">seven people five might actually be</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.109" end="00:48:43.650" style="s2">better first of all an odd number of</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.359" end="00:48:44.819" style="s2">people so you can make a majority</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.650" end="00:48:46.949" style="s2">decision by vote because you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.819" end="00:48:48.209" style="s2">always gonna get consensus and secondly</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.949" end="00:48:49.739" style="s2">you don&#39;t want the group more than let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.209" end="00:48:51.599" style="s2">say seven people because you want you</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.739" end="00:48:53.759" style="s2">want everybody to be heard you want</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.599" end="00:48:55.709" style="s2">everybody you know pass the talking</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.759" end="00:48:57.719" style="s2">stick around the circle you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.709" end="00:48:59.579" style="s2">to exhaust people&#39;s patience and focus</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.719" end="00:49:01.650" style="s2">of attention and if you have more than</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.579" end="00:49:02.360" style="s2">seven people it&#39;s just too much even</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.650" end="00:49:05.360" style="s2">seven is</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.360" end="00:49:07.190" style="s2">at five is better so even the introverts</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.360" end="00:49:09.260" style="s2">even their rows to be quiet people get a</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.190" end="00:49:10.310" style="s2">chance to talk and be heard and then at</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.260" end="00:49:11.480" style="s2">the end of the day they choose a</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.310" end="00:49:13.940" style="s2">representative and send that</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.480" end="00:49:15.830" style="s2">representative up to the next level and</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.940" end="00:49:17.120" style="s2">it&#39;s the same process they&#39;re in a group</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.830" end="00:49:18.650" style="s2">of either five people or seven people</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.120" end="00:49:20.270" style="s2">depending on how big the part is that</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.650" end="00:49:23.150" style="s2">you choose the N equals five or in</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.270" end="00:49:24.560" style="s2">equals seven and then again they make</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.150" end="00:49:26.180" style="s2">sure everybody&#39;s heard they try to</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.560" end="00:49:28.310" style="s2">develop consensus if they can&#39;t they</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.180" end="00:49:29.870" style="s2">have a vote and again they choose a</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.310" end="00:49:31.400" style="s2">representative up to the next level so</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.870" end="00:49:33.890" style="s2">that you always are working within the</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.400" end="00:49:35.000" style="s2">natural unit the natural a small group</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.890" end="00:49:38.540" style="s2">unit the human beings are actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.000" end="00:49:40.580" style="s2">designed for does that make sense yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.540" end="00:49:43.250" style="s2">but until we actually would do that we</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.580" end="00:49:45.110" style="s2">don&#39;t act like we we know the Sociology</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.250" end="00:49:46.760" style="s2">we know the science but not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.110" end="00:49:48.080" style="s2">how that actually plays out in the real</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.760" end="00:49:49.730" style="s2">world right like we have this whole</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.080" end="00:49:51.470" style="s2">conversation for an hour on fractal</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.730" end="00:49:53.120" style="s2">democracy and some of the issues that</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.470" end="00:49:56.570" style="s2">could arise and yet it&#39;s not in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.120" end="00:49:59.230" style="s2">world actually playing right and so what</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.570" end="00:50:01.820" style="s2">we were playing with and I don&#39;t it was</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.230" end="00:50:03.290" style="s2">forming a board right and having it run</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.820" end="00:50:04.760" style="s2">with liquid democracies no matter how</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.290" end="00:50:07.370" style="s2">many members there are there they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.760" end="00:50:08.900" style="s2">putting their power they&#39;re choosing who</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.370" end="00:50:10.730" style="s2">on the board represents them and if the</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.900" end="00:50:11.990" style="s2">person on the board isn&#39;t doing what</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.730" end="00:50:13.670" style="s2">they want them to do you just move your</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.990" end="00:50:16.130" style="s2">vote and so people around the board</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.670" end="00:50:17.780" style="s2">table have a different power dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.130" end="00:50:20.120" style="s2">based on who gave them their vote and</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.780" end="00:50:21.890" style="s2">yet your hat you&#39;re coming to consensus</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.120" end="00:50:23.990" style="s2">decision-making with five seven nine</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.890" end="00:50:26.030" style="s2">people right who are meeting weekly and</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.990" end="00:50:27.380" style="s2">having but are paid for it so we&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.030" end="00:50:29.240" style="s2">don&#39;t I mean it&#39;s not a hobby it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.380" end="00:50:32.150" style="s2">something that needs to fit around the</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.240" end="00:50:33.710" style="s2">rest of your life um and who is how</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.150" end="00:50:35.870" style="s2">those people are decided on with</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.710" end="00:50:37.190" style="s2">democracy the top delegated people are</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.870" end="00:50:39.200" style="s2">the ones that come into play maybe</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.190" end="00:50:42.950" style="s2">something like fractal democracy or</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.200" end="00:50:44.180" style="s2">you&#39;re able to form to form groups but</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.950" end="00:50:45.800" style="s2">then there&#39;s like well maybe I want one</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.180" end="00:50:47.600" style="s2">group for my food right and one group</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.800" end="00:50:49.580" style="s2">for my clothing and and one group did or</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.600" end="00:50:51.230" style="s2">I don&#39;t care about I want to eat but</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.580" end="00:50:53.150" style="s2">it&#39;s someone else could deal with deal</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.230" end="00:50:54.830" style="s2">with clothing so a bit of like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.150" end="00:50:56.120" style="s2">dealing with the Menna the big of like</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.830" end="00:50:58.610" style="s2">how this could look if there were</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.120" end="00:50:59.810" style="s2">millions of people and also what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.610" end="00:51:02.120" style="s2">starting from the ground there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.810" end="00:51:05.570" style="s2">even a board yet right the board might</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.120" end="00:51:07.400" style="s2">naturally form with who&#39;s here first but</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.570" end="00:51:09.260" style="s2">if we&#39;re not willing just to recreate</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.400" end="00:51:10.910" style="s2">that structure once there&#39;s a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.260" end="00:51:12.910" style="s2">people who are like wait yeah we love it</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.910" end="00:51:16.190" style="s2">we don&#39;t want a board and there&#39;s a new</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.910" end="00:51:18.230" style="s2">thing that can emerge that isn&#39;t a board</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.190" end="00:51:20.869" style="s2">we&#39;re open to it and so that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.230" end="00:51:22.940" style="s2">like you&#39;re also come here to very it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.869" end="00:51:26.210" style="s2">always a bit of a chaotic time but like</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.940" end="00:51:27.920" style="s2">this thing is constantly evolving we I</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.210" end="00:51:29.539" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s good for it to be to</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.920" end="00:51:31.849" style="s2">constantly evolving or else I can never</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.539" end="00:51:33.140" style="s2">never settle into any decision pattern</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.849" end="00:51:36.289" style="s2">to move forward from am I wrong about</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.140" end="00:51:38.510" style="s2">that well the right now not wrong but</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.289" end="00:51:39.559" style="s2">right now it&#39;s because we&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.510" end="00:51:41.480" style="s2">what&#39;s working and what&#39;s not working</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.559" end="00:51:43.910" style="s2">right is this fun for Bentley and I to</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.480" end="00:51:46.220" style="s2">come to and what does it need to be so</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.910" end="00:51:49.130" style="s2">that we&#39;re moving forward towards</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.220" end="00:51:52.700" style="s2">something and it&#39;s also an enjoyable to</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.130" end="00:51:57.319" style="s2">come to and so we&#39;ve only just evolved</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.700" end="00:51:59.000" style="s2">to having the fixed the Saturday project</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.319" end="00:52:01.640" style="s2">raisins we&#39;re only on our third one</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.000" end="00:52:03.410" style="s2">tomorrow and part of that was like wait</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.640" end="00:52:05.809" style="s2">all of these people have projects and if</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.410" end="00:52:07.490" style="s2">only they could come together so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.809" end="00:52:09.230" style="s2">focus on their project let&#39;s find the</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.490" end="00:52:10.640" style="s2">common pain instead of just inventing it</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.230" end="00:52:12.950" style="s2">instead of like thinking we know what it</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.640" end="00:52:14.510" style="s2">is let&#39;s find what can help all of these</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.950" end="00:52:17.809" style="s2">projects and maybe create a platform</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.510" end="00:52:19.760" style="s2">from that may be how do we we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.809" end="00:52:21.170" style="s2">to create the communication tool but we</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.760" end="00:52:22.760" style="s2">kind of need people on board first</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.170" end="00:52:23.900" style="s2">because if we create the database what</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.760" end="00:52:27.440" style="s2">you said right which would be awesome</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.900" end="00:52:28.849" style="s2">but that&#39;s not free and so we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.440" end="00:52:30.950" style="s2">putting in that money so if we found</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.849" end="00:52:32.480" style="s2">thousands of people to be like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.950" end="00:52:33.859" style="s2">like yes we want to find our people and</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.480" end="00:52:36.200" style="s2">they put in money and that we can work</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.859" end="00:52:38.180" style="s2">through that process together using</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.200" end="00:52:41.000" style="s2">existing technology including where it</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.180" end="00:52:42.859" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work right like oh not everyone</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.000" end="00:52:44.329" style="s2">can be on video so people have to</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.859" end="00:52:46.460" style="s2">participate in the comments the comments</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.329" end="00:52:48.319" style="s2">are too chaotic it&#39;s looking for what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.460" end="00:52:51.410" style="s2">not working as we go through the process</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.319" end="00:52:53.029" style="s2">towards creating a solutions technology</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.410" end="00:52:54.380" style="s2">that&#39;s designed for anyone to bring a</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.029" end="00:52:59.569" style="s2">problem to you and find a group of</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.380" end="00:53:06.410" style="s2">people to work through it with yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.569" end="00:53:08.359" style="s2">we&#39;re not we&#39;re also learning like you</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.410" end="00:53:10.910" style="s2">said you know we know how well there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.359" end="00:53:12.770" style="s2">lot of theories on how people interact</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.910" end="00:53:14.960" style="s2">and there&#39;s a lot of tools you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.770" end="00:53:17.119" style="s2">we&#39;re finding more every day so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.960" end="00:53:18.799" style="s2">also doing you know in the process of</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.119" end="00:53:20.180" style="s2">learning what&#39;s out there learning what</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.799" end="00:53:23.059" style="s2">other people are doing make sure we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.180" end="00:53:25.220" style="s2">not duplicating that work all this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.059" end="00:53:27.559" style="s2">kind of takes time and right now we have</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.220" end="00:53:30.300" style="s2">two people so I don&#39;t even know if we</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.559" end="00:53:31.980" style="s2">need a process at this</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.300" end="00:53:34.110" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know that a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.980" end="00:53:36.300" style="s2">coming in are going to say well what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.110" end="00:53:39.150" style="s2">your decision-making process I think</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.300" end="00:53:40.590" style="s2">most people would be say oh yeah I want</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.150" end="00:53:42.480" style="s2">to kind of help the world I have a</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.590" end="00:53:45.870" style="s2">project but I want to help other people</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.480" end="00:53:48.840" style="s2">with similar projects so let&#39;s chat on</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.870" end="00:53:52.260" style="s2">video I I don&#39;t think that&#39;ll be a</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.840" end="00:53:54.870" style="s2">blocker for a lot of people it may be a</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.260" end="00:53:58.770" style="s2">blocker for you you may want there to be</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.870" end="00:54:01.110" style="s2">more structure at this point and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.770" end="00:54:02.940" style="s2">not opposed to get in there I want to be</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.110" end="00:54:04.740" style="s2">I want you to be more structure in a</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.940" end="00:54:06.900" style="s2">longer term because well it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.740" end="00:54:08.490" style="s2">perfectly nice for a small you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.900" end="00:54:10.380" style="s2">group of people have informal chats to</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.490" end="00:54:12.840" style="s2">help each other on things if you</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.380" end="00:54:14.820" style="s2">actually want to aggregate power and</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.840" end="00:54:16.380" style="s2">aggregate coordinate the activities a</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.820" end="00:54:18.210" style="s2">lot of people and aggregates the money</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.380" end="00:54:20.850" style="s2">and figure out how to spend it then you</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.210" end="00:54:24.000" style="s2">do need decision-making processes that</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.850" end="00:54:25.980" style="s2">that enable that and division of labor</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.000" end="00:54:27.240" style="s2">and so on and people you know making</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.980" end="00:54:29.700" style="s2">decisions about where they fit into the</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.240" end="00:54:33.030" style="s2">scheme of things otherwise you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.700" end="00:54:34.830" style="s2">really able to put enough order into the</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.030" end="00:54:38.630" style="s2">chaos in order to be able to move</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.830" end="00:54:40.980" style="s2">forward so you don&#39;t you know I</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.630" end="00:54:43.380" style="s2">sympathize I resonate with the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.980" end="00:54:45.480" style="s2">not wanting to impose order from above</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.380" end="00:54:48.830" style="s2">in a dictatorship right obviously that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.480" end="00:54:52.320" style="s2">why I thought of fractal democracy but</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.830" end="00:54:55.830" style="s2">same time I do want order to emerge from</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.320" end="00:54:57.840" style="s2">the chaos sufficiently to be effective</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.830" end="00:55:00.240" style="s2">because we&#39;re gonna need to for example</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.840" end="00:55:04.080" style="s2">in relation to the climate crisis we</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.240" end="00:55:07.260" style="s2">need to do some big stuff really fast</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.080" end="00:55:09.660" style="s2">and that&#39;s going to require a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.260" end="00:55:12.150" style="s2">aggregation of resources and some major</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.660" end="00:55:14.190" style="s2">decisions to do things like shut down</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.150" end="00:55:15.960" style="s2">coal-fired power plants and decide you</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.190" end="00:55:18.030" style="s2">know to build some Giga factories for</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.960" end="00:55:19.770" style="s2">solar panels and things like that pool</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.030" end="00:55:22.530" style="s2">the money to do that billions of dollars</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.770" end="00:55:24.000" style="s2">per gigafactory it&#39;s it&#39;s not it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.530" end="00:55:25.470" style="s2">non-trivial thing and just sort of get</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.000" end="00:55:28.260" style="s2">together with a few people and chatting</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.470" end="00:55:32.010" style="s2">about it the video call isn&#39;t going to</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.260" end="00:55:33.330" style="s2">be the tool that makes that happen so so</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.010" end="00:55:36.030" style="s2">yes I think that having a</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.330" end="00:55:40.080" style="s2">decision-making structure which is</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.030" end="00:55:43.380" style="s2">democratic and bottom-up but yet is</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.080" end="00:55:46.200" style="s2">effective is going to be really</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.380" end="00:55:48.119" style="s2">crucial and yeah and I think that I</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.200" end="00:55:49.380" style="s2">think that maybe Jubilee you probably</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.119" end="00:55:52.849" style="s2">agree with me which is why you thought</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.380" end="00:55:55.349" style="s2">Franco Marquez II was an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.849" end="00:55:57.269" style="s2">yeah I mean I love interesting tools I</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.349" end="00:56:01.470" style="s2">love like figuring out how things could</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.269" end="00:56:03.859" style="s2">work part of it is that what Bradley</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.470" end="00:56:06.089" style="s2">said that this isn&#39;t necessarily a</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.859" end="00:56:07.380" style="s2">sticking point for a lot of people right</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.089" end="00:56:09.269" style="s2">other people don&#39;t necessarily need us</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.380" end="00:56:12.150" style="s2">to have that&#39;s that before they they</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.269" end="00:56:13.740" style="s2">come on board you do and so if you</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.150" end="00:56:14.940" style="s2">wanted to come on board that would be</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.740" end="00:56:16.170" style="s2">part of like listen I&#39;m not on board</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.940" end="00:56:17.670" style="s2">unless we already have the structure or</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.170" end="00:56:20.279" style="s2">I&#39;m here to help make that structure</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.670" end="00:56:21.720" style="s2">right and you&#39;re here for like this week</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.279" end="00:56:23.130" style="s2">so that&#39;s not so glad necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.720" end="00:56:25.410" style="s2">something that I&#39;m not asking you to</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.130" end="00:56:26.160" style="s2">take on but the point is as people come</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.410" end="00:56:28.829" style="s2">on board</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.160" end="00:56:30.660" style="s2">that&#39;s not we both have answers to those</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.829" end="00:56:32.609" style="s2">issues is like how we create in a</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.660" end="00:56:34.140" style="s2">massive group but we are not stuck on</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.609" end="00:56:35.490" style="s2">that because we have answers in her head</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.140" end="00:56:38.220" style="s2">right so we&#39;re like we can figure this</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.490" end="00:56:40.650" style="s2">out no problem but if you like if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.220" end="00:56:42.690" style="s2">not at that point it&#39;s yours to solve</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.650" end="00:56:45.450" style="s2">right it&#39;s yours to kind of greet and be</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.690" end="00:56:46.799" style="s2">like how do we how do we get the</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.450" end="00:56:49.529" style="s2">decision-making process</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.799" end="00:56:51.089" style="s2">how do we solve problems when we have</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.529" end="00:56:52.640" style="s2">the Dunbar number like how does that</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.089" end="00:56:54.569" style="s2">actually happen how do we have</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.640" end="00:56:56.009" style="s2">conversations with four people around a</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.569" end="00:56:57.299" style="s2">table and have the best things get to</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.009" end="00:56:59.099" style="s2">the table and we&#39;re having the</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.299" end="00:57:00.750" style="s2">conversations around that that structure</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.099" end="00:57:02.190" style="s2">as opposed to just imposing one and</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.750" end="00:57:03.690" style="s2">eventually we will have to impose one</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.190" end="00:57:06.329" style="s2">because you can&#39;t have infinite choices</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.690" end="00:57:08.730" style="s2">there has to be you know three pick why</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.329" end="00:57:10.799" style="s2">do you want to play it never yes sir</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.730" end="00:57:12.809" style="s2">yeah so let me just clarify gesture</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.799" end="00:57:16.200" style="s2">we&#39;re in complete agreement with that</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.809" end="00:57:20.730" style="s2">there needs to be a process and we are</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.200" end="00:57:22.920" style="s2">working on that process so there&#39;s no I</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.730" end="00:57:25.289" style="s2">would guess that it&#39;s going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.920" end="00:57:26.940" style="s2">decision-making structure and and all</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.289" end="00:57:31.170" style="s2">structures for all kind of different</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.940" end="00:57:33.119" style="s2">things but they will come into play when</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.170" end="00:57:36.569" style="s2">it&#39;s time for them to come into play</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.119" end="00:57:40.200" style="s2">when people need them and probably that</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.569" end="00:57:43.500" style="s2">video chat here is partly exactly for</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.200" end="00:57:45.180" style="s2">that reason to discuss okay what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.500" end="00:57:49.440" style="s2">structure do we actually need what kind</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.180" end="00:57:52.019" style="s2">of next step do we need and so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.440" end="00:57:53.730" style="s2">think what they do know about so far as</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.019" end="00:57:55.380" style="s2">what structure are we gonna put in place</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.730" end="00:57:57.829" style="s2">so we&#39;re just not quite there yet but</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.380" end="00:57:59.910" style="s2">that&#39;s what we are actively</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.829" end="00:58:03.450" style="s2">okay yeah I kind of thought that that</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.910" end="00:58:07.819" style="s2">was the mission of this setters chats</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.450" end="00:58:07.819" style="s2">which which is to try to decide that</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.150" end="00:58:16.530" style="s2">that is one of the goals yeah and this</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.910" end="00:58:17.910" style="s2">is also the chicken in the egg of like</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.530" end="00:58:19.680" style="s2">the chaos it&#39;s like well we need a</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.910" end="00:58:21.869" style="s2">finance structure we need like what is</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.680" end="00:58:23.760" style="s2">the most important and we can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.869" end="00:58:25.290" style="s2">decide on any of until there&#39;s people so</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.760" end="00:58:27.150" style="s2">what we&#39;re actually focused on is how do</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.290" end="00:58:30.660" style="s2">we get people right how do we get five</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.150" end="00:58:32.010" style="s2">people and they&#39;re not going to come on</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.660" end="00:58:34.230" style="s2">board unless this is fun</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.010" end="00:58:35.970" style="s2">so what&#39;s the structure of actually fix</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.230" end="00:58:38.730" style="s2">our world Friday right like how do we</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.970" end="00:58:40.500" style="s2">make this enjoyable for like was this</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.730" end="00:58:41.849" style="s2">enjoyable for you Jonah so Jasper for</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.500" end="00:58:43.589" style="s2">you to come on board does this work for</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.849" end="00:58:46.160" style="s2">us to have people come on board right</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.589" end="00:58:49.260" style="s2">that are like here for just one week and</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.160" end="00:58:50.760" style="s2">are we actually creating solutions maybe</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.260" end="00:58:52.619" style="s2">we don&#39;t concentrate on the tech and</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.760" end="00:58:54.299" style="s2">what that process is we actually figure</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.619" end="00:58:57.420" style="s2">out a solution together to something</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.299" end="00:58:59.849" style="s2">right that is we focus on food or we</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.420" end="00:59:06.359" style="s2">focus on we&#39;re still having all of those</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.849" end="00:59:08.359" style="s2">conversations constantly okay so we</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.359" end="00:59:12.210" style="s2">could take that as the topic I mean if</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.359" end="00:59:18.420" style="s2">we could definitely in our next 30</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.210" end="00:59:19.890" style="s2">seconds but yeah I mean that&#39;s that that</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.420" end="00:59:21.930" style="s2">was actually the top that was one of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.890" end="00:59:25.079" style="s2">topics of today that we kind of talked</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.930" end="00:59:29.430" style="s2">about was you know which which of these</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.079" end="00:59:33.559" style="s2">things to use so yeah so if you want</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.430" end="00:59:37.619" style="s2">that&#39;s why again will join do it again I</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.559" end="00:59:39.900" style="s2">guess that&#39;s why we were also trying to</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.619" end="00:59:43.440" style="s2">look at this micro solidarity and the</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.900" end="00:59:45.240" style="s2">collective one thing because potentially</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.440" end="00:59:51.410" style="s2">one of those things</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.240" end="01:00:04.140" style="s2">my provides a good for going processes I</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.410" end="01:00:06.660" style="s2">assume okay I know you guys yonis and me</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.140" end="01:00:09.329" style="s2">to this particular meeting are you</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.660" end="01:00:10.650" style="s2">thinking that this the meeting that</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.329" end="01:00:13.260" style="s2">started with Jubilee and</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.650" end="01:00:15.390" style="s2">Bentley is meant to grow into a large</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.260" end="01:00:17.940" style="s2">meeting with more people until and then</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.390" end="01:00:20.100" style="s2">from there work out a decision structure</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.940" end="01:00:21.510" style="s2">and do something and then grow further</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.100" end="01:00:23.340" style="s2">in other words are you planting the seed</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.510" end="01:00:25.590" style="s2">of the entire global movement here is</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.340" end="01:00:31.560" style="s2">that your concept or are you trying to</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.590" end="01:00:33.300" style="s2">design a an abstract vehicle technology</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.560" end="01:00:35.340" style="s2">that you know some other people could</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.300" end="01:00:37.080" style="s2">become the seed group of some something</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.340" end="01:00:39.390" style="s2">you know something are you designing the</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.080" end="01:00:44.400" style="s2">technology or you try to be the seed</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.390" end="01:00:46.500" style="s2">group I think more Beasley group be the</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.400" end="01:00:49.100" style="s2">C group unless someone else is and and</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.500" end="01:00:51.600" style="s2">willing to have us join them right like</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.100" end="01:00:53.880" style="s2">other people aren&#39;t doing the work we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.600" end="01:00:55.230" style="s2">doing they&#39;re doing adjacent work and so</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.880" end="01:00:56.520" style="s2">that&#39;s partly like sometimes there are</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.230" end="01:00:58.410" style="s2">people doing the work we&#39;re doing we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.520" end="01:01:00.840" style="s2">trying to find the space of what do we</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.410" end="01:01:05.820" style="s2">have to offer that is within this realm</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.840" end="01:01:07.500" style="s2">of tech and solutions that&#39;s also not</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.820" end="01:01:13.050" style="s2">being done in this way and therefore not</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.500" end="01:01:21.900" style="s2">being done the same time I see also</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.050" end="01:01:26.730" style="s2">trying trying to create you for yourself</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.900" end="01:01:30.720" style="s2">to be the group yeah yeah yeah it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.730" end="01:01:34.710" style="s2">jasper&#39;s point the the primary goal is</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.720" end="01:01:36.810" style="s2">for that group to exist the tools are a</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.710" end="01:01:38.550" style="s2">means to get there and we&#39;ll use other</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.810" end="01:01:41.340" style="s2">tools if if they exist</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.550" end="01:01:44.100" style="s2">we&#39;re not dogmatic about creating the</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.340" end="01:01:45.360" style="s2">tools yeah I don&#39;t want to reinvent the</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.100" end="01:01:47.670" style="s2">wheel we want to use what&#39;s out there</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.360" end="01:01:48.900" style="s2">but nothing&#39;s quite the tool like we</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.670" end="01:01:50.160" style="s2">can&#39;t even find the schedule it&#39;s by the</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.900" end="01:01:52.440" style="s2">way Heather said she might be able to</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.160" end="01:01:55.110" style="s2">find she knows it exists and think she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.440" end="01:01:56.040" style="s2">used it okay I&#39;ve had an amazing</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.110" end="01:02:01.490" style="s2">conversation with her</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.040" end="01:02:06.390" style="s2">sorry Jesper interrupted on apologize I</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.490" end="01:02:10.290" style="s2">was I was under the the thing that for</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.390" end="01:02:13.530" style="s2">me is interesting is to see if I can</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.290" end="01:02:16.260" style="s2">empower lots of little groups to form by</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.530" end="01:02:19.470" style="s2">giving them a structure that they can</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.260" end="01:02:22.920" style="s2">use that works fairly smoothly and also</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.470" end="01:02:24.059" style="s2">for people to find their people which</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.920" end="01:02:25.410" style="s2">that was a</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.059" end="01:02:27.479" style="s2">phrase that you said early on in this</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.410" end="01:02:30.239" style="s2">conversation today that resonated with</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.479" end="01:02:33.269" style="s2">me Julie another thing that resonated</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.239" end="01:02:35.069" style="s2">with me as you said you know find your</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.269" end="01:02:37.049" style="s2">people even if you&#39;re autistic or</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.069" end="01:02:38.759" style="s2">something and 99 people out of a hundred</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.049" end="01:02:40.619" style="s2">are not gonna resonate with you but you</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.759" end="01:02:43.920" style="s2">want to find the one out of hundred that</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.619" end="01:02:48.449" style="s2">does okay I think that&#39;s an important</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.920" end="01:02:49.829" style="s2">criteria because because it&#39;s true you</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.449" end="01:02:51.989" style="s2">know that you one doesn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.829" end="01:02:53.939" style="s2">resonate most people don&#39;t resonate with</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.989" end="01:02:55.949" style="s2">a thousand people there is the</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.939" end="01:02:57.959" style="s2">sociologist talk about agreeableness or</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.949" end="01:03:01.699" style="s2">disagreeableness is for example is one</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.959" end="01:03:08.759" style="s2">of the key one of the five key traits</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.699" end="01:03:11.549" style="s2">and how does that work in a group like</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.759" end="01:03:14.309" style="s2">this like if it&#39;s completely based on on</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.549" end="01:03:16.619" style="s2">how likable you are and otherwise nobody</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.309" end="01:03:18.839" style="s2">wants to work with you then you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.619" end="01:03:20.880" style="s2">have the disagreeable people excluded</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.839" end="01:03:25.319" style="s2">but ironically sometimes the</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.880" end="01:03:26.939" style="s2">disagreeable people are especially clear</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.319" end="01:03:28.920" style="s2">thinkers that&#39;s what makes them seem</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.939" end="01:03:31.170" style="s2">disagreeable as they keep on coming up</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.920" end="01:03:33.150" style="s2">with objections because they people are</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.170" end="01:03:35.219" style="s2">talking the way that they fight is maybe</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.150" end="01:03:36.630" style="s2">not well grounded in logic or something</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.219" end="01:03:38.219" style="s2">like this and so they say well wait a</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.630" end="01:03:40.109" style="s2">minute you guys are full of such</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.219" end="01:03:42.749" style="s2">and such is the case and that comes</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.109" end="01:03:44.699" style="s2">across as disagreeable so entire</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.749" end="01:03:46.499" style="s2">cultures are based around you know being</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.699" end="01:03:49.109" style="s2">agreeable the Japanese culture for</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.499" end="01:03:50.939" style="s2">example the British have this</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.109" end="01:03:52.920" style="s2">interesting way of trying to be</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.939" end="01:03:54.660" style="s2">disagreeable without being too obvious</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.920" end="01:03:58.079" style="s2">about it and so on so this is actually a</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.660" end="01:04:01.739" style="s2">fairly big deal and and thinking about a</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.079" end="01:04:04.009" style="s2">structure that allows people to to be</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.739" end="01:04:06.269" style="s2">effective and to work and teams together</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.009" end="01:04:08.579" style="s2">whatever their personal characteristics</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.269" end="01:04:10.170" style="s2">in that sense of communication styles</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.579" end="01:04:12.049" style="s2">although of course you want people to</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.170" end="01:04:14.910" style="s2">improve in the communication styles</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.049" end="01:04:16.619" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a part of this as well and</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.910" end="01:04:20.609" style="s2">so I&#39;m interested in the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.619" end="01:04:22.469" style="s2">creating a vehicle in which it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.609" end="01:04:24.900" style="s2">possible for everyone to be heard</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.469" end="01:04:26.459" style="s2">remember I said earlier even the</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.900" end="01:04:27.839" style="s2">introverts making sure that everybody</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.459" end="01:04:29.489" style="s2">gets a talking stick everybody gets a</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.839" end="01:04:32.729" style="s2">chance to say something and be heard and</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.489" end="01:04:34.380" style="s2">yet be effective as a group and also be</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.729" end="01:04:36.689" style="s2">able to aggregate the work of many many</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.380" end="01:04:38.040" style="s2">people which is that&#39;s again I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.689" end="01:04:39.390" style="s2">gonna be a broken record</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.040" end="01:04:40.860" style="s2">but that&#39;s why it occurred to me that a</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.390" end="01:04:42.810" style="s2">fact of democracy approach might be</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.860" end="01:04:44.730" style="s2">useful because it kind of allows you to</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.810" end="01:04:46.740" style="s2">do that and it would tend I will admit</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.730" end="01:04:48.360" style="s2">if you have a group of let&#39;s say seven</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.740" end="01:04:49.950" style="s2">people and they choose a spokesperson</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.360" end="01:04:52.920" style="s2">and they&#39;re encouraged to choose</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.950" end="01:04:55.760" style="s2">somebody who who&#39;s particularly good at</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.920" end="01:04:59.010" style="s2">being a spokesperson who is particularly</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.760" end="01:05:00.840" style="s2">empathetic listens well takes the</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.010" end="01:05:02.820" style="s2">concerns of the group forward and so on</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.840" end="01:05:04.830" style="s2">what you&#39;re probably doing there is</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.820" end="01:05:09.320" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re creating a bias towards</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.830" end="01:05:11.610" style="s2">agreeable somewhat agreeable people but</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.320" end="01:05:13.050" style="s2">you know it&#39;s likeable enough that</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.610" end="01:05:15.570" style="s2">they&#39;ll get everybody else or majority</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.050" end="01:05:17.640" style="s2">of the votes in the group but you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.570" end="01:05:18.990" style="s2">actually go to totally agreeable people</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.640" end="01:05:21.930" style="s2">because totally agree people people</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.990" end="01:05:24.120" style="s2">maybe have a really hard time making a</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.930" end="01:05:27.600" style="s2">strong case because they don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.120" end="01:05:29.460" style="s2">upset anybody so so this is this is</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.600" end="01:05:31.650" style="s2">again why I think that at the end of the</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.460" end="01:05:33.300" style="s2">day complete consensus basis might not</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.650" end="01:05:37.580" style="s2">be feasible I think we actually need a</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.300" end="01:05:40.620" style="s2">process for coming to majority decisions</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.580" end="01:05:42.720" style="s2">but but in such a way that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.620" end="01:05:44.520" style="s2">strong accountability there&#39;s always the</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.720" end="01:05:47.010" style="s2">possibility of recalling your decision</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.520" end="01:05:51.660" style="s2">or your spokesperson and that that you</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.010" end="01:05:53.640" style="s2">can ensure that the that weapon aware no</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.660" end="01:05:55.650" style="s2">matter who you are you are always going</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.640" end="01:05:57.810" style="s2">to get a chance to speak directly to</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.650" end="01:06:00.990" style="s2">your spokesperson and make sure that</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.810" end="01:06:02.280" style="s2">they&#39;ve understood your concerns the</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.990" end="01:06:04.350" style="s2">liquid democracy thing that you said</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.280" end="01:06:05.730" style="s2">earlier is kind of sketched over very</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.350" end="01:06:07.940" style="s2">quickly I think we talked about the end</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.730" end="01:06:10.860" style="s2">of our one-on-one talk the other day</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.940" end="01:06:13.550" style="s2">Jubilee and I didn&#39;t fully understand</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.860" end="01:06:15.990" style="s2">what you had in mind for the model there</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.550" end="01:06:20.340" style="s2">but that&#39;s maybe something we should</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.990" end="01:06:23.490" style="s2">talk about again are you familiar with</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.340" end="01:06:26.160" style="s2">liquid democracy just yeah in principle</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.490" end="01:06:27.960" style="s2">but I haven&#39;t used it okay it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.160" end="01:06:29.490" style="s2">giving your vote to somebody else as</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.960" end="01:06:31.620" style="s2">long as you feel comfortable doing so</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.490" end="01:06:33.600" style="s2">you sort of say here you&#39;ve got you on</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.620" end="01:06:35.610" style="s2">this particular class of issue I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.600" end="01:06:38.970" style="s2">trust you to make decision to cast my</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.610" end="01:06:43.740" style="s2">vote yeah but you can recall it any time</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.970" end="01:06:45.360" style="s2">you want yeah basically so yes and that</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.740" end="01:06:47.610" style="s2">was why I like the concept of liquid</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.360" end="01:06:50.580" style="s2">democracy but we are past the hour so we</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.610" end="01:06:51.569" style="s2">should probably end our fix our role</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.580" end="01:06:53.459" style="s2">Friday</p>
