<p begin="00:00:11.360" end="00:00:16.640" style="s2">we sat for a moment at the emergence of</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.160" end="00:00:17.840" style="s2">systems of justification and we&#39;ve kind</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.640" end="00:00:18.800" style="s2">of got a little bit of a handle on</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.840" end="00:00:20.560" style="s2">what&#39;s up there</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.800" end="00:00:23.039" style="s2">together like now we&#39;re getting into</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.560" end="00:00:25.279" style="s2">this shared space</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.039" end="00:00:26.800" style="s2">and we can kind of fast forward so now</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.279" end="00:00:29.599" style="s2">we&#39;ve got cultural evolution</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.800" end="00:00:31.359" style="s2">you know right step one humans exit the</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.599" end="00:00:33.280" style="s2">role of apex predator and or start</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.359" end="00:00:35.120" style="s2">playing a totally different game</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.280" end="00:00:37.120" style="s2">step two they start playing that game</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.120" end="00:00:38.079" style="s2">against each other we can focus on that</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.120" end="00:00:41.360" style="s2">if we like</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.079" end="00:00:45.039" style="s2">right um and maybe game a yeah</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.360" end="00:00:47.039" style="s2">exactly game a that&#39;s right exactly</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.039" end="00:00:48.160" style="s2">um and then and then we enter into where</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.039" end="00:00:51.039" style="s2">we are now right</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.160" end="00:00:52.239" style="s2">which is we&#39;re reaching the the end of</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.039" end="00:00:54.719" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.239" end="00:00:56.160" style="s2">phase into that exact stage so okay</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.719" end="00:00:57.280" style="s2">what&#39;s so let&#39;s talk about that so you</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.160" end="00:00:58.879" style="s2">talked about the digital</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.280" end="00:01:01.120" style="s2">so let&#39;s do the same thing let&#39;s zoom</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.879" end="00:01:04.320" style="s2">into the the tail end</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.120" end="00:01:07.200" style="s2">of the culture game and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.320" end="00:01:08.240" style="s2">the emergence of the new thing exactly</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.200" end="00:01:11.360" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.240" end="00:01:13.040" style="s2">so um let&#39;s at least let&#39;s ground</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.360" end="00:01:15.280" style="s2">ourselves about where we are</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.040" end="00:01:16.799" style="s2">so we can have a nice frame for what we</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.280" end="00:01:18.799" style="s2">can be talking about what&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.799" end="00:01:22.159" style="s2">difficult to talk about given</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.799" end="00:01:24.240" style="s2">what we don&#39;t know is coming right um so</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.159" end="00:01:26.560" style="s2">so in the tree of knowledge the tree of</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.240" end="00:01:28.880" style="s2">knowledge says following matter</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.560" end="00:01:30.560" style="s2">life mind and culture are such radically</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.880" end="00:01:33.439" style="s2">different planes of existence</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.560" end="00:01:34.720" style="s2">okay because what emerges is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.439" end="00:01:36.560" style="s2">coordinating system</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.720" end="00:01:38.479" style="s2">of information processing and</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.560" end="00:01:40.240" style="s2">communication networks</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.479" end="00:01:41.680" style="s2">that coordinate the flow of energy to</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.240" end="00:01:44.799" style="s2">give rise to more and more</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.680" end="00:01:49.040" style="s2">complex structure yep okay</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.799" end="00:01:51.200" style="s2">so cells store information rna dna</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.040" end="00:01:53.119" style="s2">they they process that inside their</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.200" end="00:01:54.399" style="s2">lipid membrane and then communicate with</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.119" end="00:01:56.320" style="s2">each other okay</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.399" end="00:01:58.240" style="s2">then you jump up to animals and nervous</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.320" end="00:01:59.759" style="s2">systems yoke cells together</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.240" end="00:02:01.759" style="s2">coordinate the animal of the whole and</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.759" end="00:02:04.799" style="s2">then animals communicate to each other</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.759" end="00:02:07.840" style="s2">okay then when we started</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.799" end="00:02:09.840" style="s2">jiving in our gestural</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.840" end="00:02:11.039" style="s2">symbolic way and then linked into</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.840" end="00:02:12.800" style="s2">propositions</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.039" end="00:02:15.120" style="s2">created the inner subjective language</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.800" end="00:02:17.040" style="s2">highway that yoked our subjective minds</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.120" end="00:02:18.080" style="s2">together to create the culture person</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.040" end="00:02:22.160" style="s2">plane</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.080" end="00:02:24.640" style="s2">okay so the medium to marshall mcluhan</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.160" end="00:02:25.280" style="s2">the medium is absolutely central right</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.640" end="00:02:27.440" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.280" end="00:02:28.879" style="s2">and ever since we started writing so</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.440" end="00:02:30.879" style="s2">what we started to do with writing</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.879" end="00:02:32.720" style="s2">we started to create an externalized</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.879" end="00:02:34.640" style="s2">memory of our</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.720" end="00:02:36.400" style="s2">symbolic language okay so we</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.640" end="00:02:38.160" style="s2">externalized our memory</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.400" end="00:02:39.440" style="s2">and then we stored that and created</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.160" end="00:02:40.959" style="s2">better and better systems</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.440" end="00:02:42.959" style="s2">so that other people could then process</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.959" end="00:02:45.200" style="s2">that when they learned how to read</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.959" end="00:02:47.040" style="s2">and develop printing presses and then we</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.200" end="00:02:49.040" style="s2">developed computational systems on</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.040" end="00:02:50.640" style="s2">quantitative things like an abacus</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.040" end="00:02:52.640" style="s2">and then turn that into a babbage</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.640" end="00:02:54.080" style="s2">thinking machine right</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.640" end="00:02:55.680" style="s2">and then in the twentieth centuries</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.080" end="00:02:57.840" style="s2">developed the silicon chip</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.680" end="00:02:59.680" style="s2">we developed the internet we developed</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.840" end="00:03:00.480" style="s2">artificial intelligence and can yoke</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.680" end="00:03:02.480" style="s2">them together</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.480" end="00:03:04.319" style="s2">what does that all mean we have created</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.480" end="00:03:06.560" style="s2">a whole new information processing</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.319" end="00:03:09.519" style="s2">system in communication network</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.560" end="00:03:11.360" style="s2">okay out of material culture so we built</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.519" end="00:03:12.480" style="s2">all these material cultural things our</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.360" end="00:03:14.640" style="s2">technologies</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.480" end="00:03:16.159" style="s2">but now we&#39;ve created an independent or</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.640" end="00:03:18.720" style="s2">at least interfacing</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.159" end="00:03:19.280" style="s2">artificial intelligence network so now</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.720" end="00:03:21.120" style="s2">there is</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.280" end="00:03:22.560" style="s2">information processing communication</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.120" end="00:03:23.519" style="s2">taking place in just a radically</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.560" end="00:03:26.159" style="s2">different way</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.519" end="00:03:27.280" style="s2">that&#39;s my term you know many people use</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.159" end="00:03:30.560" style="s2">the term digital</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.280" end="00:03:32.400" style="s2">okay so the digital so now</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.560" end="00:03:33.840" style="s2">that&#39;s why the tree of knowledge says</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.400" end="00:03:34.400" style="s2">very clearly we&#39;re going to be in a flux</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.840" end="00:03:36.799" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.400" end="00:03:38.480" style="s2">okay it&#39;s like it&#39;s like we it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.799" end="00:03:41.120" style="s2">what happened when we just discovered</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.480" end="00:03:42.959" style="s2">propositions we have now just discovered</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.120" end="00:03:44.239" style="s2">digital and yoking digital and</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.959" end="00:03:46.720" style="s2">interfacing with digital</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.239" end="00:03:48.799" style="s2">and creating the whole digital</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.720" end="00:03:51.360" style="s2">interconnected internet</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.799" end="00:03:53.040" style="s2">so we&#39;re on the cusp where we were at</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.360" end="00:03:54.400" style="s2">the fourth joint point we&#39;re now on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.040" end="00:03:56.640" style="s2">cusp of the fifth</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.400" end="00:03:59.599" style="s2">and we&#39;re now just opening up like we</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.640" end="00:04:03.680" style="s2">use propositions now we&#39;re opening up</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.599" end="00:04:06.799" style="s2">digital interface spaces okay so</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.680" end="00:04:10.799" style="s2">something like we discover the</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.799" end="00:04:14.879" style="s2">interest objective space and we begin</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.799" end="00:04:17.040" style="s2">exploring how to do it good yep</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.879" end="00:04:18.639" style="s2">and we notice that there&#39;s a number of</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.040" end="00:04:21.600" style="s2">basic boundary conditions</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.639" end="00:04:23.840" style="s2">right one boundary condition is how much</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.600" end="00:04:26.639" style="s2">intersubjective space can you hold</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.840" end="00:04:28.960" style="s2">yep i&#39;m limited to the boundaries of</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.639" end="00:04:30.639" style="s2">human memory there&#39;s a certain limit</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.960" end="00:04:32.639" style="s2">to the amount of intersubjective space</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.639" end="00:04:35.360" style="s2">that can be can be generated</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.639" end="00:04:36.800" style="s2">right um therefore we begin the process</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.360" end="00:04:39.680" style="s2">of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.800" end="00:04:40.840" style="s2">cybernetically enhance memory and we</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.680" end="00:04:43.840" style="s2">discover that if we</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.840" end="00:04:47.040" style="s2">externalize memory into</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.840" end="00:04:49.280" style="s2">physical reality writing</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.040" end="00:04:51.199" style="s2">then we have expanded that capacity and</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.280" end="00:04:53.440" style="s2">therefore can build much larger</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.199" end="00:04:54.800" style="s2">inter-subjective spaces which as you say</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.440" end="00:04:56.400" style="s2">also requires the</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.800" end="00:04:58.800" style="s2">creative new particular skills and</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.400" end="00:05:01.199" style="s2">capacities like literacy</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.800" end="00:05:02.960" style="s2">and probably cognitive structures for</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.199" end="00:05:05.919" style="s2">being able to do</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.960" end="00:05:07.039" style="s2">translations between languages and being</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.919" end="00:05:09.919" style="s2">able to</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.039" end="00:05:10.320" style="s2">run higher level abstractions to verify</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.919" end="00:05:12.560" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.320" end="00:05:13.360" style="s2">epistemology has to get stronger as you</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.560" end="00:05:15.199" style="s2">start having more</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.360" end="00:05:16.560" style="s2">ambiguity built into the symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.199" end="00:05:18.960" style="s2">structure just trying to map the inner</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.560" end="00:05:21.840" style="s2">subjective space</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.960" end="00:05:23.280" style="s2">we also have notions about velocity like</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.840" end="00:05:24.479" style="s2">as you said in distance</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.280" end="00:05:26.400" style="s2">right if the only way for me to read the</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.479" end="00:05:30.000" style="s2">book is i&#39;ve got to travel to milan by</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.400" end="00:05:31.759" style="s2">wagon that&#39;s you know it&#39;s a it slows</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.000" end="00:05:33.199" style="s2">down the ability for us to share their</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.759" end="00:05:34.639" style="s2">subjective space which is basically the</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.199" end="00:05:36.639" style="s2">end of the day a bandwidth issue</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.639" end="00:05:38.479" style="s2">so if i can ramp up the bandwidth by</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.639" end="00:05:40.320" style="s2">virtue of being able to call somebody or</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.479" end="00:05:42.160" style="s2">talk with somebody or if i can just do a</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.320" end="00:05:44.320" style="s2">video call over zoom the</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.160" end="00:05:46.000" style="s2">velocity of information exchange goes</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.320" end="00:05:48.400" style="s2">way up</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.000" end="00:05:49.199" style="s2">so i can now in the in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.400" end="00:05:51.280" style="s2">digital</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.199" end="00:05:53.840" style="s2">we&#39;re reaching something along the lines</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.280" end="00:05:53.840" style="s2">of a</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.000" end="00:05:59.919" style="s2">it feels like it&#39;s it&#39;s interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.600" end="00:06:03.120" style="s2">think about the quantitative qualitative</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.919" end="00:06:06.080" style="s2">shift at the quantitative level</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.120" end="00:06:07.280" style="s2">so on this side of the transition it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.080" end="00:06:10.479" style="s2">just like</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.280" end="00:06:12.560" style="s2">moore&#39;s law like the thing we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.479" end="00:06:15.360" style="s2">doing for 70 000 years</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.560" end="00:06:16.240" style="s2">we&#39;re just doing more of it faster lots</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.360" end="00:06:17.840" style="s2">and lots and lots</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.240" end="00:06:20.160" style="s2">so memory is expanding like doubling</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.840" end="00:06:22.240" style="s2">every year remember that yep</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.160" end="00:06:23.520" style="s2">and velocity is increasing and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.240" end="00:06:25.039" style="s2">number of</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.520" end="00:06:27.120" style="s2">interactions that can happen is</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.039" end="00:06:28.240" style="s2">increasing and the reification capacity</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.120" end="00:06:30.479" style="s2">to do the</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.240" end="00:06:32.000" style="s2">checksum at the epistemological level is</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.479" end="00:06:34.080" style="s2">increasing in spite of the false</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.000" end="00:06:35.199" style="s2">news fake news problem which we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.080" end="00:06:37.440" style="s2">to probably have to get to</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.199" end="00:06:38.680" style="s2">in this conversation then you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.440" end="00:06:41.280" style="s2">this notion of a</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.680" end="00:06:42.000" style="s2">qualitative shift and that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.280" end="00:06:45.520" style="s2">things get</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.000" end="00:06:47.759" style="s2">real tricky right right that implies</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.520" end="00:06:51.440" style="s2">something which is not the same as</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.759" end="00:06:54.479" style="s2">person right and not the same as culture</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.440" end="00:06:56.479" style="s2">no all of person and all of culture live</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.479" end="00:06:57.599" style="s2">below the line so whatever we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.479" end="00:06:59.520" style="s2">about on the other side of the line</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.599" end="00:07:02.960" style="s2">ain&#39;t person and it ain&#39;t culture</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.520" end="00:07:04.720" style="s2">yep right so that and that is</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.960" end="00:07:06.720" style="s2">so you have a novel information</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.720" end="00:07:09.199" style="s2">processing system and the way a silicon</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.720" end="00:07:10.479" style="s2">chip processes information right and</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.199" end="00:07:12.720" style="s2">then we build</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.479" end="00:07:13.759" style="s2">so now our what i mean we used to have</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.720" end="00:07:16.319" style="s2">you know rocks</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.759" end="00:07:18.240" style="s2">hammers build houses but now we build</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.319" end="00:07:20.560" style="s2">things that actually process information</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.240" end="00:07:21.440" style="s2">computers on their own right and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.560" end="00:07:23.440" style="s2">they get more</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.440" end="00:07:24.960" style="s2">and more learning mechanisms and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.440" end="00:07:27.120" style="s2">they get more interface we call that</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.960" end="00:07:28.800" style="s2">artificial intelligence of course</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.120" end="00:07:30.400" style="s2">and and whether it&#39;s artificial</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.800" end="00:07:32.080" style="s2">intelligence on its own like ray</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.400" end="00:07:33.520" style="s2">kurzweil thinks</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.080" end="00:07:35.680" style="s2">or like i think which is really going to</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.520" end="00:07:37.280" style="s2">be artificial intelligence interfacing</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.680" end="00:07:39.680" style="s2">with human intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.280" end="00:07:41.520" style="s2">and as our human capacity increases and</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.680" end="00:07:44.160" style="s2">we neural link as</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.520" end="00:07:44.879" style="s2">elon musk was talking you know but we</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.160" end="00:07:46.560" style="s2">build</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.879" end="00:07:49.039" style="s2">the information processing of our</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.560" end="00:07:52.240" style="s2">capacity to plug into the internet</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.039" end="00:07:55.599" style="s2">okay um uh it just the opening</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.240" end="00:07:58.160" style="s2">of that interface is</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.599" end="00:07:58.639" style="s2">like we&#39;re like jellyfish right before</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.160" end="00:08:00.639" style="s2">they got</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.639" end="00:08:01.840" style="s2">brains you know you got a distributed</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.639" end="00:08:03.680" style="s2">neural net</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.840" end="00:08:05.199" style="s2">right and then you&#39;ve got a control</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.680" end="00:08:06.479" style="s2">center system and then boom all of a</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.199" end="00:08:06.960" style="s2">sudden you can move the whole goddamn</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.479" end="00:08:09.039" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.960" end="00:08:10.479" style="s2">so we have distributed and it&#39;s getting</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.039" end="00:08:12.319" style="s2">more and more centralized</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.479" end="00:08:14.160" style="s2">and whatever that tipping point is going</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.319" end="00:08:14.800" style="s2">to be is going to launch us into the</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.160" end="00:08:16.400" style="s2">digital</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.800" end="00:08:18.479" style="s2">and that&#39;s what we&#39;re staring at here at</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.400" end="00:08:20.879" style="s2">the 21st century this is this is why the</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.479" end="00:08:22.720" style="s2">blue church is so inadequate because</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.879" end="00:08:24.240" style="s2">it&#39;s built on radically different</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.720" end="00:08:26.240" style="s2">information processing communication</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.240" end="00:08:28.560" style="s2">sense making systems that are now</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.240" end="00:08:29.440" style="s2">inadequate to manage uh what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.560" end="00:08:31.120" style="s2">opened up</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.440" end="00:08:32.640" style="s2">right and i think we can actually begin</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.120" end="00:08:35.039" style="s2">the process of making</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.640" end="00:08:35.839" style="s2">fundamental statements of what adequate</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.039" end="00:08:37.680" style="s2">looks like</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.839" end="00:08:39.120" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s where things get interesting</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.680" end="00:08:40.000" style="s2">we can actually start defining the</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.120" end="00:08:41.200" style="s2">parameter space</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.000" end="00:08:42.320" style="s2">it&#39;s like look i don&#39;t know what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.200" end="00:08:43.599" style="s2">to be on the other side of that line but</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.320" end="00:08:45.120" style="s2">i know for sure it&#39;s going to have to</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.599" end="00:08:47.200" style="s2">have this set of parameters</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.120" end="00:08:48.640" style="s2">exactly and i&#39;m not sure oh go ahead</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.200" end="00:08:50.080" style="s2">okay i was just talking with a</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.640" end="00:08:50.640" style="s2">philosophical friend we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.080" end="00:08:52.640" style="s2">about well</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.640" end="00:08:55.360" style="s2">we can&#39;t know what it is but he used the</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.640" end="00:08:57.200" style="s2">uh analogy well we can midwife it</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.360" end="00:08:58.800" style="s2">okay that is that we can put constraints</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.200" end="00:09:00.560" style="s2">on it and then we can think about</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.800" end="00:09:02.480" style="s2">what is adequate to see coming down the</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.560" end="00:09:06.000" style="s2">pike and how to hold it in a way so that</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.480" end="00:09:08.000" style="s2">chaos and order and and framings are</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.000" end="00:09:09.360" style="s2">structured well there&#39;s a simple one</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.000" end="00:09:10.399" style="s2">right i can give you one very simple</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.360" end="00:09:14.000" style="s2">parameter</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.399" end="00:09:16.399" style="s2">if it if if it if it kills everybody</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.000" end="00:09:18.240" style="s2">then it&#39;s outside of the parameter space</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.399" end="00:09:20.560" style="s2">i think we can start there</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.240" end="00:09:22.080" style="s2">right if it results in the extinction of</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.560" end="00:09:23.600" style="s2">all life</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.080" end="00:09:25.200" style="s2">outside the parameters it&#39;s certainly</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.600" end="00:09:25.920" style="s2">our prerequisite space but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.200" end="00:09:27.279" style="s2">actually the</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.920" end="00:09:28.880" style="s2">point there is actually i think that</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.279" end="00:09:29.200" style="s2">let&#39;s drill deeper on that because i</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.880" end="00:09:31.600" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.200" end="00:09:32.560" style="s2">this uh the there&#39;s something deeper</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.600" end="00:09:35.760" style="s2">there yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.560" end="00:09:36.880" style="s2">absolutely when we were and and and</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.760" end="00:09:39.279" style="s2">exiting eden</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.880" end="00:09:40.399" style="s2">is is the hint right so there was a that</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.279" end="00:09:44.080" style="s2">we had a moment</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.399" end="00:09:44.880" style="s2">where we had this uh this thing that was</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.080" end="00:09:47.040" style="s2">coming up</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.880" end="00:09:48.720" style="s2">that had to use john&#39;s language it was</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.040" end="00:09:49.440" style="s2">at the level of participatory knowing</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.720" end="00:09:51.600" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.440" end="00:09:53.200" style="s2">relevance realization something that is</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.600" end="00:09:56.160" style="s2">grounded all the way down</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.200" end="00:09:58.800" style="s2">to 13 billion years of evolution right</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.160" end="00:10:01.839" style="s2">all the way down with continuity</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.800" end="00:10:03.040" style="s2">right no discontinuity then we have this</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.839" end="00:10:06.160" style="s2">leaving of eden which</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.040" end="00:10:06.720" style="s2">has a discontinuity and we somehow exit</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.160" end="00:10:09.120" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.720" end="00:10:10.880" style="s2">to come into propositional space which</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.120" end="00:10:13.040" style="s2">is a different kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.880" end="00:10:14.560" style="s2">right then and the two are you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.040" end="00:10:16.720" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re as you said you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.560" end="00:10:18.320" style="s2">a primate you&#39;re still a primate</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.720" end="00:10:20.399" style="s2">and you&#39;re a person right but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.320" end="00:10:22.320" style="s2">discontinued between person and primate</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.399" end="00:10:23.839" style="s2">and we try to keep them linked sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.320" end="00:10:25.279" style="s2">sometimes we don&#39;t sometimes we engage</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.839" end="00:10:26.480" style="s2">in all kinds of crazy in person</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.279" end="00:10:28.399" style="s2">space that is absolutely out of</p>

<p begin="00:10:36.480" end="00:10:38.640" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.519" end="00:10:43.360" style="s2">the proposition that</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.760" end="00:10:47.120" style="s2">that digital that total that set of</p>
