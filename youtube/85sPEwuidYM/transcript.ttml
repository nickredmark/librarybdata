<p begin="00:01:05.489" end="00:01:10.110" style="s2">appreciate the way that you&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.960" end="00:01:12.479" style="s2">kind of giving recognition to all of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.110" end="00:01:16.259" style="s2">people&#39;s work that&#39;s going into to what</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.479" end="00:01:19.259" style="s2">you&#39;re doing I think that&#39;s important do</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.259" end="00:01:22.110" style="s2">I think it&#39;s very important to do yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.259" end="00:01:24.390" style="s2">it&#39;s really there&#39;s a sense of like when</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.110" end="00:01:25.860" style="s2">John is articulating John&#39;s point you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.390" end="00:01:29.100" style="s2">actually getting like a map of the whole</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.860" end="00:01:33.210" style="s2">sort of terrain of things which has come</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.100" end="00:01:33.479" style="s2">into it yeah and thank you for saying</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.210" end="00:01:37.590" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.479" end="00:01:39.500" style="s2">and also to give to give recognition to</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.590" end="00:01:45.210" style="s2">you know the distributed cognition</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.500" end="00:01:48.509" style="s2">that&#39;s actually at work and to really</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.210" end="00:01:51.360" style="s2">I&#39;m really trying to exemplify even when</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.509" end="00:01:55.380" style="s2">I&#39;m speaking mana logically I want to</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.360" end="00:01:58.560" style="s2">try to emphasize that deep reasoned deep</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.380" end="00:02:00.630" style="s2">reflection the insight deep questioning</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.560" end="00:02:03.899" style="s2">are ultimately all biological in nature</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.630" end="00:02:08.569" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to break I&#39;m trying to on in</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.899" end="00:02:12.230" style="s2">many ways a mini manner right trying to</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.569" end="00:02:13.860" style="s2">break out of this you know this</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.230" end="00:02:18.330" style="s2">monolithic</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.860" end="00:02:20.640" style="s2">monistic mind like there we have this</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.330" end="00:02:23.010" style="s2">picture of the mind is this completely</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.640" end="00:02:25.170" style="s2">self enclosed self discourse saying</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.010" end="00:02:29.670" style="s2">subterra like all of that that that</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.170" end="00:02:33.690" style="s2">completely self-imposed understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.670" end="00:02:36.570" style="s2">who and what are our meaning making is</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.690" end="00:02:38.670" style="s2">and what the mind is and this is also</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.570" end="00:02:40.230" style="s2">like I mentioned in many places you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.670" end="00:02:42.480" style="s2">probably seen this is not much in</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.230" end="00:02:44.280" style="s2">consonance with a movement within</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.480" end="00:02:46.440" style="s2">cognitive science called for econo</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.280" end="00:02:50.070" style="s2">science which is to try not see the mind</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.440" end="00:02:52.520" style="s2">as something I possess in my head but</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.070" end="00:02:55.410" style="s2">something that I participate in between</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.520" end="00:02:59.610" style="s2">my brain and my body and my embodied</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.410" end="00:03:02.640" style="s2">brain and the world right and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.610" end="00:03:05.790" style="s2">a deep connection between that model of</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.640" end="00:03:07.200" style="s2">the mind that is emerging in carbon</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.790" end="00:03:10.740" style="s2">science which i think is fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.200" end="00:03:15.770" style="s2">on the right track and the the ancient</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.740" end="00:03:18.690" style="s2">ideas of that reason and reflection</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.770" end="00:03:22.350" style="s2">insight aspiration all these things are</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.690" end="00:03:24.420" style="s2">inherently biological in nature so not</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.350" end="00:03:26.910" style="s2">only do I feel there&#39;s a moral point</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.420" end="00:03:29.310" style="s2">which is significant and important to</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.910" end="00:03:31.470" style="s2">share in credit I want to point to</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.310" end="00:03:34.980" style="s2">distributed cognition and I want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.470" end="00:03:37.050" style="s2">point to dialogical rationality and try</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.980" end="00:03:41.310" style="s2">to exemplify them as much as possible so</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.050" end="00:03:44.340" style="s2">that people can see not just not just</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.310" end="00:03:46.620" style="s2">you know here what I&#39;m referring to but</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.340" end="00:03:48.360" style="s2">they can see it exemplify and how I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.620" end="00:03:50.700" style="s2">trying to practice it before them so</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.360" end="00:03:52.890" style="s2">it&#39;s actually very important to me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.700" end="00:03:55.110" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s like practice for me in a deep</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.890" end="00:03:57.540" style="s2">sense mmm part of much is part of like</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.110" end="00:04:00.510" style="s2">my spiritual practice to try and do that</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.540" end="00:04:04.739" style="s2">more and more and more it&#39;s it seems</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.510" end="00:04:08.190" style="s2">like it&#39;s a kind of it&#39;s like a method</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.739" end="00:04:10.830" style="s2">relationship there&#39;s being represented</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.190" end="00:04:14.340" style="s2">that kind of goes up and down all of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.830" end="00:04:16.410" style="s2">levels of the stack of being you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.340" end="00:04:19.260" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of yeah the relationship would</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.410" end="00:04:21.330" style="s2">world is dialogic and then within that</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.260" end="00:04:22.919" style="s2">you know there&#39;s the intertext reality</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.330" end="00:04:25.640" style="s2">sorry I&#39;m getting stupid email</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.919" end="00:04:25.640" style="s2">notification</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.830" end="00:04:30.729" style="s2">figure out and send this off it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.900" end="00:04:34.479" style="s2">in relationship with world and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.729" end="00:04:36.550" style="s2">within self a dialogue between all of</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.479" end="00:04:40.919" style="s2">the things that are coming from well you</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.550" end="00:04:44.590" style="s2">know mother father and philosophers and</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.919" end="00:04:48.789" style="s2">everything I think that&#39;s I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.590" end="00:04:51.310" style="s2">really important so that affords me an</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.789" end="00:04:54.909" style="s2">opportunity to balance things out a</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.310" end="00:04:58.479" style="s2">little bit because for obvious reasons</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.909" end="00:05:00.370" style="s2">I&#39;ve been emphasizing the what Chris and</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.479" end="00:05:03.270" style="s2">I mr. McMaster Pietro and I call the</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.370" end="00:05:07.090" style="s2">horizontal aspects of dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.270" end="00:05:09.370" style="s2">dialectic is the sacred technology that</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.090" end="00:05:13.449" style="s2">scaffolds you into the process of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.370" end="00:05:16.360" style="s2">logos it&#39;s like it&#39;s like they say a set</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.449" end="00:05:20.379" style="s2">of directions to direct your attention</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.360" end="00:05:22.900" style="s2">and the way you&#39;re coupling to the world</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.379" end="00:05:24.610" style="s2">so that Villalobos can be imported but</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.900" end="00:05:25.930" style="s2">one of the directions of dialectic is</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.610" end="00:05:28.469" style="s2">the horizontal it&#39;s the interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.930" end="00:05:32.050" style="s2">one and that&#39;s the one that I get to</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.469" end="00:05:37.240" style="s2">practice with guy and Jordan and Chris</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.050" end="00:05:38.919" style="s2">and Andrew Sweeney etc Jack Stein but</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.240" end="00:05:41.650" style="s2">what you just mentioned is also right</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.919" end="00:05:43.870" style="s2">and this was integral to Plato the</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.650" end="00:05:45.580" style="s2">Platonic model right there&#39;s also what</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.870" end="00:05:47.949" style="s2">you might call the vertical that intra</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.580" end="00:05:51.099" style="s2">ontological that you use you have to</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.949" end="00:05:52.779" style="s2">sort of practice individually it&#39;s seen</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.099" end="00:05:54.550" style="s2">in bachelor says we&#39;re always alone with</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.779" end="00:05:55.629" style="s2">others which i think is total of one of</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.550" end="00:05:58.389" style="s2">those books which is a great way of</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.629" end="00:06:01.330" style="s2">putting it but this this this as you</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.389" end="00:06:02.740" style="s2">said this this how you meant what Plato</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.330" end="00:06:05.289" style="s2">does and there were in the Republic</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.740" end="00:06:07.779" style="s2">where the model of the justice in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.289" end="00:06:09.460" style="s2">city is reflected in the model of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.779" end="00:06:11.560" style="s2">justice between the elements of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.460" end="00:06:13.599" style="s2">psyche and vice-versa and they merge</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.560" end="00:06:17.529" style="s2">mutually afford and conform to each</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.599" end="00:06:21.099" style="s2">other so you you it&#39;s exactly that that</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.529" end="00:06:25.029" style="s2">inner via logos and that outer D logos</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.099" end="00:06:26.740" style="s2">are actually just like like the left and</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.029" end="00:06:29.080" style="s2">right fields of vision that you see</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.740" end="00:06:30.550" style="s2">through into depth perception you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.080" end="00:06:33.610" style="s2">always you&#39;re always looking through</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.550" end="00:06:37.180" style="s2">them to what what is what grounds the</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.610" end="00:06:39.039" style="s2">two of them together and that&#39;s when</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.180" end="00:06:40.810" style="s2">when that starts to happen that&#39;s when</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.039" end="00:06:42.220" style="s2">you really get a sense feeler</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.810" end="00:06:46.900" style="s2">it&#39;s a part of what I&#39;m going to deal in</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.220" end="00:06:50.560" style="s2">the in the next series after Socrates is</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.900" end="00:06:52.240" style="s2">I&#39;m going to I mean I&#39;m going to talk a</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.560" end="00:06:53.380" style="s2">lot about the horizontal because you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.240" end="00:06:55.030" style="s2">seen a lot of the work I&#39;ve been doing</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.380" end="00:06:58.300" style="s2">with a lot of people that are I owe a</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.030" end="00:07:01.030" style="s2">lot to but I&#39;ll also be bringing out</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.300" end="00:07:02.830" style="s2">that vertical and then ensuring how</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.030" end="00:07:05.260" style="s2">they&#39;re integrated together so that I</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.830" end="00:07:08.800" style="s2">mean that that&#39;s very exciting for me</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.260" end="00:07:12.430" style="s2">because when those two resonate with</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.800" end="00:07:15.700" style="s2">each other you get you get you get to a</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.430" end="00:07:21.900" style="s2">place that is a field of grounding and</p>

<p begin="00:07:25.050" end="00:07:32.050" style="s2">lot of pathways opening up this is</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.900" end="00:07:34.210" style="s2">you&#39;re saying all of that things that</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.050" end="00:07:35.950" style="s2">I&#39;ve been kind of thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.210" end="00:07:39.210" style="s2">recently I mean first and foremost</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.950" end="00:07:44.410" style="s2">there&#39;s something about the way in which</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.210" end="00:07:47.080" style="s2">the the mystic or the or the or the</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.410" end="00:07:52.180" style="s2">wisdom teacher or the religious prophet</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.080" end="00:07:55.150" style="s2">very often is speaking in in</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.180" end="00:07:56.770" style="s2">relationship to the environment very</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.150" end="00:07:59.110" style="s2">often kind of using Matt&#39;s boards</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.770" end="00:08:01.390" style="s2">derived from nature or speaking in</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.110" end="00:08:06.370" style="s2">Powerball and I think there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.390" end="00:08:09.730" style="s2">relationship between this and the the</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.370" end="00:08:11.860" style="s2">way in which our cognition takes place</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.730" end="00:08:15.250" style="s2">outside of our bodies in relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.860" end="00:08:19.500" style="s2">the aesthetic of the environment yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.250" end="00:08:19.500" style="s2">think that&#39;s a very astute observation</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.620" end="00:08:28.330" style="s2">there is I think a deep continuity and</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.120" end="00:08:28.750" style="s2">that&#39;s a phrase that my my friend and</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.330" end="00:08:31.600" style="s2">colleague</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.750" end="00:08:33.550" style="s2">Evan Thompson has introduced into for</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.600" end="00:08:40.270" style="s2">e-card saw but I think there&#39;s a deep</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.550" end="00:08:43.840" style="s2">continuity between the ineffable and and</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.270" end="00:08:46.630" style="s2">enacted mystery of everyday cognition</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.840" end="00:08:49.330" style="s2">and the ineffable and enacted mystery of</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.630" end="00:08:52.210" style="s2">some of our most ultimate experiences</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.330" end="00:08:54.130" style="s2">and I&#39;m working on a book with anybody</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.210" end="00:08:55.600" style="s2">on that&#39;s called the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.130" end="00:08:59.560" style="s2">continuum from insight to enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.600" end="00:09:01.120" style="s2">that the machinery that you are using I</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.560" end="00:09:02.490" style="s2">was I had mentioned that I was reading</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.120" end="00:09:05.170" style="s2">I&#39;m reading this book right now by</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.490" end="00:09:07.750" style="s2">Esther like not me longing to know was</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.170" end="00:09:10.600" style="s2">recommended to me and she is actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.750" end="00:09:12.010" style="s2">making a very convergent argument it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.600" end="00:09:13.690" style="s2">convergent because both she and I are</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.010" end="00:09:14.170" style="s2">deeply influenced by the work of Michael</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.690" end="00:09:17.650" style="s2">Polanyi</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.170" end="00:09:19.240" style="s2">but there&#39;s a deep continuity I want to</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.650" end="00:09:20.470" style="s2">use her example because it&#39;s a let me</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.240" end="00:09:24.040" style="s2">just use an analogy</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.470" end="00:09:25.510" style="s2">she&#39;s not - because I if there&#39;s similar</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.040" end="00:09:27.130" style="s2">to some other ones I use but it&#39;s a new</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.510" end="00:09:29.560" style="s2">one so I don&#39;t haven&#39;t you seen that</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.130" end="00:09:32.020" style="s2">there&#39;s these called magic five pictures</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.560" end="00:09:34.330" style="s2">and there&#39;s a bunch of colored dots and</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.020" end="00:09:36.610" style="s2">you sort of move the picture you do the</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.330" end="00:09:37.690" style="s2">zoom in/out optimal gripping and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.610" end="00:09:40.480" style="s2">what will happen is it will suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.690" end="00:09:41.770" style="s2">snap you&#39;ll get this aha you&#39;ll get an</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.480" end="00:09:43.750" style="s2">insight experience and something you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.770" end="00:09:45.460" style="s2">see a three-dimensional dolphin leaping</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.750" end="00:09:47.680" style="s2">out of the water and it just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.460" end="00:09:51.640" style="s2">catches right and she talks about how</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.680" end="00:09:53.170" style="s2">like you go from looking at you you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.640" end="00:09:54.790" style="s2">recognize some of this language so</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.170" end="00:09:57.460" style="s2">looking through here you go from sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.790" end="00:09:59.500" style="s2">seeing all the dots to seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.460" end="00:10:02.440" style="s2">dolphins seeing a deeper dimension and</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.500" end="00:10:05.050" style="s2">the point is on that&#39;s just an</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.440" end="00:10:07.150" style="s2">extraordinary example of something we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.050" end="00:10:09.430" style="s2">doing moment to moment you&#39;re doing it</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.150" end="00:10:12.850" style="s2">right now you&#39;re taking all the pixels</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.430" end="00:10:15.640" style="s2">on your screen right and the complicated</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.850" end="00:10:18.280" style="s2">and subtle motions of changes and</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.640" end="00:10:20.920" style="s2">variants and color and hue of my face</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.280" end="00:10:22.990" style="s2">and you&#39;re making a face and and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.920" end="00:10:25.300" style="s2">you&#39;re looking through that face into my</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.990" end="00:10:27.490" style="s2">mind and into my thoughts and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.300" end="00:10:30.610" style="s2">doing it like that and if I asked you</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.490" end="00:10:33.910" style="s2">how do you view it how do you get that</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.610" end="00:10:36.520" style="s2">depth that ontological depth perception</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.910" end="00:10:39.340" style="s2">you very well I don&#39;t know it&#39;s and it</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.520" end="00:10:41.650" style="s2">has an aspect of insight and revelation</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.340" end="00:10:44.230" style="s2">and you have to sort of you know entrust</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.650" end="00:10:46.120" style="s2">yourself to an embodied process and a</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.230" end="00:10:48.310" style="s2">skillful way of coupling to the world</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.120" end="00:10:50.380" style="s2">and then she&#39;s making the argument and</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.310" end="00:10:52.150" style="s2">she&#39;s at the s2 that&#39;s where I differ</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.380" end="00:10:56.470" style="s2">from her but she says that&#39;s similar to</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.150" end="00:10:59.350" style="s2">how we how we see God right and and and</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.470" end="00:11:02.770" style="s2">what I think she meaning is that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.350" end="00:11:05.080" style="s2">a continuity between our most mystical</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.770" end="00:11:06.910" style="s2">experiences and our most everyday</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.080" end="00:11:08.080" style="s2">experience because our everyday</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.910" end="00:11:12.190" style="s2">experience contained</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.080" end="00:11:15.280" style="s2">some of that mystery that become more</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.190" end="00:11:19.570" style="s2">aware of when when it is mystery that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.280" end="00:11:23.050" style="s2">embedded within an AW experience so I</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.570" end="00:11:24.670" style="s2">think there is in fact I think what</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.050" end="00:11:28.110" style="s2">you&#39;re saying there is exactly right I</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.670" end="00:11:31.840" style="s2">think there it&#39;s not just that the</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.110" end="00:11:35.850" style="s2">wisdom teachers are mystics are you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.840" end="00:11:38.890" style="s2">using metaphor I think they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.850" end="00:11:42.160" style="s2">affording a realization of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.890" end="00:11:45.640" style="s2">continuity between your everyday</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.160" end="00:11:47.470" style="s2">experience and your ultimate experiences</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.640" end="00:11:51.010" style="s2">I mean this is captured in Zen right</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.470" end="00:11:53.440" style="s2">that very the famous is in parable you</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.010" end="00:11:54.970" style="s2">know before I did before I did Zen</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.440" end="00:11:57.670" style="s2">mountains were mountains and rivers were</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.970" end="00:11:59.740" style="s2">rivers while I was doing Zen mountains</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.670" end="00:12:01.930" style="s2">are work mountains and rivers or rivers</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.740" end="00:12:04.960" style="s2">and then I was when I was done doing Zen</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.930" end="00:12:06.400" style="s2">mountains were mountains and rivers or</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.960" end="00:12:07.740" style="s2">rivers notice how I have to use my</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.400" end="00:12:13.440" style="s2">intonation you can make the difference</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.740" end="00:12:15.640" style="s2">right and and so it&#39;s very important and</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.440" end="00:12:18.610" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;m talking or a while but</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.640" end="00:12:21.160" style="s2">this is an accrual point this there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.610" end="00:12:24.700" style="s2">the sense of deep continuity is an</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.160" end="00:12:27.700" style="s2">alternative way of relating the</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.700" end="00:12:30.040" style="s2">transcendent to the imminent that breaks</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.700" end="00:12:33.000" style="s2">away from sort of the two worlds</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.040" end="00:12:36.960" style="s2">mythology that has tended to build an</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.000" end="00:12:41.170" style="s2">inaccessible Fortress of mystique around</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.960" end="00:12:43.900" style="s2">the transcendent and and and and and</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.170" end="00:12:47.080" style="s2">then make it very easily translatable</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.900" end="00:12:47.950" style="s2">into the absurd impossible that can just</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.080" end="00:12:50.920" style="s2">be ignored</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.950" end="00:12:53.710" style="s2">right but if I make you realize that</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.920" end="00:12:56.380" style="s2">that Ultimo and it is that ultimate is</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.710" end="00:12:58.540" style="s2">awe-inspiring and it is do of reverence</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.380" end="00:13:01.120" style="s2">I&#39;m not denying that but if I make you</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.540" end="00:13:04.360" style="s2">realize that that is has a deep</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.120" end="00:13:08.140" style="s2">continuity with how you&#39;re seeing my</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.360" end="00:13:10.900" style="s2">face then you can&#39;t dismiss it or ignore</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.140" end="00:13:13.600" style="s2">it as an input as an absurdity</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.900" end="00:13:16.270" style="s2">possibility and so I want to try and</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.600" end="00:13:19.560" style="s2">break out of the two worlds mythology</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.270" end="00:13:21.459" style="s2">and the one that builds the spiritual as</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.560" end="00:13:22.839" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.459" end="00:13:26.769" style="s2">you know it&#39;s this thing that is</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.839" end="00:13:29.679" style="s2">fortified by supernatural istic mystique</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.769" end="00:13:31.600" style="s2">and so that&#39;s why I got very excited by</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.679" end="00:13:34.839" style="s2">what you said because it&#39;s an insight</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.600" end="00:13:37.439" style="s2">right that points to an alternative way</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.839" end="00:13:40.689" style="s2">an alternative grammar of thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.439" end="00:13:44.110" style="s2">what these teachers have said to us that</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.689" end="00:13:46.209" style="s2">can perhaps we&#39;ll move it from a two</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.110" end="00:13:51.209" style="s2">worlds mythology in which it has been</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.209" end="00:13:52.509" style="s2">entrusted what were you saying John</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.209" end="00:13:57.490" style="s2">thank you</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.509" end="00:13:59.470" style="s2">thank you that&#39;s really nice I love just</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.490" end="00:14:01.149" style="s2">like throwing the piece out and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.470" end="00:14:04.600" style="s2">watching you do a little transformation</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.149" end="00:14:07.869" style="s2">on it and then it&#39;s kind of more exalted</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.600" end="00:14:10.899" style="s2">it&#39;s so I&#39;ve been I&#39;m in Athens right</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.869" end="00:14:12.490" style="s2">now and I have been for the last three</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.899" end="00:14:17.829" style="s2">months so staying with my parents Oh</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.490" end="00:14:23.519" style="s2">Warren teen you&#39;re in Athens Greece yes</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.829" end="00:14:26.170" style="s2">Wow that&#39;s a nice place yeah it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.519" end="00:14:27.999" style="s2">probably more positive than a few</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.170" end="00:14:31.509" style="s2">people&#39;s quarantine difficult at times</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.999" end="00:14:32.920" style="s2">of course but one of the things I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.509" end="00:14:36.189" style="s2">been doing is spending a lot of time in</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.920" end="00:14:40.269" style="s2">Greek Orthodox churches just so the</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.189" end="00:14:42.420" style="s2">church from a different you know yep my</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.269" end="00:14:44.920" style="s2">I grew up with the Anglican Church but</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.420" end="00:14:46.959" style="s2">one of the things you know and Anna is</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.920" end="00:14:51.519" style="s2">you know I&#39;m kind of sitting in presence</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.959" end="00:14:53.679" style="s2">and observing observing the space and</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.519" end="00:14:55.299" style="s2">observing the icons and so forth the</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.679" end="00:14:57.040" style="s2">first thing is you see the difference</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.299" end="00:14:59.589" style="s2">with the way that the people the Greek</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.040" end="00:15:03.249" style="s2">cultural relationship with it they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.589" end="00:15:04.779" style="s2">really look around and look up in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.249" end="00:15:07.329" style="s2">way that I&#39;m doing they kind of just</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.779" end="00:15:10.029" style="s2">shuffle in go straight to the icon at</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.329" end="00:15:14.980" style="s2">the front and kiss the icon and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.029" end="00:15:17.619" style="s2">kind of a very private slightly viewed</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.980" end="00:15:23.170" style="s2">with shamed kind of a feeling thing</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.619" end="00:15:25.019" style="s2">going on and the the aesthetic of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.170" end="00:15:27.959" style="s2">churches and I&#39;m definitely a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.019" end="00:15:32.529" style="s2">believer in the need to build</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.959" end="00:15:35.170" style="s2">transcendence environment but it always</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.529" end="00:15:37.240" style="s2">has this feeling of like just being</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.170" end="00:15:39.579" style="s2">on the cusp of something but you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.240" end="00:15:43.720" style="s2">get quite get it yeah you know it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.579" end="00:15:45.820" style="s2">beautiful and golden and the eye of</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.720" end="00:15:49.240" style="s2">horus is up there somewhere looking out</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.820" end="00:15:51.190" style="s2">at you but it&#39;s a doorway and a little</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.240" end="00:15:53.370" style="s2">railing and then behind that maybe a cat</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.190" end="00:15:56.440" style="s2">and then behind that something else and</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.370" end="00:15:58.680" style="s2">then you got in the street and then you</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.440" end="00:16:02.829" style="s2">can actually find the real deal</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.680" end="00:16:07.300" style="s2">hopefully and I think when you get</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.829" end="00:16:09.730" style="s2">closer to the real deal you almost have</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.300" end="00:16:12.760" style="s2">to afford space for the real deal to</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.730" end="00:16:15.339" style="s2">reveal itself I&#39;ve been having you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.760" end="00:16:18.970" style="s2">a lot of my inquiry has really just been</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.339" end="00:16:24.959" style="s2">paying very close attention to phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.970" end="00:16:27.880" style="s2">as arising and so I&#39;ll kind of see like</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.959" end="00:16:29.889" style="s2">I&#39;ve started noticing very briefly those</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.880" end="00:16:32.440" style="s2">moments in which something appears in my</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.889" end="00:16:34.990" style="s2">field which I later realized as a</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.440" end="00:16:37.690" style="s2">cyclist but for a moment my brain hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.990" end="00:16:42.550" style="s2">quite figured out yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.690" end="00:16:46.750" style="s2">first liminal yeah thing and the curious</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.550" end="00:16:48.490" style="s2">part about that is the quality of what</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.750" end="00:16:54.519" style="s2">you experience when it&#39;s in the liminal</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.490" end="00:16:56.740" style="s2">not form space is very Saturn setting</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.519" end="00:16:59.640" style="s2">really it&#39;s kind of what you are</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.740" end="00:17:03.360" style="s2">bringing to it as much as anything I</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.640" end="00:17:07.059" style="s2">want to build out one more sort of piece</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.360" end="00:17:10.419" style="s2">for you I was watching your dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.059" end="00:17:13.449" style="s2">with Jordan Peterson from years ago yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.419" end="00:17:16.169" style="s2">five years but by the way have another I</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.449" end="00:17:19.510" style="s2">wish we could have another well I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.169" end="00:17:22.390" style="s2">what was really shining out for me was</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.510" end="00:17:24.699" style="s2">the partly this kind of journey from</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.390" end="00:17:26.530" style="s2">like the IDW to what you&#39;re doing and</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.699" end="00:17:29.820" style="s2">how what you&#39;re doing is so much more</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.530" end="00:17:34.630" style="s2">bringing out that like collaborative</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.820" end="00:17:36.640" style="s2">dialogic and you know like figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.630" end="00:17:38.530" style="s2">how to really like achieve intimacy and</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.640" end="00:17:44.230" style="s2">you know the basic interpersonal stuff</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.530" end="00:17:46.419" style="s2">is actually happening but with Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.230" end="00:17:49.799" style="s2">one of the things that you agreed on was</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.419" end="00:17:51.850" style="s2">that the meaning cry</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.799" end="00:17:54.730" style="s2">which can be above you know the</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.850" end="00:17:57.789" style="s2">perennial continual crisis of being that</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.730" end="00:17:59.620" style="s2">the very specific historical trajectory</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.789" end="00:18:03.539" style="s2">of meaning crisis has different</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.620" end="00:18:05.980" style="s2">inflection points and you can go back to</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.539" end="00:18:08.309" style="s2">World War two you can go back to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.980" end="00:18:11.250" style="s2">time of of Nietzsche you can go back to</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.309" end="00:18:14.850" style="s2">Descartes you can go back to man&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.250" end="00:18:19.210" style="s2">breakage with the natural world</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.850" end="00:18:20.889" style="s2">yeah and so what I&#39;d like to do now is</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.210" end="00:18:23.169" style="s2">present a piece which is kind of just</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.889" end="00:18:29.010" style="s2">been in my head and esoteric and see if</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.169" end="00:18:31.570" style="s2">we can bring it in and it&#39;s notion of</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.010" end="00:18:36.549" style="s2">I&#39;ve called it like the landscape of</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.570" end="00:18:40.750" style="s2">trauma and what it is is an inquiry into</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.549" end="00:18:43.029" style="s2">the nature of trauma which is revealing</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.750" end="00:18:47.590" style="s2">of a lot of these kind of elements of</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.029" end="00:18:52.200" style="s2">reality that you speak to the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.590" end="00:18:56.409" style="s2">inexplicable &#39;ti of people with past</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.200" end="00:18:57.909" style="s2">traumas finding themselves finding other</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.409" end="00:19:02.500" style="s2">people in the world and coming into</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.909" end="00:19:04.360" style="s2">relationship with them neither of em</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.500" end="00:19:07.769" style="s2">being conscious of it and this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.360" end="00:19:14.460" style="s2">being invisible but meaningful like</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.769" end="00:19:14.460" style="s2">attractor and force and the way in which</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.580" end="00:19:22.059" style="s2">trauma is stored in the body as a as a</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.860" end="00:19:23.980" style="s2">really embodied property of being as a</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.059" end="00:19:28.149" style="s2">kind of disconnection from aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.980" end="00:19:31.029" style="s2">self it seems to me super tied up with</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.149" end="00:19:33.070" style="s2">embodied cognition and meters Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.029" end="00:19:35.130" style="s2">kept on talking about like you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.070" end="00:19:39.120" style="s2">bringing order as like a way of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.130" end="00:19:45.250" style="s2">narrowing in the balance of chaos and</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.120" end="00:19:47.440" style="s2">for me like it&#39;s I can see a way in</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.250" end="00:19:51.519" style="s2">which the there&#39;s a landscape of trauma</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.440" end="00:19:55.330" style="s2">which we are the embodied inheritors of</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.519" end="00:20:00.630" style="s2">and are coming back into relationship</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.330" end="00:20:00.630" style="s2">with spirituality in nature is really</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.170" end="00:20:09.730" style="s2">like a going down and into and releasing</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.420" end="00:20:11.670" style="s2">all of those like you know traumas</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.730" end="00:20:15.550" style="s2">traumas of the 20th century alone</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.670" end="00:20:16.930" style="s2">anomalous you know I was my grandfather</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.550" end="00:20:19.020" style="s2">was in the Second World War</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.930" end="00:20:22.600" style="s2">his father was in the First World War</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.020" end="00:20:26.800" style="s2">before that they lived in under awful</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.600" end="00:20:28.570" style="s2">Victorian English culture and you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.800" end="00:20:31.150" style="s2">and then we can go all the way back to</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.570" end="00:20:34.510" style="s2">how is it that they became so alienated</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.150" end="00:20:37.720" style="s2">from nature in the first place so yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.510" end="00:20:40.810" style="s2">wanted to kind of to hear how you might</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.720" end="00:20:43.960" style="s2">play with play with that notion well you</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.810" end="00:20:45.100" style="s2">throw three things that and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.960" end="00:20:47.710" style="s2">think they&#39;re happenstance and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.100" end="00:20:50.260" style="s2">interesting how there&#39;s often a</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.710" end="00:20:51.940" style="s2">gathering of things together beyond sort</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.260" end="00:20:54.730" style="s2">of our egocentric awareness or father</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.940" end="00:20:57.790" style="s2">gathered together so you you well you</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.730" end="00:21:01.390" style="s2">you you&#39;ve brought up Eastern Orthodox</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.790" end="00:21:06.790" style="s2">Christianity and then you talked about</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.390" end="00:21:09.910" style="s2">sort of the the liminal place where you</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.790" end="00:21:12.460" style="s2">can wear since making is you can get a</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.910" end="00:21:16.200" style="s2">more direct phenomenological awareness</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.460" end="00:21:19.990" style="s2">of it and how set and setting mattered</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.200" end="00:21:22.150" style="s2">and then and then you moved into the</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.990" end="00:21:23.740" style="s2">fact that responding to the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.150" end="00:21:25.240" style="s2">crisis and this is something I need to</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.740" end="00:21:27.970" style="s2">talk more about I&#39;m going to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.240" end="00:21:30.820" style="s2">though and this is you know the work of</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.970" end="00:21:33.700" style="s2">Levine and others about dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.820" end="00:21:35.980" style="s2">trauma and both collective and</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.700" end="00:21:39.580" style="s2">individual trauma and the way in which</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.980" end="00:21:41.380" style="s2">trauma gets embodied in individuals and</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.580" end="00:21:45.850" style="s2">the way it gets embedded into social</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.380" end="00:21:48.880" style="s2">systems and so why do I think all of</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.850" end="00:21:52.150" style="s2">those relate to each other well first of</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.880" end="00:21:55.390" style="s2">all it&#39;s interesting that neoplatonism</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.150" end="00:21:57.280" style="s2">actually well sorry Eastern Orthodox</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.390" end="00:21:59.230" style="s2">Christianity I should put it and the</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.280" end="00:22:02.680" style="s2">person to talk to you about this before</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.230" end="00:22:03.850" style="s2">Jonathan cause Oh Jonathan&#39;s a colleague</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.680" end="00:22:06.670" style="s2">of mine and we have a very good</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.850" end="00:22:09.160" style="s2">relationship I&#39;ve got to meet him once</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.670" end="00:22:11.170" style="s2">in person and I really really respect</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.160" end="00:22:14.230" style="s2">what he has to but he has a saying he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.170" end="00:22:14.630" style="s2">a he he&#39;s very much a proponent of</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.230" end="00:22:18.049" style="s2">Eastern</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.630" end="00:22:19.760" style="s2">Orthodox Christianity but one of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.049" end="00:22:22.100" style="s2">things that&#39;s clear in Eastern Orthodox</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.760" end="00:22:23.900" style="s2">Christianity is the way it brings the</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.100" end="00:22:25.250" style="s2">Neoplatonic project that we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.900" end="00:22:28.450" style="s2">about earlier the vertical and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.250" end="00:22:32.480" style="s2">horizontal of trying to refine and</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.450" end="00:22:36.309" style="s2">clarify intelligibility so as to enhance</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.480" end="00:22:39.830" style="s2">ontological depth perception and to know</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.309" end="00:22:43.610" style="s2">do the an agog a do the ascent right but</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.830" end="00:22:44.179" style="s2">that Neoplatonic element which is very</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.610" end="00:22:46.669" style="s2">present</p>

<p begin="00:25:22.190" end="00:25:27.950" style="s2">is bound up inseparably with dealing in</p>

<p begin="00:27:31.010" end="00:27:39.919" style="s2">that&#39;s a way to put it but I was telling</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.240" end="00:27:42.260" style="s2">you a little bit before that my you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.919" end="00:27:45.470" style="s2">might big inquiry the piece that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.260" end="00:27:47.630" style="s2">sort of most bringing to this discourse</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.470" end="00:27:50.470" style="s2">is from an understanding of Islam and</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.630" end="00:27:53.120" style="s2">Islam is relationship to the West but</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.470" end="00:27:54.710" style="s2">now I find myself almost kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.120" end="00:28:00.200" style="s2">stepping back a little bit from that</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.710" end="00:28:07.130" style="s2">inquiry and I&#39;m trying to to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.200" end="00:28:10.880" style="s2">the Jesus piece which is you know its</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.130" end="00:28:14.539" style="s2">salient incredibly to to what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.880" end="00:28:20.840" style="s2">saying because I grew up in a Christian</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.539" end="00:28:24.740" style="s2">context imbued with real real faith you</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.840" end="00:28:29.330" style="s2">know the the use of the of the name of</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.740" end="00:28:33.529" style="s2">Jesus was sort of just all over my early</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.330" end="00:28:38.360" style="s2">childhood and was in a community</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.529" end="00:28:40.970" style="s2">contacts until the age of 10 or 11 so</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.360" end="00:28:45.620" style="s2">for me a big pot of passing it all out</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.970" end="00:28:48.140" style="s2">has been sort of I think for most people</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.620" end="00:28:52.010" style="s2">the worst thing about Christianity or</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.140" end="00:28:55.620" style="s2">the Christ lineage is Christians and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.010" end="00:28:57.780" style="s2">church my father was a</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.620" end="00:28:59.520" style="s2">and a religious man has been a long time</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.780" end="00:29:04.410" style="s2">banging his head against the walls of</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.520" end="00:29:11.580" style="s2">the the culture and institutions of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.410" end="00:29:13.920" style="s2">church so I guess what I&#39;m what what it</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.580" end="00:29:18.390" style="s2">feels to me is that so much of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.920" end="00:29:22.110" style="s2">Christianity that I came from was there</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.390" end="00:29:25.470" style="s2">was a celebration of arrival it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.110" end="00:29:29.010" style="s2">we we are broken and we have arrived but</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.470" end="00:29:31.470" style="s2">have we yet done the requisite work and</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.010" end="00:29:33.300" style="s2">drawn upon the vast array of resources</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.470" end="00:29:36.480" style="s2">available to us in order to enable that</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.300" end="00:29:38.370" style="s2">know what would actually what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.480" end="00:29:40.800" style="s2">doing is is really constraining</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.370" end="00:29:43.140" style="s2">ourselves in very limited bands of</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.800" end="00:29:46.380" style="s2">thinking and I&#39;ve been sort of</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.140" end="00:29:47.970" style="s2">dialoguing a little bit with some people</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.380" end="00:29:49.410" style="s2">on various journeys like some are still</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.970" end="00:29:52.320" style="s2">Christians and we&#39;re kind of moving out</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.410" end="00:29:54.150" style="s2">of it into something else and this</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.320" end="00:29:56.970" style="s2">feeling of like the way that that like</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.150" end="00:29:59.580" style="s2">cognitive grammar is constrained by</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.970" end="00:30:03.990" style="s2">reference to things that they already</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.580" end="00:30:08.760" style="s2">know in the presupposition that that the</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.990" end="00:30:11.160" style="s2">answers are already there and for me so</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.760" end="00:30:14.309" style="s2">much of this has been like I took the I</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.160" end="00:30:15.900" style="s2">mean it&#39;s super resonant with with your</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.309" end="00:30:19.320" style="s2">path from what I know in the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.900" end="00:30:22.440" style="s2">I kind of went atheist went agnostic and</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.320" end="00:30:26.809" style="s2">then went by a completely different</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.440" end="00:30:26.809" style="s2">route to arrive at some sense of</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.500" end="00:30:34.260" style="s2">spirituality and relationship to mystery</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.480" end="00:30:36.780" style="s2">and contemplative practices and all of</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.260" end="00:30:39.990" style="s2">this stuff like all of that has occurred</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.780" end="00:30:44.070" style="s2">for me up until this point without any</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.990" end="00:30:46.370" style="s2">reference to to Christianity really or</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.070" end="00:30:48.990" style="s2">even the Bible or the figure of Christ</p>

<p begin="00:33:13.030" end="00:33:18.880" style="s2">very important I think what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.580" end="00:33:22.630" style="s2">interesting is if we could put the two</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.880" end="00:33:23.110" style="s2">of these together oh sorry I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.630" end="00:33:27.130" style="s2">pour</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.110" end="00:33:30.250" style="s2">this because what what was happening</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.130" end="00:33:31.929" style="s2">between us a few minutes ago was I see</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.250" end="00:33:35.769" style="s2">that is very much the heritage from</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.929" end="00:33:38.549" style="s2">Socrates that idea of discourse as a way</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.769" end="00:33:42.130" style="s2">of reducing drawing out of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.549" end="00:33:44.049" style="s2">like like the magic I see through and</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.130" end="00:33:45.490" style="s2">try to realize the logos that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.049" end="00:33:47.890" style="s2">occurring between us and what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.490" end="00:33:49.929" style="s2">saying and possibly in what I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.890" end="00:33:56.289" style="s2">but I direct more attention to what</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.929" end="00:34:01.179" style="s2">you&#39;re saying and how that could perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.289" end="00:34:05.559" style="s2">be reintegrated with the attempt to come</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.179" end="00:34:09.070" style="s2">into right relationship with Jesus as a</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.559" end="00:34:11.349" style="s2">sage and Christianity as a cultural</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.070" end="00:34:13.060" style="s2">historical phenomena because I think</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.349" end="00:34:17.369" style="s2">we&#39;re facing the same thing we have to</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.060" end="00:34:21.460" style="s2">try and draw out as much that&#39;s how I</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.369" end="00:34:23.530" style="s2">used to use the word Salvage but I&#39;m now</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.460" end="00:34:25.859" style="s2">moving more towards this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.530" end="00:34:29.619" style="s2">adducing trying to draw out from</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.859" end="00:34:35.220" style="s2">Christianity in a Socratic fashion what</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.619" end="00:34:38.950" style="s2">can be drawn out in a way that is</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.220" end="00:34:41.310" style="s2">integrated with trying to deal with both</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.950" end="00:34:46.480" style="s2">the personal and the collective trauma</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.310" end="00:34:53.200" style="s2">and the legacies of trauma and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.480" end="00:34:55.300" style="s2">very very tricky thing to do because and</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.200" end="00:34:58.619" style="s2">we can see secular versions of this</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.300" end="00:35:02.619" style="s2">throughout the culture Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.619" end="00:35:05.380" style="s2">valorizes the traumatized individual at</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.619" end="00:35:09.220" style="s2">the center of Christianity is the cross</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.380" end="00:35:10.450" style="s2">which is deep it which is a deep trauma</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.220" end="00:35:13.599" style="s2">induction device</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.450" end="00:35:17.050" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s designed to terror and they</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.599" end="00:35:18.550" style="s2">humiliate a person is it&#39;s designed you</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.050" end="00:35:21.210" style="s2">don&#39;t just kill the person on the cross</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.550" end="00:35:26.470" style="s2">you traumatize them to death</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.210" end="00:35:32.859" style="s2">and so Christianity can too can too</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.470" end="00:35:35.970" style="s2">readily valorize the trauma as opposed</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.859" end="00:35:39.119" style="s2">to responding to the trauma and we</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.970" end="00:35:43.230" style="s2">we can we can get into worshipping the</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.119" end="00:35:46.349" style="s2">victim rather than dealing with trauma</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.230" end="00:35:49.050" style="s2">and those are not the same thing those</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.349" end="00:35:50.700" style="s2">are not the same thing and so trying to</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.050" end="00:35:52.950" style="s2">do this Socratic deduction of</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.700" end="00:35:55.230" style="s2">Christianity and break free from the two</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.950" end="00:35:59.369" style="s2">worlds mythology is also bound up with</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.230" end="00:36:02.609" style="s2">but really wrestling with the the</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.369" end="00:36:06.320" style="s2">difficult relationship that Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.609" end="00:36:09.300" style="s2">has to follow precisely because it it</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.320" end="00:36:12.420" style="s2">valorizes and worships the traumatized</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.300" end="00:36:16.260" style="s2">individual of the victim it can most</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.420" end="00:36:24.390" style="s2">effectively mask and blind us to</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.260" end="00:36:28.200" style="s2">actually dealing with trauma because it</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.390" end="00:36:30.480" style="s2">has a look so deeply added it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.200" end="00:36:31.830" style="s2">it&#39;s like the magic eye picture all we</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.480" end="00:36:33.810" style="s2">can see is the little picture</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.830" end="00:36:36.180" style="s2">we&#39;re fascinating and we don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.810" end="00:36:40.710" style="s2">get how we&#39;re supposed to see through it</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.180" end="00:36:43.460" style="s2">and deal with it and so the thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.710" end="00:36:47.130" style="s2">so close to you that you can&#39;t see it</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.460" end="00:36:49.740" style="s2">yes yes it&#39;s like me cheese idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.130" end="00:36:51.480" style="s2">shadow that you can&#39;t jump over or or</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.740" end="00:36:54.780" style="s2">what Nietzsche in fact said of Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.480" end="00:36:57.869" style="s2">he said I hate Socrates he&#39;s so close to</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.780" end="00:36:59.670" style="s2">me I&#39;m always fighting him and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.869" end="00:37:02.490" style="s2">that&#39;s a sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.670" end="00:37:05.070" style="s2">I don&#39;t hate Christianity but</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.490" end="00:37:07.740" style="s2">Christianity is so close to me I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.070" end="00:37:10.920" style="s2">always fighting it in that in that</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.740" end="00:37:14.339" style="s2">hopefully respectful and joyful way</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.920" end="00:37:16.770" style="s2">precisely because and this is something</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.339" end="00:37:17.910" style="s2">that&#39;s I mean Thank You Jacob you really</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.770" end="00:37:19.380" style="s2">taking me to the sort of the cutting</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.910" end="00:37:21.330" style="s2">edge of my own reflection right now so I</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.380" end="00:37:24.480" style="s2">appreciate that I want to I want to</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.330" end="00:37:25.859" style="s2">genuinely thank you for that but this is</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.480" end="00:37:29.190" style="s2">where I&#39;m at right now but really trying</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.859" end="00:37:31.920" style="s2">to understand right exactly what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.190" end="00:37:35.550" style="s2">saying that you know the the the</p>

<p begin="00:37:35.550" end="00:37:38.940" style="s2">like that what you did the up and down</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.050" end="00:37:41.369" style="s2">and then to dealing with trauma they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.940" end="00:37:44.820" style="s2">inseparable abound together and there</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.369" end="00:37:46.770" style="s2">and we have a traumatized relationship</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.820" end="00:37:48.530" style="s2">with Christianity but it&#39;s made</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.770" end="00:37:49.800" style="s2">especially problematic because of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.530" end="00:37:51.510" style="s2">the way</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.800" end="00:37:54.870" style="s2">trauma is actually valorized in</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.510" end="00:37:56.550" style="s2">Christianity in a symbolic way I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.870" end="00:37:58.230" style="s2">saying that&#39;s Christianity is</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.550" end="00:38:00.600" style="s2">masochistic or sadistic I&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.230" end="00:38:01.470" style="s2">that I&#39;m saying there was I think Gerard</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.600" end="00:38:05.340" style="s2">is right there&#39;s a profound</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.470" end="00:38:08.010" style="s2">understanding there of a tendencies to</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.340" end="00:38:10.770" style="s2">scapegoat and project our trauma and all</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.010" end="00:38:13.100" style="s2">that but it can be so lost because</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.770" end="00:38:16.170" style="s2">Christianity has made this though</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.100" end="00:38:19.380" style="s2">familiar and I think it&#39;s an odd thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.170" end="00:38:22.470" style="s2">that people wear crosses around their</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.380" end="00:38:24.330" style="s2">necks and they&#39;ve lost how odd this is</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.470" end="00:38:27.720" style="s2">imagine if someone carried around a</p>

<p begin="00:38:31.770" end="00:38:35.160" style="s2">and then then say well that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.510" end="00:38:36.780" style="s2">relationship of what I hold mode that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.160" end="00:38:37.110" style="s2">a symbol of what I hold most sacred we</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.780" end="00:38:41.730" style="s2">go</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.110" end="00:38:46.380" style="s2">oh no but we&#39;ve lost all of that in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.730" end="00:38:47.760" style="s2">cross there&#39;s so many more pieces are</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.380" end="00:38:50.580" style="s2">gonna have to talk about it again at</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.760" end="00:38:53.970" style="s2">some point just to bring a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.580" end="00:38:57.300" style="s2">them to bear I think was becoming</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.970" end="00:39:00.000" style="s2">salient to me is like the way of</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.300" end="00:39:02.430" style="s2">approaching the character of Christ or</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.000" end="00:39:04.320" style="s2">the scripture for me has to be done in</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.430" end="00:39:06.900" style="s2">the same way as one would approach a</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.320" end="00:39:08.400" style="s2">work of literature like I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.900" end="00:39:13.350" style="s2">it&#39;s a coincidence we have this great</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.400" end="00:39:15.360" style="s2">lineage of like literary excitation of</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.350" end="00:39:19.590" style="s2">the underlying meaning structures in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.360" end="00:39:24.600" style="s2">story of the Rings so forth and this</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.590" end="00:39:29.510" style="s2">this introduces a more interpretive mode</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.600" end="00:39:29.510" style="s2">of understanding which is</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.280" end="00:39:36.810" style="s2">and I think the other key component</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.250" end="00:39:39.870" style="s2">which kind of Zack is talking a little</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.810" end="00:39:41.280" style="s2">bit about and has you know kind of comes</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.870" end="00:39:44.010" style="s2">a lot out of the kind of psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.280" end="00:39:48.270" style="s2">Terence Mckenna lineage for me as well</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.010" end="00:39:55.470" style="s2">is about the primacy of experience and</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.270" end="00:39:57.810" style="s2">and that the key one of the key sort of</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.470" end="00:39:59.610" style="s2">axioms of making community work</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.810" end="00:40:01.590" style="s2">meaningfully is going to be that the</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.610" end="00:40:04.050" style="s2">individuals who constitute the community</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.590" end="00:40:07.400" style="s2">and themselves capable of leaving it</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.050" end="00:40:10.710" style="s2">going out and being on their own</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.400" end="00:40:16.140" style="s2">yes are to getting direct relationship</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.710" end="00:40:19.200" style="s2">to world and then you know coming back</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.140" end="00:40:21.060" style="s2">in but there has to be that sort of yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.200" end="00:40:23.130" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s really speaks to that</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.060" end="00:40:27.450" style="s2">experience that I was having in Orthodox</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.130" end="00:40:29.340" style="s2">churches it&#39;s like you know because of</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.450" end="00:40:31.770" style="s2">how much I&#39;ve kind of opened myself up</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.340" end="00:40:34.080" style="s2">I&#39;m getting a lot more walking down the</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.770" end="00:40:35.790" style="s2">street and observing day-to-day life</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.080" end="00:40:38.160" style="s2">than I am</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.790" end="00:40:40.680" style="s2">inside of the temple the temple is kind</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.160" end="00:40:42.150" style="s2">of like a big you know some days I I</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.680" end="00:40:43.830" style="s2">quite enjoy it and I find it</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.150" end="00:40:49.520" style="s2">contemplative but very often it feels</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.830" end="00:40:55.500" style="s2">like a bit of a trick almost like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.520" end="00:40:57.210" style="s2">it&#39;s like no let&#39;s try those two things</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.500" end="00:40:59.550" style="s2">together so Tolkien and the recovery</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.210" end="00:41:02.310" style="s2">theory right and so I think this is very</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.550" end="00:41:04.020" style="s2">much the token had an idea that rent</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.310" end="00:41:06.750" style="s2">there&#39;s two types of fantasy there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.020" end="00:41:08.970" style="s2">escapism which you know in entertainment</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.750" end="00:41:11.040" style="s2">and whatever right and then he had what</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.970" end="00:41:13.950" style="s2">he liked father&#39;s recovery theory and</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.040" end="00:41:15.420" style="s2">the idea is very much like what happens</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.950" end="00:41:16.980" style="s2">with when an anthropologist goes to</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.420" end="00:41:19.080" style="s2">another culture and has to go through</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.980" end="00:41:21.450" style="s2">the different process of enculturation</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.080" end="00:41:23.940" style="s2">and then the point is not just to see</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.450" end="00:41:25.830" style="s2">that other culture that point is very</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.940" end="00:41:27.780" style="s2">important it&#39;s a biological point it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.830" end="00:41:30.540" style="s2">not to create a treatise or a monograph</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.780" end="00:41:32.820" style="s2">the point is you and then when you</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.540" end="00:41:35.700" style="s2">return to this culture you see your</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.820" end="00:41:37.410" style="s2">culture of birth from the eyes of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.700" end="00:41:40.080" style="s2">other culture and you see it and you</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.410" end="00:41:42.090" style="s2">recover it you have an insight into it</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.080" end="00:41:44.490" style="s2">in a way you didn&#39;t and going into a</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.090" end="00:41:45.420" style="s2">church should be like that it should be</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.490" end="00:41:47.010" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.420" end="00:41:50.790" style="s2">and I mean this respectfully it should</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.010" end="00:41:52.770" style="s2">be a an enacted fantasy that right makes</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.790" end="00:41:56.220" style="s2">it possible for you to go out into the</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.770" end="00:41:58.290" style="s2">restraint and recover that world more</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.220" end="00:42:00.210" style="s2">powerfully I think in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.290" end="00:42:02.400" style="s2">religious practice is very much like</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.210" end="00:42:04.410" style="s2">augmented reality like you know the</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.400" end="00:42:06.300" style="s2">heads-up display of the pilot or when</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.410" end="00:42:09.030" style="s2">people are playing Pokemon on their</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.300" end="00:42:13.260" style="s2">phones and it&#39;s getting like we create a</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.030" end="00:42:17.160" style="s2">kind of imaginal pretense but not</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.260" end="00:42:20.160" style="s2">because it&#39;s false or or entertaining</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.160" end="00:42:22.890" style="s2">what it does is it actually takes us out</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.160" end="00:42:25.980" style="s2">of the familiar so that we can recover</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.890" end="00:42:27.870" style="s2">the familiar with unfamiliar eyes and we</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.980" end="00:42:29.370" style="s2">can see it more deeply more profoundly I</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.870" end="00:42:31.740" style="s2">think the point of going to church is</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.370" end="00:42:33.180" style="s2">exactly what happens when you leave the</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.740" end="00:42:34.980" style="s2">church not what&#39;s happening in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.180" end="00:42:37.830" style="s2">church I teach my students the exact</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.980" end="00:42:39.840" style="s2">same thing in meditation like the</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.830" end="00:42:42.510" style="s2">medicine don&#39;t think of meditation as a</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.840" end="00:42:45.510" style="s2">vacation think of an edge of it as an</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.510" end="00:42:48.870" style="s2">education introducing right and it and</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.510" end="00:42:50.610" style="s2">coming out of your your sitted practice</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.870" end="00:42:53.310" style="s2">is an integral part of your practice</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.610" end="00:42:55.980" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to carry over that affair</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.310" end="00:42:59.070" style="s2">I&#39;m metaphor transfer over what you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.980" end="00:43:01.200" style="s2">cultivated in your your sitting to your</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.070" end="00:43:03.390" style="s2">everyday consciousness cognition</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.200" end="00:43:06.150" style="s2">character and community on its that</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.390" end="00:43:07.710" style="s2">recovery that&#39;s the point of it I call</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.150" end="00:43:08.520" style="s2">this the sometimes call this the</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.710" end="00:43:10.560" style="s2">transworld</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.520" end="00:43:12.990" style="s2">your your your you&#39;re not going you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.560" end="00:43:16.080" style="s2">not moving between worlds you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.990" end="00:43:18.030" style="s2">into like a fantasy so in order to more</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.080" end="00:43:20.730" style="s2">deep and I mean this again powerfully in</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.030" end="00:43:22.950" style="s2">korban sense an imaginal thing so that</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.730" end="00:43:27.090" style="s2">you can more deeply return to this world</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.950" end="00:43:29.700" style="s2">in its depth and this is the correct</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.090" end="00:43:33.270" style="s2">understanding of how to relate to the</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.700" end="00:43:34.950" style="s2">mystical experience I think also you</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.270" end="00:43:38.460" style="s2">know bringing in the literary component</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.950" end="00:43:41.220" style="s2">its Frodo leaves the Shia goes on a big</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.460" end="00:43:43.350" style="s2">journey but at some point there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.220" end="00:43:44.880" style="s2">the return to the Shire but the Shire is</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.350" end="00:43:46.950" style="s2">not the same as before he went on the</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.880" end="00:43:49.560" style="s2">journey that&#39;s right that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.950" end="00:43:49.950" style="s2">that&#39;s right it&#39;s and he&#39;s not the same</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.560" end="00:43:52.680" style="s2">either</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.950" end="00:43:54.420" style="s2">right now we&#39;ve left the Shire and now</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.680" end="00:43:56.700" style="s2">we&#39;re just saying like oh none of that</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.420" end="00:43:59.850" style="s2">you know the last two thousand years</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.700" end="00:44:03.850" style="s2">don&#39;t worry about any of</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.850" end="00:44:06.790" style="s2">wherever well we have left the Shire and</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.850" end="00:44:08.770" style="s2">we haven&#39;t we&#39;re still a mess like we</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.790" end="00:44:11.650" style="s2">were talking about earlier and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.770" end="00:44:14.740" style="s2">ways but yeah I think if we could I</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.650" end="00:44:16.510" style="s2">really think I would really like to put</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.740" end="00:44:18.730" style="s2">you into contact with Paul van der clay</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.510" end="00:44:20.350" style="s2">and get you to go on his show and have a</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.730" end="00:44:22.120" style="s2">discussion with him I think he&#39;d be very</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.350" end="00:44:24.520" style="s2">interested in having a discussion with</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.120" end="00:44:28.620" style="s2">you I&#39;ve been thinking about reaching</p>
