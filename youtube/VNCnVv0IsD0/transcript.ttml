<p begin="00:00:20.369" end="00:00:25.830" style="s2">operative to get insight then we went</p>

<p begin="00:00:50.210" end="00:00:56.809" style="s2">stood up with moderate distraction with</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.160" end="00:00:59.789" style="s2">an intubation etc then we took a look at</p>

<p begin="00:00:59.789" end="00:01:05.549" style="s2">and we looked at Schillings theory of a</p>

<p begin="00:03:31.980" end="00:03:39.269" style="s2">the hardest part of all still needs to</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.099" end="00:03:42.800" style="s2">be done so this is the somewhat strange</p>

<p begin="00:03:42.800" end="00:03:48.380" style="s2">going to have to be lecturing about a</p>

<p begin="00:03:48.380" end="00:03:53.930" style="s2">is bizarre and of course can be</p>

<p begin="00:04:00.920" end="00:04:04.790" style="s2">can do it I&#39;ll try to presented is</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.060" end="00:04:07.640" style="s2">rationally responsibly weekend so what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.790" end="00:04:10.190" style="s2">listed what the issue the issue is can</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.640" end="00:04:12.920" style="s2">we address the central mechanism that</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.190" end="00:04:15.080" style="s2">still unaddressed that was at the core</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.920" end="00:04:17.600" style="s2">of why we started investigating insight</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.080" end="00:04:22.100" style="s2">which is relevance realization zeroing</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.600" end="00:04:24.260" style="s2">in on relevant information moreover can</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.100" end="00:04:27.440" style="s2">we do it in such a way that it</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.260" end="00:04:29.540" style="s2">integrates with this machinery that</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.440" end="00:04:31.760" style="s2">we&#39;ve discussed in the previous lecture</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.540" end="00:04:33.680" style="s2">can we understand relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.760" end="00:04:36.830" style="s2">in terms of an available Systems Theory</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.680" end="00:04:39.050" style="s2">and that makes use of ideas like self</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.830" end="00:04:41.450" style="s2">organize including supplemental to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.050" end="00:04:43.400" style="s2">Caribbean small world networks because</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.450" end="00:04:45.050" style="s2">if we could do that then of course we</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.400" end="00:04:47.300" style="s2">have the potential not the full</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.050" end="00:04:50.090" style="s2">actuality but we would have a potential</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.300" end="00:04:52.460" style="s2">of a formal logical theory an integrated</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.090" end="00:04:57.290" style="s2">theory of what&#39;s going on so what I want</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.460" end="00:05:04.000" style="s2">to do is try try to presented theory to</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.290" end="00:05:04.000" style="s2">you comes from basically three papers</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.020" end="00:05:10.579" style="s2">[Applause]</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.950" end="00:05:37.360" style="s2">there&#39;s also a manuscript unpublished</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.920" end="00:05:39.150" style="s2">manuscript that is not sort of picking</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.360" end="00:05:42.880" style="s2">out a life of its own in a circulating</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.150" end="00:05:52.870" style="s2">to the Internet I&#39;m not totally happy</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.880" end="00:05:59.290" style="s2">about that but so it&#39;s not beat it nikki</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.870" end="00:06:02.200" style="s2">purvy on connections to technology</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.290" end="00:06:07.770" style="s2">realization and periods of general</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.200" end="00:06:10.960" style="s2">intelligence so but it&#39;s out there and</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.770" end="00:06:13.150" style="s2">we wrote it around the same time as this</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.960" end="00:06:14.890" style="s2">was being with us so this is not a</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.150" end="00:06:18.090" style="s2">publication date that&#39;s been putting it</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.890" end="00:06:23.860" style="s2">in brackets sort of it was right around</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.090" end="00:06:26.320" style="s2">2010-2011 sometimes things get out of</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.860" end="00:06:29.900" style="s2">your hands right</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.320" end="00:06:32.360" style="s2">okay so what&#39;s the idea we need to come</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.900" end="00:06:35.690" style="s2">up with an account how relevance</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.360" end="00:06:37.960" style="s2">realization works and in way they could</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.690" end="00:06:39.910" style="s2">be theoretically and also importantly</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.960" end="00:06:42.470" style="s2">empirically as a formal mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.910" end="00:06:44.030" style="s2">measurement and prediction integrated</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.470" end="00:06:47.690" style="s2">with the machinery we&#39;ve been talking</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.030" end="00:06:49.340" style="s2">about that&#39;s at the core of insight so</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.690" end="00:06:50.960" style="s2">this will be hard for bit and then we</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.340" end="00:06:54.710" style="s2">will shift to the topic of creativity</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.960" end="00:07:02.120" style="s2">which is much more open much less sort</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.710" end="00:07:03.950" style="s2">of like that okay so the main thing to</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.120" end="00:07:05.360" style="s2">ask yourself is what would what we want</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.950" end="00:07:07.730" style="s2">to do is we want to course might analyze</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.360" end="00:07:09.440" style="s2">the phenomena relevance realization we</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.730" end="00:07:10.910" style="s2">want to try and see we want to try to</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.440" end="00:07:13.190" style="s2">explain it in terms of more basic</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.910" end="00:07:16.010" style="s2">processes and then hopefully we can</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.190" end="00:07:17.780" style="s2">formalize our visualization in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.010" end="00:07:20.690" style="s2">those make some more basic processes and</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.780" end="00:07:23.390" style="s2">then of course hopefully Megan either</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.690" end="00:07:26.090" style="s2">show that our conception of this is more</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.390" end="00:07:30.350" style="s2">accurate by putting it into a right</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.090" end="00:07:32.120" style="s2">computational neural network to machines</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.350" end="00:07:33.920" style="s2">and see if we&#39;re starting to create the</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.120" end="00:07:37.070" style="s2">phenomenon rather than just explain and</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.920" end="00:07:40.460" style="s2">state and all of that is being done for</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.070" end="00:07:41.960" style="s2">example vladats when it this is some</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.460" end="00:07:45.080" style="s2">little craft who was one of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.960" end="00:07:46.910" style="s2">designers of alphago some of you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.080" end="00:07:50.450" style="s2">this is the system that recently built</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.910" end="00:07:52.460" style="s2">beat go masters which is considered was</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.450" end="00:07:53.960" style="s2">considered a very recently something</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.460" end="00:07:55.720" style="s2">that an artificial intelligence could</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.960" end="00:07:59.630" style="s2">never do is feed a human being at time</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.720" end="00:08:01.970" style="s2">ok so this stuff is what I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.630" end="00:08:08.150" style="s2">announced its ongoing it&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.970" end="00:08:10.760" style="s2">right now ok so one of the things is you</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.150" end="00:08:12.470" style="s2">try to get the right level at which</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.760" end="00:08:15.050" style="s2">you&#39;re going to study relevance</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.470" end="00:08:16.760" style="s2">realization now one of the levels were</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.050" end="00:08:19.240" style="s2">very familiar with especially in</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.760" end="00:08:22.250" style="s2">psychology cognitive psychology is</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.240" end="00:08:23.810" style="s2">representational level super level which</p>

<p begin="00:10:25.860" end="00:10:30.270" style="s2">actually need a lot of relevance</p>

<p begin="00:12:45.870" end="00:12:50.660" style="s2">misdirected and in what sense you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.610" end="00:12:53.820" style="s2">right so the computational level is</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.660" end="00:12:57.230" style="s2">about being information being included</p>

<p begin="00:13:05.790" end="00:13:10.400" style="s2">propositional structure not the content</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.820" end="00:13:13.170" style="s2">and content is up here</p>

<p begin="00:13:23.830" end="00:13:33.820" style="s2">okay now of course there is a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:14:04.060" end="00:14:08.680" style="s2">putting forward this criticism it is</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.700" end="00:14:10.690" style="s2">very lacking of the pay very careful</p>

<p begin="00:15:35.579" end="00:15:39.029" style="s2">this when we talk a lot more about both</p>

<p begin="00:26:39.760" end="00:26:47.860" style="s2">things under this right horses and I can</p>

<p begin="00:26:57.940" end="00:27:02.230" style="s2">white things exist so white things</p>

<p begin="00:27:03.880" end="00:27:10.900" style="s2">yes okay now notice if I study a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.770" end="00:27:13.450" style="s2">of horses that will give me a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.900" end="00:27:16.480" style="s2">information about other horses that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.450" end="00:27:19.060" style="s2">going to find I will be able to make</p>

<p begin="00:28:35.210" end="00:28:39.380" style="s2">turn it you keep it flexing mr. pointed</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.490" end="00:28:41.630" style="s2">in a secure definition of what you not</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.380" end="00:28:48.169" style="s2">to talk about like the heat absorption</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.630" end="00:28:50.840" style="s2">as far as what we mean I like to but</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.169" end="00:28:52.700" style="s2">other than if those are all based on it</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.840" end="00:28:55.159" style="s2">being white other than it being white</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.700" end="00:28:57.320" style="s2">what is one of the things one of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.159" end="00:28:58.610" style="s2">properties were always big ship so there</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.320" end="00:28:59.840" style="s2">are things about being a horse is that</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.610" end="00:29:01.279" style="s2">all the properties you know how being a</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.840" end="00:29:03.470" style="s2">horse it depends the works and we</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.279" end="00:29:06.440" style="s2">decided by those properties as well</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.470" end="00:29:08.059" style="s2">where what ways would be saying we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.440" end="00:29:09.500" style="s2">look at other things can you tell me</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.059" end="00:29:11.090" style="s2">about this white thing of this white</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.500" end="00:29:11.899" style="s2">well the thing can you tell me but</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.090" end="00:29:13.850" style="s2">that&#39;s the point</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.899" end="00:29:19.970" style="s2">all you&#39;re doing is telling me some</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.850" end="00:29:23.059" style="s2">properties of white which are not ah but</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.970" end="00:29:26.629" style="s2">is this what what kind of properties are</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.059" end="00:29:28.279" style="s2">right it&#39;s not just brown right I can</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.629" end="00:29:30.289" style="s2">tell me all the different things about</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.279" end="00:29:33.200" style="s2">it you basically agree with me you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.289" end="00:29:35.750" style="s2">saying that this definition allows me to</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.200" end="00:29:38.029" style="s2">make a whole bunch of different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.750" end="00:29:39.799" style="s2">inferences and this one only allows me</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.029" end="00:29:43.580" style="s2">to give you all the different ways we</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.799" end="00:29:47.090" style="s2">talk about what I don&#39;t need to examine</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.580" end="00:29:50.240" style="s2">any of the white things at all to tell</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.090" end="00:29:52.250" style="s2">you that about like you I but I have to</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.240" end="00:29:54.980" style="s2">examine all the forces to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.250" end="00:29:57.259" style="s2">what the properties they are Bishop one</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.980" end="00:30:02.960" style="s2">is definitional the other requires</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.259" end="00:30:05.720" style="s2">empirical investigation yes did you</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.960" end="00:30:07.759" style="s2">argue that white is like horse so like</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.720" end="00:30:10.490" style="s2">the second part of white thing rather</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.759" end="00:30:14.960" style="s2">than just white well the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.490" end="00:30:18.019" style="s2">white right is it&#39;s not in and of itself</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.960" end="00:30:20.769" style="s2">like a thing me study it&#39;s part of how</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.019" end="00:30:24.710" style="s2">we study like light reflectance</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.769" end="00:30:26.450" style="s2">now I think that light is the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.710" end="00:30:30.049" style="s2">thing we can do is sign a song</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.450" end="00:30:33.619" style="s2">and we can but doing I mean we have a</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.049" end="00:30:36.470" style="s2">time to voices I mean that&#39;s the easy</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.619" end="00:30:39.669" style="s2">way to trust us doing how about top of</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.470" end="00:30:39.669" style="s2">these of all be involved</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.909" end="00:30:45.590" style="s2">we have balaji science of being involved</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.090" end="00:30:47.210" style="s2">other going to being grounded you can</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.590" end="00:30:48.559" style="s2">bounce it there&#39;s no other important</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.210" end="00:30:49.460" style="s2">properties doesn&#39;t tell you anything</p>

<p begin="00:30:49.460" end="00:30:55.309" style="s2">you can&#39;t discover anything more about</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.720" end="00:30:57.950" style="s2">the world at most and this is the point</p>

<p begin="00:31:06.830" end="00:31:14.269" style="s2">we can do a science on yes I understand</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.590" end="00:31:15.850" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying about why things do</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.269" end="00:31:18.409" style="s2">anything about them that we don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:31:20.600" end="00:31:25.100" style="s2">investigate differences in size we</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.460" end="00:31:27.080" style="s2">cannot simplify by being upon sure to</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.100" end="00:31:28.909" style="s2">look at horses but whether things of</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.080" end="00:31:31.100" style="s2">turns it affords a lot of things that</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.909" end="00:31:34.669" style="s2">people so understand is a definition of</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.100" end="00:31:38.509" style="s2">horse already have definitions in it</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.669" end="00:31:40.429" style="s2">such as like DNA and try to deny they</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.509" end="00:31:42.320" style="s2">should come about as we were able to do</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.429" end="00:31:44.239" style="s2">a science on horses something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.320" end="00:31:46.669" style="s2">part of the definition of metal it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.239" end="00:31:48.320" style="s2">weak at that definition and it turned</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.669" end="00:31:50.809" style="s2">out that the key to the science it could</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.320" end="00:31:53.480" style="s2">be back in to the definition you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.809" end="00:31:55.369" style="s2">arguing in a circle you&#39;re saying it has</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.480" end="00:32:01.609" style="s2">a scientific definition which is the</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.369" end="00:32:03.440" style="s2">point well we know it doesn&#39;t white</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.609" end="00:32:09.350" style="s2">things don&#39;t go changing when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.440" end="00:32:10.999" style="s2">copying available I think of what other</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.350" end="00:32:12.980" style="s2">than telling me that they&#39;re white what</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.999" end="00:32:14.659" style="s2">can you tell me about them I don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.980" end="00:32:16.549" style="s2">to tell you about anything else you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.659" end="00:32:18.590" style="s2">just been telling me that other than</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.549" end="00:32:20.659" style="s2">what is being horrible other than big</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.590" end="00:32:22.519" style="s2">enough okay first of all when when we</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.659" end="00:32:23.330" style="s2">fix things other sources we didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.519" end="00:32:27.800" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.330" end="00:32:29.270" style="s2">explosives right okay so they turned out</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.800" end="00:32:30.470" style="s2">that was a way of cutting up the world</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.270" end="00:32:32.540" style="s2">so that we could discover what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.470" end="00:32:34.720" style="s2">parts they had what kind of DNA they had</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.540" end="00:32:38.140" style="s2">and like that they actually mail</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.720" end="00:32:40.490" style="s2">discovering one more things about horses</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.140" end="00:32:41.720" style="s2">so it&#39;s got a bunch of white things book</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.490" end="00:32:44.330" style="s2">I picked out a bunch of things by</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.720" end="00:32:45.770" style="s2">rainbow you know my wife picked out all</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.330" end="00:32:48.830" style="s2">those things what do I learn about those</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.770" end="00:32:50.690" style="s2">things nothing I already do their wife</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.830" end="00:32:52.670" style="s2">is that&#39;s how I take so much yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.690" end="00:32:55.430" style="s2">then you also already knew that the</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.670" end="00:32:57.320" style="s2">first quarter no I didn&#39;t he knew about</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.430" end="00:32:59.300" style="s2">horses before we discovered everything</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.320" end="00:33:00.950" style="s2">we discovered about horses do you think</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.300" end="00:33:02.630" style="s2">back in empathy where they say they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.950" end="00:33:07.220" style="s2">the worst they knew everything you learn</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.630" end="00:33:09.890" style="s2">about horses white they also didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.220" end="00:33:11.900" style="s2">like the properties of shaking why there</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.890" end="00:33:12.350" style="s2">is nothing we can just no no that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.900" end="00:33:14.240" style="s2">the point</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.350" end="00:33:16.310" style="s2">I used that just as a way of picking on</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.240" end="00:33:17.510" style="s2">all the things there&#39;s nothing I can</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.310" end="00:33:20.770" style="s2">find that all those things have in</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.510" end="00:33:23.360" style="s2">common other than their bite and then</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.770" end="00:33:25.100" style="s2">they&#39;re biting Oh what are you going to</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.360" end="00:33:27.290" style="s2">start with more about one more left like</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.100" end="00:33:30.440" style="s2">me but then I&#39;m not talking about white</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.290" end="00:33:31.910" style="s2">things I&#39;m talking about white light and</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.440" end="00:33:33.890" style="s2">yes I can have a science of white light</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.910" end="00:33:35.300" style="s2">I&#39;d admit it back to you there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.890" end="00:33:38.090" style="s2">difference between the science of white</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.300" end="00:33:40.490" style="s2">light and experience series of sides of</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.090" end="00:33:44.500" style="s2">one thing you keep talking about white</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.490" end="00:33:44.500" style="s2">light and one part about white things</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.090" end="00:33:59.429" style="s2">okay so the point you want to play a</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.889" end="00:34:00.720" style="s2">tiny gap right is that when and you</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.429" end="00:34:02.460" style="s2">don&#39;t know what this is and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.720" end="00:34:04.470" style="s2">whole point of science we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.460" end="00:34:07.200" style="s2">which of the groupings is going to turn</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.470" end="00:34:09.829" style="s2">out to work this way but what we would</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.200" end="00:34:12.179" style="s2">have to start to happen according to</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.829" end="00:34:15.000" style="s2">know is we have some reason to believe</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.179" end="00:34:17.310" style="s2">that right the classification is going</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.000" end="00:34:29.399" style="s2">to be homogeneous it&#39;s going to share a</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.310" end="00:34:32.760" style="s2">lot of undiscovered properties now what</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.399" end="00:34:34.349" style="s2">else can be right you need the</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.760" end="00:34:42.750" style="s2">properties that you&#39;re doing your signs</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.349" end="00:34:45.510" style="s2">on to be intrinsic properties okay see</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.750" end="00:34:47.460" style="s2">what&#39;s the basic difference here okay so</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.510" end="00:34:50.129" style="s2">here&#39;s an attributed property this is</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.460" end="00:34:51.990" style="s2">you treat this as money it&#39;s only money</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.129" end="00:34:53.490" style="s2">because we all treat it that way if we</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.990" end="00:34:57.690" style="s2">stop treating it as money it&#39;s not to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.490" end="00:35:00.630" style="s2">any money okay now some things aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.690" end="00:35:02.670" style="s2">enough let&#39;s clear set this being a can</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.630" end="00:35:05.430" style="s2">is only a can because we attribute it</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.670" end="00:35:09.060" style="s2">that way if there were no human beings</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.430" end="00:35:11.130" style="s2">using it at the can it wouldn&#39;t be a can</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.060" end="00:35:13.440" style="s2">it would be this object with this map</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.130" end="00:35:16.140" style="s2">and notice what sucks that&#39;s why we can</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.440" end="00:35:17.579" style="s2">do a physics on its mass and itself in</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.140" end="00:35:20.460" style="s2">its structure but we can&#39;t do the</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.579" end="00:35:21.869" style="s2">physics on being you can there&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.460" end="00:35:23.069" style="s2">reason why I don&#39;t buy the way you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.869" end="00:35:26.040" style="s2">do a science or everything that you can</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.069" end="00:35:28.770" style="s2">label because not everything we label is</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.040" end="00:35:31.260" style="s2">an intrinsic property many times what we</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.770" end="00:35:32.850" style="s2">do is give it the Trinity properties by</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.260" end="00:35:34.400" style="s2">labeling of the living</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.850" end="00:35:37.640" style="s2">[Applause]</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.400" end="00:35:37.640" style="s2">all right</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.009" end="00:35:47.170" style="s2">so the class has to be homogenius the</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.640" end="00:35:53.170" style="s2">members have to share many many</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.170" end="00:35:55.119" style="s2">properties that allow you to discover</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.170" end="00:35:58.269" style="s2">more things about other members of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.119" end="00:36:00.880" style="s2">class those properties have to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.269" end="00:36:05.470" style="s2">intrinsic and of course it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.880" end="00:36:07.180" style="s2">stable the set of properties absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.470" end="00:36:09.099" style="s2">stable you can&#39;t make your inductive</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.180" end="00:36:11.559" style="s2">inference is across time or across</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.099" end="00:36:14.049" style="s2">contest it gold was constantly changing</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.559" end="00:36:15.509" style="s2">across time and across contexts we</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.049" end="00:36:17.859" style="s2">couldn&#39;t make conclusions</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.509" end="00:36:19.839" style="s2">generalizations of the nature of gold we</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.859" end="00:36:23.950" style="s2">couldn&#39;t say you know gold is behaving</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.839" end="00:36:26.289" style="s2">this way right on you know some sign it</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.950" end="00:36:28.029" style="s2">in some other solar system right but we</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.289" end="00:36:30.250" style="s2">can&#39;t say go to hit this way back in</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.029" end="00:36:34.140" style="s2">your 4000 BC eight coldest is in some</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.250" end="00:36:34.140" style="s2">sense fundamentally stable that&#39;s gear</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.630" end="00:36:59.200" style="s2">okay so the class has to be homogeneous</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.019" end="00:37:00.730" style="s2">Oh sir give me that&#39;s it okay now that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.200" end="00:37:04.599" style="s2">that that actually really feels soft at</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.730" end="00:37:06.789" style="s2">the interesting question because you</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.599" end="00:37:08.200" style="s2">can&#39;t put functional property cannot</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.789" end="00:37:10.839" style="s2">with muscle property you can see like</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.200" end="00:37:13.359" style="s2">ultimately the physics and this function</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.839" end="00:37:15.309" style="s2">is defined in terms of purpose and we</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.359" end="00:37:17.890" style="s2">sort of decided that physics and</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.309" end="00:37:19.680" style="s2">teleology don&#39;t act on purpose now</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.890" end="00:37:22.150" style="s2">there&#39;s a dispute about because maybe</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.680" end="00:37:23.470" style="s2">biological things act on purpose but if</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.150" end="00:37:25.240" style="s2">you say that you push it too strongly</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.470" end="00:37:27.609" style="s2">you get into that whole issue we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.240" end="00:37:31.150" style="s2">the cons that maybe you can&#39;t ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.609" end="00:37:35.289" style="s2">talk about living things in in a</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.150" end="00:37:37.050" style="s2">scientific way money like that money if</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.289" end="00:37:39.330" style="s2">we stop treating it</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.050" end="00:37:45.810" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean the Stephanie don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.330" end="00:37:47.490" style="s2">label right um so if you might want to</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.810" end="00:37:49.680" style="s2">say that ultimately anything that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.490" end="00:37:51.240" style="s2">attributed is ultimately also not stable</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.680" end="00:37:53.610" style="s2">because human beings might disappear</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.240" end="00:37:54.870" style="s2">I get that argument but the other way</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.610" end="00:37:58.340" style="s2">around but it doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.870" end="00:38:06.810" style="s2">everything that is stable is necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.340" end="00:38:08.910" style="s2">like intrinsic about how so what are you</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.810" end="00:38:12.030" style="s2">pointing to your point you like this is</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.910" end="00:38:17.040" style="s2">a goal and property so you have to make</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.030" end="00:38:21.990" style="s2">it stable right</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.040" end="00:38:23.790" style="s2">oh I see what you&#39;re saying how is it</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.990" end="00:38:25.590" style="s2">possible to ever have stable with it I</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.790" end="00:38:29.550" style="s2">thank you don&#39;t you guys table without</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.590" end="00:38:31.920" style="s2">be intrinsic that&#39;s okay I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.550" end="00:38:34.050" style="s2">that we think that also intrinsic things</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.920" end="00:38:35.940" style="s2">are necessarily stable across all times</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.050" end="00:38:37.830" style="s2">in context something like a singularity</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.940" end="00:38:39.420" style="s2">of the Big Bang probably you trinsic we</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.830" end="00:38:43.590" style="s2">existed but it don&#39;t make me think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.420" end="00:38:45.390" style="s2">a stable thing so and then that&#39;s why in</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.590" end="00:38:47.070" style="s2">a technical sense you can&#39;t do and</p>

<p begin="00:39:34.569" end="00:39:39.130" style="s2">but that&#39;s exactly right so what did we</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.490" end="00:39:42.040" style="s2">give up we gave up trying to have a</p>

<p begin="00:40:13.390" end="00:40:19.000" style="s2">can see why is criticism is so</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.400" end="00:40:21.609" style="s2">penetrating it&#39;s not like it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.000" end="00:40:27.270" style="s2">happen it&#39;s just a long way to go you</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.609" end="00:40:30.339" style="s2">can&#39;t have a theory of that but that</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.270" end="00:40:31.990" style="s2">just is reinforcing evidence and effect</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.339" end="00:40:34.930" style="s2">the connection I wanted to make with</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.990" end="00:40:38.740" style="s2">thank you that&#39;s why you can&#39;t have a</p>

<p begin="00:40:38.740" end="00:40:43.630" style="s2">same reasons but sorry you can&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.500" end="00:40:44.740" style="s2">degree of relevance what you can do it</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.630" end="00:40:47.589" style="s2">you can have a theory of relevance</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.740" end="00:40:49.329" style="s2">realization you can have a theory of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.589" end="00:40:51.490" style="s2">process being to go teach you how</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.329" end="00:40:56.740" style="s2">relatively new lies even though you</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.490" end="00:40:58.660" style="s2">can&#39;t have a theory of relevance just</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.740" end="00:41:01.150" style="s2">like we shifted from trying to come up</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.660" end="00:41:02.950" style="s2">with a formal theory of insight to try</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.150" end="00:41:08.140" style="s2">to come up to a formal period like</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.950" end="00:41:12.609" style="s2">inside problem-solving this is what we</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.140" end="00:41:20.740" style="s2">need to do here - we need theory of</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.609" end="00:41:22.780" style="s2">relevance realization now so one and one</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.740" end="00:41:24.040" style="s2">strong connection I may just make if you</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.780" end="00:41:27.790" style="s2">could probably think of another one that</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.040" end="00:41:30.210" style="s2">we made last time right because we know</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.790" end="00:41:31.980" style="s2">what those kinds of theories look like</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.210" end="00:41:34.050" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.980" end="00:41:36.300" style="s2">so for example remember I pointed out</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.050" end="00:41:40.880" style="s2">that Darwin gave up the project of</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.300" end="00:41:40.880" style="s2">trying to find a definition of fitness</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.260" end="00:41:48.570" style="s2">because if you take the class of 50</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.440" end="00:41:49.890" style="s2">things some are big some are small some</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.570" end="00:41:52.470" style="s2">are thought some are slow some are hard</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.890" end="00:41:57.060" style="s2">something like there is no acids to</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.470" end="00:41:59.130" style="s2">being thick and remember what he did was</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.060" end="00:42:01.320" style="s2">instead of trying to find the perfection</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.130" end="00:42:03.270" style="s2">that the Nationalists were looking for</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.320" end="00:42:05.790" style="s2">he looked instead for a dynamical</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.270" end="00:42:07.830" style="s2">systems theory of how design was</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.790" end="00:42:14.760" style="s2">constantly evolving for previous</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.830" end="00:42:17.450" style="s2">instances of design and again we forget</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.760" end="00:42:21.060" style="s2">how insightful that was that was a big</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.450" end="00:42:22.740" style="s2">huge move it was brilliant like I said I</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.060" end="00:42:24.780" style="s2">think the theory of evolution by natural</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.740" end="00:42:29.640" style="s2">selection is one of the top five</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.780" end="00:42:34.560" style="s2">theories ever produced in science but</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.640" end="00:42:36.510" style="s2">here&#39;s the idea what yeah what if that</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.560" end="00:42:43.140" style="s2">how we should be thinking of relevance</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.510" end="00:42:45.000" style="s2">realization what let me start it as an</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.140" end="00:42:47.250" style="s2">analogy but turn it something into</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.000" end="00:42:53.430" style="s2">something more like a derivation right</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.250" end="00:42:55.890" style="s2">what yep relevance realization is some</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.430" end="00:43:00.180" style="s2">kind of virtual engine of cost functions</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.890" end="00:43:01.680" style="s2">that regulates the feedback that like</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.180" end="00:43:07.910" style="s2">the informational feedback between your</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.680" end="00:43:10.560" style="s2">brain and environment such that like</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.910" end="00:43:12.510" style="s2">your problem-solving abilities are</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.560" end="00:43:14.760" style="s2">always if you&#39;ll allow me first as an</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.510" end="00:43:19.080" style="s2">analogy ml trying to specify are always</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.760" end="00:43:21.150" style="s2">evolving they&#39;re fitted &#39;no student or</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.080" end="00:43:24.510" style="s2">to use language from the course then in</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.150" end="00:43:26.580" style="s2">addition to heuristics there are cost</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.510" end="00:43:29.250" style="s2">functions and virtual additions of cost</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.580" end="00:43:32.120" style="s2">functions that constrain the</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.250" end="00:43:36.590" style="s2">problem-solving space so as to regularly</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.120" end="00:43:36.590" style="s2">avoid combinatorial explosion</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.989" end="00:43:47.029" style="s2">what would that look like well</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.349" end="00:43:47.959" style="s2">interestingly and this is part of what</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.029" end="00:43:49.279" style="s2">we were talking about here you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.959" end="00:43:52.189" style="s2">talking about a convergent framework</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.279" end="00:43:55.039" style="s2">that was emerging more and more people</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.189" end="00:43:57.199" style="s2">are talking about these logistical cost</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.039" end="00:44:00.199" style="s2">functions these cost functions and their</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.199" end="00:44:02.989" style="s2">logistical norms regulating all of right</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.199" end="00:44:07.069" style="s2">all of intelligence for example right</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.989" end="00:44:09.289" style="s2">now you might have heard attrition first</p>

<p begin="00:44:09.289" end="00:44:15.229" style="s2">principle right basically the community</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.699" end="00:44:17.479" style="s2">fixity he called he said it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:44:17.479" end="00:44:21.829" style="s2">cognitive science so it&#39;s probably for</p>

<p begin="00:44:35.809" end="00:44:39.769" style="s2">example and there are many and you can</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.579" end="00:44:41.839" style="s2">read the paper in these thinkers to find</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.769" end="00:44:45.499" style="s2">all of these examples what is basically</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.839" end="00:44:48.229" style="s2">arguing is right there&#39;s a that</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.499" end="00:44:56.809" style="s2">ultimately your brain is trying to avoid</p>

<p begin="00:46:37.920" end="00:46:44.310" style="s2">last week what you also always need</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.170" end="00:46:46.980" style="s2">resiliency if you need a trade-off</p>

<p begin="00:46:46.980" end="00:46:50.700" style="s2">want to maximize efficiency Barbara so</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.080" end="00:46:59.570" style="s2">they see you want to optimize the</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.700" end="00:47:01.710" style="s2">relationship between them right and we</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.570" end="00:47:04.830" style="s2">argue that one of the ways of optimizing</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.710" end="00:47:09.350" style="s2">the relationship between them is to do a</p>

<p begin="00:47:15.300" end="00:47:18.270" style="s2">deliberately this serves the time or</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.980" end="00:47:22.200" style="s2">more tightly to what we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.270" end="00:47:24.180" style="s2">last week because of course the way you</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.200" end="00:47:26.820" style="s2">try and make your processing as</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.180" end="00:47:30.600" style="s2">efficient as possible is you want</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.820" end="00:47:32.430" style="s2">increase generalization this</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.600" end="00:47:34.350" style="s2">generalization means I can use the same</p>

<p begin="00:47:34.350" end="00:47:39.930" style="s2">that means my functionality has become</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.260" end="00:47:43.650" style="s2">more and more efficient where I could</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.930" end="00:47:44.940" style="s2">generalize right but what was the what</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.650" end="00:47:48.770" style="s2">was the important thing you needed to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.940" end="00:47:58.079" style="s2">able to do is remember that discriminate</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.770" end="00:47:59.460" style="s2">differentiate and you know you know this</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.079" end="00:48:01.140" style="s2">in psychology we&#39;re always trading</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.460" end="00:48:02.369" style="s2">between generalizability and individual</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.140" end="00:48:04.230" style="s2">differences generalizability of</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.369" end="00:48:06.900" style="s2">individual differences in fact what I</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.230" end="00:48:08.640" style="s2">guarantee you at any conference if</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.900" end="00:48:10.530" style="s2">somebody stands up and says walk walk</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.640" end="00:48:12.300" style="s2">and proposes some generalize with some</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.530" end="00:48:13.890" style="s2">generalized function somebody in their</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.300" end="00:48:15.690" style="s2">hand the audience will put up their hand</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.890" end="00:48:17.010" style="s2">then either ability is is there a lot</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.690" end="00:48:17.730" style="s2">about individual differences with the</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.010" end="00:48:19.470" style="s2">ba-ba-ba-ba</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.730" end="00:48:21.450" style="s2">and everybody goes on yes that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.470" end="00:48:23.670" style="s2">yeah because that&#39;s just part of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.450" end="00:48:26.099" style="s2">deal right yes there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.670" end="00:48:27.869" style="s2">generalization like discrimination right</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.099" end="00:48:30.300" style="s2">there&#39;s a generalization like upon</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.869" end="00:48:32.369" style="s2">discrimination no I&#39;m not using</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.300" end="00:48:34.170" style="s2">discrimination in the political sense oh</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.369" end="00:48:36.810" style="s2">no no but like that&#39;s because like you</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.170" end="00:48:39.359" style="s2">can&#39;t generalize oh my job these are</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.810" end="00:48:40.770" style="s2">relative so if I generalize a function</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.359" end="00:48:44.070" style="s2">it means I can interpolate and</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.770" end="00:48:45.660" style="s2">extrapolate it right hmm so what does</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.070" end="00:48:47.790" style="s2">that mean how is that discriminatory</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.660" end="00:48:49.140" style="s2">because like if you if you generalize</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.790" end="00:48:51.060" style="s2">like all courses have these</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.140" end="00:48:53.160" style="s2">characteristics you&#39;re differentiating</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.060" end="00:48:55.500" style="s2">that both horses from let&#39;s say like</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.160" end="00:48:57.119" style="s2">like ponies were Wow but then you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.500" end="00:48:58.619" style="s2">generalizing when you&#39;re descriptive way</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.119" end="00:49:00.630" style="s2">you&#39;re differentiating courses from</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.619" end="00:49:02.670" style="s2">zebras then what you&#39;re what you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.630" end="00:49:04.710" style="s2">doing is of the larger classes of that</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.670" end="00:49:09.319" style="s2">coin you have differentiating them into</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.710" end="00:49:11.760" style="s2">two subclasses okay so because ation has</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.319" end="00:49:14.190" style="s2">subcategories that word is what way of</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.760" end="00:49:15.990" style="s2">thinking with as you move up this is</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.190" end="00:49:18.589" style="s2">only one instance this is not everything</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.990" end="00:49:21.660" style="s2">I&#39;m saying as you move up a taxonomic</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.589" end="00:49:24.599" style="s2">hierarchy you&#39;re generalizing and as you</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.660" end="00:49:26.520" style="s2">move down you&#39;re discriminative like a</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.599" end="00:49:28.530" style="s2">joy addition this Commission bless look</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.520" end="00:49:29.339" style="s2">laughing more like like a process that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.530" end="00:49:38.069" style="s2">exactly the point</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.339" end="00:49:39.750" style="s2">yes okay now some of the work I did was</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.069" end="00:49:41.550" style="s2">about how to talk about this and if you</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.750" end="00:49:44.970" style="s2">want the specific than the map look at</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.550" end="00:49:48.839" style="s2">the 2012 paper I&#39;m not going to move</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.970" end="00:49:51.829" style="s2">that on you guys now but the interesting</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.839" end="00:49:53.700" style="s2">thing here is the way you get</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.829" end="00:49:54.460" style="s2">generalization is you&#39;re doing a data</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.700" end="00:50:01.059" style="s2">compression</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.460" end="00:50:03.040" style="s2">I just did it like I&#39;m going to talk</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.059" end="00:50:06.520" style="s2">about this you have to scatter fought</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.040" end="00:50:09.190" style="s2">and you do the line of best fit so you</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.520" end="00:50:11.740" style="s2">can interpolate an externality so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.190" end="00:50:14.349" style="s2">what data compression does right so</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.740" end="00:50:16.000" style="s2">whenever you&#39;re trying to generalize</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.349" end="00:50:17.829" style="s2">you&#39;re running some kind of regression</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.000" end="00:50:19.300" style="s2">function of it on that worth like weight</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.829" end="00:50:21.339" style="s2">decay or something like that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.300" end="00:50:23.500" style="s2">many different ways doing it and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.339" end="00:50:27.970" style="s2">unclear which one the terrain is</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.500" end="00:50:30.630" style="s2">specifically music I in general that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.970" end="00:50:33.400" style="s2">all I need to talk about right now I</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.630" end="00:50:34.569" style="s2">mean up the level of the biological</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.400" end="00:50:34.869" style="s2">level I&#39;m not talking at the functional</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.569" end="00:50:36.940" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.869" end="00:50:39.880" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t the need for the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.940" end="00:50:43.349" style="s2">thing in the literature we invented it</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.880" end="00:50:49.809" style="s2">but people now seem to be using it so</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.349" end="00:50:52.030" style="s2">call it particular ization oh this is</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.809" end="00:50:56.010" style="s2">when you try and write and when you try</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.030" end="00:50:59.980" style="s2">and over fit to the data rather than</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.010" end="00:51:01.420" style="s2">interpolated why would you want to over</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.980" end="00:51:02.859" style="s2">fit to the data what does it allow you</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.420" end="00:51:06.309" style="s2">to do what kind of function does that</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.859" end="00:51:07.859" style="s2">allow you to create it allows you it</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.309" end="00:51:10.930" style="s2">allows you to create a special purpose</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.859" end="00:51:14.760" style="s2">machine that only works in very four</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.930" end="00:51:16.660" style="s2">varies for a very limited data set</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.760" end="00:51:24.780" style="s2">sometimes you want special purpose</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.660" end="00:51:24.780" style="s2">machines okay</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.150" end="00:51:31.590" style="s2">so what we have is we have this these</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.410" end="00:51:34.830" style="s2">bio economic right as we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.590" end="00:51:37.710" style="s2">last time while an economic logistical</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.830" end="00:51:43.040" style="s2">norms that work in terms of cost</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.710" end="00:51:47.880" style="s2">functions and we can talk about write a</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.040" end="00:51:50.100" style="s2">system up constraints in the brain all</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.880" end="00:51:56.690" style="s2">right virtual engine now what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.100" end="00:51:58.550" style="s2">interesting is you seen this before</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.690" end="00:52:01.980" style="s2">remember what did you see it before</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.550" end="00:52:03.870" style="s2">switching the gradual well that&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.980" end="00:52:06.480" style="s2">of it and that&#39;s that&#39;s at a very high</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.870" end="00:52:08.370" style="s2">level but more abstractly what did we</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.480" end="00:52:10.830" style="s2">see this one it&#39;s time this is just self</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.370" end="00:52:12.660" style="s2">organizing opponent well criticality</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.830" end="00:52:16.020" style="s2">because what happened is when the</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.660" end="00:52:17.970" style="s2">neurons are finding sympathy they need</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.020" end="00:52:20.280" style="s2">to be new date compression they oughta</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.970" end="00:52:23.610" style="s2">latch they differentiate this to degrade</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.280" end="00:52:25.770" style="s2">out particular eyes so that new and then</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.610" end="00:52:28.260" style="s2">they recompress imagine they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.770" end="00:52:31.940" style="s2">constantly oscillating between these</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.260" end="00:52:31.940" style="s2">this is self-organizing propellant</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.099" end="00:52:45.130" style="s2">yes also farm up and scale invariance</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.660" end="00:52:47.369" style="s2">that&#39;s right it&#39;s recursive in scale and</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.130" end="00:52:50.980" style="s2">variance</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.369" end="00:52:52.990" style="s2">now that&#39;s right it&#39;s right be careful</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.980" end="00:52:54.940" style="s2">when we originally do this this was a</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.990" end="00:52:56.260" style="s2">prediction that well the business was</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.940" end="00:52:58.119" style="s2">going to stay we originally prediction</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.260" end="00:52:59.910" style="s2">and then they tended to post actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.119" end="00:53:06.130" style="s2">they received a beautiful combination</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.910" end="00:53:11.260" style="s2">okay so arguing that this could</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.130" end="00:53:14.050" style="s2">implement this right yes so I organized</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.260" end="00:53:16.000" style="s2">a panic allottee does this and this is</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.050" end="00:53:20.020" style="s2">the way in which the brain in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.000" end="00:53:22.480" style="s2">can be constantly optimizing right its</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.020" end="00:53:25.240" style="s2">logistics so that it&#39;s constantly</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.480" end="00:53:28.560" style="s2">evolving it&#39;s fitted this for problem</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.240" end="00:53:28.560" style="s2">solving in the world</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.700" end="00:53:35.410" style="s2">now what this course says argue is that</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.070" end="00:53:37.750" style="s2">this is the core of problem solving and</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.410" end="00:53:38.890" style="s2">the core of problem solving right and</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.750" end="00:53:43.630" style="s2">problem solving is the court of</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.890" end="00:53:45.220" style="s2">intelligence right so that you to be</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.630" end="00:53:46.450" style="s2">intelligent is to be a general problem</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.220" end="00:53:48.690" style="s2">small but that&#39;s how we started this</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.450" end="00:53:48.690" style="s2">course</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.730" end="00:53:59.630" style="s2">again I can&#39;t give you the full argument</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.590" end="00:54:02.420" style="s2">here you can see more of it here leo is</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.630" end="00:54:04.800" style="s2">psycho psychometrist he does</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.420" end="00:54:07.920" style="s2">intelligence a stimulant so we get work</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.800" end="00:54:09.060" style="s2">right building this argument but I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.920" end="00:54:11.550" style="s2">already given your version of this</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.060" end="00:54:12.870" style="s2">argument so there&#39;s more there basically</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.550" end="00:54:14.070" style="s2">what we&#39;re measuring when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.870" end="00:54:15.420" style="s2">measuring intelligence is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.070" end="00:54:17.160" style="s2">measuring existence the property</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.420" end="00:54:19.650" style="s2">development railroad which a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.160" end="00:54:21.270" style="s2">people are converging on this standard</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.650" end="00:54:23.430" style="s2">is for example in his recent book what</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.270" end="00:54:25.020" style="s2">intelligence test myths makes the</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.430" end="00:54:26.190" style="s2">argument that what we&#39;re measuring what</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.020" end="00:54:27.570" style="s2">we&#39;re measuring intelligence is</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.190" end="00:54:29.970" style="s2">basically the ability to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.570" end="00:54:32.760" style="s2">computational limitations that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.970" end="00:54:36.570" style="s2">what common explosion so again a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.760" end="00:54:40.500" style="s2">convergence on this idea so if this is</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.570" end="00:54:42.540" style="s2">all right if this is self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.500" end="00:54:43.410" style="s2">criticality can implement all that</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.540" end="00:54:45.360" style="s2">realization</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.410" end="00:54:46.770" style="s2">intelligence realization is the core of</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.360" end="00:54:48.900" style="s2">your intelligence in general</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.770" end="00:54:52.020" style="s2">intelligence what should there be</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.900" end="00:54:53.250" style="s2">between this and this what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.020" end="00:54:54.510" style="s2">relationships are there make sure they</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.250" end="00:54:56.160" style="s2">should they be uncorrelated</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.510" end="00:54:58.400" style="s2">I&#39;m sedate which are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.160" end="00:55:01.260" style="s2">independent they should be highly like</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.400" end="00:55:03.600" style="s2">having correlated and now we have ways</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.260" end="00:55:05.250" style="s2">of measuring this and of course we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.600" end="00:55:06.600" style="s2">had centuries of getting ways of</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.250" end="00:55:08.940" style="s2">measuring map so that&#39;s my contribution</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.600" end="00:55:10.710" style="s2">maybe you know that measures of general</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.940" end="00:55:17.180" style="s2">intelligence are the best constructs in</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.710" end="00:55:20.180" style="s2">technology ok that&#39;s exact saturate out</p>

<p begin="00:55:26.569" end="00:55:35.750" style="s2">sure there&#39;s hunter it out basically</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.589" end="00:55:41.150" style="s2">they&#39;re more flexible your rate is that</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.750" end="00:55:42.349" style="s2">sock the more intelligent one there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.150" end="00:55:43.910" style="s2">been quite a bit of work since then you</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.349" end="00:55:46.040" style="s2">can look at that if you picked I</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.910" end="00:55:47.869" style="s2">mentioned last week about sort of why</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.040" end="00:55:51.470" style="s2">that would be the case it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.869" end="00:55:55.190" style="s2">zeroing in on this now that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.470" end="00:55:58.190" style="s2">cool because right the right we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.190" end="00:56:01.099" style="s2">getting an account of how the brain is</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.190" end="00:56:02.750" style="s2">probably doing relevance realization</p>

<p begin="00:56:13.430" end="00:56:20.230" style="s2">there are really constraining the search</p>

<p begin="00:56:21.130" end="00:56:27.140" style="s2">now we also said there was something</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.770" end="00:56:29.119" style="s2">else that optimize for the relationship</p>

<p begin="00:56:40.609" end="00:56:49.990" style="s2">you remember that so small world</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.160" end="00:56:52.490" style="s2">networks would also in with the away of</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.990" end="00:56:55.880" style="s2">implementing relevance realization yes</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.490" end="00:57:00.380" style="s2">the relevance realization is the dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.880" end="00:57:02.720" style="s2">optimization between efficiency and</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.380" end="00:57:06.500" style="s2">resiliency right and small little</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.720" end="00:57:08.780" style="s2">networks are doing that as well then we</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.500" end="00:57:14.200" style="s2">should be able to do the same thing we</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.780" end="00:57:14.200" style="s2">should be able to do that right</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.440" end="00:57:19.790" style="s2">so the more your brain is wiring like a</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.170" end="00:57:21.710" style="s2">small world network is still in very</p>

<p begin="00:57:48.960" end="00:57:54.660" style="s2">over here we&#39;re just trying to solve</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.220" end="00:57:55.890" style="s2">this sort of core problem is at least I</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.660" end="00:57:57.360" style="s2">mean there&#39;s other machinery that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.890" end="00:57:59.280" style="s2">going on in relevance realize this and</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.360" end="00:58:01.950" style="s2">this is one talked about other things</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.280" end="00:58:03.540" style="s2">like what a processing between exploring</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.950" end="00:58:06.360" style="s2">and exploiting and stuff like that but</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.540" end="00:58:09.000" style="s2">here&#39;s what we did talked about and</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.360" end="00:58:10.380" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting about it is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.000" end="00:58:12.420" style="s2">getting more and more empirical</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.380" end="00:58:16.230" style="s2">conformation this were just the first</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.420" end="00:58:18.180" style="s2">two right and what&#39;s deeply I think very</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.230" end="00:58:19.710" style="s2">interesting for this course is that very</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.180" end="00:58:21.360" style="s2">same machinery the machinery had</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.710" end="00:58:29.370" style="s2">independent people we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.360" end="00:58:33.690" style="s2">to explain inside we have the</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.370" end="00:58:38.640" style="s2">possibility right of a genuine formal</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.690" end="00:58:42.180" style="s2">theory not insight it can&#39;t be such a</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.640" end="00:58:44.540" style="s2">thing but what&#39;s going on in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.180" end="00:58:44.540" style="s2">problem solving</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.110" end="00:58:51.630" style="s2">inside problem solving possibly as we</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.520" end="00:58:53.190" style="s2">talked about a lot of time was right and</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.630" end="00:58:55.440" style="s2">there is a fundamental relationship</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.190" end="00:58:59.220" style="s2">between this kind of violating this kind</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.440" end="00:59:01.410" style="s2">of wiring insight is making use of this</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.220" end="00:59:02.820" style="s2">machinery but what was missing from the</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.410" end="00:59:04.500" style="s2">theory of insight is just but how&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.820" end="00:59:06.210" style="s2">relevance realization going on about</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.500" end="00:59:08.900" style="s2">machinery there is how what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.210" end="00:59:08.900" style="s2">in that machinery</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.410" end="00:59:17.670" style="s2">the same machinery that we use to</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.030" end="00:59:19.700" style="s2">explain insight is part of a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.670" end="00:59:23.460" style="s2">theory of explaining how the brain</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.700" end="00:59:25.680" style="s2">avoids combinatorial explosion how the</p>

<p begin="00:59:27.840" end="00:59:50.930" style="s2">constrains the search space this is the</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.590" end="00:59:53.930" style="s2">hardest part of the whole course but not</p>

<p begin="00:59:56.310" end="01:00:07.440" style="s2">so the gradual increase in criticality</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.050" end="01:00:11.460" style="s2">in a sense yes what I mean so one of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.440" end="01:00:16.320" style="s2">things you can do is you could train</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.460" end="01:00:18.330" style="s2">your cognition to get better at creating</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.320" end="01:00:21.690" style="s2">greater and greater integrations of</p>

<p begin="01:00:21.690" end="01:00:25.010" style="s2">you also have to train it at getting</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.100" end="01:00:27.540" style="s2">better better breaking those up now</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.010" end="01:00:32.640" style="s2">where are we seeing a kind of practice</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.540" end="01:00:35.570" style="s2">that does that for you what army I</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.640" end="01:00:41.430" style="s2">didn&#39;t hear what you&#39;re saying yeah</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.570" end="01:00:43.080" style="s2">mindfulness now here&#39;s where you can get</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.430" end="01:00:44.670" style="s2">it to theoretical problems and Senator</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.080" end="01:00:46.530" style="s2">Chuck she wrestles with this again I</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.670" end="01:00:48.990" style="s2">mean she says you have a lot of a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.530" end="01:00:50.550" style="s2">piece of you want does that mean we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.990" end="01:00:52.920" style="s2">changing our intelligence the problem is</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.550" end="01:00:54.300" style="s2">if we do not then we&#39;re blurring a</p>

<p begin="01:00:54.300" end="01:01:00.230" style="s2">important we should reserve the term</p>

<p begin="01:01:11.180" end="01:01:17.010" style="s2">of problem-solving like hey you acquire</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.130" end="01:01:18.690" style="s2">skills right then we should stop talking</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.010" end="01:01:23.820" style="s2">about intelligence we should stop</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.690" end="01:01:25.830" style="s2">evoke rationality and see and then</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.820" end="01:01:28.500" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a full argument about the</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.830" end="01:01:30.480" style="s2">fact that you can show very powerfully</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.500" end="01:01:32.250" style="s2">that you can get just as strong positive</p>

<p begin="01:01:36.600" end="01:01:40.590" style="s2">can take those two manifolds and you can</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.670" end="01:01:42.720" style="s2">ask how tightly are they correlated with</p>

<p begin="01:03:57.660" end="01:04:01.499" style="s2">so you understand what I&#39;m saying it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.729" end="01:04:03.419" style="s2">not like I&#39;m saying God is above and</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.499" end="01:04:07.380" style="s2">saying no this is intelligence and this</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.419" end="01:04:09.179" style="s2">is nationality he&#39;s saying like we keep</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.380" end="01:04:10.890" style="s2">them apart because that way we avoid</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.179" end="01:04:17.479" style="s2">theoretical confusion and we get</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.890" end="01:04:20.549" style="s2">empirical clarity is that okay okay</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.479" end="01:04:22.619" style="s2">people there are there studies they show</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.549" end="01:04:25.439" style="s2">over time that people of intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.619" end="01:04:28.799" style="s2">change like invisible IQ they&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.439" end="01:04:30.179" style="s2">not measuring up changes brush Valley so</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.799" end="01:04:31.949" style="s2">which measures you mean within an</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.179" end="01:04:35.999" style="s2">individual I mean across generations</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.949" end="01:04:37.709" style="s2">like this one of them I feel like</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.999" end="01:04:40.079" style="s2">physically people take it and get</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.709" end="01:04:42.539" style="s2">different result that will stuff like</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.079" end="01:04:44.429" style="s2">the likes of Aaron saying it okay yeah</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.539" end="01:04:46.709" style="s2">so yeah there&#39;s a lot of controversy</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.429" end="01:04:49.469" style="s2">about how stable it is or not there</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.709" end="01:04:52.219" style="s2">seems to be some education that you can</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.469" end="01:04:53.730" style="s2">do things so take it like this that you</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.219" end="01:04:56.080" style="s2">focus</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.730" end="01:04:59.260" style="s2">right there seems to be some indication</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.080" end="01:05:03.100" style="s2">that people might be capable of altering</p>

<p begin="01:05:03.100" end="01:05:11.080" style="s2">make an impact on your fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.900" end="01:05:13.810" style="s2">intelligence don&#39;t know okay here&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.080" end="01:05:15.880" style="s2">you do by the way another thing that</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.810" end="01:05:17.710" style="s2">correlates very well with measures of</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.880" end="01:05:25.420" style="s2">intelligence are managers of working</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.710" end="01:05:28.840" style="s2">memory but why might that be the case</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.420" end="01:05:31.690" style="s2">given what we&#39;re saying here what&#39;s hot</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.840" end="01:05:33.300" style="s2">he talked a bit about this and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.690" end="01:05:35.920" style="s2">two different models of working memory</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.300" end="01:05:37.720" style="s2">okay so one model is the tabletop model</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.920" end="01:05:39.970" style="s2">right at the Miller model you have a</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.720" end="01:05:41.500" style="s2">limited space so it&#39;s like your counter</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.970" end="01:05:42.730" style="s2">looking memory your counter and your</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.500" end="01:05:44.770" style="s2">long-term storage is your kitchen</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.730" end="01:05:46.060" style="s2">cupboard and you bring stuff out you put</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.770" end="01:05:47.980" style="s2">it on the counter if you do stuff and</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.060" end="01:05:50.380" style="s2">then you put it away and then you have</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.980" end="01:05:52.300" style="s2">limited space the problem with the</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.380" end="01:05:55.120" style="s2">limited counter model mrs.lin hashers</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.300" end="01:05:59.920" style="s2">workers saluting somebody sit tool stop</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.120" end="01:06:03.150" style="s2">what does it is explain how can you get</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.920" end="01:06:09.540" style="s2">more stuff through working memory</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.150" end="01:06:09.540" style="s2">chunking and what is it to make a chunk</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.870" end="01:06:15.220" style="s2">to find pieces of information relevant</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.820" end="01:06:17.530" style="s2">to each other and then you subjectively</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.220" end="01:06:19.060" style="s2">organize it which is code for saying you</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.530" end="01:06:21.310" style="s2">make sure that it&#39;s highly relevant to</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.060" end="01:06:23.890" style="s2">you you do lock the relevance</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.310" end="01:06:26.500" style="s2">realization her model is that working</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.890" end="01:06:30.280" style="s2">memory is a relevant filter it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.500" end="01:06:32.790" style="s2">higher-order relevant filter lines up</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.280" end="01:06:32.790" style="s2">with all of this</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.200" end="01:06:42.190" style="s2">ah sure she&#39;s here at your feet she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.660" end="01:06:44.590" style="s2">brilliant what she can tell me the</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.190" end="01:06:46.810" style="s2">coolest research is that and this is</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.590" end="01:06:49.480" style="s2">this could go towards supporting what</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.810" end="01:06:51.010" style="s2">Chloe was just saying and maybe messing</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.480" end="01:06:53.380" style="s2">things up even more but it&#39;s exciting</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.010" end="01:06:54.970" style="s2">and interesting not because we had this</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.380" end="01:06:58.240" style="s2">sort of standard model that as people</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.970" end="01:07:01.330" style="s2">get older they get stupider because</p>

<p begin="01:07:06.340" end="01:07:12.520" style="s2">that is disaster right because again</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.850" end="01:07:15.010" style="s2">right you&#39;re thinking of they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.520" end="01:07:17.380" style="s2">emphasizing one side of this what is</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.010" end="01:07:18.550" style="s2">turning out is and she&#39;s now they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.380" end="01:07:21.280" style="s2">done several studies there was one that</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.550" end="01:07:25.620" style="s2">was just in the news last week right it</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.280" end="01:07:27.970" style="s2">was actually meet that goons Wow right</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.620" end="01:07:30.750" style="s2">but a lot of its converging on the idea</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.970" end="01:07:33.400" style="s2">that older brains or wider grins</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.750" end="01:07:35.350" style="s2">because what they do is they don&#39;t as</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.400" end="01:07:37.420" style="s2">rapidly screen off a lot of stuff that</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.350" end="01:07:40.000" style="s2">has on depend on them to bring in I</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.420" end="01:07:42.820" style="s2">don&#39;t want that I look at alcohol I did</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.000" end="01:07:45.160" style="s2">work better than your coffee but older</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.820" end="01:07:48.090" style="s2">brains actually don&#39;t screen off as</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.160" end="01:07:52.080" style="s2">rapidly like they don&#39;t ignore as much</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.090" end="01:07:54.400" style="s2">irrelevant things and so what happens is</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.080" end="01:07:56.110" style="s2">once if our older brains tend to be</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.400" end="01:07:57.820" style="s2">wiser they could just see connections</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.110" end="01:08:02.920" style="s2">and have insights that younger brains</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.820" end="01:08:05.650" style="s2">aren&#39;t capable of doing especially get</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.920" end="01:08:09.700" style="s2">this in ill-defined messy social</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.650" end="01:08:15.560" style="s2">situations so we shouldn&#39;t be checking</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.700" end="01:08:19.580" style="s2">our people away after all so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.560" end="01:08:22.100" style="s2">you know again that&#39;s of course that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.580" end="01:08:25.760" style="s2">going to be affected by how nasty they</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.100" end="01:08:28.010" style="s2">are interest they are how horrible new</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.760" end="01:08:29.750" style="s2">life is gone and all that stuff but the</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.010" end="01:08:33.200" style="s2">research is right there&#39;s been now</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.750" end="01:08:34.460" style="s2">several studies okay we got it we got a</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.200" end="01:08:36.859" style="s2">stop soon okay</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.460" end="01:08:39.109" style="s2">yes um I guess like looking at this like</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.859" end="01:08:41.260" style="s2">unless I don&#39;t impose that on I</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.109" end="01:08:43.250" style="s2">registered but I&#39;ve talked about how</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.260" end="01:08:46.940" style="s2">philosophy majors have like one of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.250" end="01:08:48.350" style="s2">highest IQs on a book at nature and it</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.940" end="01:08:50.060" style="s2">just like it&#39;s occurred to me that like</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.350" end="01:08:52.819" style="s2">philosophy acquires a lot of like</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.060" end="01:08:55.280" style="s2">grading frame making frames and it would</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.819" end="01:08:56.870" style="s2">make sense that like a person who&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.280" end="01:08:58.549" style="s2">could have philosophy would be better at</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.870" end="01:08:59.990" style="s2">like relevance realization therefore</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.549" end="01:09:02.900" style="s2">they have a higher that&#39;s the old</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.990" end="01:09:07.250" style="s2">argument I mean we do this a lot of 371</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.900" end="01:09:10.339" style="s2">the idea that job what the primary job</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.250" end="01:09:12.890" style="s2">is of philosophy is to Train rationality</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.339" end="01:09:15.970" style="s2">where again I&#39;m asking you not to hear</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.890" end="01:09:18.530" style="s2">the word rationality as meaning logic</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.970" end="01:09:20.330" style="s2">its meaning optimizing your imprints</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.530" end="01:09:21.950" style="s2">optimizing your insight optimizing your</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.330" end="01:09:23.540" style="s2">intuition optimizing your ability to</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.950" end="01:09:25.069" style="s2">internalize other people&#39;s perspectives</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.540" end="01:09:27.799" style="s2">these are all the things that ancient</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.069" end="01:09:30.230" style="s2">philosophy talked a lot about and so the</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.799" end="01:09:31.730" style="s2">degree to which you&#39;re doing those</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.230" end="01:09:35.210" style="s2">things in philosophy is that reads which</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.730" end="01:09:36.710" style="s2">you&#39;re training the abilities now just</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.210" end="01:09:38.120" style="s2">to be a little bit more self-critical</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.710" end="01:09:43.490" style="s2">and I have a degree in philosophy so</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.120" end="01:09:46.670" style="s2">long to do it there&#39;s a lot of criticism</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.490" end="01:09:49.609" style="s2">within sort of academic philosophy that</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.670" end="01:09:51.770" style="s2">academic philosophy has not until very</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.609" end="01:09:55.160" style="s2">recently been concerning itself very</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.770" end="01:09:58.400" style="s2">much with wisdom it has gotten locked</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.160" end="01:10:00.800" style="s2">into conceptual analysis and has has</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.400" end="01:10:02.660" style="s2">only recently gone back to the ancient</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.800" end="01:10:05.060" style="s2">idea that the primary function of</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.660" end="01:10:06.830" style="s2">philosophy is to Train rationality again</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.060" end="01:10:11.930" style="s2">broadly construed in the way that I just</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.830" end="01:10:14.810" style="s2">indicated so I would say yes to you but</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.930" end="01:10:19.760" style="s2">with that important qualification all</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.810" end="01:10:22.300" style="s2">right okay so we&#39;re now done talking</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.760" end="01:10:22.300" style="s2">about inside</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.150" end="01:10:27.450" style="s2">what else is our kitchen I mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.680" end="01:10:30.690" style="s2">more science to do but what I mean is</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.450" end="01:10:33.660" style="s2">what I tried to show you is that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.690" end="01:10:44.239" style="s2">sort of beyond both to search inference</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.660" end="01:10:49.080" style="s2">framework and additional framework and</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.239" end="01:10:50.660" style="s2">we&#39;re increasingly using a cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.080" end="01:10:53.010" style="s2">science theory of the coast of pure</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.660" end="01:10:55.050" style="s2">psychology theory there&#39;s all these lots</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.010" end="01:10:57.600" style="s2">of psychology what we&#39;ve been doing but</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.050" end="01:10:59.160" style="s2">neuroscience and ideas from artificial</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.600" end="01:11:01.620" style="s2">intelligence are playing an increasing</p>

<p begin="01:11:06.050" end="01:11:11.730" style="s2">yeah the question I run Eternity wins</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.520" end="01:11:17.520" style="s2">and get going and then we&#39;ll take a</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.730" end="01:11:20.040" style="s2">break in event right is the question</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.520" end="01:11:21.420" style="s2">that was brought up in one of the</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.040" end="01:11:23.850" style="s2">previous lectures and then was</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.420" end="01:11:25.680" style="s2">specifically brought by the market Boden</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.850" end="01:11:26.940" style="s2">who comes out of the search efforts</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.680" end="01:11:29.850" style="s2">framework the computational framework</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.940" end="01:11:33.360" style="s2">this was you know a book originally a</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.850" end="01:11:37.910" style="s2">1990 Margaret Bolton and this is the</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.360" end="01:11:42.190" style="s2">question whether or not creativity is</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.910" end="01:11:45.229" style="s2">anything above and beyond inside</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.190" end="01:11:45.229" style="s2">[Applause]</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.540" end="01:12:03.330" style="s2">so what both in fact argues is her</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.820" end="01:12:04.290" style="s2">theory our creativity is basically read</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.330" end="01:12:07.020" style="s2">she made the distinction between</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.290" end="01:12:12.450" style="s2">personal and what she calls historical</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.020" end="01:12:14.520" style="s2">creativity personal creativity is</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.450" end="01:12:16.320" style="s2">basically when you change your problem</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.520" end="01:12:18.810" style="s2">space because that you&#39;re capable of</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.320" end="01:12:25.410" style="s2">coming to a conclusion that you couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.810" end="01:12:26.820" style="s2">come to before historical creativity is</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.410" end="01:12:29.040" style="s2">when an individual does that for a</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.820" end="01:12:30.720" style="s2">shared problem space so there&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.040" end="01:12:33.120" style="s2">problem that a bunch of us can&#39;t share</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.720" end="01:12:35.790" style="s2">somebody comes along go no but we can</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.120" end="01:12:40.680" style="s2">figure the public space this way we go</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.790" end="01:12:43.260" style="s2">ah and then we can solve our problem now</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.680" end="01:12:44.580" style="s2">I don&#39;t think she would disagree with</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.260" end="01:12:47.730" style="s2">this what I&#39;m going to say basically</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.580" end="01:12:51.360" style="s2">what she&#39;s saying that is creativity is</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.730" end="01:12:53.850" style="s2">just deep inside creativity is you</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.360" end="01:12:57.210" style="s2">couldn&#39;t think of something restructure</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.850" end="01:13:00.020" style="s2">the problem space and now you can think</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.210" end="01:13:03.030" style="s2">of it that&#39;s it that&#39;s creativity</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.020" end="01:13:04.830" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying she&#39;s right I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.030" end="01:13:07.440" style="s2">that this was this question was brought</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.830" end="01:13:09.840" style="s2">up and I&#39;m using her as somebody an</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.440" end="01:13:10.950" style="s2">important thinker in the field who seems</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.840" end="01:13:12.030" style="s2">to advance</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.950" end="01:13:14.160" style="s2">I think you make it a strong</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.030" end="01:13:17.040" style="s2">interpretive case that she&#39;s dancing the</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.160" end="01:13:19.950" style="s2">thesis that creativity is just a synonym</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.040" end="01:13:21.810" style="s2">for insight we can get a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.950" end="01:13:23.790" style="s2">clearer what creativity is with what</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.810" end="01:13:25.770" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to emphasize sort of you</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.790" end="01:13:28.080" style="s2">know how radical these insight is sort</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.770" end="01:13:32.340" style="s2">of how influential or important it is to</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.080" end="01:13:34.830" style="s2">you as an individual or to a group so</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.340" end="01:13:36.510" style="s2">that brings up the question then or is</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.830" end="01:13:39.290" style="s2">that it is that all of the common</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.510" end="01:13:43.680" style="s2">machine eree that&#39;s going on in insight</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.290" end="01:13:45.390" style="s2">now what I want to do okay so obviously</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.680" end="01:13:46.740" style="s2">you already know and I told you this</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.390" end="01:13:48.690" style="s2">ahead of time there&#39;s somebody who jumps</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.740" end="01:13:50.760" style="s2">on that bandwagon and says there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.690" end="01:13:54.500" style="s2">nothing to creativity it doesn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.760" end="01:13:56.990" style="s2">exist it who might that be right Bert</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.500" end="01:13:59.750" style="s2">that&#39;s where he has papers on that run</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.990" end="01:14:04.280" style="s2">when I take the car to the movie but due</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.750" end="01:14:06.620" style="s2">to cars releases okay so but what what</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.280" end="01:14:07.850" style="s2">does instead do the opposite because</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.620" end="01:14:10.310" style="s2">although many of you are immediately</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.850" end="01:14:12.260" style="s2">shaking you&#39;re doing this not even yes</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.310" end="01:14:13.850" style="s2">there&#39;s much more to creativity trying</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.260" end="01:14:15.800" style="s2">to get that going and establishing that</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.850" end="01:14:18.670" style="s2">turns out to be really hard</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.800" end="01:14:22.790" style="s2">so whatever totals to you the first</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.670" end="01:14:24.200" style="s2">hypothesis we&#39;ll take a look at and then</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.790" end="01:14:25.400" style="s2">after give you the proposal to take a</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.200" end="01:14:28.220" style="s2">break and then take a look at it okay</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.400" end="01:14:29.570" style="s2">here&#39;s the first hypothesis is that when</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.220" end="01:14:31.310" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about creativity we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.570" end="01:14:34.540" style="s2">talking about another process that is</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.310" end="01:14:36.500" style="s2">used to trigger insight so nobody denies</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.540" end="01:14:38.030" style="s2">let&#39;s be clear about this nobody denies</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.500" end="01:14:48.200" style="s2">that insight has an important role in</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.030" end="01:14:50.570" style="s2">creativity it&#39;s possible to be creative</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.200" end="01:14:53.540" style="s2">without it being insightful yeah there</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.570" end="01:14:55.220" style="s2">is insight required like expressing the</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.540" end="01:14:57.440" style="s2">problem you can solve before then you</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.220" end="01:15:00.020" style="s2">solve it right so it can be creative</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.440" end="01:15:02.690" style="s2">without having a problem right right and</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.020" end="01:15:04.880" style="s2">so that&#39;s a good point and that&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.690" end="01:15:07.270" style="s2">because - so let me what I should have</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.880" end="01:15:09.500" style="s2">been more clear what I meant by</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.270" end="01:15:15.320" style="s2">everybody thinks that insight is in some</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.500" end="01:15:17.150" style="s2">sense relevant to creativity Zoe&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.320" end="01:15:20.450" style="s2">so it sounds like really close right</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.150" end="01:15:21.860" style="s2">because what some people will argue will</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.450" end="01:15:23.930" style="s2">see this later is that although</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.860" end="01:15:25.310" style="s2">creativity is using the shame machinery</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.930" end="01:15:26.810" style="s2">of insight is using it in a</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.310" end="01:15:30.200" style="s2">fundamentally different way that we</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.810" end="01:15:32.120" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t call them sight so we&#39;ll come</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.200" end="01:15:35.870" style="s2">back to that but the first proposal is</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.120" end="01:15:38.510" style="s2">this idea right that so what creativity</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.870" end="01:15:41.710" style="s2">is is basically the use of analogy in</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.510" end="01:15:41.710" style="s2">order to provoke inside</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.790" end="01:15:54.230" style="s2">and this is a very popular idea now I</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.240" end="01:15:56.240" style="s2">although there&#39;s a distinction between</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.230" end="01:15:57.830" style="s2">these two terms the distinction doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.240" end="01:16:00.350" style="s2">turn out to be highly relevant in this</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.830" end="01:16:01.850" style="s2">discussion so when I say analogy I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.350" end="01:16:05.090" style="s2">also thinking I&#39;m extending it to mean</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.850" end="01:16:06.650" style="s2">things like metaphor as well even though</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.090" end="01:16:09.800" style="s2">they&#39;re not the exact same thing I got</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.650" end="01:16:13.790" style="s2">that but but here&#39;s a theory of</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.800" end="01:16:17.090" style="s2">creativity creative person is somebody</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.790" end="01:16:21.020" style="s2">who knows how to use analogy in order to</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.090" end="01:16:22.880" style="s2">provoke insight which sounds very</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.020" end="01:16:28.850" style="s2">documents is that - with a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.880" end="01:16:30.410" style="s2">discourses of creativity so here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.850" end="01:16:33.800" style="s2">first thing the first time you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.410" end="01:16:35.330" style="s2">to look at this is to say right yes</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.800" end="01:16:37.490" style="s2">instead just playing a rule but instead</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.330" end="01:16:39.410" style="s2">is much more kind of the result of</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.490" end="01:16:41.330" style="s2">creativity it&#39;s not identical to</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.410" end="01:16:50.270" style="s2">creativity there&#39;s creativity zooming</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.330" end="01:16:52.610" style="s2">analogy to provoke inside ok so what</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.270" end="01:16:55.340" style="s2">this DV depends on of course is an</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.610" end="01:16:57.200" style="s2">independence of analogy insight and the</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.340" end="01:17:03.550" style="s2">capacity to be able to explain how an</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.200" end="01:17:03.550" style="s2">old analogy causes insight correct yes</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.780" end="01:17:11.390" style="s2">I&#39;m talking about well I don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.830" end="01:17:13.220" style="s2">was going to answer you then I thought I</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.390" end="01:17:14.780" style="s2">know how you think what we said come to</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.220" end="01:17:18.790" style="s2">know how you think what do you mean by</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.780" end="01:17:18.790" style="s2">that well as opposed to like</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.560" end="01:17:23.620" style="s2">sure it is you&#39;re solving all kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.540" end="01:17:32.980" style="s2">problems when you&#39;re trying to make are</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.620" end="01:17:35.290" style="s2">it&#39;s not right okay so but why does it</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.980" end="01:17:37.360" style="s2">have to be the case so if it&#39;s not about</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.290" end="01:17:39.880" style="s2">solving problems does that mean that any</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.360" end="01:17:43.740" style="s2">random generation of new things by the</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.880" end="01:17:43.740" style="s2">financial environment is creativity</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.240" end="01:17:49.540" style="s2">okay then there is a product that is out</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.980" end="01:17:51.340" style="s2">there it&#39;s not a proper part of</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.540" end="01:17:53.110" style="s2">psychology and we should stop talking</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.340" end="01:18:02.560" style="s2">about it in psychology it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.110" end="01:18:04.260" style="s2">physical chemistry right that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.560" end="01:18:07.240" style="s2">asking you</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.260" end="01:18:09.250" style="s2">okay the problem is if you if you remove</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.240" end="01:18:12.190" style="s2">it if you remove the idea that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.250" end="01:18:13.450" style="s2">pursuing a goal then you have to give me</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.190" end="01:18:15.550" style="s2">another way of distinguishing it from</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.450" end="01:18:18.160" style="s2">all the other non-role directive things</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.550" end="01:18:20.110" style="s2">and don&#39;t just say a human did because</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.160" end="01:18:23.740" style="s2">that&#39;s to the bestest model in the very</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.110" end="01:18:29.020" style="s2">point we&#39;re trying to clarify the</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.740" end="01:18:30.580" style="s2">problem area is usually like one crank</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.020" end="01:18:32.710" style="s2">okay now you&#39;re saying something better</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.580" end="01:18:34.240" style="s2">keep going across people we&#39;re all gonna</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.710" end="01:18:36.160" style="s2">look for the same sort of solutions</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.240" end="01:18:37.570" style="s2">where is it you gave a bunch of people</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.160" end="01:18:40.960" style="s2">the task of making that particular</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.570" end="01:18:45.000" style="s2">sports signal well no I mean to some</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.960" end="01:18:47.980" style="s2">degree I mean it has to have Sami</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.000" end="01:18:50.920" style="s2">intelligibility right like I can&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.980" end="01:18:53.460" style="s2">call something and that that&#39;s enough</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.920" end="01:18:56.310" style="s2">right so is that weird</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.460" end="01:18:58.290" style="s2">so then so what you&#39;re not suggesting we</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.310" end="01:18:59.670" style="s2">should say that gives an idea the month</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.290" end="01:19:02.010" style="s2">wedding miss and of course or maybe</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.670" end="01:19:04.730" style="s2">creativity is the kind of problem</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.010" end="01:19:08.010" style="s2">solving in which multiple solutions are</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.730" end="01:19:09.660" style="s2">available to you now that is a good</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.010" end="01:19:11.610" style="s2">thing to say but then we have to how do</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.660" end="01:19:14.850" style="s2">we distinguish that just from really</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.610" end="01:19:16.440" style="s2">easy to solve problems because one of</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.850" end="01:19:18.390" style="s2">the defining features are really easy</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.440" end="01:19:21.150" style="s2">really easy to solve problems are that</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.390" end="01:19:22.469" style="s2">they have many equally good answers</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.150" end="01:19:24.630" style="s2">because that means you can get to your</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.469" end="01:19:25.980" style="s2">goals take many different pathways to</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.630" end="01:19:28.219" style="s2">the search space and you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.980" end="01:19:31.050" style="s2">say that creativity is the same as</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.219" end="01:19:34.980" style="s2">solving easy to solve problems it might</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.050" end="01:19:36.570" style="s2">be harder okay so now it&#39;s tricky now</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.980" end="01:19:39.179" style="s2">you got to tell me how it can have</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.570" end="01:19:44.489" style="s2">multiple answers and yet still be harder</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.179" end="01:19:46.800" style="s2">than an input problem yes yes so I think</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.489" end="01:19:49.290" style="s2">one thing is you&#39;re saying if it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.800" end="01:19:50.910" style="s2">a random generation of things that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.290" end="01:19:53.790" style="s2">really creativity it&#39;s not useful I</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.910" end="01:19:55.590" style="s2">think some in some ways crazy it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.790" end="01:19:58.350" style="s2">random generation of things does it have</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.590" end="01:20:00.330" style="s2">the effect because we don&#39;t all think</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.350" end="01:20:02.760" style="s2">that the same things are creative it</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.330" end="01:20:04.440" style="s2">need to be useful so mother art painter</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.760" end="01:20:06.420" style="s2">might be like oh this is so creative and</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.440" end="01:20:07.590" style="s2">so moms like no that&#39;s terrible why</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.420" end="01:20:08.699" style="s2">would who pay money for that because</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.590" end="01:20:11.460" style="s2">they don&#39;t think it&#39;s creative cuz they</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.699" end="01:20:13.350" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s useful true so then it</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.460" end="01:20:14.850" style="s2">is in sense like one part right of</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.350" end="01:20:17.580" style="s2">generation 1 part personal</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.850" end="01:20:19.469" style="s2">interpretation based on usefulness which</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.580" end="01:20:21.110" style="s2">is already like they&#39;re not clearly</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.469" end="01:20:24.210" style="s2">defined parent which relates to</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.110" end="01:20:26.550" style="s2">relevance cooking also determined how</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.210" end="01:20:29.820" style="s2">it&#39;s not necessarily solving a problem</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.550" end="01:20:31.560" style="s2">because you look at the person is just</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.820" end="01:20:34.050" style="s2">creating stuff I mean they&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.560" end="01:20:36.600" style="s2">creating it so people to them so it</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.050" end="01:20:40.920" style="s2">could be a problem hoping that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.600" end="01:20:42.120" style="s2">making but it helpful like well ok well</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.920" end="01:20:43.800" style="s2">you said many different things that I</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.120" end="01:20:46.080" style="s2">can&#39;t respond to all</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.800" end="01:20:48.000" style="s2">but one thing is I&#39;m still having</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.080" end="01:20:49.910" style="s2">difficulty seeing how the random</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.000" end="01:20:53.160" style="s2">generation that somebody finds useful</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.910" end="01:20:54.750" style="s2">would be a good definite because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.160" end="01:20:58.110" style="s2">happening all the time it&#39;s happening in</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.750" end="01:20:59.940" style="s2">this room all there&#39;s lots of sort of</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.110" end="01:21:01.170" style="s2">random happening and you can find</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.940" end="01:21:04.230" style="s2">some of it useful that we just put a</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.170" end="01:21:06.420" style="s2">mine story is that all we want to say</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.230" end="01:21:08.040" style="s2">creativity it maybe we did it and</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.420" end="01:21:09.450" style="s2">finally death and then we should stop</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.040" end="01:21:11.580" style="s2">talking about it in psychology because</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.450" end="01:21:15.450" style="s2">it&#39;s not part of psychology it&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.580" end="01:21:16.680" style="s2">the chemistry or physics but presumably</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.450" end="01:21:28.110" style="s2">that&#39;s not what these people want to</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.680" end="01:21:31.260" style="s2">talk about yes picking out their asses</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.110" end="01:21:33.180" style="s2">so I mean are you even are you going to</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.260" end="01:21:35.219" style="s2">pass or am I being separate here are you</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.180" end="01:21:37.739" style="s2">even ok with that because if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.219" end="01:21:43.500" style="s2">randomness then is it make sense to call</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.739" end="01:21:45.900" style="s2">an individual creative so they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.500" end="01:21:53.880" style="s2">random that they&#39;re reliably generating</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.900" end="01:21:55.830" style="s2">useful novelty oh yeah ok so if you want</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.880" end="01:21:57.030" style="s2">creativity to be something in psychology</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.830" end="01:21:59.340" style="s2">that you could attribute to people</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.030" end="01:22:01.050" style="s2">you&#39;ve got you&#39;ve got to tighten up what</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.340" end="01:22:04.800" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about it if you don&#39;t and</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.050" end="01:22:07.380" style="s2">we like this is ultimately a semantics</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.800" end="01:22:09.930" style="s2">debate class for how we look here able</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.380" end="01:22:12.090" style="s2">to do do we want to talk about it as a</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.930" end="01:22:14.400" style="s2">psychological property that individuals</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.090" end="01:22:17.070" style="s2">is that then we&#39;re limited in how we</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.400" end="01:22:18.300" style="s2">have to define if we don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.070" end="01:22:19.890" style="s2">that&#39;s fine but then we&#39;re no longer</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.300" end="01:22:26.160" style="s2">doing it&#39;s not a proper part of this</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.890" end="01:22:29.200" style="s2">course very idea that you have to</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.160" end="01:22:32.110" style="s2">recreate it implies that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.200" end="01:22:34.450" style="s2">but it could be that you are solving a</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.110" end="01:22:36.130" style="s2">problem without realizing without</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.450" end="01:22:39.460" style="s2">bearing the problems in mind</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.130" end="01:22:40.870" style="s2">sure so of what you were saying which is</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.460" end="01:22:43.030" style="s2">some other people say is that what</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.870" end="01:22:47.110" style="s2">happens in creativity is the goal its</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.030" end="01:22:48.310" style="s2">background it&#39;s not for gravity but then</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.110" end="01:22:49.660" style="s2">not when you&#39;re talking about that this</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.310" end="01:22:51.220" style="s2">is another important factor to bring</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.660" end="01:22:53.020" style="s2">that is now we&#39;re not saying the</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.220" end="01:22:55.210" style="s2">cognitive machinery so much is different</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.020" end="01:22:56.710" style="s2">but the motivational apprehension of</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.210" end="01:22:59.020" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing is different and</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.710" end="01:23:00.970" style="s2">that&#39;s one that&#39;s one theory of</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.020" end="01:23:02.710" style="s2">creativity that basically you&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.970" end="01:23:05.320" style="s2">the same cognitive machinery but your</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.710" end="01:23:07.120" style="s2">motivation your motivational framing of</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.320" end="01:23:09.600" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing is different than when</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.120" end="01:23:11.950" style="s2">you&#39;re square you&#39;re doing more pursuit</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.600" end="01:23:13.660" style="s2">by the way before that goes on that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.950" end="01:23:15.040" style="s2">big thing right now this is a big</p>

<p begin="01:23:15.040" end="01:23:21.400" style="s2">auto-pilot behavior right so even if the</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.850" end="01:23:22.840" style="s2">machinery is the same the process has to</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.400" end="01:23:24.850" style="s2">be different because when you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.840" end="01:23:26.830" style="s2">to solve a problem you have to I guess</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.850" end="01:23:29.230" style="s2">you have to a mental representation of</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.830" end="01:23:31.510" style="s2">that problem but in creativity is not</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.230" end="01:23:34.660" style="s2">like a thing you start with annajura</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.510" end="01:23:44.860" style="s2">meditation you start by making something</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.660" end="01:23:47.680" style="s2">or do you like a cup so I know a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.860" end="01:23:49.720" style="s2">efficiency will here simply and then</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.680" end="01:23:53.960" style="s2">start writing it so absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.720" end="01:23:55.100" style="s2">also like me people would argue and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.960" end="01:23:56.750" style="s2">going to be important to determine the</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.100" end="01:23:59.720" style="s2">topics definitely one of the most</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.750" end="01:24:01.760" style="s2">creative forms of music is jazz but if</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.720" end="01:24:03.530" style="s2">you talk they do look you can&#39;t be good</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.760" end="01:24:05.510" style="s2">jazz and we&#39;ve done a lot of fun music</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.530" end="01:24:10.130" style="s2">thing it&#39;s sort of randomly sort of</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.510" end="01:24:15.290" style="s2">switched and go to the Condor okay so</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.130" end="01:24:18.410" style="s2">you&#39;re interested so in order to make</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.290" end="01:24:21.500" style="s2">this work we are going to have to take a</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.410" end="01:24:25.160" style="s2">look at their analogies most theories of</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.500" end="01:24:27.860" style="s2">analogy our responses to in variations</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.160" end="01:24:30.320" style="s2">on probably dominant theory of analogy</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.860" end="01:24:32.690" style="s2">in psychology which is neither gantner&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.320" end="01:24:34.700" style="s2">theory of analogy which is known as the</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.690" end="01:24:39.050" style="s2">structure mapping theory the structure</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.700" end="01:24:41.090" style="s2">mapping theorem and once I explain it to</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.050" end="01:24:43.970" style="s2">you what it is it would become readily</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.090" end="01:24:45.920" style="s2">apparent how analogy might be the engine</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.970" end="01:24:47.410" style="s2">driving insight and then this would give</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.920" end="01:24:50.300" style="s2">us an account of what creativity is</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.410" end="01:24:54.050" style="s2">created people know how they have the</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.300" end="01:24:56.180" style="s2">skills right in order to use analogy and</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.050" end="01:24:58.370" style="s2">I don&#39;t just mean verbal analogy tango</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.180" end="01:25:00.950" style="s2">pictorial analogy pictorial metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.370" end="01:25:02.630" style="s2">Israel acoustic all kinds of mixtures</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.950" end="01:25:05.270" style="s2">analogies and music as you know</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.630" end="01:25:07.340" style="s2">eccentric cetera okay so when I hear</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.270" end="01:25:10.940" style="s2">that when I say this word don&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.340" end="01:25:13.580" style="s2">make verbal analogy okay the property to</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.940" end="01:25:15.350" style="s2">use analogy to drive into so feed you</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.580" end="01:25:17.650" style="s2">get there and the structure mapping</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.350" end="01:25:17.650" style="s2">theory</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.320" end="01:25:37.920" style="s2">all right so let me first of all a</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.670" end="01:25:42.780" style="s2">theory up for you intuitively and then</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.920" end="01:25:45.990" style="s2">how she formalizes it okay so the main</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.780" end="01:25:48.960" style="s2">idea is that what you&#39;re doing in an</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.990" end="01:25:55.050" style="s2">analogy is you&#39;re trying to find the</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.960" end="01:25:59.190" style="s2">important relations within mumuga okay</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.050" end="01:26:02.490" style="s2">so good luck just Energon source and</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.190" end="01:26:06.090" style="s2">target okay so of course is where I know</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.490" end="01:26:08.520" style="s2">or what I&#39;m using in order to try and</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.090" end="01:26:12.870" style="s2">change how picking about something else</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.520" end="01:26:14.940" style="s2">so let&#39;s make a concrete your brother</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.870" end="01:26:17.760" style="s2">for Boris you&#39;re trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.940" end="01:26:21.740" style="s2">the structure of the atom and what</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.760" end="01:26:25.050" style="s2">happened is and you use the solar system</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.740" end="01:26:27.450" style="s2">okay so this is the source solar system</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.050" end="01:26:29.220" style="s2">yeah it turns ugly wrong by the way is</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.450" end="01:26:30.690" style="s2">you not know right you know that right</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.220" end="01:26:33.450" style="s2">you know that little solar system model</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.690" end="01:26:35.370" style="s2">of the atom is right mostly wrong kind</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.450" end="01:26:37.590" style="s2">the right and certain circuits entries</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.370" end="01:26:40.410" style="s2">you do all kinds of hand waving below</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.590" end="01:26:41.790" style="s2">okay okay so let&#39;s first of all do it</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.410" end="01:26:44.040" style="s2">linguistically and then formally so</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.790" end="01:26:46.200" style="s2">here&#39;s the idea right this is from</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.040" end="01:26:50.460" style="s2">ganders work that you would get</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.200" end="01:26:52.560" style="s2">something like this on attracts the</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.460" end="01:26:58.340" style="s2">planet I know it goes both ways but let</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.560" end="01:27:00.170" style="s2">me just write this way okay planets</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.340" end="01:27:05.060" style="s2">orbit</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.170" end="01:27:07.160" style="s2">son right and there&#39;s equilibrium that</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.060" end="01:27:10.580" style="s2">stands for equilibrium between the</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.160" end="01:27:23.000" style="s2">fracture day or the day or at least</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.580" end="01:27:31.870" style="s2">long-term pseudo equilibrium okay so the</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.000" end="01:27:31.870" style="s2">idea here is right so there&#39;s the source</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.680" end="01:27:45.520" style="s2">target the nucleus of the atom</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.140" end="01:27:55.940" style="s2">not quite often it is tracked electrons</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.520" end="01:28:08.900" style="s2">alright the electrons orbit and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.940" end="01:28:10.400" style="s2">equilibrium between orbiting sort with</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.900" end="01:28:12.670" style="s2">the first order like an attraction in</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.400" end="01:28:12.670" style="s2">order</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.380" end="01:28:23.370" style="s2">[Applause]</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.900" end="01:28:25.290" style="s2">okay so this is getting mapped over this</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.370" end="01:28:31.370" style="s2">is getting mapped over and then this</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.290" end="01:28:31.370" style="s2">whole thing is getting knocked over okay</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.210" end="01:28:37.410" style="s2">we&#39;re going to formalize this in a</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.200" end="01:28:38.910" style="s2">second to person so the idea is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.410" end="01:28:41.280" style="s2">getting not when I talk about the</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.910" end="01:28:44.100" style="s2">structure what&#39;s getting map is this</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.280" end="01:28:47.940" style="s2">relation this relation and then this</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.100" end="01:28:50.790" style="s2">relation of relations so the structure</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.940" end="01:28:52.230" style="s2">what your right is just intuitively</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.790" end="01:28:55.350" style="s2">we&#39;re going to make it more formal</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.230" end="01:28:59.900" style="s2">distinction for this mic doesn&#39;t get too</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.350" end="01:29:04.080" style="s2">equivocal right what&#39;s going on is right</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.900" end="01:29:06.600" style="s2">I&#39;m leaving the content of the solar</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.080" end="01:29:10.290" style="s2">system behind all I&#39;m picking up on are</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.600" end="01:29:12.660" style="s2">these important this red relation and</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.290" end="01:29:15.140" style="s2">relation of relations is a system of</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.660" end="01:29:18.990" style="s2">relation that is getting mapped over</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.140" end="01:29:20.700" style="s2">okay I&#39;m having this over and then of</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.990" end="01:29:22.890" style="s2">course this talks about orbiting and</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.700" end="01:29:32.270" style="s2">attracting and a mapping for mating and</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.890" end="01:29:36.390" style="s2">attraction over as well so the idea is</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.270" end="01:29:39.390" style="s2">theory again persecuted Li right is that</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.390" end="01:29:41.490" style="s2">you know Bohr has this knows this</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.390" end="01:29:44.100" style="s2">doesn&#39;t know this sounds all sort of all</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.490" end="01:29:45.240" style="s2">the data you know all the empirical data</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.100" end="01:29:47.730" style="s2">he&#39;s trying to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.240" end="01:29:52.560" style="s2">structure it to make sense of the atom</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.730" end="01:29:55.710" style="s2">and then right make this analogy Maps</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.560" end="01:29:58.530" style="s2">this structure over and then right at</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.710" end="01:30:01.280" style="s2">the inside oh the other there&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.530" end="01:30:01.280" style="s2">solar system</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.429" end="01:30:07.789" style="s2">and that would counted as an instance of</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.989" end="01:30:09.800" style="s2">scientific creativity which of course it</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.789" end="01:30:12.039" style="s2">was because he created an important</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.800" end="01:30:12.039" style="s2">theory</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.959" end="01:30:26.829" style="s2">okay so now how we make this a little</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.429" end="01:30:31.570" style="s2">bit more formal so what Hitler does</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.829" end="01:30:33.619" style="s2">right is tactical predicates and</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.570" end="01:30:38.539" style="s2">arguments and then I&#39;m going to suggest</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.619" end="01:30:43.329" style="s2">we change so this is a predicate right</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.539" end="01:30:45.769" style="s2">and then an argument I think is a</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.329" end="01:30:47.269" style="s2">particular object proof that predicates</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.769" end="01:30:48.829" style="s2">could be applied so that&#39;s a way of</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.269" end="01:30:51.800" style="s2">representing that the ball is round</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.829" end="01:30:53.900" style="s2">okay I need calling this an argument is</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.800" end="01:30:55.820" style="s2">it deeply confusing a stupid thing to do</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.900" end="01:31:00.530" style="s2">because it&#39;s not an argument is an</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.820" end="01:31:02.150" style="s2">instantiation don&#39;t want it I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.530" end="01:31:03.949" style="s2">maybe psychologists just just do a</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.150" end="01:31:05.539" style="s2">little bit more logic cleaning I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.949" end="01:31:08.659" style="s2">know what to say about that it&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.539" end="01:31:11.989" style="s2">argument it&#39;s an instantiation it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.659" end="01:31:13.400" style="s2">fast proposition always output a single</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.989" end="01:31:17.209" style="s2">proposition cannot possibly be an</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.400" end="01:31:19.280" style="s2">argument the whole around right okay so</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.209" end="01:31:21.979" style="s2">conscious it&#39;s on good term</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.280" end="01:31:28.479" style="s2">okay so we&#39;ll talk about predicate and</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.979" end="01:31:31.659" style="s2">instantiation okay so all right then</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.479" end="01:31:35.599" style="s2">when you have is that attributes or</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.659" end="01:31:37.219" style="s2">predicate that can like have can take</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.599" end="01:31:45.409" style="s2">one instantiation</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.219" end="01:31:48.380" style="s2">okay so here&#39;s an example large X all</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.409" end="01:31:50.360" style="s2">right so I think what many things in</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.380" end="01:31:55.610" style="s2">there large elegant large ball large</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.360" end="01:32:02.360" style="s2">power large ego including a promo</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.610" end="01:32:06.200" style="s2">and powers and competence okay so write</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.360" end="01:32:08.630" style="s2">back an attribute a relation is a</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.200" end="01:32:19.280" style="s2">predicate can have two or more of those</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.630" end="01:32:21.770" style="s2">there it is so write collide x1 have to</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.280" end="01:32:23.840" style="s2">be two things that get instantiated for</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.770" end="01:32:32.240" style="s2">that predicate can&#39;t just have one big</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.840" end="01:32:34.700" style="s2">colliding okay so very good when you</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.240" end="01:32:37.490" style="s2">attribute some property to something is</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.700" end="01:32:38.840" style="s2">that okay so accepted little bit of</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.490" end="01:32:40.300" style="s2">logic of the rest of the course because</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.840" end="01:32:45.140" style="s2">we what we&#39;re getting into</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.300" end="01:32:50.900" style="s2">okay attribute it can take one instant</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.140" end="01:32:52.250" style="s2">Nation relation can take two next</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.900" end="01:32:54.530" style="s2">distinction we have to make a</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.250" end="01:32:57.680" style="s2">distinction between first order and</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.530" end="01:33:05.800" style="s2">higher order predicate first order and</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.680" end="01:33:10.040" style="s2">higher order predicate first order and</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.800" end="01:33:17.440" style="s2">higher order targets first order</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.040" end="01:33:21.700" style="s2">predicate our predicate right let&#39;s take</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.440" end="01:33:21.700" style="s2">objects as their instances</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.330" end="01:33:30.420" style="s2">okay here&#39;s what we&#39;re sort of prank is</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.930" end="01:33:36.930" style="s2">accredited to take objects and their</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.420" end="01:33:40.170" style="s2">instances higher-order predicate take</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.930" end="01:33:41.760" style="s2">predicates as their instances they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.170" end="01:33:44.250" style="s2">meta predicates in that sense</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.760" end="01:33:48.560" style="s2">higher-order try to get to a predicate</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.250" end="01:33:53.730" style="s2">education right so this is an example</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.560" end="01:33:57.690" style="s2">again also from again this is gamblers</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.730" end="01:33:59.090" style="s2">example not mine I know why emphasizing</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.690" end="01:34:05.220" style="s2">this when I put it on the board</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.090" end="01:34:25.170" style="s2">okay I&#39;m going to comment on why she</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.220" end="01:34:30.390" style="s2">used it maybe she was having a</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.170" end="01:34:37.230" style="s2">particular tactic glide truck car rank</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.390" end="01:34:37.980" style="s2">woman man okay so these are first-order</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.230" end="01:34:41.720" style="s2">bracket</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.980" end="01:34:41.720" style="s2">here&#39;s a higher order predicate</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.300" end="01:35:17.110" style="s2">okay so this is a first-order predicate</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.159" end="01:35:20.900" style="s2">it&#39;s taking objects as its instances yes</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.110" end="01:35:22.729" style="s2">this is a higher order predicate because</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.900" end="01:35:26.599" style="s2">it&#39;s taking two privates as its</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.729" end="01:35:32.179" style="s2">instances okay</p>
<p begin="01:35:26.599" end="01:35:37.010" style="s2">again predicate attributes one instance</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.179" end="01:35:39.110" style="s2">relation to lower order predicate right</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.010" end="01:35:41.239" style="s2">take objects that they&#39;re instances</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.110" end="01:35:45.590" style="s2">higher order predicate are also by</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.239" end="01:35:54.019" style="s2">definition relation right and they take</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.590" end="01:35:56.179" style="s2">predicate and they&#39;re instances yes okay</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.019" end="01:35:59.739" style="s2">so the truck collided with the car which</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.179" end="01:35:59.739" style="s2">caused the woman to strike the man</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.510" end="01:36:05.769" style="s2">that&#39;s for example mama</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.340" end="01:36:15.349" style="s2">I guess they&#39;re maybe she had a really</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.889" end="01:36:18.469" style="s2">bad drive into work the day she wrote</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.349" end="01:36:22.190" style="s2">this okay</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.469" end="01:36:23.869" style="s2">so perfect okay so we have the distinct</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.190" end="01:36:25.159" style="s2">predicate that is interpreting</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.869" end="01:36:26.630" style="s2">attributes in relations and the</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.159" end="01:36:28.190" style="s2">distinction distinction between</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.630" end="01:36:29.840" style="s2">lower-limb predicates and hire or</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.190" end="01:36:31.519" style="s2">etiquette and higher-order predicates</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.840" end="01:36:34.550" style="s2">are always relations because they take</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.519" end="01:36:40.070" style="s2">at least two because okay let&#39;s get</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.550" end="01:36:44.599" style="s2">going okay so now that what you can see</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.070" end="01:36:46.969" style="s2">is I can turn all of this into a formal</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.599" end="01:36:49.130" style="s2">representation and then you&#39;ll see what</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.969" end="01:37:05.869" style="s2">the structure is given that tell me</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.130" end="01:37:09.070" style="s2">representation so this start that stands</p>
<p begin="01:37:05.869" end="01:37:09.070" style="s2">for equilibrium okay</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.430" end="01:37:42.620" style="s2">so if I go here right Xfinity on and</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.460" end="01:37:45.020" style="s2">watch them for planets but we go here X</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.620" end="01:37:49.850" style="s2">stands for a nucleus and wife and two</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.020" end="01:37:52.730" style="s2">are electrons but I can use this same</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.850" end="01:38:01.520" style="s2">now here&#39;s the again the same structure</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.730" end="01:38:04.460" style="s2">exists in both okay so what I have is I</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.520" end="01:38:07.100" style="s2">have a higher order predicate right that</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.460" end="01:38:11.690" style="s2">is a relation between two lower order</p>
<p begin="01:38:07.100" end="01:38:14.390" style="s2">predicates that are relations what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:11.690" end="01:38:17.390" style="s2">common between the source and the target</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.390" end="01:38:20.270" style="s2">is that structure and what we do in an</p>
<p begin="01:38:17.390" end="01:38:24.550" style="s2">analogy is you find the structure in one</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.270" end="01:38:24.550" style="s2">thing and you map it on to the target</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.830" end="01:38:40.340" style="s2">right so far and one person is</p>
<p begin="01:38:38.330" end="01:38:41.600" style="s2">responding like I&#39;m I can&#39;t go forward</p>
<p begin="01:38:40.340" end="01:38:43.520" style="s2">in this argument on this this makes</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.600" end="01:38:47.300" style="s2">sense to you because it was all okay and</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.520" end="01:38:49.220" style="s2">nothing will matter okay yes like I get</p>
<p begin="01:38:47.300" end="01:38:51.740" style="s2">the general argument so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.220" end="01:38:59.090" style="s2">understand these I think I do or go back</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.740" end="01:39:05.240" style="s2">for a bit okay so sine attracts the</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.090" end="01:39:06.590" style="s2">plants yep the planets orbit the Sun and</p>
<p begin="01:39:05.240" end="01:39:08.960" style="s2">there is equilibrium between the</p>
<p begin="01:39:06.590" end="01:39:11.360" style="s2">attraction and E for more video clinics</p>
<p begin="01:39:08.960" end="01:39:14.300" style="s2">but I can go over here right the nucleus</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.360" end="01:39:17.330" style="s2">attracts the electrons okay the</p>
<p begin="01:39:14.300" end="01:39:18.800" style="s2">electrons orbit the nucleus and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:39:17.330" end="01:39:20.330" style="s2">equilibrium between the attraction in</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.800" end="01:39:22.100" style="s2">the orbit focus on them in the structure</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.330" end="01:39:23.810" style="s2">could be untouchable that&#39;s right the</p>
<p begin="01:39:22.100" end="01:39:26.930" style="s2">structure is exactly the same okay well</p>
<p begin="01:39:23.810" end="01:39:28.700" style="s2">I understood that times to know</p>
<p begin="01:39:26.930" end="01:39:31.760" style="s2">didn&#39;t understand how interpret the form</p>
<p begin="01:39:28.700" end="01:39:35.180" style="s2">of the actual para I just taught it to</p>
<p begin="01:39:31.760" end="01:39:36.500" style="s2">you yeah okay so alright so what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:39:35.180" end="01:39:39.700" style="s2">getting is you&#39;re getting what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:39:36.500" end="01:39:44.030" style="s2">happening an analogy is you&#39;re mapping</p>
<p begin="01:39:39.700" end="01:39:51.500" style="s2">okay yeah I don&#39;t need to keep this up</p>
<p begin="01:39:44.030" end="01:39:54.080" style="s2">anymore do it yes what because here it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:39:51.500" end="01:40:03.170" style="s2">Nicolas attract electrons here electrons</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.080" end="01:40:05.480" style="s2">in orbit the nucleus just be yours</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.170" end="01:40:06.950" style="s2">that&#39;s all English syntax work it was</p>
<p begin="01:40:05.480" end="01:40:08.510" style="s2">German we wouldn&#39;t care about the order</p>
<p begin="01:40:06.950" end="01:40:12.170" style="s2">we have inflections at the end but we</p>
<p begin="01:40:08.510" end="01:40:15.080" style="s2">don&#39;t want to do German inflected</p>
<p begin="01:40:12.170" end="01:40:17.180" style="s2">languages are really hard to as any does</p>
<p begin="01:40:15.080" end="01:40:19.400" style="s2">anybody know a language that&#39;s lonely</p>
<p begin="01:40:17.180" end="01:40:20.900" style="s2">and English in this class it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:40:19.400" end="01:40:23.480" style="s2">inflected language like German or</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.900" end="01:40:24.830" style="s2">something like that I just want to know</p>
<p begin="01:40:23.480" end="01:40:28.030" style="s2">what it&#39;s like to try and translate an</p>
<p begin="01:40:24.830" end="01:40:30.290" style="s2">inflected language into symbolic logic</p>
<p begin="01:40:28.030" end="01:40:32.480" style="s2">because inflected languages don&#39;t rely</p>
<p begin="01:40:30.290" end="01:40:41.000" style="s2">on word order to specify logical</p>
<p begin="01:40:32.480" end="01:40:43.390" style="s2">relations party okay so what is that you</p>
<p begin="01:40:41.000" end="01:40:54.350" style="s2">learn symbolic logic</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.390" end="01:40:57.230" style="s2">I know it&#39;s logic but never the twain</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.350" end="01:40:59.360" style="s2">your back no I&#39;m just thinking even when</p>
<p begin="01:40:57.230" end="01:41:03.350" style="s2">you&#39;re translating English into like</p>
<p begin="01:40:59.360" end="01:41:05.270" style="s2">lism before well what part English is</p>
<p begin="01:41:03.350" end="01:41:06.920" style="s2">weird</p>
<p begin="01:41:05.270" end="01:41:10.070" style="s2">I&#39;m just saying the order usually</p>
<p begin="01:41:06.920" end="01:41:11.600" style="s2">doesn&#39;t say the same anyway like</p>
<p begin="01:41:10.070" end="01:41:13.130" style="s2">sometimes if you want express a</p>

<p begin="01:41:13.130" end="01:41:19.140" style="s2">yeah you order and the problem</p>

<p begin="01:42:06.120" end="01:42:10.830" style="s2">because the translation problem is the</p>

<p begin="01:42:13.590" end="01:42:16.290" style="s2">test you on they teach you all this</p>

<p begin="01:42:22.320" end="01:42:32.430" style="s2">because what I would like that an X or Y</p>

<p begin="01:42:43.500" end="01:42:57.240" style="s2">should have measured this better I will</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.880" end="01:43:00.690" style="s2">never fit okay so now here&#39;s how can we</p>
<p begin="01:42:57.240" end="01:43:02.490" style="s2">use is this or maybe lb lb wonder</p>

<p begin="02:04:39.950" end="02:04:44.780" style="s2">reason is that many theories of</p>

<p begin="02:04:58.100" end="02:05:03.470" style="s2">suggest to you is that this is the best</p>
<p begin="02:04:59.840" end="02:05:06.800" style="s2">version of that theory to have and it</p>
<p begin="02:05:03.470" end="02:05:08.480" style="s2">doesn&#39;t do the job for logical reasons I</p>
<p begin="02:05:06.800" end="02:05:10.430" style="s2">didn&#39;t have to present any miracle</p>
<p begin="02:05:08.480" end="02:05:13.820" style="s2">evidence to you just for logical reasons</p>
<p begin="02:05:10.430" end="02:05:17.230" style="s2">it cannot do the job of distinguishing</p>
<p begin="02:05:13.820" end="02:05:19.730" style="s2">creativity from inside just can&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="02:05:17.230" end="02:05:21.520" style="s2">just not set up doing just not set up</p>

<p begin="02:05:25.580" end="02:05:37.450" style="s2">let&#39;s look it up okay</p>
<p begin="02:05:43.170" end="02:05:51.820" style="s2">what else might be at work I think one</p>
<p begin="02:05:48.070" end="02:05:54.300" style="s2">area that is probably the second most</p>
<p begin="02:05:51.820" end="02:05:57.400" style="s2">prominent and it was pretty much like</p>
<p begin="02:05:54.300" end="02:05:59.860" style="s2">came up quite rapidly in the discussion</p>
<p begin="02:05:57.400" end="02:06:02.680" style="s2">with you is to look for motivational</p>
<p begin="02:05:59.860" end="02:06:04.060" style="s2">differences between creativity inside</p>
<p begin="02:06:02.680" end="02:06:05.740" style="s2">many of you were trying to do that in</p>
<p begin="02:06:04.060" end="02:06:06.430" style="s2">terms of well I&#39;m not more into but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:06:05.740" end="02:06:08.740" style="s2">goal-oriented</p>
<p begin="02:06:06.430" end="02:06:10.840" style="s2">or I care about it is this is back</p>
<p begin="02:06:08.740" end="02:06:11.950" style="s2">rather than this is for granted and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:06:10.840" end="02:06:13.650" style="s2">not saying that there are differences of</p>
<p begin="02:06:11.950" end="02:06:16.750" style="s2">but I&#39;m trying to lump them together</p>
<p begin="02:06:13.650" end="02:06:20.260" style="s2">because that is another main sort of</p>
<p begin="02:06:16.750" end="02:06:22.120" style="s2">step families a family of theories we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:06:20.260" end="02:06:23.560" style="s2">trying to talk about creativity that</p>
<p begin="02:06:22.120" end="02:06:26.230" style="s2">what distinguishes creativity from</p>
<p begin="02:06:23.560" end="02:06:31.630" style="s2">insight in some very significant and</p>
<p begin="02:06:26.230" end="02:06:34.540" style="s2">relevant motivational differences so</p>
<p begin="02:06:31.630" end="02:06:40.140" style="s2">this also has a long-established</p>
<p begin="02:06:34.540" end="02:06:40.140" style="s2">or a research tradition attached to it</p>
<p begin="02:06:49.150" end="02:07:01.160" style="s2">okay so there&#39;s a conference on</p>
<p begin="02:06:57.920" end="02:07:07.989" style="s2">creativity held I&#39;m just looking for my</p>
<p begin="02:07:01.160" end="02:07:12.440" style="s2">notes to head up Operation Blessing 1962</p>
<p begin="02:07:07.989" end="02:07:13.910" style="s2">it was held in Colorado where a lot of</p>
<p begin="02:07:12.440" end="02:07:21.830" style="s2">these kinds of conferences seem to be</p>
<p begin="02:07:13.910" end="02:07:28.310" style="s2">held on creativity and there was an idea</p>
<p begin="02:07:21.830" end="02:07:29.870" style="s2">from a bigger name ten lay the original</p>
<p begin="02:07:28.310" end="02:07:33.380" style="s2">proposal with the idea of attached</p>
<p begin="02:07:29.870" end="02:07:35.860" style="s2">devotion which sounds like the beginning</p>
<p begin="02:07:33.380" end="02:07:38.330" style="s2">of the ending of your relationship</p>
<p begin="02:07:35.860" end="02:07:40.730" style="s2">attached devotion there is the correct</p>
<p begin="02:07:38.330" end="02:07:42.890" style="s2">sort of attitude and motivational</p>
<p begin="02:07:40.730" end="02:07:45.260" style="s2">relation that people have when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:07:42.890" end="02:07:46.610" style="s2">creative they&#39;re detached from what</p>
<p begin="02:07:45.260" end="02:07:48.850" style="s2">they&#39;re doing but they&#39;re also devoted</p>
<p begin="02:07:46.610" end="02:07:48.850" style="s2">to it</p>
<p begin="02:07:51.369" end="02:07:58.540" style="s2">so the idea right is you have intense</p>
<p begin="02:07:55.869" end="02:08:01.889" style="s2">passion and commitment that is balanced</p>
<p begin="02:07:58.540" end="02:08:04.690" style="s2">by capacity for critical detachment and</p>
<p begin="02:08:01.889" end="02:08:06.969" style="s2">that makes you more capable with</p>
<p begin="02:08:04.690" end="02:08:09.670" style="s2">insightful problem-solving or generating</p>
<p begin="02:08:06.969" end="02:08:15.940" style="s2">for finding instances that people find</p>
<p begin="02:08:09.670" end="02:08:27.310" style="s2">insightful conception so Rushfield took</p>
<p begin="02:08:15.940" end="02:08:30.940" style="s2">that idea also right in 1962 and made a</p>
<p begin="02:08:27.310" end="02:08:33.550" style="s2">distinction between ego involved or</p>
<p begin="02:08:30.940" end="02:08:36.070" style="s2">extrinsic motivation even if you played</p>
<p begin="02:08:33.550" end="02:08:37.570" style="s2">it like you printed a motivational term</p>
<p begin="02:08:36.070" end="02:08:39.520" style="s2">see the person that sort of took this</p>
<p begin="02:08:37.570" end="02:08:41.500" style="s2">vague idea from Han Leia in the</p>
<p begin="02:08:39.520" end="02:08:44.650" style="s2">conference and he framed it in</p>
<p begin="02:08:41.500" end="02:08:47.440" style="s2">motivational terms so Eagle involved or</p>
<p begin="02:08:44.650" end="02:08:51.909" style="s2">extrinsic motivation that&#39;s two words</p>
<p begin="02:08:47.440" end="02:08:54.790" style="s2">for the same thing versus versus right</p>
<p begin="02:08:51.909" end="02:08:59.170" style="s2">intrinsic motivation or tasks involve</p>
<p begin="02:08:54.790" end="02:09:09.630" style="s2">motivation so on one side is ego</p>
<p begin="02:08:59.170" end="02:09:09.630" style="s2">involved that&#39;s physics I basketball</p>
<p begin="02:09:15.360" end="02:09:24.560" style="s2">in service and the main idea was that</p>
<p begin="02:09:21.690" end="02:09:29.070" style="s2">what what happens in creativity is</p>
<p begin="02:09:24.560" end="02:09:31.920" style="s2">people are able to become right</p>
<p begin="02:09:29.070" end="02:09:34.650" style="s2">intrinsically motivated and they are</p>
<p begin="02:09:31.920" end="02:09:36.540" style="s2">task oriented rather than goal oriented</p>
<p begin="02:09:34.650" end="02:09:39.720" style="s2">in ego involved and some of you</p>
<p begin="02:09:36.540" end="02:09:41.610" style="s2">articulate is out which is why I was</p>
<p begin="02:09:39.720" end="02:09:47.010" style="s2">sort of like not trying to debate you</p>
<p begin="02:09:41.610" end="02:09:50.190" style="s2">too much because this idea is as almost</p>
<p begin="02:09:47.010" end="02:09:51.930" style="s2">as all to be and when you&#39;re older than</p>
<p begin="02:09:50.190" end="02:09:58.410" style="s2">so this idea has been around for a long</p>
<p begin="02:09:51.930" end="02:10:01.080" style="s2">time in psychology now there&#39;s quite a</p>
<p begin="02:09:58.410" end="02:10:05.000" style="s2">bit of work going on about this</p>
<p begin="02:10:01.080" end="02:10:08.810" style="s2">and the problem is this became sort of a</p>
<p begin="02:10:05.000" end="02:10:11.460" style="s2">problematic way of talking about it</p>
<p begin="02:10:08.810" end="02:10:16.410" style="s2">because we are not really clear on what</p>
<p begin="02:10:11.460" end="02:10:18.750" style="s2">that term means okay and so a good rule</p>
<p begin="02:10:16.410" end="02:10:21.030" style="s2">of thumb is don&#39;t use a more model and</p>
<p begin="02:10:18.750" end="02:10:23.060" style="s2">controversial thing to try and define</p>
<p begin="02:10:21.030" end="02:10:25.350" style="s2">your models in a controversial thing I</p>
<p begin="02:10:23.060" end="02:10:26.700" style="s2">put it define creativity with it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:10:25.350" end="02:10:30.150" style="s2">equally muddled and controversial</p>
<p begin="02:10:26.700" end="02:10:34.080" style="s2">construct the ego and so what happened</p>
<p begin="02:10:30.150" end="02:10:36.660" style="s2">is if the emphasis became on extrinsic</p>
<p begin="02:10:34.080" end="02:10:38.520" style="s2">versus intrinsic motivation and then</p>
<p begin="02:10:36.660" end="02:10:41.580" style="s2">that was defined in terms of whether or</p>
<p begin="02:10:38.520" end="02:10:45.540" style="s2">not you are sort of goal oriented or</p>
<p begin="02:10:41.580" end="02:10:49.160" style="s2">categories which is again to be fair the</p>
<p begin="02:10:45.540" end="02:10:52.620" style="s2">language many of you will use it today</p>
<p begin="02:10:49.160" end="02:10:55.190" style="s2">okay so this was taken up by Teresa</p>
<p begin="02:10:52.620" end="02:10:55.190" style="s2">amiable</p>
<p begin="02:10:57.500" end="02:11:03.570" style="s2">so you sort of had a lot of discussion</p>
<p begin="02:10:59.909" end="02:11:05.909" style="s2">through this sixties in the 70s and then</p>
<p begin="02:11:03.570" end="02:11:09.000" style="s2">like I said it&#39;s sort of gelled in her</p>
<p begin="02:11:05.909" end="02:11:10.710" style="s2">work if she had what she developed what</p>
<p begin="02:11:09.000" end="02:11:13.320" style="s2">she called the intrinsic motivation</p>
<p begin="02:11:10.710" end="02:11:16.050" style="s2">hypothesis the intrinsic motivation</p>
<p begin="02:11:13.320" end="02:11:19.290" style="s2">hypothesis so she put it into a testable</p>
<p begin="02:11:16.050" end="02:11:22.170" style="s2">form hypothesis etc intrinsic motivation</p>
<p begin="02:11:19.290" end="02:11:23.790" style="s2">hypothesis okay I&#39;ll read you out the</p>
<p begin="02:11:22.170" end="02:11:26.389" style="s2">hypothesis and then we&#39;ll define some of</p>
<p begin="02:11:23.790" end="02:11:29.400" style="s2">the core terms within it okay</p>
<p begin="02:11:26.389" end="02:11:33.840" style="s2">the intrinsically motivated state is</p>
<p begin="02:11:29.400" end="02:11:35.699" style="s2">conducive to creativity whereas the</p>
<p begin="02:11:33.840" end="02:11:39.030" style="s2">extensively motivated state is</p>
<p begin="02:11:35.699" end="02:11:43.260" style="s2">detrimental now it&#39;s interesting because</p>
<p begin="02:11:39.030" end="02:11:45.060" style="s2">this is kind of eerie parallels with you</p>
<p begin="02:11:43.260" end="02:11:47.040" style="s2">know propositional processing versus</p>
<p begin="02:11:45.060" end="02:11:49.320" style="s2">procedural processing it&#39;s not the same</p>
<p begin="02:11:47.040" end="02:11:51.540" style="s2">at all but it deals like the same time</p>
<p begin="02:11:49.320" end="02:11:54.060" style="s2">it&#39;s structurally analogous right now</p>
<p begin="02:11:51.540" end="02:11:55.949" style="s2">the intrinsically motivated state is</p>
<p begin="02:11:54.060" end="02:11:57.600" style="s2">conducive to creativity whereas the</p>
<p begin="02:11:55.949" end="02:11:59.369" style="s2">extrinsically motivated state is</p>
<p begin="02:11:57.600" end="02:12:01.980" style="s2">detrimental so what&#39;s the intrinsic</p>
<p begin="02:11:59.369" end="02:12:03.920" style="s2">motivation intrinsic motivation is the</p>
<p begin="02:12:01.980" end="02:12:09.960" style="s2">motivation to engage in an activity</p>
<p begin="02:12:03.920" end="02:12:11.820" style="s2">primarily for its own sake so sorry to</p>
<p begin="02:12:09.960" end="02:12:16.170" style="s2">be graphic but the prototypical example</p>
<p begin="02:12:11.820" end="02:12:19.860" style="s2">that&#39;s usually given it sucks and</p>
<p begin="02:12:16.170" end="02:12:22.290" style="s2">sometimes like you engage in sex</p>
<p begin="02:12:19.860" end="02:12:24.989" style="s2">extrinsically because you try to have a</p>
<p begin="02:12:22.290" end="02:12:28.739" style="s2">kid man talk about one thing that will</p>
<p begin="02:12:24.989" end="02:12:30.929" style="s2">really kill your suchlike is that so</p>
<p begin="02:12:28.739" end="02:12:34.230" style="s2">then you extrinsically our focus it</p>
<p begin="02:12:30.929" end="02:12:37.860" style="s2">really removes a lot of the creativity</p>
<p begin="02:12:34.230" end="02:12:42.719" style="s2">from the endeavor I&#39;m trying to speak as</p>
<p begin="02:12:37.860" end="02:12:44.730" style="s2">neutrally as I can so the motivation to</p>
<p begin="02:12:42.719" end="02:12:48.210" style="s2">engage in activity primarily for its own</p>
<p begin="02:12:44.730" end="02:12:50.960" style="s2">sake because the individual precedes the</p>
<p begin="02:12:48.210" end="02:12:54.600" style="s2">activity is interesting involving</p>
<p begin="02:12:50.960" end="02:12:56.820" style="s2">satisfying or personally challenging it</p>
<p begin="02:12:54.600" end="02:13:00.380" style="s2">is marked by focus on the challenge and</p>
<p begin="02:12:56.820" end="02:13:00.380" style="s2">enjoyment of the work itself</p>
<p begin="02:13:01.380" end="02:13:09.390" style="s2">okay that&#39;s it yes but don&#39;t be both</p>

<p begin="02:14:25.590" end="02:14:30.900" style="s2">motivated you are the less created one</p>
<p begin="02:14:29.700" end="02:14:33.020" style="s2">thing you could have like a balanced</p>
<p begin="02:14:30.900" end="02:14:36.090" style="s2">issue and then it&#39;s not simply happen</p>
<p begin="02:14:33.020" end="02:14:38.250" style="s2">kind of it&#39;s not that easy but yeah so</p>

<p begin="02:15:12.489" end="02:15:17.139" style="s2">right you work well under certain levels</p>
<p begin="02:15:15.820" end="02:15:20.829" style="s2">of arousal that have been properly</p>
<p begin="02:15:17.139" end="02:15:22.630" style="s2">framed about you but the cramming</p>
<p begin="02:15:20.829" end="02:15:24.489" style="s2">technology likes to turn that into the</p>
<p begin="02:15:22.630" end="02:15:31.479" style="s2">simplistic constructive credit of</p>

<p begin="02:15:31.479" end="02:15:39.639" style="s2">being sort of like because it&#39;s just not</p>
<p begin="02:15:34.869" end="02:15:41.050" style="s2">the case that like cramming is effective</p>

<p begin="02:15:42.639" end="02:15:58.689" style="s2">honor works for me so continuous study</p>
<p begin="02:15:54.570" end="02:16:00.849" style="s2">is way better than cramming sorry just</p>
<p begin="02:15:58.689" end="02:16:03.159" style="s2">every single time we put them into</p>
<p begin="02:16:00.849" end="02:16:06.760" style="s2">competition continuously so start study</p>

<p begin="02:17:04.960" end="02:17:09.969" style="s2">anxiety and so typically you will</p>
<p begin="02:17:08.229" end="02:17:15.670" style="s2">mediate anxiety by moving to more</p>

<p begin="02:17:56.050" end="02:17:59.789" style="s2">intrinsic motivation to reduce anxiety</p>
<p begin="02:17:57.670" end="02:18:01.689" style="s2">you just want to do it for its own sake</p>
<p begin="02:17:59.789" end="02:18:05.590" style="s2">they&#39;re overwhelmed the extrinsic</p>
<p begin="02:18:01.689" end="02:18:07.539" style="s2">motivations are worse so here you avoid</p>
<p begin="02:18:05.590" end="02:18:12.219" style="s2">behavior and the new planning as a way</p>
<p begin="02:18:07.539" end="02:18:13.719" style="s2">of trying to address the anxiety sorry</p>
<p begin="02:18:12.219" end="02:18:15.429" style="s2">that was just an opportunity for me to</p>
<p begin="02:18:13.719" end="02:18:17.260" style="s2">again say why you should do continuous</p>
<p begin="02:18:15.429" end="02:18:18.819" style="s2">study rather than coming and the</p>
<p begin="02:18:17.260" end="02:18:35.380" style="s2">research shows that you will all now</p>
<p begin="02:18:18.819" end="02:18:36.969" style="s2">ignore me though there is aspects of the</p>
<p begin="02:18:35.380" end="02:18:39.819" style="s2">inside ever that are in the queue top</p>
<p begin="02:18:36.969" end="02:18:42.219" style="s2">okay okay so obviously as you can gather</p>
<p begin="02:18:39.819" end="02:18:43.840" style="s2">from what an extrinsic motivation like</p>
<p begin="02:18:42.219" end="02:18:45.719" style="s2">the motivation to infuse an activity</p>
<p begin="02:18:43.840" end="02:18:48.099" style="s2">primarily order to beat some bull</p>
<p begin="02:18:45.719" end="02:18:50.409" style="s2">external to the work itself such as a</p>
<p begin="02:18:48.099" end="02:18:52.149" style="s2">seeming expected reward winning a</p>
<p begin="02:18:50.409" end="02:18:54.689" style="s2">competition of eating some requirement</p>
<p begin="02:18:52.149" end="02:18:57.309" style="s2">is marked by focus on external reward</p>
<p begin="02:18:54.689" end="02:19:02.380" style="s2">external recognition and external</p>
<p begin="02:18:57.309" end="02:19:05.229" style="s2">direction of one&#39;s work okay so and what</p>
<p begin="02:19:02.380" end="02:19:07.779" style="s2">happened in the 80s is that MBA was able</p>
<p begin="02:19:05.229" end="02:19:11.229" style="s2">to get quite a lot of experimental</p>
<p begin="02:19:07.779" end="02:19:13.869" style="s2">evidence to right support the intrinsic</p>
<p begin="02:19:11.229" end="02:19:16.300" style="s2">motivation hypothesis when people are</p>
<p begin="02:19:13.869" end="02:19:19.539" style="s2">physically motivated they do seem to be</p>
<p begin="02:19:16.300" end="02:19:21.519" style="s2">more creative and whether it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="02:19:19.539" end="02:19:27.359" style="s2">signal related to creativity that seems</p>
<p begin="02:19:21.519" end="02:19:27.359" style="s2">to go down now what happened is</p>
<p begin="02:19:27.979" end="02:19:36.899" style="s2">there was some challenges to this yeah</p>
<p begin="02:19:34.340" end="02:19:39.809" style="s2">and then there was also two things were</p>
<p begin="02:19:36.899" end="02:19:42.059" style="s2">happening to touch each others as well</p>
<p begin="02:19:39.809" end="02:19:45.059" style="s2">one was the question about whether or</p>
<p begin="02:19:42.059" end="02:19:47.880" style="s2">not this was a clear contra and the</p>
<p begin="02:19:45.059" end="02:19:50.850" style="s2">other question was an explanation as to</p>
<p begin="02:19:47.880" end="02:19:52.860" style="s2">why should work why should it be that</p>
<p begin="02:19:50.850" end="02:19:53.430" style="s2">intrinsic motivation improve your</p>
<p begin="02:19:52.860" end="02:19:56.939" style="s2">creativity</p>
<p begin="02:19:53.430" end="02:19:59.310" style="s2">whereas extrinsic right in and of itself</p>
<p begin="02:19:56.939" end="02:20:01.439" style="s2">is a very expired for it like people</p>
<p begin="02:19:59.310" end="02:20:04.380" style="s2">sort of not know yes but that not</p>
<p begin="02:20:01.439" end="02:20:06.390" style="s2">usually indicates familiarity with what</p>
<p begin="02:20:04.380" end="02:20:09.390" style="s2">we talked about rather than being able</p>
<p begin="02:20:06.390" end="02:20:11.880" style="s2">to provide an explanation as to why the</p>
<p begin="02:20:09.390" end="02:20:14.130" style="s2">intrinsic motivation words right</p>
<p begin="02:20:11.880" end="02:20:24.149" style="s2">facility creativity and extrinsic would</p>
<p begin="02:20:14.130" end="02:20:26.700" style="s2">be detrimental okay so in answer to the</p>
<p begin="02:20:24.149" end="02:20:29.370" style="s2">first problem people have started to</p>
<p begin="02:20:26.700" end="02:20:32.220" style="s2">point out that it wasn&#39;t clear there</p>
<p begin="02:20:29.370" end="02:20:34.080" style="s2">were certain things that not done the</p>
<p begin="02:20:32.220" end="02:20:35.850" style="s2">next thing I was doing develop but there</p>
<p begin="02:20:34.080" end="02:20:37.430" style="s2">were certain things that it wasn&#39;t clear</p>
<p begin="02:20:35.850" end="02:20:42.780" style="s2">if they were intrinsic or extrinsic</p>
<p begin="02:20:37.430" end="02:20:44.910" style="s2">motivation so while that one of them was</p>
<p begin="02:20:42.780" end="02:20:47.010" style="s2">mild one that Hannibal used in her</p>
<p begin="02:20:44.910" end="02:20:50.220" style="s2">definition of extrinsic which is</p>
<p begin="02:20:47.010" end="02:20:53.580" style="s2">achievement is cheap achievement</p>
<p begin="02:20:50.220" end="02:20:56.460" style="s2">intrinsic or extrinsic like because is</p>
<p begin="02:20:53.580" end="02:20:58.050" style="s2">it something that is pursue right like</p>
<p begin="02:20:56.460" end="02:20:59.880" style="s2">when you&#39;re sort of achieving something</p>
<p begin="02:20:58.050" end="02:21:01.920" style="s2">and that&#39;s something in this that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:20:59.880" end="02:21:03.210" style="s2">intrinsic to the task you&#39;re looking to</p>
<p begin="02:21:01.920" end="02:21:05.460" style="s2">achieve in what you&#39;re doing them yeah</p>
<p begin="02:21:03.210" end="02:21:07.680" style="s2">but it also can mean extras of what</p>
<p begin="02:21:05.460" end="02:21:10.320" style="s2">you&#39;ve achieved some status to the</p>
<p begin="02:21:07.680" end="02:21:14.729" style="s2">notion of achievement right was sort of</p>
<p begin="02:21:10.320" end="02:21:17.760" style="s2">very vague now in order to try and get</p>
<p begin="02:21:14.729" end="02:21:21.810" style="s2">clearer about that the second issue was</p>
<p begin="02:21:17.760" end="02:21:23.010" style="s2">addressed and the mechanism the most</p>
<p begin="02:21:21.810" end="02:21:25.620" style="s2">likely or most plausible mechanism</p>
<p begin="02:21:23.010" end="02:21:28.020" style="s2">proposed by an appeal as to why the</p>
<p begin="02:21:25.620" end="02:21:29.939" style="s2">intrinsic motivation were selected so</p>
<p begin="02:21:28.020" end="02:21:32.580" style="s2">much about how intrinsic motivation</p>
<p begin="02:21:29.939" end="02:21:34.391" style="s2">facilitates creativity it was about why</p>
<p begin="02:21:32.580" end="02:21:36.660" style="s2">extrinsic motivation was deaf</p>
<p begin="02:21:34.391" end="02:21:40.891" style="s2">to it and this was the idea that</p>
<p begin="02:21:36.660" end="02:21:40.891" style="s2">extrinsic motivation divided attention</p>
<p begin="02:21:44.670" end="02:21:47.880" style="s2">divided attention</p>
<p begin="02:21:48.301" end="02:21:53.261" style="s2">so you&#39;re just spending less time</p>
<p begin="02:21:50.801" end="02:21:55.120" style="s2">attending to the task that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:21:53.261" end="02:21:58.681" style="s2">spending more time attending to the</p>
<p begin="02:21:55.120" end="02:21:58.681" style="s2">external goal state that you want to get</p>
<p begin="02:21:59.221" end="02:22:04.721" style="s2">we could okay now that that &#39;mobile and</p>
<p begin="02:22:02.320" end="02:22:08.771" style="s2">I deal is now done for a moment speaking</p>
<p begin="02:22:04.721" end="02:22:11.440" style="s2">their baby is going to see on rock and</p>
<p begin="02:22:08.771" end="02:22:13.540" style="s2">not I&#39;m not trying to put words into his</p>
<p begin="02:22:11.440" end="02:22:19.120" style="s2">mouth but I&#39;d say we&#39;re stuck we could</p>
<p begin="02:22:13.540" end="02:22:22.931" style="s2">potentially do strengthen it the more</p>
<p begin="02:22:19.120" end="02:22:24.641" style="s2">you are focused on the task the left</p>
<p begin="02:22:22.931" end="02:22:26.051" style="s2">Luxor the more you focus on the external</p>
<p begin="02:22:24.641" end="02:22:28.240" style="s2">books the more you&#39;re focused on the</p>
<p begin="02:22:26.051" end="02:22:30.130" style="s2">internal goal the last chance you will</p>
<p begin="02:22:28.240" end="02:22:33.450" style="s2">step back and look at the problem</p>
<p begin="02:22:30.130" end="02:22:33.450" style="s2">formulation of your task</p>
<p begin="02:22:39.949" end="02:22:51.960" style="s2">right the less chance you&#39;ll have for</p>
<p begin="02:22:42.600" end="02:22:53.609" style="s2">transparency to opacity shift this is</p>
<p begin="02:22:51.960" end="02:22:57.270" style="s2">not a deal this is using stuff we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:22:53.609" end="02:22:59.460" style="s2">developed in this course the last chance</p>
<p begin="02:22:57.270" end="02:23:01.800" style="s2">you have of looking at your problem</p>
<p begin="02:22:59.460" end="02:23:02.880" style="s2">formulation a task means the greater the</p>
<p begin="02:23:01.800" end="02:23:07.260" style="s2">champion is going to operate</p>
<p begin="02:23:02.880" end="02:23:12.689" style="s2">automatically and automaticity could</p>
<p begin="02:23:07.260" end="02:23:15.239" style="s2">significantly reduce by creativity would</p>
<p begin="02:23:12.689" end="02:23:20.609" style="s2">significantly reduce the capacity for</p>
<p begin="02:23:15.239" end="02:23:22.529" style="s2">insight and innovation so if I increase</p>
<p begin="02:23:20.609" end="02:23:24.479" style="s2">automaticity and reduce the</p>
<p begin="02:23:22.529" end="02:23:27.739" style="s2">possibilities for insight that could</p>
<p begin="02:23:24.479" end="02:23:30.569" style="s2">plausibly be why creative is reduced</p>
<p begin="02:23:27.739" end="02:23:33.960" style="s2">again I will then say any of this I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:23:30.569" end="02:23:36.510" style="s2">trying to make a case stronger River all</p>
<p begin="02:23:33.960" end="02:23:39.449" style="s2">she said was to provide attention now in</p>
<p begin="02:23:36.510" end="02:23:40.890" style="s2">another sense I mean that&#39;s also part of</p>
<p begin="02:23:39.449" end="02:23:42.659" style="s2">it because we did we know that simply</p>
<p begin="02:23:40.890" end="02:23:46.590" style="s2">dividing attention and to reduce</p>
<p begin="02:23:42.659" end="02:23:49.229" style="s2">performance but that would be sort of a</p>
<p begin="02:23:46.590" end="02:23:51.689" style="s2">general thing why might one specifically</p>
<p begin="02:23:49.229" end="02:24:00.300" style="s2">reduce the creative aspect of your</p>
<p begin="02:23:51.689" end="02:24:01.560" style="s2">performance yes well that&#39;s that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="02:24:00.300" end="02:24:02.819" style="s2">the general idea that&#39;s what I meant</p>
<p begin="02:24:01.560" end="02:24:04.439" style="s2">about the general thing about dividing</p>
<p begin="02:24:02.819" end="02:24:07.319" style="s2">attention so dividing attention</p>
<p begin="02:24:04.439" end="02:24:10.260" style="s2">generally reduces the cause it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:24:07.319" end="02:24:12.060" style="s2">cognitive load phenomena and I yes I</p>
<p begin="02:24:10.260" end="02:24:13.140" style="s2">admit that&#39;s part of it but we would</p>
<p begin="02:24:12.060" end="02:24:15.510" style="s2">want to try and make it a little</p>
<p begin="02:24:13.140" end="02:24:17.550" style="s2">explanation more specific and so that we</p>
<p begin="02:24:15.510" end="02:24:20.130" style="s2">could specifically explain what</p>
<p begin="02:24:17.550" end="02:24:21.779" style="s2">creativity is being reduced and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:24:20.130" end="02:24:23.520" style="s2">why I was bringing in this more specific</p>
<p begin="02:24:21.779" end="02:24:26.090" style="s2">machinery of increased automaticity</p>
<p begin="02:24:23.520" end="02:24:33.479" style="s2">right decreased cognitive flexibility</p>
<p begin="02:24:26.090" end="02:24:36.500" style="s2">okay okay so we could black dress what</p>
<p begin="02:24:33.479" end="02:24:36.500" style="s2">she&#39;s saying that way</p>
<p begin="02:24:39.250" end="02:24:47.180" style="s2">ah so some people picked up on that</p>
<p begin="02:24:42.979" end="02:24:49.430" style="s2">Sternberg and Newbridge yes the same</p>
<p begin="02:24:47.180" end="02:24:51.020" style="s2">standard the DES although we&#39;re cutting</p>
<p begin="02:24:49.430" end="02:24:56.090" style="s2">site and other stuff that eventually</p>
<p begin="02:24:51.020" end="02:24:59.990" style="s2">forth so they talked about rather than</p>
<p begin="02:24:56.090" end="02:25:02.780" style="s2">calling a intrinsic and extrinsic they</p>
<p begin="02:24:59.990" end="02:25:07.160" style="s2">talked about tax focusing versus goal</p>
<p begin="02:25:02.780" end="02:25:14.229" style="s2">focusing motivations and they got this</p>
<p begin="02:25:07.160" end="02:25:16.490" style="s2">published in the paper and I really okay</p>
<p begin="02:25:14.229" end="02:25:19.910" style="s2">isn&#39;t that just kind of well I&#39;m again</p>
<p begin="02:25:16.490" end="02:25:26.510" style="s2">meant by intrinsic and extrinsic focus</p>
<p begin="02:25:19.910" end="02:25:36.290" style="s2">versus goal focused anyways an appeal</p>
<p begin="02:25:26.510" end="02:25:38.090" style="s2">that also came back in 1993 and made a</p>
<p begin="02:25:36.290" end="02:25:45.439" style="s2">distinction between types of extrinsic</p>
<p begin="02:25:38.090" end="02:25:47.630" style="s2">motivation so she refined it and she</p>
<p begin="02:25:45.439" end="02:25:52.360" style="s2">wanted to say this not all extrinsic</p>
<p begin="02:25:47.630" end="02:25:55.970" style="s2">motivation was detrimental okay so why</p>
<p begin="02:25:52.360" end="02:25:59.600" style="s2">okay what kind of extrinsic motivation</p>
<p begin="02:25:55.970" end="02:26:01.729" style="s2">could be beneficial well if I take my</p>
<p begin="02:25:59.600" end="02:26:03.590" style="s2">eyes off the top and look at the goal</p>
<p begin="02:26:01.729" end="02:26:05.660" style="s2">but that gives me critical feedback</p>
<p begin="02:26:03.590" end="02:26:08.300" style="s2">survey then take back in order to</p>
<p begin="02:26:05.660" end="02:26:12.260" style="s2">reformulate my problem that can actually</p>
<p begin="02:26:08.300" end="02:26:14.899" style="s2">be beneficial to my system so you can</p>
<p begin="02:26:12.260" end="02:26:17.420" style="s2">use extrinsic motivation in order to</p>
<p begin="02:26:14.899" end="02:26:20.950" style="s2">reformulate how you&#39;re doing too fast</p>
<p begin="02:26:17.420" end="02:26:20.950" style="s2">you get critical feedback</p>
<p begin="02:26:22.050" end="02:26:29.489" style="s2">so she called this synergistic extrinsic</p>
<p begin="02:26:25.770" end="02:26:31.859" style="s2">motivation it provides information which</p>
<p begin="02:26:29.489" end="02:26:38.130" style="s2">app which acts in concert with and</p>
<p begin="02:26:31.859" end="02:26:41.010" style="s2">supports intrinsic motivation so if</p>
<p begin="02:26:38.130" end="02:26:43.380" style="s2">you&#39;ll allow me an analogy right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:26:41.010" end="02:26:45.720" style="s2">kind of like right the returning after</p>
<p begin="02:26:43.380" end="02:26:47.609" style="s2">father&#39;s is to leave and come back and</p>
<p begin="02:26:45.720" end="02:26:49.819" style="s2">you&#39;re capable of reformulating your</p>

<p begin="02:26:49.970" end="02:26:56.489" style="s2">now obviously what&#39;s left of course is</p>
<p begin="02:26:53.010" end="02:26:58.859" style="s2">non synergistic motivators right so</p>
<p begin="02:26:56.489" end="02:27:01.529" style="s2">there&#39;s non center distich extrinsic</p>
<p begin="02:26:58.859" end="02:27:04.470" style="s2">motivation this case your eyes off the</p>
<p begin="02:27:01.529" end="02:27:06.810" style="s2">top focuses along the goal but does not</p>
<p begin="02:27:04.470" end="02:27:09.119" style="s2">afford you any kind of critical</p>
<p begin="02:27:06.810" end="02:27:11.579" style="s2">information for reformulating your task</p>
<p begin="02:27:09.119" end="02:27:14.779" style="s2">for the Ottoman target you just worried</p>
<p begin="02:27:11.579" end="02:27:14.779" style="s2">that you&#39;re not at your old date</p>
<p begin="02:27:21.511" end="02:27:29.940" style="s2">yes communication so synergistic</p>
<p begin="02:27:27.330" end="02:27:32.461" style="s2">extrinsic motivation gets right is</p>
<p begin="02:27:29.940" end="02:27:34.021" style="s2">actually synergistic it helps creativity</p>
<p begin="02:27:32.461" end="02:27:36.780" style="s2">because although he is taking your</p>
<p begin="02:27:34.021" end="02:27:38.851" style="s2">attention off the task by looking at the</p>
<p begin="02:27:36.780" end="02:27:40.711" style="s2">goal you need with them up with critical</p>
<p begin="02:27:38.851" end="02:27:43.171" style="s2">feedback that you then used to</p>
<p begin="02:27:40.711" end="02:27:45.240" style="s2">reformulate the task and that improves</p>
<p begin="02:27:43.171" end="02:27:48.650" style="s2">your involvement with your taxes</p>
<p begin="02:27:45.240" end="02:27:49.891" style="s2">increases your flexibility perhaps etc</p>
<p begin="02:27:48.650" end="02:27:51.721" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="02:27:49.891" end="02:28:03.900" style="s2">kind of like a conviction that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="02:27:51.721" end="02:28:06.841" style="s2">met with the analogy okay so around this</p>
<p begin="02:28:03.900" end="02:28:10.620" style="s2">time what happened is that people were</p>
<p begin="02:28:06.841" end="02:28:11.820" style="s2">now starting to look more and this is</p>
<p begin="02:28:10.620" end="02:28:14.040" style="s2">the language that was used I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="02:28:11.820" end="02:28:17.721" style="s2">including this language on not the</p>
<p begin="02:28:14.040" end="02:28:23.190" style="s2">framing a problem but the framing of</p>
<p begin="02:28:17.721" end="02:28:25.921" style="s2">motivation because pro-russia talking</p>
<p begin="02:28:23.190" end="02:28:28.290" style="s2">about here right is where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:28:25.921" end="02:28:30.271" style="s2">directing attention what is being for</p>
<p begin="02:28:28.290" end="02:28:34.790" style="s2">granted what is being backgrounded and</p>
<p begin="02:28:30.271" end="02:28:34.790" style="s2">how much flexibility we have enough</p>
<p begin="02:28:46.940" end="02:28:51.880" style="s2">so what says that happened is that</p>
<p begin="02:28:48.771" end="02:28:53.870" style="s2">people were trying to come up with</p>
<p begin="02:28:51.880" end="02:28:58.010" style="s2">accounts of what you may call the</p>
<p begin="02:28:53.870" end="02:29:01.160" style="s2">cognitive aspects of notation we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:28:58.010" end="02:29:04.370" style="s2">going to find it then a hot button of</p>
<p begin="02:29:01.160" end="02:29:07.880" style="s2">course will just introduce it today we</p>
<p begin="02:29:04.370" end="02:29:09.980" style="s2">want next week is the work of Michael</p>
<p begin="02:29:07.880" end="02:29:12.710" style="s2">after in what&#39;s called reversal theory</p>
<p begin="02:29:09.980" end="02:29:16.070" style="s2">reversal theory now what&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="02:29:12.710" end="02:29:19.700" style="s2">the movies my thinking is it&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="02:29:16.070" end="02:29:23.330" style="s2">important connections but he also starts</p>
<p begin="02:29:19.700" end="02:29:29.021" style="s2">from the gestalt heritage of one candle</p>
<p begin="02:29:23.330" end="02:29:31.910" style="s2">the effect also explicitly does so now</p>
<p begin="02:29:29.021" end="02:29:35.620" style="s2">he has what he calls a meta motivational</p>
<p begin="02:29:31.910" end="02:29:35.620" style="s2">theory on matter motivational theory</p>
<p begin="02:29:41.249" end="02:29:51.739" style="s2">the basic idea is that motivation is a</p>
<p begin="02:29:44.369" end="02:29:55.020" style="s2">framing of your level of arousal and</p>
<p begin="02:29:51.739" end="02:29:59.069" style="s2">then that framing of your level of</p>
<p begin="02:29:55.020" end="02:30:01.709" style="s2">arousal has an impact on how your</p>
<p begin="02:29:59.069" end="02:30:03.989" style="s2">attention is directed which then have a</p>
<p begin="02:30:01.709" end="02:30:05.779" style="s2">new topic in problem solving and then</p>
<p begin="02:30:03.989" end="02:30:19.619" style="s2">this would be a more comprehensive</p>
<p begin="02:30:05.779" end="02:30:21.119" style="s2">motivational theory creativity so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:30:19.619" end="02:30:22.619" style="s2">going to only have five minutes and</p>
<p begin="02:30:21.119" end="02:30:24.359" style="s2">floating farther than this will be</p>
<p begin="02:30:22.619" end="02:30:26.430" style="s2">irrelevant I only stay for four o&#39;clock</p>
<p begin="02:30:24.359" end="02:30:28.829" style="s2">so I&#39;m going to answer yourself and I</p>
<p begin="02:30:26.430" end="02:30:31.439" style="s2">have to lead up for so a healthy</p>
<p begin="02:30:28.829" end="02:30:35.069" style="s2">convergent question but what we&#39;re now</p>
<p begin="02:30:31.439" end="02:30:37.560" style="s2">moving towards is how what is the theory</p>
<p begin="02:30:35.069" end="02:30:39.420" style="s2">and okay is that the basic idea is you</p>
<p begin="02:30:37.560" end="02:30:43.409" style="s2">have different medical better</p>
<p begin="02:30:39.420" end="02:30:44.999" style="s2">motivational modes and only one of those</p>
<p begin="02:30:43.409" end="02:30:48.689" style="s2">modes is actually conducive to</p>
<p begin="02:30:44.999" end="02:30:53.239" style="s2">creativity so what we&#39;re going to see is</p>
<p begin="02:30:48.689" end="02:30:56.010" style="s2">how you frame your level of arousal</p>
<p begin="02:30:53.239" end="02:31:01.079" style="s2">significantly impacts how you direct</p>
<p begin="02:30:56.010" end="02:31:05.100" style="s2">attention which then has a huge impact</p>
<p begin="02:31:01.079" end="02:31:08.159" style="s2">on your problem-solving and that would</p>
<p begin="02:31:05.100" end="02:31:12.539" style="s2">then be right and motivational theories</p>
<p begin="02:31:08.159" end="02:31:14.970" style="s2">of creative creative people to motivate</p>
<p begin="02:31:12.539" end="02:31:17.399" style="s2">themselves in the right way to get</p>
<p begin="02:31:14.970" end="02:31:19.590" style="s2">themselves need to write the right</p>
<p begin="02:31:17.399" end="02:31:21.869" style="s2">framing of their own arousal so that</p>
<p begin="02:31:19.590" end="02:31:27.199" style="s2">they direct attention in a way that is</p>
<p begin="02:31:21.869" end="02:31:27.199" style="s2">optimal or none of it exists</p>
<p begin="02:31:27.221" end="02:31:39.330" style="s2">I don&#39;t think that time is ready I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:31:37.841" end="02:31:44.190" style="s2">think so</p>
<p begin="02:31:39.330" end="02:31:44.190" style="s2">all right thank you for your attention</p>
