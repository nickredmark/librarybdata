<p begin="00:00:19.650" end="00:00:23.369" style="s2">think that we&#39;ve had on the program we</p>

<p begin="00:00:23.369" end="00:00:30.900" style="s2">had healthy guests we&#39;ve had help in</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.380" end="00:00:32.850" style="s2">shellfish okay yeah and what I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.900" end="00:00:38.010" style="s2">talk to you about is a little bit this</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.850" end="00:00:41.700" style="s2">issue of how we sort through our bodies</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.010" end="00:00:44.430" style="s2">and our minds as mechanical systems what</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.700" end="00:00:46.860" style="s2">do we do with integrating the tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.430" end="00:00:51.770" style="s2">amount of information some some of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.860" end="00:00:54.600" style="s2">literature in the biomedical field is</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.770" end="00:00:56.370" style="s2">almost unreadable and it&#39;s extremely</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.600" end="00:00:58.219" style="s2">confusing you have small studies you</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.370" end="00:01:01.920" style="s2">don&#39;t have a lot of discipline across</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.219" end="00:01:05.700" style="s2">different different fields to keep any</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.920" end="00:01:07.229" style="s2">kind of interoperability and so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.700" end="00:01:09.119" style="s2">always been afraid to enter this space</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.229" end="00:01:10.890" style="s2">but you&#39;ve been recommended is one of</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.119" end="00:01:12.810" style="s2">the countries or if not the world&#39;s top</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.890" end="00:01:14.580" style="s2">trainers you&#39;ve been an extreme athlete</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.810" end="00:01:16.409" style="s2">you&#39;ve been studying this from an</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.580" end="00:01:19.710" style="s2">academic perspective and you seem the</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.409" end="00:01:21.509" style="s2">ideal person to be our jungle guide into</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.710" end="00:01:23.880" style="s2">the wilds of what is known about us</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.509" end="00:01:25.799" style="s2">aside from the extreme athlete piece</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.880" end="00:01:28.049" style="s2">I don&#39;t think masochism lends any any</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.799" end="00:01:29.700" style="s2">great deal of credibility to one aside</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.049" end="00:01:31.979" style="s2">from a little bit of time spent testing</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.700" end="00:01:34.100" style="s2">things like you know ketones and</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.979" end="00:01:35.759" style="s2">carbohydrate mixes in the trenches and</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.100" end="00:01:38.490" style="s2">finding out what might give you</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.759" end="00:01:40.170" style="s2">explosive diarrhea but uh but I I do</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.490" end="00:01:43.310" style="s2">love to read I love to study this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.170" end="00:01:45.329" style="s2">I&#39;ve always been a voracious and curious</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.310" end="00:01:46.920" style="s2">consumer I just figure if we can profit</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.329" end="00:01:48.689" style="s2">from your pain that seems like a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.920" end="00:01:51.240" style="s2">good deal well yeah yeah maybe a little</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.689" end="00:01:53.850" style="s2">bit but yeah you&#39;re right it is</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.240" end="00:01:56.130" style="s2">difficult with you know closed access to</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.850" end="00:01:57.659" style="s2">many of these journals and you know the</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.130" end="00:02:00.119" style="s2">ability to be able to review an abstract</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.659" end="00:02:01.649" style="s2">and as we were discussing before we</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.119" end="00:02:04.590" style="s2">started recording you know an inability</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.649" end="00:02:06.229" style="s2">to determine whether or not a fasting</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.590" end="00:02:08.879" style="s2">study was done on a male or a female</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.229" end="00:02:12.000" style="s2">population or you know whether or not a</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.879" end="00:02:14.160" style="s2">headline that might say vilify red meat</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.000" end="00:02:18.330" style="s2">is actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.160" end="00:02:21.210" style="s2">at the lifestyle practices of the people</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.330" end="00:02:23.400" style="s2">consuming said meats or the the sourcing</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.210" end="00:02:27.360" style="s2">you know process versus unprocessed</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.400" end="00:02:31.740" style="s2">there&#39;s just so many so many nuances to</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.360" end="00:02:34.710" style="s2">take into consideration and I think the</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.740" end="00:02:37.820" style="s2">saving grace though is that we live in</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.710" end="00:02:40.970" style="s2">an era now where the type of self</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.820" end="00:02:44.880" style="s2">quantification that would have been</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.970" end="00:02:47.010" style="s2">prohibitively expensive ten years ago is</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.880" end="00:02:48.420" style="s2">now readily affordable and available in</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.010" end="00:02:53.460" style="s2">the comfort of your own home in many</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.420" end="00:02:55.590" style="s2">cases and so I think that and we we can</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.460" end="00:02:57.390" style="s2">delve into this if you would like the</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.590" end="00:03:00.240" style="s2">ability to be able to gather data about</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.390" end="00:03:02.250" style="s2">your own body and then decide what type</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.240" end="00:03:04.170" style="s2">of nutrition or exercise</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.250" end="00:03:06.510" style="s2">I just loved inhalation protocol would</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.170" end="00:03:08.520" style="s2">be appropriate for you allows you to</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.510" end="00:03:10.460" style="s2">bypass a lot of this epidemiological</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.520" end="00:03:13.140" style="s2">data that paints with a very broad brush</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.460" end="00:03:14.430" style="s2">so these are all great topics I mean one</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.140" end="00:03:15.960" style="s2">of the great mysteries since you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.430" end="00:03:17.550" style="s2">already brought up explosive diarrhea</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.960" end="00:03:19.680" style="s2">we&#39;ve probably lost now for illicit</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.550" end="00:03:23.040" style="s2">herbs with that one is why is my you</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.680" end="00:03:26.820" style="s2">know why is my toilet not a laboratory</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.040" end="00:03:28.650" style="s2">that isn&#39;t always taking data away from</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.820" end="00:03:31.290" style="s2">what I&#39;m passing through me right or</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.650" end="00:03:32.850" style="s2">your toilet paper exactly well your</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.290" end="00:03:35.520" style="s2">toilet paper and a dongle on your iPhone</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.850" end="00:03:37.920" style="s2">and yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s one of the tests</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.520" end="00:03:40.610" style="s2">that&#39;s certainly very helpful I I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.920" end="00:03:42.990" style="s2">actually more helpful than these newer</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.610" end="00:03:45.840" style="s2">microbiome companies that are making a</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.990" end="00:03:48.959" style="s2">lot of predictions based on biome data</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.840" end="00:03:52.050" style="s2">collected from stool that don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.959" end="00:03:53.459" style="s2">lot of research behind them such as you</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.050" end="00:03:55.290" style="s2">know we&#39;ve tested your stool and</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.459" end="00:03:57.720" style="s2">determine that based on your biome data</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.290" end="00:03:59.209" style="s2">you should be on X Y Z probiotic that we</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.720" end="00:04:01.650" style="s2">are by the way manufacturing and selling</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.209" end="00:04:04.560" style="s2">but there are other tests that you can</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.650" end="00:04:06.780" style="s2">do that I think are very helpful and we</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.560" end="00:04:08.040" style="s2">we can start with the bathroom since</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.780" end="00:04:10.050" style="s2">we&#39;re there already</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.040" end="00:04:11.970" style="s2">not literally we&#39;re gonna have to get</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.050" end="00:04:13.020" style="s2">back to like it just introduced to you</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.970" end="00:04:14.490" style="s2">but we&#39;re already you&#39;re not actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.020" end="00:04:17.400" style="s2">sitting on porcelain these chairs are</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.490" end="00:04:20.100" style="s2">more comfortable the there are tests</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.400" end="00:04:22.290" style="s2">like you know I run once a year a test</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.100" end="00:04:24.810" style="s2">from Genova Diagnostics it&#39;s a three-day</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.290" end="00:04:27.500" style="s2">stool panel and a multi-day collection</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.810" end="00:04:30.110" style="s2">is important because you&#39;re every</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.500" end="00:04:31.820" style="s2">from parasitic activity to yeast fungus</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.110" end="00:04:33.920" style="s2">bacteria all that changes on a</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.820" end="00:04:36.220" style="s2">day-to-day basis and you can learn a</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.920" end="00:04:38.090" style="s2">great deal about your gut and</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.220" end="00:04:40.220" style="s2">inflammatory markers in your gut</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.090" end="00:04:43.340" style="s2">bacterial balance the presence or</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.220" end="00:04:46.610" style="s2">absence of parasites or you know yeasts</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.340" end="00:04:48.770" style="s2">or something like Candida for example by</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.610" end="00:04:51.740" style="s2">simply on a yearly basis doing doing a</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.770" end="00:04:54.410" style="s2">panel like this you literally for three</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.740" end="00:04:57.290" style="s2">days in a row just swab and it goes into</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.410" end="00:04:59.780" style="s2">a little tube you keep that much of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.290" end="00:05:01.970" style="s2">chagrin of my wife typically in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.780" end="00:05:04.370" style="s2">refrigerator until all your your poop is</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.970" end="00:05:06.740" style="s2">ready to ship off to FedEx right and you</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.370" end="00:05:08.810" style="s2">receive a beautiful PDF in two weeks</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.740" end="00:05:11.600" style="s2">that&#39;s got everything you would need to</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.810" end="00:05:13.850" style="s2">know about whether or not you might need</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.600" end="00:05:15.710" style="s2">to say supplement with a digestive</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.850" end="00:05:18.169" style="s2">enzyme because you have low pancreatic</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.710" end="00:05:20.120" style="s2">enzyme production or whether you</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.169" end="00:05:21.830" style="s2">actually do need to take that popular</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.120" end="00:05:23.900" style="s2">cleansing supplements because you have</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.830" end="00:05:25.100" style="s2">some kind of a parasitic overgrowth or</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.900" end="00:05:26.390" style="s2">something like I&#39;m gonna actually want</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.100" end="00:05:29.630" style="s2">to get back to this issue of your wife</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.390" end="00:05:32.750" style="s2">because I think the issue of whether or</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.630" end="00:05:35.810" style="s2">not your behavior is viewed as bizarre</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.750" end="00:05:37.820" style="s2">by your family has a lot to do with</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.810" end="00:05:39.820" style="s2">whether or not most people can stick to</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.820" end="00:05:44.390" style="s2">a regime I mean I am someone who</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.820" end="00:05:46.640" style="s2">believes that in general institutional</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.390" end="00:05:49.160" style="s2">wisdom is usually so polluted by the</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.640" end="00:05:52.570" style="s2">economic incentives of the institutions</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.160" end="00:05:55.940" style="s2">that I&#39;m always open to the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.570" end="00:05:57.919" style="s2">the conventional wisdom is exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.940" end="00:06:00.020" style="s2">you would expect when institutions have</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.919" end="00:06:02.530" style="s2">perverse incentives but if everyone in</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.020" end="00:06:07.100" style="s2">your family or your social environment</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.530" end="00:06:08.900" style="s2">doesn&#39;t worry about these things the</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.100" end="00:06:11.930" style="s2">same way you might and isn&#39;t sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.900" end="00:06:14.180" style="s2">willing to take responsibility for you</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.930" end="00:06:17.990" style="s2">know you break it you bought it style</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.180" end="00:06:19.130" style="s2">approach can be very difficult to you</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.990" end="00:06:20.660" style="s2">know to get somebody to go along with</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.130" end="00:06:23.090" style="s2">putting your stool in the refrigerators</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.660" end="00:06:25.130" style="s2">if that was normal let&#39;s let&#39;s get to</p>

<p begin="00:06:25.130" end="00:06:32.479" style="s2">of get some sacrum from yeah can you</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.650" end="00:06:37.280" style="s2">just give us a very quick sketch of your</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.479" end="00:06:39.050" style="s2">academic and non-academic experience</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.280" end="00:06:40.580" style="s2">that brings you to being one of the most</p>

<p begin="00:06:40.580" end="00:06:49.460" style="s2">fitness experts yes academically I</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.939" end="00:06:51.110" style="s2">attended University of Idaho not</p>

<p begin="00:06:55.129" end="00:07:00.500" style="s2">exercise physiology and biomechanics</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.110" end="00:07:03.139" style="s2">there because for for most of my younger</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.500" end="00:07:05.479" style="s2">years I was most interested in exploring</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.139" end="00:07:07.400" style="s2">the boundaries of human performance and</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.479" end="00:07:10.099" style="s2">how to maximize human performance which</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.400" end="00:07:12.710" style="s2">in retrospect is a far cry from</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.099" end="00:07:14.360" style="s2">enhancing health or longevity and there</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.710" end="00:07:16.340" style="s2">are many people who are you know fit on</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.360" end="00:07:18.740" style="s2">the outside but once you take a look at</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.340" end="00:07:20.719" style="s2">blood and biomarkers and what make me go</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.740" end="00:07:21.650" style="s2">exactly yeah some of the self</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.719" end="00:07:24.169" style="s2">quantification we were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.650" end="00:07:27.289" style="s2">earlier it actually can often fly in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.169" end="00:07:30.379" style="s2">face of longevity to be operating at</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.289" end="00:07:33.500" style="s2">peak performance however I studied that</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.379" end="00:07:36.319" style="s2">at University of Idaho and competed in</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.500" end="00:07:38.750" style="s2">in tennis and in bodybuilding and water</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.319" end="00:07:42.610" style="s2">polo and volleyball just played a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.750" end="00:07:45.409" style="s2">sports and progressed from there to</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.610" end="00:07:48.500" style="s2">almost 20 years of competing in</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.409" end="00:07:50.090" style="s2">professional endurance sports and doing</p>

<p begin="00:08:02.900" end="00:08:07.219" style="s2">standpoint because those are those are</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.300" end="00:08:10.699" style="s2">really sports of attrition right where</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.219" end="00:08:13.789" style="s2">you must have pretty robust management</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.699" end="00:08:16.370" style="s2">of everything from macronutrients to</p>

<p begin="00:11:04.720" end="00:11:09.970" style="s2">perspective was that heart rate</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.220" end="00:11:15.639" style="s2">variability was the best concrete marker</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.970" end="00:11:17.620" style="s2">to target to proxy for improving</p>

<p begin="00:11:21.549" end="00:11:28.329" style="s2">can you get back to him absolutely I</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.129" end="00:11:30.610" style="s2">would say pushing aside some of the more</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.329" end="00:11:32.649" style="s2">fringe markers out there that you can</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.610" end="00:11:35.290" style="s2">track for longevity let&#39;s say there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.649" end="00:11:38.379" style="s2">something like telomere length or or a</p>

<p begin="00:11:38.379" end="00:11:41.470" style="s2">these things that are close fringe I</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.850" end="00:11:43.949" style="s2">would say that they&#39;re just bad proxies</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.470" end="00:11:48.009" style="s2">yeah they&#39;re poor proxies they&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.949" end="00:11:49.660" style="s2">less they&#39;re less available and less</p>

<p begin="00:11:51.610" end="00:11:57.370" style="s2">yeah compared to what I would consider</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.499" end="00:12:00.129" style="s2">to be three very useful markers to track</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.370" end="00:12:03.040" style="s2">overall health and longevity and that</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.129" end="00:12:04.600" style="s2">would be glycemic variability and how</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.040" end="00:12:06.610" style="s2">often is the blood sugar fluctuating</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.600" end="00:12:08.589" style="s2">throughout the day and to what extent is</p>

<p begin="00:12:31.990" end="00:12:37.529" style="s2">allowed me to see everything from blood</p>

<p begin="00:12:43.029" end="00:12:49.419" style="s2">learned some very interesting things for</p>

<p begin="00:12:49.419" end="00:12:53.079" style="s2">dramatically in response to a cup of</p>

<p begin="00:12:55.209" end="00:12:58.659" style="s2">and you know it gives you a surge of</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.949" end="00:13:00.339" style="s2">energy and that sugar assuming that the</p>

<p begin="00:13:30.100" end="00:13:34.720" style="s2">because of that I went out and got what</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.170" end="00:13:36.760" style="s2">I would consider to be one of the gold</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.720" end="00:13:38.620" style="s2">standard food allergy tests out there</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.760" end="00:13:41.620" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t give you a laundry list of</p>

<p begin="00:14:04.570" end="00:14:10.270" style="s2">deeply into I also found something very</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.180" end="00:14:11.770" style="s2">useful and quite useful for us since</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.270" end="00:14:14.800" style="s2">we&#39;re sitting in a cold room right now</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.770" end="00:14:16.690" style="s2">the the best thing I could do to lower</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.800" end="00:14:18.670" style="s2">glycemic variability and keep my blood</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.690" end="00:14:21.340" style="s2">glucose stable the entire day was a</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.670" end="00:14:23.110" style="s2">brief bout of cold in the morning just</p>

<p begin="00:14:28.690" end="00:14:33.730" style="s2">day so glycemic variability would be one</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.810" end="00:14:36.300" style="s2">thing that I think is important to</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.730" end="00:14:38.920" style="s2">measure inflammation would be a second</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.300" end="00:14:41.680" style="s2">inflammation is a little bit trickier</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.920" end="00:14:47.130" style="s2">because it does require a blood</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.680" end="00:14:49.630" style="s2">measurement that&#39;s typically right now</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.130" end="00:14:51.190" style="s2">requires you go to it to a lab to do a</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.630" end="00:14:53.230" style="s2">blood draw but I&#39;m talking about getting</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.190" end="00:14:55.300" style="s2">a measurement of something like HSC RP</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.230" end="00:14:57.280" style="s2">to see if your your C reactive protein</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.300" end="00:15:00.070" style="s2">is low there are other inflammatory</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.280" end="00:15:03.850" style="s2">markers like fibrinogen or homocysteine</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.070" end="00:15:05.350" style="s2">or cytokines that you can measure but</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.850" end="00:15:07.720" style="s2">but doing something like a quarterly</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.350" end="00:15:09.700" style="s2">measurement of just your HSC RP levels</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.720" end="00:15:12.250" style="s2">you know that&#39;s that&#39;s a 30 to $40 lab</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.700" end="00:15:14.770" style="s2">test that you can run that also is</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.250" end="00:15:16.330" style="s2">because inflammation is so tied to</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.770" end="00:15:17.870" style="s2">stress on a variety of other health</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.330" end="00:15:20.420" style="s2">conditions you see they responded</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.870" end="00:15:22.339" style="s2">something like dairy it can respond to</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.420" end="00:15:24.110" style="s2">food allergies it can respond to stress</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.339" end="00:15:25.880" style="s2">it can respond to and this is something</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.110" end="00:15:28.700" style="s2">to be careful with in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.880" end="00:15:31.430" style="s2">timing of when you run the test exercise</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.700" end="00:15:33.800" style="s2">can elevate it significantly which is</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.430" end="00:15:36.110" style="s2">why sometimes if someone does a hard</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.800" end="00:15:38.150" style="s2">weight training session or a run then</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.110" end="00:15:39.740" style="s2">does their fasted lab test the next</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.150" end="00:15:41.810" style="s2">morning the results come back show</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.740" end="00:15:43.400" style="s2">elevated CRP and a doctor wants them to</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.810" end="00:15:45.740" style="s2">go in for a heart panel and spend a</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.400" end="00:15:48.020" style="s2">whole bunch of money when their CRP was</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.740" end="00:15:49.970" style="s2">just elevated due to the size the diaper</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.020" end="00:15:53.810" style="s2">the newest monitoring is that it has</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.970" end="00:15:56.600" style="s2">really shown us just how inadequate it</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.810" end="00:15:58.430" style="s2">is to pick some random moment things</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.600" end="00:16:00.380" style="s2">then might decide that that is where</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.430" end="00:16:01.880" style="s2">your body is because your body may just</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.380" end="00:16:03.680" style="s2">be passing through that value of</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.880" end="00:16:05.690" style="s2">whatever it is it needs to precisely</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.680" end="00:16:07.430" style="s2">controlled and when you look at hormones</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.690" end="00:16:09.650" style="s2">it&#39;s even more important because if you</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.430" end="00:16:11.300" style="s2">look at the the gold standard right now</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.650" end="00:16:13.430" style="s2">for hormone measurement at least what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.300" end="00:16:14.930" style="s2">used predominantly and then we can get</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.430" end="00:16:16.100" style="s2">back to heart rate variability which I</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.930" end="00:16:17.720" style="s2">would consider to be the third</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.100" end="00:16:19.960" style="s2">measurement to look at in addition to</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.720" end="00:16:21.980" style="s2">glycemic variability and inflammation</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.960" end="00:16:24.650" style="s2">but when you look at hormones for</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.980" end="00:16:26.950" style="s2">example you know most tests are running</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.650" end="00:16:31.490" style="s2">a fasted blood draw in the morning of</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.950" end="00:16:34.220" style="s2">testosterone estrogen DHEA what have you</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.490" end="00:16:37.430" style="s2">but hormones fluctuate widely throughout</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.220" end="00:16:39.020" style="s2">the day and because of this I think that</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.430" end="00:16:40.310" style="s2">that a urinary measurement for hormones</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.020" end="00:16:41.930" style="s2">you know there there&#39;s another test that</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.310" end="00:16:43.760" style="s2">that I think is great for self</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.930" end="00:16:45.709" style="s2">quantification it&#39;s called a Dutch panel</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.760" end="00:16:48.050" style="s2">- dried urine test you pee on a stick</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.709" end="00:16:49.550" style="s2">five times during the day and you get a</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.050" end="00:16:50.990" style="s2">running value of where your hormone</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.550" end="00:16:53.270" style="s2">levels are fluctuating throughout the</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.990" end="00:16:55.339" style="s2">entire day so that you can see if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.270" end="00:16:57.500" style="s2">truly whatever high cortisol low</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.339" end="00:17:00.529" style="s2">cortisol high testosterone low</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.500" end="00:17:02.600" style="s2">testosterone etc and furthermore urine</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.529" end="00:17:05.179" style="s2">tests will show you the upstream and</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.600" end="00:17:07.520" style="s2">downstream metabolites of a hormone and</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.179" end="00:17:09.709" style="s2">the reason that&#39;s important is because</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.520" end="00:17:11.650" style="s2">many people will for example get a blood</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.709" end="00:17:14.420" style="s2">measurement of their cortisol levels and</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.650" end="00:17:16.880" style="s2">see that they have very let&#39;s say very</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.420" end="00:17:18.260" style="s2">low cortisol and some you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.880" end="00:17:19.939" style="s2">functional medicine doctor or</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.260" end="00:17:21.079" style="s2">naturopathic physician or something like</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.939" end="00:17:22.520" style="s2">that will tell them to have adrenal</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.079" end="00:17:24.350" style="s2">fatigue you know your adrenals are</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.520" end="00:17:26.709" style="s2">pooped out you&#39;re not making cortisol</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.350" end="00:17:28.929" style="s2">you need to stop exercising and</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.709" end="00:17:31.600" style="s2">but the possible retreat for for ten</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.929" end="00:17:33.970" style="s2">days or whatever and it turns out that</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.600" end="00:17:36.309" style="s2">for example and highly active exercising</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.970" end="00:17:38.529" style="s2">individual who is producing cortisol</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.309" end="00:17:40.450" style="s2">just fine cortisol gets turned over very</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.529" end="00:17:42.190" style="s2">quickly and you aren&#39;t going to see this</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.450" end="00:17:43.570" style="s2">on a blood test but on a urine test you</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.190" end="00:17:45.940" style="s2">would see high levels of cortisol</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.570" end="00:17:48.340" style="s2">metabolites minha cortisol is being</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.940" end="00:17:50.620" style="s2">produced just fine by the adrenal glands</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.340" end="00:17:54.190" style="s2">but it&#39;s being cleared very quickly and</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.620" end="00:17:57.279" style="s2">so so paying attention to the actual the</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.190" end="00:17:58.330" style="s2">the fluids being used to to run the test</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.279" end="00:18:00.149" style="s2">is important as well</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.330" end="00:18:02.980" style="s2">you know so something like hormones</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.149" end="00:18:04.419" style="s2">should be tested via urine but for the</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.980" end="00:18:06.460" style="s2">inflammation piece you know just running</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.419" end="00:18:07.840" style="s2">like a quarterly blood panel to see if</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.460" end="00:18:10.510" style="s2">your inflammation is staying under</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.840" end="00:18:13.510" style="s2">control I think would be the second most</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.510" end="00:18:15.820" style="s2">useful measurement that is low-hanging</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.510" end="00:18:18.130" style="s2">fruit for a lot of people in addition to</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.820" end="00:18:19.779" style="s2">the blood glucose and then the final</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.130" end="00:18:21.460" style="s2">would be heart rate variability you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.779" end="00:18:24.130" style="s2">more about that given that we started</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.460" end="00:18:26.260" style="s2">yes yes fully define it so heart rate</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.130" end="00:18:27.700" style="s2">variability you know I wear for example</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.260" end="00:18:29.789" style="s2">a ring to track it</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.700" end="00:18:31.210" style="s2">there are wrist bands that track its</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.789" end="00:18:33.520" style="s2">bluetooth-enabled</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.210" end="00:18:34.840" style="s2">heart rate strap is a little bit more of</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.520" end="00:18:37.360" style="s2">a gold standard more accurate</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.840" end="00:18:39.250" style="s2">measurement but it is simply a</p>

<p begin="00:23:08.490" end="00:23:13.340" style="s2">fasting is a big part of that diet as</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.370" end="00:23:15.300" style="s2">well it&#39;s not just about you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.340" end="00:23:17.400" style="s2">unlimited breadsticks and goat cheese</p>

<p begin="00:23:19.170" end="00:23:24.920" style="s2">there are other components of that diet</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.460" end="00:23:27.930" style="s2">tied into the the religious aspect in</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.920" end="00:23:30.510" style="s2">almond you know such as in in meditation</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.930" end="00:23:32.100" style="s2">or the the breath work in yoga these</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.510" end="00:23:34.950" style="s2">things can tone the vagus nerve cold</p>

<p begin="00:23:34.950" end="00:23:39.780" style="s2">you know when a baby is first born and</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.260" end="00:23:41.520" style="s2">in many cultures would splash cold water</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.780" end="00:23:43.740" style="s2">in the baby&#39;s faces or for several</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.520" end="00:23:46.710" style="s2">months dunk a baby in cold water to tone</p>

<p begin="00:23:53.220" end="00:23:58.740" style="s2">work and so you can you can train and</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.250" end="00:24:00.540" style="s2">control heart rate variability and I</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.740" end="00:24:03.570" style="s2">really like that because it&#39;s so easy to</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.540" end="00:24:04.230" style="s2">track in real-time and I would say if</p>

<p begin="00:26:09.200" end="00:26:19.770" style="s2">don&#39;t necessarily think that you need to</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.670" end="00:26:22.110" style="s2">be immersed in the data of self</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.770" end="00:26:24.900" style="s2">quantification I think that there is a</p>

<p begin="00:26:26.820" end="00:26:32.220" style="s2">like a yearly comprehensive blood panel</p>

<p begin="00:26:38.910" end="00:26:43.110" style="s2">somebody tells me what is something</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.680" end="00:26:45.330" style="s2">means I start doing that thing to</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.110" end="00:26:47.550" style="s2">rectify the situation somebody else says</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.330" end="00:26:49.770" style="s2">well that&#39;s not what that means right</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.550" end="00:26:53.550" style="s2">and so my question I mean here&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.770" end="00:26:57.810" style="s2">ideal I&#39;d like to get the ten sharpest</p>

<p begin="00:26:57.810" end="00:27:03.720" style="s2">ask questions and watch them Duke it out</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.830" end="00:27:05.430" style="s2">intellectually so somebody could say</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.720" end="00:27:07.230" style="s2">well you know that&#39;s true in general but</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.430" end="00:27:08.670" style="s2">if you condition on this variable then</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.230" end="00:27:10.950" style="s2">that&#39;s no longer true because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.670" end="00:27:13.440" style="s2">just part of this natural response and</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.950" end="00:27:16.410" style="s2">it&#39;s a you know fair or not fair well</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.440" end="00:27:18.510" style="s2">that study you know really only looked</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.410" end="00:27:20.070" style="s2">at a very small sample that&#39;s the tricky</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.510" end="00:27:22.650" style="s2">part is the biochemical individuality</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.070" end="00:27:24.540" style="s2">and and Roger William I believe was back</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.650" end="00:27:27.060" style="s2">in the sixties wrote a wrote a book that</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.540" end="00:27:29.880" style="s2">dictated the the twelve different shapes</p>

<p begin="00:27:29.880" end="00:27:35.550" style="s2">and the fact that some people have</p>

<p begin="00:27:35.550" end="00:27:39.780" style="s2">rates and should therefore get plenty of</p>

<p begin="00:27:39.780" end="00:27:45.030" style="s2">with vitamin D whereas other people</p>

<p begin="00:27:54.570" end="00:27:57.930" style="s2">people will get gout and pain in their</p>

<p begin="00:28:02.100" end="00:28:09.150" style="s2">I mean that&#39;s the variability of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.800" end="00:28:11.160" style="s2">person under study I&#39;m saying that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:28:11.160" end="00:28:14.880" style="s2">which is understanding which particular</p>

<p begin="00:28:17.160" end="00:28:21.720" style="s2">then there&#39;s the other issue which is</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.010" end="00:28:24.510" style="s2">sort of sensitivity analysis for</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.720" end="00:28:27.110" style="s2">information that is if there is a slight</p>

<p begin="00:28:32.929" end="00:28:37.519" style="s2">the idea and then just to to get really</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.169" end="00:28:40.279" style="s2">into where I think a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.519" end="00:28:43.880" style="s2">problems go would go wrong go wrong</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.279" end="00:28:46.399" style="s2">I want to hear many more of these things</p>

<p begin="00:28:46.399" end="00:28:51.799" style="s2">where well this is good for you in this</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.130" end="00:28:55.039" style="s2">regard but probably bad for you in that</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.799" end="00:28:57.890" style="s2">regard whereas a lot of the advice is</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.039" end="00:28:59.299" style="s2">phrased in terms of that&#39;s a great thing</p>

<p begin="00:28:59.299" end="00:29:04.639" style="s2">and I just don&#39;t even believe in general</p>

<p begin="00:34:02.590" end="00:34:08.619" style="s2">difficult piece is curating and</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.030" end="00:34:10.119" style="s2">collecting all the laboratory</p>

<p begin="00:34:10.119" end="00:34:14.859" style="s2">most useful and actionable data cuz it</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.950" end="00:34:17.919" style="s2">can&#39;t just be you know I said like a</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.859" end="00:34:20.500" style="s2">micro needling you know a patch that you</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.919" end="00:34:22.450" style="s2">could you could put on your arm but we</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.500" end="00:34:23.950" style="s2">already talked about the urine we talked</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.450" end="00:34:26.349" style="s2">about the stool right you have to</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.950" end="00:34:28.690" style="s2">collect more more fluid from the body</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.349" end="00:34:30.909" style="s2">than just blood</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.690" end="00:34:35.290" style="s2">I wasn&#39;t feeling that should be done</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.909" end="00:34:37.060" style="s2">passively what do you mean my toilet</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.290" end="00:34:39.159" style="s2">should be a laboratory that&#39;d be amazing</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.060" end="00:34:41.710" style="s2">yeah be absolutely amazing I mean if it</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.159" end="00:34:44.379" style="s2">can have a I&#39;m confusing can ye the cold</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.710" end="00:34:45.940" style="s2">warm bidet hydration and and wipe your</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.379" end="00:34:47.440" style="s2">ass for you it should be able to class</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.940" end="00:34:49.690" style="s2">me that&#39;s to be like the Japanese</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.440" end="00:34:51.220" style="s2">thought about all sorts of aspects my</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.690" end="00:34:53.230" style="s2">comfort and luxury and what I really</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.220" end="00:34:55.149" style="s2">want to know is my markers yeah and and</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.230" end="00:34:57.760" style="s2">it shocks me that that doesn&#39;t yet exist</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.149" end="00:35:00.010" style="s2">the ability to be able to more easily</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.760" end="00:35:02.560" style="s2">and precisely quantify this and then</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.010" end="00:35:03.600" style="s2">have it fed into an algorithm that will</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.560" end="00:35:05.160" style="s2">spit out</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.600" end="00:35:09.690" style="s2">actionable data that&#39;s easy to</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.160" end="00:35:12.840" style="s2">understand but the fact is I should say</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.690" end="00:35:14.670" style="s2">to my knowledge it doesn&#39;t yet exist and</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.840" end="00:35:16.890" style="s2">I&#39;m pretty plugged into this sector when</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.670" end="00:35:18.750" style="s2">it comes to all the different ways out</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.890" end="00:35:19.950" style="s2">there that one can test and the</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.750" end="00:35:21.450" style="s2">different companies that are doing the</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.950" end="00:35:23.250" style="s2">testing and the information they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.450" end="00:35:25.680" style="s2">putting out and there&#39;s there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.250" end="00:35:29.490" style="s2">platform yet that&#39;s doing blood gut</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.680" end="00:35:31.380" style="s2">urine saliva heart rate variability and</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.490" end="00:35:33.050" style="s2">some of the other metrics you&#39;d get from</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.380" end="00:35:35.670" style="s2">a wearable device then taking that</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.050" end="00:35:38.700" style="s2">putting it through an algorithm and then</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.670" end="00:35:42.600" style="s2">pushing out the exact lifestyle dietary</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.700" end="00:35:45.210" style="s2">and supplementation or medication steps</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.600" end="00:35:47.520" style="s2">that someone could take to affect the</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.210" end="00:35:48.630" style="s2">biomarkers that tested well another</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.520" end="00:35:51.060" style="s2">thing that I would love to see this</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.630" end="00:35:57.120" style="s2">couple too is some sort of a software</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.060" end="00:36:02.460" style="s2">product that has the 15 leading health</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.120" end="00:36:05.880" style="s2">and performance experts talking about</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.460" end="00:36:07.470" style="s2">the same data so just the way you have</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.880" end="00:36:09.300" style="s2">market analysts and you want to see</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.470" end="00:36:10.890" style="s2">whether the market analysts are all</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.300" end="00:36:13.080" style="s2">talking to each other or whether they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.890" end="00:36:15.000" style="s2">disagreeing mm-hmm and then you want to</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.080" end="00:36:16.530" style="s2">listen in on the disagreements I mean</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.000" end="00:36:19.710" style="s2">one thing I&#39;d love to do is to have you</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.530" end="00:36:22.080" style="s2">back with three or four other people in</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.710" end="00:36:25.620" style="s2">your field who if you all respect each</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.080" end="00:36:27.680" style="s2">other and say well you know I think that</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.620" end="00:36:29.880" style="s2">that could easily be misinterpreted or</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.680" end="00:36:32.430" style="s2">you&#39;re taking us too far into the weeds</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.880" end="00:36:34.620" style="s2">or I think that that study has been</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.430" end="00:36:36.540" style="s2">given what far too much weight and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.620" end="00:36:38.730" style="s2">and and being you know people a toyed</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.540" end="00:36:41.520" style="s2">around with that I think you know Joe</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.730" end="00:36:44.970" style="s2">for example has hosted a meat plant</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.520" end="00:36:47.100" style="s2">debate yeah you know and there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.970" end="00:36:49.020" style="s2">chatter like that going on I personally</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.100" end="00:36:51.300" style="s2">don&#39;t really use my own podcast as a</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.020" end="00:36:54.500" style="s2">platform for for argumentation or debate</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.300" end="00:36:57.300" style="s2">as much as exploration of ideas but</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.500" end="00:37:00.210" style="s2">you&#39;re right it would be interesting I</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.300" end="00:37:01.770" style="s2">think it might just lend more confusion</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.210" end="00:37:05.040" style="s2">to the matter I don&#39;t think so I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.770" end="00:37:07.050" style="s2">this is that I&#39;m being a big Mis I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.040" end="00:37:13.380" style="s2">that one of the things that I&#39;m finding</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.050" end="00:37:15.000" style="s2">is that the public wants to listen in on</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.380" end="00:37:18.819" style="s2">conversations</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.000" end="00:37:22.180" style="s2">between people who are talking almost in</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.819" end="00:37:24.960" style="s2">tongues and then because they have the</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.180" end="00:37:26.650" style="s2">ability to slow it down and annotate</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.960" end="00:37:32.289" style="s2">like right now</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.650" end="00:37:34.299" style="s2">there is a a discord server that pours</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.289" end="00:37:36.339" style="s2">over every episode that I release of</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.299" end="00:37:38.230" style="s2">this podcast and these guys dissect</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.339" end="00:37:40.119" style="s2">everything that gets said they hyperlink</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.230" end="00:37:41.710" style="s2">it mm-hmm and they teach each other</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.119" end="00:37:45.039" style="s2">they&#39;re forming reading clubs and the</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.710" end="00:37:45.670" style="s2">whole thing and in the audio searchable</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.039" end="00:37:49.059" style="s2">now too</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.670" end="00:37:51.220" style="s2">well you know Google is searching audio</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.059" end="00:37:53.319" style="s2">I use an app called cast box it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.220" end="00:37:55.660" style="s2">fantastic I use it for all my podcasts</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.319" end="00:37:57.339" style="s2">not only because you can you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.660" end="00:37:58.690" style="s2">got good smoothing algorithms where you</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.339" end="00:38:00.940" style="s2">can play one two three and four times</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.690" end="00:38:02.470" style="s2">speed and it still sounds good but I can</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.940" end="00:38:04.779" style="s2">use the search function on that and it</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.470" end="00:38:06.579" style="s2">will search the audio let&#39;s say I want</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.779" end="00:38:08.769" style="s2">to learn about some random health</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.579" end="00:38:11.079" style="s2">concept like small intestine bacterial</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.769" end="00:38:13.119" style="s2">overgrowth I can search it&#39;ll scrape not</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.079" end="00:38:14.980" style="s2">just the show notes in the title and the</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.119" end="00:38:17.349" style="s2">description but the actual audio itself</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.980" end="00:38:19.960" style="s2">and I can go directly to the time stamp</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.349" end="00:38:22.720" style="s2">where that discussion begins and jump</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.960" end="00:38:24.339" style="s2">right in facilities IMF depends what the</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.720" end="00:38:25.990" style="s2">with the nature know how the fidelity</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.339" end="00:38:27.940" style="s2">feeds into it but it&#39;s it I&#39;m sorry</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.990" end="00:38:29.980" style="s2">serve ability of the transcripts right</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.940" end="00:38:31.750" style="s2">right no it&#39;s not searching the</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.980" end="00:38:36.700" style="s2">transcription it&#39;s searching the actual</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.750" end="00:38:39.930" style="s2">audio it&#39;s an audio search engine so if</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.700" end="00:38:45.549" style="s2">you say something that&#39;s technical I</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.930" end="00:38:48.460" style="s2">mean I guess I&#39;m just confused as to how</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.549" end="00:38:51.119" style="s2">you&#39;re saying it what I&#39;m saying is that</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.460" end="00:38:53.619" style="s2">let&#39;s say someone is searching for</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.119" end="00:38:57.210" style="s2">glycemic variability a term that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.619" end="00:38:59.859" style="s2">already used two or three times and</p>

<p begin="00:39:14.410" end="00:39:19.839" style="s2">results okay but it has that so view if</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.769" end="00:39:21.670" style="s2">you put in the search as a sound and</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.839" end="00:39:24.099" style="s2">then it&#39;s looking for some referable set</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.670" end="00:39:25.930" style="s2">exactly but it may miss it in a highly</p>

<p begin="00:39:25.930" end="00:39:28.270" style="s2">don&#39;t know that we&#39;re there that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.980" end="00:39:30.040" style="s2">hundred percent yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.270" end="00:39:32.860" style="s2">I don&#39;t know the level of accuracy but</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.040" end="00:39:35.860" style="s2">I&#39;ve found it to be of great utility so</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.860" end="00:39:37.540" style="s2">leaving that aside I mean the the point</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.860" end="00:39:42.550" style="s2">that I was trying to get at more was</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.540" end="00:39:45.090" style="s2">just that if you had like health UFC</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.550" end="00:39:47.770" style="s2">where experts go at it with each other</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.090" end="00:39:50.110" style="s2">with what&#39;s the old MTV the the death</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.770" end="00:39:52.540" style="s2">death death battle oh yeah yeah death</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.110" end="00:39:54.460" style="s2">battle does claymation exactly exactly</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.540" end="00:39:56.770" style="s2">well but I think that&#39;s what people want</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.460" end="00:40:01.480" style="s2">that and they they believe in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.770" end="00:40:04.030" style="s2">that once they can hear a group of</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.480" end="00:40:06.510" style="s2">experts sort of handle their concerns</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.030" end="00:40:09.490" style="s2">it&#39;s they don&#39;t have to be the one</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.510" end="00:40:12.510" style="s2">filtering what&#39;s what&#39;s durable and</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.490" end="00:40:16.780" style="s2">what&#39;s ephemeral what&#39;s what&#39;s a fad</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.510" end="00:40:18.490" style="s2">what is fairly solid I think you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.780" end="00:40:20.560" style="s2">that&#39;s the that&#39;s the great appeal of</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.490" end="00:40:22.600" style="s2">listening in on an expert conversation</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.560" end="00:40:25.960" style="s2">when you have a community that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.600" end="00:40:28.510" style="s2">actually dissecting it and is able to to</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.960" end="00:40:29.620" style="s2">do more with it yeah I think as long as</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.510" end="00:40:34.000" style="s2">people are aware of any pre-existing</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.620" end="00:40:36.550" style="s2">bias you know because there&#39;s from the</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.000" end="00:40:38.920" style="s2">the investments that that expert might</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.550" end="00:40:41.350" style="s2">be involved in to supplement companies</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.920" end="00:40:42.820" style="s2">they might own to the the dietary books</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.350" end="00:40:44.170" style="s2">that they wrote five years ago that</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.820" end="00:40:46.420" style="s2">they&#39;re still married to even though</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.170" end="00:40:47.830" style="s2">research has changed because those diet</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.420" end="00:40:49.570" style="s2">books have served them quite well from a</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.830" end="00:40:51.940" style="s2">monetization standpoint I mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.570" end="00:40:54.160" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of kind of back-end issues</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.940" end="00:40:56.230" style="s2">you got to pay attention to but but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.160" end="00:40:58.690" style="s2">I mean it would be interesting at least</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.230" end="00:41:01.470" style="s2">let me do something dangerous for my own</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.690" end="00:41:04.660" style="s2">podcast I have a few products that have</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.470" end="00:41:06.520" style="s2">health implications that some of which</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.660" end="00:41:08.620" style="s2">I&#39;ve come to really like are you</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.520" end="00:41:11.050" style="s2">familiar with any of these cooling</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.620" end="00:41:12.940" style="s2">systems for mattress pads so that you</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.050" end="00:41:17.770" style="s2">don&#39;t wake up in a pool of your own</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.940" end="00:41:20.230" style="s2">sweat yes the the bed jet I&#39;m familiar</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.770" end="00:41:22.780" style="s2">with that one which uses air to cool and</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.230" end="00:41:25.090" style="s2">then I personally use one called the</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.780" end="00:41:27.130" style="s2">cooler my wife has one as well I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.090" end="00:41:30.610" style="s2">think it&#39;s ever been flipped on you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.130" end="00:41:32.530" style="s2">returning to your your allusion to the</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.610" end="00:41:35.530" style="s2">to the bizarre health practices that</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.530" end="00:41:37.900" style="s2">spouses sometimes don&#39;t adopt but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.530" end="00:41:39.370" style="s2">the I think about the allure systems you</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.900" end="00:41:40.920" style="s2">and your one you don&#39;t have to have the</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.370" end="00:41:42.930" style="s2">same set yes yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.920" end="00:41:47.220" style="s2">and I find it useful yeah I can set it</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.930" end="00:41:48.960" style="s2">at 55 degrees you know I would say just</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.220" end="00:41:50.610" style="s2">when you look at a lot of the wearables</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.960" end="00:41:53.220" style="s2">out there one of the sleep metrics that</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.610" end="00:41:55.350" style="s2">people struggle with the most is deep</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.220" end="00:41:56.970" style="s2">sleep right during which a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.350" end="00:41:58.320" style="s2">nervous system repair and recovery is</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.970" end="00:42:00.360" style="s2">going to take place I mean memory</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.320" end="00:42:01.560" style="s2">consolidation and learning it or trim</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.360" end="00:42:03.030" style="s2">too long things like that whatever</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.560" end="00:42:04.680" style="s2">during dreaming you&#39;re in the during the</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.030" end="00:42:06.150" style="s2">lighter REM sleep stages but deep sleep</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.680" end="00:42:09.690" style="s2">is particularly important for recovery</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.150" end="00:42:12.330" style="s2">and seems to be the one that people</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.690" end="00:42:14.670" style="s2">struggle with the most and the two</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.330" end="00:42:17.340" style="s2">things I have found an impact deep sleep</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.670" end="00:42:20.040" style="s2">the highest are sleeping in a cool room</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.340" end="00:42:21.420" style="s2">sleeping on a cool surface if I&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.040" end="00:42:23.340" style="s2">anything to heat the body such as a</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.420" end="00:42:25.710" style="s2">heavy meal or heavy exercise session</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.340" end="00:42:27.300" style="s2">within three hours prior to bedtime some</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.710" end="00:42:29.880" style="s2">kind of cold walk or cold shower</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.300" end="00:42:32.760" style="s2">something to cool the body back down and</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.880" end="00:42:34.230" style="s2">wearing wool socks to bed and that where</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.760" end="00:42:36.900" style="s2">when you wear socks to bed it actually</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.230" end="00:42:39.300" style="s2">cools the rest of the body so that and</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.900" end="00:42:40.710" style="s2">higher dose CBD have been the two things</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.300" end="00:42:42.690" style="s2">that have increased my deep sleep the</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.710" end="00:42:44.730" style="s2">most so yeah I sleep on one of those</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.690" end="00:42:46.560" style="s2">pads so that&#39;s by the way that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.730" end="00:42:48.690" style="s2">spot the one that you sleep on is my</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.560" end="00:42:50.160" style="s2">sponsor then which I didn&#39;t mention yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.690" end="00:42:51.420" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m still confused about whether</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.160" end="00:42:53.310" style="s2">the calling at the chilly pad or the</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.420" end="00:42:56.100" style="s2">Euler but it&#39;s I think they have it on</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.310" end="00:43:00.300" style="s2">two different products yeah but that was</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.100" end="00:43:02.670" style="s2">my favorite find of 2019 because I</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.300" end="00:43:06.000" style="s2">didn&#39;t know and I again I liked the pad</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.670" end="00:43:08.310" style="s2">really cool yet I like the comforter to</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.000" end="00:43:10.530" style="s2">be really warm I don&#39;t even know what it</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.310" end="00:43:13.080" style="s2">is that I&#39;m interested in but it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.530" end="00:43:14.130" style="s2">interesting because there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.080" end="00:43:17.100" style="s2">actually a couple of interesting things</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.130" end="00:43:19.770" style="s2">hey I think it is at Stanford that they</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.100" end="00:43:22.710" style="s2">have researched now that cooling the</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.770" end="00:43:25.050" style="s2">forehead is particularly helpful for</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.710" end="00:43:26.370" style="s2">sleep latency meaning shortening the</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.050" end="00:43:28.860" style="s2">time that takes you to fall asleep so</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.370" end="00:43:29.370" style="s2">they&#39;ve just developed this company</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.860" end="00:43:32.490" style="s2">called</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.370" end="00:43:33.720" style="s2">I think it&#39;s AB I&#39;m not financially</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.490" end="00:43:36.150" style="s2">affiliated with them at all but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.720" end="00:43:39.390" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a headband that cools the</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.150" end="00:43:40.650" style="s2">head as you&#39;re falling asleep and and</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.390" end="00:43:43.820" style="s2">it&#39;s so much of the chilly paddocks if</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.650" end="00:43:46.830" style="s2">you wear it on your head and then the</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.820" end="00:43:49.380" style="s2">the the other piece tell me I have two</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.830" end="00:43:51.990" style="s2">wives into this what&#39;s I do wives think</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.380" end="00:43:53.990" style="s2">this is attractive looking no yes no on</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.990" end="00:43:57.319" style="s2">the least</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.990" end="00:44:00.410" style="s2">the chili pad can be set to to switch to</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.319" end="00:44:02.690" style="s2">a warm setting at whatever time you want</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.410" end="00:44:04.430" style="s2">to wake up so I slowly warm the bed as</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.690" end="00:44:05.839" style="s2">you wake I haven&#39;t messed around that</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.430" end="00:44:08.599" style="s2">function at all I just set it at 55</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.839" end="00:44:10.790" style="s2">degrees and pass out but it&#39;s useful so</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.599" end="00:44:12.680" style="s2">so I would say yes there&#39;s something to</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.790" end="00:44:15.230" style="s2">the idea of sleeping on a cool surface</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.680" end="00:44:18.470" style="s2">absolutely I remember the other thing I</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.230" end="00:44:19.400" style="s2">was going to say is you know people talk</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.470" end="00:44:21.530" style="s2">about sleep hygiene</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.400" end="00:44:24.559" style="s2">you know absence of light presence of</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.530" end="00:44:26.690" style="s2">cold a silent room right and I Lulla</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.559" end="00:44:29.150" style="s2">right my entire bedroom is red</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.690" end="00:44:30.619" style="s2">incandescent light bulbs because you</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.150" end="00:44:32.270" style="s2">don&#39;t have any suppression of melatonin</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.619" end="00:44:33.319" style="s2">levels when you flip off the lights at</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.270" end="00:44:35.930" style="s2">night to pee or when you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.319" end="00:44:38.359" style="s2">ready for bed at night but I think one</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.930" end="00:44:40.790" style="s2">thing that folks neglect in sleep</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.359" end="00:44:42.349" style="s2">hygiene is safety right this comes all</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.790" end="00:44:43.640" style="s2">the way back to the vagus nerve an</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.349" end="00:44:45.500" style="s2">activation of the parasympathetic</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.640" end="00:44:48.530" style="s2">nervous system the same reason that you</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.500" end="00:44:52.430" style="s2">would take three deep breaths and chew</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.530" end="00:44:55.940" style="s2">your - each bite of food with pretty</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.430" end="00:44:57.680" style="s2">high frequency if you are sleeping and</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.940" end="00:45:00.109" style="s2">your brain is convinced you&#39;re in a safe</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.680" end="00:45:01.069" style="s2">environment you sleep much better</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.109" end="00:45:02.089" style="s2">you know there&#39;s why so many people</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.069" end="00:45:06.230" style="s2">struggle with sleep when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.089" end="00:45:09.470" style="s2">traveling I have found one of the best</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.230" end="00:45:11.420" style="s2">things aside from never having my laptop</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.470" end="00:45:14.119" style="s2">in the bed because if my brain</p>

<p begin="00:47:28.579" end="00:47:32.509" style="s2">wonderful for neurogenesis and</p>

<p begin="00:48:01.759" end="00:48:06.499" style="s2">fan of mushrooms I think I think they</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.650" end="00:48:08.690" style="s2">have a lot of utility or you could be</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.499" end="00:48:10.519" style="s2">are you a fan of psychedelics and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.690" end="00:48:13.039" style="s2">happy to ask the question if I should</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.519" end="00:48:15.470" style="s2">yeah yeah I mean psilocybin particularly</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.039" end="00:48:18.019" style="s2">when when combined with lion&#39;s mane in</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.470" end="00:48:19.130" style="s2">small doses I&#39;m a fan of that as a</p>

<p begin="00:48:19.130" end="00:48:23.470" style="s2">Mike</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.950" end="00:48:28.210" style="s2">with psychedelics is that they have</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.470" end="00:48:34.150" style="s2">become it seems of late so culturally</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.210" end="00:48:35.680" style="s2">acceptable and also culturally</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.150" end="00:48:38.050" style="s2">acceptable and and more and more</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.680" end="00:48:41.020" style="s2">accessible that I think there there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.050" end="00:48:44.079" style="s2">some rampant abuse going on that is now</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.020" end="00:48:46.720" style="s2">justifiable you know whereas whatever</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.079" end="00:48:48.910" style="s2">dropping into a k-hole or doing ecstasy</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.720" end="00:48:51.310" style="s2">on the weekends you can now say you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.910" end="00:48:53.920" style="s2">using ketamine to manage some mild</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.310" end="00:48:57.430" style="s2">depression issues and you know using</p>

<p begin="00:49:02.500" end="00:49:08.079" style="s2">using LSD with with great frequency you</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.650" end="00:49:10.810" style="s2">know many people using that as like as a</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.079" end="00:49:12.460" style="s2">micro dose every day and the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.810" end="00:49:15.099" style="s2">you know you look at something like like</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.460" end="00:49:18.310" style="s2">ketamine or MDMA which people are using</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.099" end="00:49:19.630" style="s2">a lot of its neurotoxic and if you look</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.310" end="00:49:21.250" style="s2">at something like that was it&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.630" end="00:49:24.400" style="s2">the things that keep hearing going back</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.250" end="00:49:27.400" style="s2">and forth the neurotoxicity that how</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.400" end="00:49:29.349" style="s2">neurotoxic immediate it is in a trip</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.400" end="00:49:31.060" style="s2">dose it&#39;s definitely neurotoxic I would</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.349" end="00:49:32.349" style="s2">say a micro dose of ketamine for</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.060" end="00:49:35.500" style="s2">something like managing mild depression</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.349" end="00:49:36.819" style="s2">or anxiety is relatively safe but there</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.500" end="00:49:38.589" style="s2">are people using a lot more than that I</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.819" end="00:49:40.210" style="s2">mean I know people who are addicted to</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.589" end="00:49:42.280" style="s2">their ketamine nasal sprays and their</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.210" end="00:49:43.900" style="s2">their ketamine trophy&#39;s now and using</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.280" end="00:49:48.000" style="s2">those because there was there was an</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.900" end="00:49:51.250" style="s2">initial issue that a lot of the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.000" end="00:49:57.400" style="s2">Schedule one treatment of some of these</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.250" end="00:49:59.589" style="s2">drugs was so preposterous given the twin</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.400" end="00:50:02.170" style="s2">criterion that are supposed to define</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.589" end="00:50:05.200" style="s2">what goes on Schedule one that a high</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.170" end="00:50:07.569" style="s2">propensity for abuse when you know LSD</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.200" end="00:50:09.660" style="s2">is weirdly self-limiting for example and</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.569" end="00:50:13.359" style="s2">that the high degree of harm and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.660" end="00:50:15.640" style="s2">the I was shocked to find out that I had</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.359" end="00:50:18.099" style="s2">been propagandized and the thing harm</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.640" end="00:50:19.750" style="s2">had been the lethal dose of LSD is</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.099" end="00:50:22.089" style="s2">through the roof nobody&#39;s ever found it</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.750" end="00:50:24.099" style="s2">I think yeah i think i think the one</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.089" end="00:50:27.130" style="s2">elephant that they were able to kill and</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.099" end="00:50:28.720" style="s2">find a lethal dose of LSD for it turned</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.130" end="00:50:30.609" style="s2">out that it was actually the drug they</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.720" end="00:50:32.319" style="s2">were Co administering with the LSD some</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.609" end="00:50:33.460" style="s2">kind of a it was some kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.319" end="00:50:35.200" style="s2">tranquilizer or something</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.460" end="00:50:38.800" style="s2">you want to think about the elephant</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.200" end="00:50:41.380" style="s2">from berserk but but my concern is the</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.800" end="00:50:43.300" style="s2">potential for neurotransmitter depletion</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.380" end="00:50:44.980" style="s2">and imbalances due to overuse of</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.300" end="00:50:46.420" style="s2">psychedelics well as potential for</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.980" end="00:50:49.570" style="s2">neurotoxicity Olivia let me just clarify</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.420" end="00:50:55.710" style="s2">the question so my guess is that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.570" end="00:50:59.859" style="s2">gone through there was an initial lie</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.710" end="00:51:02.560" style="s2">the lie was found out to be a lie then</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.859" end="00:51:04.150" style="s2">there was a new lie that was told by</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.560" end="00:51:06.490" style="s2">those using the psychedelics that</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.150" end="00:51:10.480" style="s2">effectively these are not that dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.490" end="00:51:12.940" style="s2">that the load is quite modest and there</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.480" end="00:51:15.099" style="s2">are ways in which that might be true and</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.940" end="00:51:17.619" style="s2">there are ways in which that&#39;s not true</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.099" end="00:51:19.990" style="s2">even for something where the physical</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.619" end="00:51:23.440" style="s2">load is modest I mean I don&#39;t think we</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.990" end="00:51:25.599" style="s2">know how we&#39;re reordering the mind even</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.440" end="00:51:28.300" style="s2">if you don&#39;t find a strong physiological</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.599" end="00:51:30.849" style="s2">impact of something like LSD and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.300" end="00:51:35.910" style="s2">that that&#39;s my concern is serotonin</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.849" end="00:51:39.520" style="s2">imbalance dopamine imbalance dependency</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.910" end="00:51:41.619" style="s2">there there is a biological impact that</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.520" end="00:51:44.770" style="s2">I think a lot of people do not take into</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.619" end="00:51:46.359" style="s2">account but but you know to reply your</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.770" end="00:51:49.180" style="s2">initial question yeah I&#39;ll I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.359" end="00:51:51.609" style="s2">microdose occasionally with psilocybin I</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.180" end="00:51:53.380" style="s2">wrote a fiction book last year and I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.609" end="00:51:56.589" style="s2">write every Friday on a micro dose of</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.380" end="00:51:59.770" style="s2">LSD I will what something like this for</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.589" end="00:52:01.810" style="s2">you for LSD about 20 micrograms it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.770" end="00:52:03.609" style="s2">fairly large record I tend to have a</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.810" end="00:52:07.420" style="s2">high tolerance yeah and on a quarterly</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.609" end="00:52:09.820" style="s2">basis I will I will journey with my wife</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.420" end="00:52:12.580" style="s2">actually we we do couples therapy every</p>

<p begin="00:52:12.580" end="00:52:16.359" style="s2">variety of different Amazonian medicines</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.650" end="00:52:17.920" style="s2">there&#39;s always a great deal of</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.359" end="00:52:21.220" style="s2">preparation going in a great deal of</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.920" end="00:52:23.410" style="s2">integration going out and even then this</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.220" end="00:52:25.960" style="s2">is actually fresh on my mind because I</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.410" end="00:52:32.580" style="s2">have a journey coming up in in six days</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.960" end="00:52:34.810" style="s2">I take a vitamin C I take 5-htp I take</p>

<p begin="00:52:47.690" end="00:52:51.410" style="s2">going out with everything I know my</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.250" end="00:52:54.050" style="s2">neurotransmitters need to replete</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.410" end="00:52:57.410" style="s2">themselves you know dopo mucuna and more</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.050" end="00:53:00.410" style="s2">5-htp more vitamin C for the toxicity so</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.410" end="00:53:02.510" style="s2">there&#39;s a great deal that I do to reduce</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.410" end="00:53:05.360" style="s2">the biological impact that I know even a</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.510" end="00:53:07.190" style="s2">single journey can produce this is a DMT</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.360" end="00:53:10.010" style="s2">based journey or is this more of a</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.190" end="00:53:13.760" style="s2">mescaline this this would be similar to</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.010" end="00:53:15.830" style="s2">something like MDMA ayahuasca and</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.760" end="00:53:19.970" style="s2">psilocybin over the course of you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.830" end="00:53:21.350" style="s2">anywhere from 10 to 20 hours and the</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.970" end="00:53:24.050" style="s2">eyes it would be isolating though</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.350" end="00:53:25.700" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t it well you it&#39;s it&#39;s a similar</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.050" end="00:53:28.490" style="s2">feeling it&#39;s not a iwasa that&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.700" end="00:53:30.230" style="s2">used it&#39;s it&#39;s actually the person who</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.490" end="00:53:32.060" style="s2">facilitates this for me they&#39;re using a</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.230" end="00:53:34.220" style="s2">series of injections and pills that</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.060" end="00:53:36.320" style="s2">because of legal reasons they actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.220" end="00:53:37.700" style="s2">won&#39;t tell me what they&#39;re using but I</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.320" end="00:53:39.140" style="s2">can tell you it&#39;s it&#39;s similar to the</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.700" end="00:53:42.020" style="s2">same type of feeling as you&#39;d get from</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.140" end="00:53:46.880" style="s2">something like five Meo combined with</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.020" end="00:53:50.450" style="s2">ayahuasca or MDMA or so five Meo is the</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.880" end="00:53:55.310" style="s2">extract isolated or does their Sonoran</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.450" end="00:53:56.630" style="s2">Desert toad yeah yeah but what concerns</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.310" end="00:53:58.340" style="s2">me are the people doing their 38th</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.630" end="00:54:00.710" style="s2">ayahuasca treat in some New York City</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.340" end="00:54:02.690" style="s2">loft with their personal shaman and just</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.710" end="00:54:04.280" style="s2">completely abusing you know in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.690" end="00:54:05.720" style="s2">frequency of these things and not taking</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.280" end="00:54:09.290" style="s2">them as seriously as they should what do</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.720" end="00:54:10.400" style="s2">we do about explaining quickly to the</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.290" end="00:54:12.380" style="s2">government that it&#39;s in everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.400" end="00:54:15.620" style="s2">interest to stop bullshitting about</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.380" end="00:54:18.200" style="s2">schedule one designation and to start</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.620" end="00:54:20.870" style="s2">talking about really coming up with some</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.200" end="00:54:23.510" style="s2">regulation that is beneficial that</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.870" end="00:54:28.040" style="s2">recognizes the health benefits it seems</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.510" end="00:54:30.260" style="s2">to me that we&#39;ve got sort of a wrong new</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.040" end="00:54:32.600" style="s2">culture in place around the abuse of</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.260" end="00:54:34.610" style="s2">these things to compensate for the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.600" end="00:54:36.380" style="s2">culture that we have at a legal level I</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.610" end="00:54:37.850" style="s2">think Johns Hopkins and the Maps</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.380" end="00:54:39.680" style="s2">foundation they&#39;re beginning to roll out</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.850" end="00:54:40.580" style="s2">good research that that&#39;s actually being</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.680" end="00:54:42.350" style="s2">paid attention to</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.580" end="00:54:44.960" style="s2">I think academic institutions are doing</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.350" end="00:54:47.420" style="s2">good service for that I think that the</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.960" end="00:54:49.190" style="s2">implementation of physician is resident</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.420" end="00:54:51.470" style="s2">why you at the same time right NYU</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.190" end="00:54:54.320" style="s2">physician-assisted PTSD and trauma</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.470" end="00:54:54.980" style="s2">clinics that are using ketamine or or</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.320" end="00:54:56.869" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.980" end="00:54:59.240" style="s2">imagine pretty soon we&#39;ll be psilocybin</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.869" end="00:55:01.369" style="s2">under physicians supervise protocols</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.240" end="00:55:02.960" style="s2">with proper integration and and proper</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.369" end="00:55:05.359" style="s2">medical management going in and going</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.960" end="00:55:06.920" style="s2">out I think that that will will be</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.359" end="00:55:08.510" style="s2">something that we see with increasing</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.920" end="00:55:10.609" style="s2">frequency you know actual physician</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.510" end="00:55:12.890" style="s2">overseen clinics I would think that</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.609" end="00:55:17.630" style="s2">there&#39;s an aspect where we&#39;re expecting</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.890" end="00:55:20.300" style="s2">the physician to step into the role that</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.630" end="00:55:22.910" style="s2">a shaman previously inhabited and that</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.300" end="00:55:25.580" style="s2">may be physicians aren&#39;t really they may</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.910" end="00:55:29.230" style="s2">be more medically skilled but that a lot</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.580" end="00:55:31.400" style="s2">of the impact is not at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.230" end="00:55:33.650" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a need for physician</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.400" end="00:55:36.770" style="s2">education programs absolutely I know</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.650" end="00:55:40.550" style="s2">that a field trip which I think is</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.770" end="00:55:42.140" style="s2">rolling out in Toronto LA in New York</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.550" end="00:55:43.910" style="s2">over the next year they&#39;re combining</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.140" end="00:55:45.950" style="s2">like physician education programs with</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.910" end="00:55:48.080" style="s2">physician clinics for things like PTSD</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.950" end="00:55:50.630" style="s2">and trauma using plant medicines or</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.080" end="00:55:52.130" style="s2">using ketamine but yeah I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.630" end="00:55:55.100" style="s2">gonna see this strange kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.130" end="00:55:58.090" style="s2">hybrid physician shaman type of model</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.100" end="00:56:00.980" style="s2">where folks are actually educated in</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.090" end="00:56:02.930" style="s2">clinical management medically educated</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.980" end="00:56:05.000" style="s2">but also have a working knowledge of</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.930" end="00:56:07.520" style="s2">things like Amazonian medicines and you</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.000" end="00:56:10.430" style="s2">know integration and you know sila Tate</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.520" end="00:56:12.619" style="s2">as well I think the music is huge and I</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.430" end="00:56:14.420" style="s2">think that when you look at you know I</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.619" end="00:56:16.160" style="s2">was even toying around some apps because</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.420" end="00:56:18.619" style="s2">I love to play handpan and guitar and</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.160" end="00:56:20.660" style="s2">ukulele and there are cymatics apps that</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.619" end="00:56:23.390" style="s2">you can download that will translate the</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.660" end="00:56:26.660" style="s2">music into recognizable geometric</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.390" end="00:56:28.640" style="s2">patterns and I think that the use of</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.660" end="00:56:31.580" style="s2">music in conjunction with some of these</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.640" end="00:56:33.859" style="s2">therapies can elicit almost like a</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.580" end="00:56:36.170" style="s2">vibratory response within the cell</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.859" end="00:56:38.359" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s based on a response to</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.170" end="00:56:41.060" style="s2">these sound frequencies that can enhance</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.359" end="00:56:42.440" style="s2">a journey or take another stay cell you</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.060" end="00:56:43.850" style="s2">really think there&#39;s like a cellular</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.440" end="00:56:46.490" style="s2">level that means I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.850" end="00:56:48.740" style="s2">cellular level and and I&#39;m not speaking</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.490" end="00:56:51.290" style="s2">based on science or research or anything</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.740" end="00:56:53.960" style="s2">like that but I suspect that we are</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.290" end="00:56:56.060" style="s2">actually impacting ourselves with sound</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.960" end="00:57:00.530" style="s2">frequencies and that these geometric</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.060" end="00:57:02.540" style="s2">patterns are that that we&#39;re seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.530" end="00:57:03.759" style="s2">you can visualize that music is</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.540" end="00:57:05.589" style="s2">producing and you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.759" end="00:57:07.959" style="s2">can app are actually occurring within</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.589" end="00:57:11.079" style="s2">our bodies as well if you look at these</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.959" end="00:57:14.919" style="s2">cantaloupe ends from the perspective of</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.079" end="00:57:16.749" style="s2">frequency analysis no but I can tell you</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.919" end="00:57:17.889" style="s2">that I feel amazing I have a hand pan</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.749" end="00:57:19.649" style="s2">that I&#39;m learning to play right now I</p>

<p begin="00:57:19.649" end="00:57:25.239" style="s2">they&#39;re impossible to sound poorly on</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.469" end="00:57:27.369" style="s2">because they&#39;re all tuned to a specific</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.239" end="00:57:29.109" style="s2">scale like mine is in a B scale well the</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.369" end="00:57:32.169" style="s2">second I can strike it anywhere and it</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.109" end="00:57:35.349" style="s2">sounds great and it&#39;s very calming I</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.169" end="00:57:37.209" style="s2">tried to look at this and my</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.349" end="00:57:41.709" style="s2">understanding is is that if you think</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.209" end="00:57:46.029" style="s2">about steel drums steel drums have that</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.709" end="00:57:48.069" style="s2">very muddy kind of sound and that with</p>

<p begin="00:57:49.839" end="00:57:53.019" style="s2">Switzerland mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.130" end="00:57:57.639" style="s2">the problem is that a two dimensional</p>

<p begin="00:57:57.639" end="00:58:01.689" style="s2">Discipline relative to a one-dimensional</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.499" end="00:58:04.149" style="s2">media so that if you think about a flute</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.689" end="00:58:05.409" style="s2">or if you think about a vibrating string</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.149" end="00:58:08.769" style="s2">that you would have let&#39;s say on a</p>

<p begin="00:58:08.769" end="00:58:13.689" style="s2">sort of line up in some well-defined</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.709" end="00:58:15.669" style="s2">fashion because of the one-dimensional</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.689" end="00:58:18.219" style="s2">nature of the medium that&#39;s vibrating</p>

<p begin="00:58:20.739" end="00:58:25.569" style="s2">was to figure out how to get enough</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.569" end="00:58:28.089" style="s2">precision to get the two-dimensional</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.569" end="00:58:30.249" style="s2">medium to sound at least for the first</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.089" end="00:58:33.849" style="s2">few harmonics as if it was a</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.249" end="00:58:35.619" style="s2">one-dimensional medium hmm I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.849" end="00:58:38.079" style="s2">if I exactly have that right but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.619" end="00:58:40.659" style="s2">why it&#39;s it&#39;s impossible to sound bad</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.079" end="00:58:42.669" style="s2">because you&#39;re hearing something that</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.659" end="00:58:44.829" style="s2">effectively would never be found in</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.669" end="00:58:46.749" style="s2">nature by just taking a metal plate and</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.829" end="00:58:48.309" style="s2">banging on it yeah that makes sense I</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.749" end="00:58:50.799" style="s2">was always under the impression that it</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.309" end="00:58:53.319" style="s2">was simply the the the the tuning of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.799" end="00:58:55.449" style="s2">instrument itself in that each place</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.319" end="00:58:56.739" style="s2">where you were you strike where each of</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.449" end="00:58:58.029" style="s2">the different locations for anyone</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.739" end="00:59:00.159" style="s2">listening who hasn&#39;t seen a hand pen</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.029" end="00:59:02.679" style="s2">usually there&#39;s eight or nine different</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.159" end="00:59:05.979" style="s2">locations that you strike it&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.679" end="00:59:07.659" style="s2">all tuned to the same scale and so look</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.979" end="00:59:08.949" style="s2">you may have a pentatonic scale or</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.659" end="00:59:10.809" style="s2">something like that where it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.949" end="00:59:12.549" style="s2">find a wrong note right</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.809" end="00:59:13.670" style="s2">you know tuned to the same route I guess</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.549" end="00:59:17.480" style="s2">I should say you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.670" end="00:59:20.180" style="s2">case B well I think you could turn to</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.480" end="00:59:21.950" style="s2">teddy yeah oh yeah you can you can see</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.180" end="00:59:23.839" style="s2">you can do it in 2d but when once you</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.950" end="00:59:25.309" style="s2">buy a pan it&#39;s yeah you&#39;re buying your</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.839" end="00:59:27.650" style="s2">hand that&#39;s tuned to a specific lens</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.309" end="00:59:29.839" style="s2">yeah and you can&#39;t play and sound good a</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.650" end="00:59:32.030" style="s2">pan that&#39;s tuned and B you know with</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.839" end="00:59:36.799" style="s2">someone who&#39;s got a pan tuned to to to</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.030" end="00:59:42.500" style="s2">see for example what can you leave my</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.799" end="00:59:45.200" style="s2">audience with as the best way for</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.500" end="00:59:46.549" style="s2">somebody who&#39;s not familiar with a lot</p>

<p begin="00:59:46.549" end="00:59:52.940" style="s2">concepts we&#39;ve discussed but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.760" end="00:59:55.430" style="s2">realizing that the processed food that</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.940" end="00:59:57.980" style="s2">they&#39;re eating might not be good for</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.430" end="01:00:01.240" style="s2">their lipid layers they know that their</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.980" end="01:00:04.400" style="s2">sleep is off their stress is too high</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.240" end="01:00:07.790" style="s2">they don&#39;t know enough about physiology</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.400" end="01:00:10.130" style="s2">anatomy to understand everything that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.790" end="01:00:12.619" style="s2">being said what is the best way of</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.130" end="01:00:15.710" style="s2">handing off from the show to somebody</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.619" end="01:00:18.470" style="s2">who wants to enter a kind of more</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.710" end="01:00:20.839" style="s2">mindful and intentional space and feels</p>

<p begin="01:00:20.839" end="01:00:27.520" style="s2">digest the information and confusing</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.410" end="01:00:29.299" style="s2">signals that are coming out of this I</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.520" end="01:00:35.210" style="s2">have two thoughts</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.299" end="01:00:36.859" style="s2">the first is be patient and wait when it</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.210" end="01:00:39.770" style="s2">comes to this self quantification piece</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.859" end="01:00:41.390" style="s2">because as we discussed I think we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.770" end="01:00:43.549" style="s2">an intermediate phase and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.390" end="01:00:45.140" style="s2">moving quickly and I don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.549" end="01:00:48.049" style="s2">the frustration and confusion is going</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.140" end="01:00:49.760" style="s2">to be around much longer as we roll out</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.049" end="01:00:51.680" style="s2">tools that allow for easier self</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.760" end="01:00:55.309" style="s2">quantification and interpretation of</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.680" end="01:01:01.160" style="s2">that data for now I would pay attention</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.309" end="01:01:04.010" style="s2">to eight things the first would be</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.160" end="01:01:05.990" style="s2">regardless of the exercise program just</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.010" end="01:01:07.819" style="s2">regular low level physical activity</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.990" end="01:01:10.400" style="s2">throughout the day we know this concept</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.819" end="01:01:12.589" style="s2">of NEET non-exercise activity</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.400" end="01:01:14.299" style="s2">thermogenesis regardless of whether you</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.589" end="01:01:16.880" style="s2">go to the gym just moving throughout the</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.299" end="01:01:19.940" style="s2">day as much as possible that that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.880" end="01:01:22.369" style="s2">first thing the second would be of all</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.940" end="01:01:25.160" style="s2">the diets that I&#39;ve seen out there in</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.369" end="01:01:27.150" style="s2">terms of good research I think one of</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.160" end="01:01:29.670" style="s2">the best ways to eat would be some</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.150" end="01:01:32.279" style="s2">of a relatively low carb Mediterranean</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.670" end="01:01:35.069" style="s2">diet I think that&#39;s the one that seems</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.279" end="01:01:36.980" style="s2">to be the best for most people because</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.069" end="01:01:38.819" style="s2">it controls glycemic variability</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.980" end="01:01:41.549" style="s2">introduces you to some elements of</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.819" end="01:01:46.619" style="s2">fasting has lots of herbs spices support</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.549" end="01:01:48.869" style="s2">of oils etc I would be out in sunlight</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.619" end="01:01:50.220" style="s2">frequently because we know that photons</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.869" end="01:01:52.349" style="s2">of light are very healing to the body</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.220" end="01:01:54.329" style="s2">and there&#39;s there&#39;s this amazing new</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.349" end="01:01:56.519" style="s2">concept of human photosynthesis and our</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.329" end="01:01:58.079" style="s2">ability to create electrons in ATP and</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.519" end="01:01:59.970" style="s2">response to photons of light I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.079" end="01:02:00.900" style="s2">immersed in a few books right now on</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.970" end="01:02:04.829" style="s2">that and it&#39;s it&#39;s absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.900" end="01:02:07.410" style="s2">fascinating in the same way I would be</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.829" end="01:02:10.259" style="s2">outside barefoot or touching the ground</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.410" end="01:02:12.509" style="s2">every day there&#39;s this great or this is</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.259" end="01:02:14.640" style="s2">still three this is four okay so we have</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.509" end="01:02:16.859" style="s2">low level physical activity we have some</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.640" end="01:02:18.569" style="s2">kind of a low carb Mediterranean type of</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.859" end="01:02:21.089" style="s2">eating approach exposure to sunlight</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.569" end="01:02:23.039" style="s2">being outside barefoot or in touch with</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.089" end="01:02:24.539" style="s2">the planet which allows for if you look</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.039" end="01:02:26.700" style="s2">into the research on earthing or</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.539" end="01:02:28.589" style="s2">grounding a great decrease in</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.700" end="01:02:30.420" style="s2">inflammation and improvement in a wide</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.589" end="01:02:32.519" style="s2">variety of health parameters you have</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.420" end="01:02:34.319" style="s2">fingered Vibram type these are not</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.519" end="01:02:36.210" style="s2">grounding shoes but but at going outside</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.319" end="01:02:40.200" style="s2">barefoot bare without big rubber soled</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.210" end="01:02:42.569" style="s2">shoes on um introduce heat and cold</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.200" end="01:02:44.819" style="s2">we know from finnish longevity studies</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.569" end="01:02:46.799" style="s2">for example that sweating or being hot</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.819" end="01:02:48.839" style="s2">on a frequent basis is very good for the</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.799" end="01:02:50.999" style="s2">body and we know that cold thermogenesis</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.839" end="01:02:52.349" style="s2">cryotherapy cold showers things like</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.999" end="01:02:54.509" style="s2">that are wonderful for things like</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.349" end="01:02:57.900" style="s2">weight stability nitric oxide production</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.509" end="01:02:59.819" style="s2">blood flow etc low level physical</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.900" end="01:03:01.950" style="s2">activity some kind of a low carb</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.819" end="01:03:05.160" style="s2">Mediterranean diet sunlight grounding</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.950" end="01:03:07.650" style="s2">earthing heat cold and then finally good</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.160" end="01:03:10.049" style="s2">clean water and minerals like a good</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.650" end="01:03:12.239" style="s2">salt good trace liquid mineral anything</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.049" end="01:03:14.339" style="s2">like that I would say that if you</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.239" end="01:03:17.279" style="s2">address those eight parameters the</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.339" end="01:03:18.779" style="s2">movement and the relatively ready to get</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.279" end="01:03:19.440" style="s2">eight a little bit let me see if I got</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.779" end="01:03:21.210" style="s2">it okay</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.440" end="01:03:23.220" style="s2">alright the low level of physical</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.210" end="01:03:25.019" style="s2">activity regardless of the exercise</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.220" end="01:03:29.249" style="s2">pretty garlis of the exercise program a</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.019" end="01:03:33.119" style="s2">low carb Mediterranean diet yes then</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.249" end="01:03:36.420" style="s2">there&#39;s going to be sunlight then being</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.119" end="01:03:38.970" style="s2">barefoot and alternating hot and cold</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.420" end="01:03:40.829" style="s2">regime and he went in cold would be five</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.970" end="01:03:42.930" style="s2">and six oh five and six okay</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.829" end="01:03:47.489" style="s2">didn&#39;t realize who they&#39;re yeah and then</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.930" end="01:03:49.650" style="s2">minerals and minerals and water minerals</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.489" end="01:03:52.319" style="s2">in water or seven and eight yeah okay</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.650" end="01:03:53.819" style="s2">now I got and largely and and I know</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.319" end="01:03:56.069" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re running a little short on</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.819" end="01:03:59.759" style="s2">time but largely the idea behind those</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.069" end="01:04:02.099" style="s2">latter six photons of light negative</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.759" end="01:04:04.289" style="s2">ions from the surface of the earth the</p>

<p begin="01:04:04.289" end="01:04:08.069" style="s2">and the carrying of electrons with water</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.359" end="01:04:10.859" style="s2">and minerals essentially treats the</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.069" end="01:04:12.420" style="s2">human body as a battery and because each</p>

<p begin="01:04:20.279" end="01:04:25.380" style="s2">earthing grounding heat cold water and</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.410" end="01:04:27.539" style="s2">minerals so that&#39;s where I&#39;d start all</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.380" end="01:04:29.459" style="s2">right this is pretty intense</p>
