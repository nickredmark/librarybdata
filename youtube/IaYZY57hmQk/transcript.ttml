<p begin="00:02:52.640" end="00:02:56.560" style="s2">start us off with the question</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.560" end="00:02:59.280" style="s2">um okay let&#39;s let&#39;s try to do that and</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.560" end="00:03:02.400" style="s2">if this doesn&#39;t work then i could</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.280" end="00:03:04.720" style="s2">great so okay um</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.400" end="00:03:08.319" style="s2">how do you see the family playing a role</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.720" end="00:03:08.319" style="s2">in installment practices</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.120" end="00:03:16.319" style="s2">uh the family is in fact perhaps the</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.720" end="00:03:19.920" style="s2">primary</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.319" end="00:03:24.080" style="s2">place where ensome and dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.920" end="00:03:24.080" style="s2">happen um so</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.879" end="00:03:31.599" style="s2">you know first place i go there is</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.480" end="00:03:32.000" style="s2">some of the kind of cosmology let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.599" end="00:03:33.360" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.000" end="00:03:36.080" style="s2">religious traditions like tibetan</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.360" end="00:03:38.879" style="s2">buddhism because there&#39;s a sense of like</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.080" end="00:03:40.000" style="s2">why was one born into a particular</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.879" end="00:03:42.959" style="s2">family</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.000" end="00:03:45.120" style="s2">rather than another family right this</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.959" end="00:03:47.519" style="s2">question of like</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.120" end="00:03:48.239" style="s2">you don&#39;t choose your parents is what it</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.519" end="00:03:49.599" style="s2">feels like</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.239" end="00:03:51.519" style="s2">and sometimes there&#39;s this question of</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.599" end="00:03:52.480" style="s2">like how did i get stuck with this</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.519" end="00:03:55.599" style="s2">family</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.480" end="00:03:57.760" style="s2">or thank god i got this family</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.599" end="00:03:59.120" style="s2">so this this basic notion of that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.760" end="00:04:02.239" style="s2">very first</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.120" end="00:04:05.360" style="s2">environment the soul</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.239" end="00:04:08.879" style="s2">is drawn into is the womb of</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.360" end="00:04:10.720" style="s2">a particular woman uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.879" end="00:04:12.640" style="s2">and so you know tibetan buddhism there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.720" end="00:04:15.760" style="s2">that notion of like well no</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.640" end="00:04:17.120" style="s2">you do choose your parents like you are</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.760" end="00:04:20.560" style="s2">in the bardo realm</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.120" end="00:04:23.759" style="s2">and you are trying to position yourself</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.560" end="00:04:26.560" style="s2">into a particular condition of insolvent</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.759" end="00:04:28.400" style="s2">for the next round right so you can</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.560" end="00:04:32.320" style="s2">believe that or not and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.400" end="00:04:35.919" style="s2">complex actually ontology required</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.320" end="00:04:38.560" style="s2">to uh to make that work but</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.919" end="00:04:39.840" style="s2">the the basic notion or the intuition</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.560" end="00:04:42.160" style="s2">there the image</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.840" end="00:04:43.360" style="s2">resonates right there is this sense that</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.160" end="00:04:46.639" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.360" end="00:04:50.000" style="s2">the family is the is the primary effect</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.639" end="00:04:52.320" style="s2">um and yet you don&#39;t choose it you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.000" end="00:04:54.479" style="s2">abraham maslow used to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.320" end="00:04:56.000" style="s2">uh you know there&#39;s the realm of</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.479" end="00:04:57.360" style="s2">deficiency which is like the lower</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.000" end="00:04:59.199" style="s2">levels and then there&#39;s this realm of</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.360" end="00:05:01.440" style="s2">being so there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.199" end="00:05:03.440" style="s2">in the realm of being beyond self</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.440" end="00:05:05.120" style="s2">actualization into self</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.440" end="00:05:06.960" style="s2">transcendence in the being realm there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.120" end="00:05:10.320" style="s2">like being values</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.960" end="00:05:13.199" style="s2">and there&#39;s also things like being</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.320" end="00:05:15.600" style="s2">injustice which is to say things that</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.199" end="00:05:17.919" style="s2">appear to be unfair</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.600" end="00:05:19.520" style="s2">just by virtue of the nature of reality</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.919" end="00:05:21.520" style="s2">so like sometimes it feels this way when</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.520" end="00:05:25.360" style="s2">you&#39;re born into a particular family</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.520" end="00:05:28.800" style="s2">right uh like when uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.360" end="00:05:32.639" style="s2">when a child um is born into</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.800" end="00:05:35.440" style="s2">you know unbelievable poverty and</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.639" end="00:05:38.080" style="s2">uh conditions of oppression and abuse</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.440" end="00:05:40.000" style="s2">there&#39;s this question of like well you</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.080" end="00:05:41.919" style="s2">know in some sense that&#39;s a social</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.000" end="00:05:43.520" style="s2">injustice because of the economic system</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.919" end="00:05:45.199" style="s2">and other dynamics but there&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.520" end="00:05:48.720" style="s2">way in which</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.199" end="00:05:52.240" style="s2">you know that soul landed in that family</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.720" end="00:05:54.479" style="s2">and how what to make of that so this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.240" end="00:05:56.639" style="s2">a very deep question</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.479" end="00:05:59.039" style="s2">so the first answer is that is that the</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.639" end="00:06:01.600" style="s2">in the early years of your life</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.039" end="00:06:04.000" style="s2">the main theater in which installment</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.600" end="00:06:07.199" style="s2">takes place as the family</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.000" end="00:06:08.960" style="s2">and then most of the primary images</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.199" end="00:06:11.039" style="s2">of self so you have to think about the</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.960" end="00:06:13.199" style="s2">image of self as kind of like a</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.039" end="00:06:14.240" style="s2">schema in a piagetian sense where</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.199" end="00:06:16.400" style="s2">there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.240" end="00:06:17.919" style="s2">it places you in relation to other</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.400" end="00:06:19.680" style="s2">people who are modeled a certain way in</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.919" end="00:06:21.280" style="s2">relation to the world which is modeled a</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.680" end="00:06:23.680" style="s2">certain way so there&#39;s this image this</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.280" end="00:06:27.280" style="s2">deep image and the imagination</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.680" end="00:06:30.240" style="s2">pre-conscious usually of the cell</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.280" end="00:06:30.880" style="s2">and uh those first images of the self</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.240" end="00:06:34.880" style="s2">emerge</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.880" end="00:06:37.680" style="s2">from the family system very directly</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.880" end="00:06:40.000" style="s2">and those primary images of stuff which</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.680" end="00:06:43.120" style="s2">emerge in the early years</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.000" end="00:06:45.840" style="s2">are the things that linger on</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.120" end="00:06:46.800" style="s2">and structure the rest of the downscreen</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.840" end="00:06:50.240" style="s2">downstream</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.800" end="00:06:52.240" style="s2">schemas so this is a pretty classic</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.240" end="00:06:54.560" style="s2">way of thinking about it so i think</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.240" end="00:06:57.919" style="s2">something like that is also true that</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.560" end="00:07:01.360" style="s2">even after you have left your family</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.919" end="00:07:03.919" style="s2">let&#39;s say your family of origin and</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.360" end="00:07:05.120" style="s2">you know you&#39;re a grown person and</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.919" end="00:07:08.080" style="s2">you&#39;ve worked with</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.120" end="00:07:09.759" style="s2">trauma you&#39;ve inherited and you&#39;ve you</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.080" end="00:07:12.720" style="s2">know deconstructed all the</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.759" end="00:07:14.160" style="s2">simple notions uh that you were given</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.720" end="00:07:15.280" style="s2">around the dinner table and all these</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.160" end="00:07:17.919" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.280" end="00:07:18.720" style="s2">the family is still in there as a deep</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.919" end="00:07:23.680" style="s2">rooted</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.720" end="00:07:26.080" style="s2">often pre-conscious image of self</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.680" end="00:07:26.800" style="s2">so what that means is usually there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.080" end="00:07:29.520" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.800" end="00:07:30.479" style="s2">that one goes from being brought into a</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.520" end="00:07:33.199" style="s2">family</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.479" end="00:07:34.639" style="s2">let&#39;s say without choosing it to then</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.199" end="00:07:38.800" style="s2">choosing to create</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.639" end="00:07:41.120" style="s2">new forms of family</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.800" end="00:07:42.720" style="s2">so that&#39;s the that&#39;s the other dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.120" end="00:07:45.599" style="s2">to note here is that</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.720" end="00:07:47.599" style="s2">there&#39;s the conditions of insolent which</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.599" end="00:07:49.360" style="s2">are not up to you</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.599" end="00:07:51.599" style="s2">and then there are the conditions of</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.360" end="00:07:54.240" style="s2">installment which you create</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.599" end="00:07:55.440" style="s2">through action right so when you turn</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.240" end="00:07:56.960" style="s2">the whole loop</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.440" end="00:07:58.720" style="s2">and you move through the transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.960" end="00:08:02.160" style="s2">and through choice you can</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.720" end="00:08:05.199" style="s2">be in a situation where you actually are</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.160" end="00:08:06.639" style="s2">making choices that affect the condition</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.199" end="00:08:08.319" style="s2">of your installment and one of those</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.639" end="00:08:11.440" style="s2">choices is things like</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.319" end="00:08:12.720" style="s2">marriage children the other dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.440" end="00:08:15.919" style="s2">that draw you into</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.720" end="00:08:17.360" style="s2">deep interpersonal relationship and as i</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.919" end="00:08:19.759" style="s2">was saying last time in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.360" end="00:08:20.639" style="s2">question about polyamory like</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.759" end="00:08:24.879" style="s2">commitments</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.639" end="00:08:28.800" style="s2">to others until you die</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.879" end="00:08:31.280" style="s2">like all in for this life</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.800" end="00:08:32.240" style="s2">uh these are very real commitments that</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.280" end="00:08:34.880" style="s2">humans have</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.240" end="00:08:36.640" style="s2">i mean this is this is as real as like</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.880" end="00:08:40.240" style="s2">gravity</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.640" end="00:08:43.360" style="s2">in terms of the nature that the the the</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.240" end="00:08:44.720" style="s2">the way the mind must adapt to the</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.360" end="00:08:46.959" style="s2">immovable reality</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.720" end="00:08:49.920" style="s2">of those kinds of social commitments</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.959" end="00:08:54.720" style="s2">that you love i.e family</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.920" end="00:08:58.720" style="s2">and so so that&#39;s just that the more</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.720" end="00:09:00.399" style="s2">intense you can create the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.720" end="00:09:02.240" style="s2">family and it doesn&#39;t need to be in like</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.399" end="00:09:04.480" style="s2">a a simple</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.240" end="00:09:06.160" style="s2">kind of capitalist atomic family sense</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.480" end="00:09:08.240" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t need to be in like a</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.160" end="00:09:09.279" style="s2">ethnocentric like it&#39;s the family like</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.240" end="00:09:12.480" style="s2">the italian mob</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.279" end="00:09:15.600" style="s2">but this notion of like action</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.480" end="00:09:16.160" style="s2">deep connection uh which through your</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.600" end="00:09:18.320" style="s2">choice</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.160" end="00:09:20.320" style="s2">eventually as you mature you create the</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.320" end="00:09:22.560" style="s2">conditions of your installment</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.320" end="00:09:24.000" style="s2">by creating the family and then of</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.560" end="00:09:24.880" style="s2">course if the family involves having</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.000" end="00:09:26.399" style="s2">children</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.880" end="00:09:28.080" style="s2">then you&#39;re also creating the conditions</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.399" end="00:09:29.920" style="s2">for the installment of the child who</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.080" end="00:09:34.720" style="s2">comes into that family</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.920" end="00:09:37.519" style="s2">um and uh so yeah so family is a root</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.720" end="00:09:38.480" style="s2">and in fact when you look at uh john</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.519" end="00:09:41.519" style="s2">rawls&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.480" end="00:09:45.200" style="s2">is uh um</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.519" end="00:09:48.160" style="s2">uh the fiercest of uh social justice</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.200" end="00:09:51.920" style="s2">that i did my dissertation work on</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.160" end="00:09:54.080" style="s2">brilliant social theorist he places uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.920" end="00:09:55.680" style="s2">education schooling everything to do</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.080" end="00:09:58.959" style="s2">with that dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.680" end="00:10:00.080" style="s2">uh in family he basically says like you</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.959" end="00:10:01.519" style="s2">know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.080" end="00:10:04.079" style="s2">the state there&#39;s the market and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.519" end="00:10:06.880" style="s2">the family something like that</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.079" end="00:10:08.399" style="s2">and within the family is all of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.880" end="00:10:09.519" style="s2">dynamics of intergenerational</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.399" end="00:10:14.000" style="s2">transmission</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.519" end="00:10:16.800" style="s2">um so in a sense you can extend the</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.000" end="00:10:19.920" style="s2">notion of family beyond</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.800" end="00:10:22.399" style="s2">even the blood connection</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.920" end="00:10:23.680" style="s2">and even the small locality and you can</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.399" end="00:10:27.120" style="s2">start thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.680" end="00:10:30.880" style="s2">the human family or the</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.120" end="00:10:32.720" style="s2">community as a family so the more that</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.880" end="00:10:34.640" style="s2">the social system and the civilization</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.720" end="00:10:37.839" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.640" end="00:10:40.880" style="s2">has large pockets of that familial</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.839" end="00:10:44.000" style="s2">soul root connection</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.880" end="00:10:47.360" style="s2">then the more education becomes</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.000" end="00:10:49.279" style="s2">education becomes a very rich dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.360" end="00:10:51.120" style="s2">um as opposed to a superficial</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.279" end="00:10:54.000" style="s2">institutionalized dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.120" end="00:10:55.519" style="s2">uh so yeah so there&#39;s i think a lot to</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.000" end="00:10:57.760" style="s2">say there you opened a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.519" end="00:10:59.200" style="s2">pretty big door maybe like a double door</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.760" end="00:11:02.399" style="s2">when you ask about the family</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.200" end="00:11:03.440" style="s2">and and insult and it&#39;s no coincidence</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.399" end="00:11:05.120" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.440" end="00:11:07.920" style="s2">when you look at psychology and</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.120" end="00:11:10.959" style="s2">especially depth psychology</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.920" end="00:11:12.640" style="s2">you end up thinking a ton about the</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.959" end="00:11:16.160" style="s2">family developmental psychology</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.640" end="00:11:18.480" style="s2">similar bronfenbrenner et cetera so</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.160" end="00:11:19.519" style="s2">excellent thank you we&#39;ll move on we can</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.480" end="00:11:21.600" style="s2">deepen that line</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.519" end="00:11:23.519" style="s2">with the family or we can totally change</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.600" end="00:11:25.040" style="s2">course so i&#39;m in your hands</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.519" end="00:11:27.120" style="s2">how&#39;s the audio though is it coming</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.040" end="00:11:30.480" style="s2">through okay audio is perfect</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.120" end="00:11:33.600" style="s2">okay excellent so we&#39;ll jump to a</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.480" end="00:11:33.600" style="s2">question from engine</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.079" end="00:11:40.560" style="s2">hey zach um i&#39;m not sure if i&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.360" end="00:11:43.680" style="s2">the practicum</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.560" end="00:11:46.800" style="s2">properly but my question is how could</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.680" end="00:11:50.160" style="s2">like perfectionism</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.800" end="00:11:50.959" style="s2">and procrastination um be better</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.160" end="00:11:53.760" style="s2">understood</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.959" end="00:11:57.120" style="s2">and potentially helped from eating a</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.760" end="00:12:00.079" style="s2">metapsych lens</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.120" end="00:12:00.800" style="s2">awesome yeah so this is exactly the kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.079" end="00:12:03.120" style="s2">of practical</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.800" end="00:12:04.240" style="s2">question because i&#39;ve not asked myself</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.120" end="00:12:07.200" style="s2">that question</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.240" end="00:12:08.839" style="s2">about the metapsychology so this is me</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.200" end="00:12:10.079" style="s2">improvising with the tools of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.839" end="00:12:12.079" style="s2">metapsychology</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.079" end="00:12:13.680" style="s2">trying to handle a very common</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.079" end="00:12:17.040" style="s2">psychological</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.680" end="00:12:19.200" style="s2">uh dynamic uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.040" end="00:12:20.880" style="s2">and so you mentioned perfectionism and</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.200" end="00:12:21.680" style="s2">procrastination so i&#39;m gonna ask you a</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.880" end="00:12:23.279" style="s2">couple questions</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.680" end="00:12:25.200" style="s2">just make sure i&#39;m answering your</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.279" end="00:12:27.519" style="s2">question well so you so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.200" end="00:12:28.959" style="s2">tying procrastination and perfectionism</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.519" end="00:12:30.240" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.959" end="00:12:31.519" style="s2">because there are definitely people who</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.240" end="00:12:32.560" style="s2">are non-perfectionists who also</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.519" end="00:12:34.800" style="s2">procrastinate</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.560" end="00:12:36.480" style="s2">so you&#39;re looking at a particular kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.800" end="00:12:37.440" style="s2">of procrastination so maybe you could</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.480" end="00:12:40.160" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.440" end="00:12:40.160" style="s2">more about that</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.800" end="00:12:44.959" style="s2">i think they&#39;re tied together in my life</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.800" end="00:12:45.600" style="s2">um i don&#39;t think you need to answer it</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.959" end="00:12:48.959" style="s2">it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.600" end="00:12:51.360" style="s2">specifically to that</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.959" end="00:12:53.680" style="s2">but i&#39;d be happy to the more specific we</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.360" end="00:12:56.720" style="s2">get the more it actually is a real</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.680" end="00:12:58.079" style="s2">thing and not a theoretical exercise</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.720" end="00:13:00.160" style="s2">so if you don&#39;t want to be the focus of</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.079" end="00:13:00.959" style="s2">attention i can certainly take it to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.160" end="00:13:03.040" style="s2">abstract</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.959" end="00:13:04.000" style="s2">but if you want to describe a situation</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.040" end="00:13:06.480" style="s2">maybe</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.000" end="00:13:07.839" style="s2">in your lived experience where this</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.480" end="00:13:11.600" style="s2">dynamic shows up</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.839" end="00:13:11.600" style="s2">and then we can kind of dig in</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.200" end="00:13:18.839" style="s2">it&#39;s a silly example good most</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.480" end="00:13:20.320" style="s2">most of the psyche is actually pretty</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.839" end="00:13:24.639" style="s2">silly</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.320" end="00:13:28.240" style="s2">like i basically just run my life by</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.639" end="00:13:30.240" style="s2">what&#39;s urgent um i feel like</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.240" end="00:13:31.600" style="s2">i used to joke in school oh if stuff</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.240" end="00:13:32.560" style="s2">didn&#39;t have deadlines like nothing would</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.600" end="00:13:34.959" style="s2">get done</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.560" end="00:13:36.399" style="s2">and in the real world i i work for</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.959" end="00:13:38.880" style="s2">myself and like [ __ ] there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.399" end="00:13:38.880" style="s2">deadlines</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.959" end="00:13:44.000" style="s2">and so it&#39;s kind of manufacturing crises</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.360" end="00:13:46.160" style="s2">and just</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.000" end="00:13:47.760" style="s2">focusing on what&#39;s urgent so i thought</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.160" end="00:13:50.959" style="s2">there&#39;s this great need</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.760" end="00:13:52.399" style="s2">to have some sort of to-do list or</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.959" end="00:13:53.680" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.399" end="00:13:55.040" style="s2">such that you could actually work on</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.680" end="00:13:57.360" style="s2">what&#39;s important but not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.040" end="00:13:57.360" style="s2">urgent</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.519" end="00:14:01.279" style="s2">but it&#39;s been literally like six months</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.360" end="00:14:03.120" style="s2">and i still have not picked a to-do list</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.279" end="00:14:06.480" style="s2">because it seems like such a</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.120" end="00:14:09.120" style="s2">an important thing and i&#39;m notoriously</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.480" end="00:14:11.040" style="s2">picky or finicky when it comes to this</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.120" end="00:14:14.000" style="s2">and so like i&#39;ve read like</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.040" end="00:14:16.560" style="s2">so many reviews and learned what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.000" end="00:14:18.399" style="s2">best and read all of this and every time</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.560" end="00:14:20.399" style="s2">i have to pick it i just kind of put it</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.399" end="00:14:22.720" style="s2">off</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.399" end="00:14:22.720" style="s2">all right</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.120" end="00:14:31.839" style="s2">yeah totally um so</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.320" end="00:14:31.839" style="s2">a few things i&#39;ll mention here so</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.160" end="00:14:36.240" style="s2">i think i saw a lot of heads nodding my</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.560" end="00:14:40.079" style="s2">head my head was nodding</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.240" end="00:14:43.279" style="s2">like a lot of people are now in</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.079" end="00:14:45.519" style="s2">uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.279" end="00:14:48.519" style="s2">not traditionally institution</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.519" end="00:14:51.279" style="s2">institutionalized or completely</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.519" end="00:14:54.079" style="s2">non-institutionalized work contexts</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.279" end="00:14:55.600" style="s2">all right so that&#39;s worth noting and</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.079" end="00:14:57.600" style="s2">most of us weren&#39;t prepared for that</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.600" end="00:14:59.279" style="s2">because we went to these really</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.600" end="00:15:00.639" style="s2">complicated institutions that were</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.279" end="00:15:02.160" style="s2">pretty well run which were called</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.639" end="00:15:04.959" style="s2">schools</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.160" end="00:15:06.480" style="s2">so we were like trained to have</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.959" end="00:15:09.600" style="s2">45-minute blocks</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.480" end="00:15:11.360" style="s2">of focus where someone sat us down and</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.600" end="00:15:13.760" style="s2">made us do stuff</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.360" end="00:15:14.959" style="s2">and then did that for years and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.760" end="00:15:16.079" style="s2">even through college</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.959" end="00:15:18.880" style="s2">especially if you&#39;re like a quote</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.079" end="00:15:20.240" style="s2">unquote good student um</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.880" end="00:15:21.760" style="s2">you kind of played by those</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.240" end="00:15:22.320" style="s2">institutional rules and then you&#39;re set</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.760" end="00:15:27.360" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.320" end="00:15:29.920" style="s2">an economic context uh where</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.360" end="00:15:31.600" style="s2">it&#39;s completely different and so i just</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.920" end="00:15:33.440" style="s2">want to note the meta issue here</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.600" end="00:15:35.519" style="s2">which is that and you brought it into</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.440" end="00:15:36.959" style="s2">the room which is that like</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.519" end="00:15:38.639" style="s2">you know the conditions of schooling and</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.959" end="00:15:40.639" style="s2">the conditions of work</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.639" end="00:15:41.920" style="s2">uh for many people are completely</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.639" end="00:15:44.240" style="s2">different these days</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.920" end="00:15:46.560" style="s2">um and the schools have not caught up</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.240" end="00:15:48.959" style="s2">right so to prepare you to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.560" end="00:15:49.600" style="s2">working for yourself in this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.959" end="00:15:53.600" style="s2">like gig</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.600" end="00:15:56.560" style="s2">economy kind of like entrepreneurial um</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.600" end="00:15:57.680" style="s2">kind of post-post-modern service</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.560" end="00:16:00.160" style="s2">industry like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.680" end="00:16:00.880" style="s2">a crazy diverse economic landscape in</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.160" end="00:16:03.920" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.880" end="00:16:06.240" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing like uh</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.920" end="00:16:07.600" style="s2">the routines and schedules and</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.240" end="00:16:11.120" style="s2">disciplines of schooling</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.600" end="00:16:13.040" style="s2">to be found so so there&#39;s a certain</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.120" end="00:16:15.360" style="s2">thing that i call the habit body</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.040" end="00:16:16.800" style="s2">right and the habit body is literally</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.360" end="00:16:19.360" style="s2">the the way you</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.800" end="00:16:21.040" style="s2">sit and the movements you make with your</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.360" end="00:16:23.759" style="s2">hands when you talk</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.040" end="00:16:25.120" style="s2">and the disposition to get up and get a</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.759" end="00:16:26.720" style="s2">drink and the disposition to go to the</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.120" end="00:16:30.399" style="s2">bathroom at certain times</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.720" end="00:16:33.440" style="s2">so it&#39;s like really this embodied habit</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.399" end="00:16:37.120" style="s2">uh set and</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.440" end="00:16:40.000" style="s2">it kind of like down propagates from</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.120" end="00:16:40.399" style="s2">the other more explicit cognitive and</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.000" end="00:16:42.639" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.399" end="00:16:43.680" style="s2">reflective cognitive functions into the</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.639" end="00:16:45.279" style="s2">body</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.680" end="00:16:46.560" style="s2">so the first place that with these</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.279" end="00:16:48.399" style="s2">because this is an issue of habit body</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.560" end="00:16:51.120" style="s2">which is that you&#39;ve built up</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.399" end="00:16:51.920" style="s2">over many years uh a certain disposition</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.120" end="00:16:54.480" style="s2">towards</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.920" end="00:16:55.360" style="s2">extrinsic motivation in institutional</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.480" end="00:16:57.120" style="s2">contexts</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.360" end="00:17:00.000" style="s2">right which is what you said like if</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.120" end="00:17:02.160" style="s2">there&#39;s no deadline it won&#39;t get done</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.000" end="00:17:03.600" style="s2">and i&#39;m not super interested in it</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.160" end="00:17:04.160" style="s2">because if i was super interested in it</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.600" end="00:17:07.360" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.160" end="00:17:08.720" style="s2">i would do it so it&#39;s also extrinsically</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.360" end="00:17:09.839" style="s2">motivated there are certain things in</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.720" end="00:17:11.199" style="s2">your life which you&#39;re not mentioning</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.839" end="00:17:12.400" style="s2">which you do</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.199" end="00:17:14.799" style="s2">probably really well and really</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.400" end="00:17:16.799" style="s2">effectively um</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.799" end="00:17:18.240" style="s2">on a pretty consistent basis because</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.799" end="00:17:18.880" style="s2">they&#39;re things that either you need to</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.240" end="00:17:20.720" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.880" end="00:17:22.000" style="s2">or the things that you&#39;re super</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.720" end="00:17:24.400" style="s2">passionate about</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.000" end="00:17:25.280" style="s2">that you can&#39;t not do some of them could</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.400" end="00:17:28.319" style="s2">be friendships</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.280" end="00:17:31.200" style="s2">uh they could be other aspects</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.319" end="00:17:31.600" style="s2">so the first recommendation is actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.200" end="00:17:34.640" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.600" end="00:17:35.600" style="s2">think at the level of the habit body and</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.640" end="00:17:38.640" style="s2">so this is about</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.600" end="00:17:41.840" style="s2">actually changing</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.640" end="00:17:44.320" style="s2">the nature of your physical routine</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.840" end="00:17:45.919" style="s2">like changing the nature of chairs</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.320" end="00:17:47.360" style="s2">changing the nature of bedtimes and</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.919" end="00:17:49.280" style="s2">wake-up times</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.360" end="00:17:51.520" style="s2">uh changing the nature of meditation</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.280" end="00:17:55.520" style="s2">postures or</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.520" end="00:17:58.240" style="s2">thus rhythms and disciplines of work</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.520" end="00:17:59.440" style="s2">so some people find it necessary to</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.240" end="00:18:01.280" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.440" end="00:18:03.520" style="s2">get like a little studio or someplace</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.280" end="00:18:06.240" style="s2">that they can go to rent a simple room</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.520" end="00:18:08.160" style="s2">to do their work in because they need to</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.240" end="00:18:11.600" style="s2">commute</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.160" end="00:18:13.520" style="s2">and leave their space of living</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.600" end="00:18:14.640" style="s2">so and i&#39;m not going to prescribe one to</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.520" end="00:18:17.039" style="s2">you because i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.640" end="00:18:18.640" style="s2">your habit body so instead of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.039" end="00:18:19.840" style="s2">of it like something you need to do in</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.640" end="00:18:22.160" style="s2">the realm of</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.840" end="00:18:24.720" style="s2">thinking and cognitive operations and</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.160" end="00:18:27.600" style="s2">like script rewriting or something</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.720" end="00:18:29.760" style="s2">i think about it at some of you need to</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.600" end="00:18:33.360" style="s2">do at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.760" end="00:18:33.360" style="s2">changing embodied</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.440" end="00:18:38.799" style="s2">so that&#39;s the first one and the second</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.760" end="00:18:42.000" style="s2">one that</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.799" end="00:18:45.120" style="s2">uh you know that and this moves up</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.000" end="00:18:47.840" style="s2">out of the out of the body into into the</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.120" end="00:18:49.600" style="s2">more mental realm but you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.840" end="00:18:51.440" style="s2">motivation is very tricky</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.600" end="00:18:52.960" style="s2">motivation is not in the domain of</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.440" end="00:18:54.160" style="s2">development and</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.960" end="00:18:55.840" style="s2">it&#39;s actually not in the domain of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.160" end="00:18:57.039" style="s2">transcendent either because in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.840" end="00:18:57.520" style="s2">transcendent everything&#39;s perfect</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.039" end="00:19:00.480" style="s2">already</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.520" end="00:19:02.480" style="s2">basically always already so a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.480" end="00:19:05.760" style="s2">what we consider to be motivation</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.480" end="00:19:07.520" style="s2">is in this realm of the realm of</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.760" end="00:19:10.559" style="s2">installment</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.520" end="00:19:11.200" style="s2">and i think this was mentioned in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.559" end="00:19:14.480" style="s2">last</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.200" end="00:19:18.480" style="s2">one or basically that you</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.480" end="00:19:22.400" style="s2">you have to hit on the deepest</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.480" end="00:19:24.799" style="s2">aspects of character and personality</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.400" end="00:19:26.480" style="s2">before you can do any real skill</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.799" end="00:19:28.240" style="s2">development and capacity development and</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.480" end="00:19:31.360" style="s2">productivity and work</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.240" end="00:19:33.600" style="s2">so most of the time what i see in like</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.360" end="00:19:35.919" style="s2">attention deficit disorder</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.600" end="00:19:37.760" style="s2">and kids who are underperforming in</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.919" end="00:19:39.840" style="s2">school and these kinds of things is</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.760" end="00:19:41.520" style="s2">mostly is that</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.840" end="00:19:43.120" style="s2">you know they&#39;re actually pretty</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.520" end="00:19:43.760" style="s2">reflective on the context that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.120" end="00:19:45.280" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.760" end="00:19:46.880" style="s2">and they have pretty good reasons for</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.280" end="00:19:49.919" style="s2">not giving a [ __ ]</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.880" end="00:19:52.640" style="s2">about the assignments so there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.919" end="00:19:55.840" style="s2">deep question of how can we attach</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.640" end="00:19:57.600" style="s2">the dynamics of insolvent to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.840" end="00:19:58.880" style="s2">capacity development and productivity</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.600" end="00:20:02.240" style="s2">that happens in</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.880" end="00:20:04.880" style="s2">development so that&#39;s like the trick and</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.240" end="00:20:06.400" style="s2">how to attach the intrinsically</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.880" end="00:20:09.600" style="s2">motivating</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.400" end="00:20:12.080" style="s2">work to that work which</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.600" end="00:20:13.600" style="s2">quote unquote needs to be done by which</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.080" end="00:20:15.280" style="s2">institution you&#39;re in or</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.600" end="00:20:17.120" style="s2">the need to make money and things of</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.280" end="00:20:18.640" style="s2">that nature uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.120" end="00:20:20.320" style="s2">so that&#39;s the second bit you know work</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.640" end="00:20:21.840" style="s2">in the habit body that&#39;s good change</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.320" end="00:20:24.960" style="s2">that that helps a lot</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.840" end="00:20:27.360" style="s2">and then think about the</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.960" end="00:20:28.480" style="s2">think about what you&#39;re really doing</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.360" end="00:20:31.200" style="s2">with your time</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.480" end="00:20:32.320" style="s2">and the degree to which it resonates</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.200" end="00:20:35.679" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.320" end="00:20:38.320" style="s2">the images uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.679" end="00:20:39.520" style="s2">and imaginable landscapes that actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.320" end="00:20:42.799" style="s2">characterize</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.520" end="00:20:46.000" style="s2">who you think you are um</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.799" end="00:20:49.440" style="s2">and uh that is</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.000" end="00:20:52.720" style="s2">a difficult question to ask under some</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.440" end="00:20:56.080" style="s2">socioeconomic conditions because</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.720" end="00:20:57.360" style="s2">there&#39;s actually a duplicity or split</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.080" end="00:21:00.720" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.360" end="00:21:03.840" style="s2">between the deepest image</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.720" end="00:21:08.799" style="s2">and longings of</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.840" end="00:21:12.000" style="s2">the soul and the conditions of material</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.799" end="00:21:16.240" style="s2">embodiment development capacity</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.000" end="00:21:18.640" style="s2">and institutionalized context um</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.240" end="00:21:20.000" style="s2">so yeah so that&#39;s at another level this</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.640" end="00:21:21.120" style="s2">is kind of like saying</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.000" end="00:21:22.400" style="s2">you need to figure out what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.120" end="00:21:23.440" style="s2">really passionate about what you really</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.400" end="00:21:26.000" style="s2">want to do</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.440" end="00:21:26.880" style="s2">and then you&#39;ll do it if you can get the</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.000" end="00:21:29.679" style="s2">habit body</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.880" end="00:21:31.280" style="s2">set um but even if your habit body is</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.679" end="00:21:33.919" style="s2">really well locked in</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.280" end="00:21:35.840" style="s2">and you&#39;re not clear exactly what your</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.919" end="00:21:39.280" style="s2">quote-unquote dharma is</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.840" end="00:21:42.880" style="s2">uh you know what your unique gift</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.280" end="00:21:44.000" style="s2">to give is then there will always be</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.880" end="00:21:47.360" style="s2">these fluctuations</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.000" end="00:21:50.960" style="s2">of of motivation</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.360" end="00:21:52.880" style="s2">and that cascades down into the</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.960" end="00:21:54.400" style="s2">inability to focus and</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.880" end="00:21:57.679" style="s2">pay attention and specifically to</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.400" end="00:21:59.679" style="s2">prioritize correctly</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.679" end="00:22:00.799" style="s2">prioritizing is ultimately an exercise</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.679" end="00:22:04.159" style="s2">in values</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.799" end="00:22:06.720" style="s2">and um until you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.159" end="00:22:09.120" style="s2">who you are and what the image is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.720" end="00:22:11.840" style="s2">you&#39;re actualizing</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.120" end="00:22:12.480" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to know exactly what is most</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.840" end="00:22:15.520" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.480" end="00:22:16.960" style="s2">and valuable in the moment so so work on</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.520" end="00:22:19.440" style="s2">the habit body work on the</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.960" end="00:22:20.720" style="s2">clarification of self clarification of</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.440" end="00:22:23.600" style="s2">self image</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.720" end="00:22:23.919" style="s2">those would be my two recommendations</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.600" end="00:22:27.520" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.919" end="00:22:30.720" style="s2">uh and then just pick one</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.520" end="00:22:32.640" style="s2">like pick one of the the uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.720" end="00:22:34.000" style="s2">you know to-do list and just iterate</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.640" end="00:22:36.240" style="s2">with it and see how it works</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.000" end="00:22:37.760" style="s2">um that would be my my other</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.240" end="00:22:39.200" style="s2">recommendation if you can find someone</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.760" end="00:22:40.640" style="s2">to hold you accountable</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.200" end="00:22:42.240" style="s2">that also helps like if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.640" end="00:22:45.280" style="s2">friend you can be like dude</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.240" end="00:22:47.760" style="s2">call me today in the afternoon uh and</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.280" end="00:22:49.679" style="s2">make sure i&#39;ve done this</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.760" end="00:22:51.360" style="s2">uh that kind of stuff which you would</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.679" end="00:22:52.640" style="s2">also you get in school and you would get</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.360" end="00:22:53.679" style="s2">in a normal work environment it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.640" end="00:22:55.200" style="s2">someone looking over your shoulder and</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.679" end="00:22:56.799" style="s2">be like hey bro did you do that</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.200" end="00:22:58.559" style="s2">so that helps too if you can find</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.799" end="00:23:01.919" style="s2">someone to bring into</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.559" end="00:23:03.760" style="s2">a kind of system of accountability</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.919" end="00:23:04.960" style="s2">all right hopefully that was helpful to</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.760" end="00:23:05.840" style="s2">to you and</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.960" end="00:23:07.840" style="s2">it showed a little bit of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.840" end="00:23:08.640" style="s2">applicability of the metapsychology</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.840" end="00:23:10.159" style="s2">moving between</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.640" end="00:23:11.919" style="s2">installment and development i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.159" end="00:23:13.200" style="s2">really touch transcendence but you can</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.919" end="00:23:16.480" style="s2">imagine the loop</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.200" end="00:23:20.080" style="s2">but this dynamic between image of self</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.480" end="00:23:22.000" style="s2">folding into capacity development and</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.080" end="00:23:24.960" style="s2">capacity actualization which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.000" end="00:23:26.559" style="s2">production productivity that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.960" end="00:23:28.240" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.559" end="00:23:30.320" style="s2">move to be able to make and to be able</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.240" end="00:23:32.080" style="s2">to step out of oh it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.320" end="00:23:33.520" style="s2">i&#39;m not capable i&#39;m not efficient i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.080" end="00:23:35.919" style="s2">not productive like</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.520" end="00:23:37.440" style="s2">maybe is not the actual issue it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.919" end="00:23:38.559" style="s2">an issue of skill it&#39;s not an issue of</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.440" end="00:23:40.320" style="s2">becoming</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.559" end="00:23:41.600" style="s2">more attuned and adept with operating on</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.320" end="00:23:44.000" style="s2">what you&#39;re operating on</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.600" end="00:23:45.919" style="s2">the issue is actually in the domain of</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.000" end="00:23:47.600" style="s2">insole and it&#39;s an issue of clarifying</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.919" end="00:23:52.000" style="s2">the image of what you are and</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.600" end="00:23:54.480" style="s2">who you&#39;re doing excuse me what you are</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.000" end="00:23:55.679" style="s2">and why you&#39;re doing what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.480" end="00:23:58.799" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.679" end="00:24:02.799" style="s2">that can clarify a lot</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.799" end="00:24:02.799" style="s2">all right thank you more questions</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.520" end="00:24:08.960" style="s2">thank you auntie so man you had a</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.919" end="00:24:11.520" style="s2">question that i i&#39;ll read for her</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.960" end="00:24:12.960" style="s2">considering pre-tragic tragic and</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.520" end="00:24:15.120" style="s2">post-tragic</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.960" end="00:24:16.000" style="s2">how do compounded iterations of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.120" end="00:24:19.840" style="s2">cycle</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.000" end="00:24:23.200" style="s2">play out in your framework um</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.840" end="00:24:26.559" style="s2">yeah so this is a deep question</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.200" end="00:24:30.640" style="s2">because stations</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.559" end="00:24:33.840" style="s2">are different than stages so</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.640" end="00:24:36.960" style="s2">there are compounding iterations</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.840" end="00:24:41.840" style="s2">within the pre-tragic tragic</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.960" end="00:24:44.159" style="s2">post-tragic and there are basically</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.840" end="00:24:46.880" style="s2">movements in life that have you cycling</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.159" end="00:24:49.440" style="s2">through those stages repeatedly</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.880" end="00:24:51.279" style="s2">so unlike when you&#39;re moving up stages</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.440" end="00:24:54.159" style="s2">of hierarchical complexity</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.279" end="00:24:56.880" style="s2">like you move up to a higher stage and</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.159" end="00:25:00.080" style="s2">you solidify the capacity to work there</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.880" end="00:25:01.440" style="s2">and if basically the context remains</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.080" end="00:25:03.200" style="s2">relatively the same you&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.440" end="00:25:06.640" style="s2">able to just operate</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.200" end="00:25:08.720" style="s2">at that level repeatedly</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.640" end="00:25:10.400" style="s2">there are these enduring stage</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.720" end="00:25:11.200" style="s2">acquisitions which in my model under</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.400" end="00:25:13.919" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.200" end="00:25:16.159" style="s2">are in the place of capacity so that</p>

<p begin="00:25:16.159" end="00:25:20.320" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.039" end="00:25:24.320" style="s2">just there but stations</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.320" end="00:25:25.279" style="s2">don&#39;t um stations don&#39;t have that same</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.320" end="00:25:29.679" style="s2">dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.279" end="00:25:32.720" style="s2">stations need to be repeatedly</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.679" end="00:25:35.840" style="s2">kind of moved through and this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.720" end="00:25:40.240" style="s2">the compounding is i think important</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.840" end="00:25:43.760" style="s2">so most people um</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.240" end="00:25:47.200" style="s2">in early childhood if</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.760" end="00:25:48.480" style="s2">like you are lucky and for many because</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.200" end="00:25:51.279" style="s2">this is the case</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.480" end="00:25:52.400" style="s2">you are pretty tragic developmentally</p>

<p begin="00:25:52.400" end="00:25:58.400" style="s2">pretty tragic like you&#39;re a child um</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.440" end="00:25:59.679" style="s2">you know this makes sense and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.400" end="00:26:01.279" style="s2">usually at some point in late</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.679" end="00:26:03.120" style="s2">adolescence when you&#39;re moving to</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.279" end="00:26:06.320" style="s2">resolve the adolescent identity</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.120" end="00:26:09.760" style="s2">crisis that you have the opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.320" end="00:26:10.400" style="s2">to confront tragedy now many people get</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.760" end="00:26:13.919" style="s2">tragedy</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.400" end="00:26:16.159" style="s2">much much earlier and the human uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.919" end="00:26:17.360" style="s2">psyche can adapt to that and many</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.159" end="00:26:20.559" style="s2">remarkable people</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.360" end="00:26:23.440" style="s2">in fact emerge precisely because</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.559" end="00:26:25.360" style="s2">uh of early tragedy they emerge</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.440" end="00:26:28.320" style="s2">profoundly</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.360" end="00:26:29.360" style="s2">uh remarkable capacity of people but the</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.320" end="00:26:32.720" style="s2">the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.360" end="00:26:34.880" style="s2">modal course is one where in late</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.720" end="00:26:38.159" style="s2">adolescence this is when you have your</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.880" end="00:26:41.520" style="s2">first confrontations with real profound</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.159" end="00:26:46.720" style="s2">limitation death illness</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.520" end="00:26:49.679" style="s2">failure evil things of that nature</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.720" end="00:26:51.600" style="s2">and so resolving your relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.679" end="00:26:52.159" style="s2">that can take a very long time and</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.600" end="00:26:55.760" style="s2">usually</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.159" end="00:26:57.200" style="s2">once you&#39;ve seen it then you can start</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.760" end="00:27:01.600" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.200" end="00:27:01.600" style="s2">detecting tragedy in many many places</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.919" end="00:27:07.360" style="s2">and you can actually metabolize a</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.840" end="00:27:10.000" style="s2">tragedy that you&#39;ve witnessed or</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.360" end="00:27:12.880" style="s2">experienced in your own life</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.000" end="00:27:14.720" style="s2">and move in a proper sense into a</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.880" end="00:27:18.480" style="s2">post-tragic relationship</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.720" end="00:27:21.919" style="s2">to that kind of tragedy right okay i get</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.480" end="00:27:24.880" style="s2">family members dying as a tragedy like</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.919" end="00:27:26.799" style="s2">and i can actually now be at these</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.880" end="00:27:30.080" style="s2">funerals and feel the full</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.799" end="00:27:31.039" style="s2">intensity of the sorrow but also feel</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.080" end="00:27:36.240" style="s2">myself</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.039" end="00:27:40.000" style="s2">uh able to make meaning of it</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.240" end="00:27:43.679" style="s2">and be someone have an image of who i am</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.000" end="00:27:45.600" style="s2">in tragedy that i can bear right you you</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.679" end="00:27:47.520" style="s2">know you&#39;ve hit a tragedy</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.600" end="00:27:50.159" style="s2">when you there&#39;s an unbearable image of</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.520" end="00:27:53.600" style="s2">self when the identity structure</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.159" end="00:27:55.279" style="s2">itself cannot maintain uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.600" end="00:27:58.159" style="s2">and so most people experience this with</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.279" end="00:28:02.480" style="s2">breakdown like uncontrollable tears</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.159" end="00:28:04.720" style="s2">uh things like you know overwhelming</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.480" end="00:28:06.799" style="s2">uh depression to the point of almost</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.720" end="00:28:10.080" style="s2">like a catatonic state where you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.799" end="00:28:11.520" style="s2">move sort of the freeze response</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.080" end="00:28:13.120" style="s2">so you know you&#39;ve had a tragedy proper</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.520" end="00:28:16.080" style="s2">when you have that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.120" end="00:28:17.279" style="s2">reaction because what&#39;s happened is that</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.080" end="00:28:20.799" style="s2">the who you are</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.279" end="00:28:22.399" style="s2">the image of self uh has been lifted up</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.799" end="00:28:26.559" style="s2">into a context that</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.399" end="00:28:29.919" style="s2">is completely inhospitable to that match</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.559" end="00:28:32.240" style="s2">right um and so you have to there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.919" end="00:28:32.720" style="s2">forced evolution of the image of self</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.240" end="00:28:36.480" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.720" end="00:28:39.360" style="s2">the post tragic occurs when you have</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.480" end="00:28:40.559" style="s2">you have kind of like seen through the</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.360" end="00:28:42.880" style="s2">unbearable image</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.559" end="00:28:44.080" style="s2">into a new image of self where now the</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.880" end="00:28:45.760" style="s2">self can</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.080" end="00:28:48.799" style="s2">be in the tragedy without being</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.760" end="00:28:52.880" style="s2">destroyed by the tragedy</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.799" end="00:28:53.440" style="s2">and uh so so you can do that in a domain</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.880" end="00:28:55.440" style="s2">of tragedy</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.440" end="00:28:57.440" style="s2">like i said like losing beloved family</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.440" end="00:28:58.480" style="s2">members and then now you have this</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.440" end="00:29:00.159" style="s2">ability</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.480" end="00:29:01.600" style="s2">to be with people who&#39;ve lost family</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.159" end="00:29:05.039" style="s2">members right um</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.600" end="00:29:08.159" style="s2">and you have an ability to uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.039" end="00:29:11.919" style="s2">be moved to your core by it but not be</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.159" end="00:29:14.080" style="s2">shattered by it to the extent that um</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.919" end="00:29:15.279" style="s2">you are like i said incapacitated by the</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.080" end="00:29:17.279" style="s2">nature of the tragedy</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.279" end="00:29:18.480" style="s2">and almost can&#39;t take responsibility for</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.279" end="00:29:20.159" style="s2">your actions like</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.480" end="00:29:21.600" style="s2">in the context of real tragedy when</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.159" end="00:29:24.240" style="s2">you&#39;re living a tragedy it&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.600" end="00:29:26.159" style="s2">like in the moment right now</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.240" end="00:29:27.679" style="s2">you are often relieved from normal</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.159" end="00:29:29.840" style="s2">responsibility because you&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.679" end="00:29:31.679" style="s2">tragedy like if your mom dies</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.840" end="00:29:34.320" style="s2">you&#39;re like hey guys i can&#39;t go to work</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.679" end="00:29:36.960" style="s2">next week my mom died</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.320" end="00:29:38.720" style="s2">right so like you&#39;re you&#39;re in it and so</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.960" end="00:29:40.640" style="s2">one of the dangers of</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.720" end="00:29:43.440" style="s2">moving out of the pre-tragic into the</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.640" end="00:29:44.880" style="s2">tragic and getting stuck in the tragic</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.440" end="00:29:46.240" style="s2">is that you can have an identity</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.880" end="00:29:46.799" style="s2">structure and this is sometimes pointed</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.240" end="00:29:49.039" style="s2">to it like</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.799" end="00:29:50.880" style="s2">as like the victim mentality you can</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.039" end="00:29:51.200" style="s2">have an identity structure that itself</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.880" end="00:29:54.080" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.200" end="00:29:56.000" style="s2">fueled off of residing in strategy and</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.080" end="00:29:57.600" style="s2">being freed from quote unquote normal</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.000" end="00:30:00.799" style="s2">responsibility because you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.600" end="00:30:02.640" style="s2">tragedy right so that</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.799" end="00:30:04.480" style="s2">again phase specific there are moments</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.640" end="00:30:06.320" style="s2">in life when yes</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.480" end="00:30:08.640" style="s2">you&#39;re in a tragedy you are relieved</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.320" end="00:30:11.279" style="s2">from normal responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.640" end="00:30:13.440" style="s2">but you need to then find a way to</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.279" end="00:30:16.159" style="s2">evolve the image of</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.440" end="00:30:18.159" style="s2">self so that it&#39;s not destroyed by the</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.159" end="00:30:20.399" style="s2">tragic context but then can actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.159" end="00:30:21.520" style="s2">sometimes thrive in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.399" end="00:30:22.799" style="s2">tragedy</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.520" end="00:30:25.200" style="s2">so but the point i&#39;m making is that you</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.799" end="00:30:28.799" style="s2">can run that in one domain of life</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.200" end="00:30:31.440" style="s2">or at one level like um</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.799" end="00:30:33.520" style="s2">you know sometimes it just happens in</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.440" end="00:30:36.080" style="s2">like dogs dying or</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.520" end="00:30:36.880" style="s2">legs being broken or college is not</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.080" end="00:30:38.240" style="s2">getting into</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.880" end="00:30:39.919" style="s2">it&#39;s the first thing that breaks the</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.240" end="00:30:42.240" style="s2">bubble of the pre-tragic</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.919" end="00:30:43.279" style="s2">and you engage tragedy and then you</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.240" end="00:30:46.640" style="s2">become post-trad</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.279" end="00:30:49.279" style="s2">in a kind of limited set of contexts</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.640" end="00:30:50.000" style="s2">but then the bigger tragedy occurs or a</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.279" end="00:30:52.399" style="s2">tragedy of</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.000" end="00:30:53.600" style="s2">a kind you couldn&#39;t even imagine before</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.399" end="00:30:57.440" style="s2">occurs</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.600" end="00:31:02.399" style="s2">or you become aware of the existential</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.440" end="00:31:04.559" style="s2">human tragedy at scale right</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.399" end="00:31:06.559" style="s2">and so what that means is that now you</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.559" end="00:31:07.120" style="s2">need to run that same operation you just</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.559" end="00:31:09.440" style="s2">did</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.120" end="00:31:10.480" style="s2">hopefully in this where you were like in</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.440" end="00:31:13.519" style="s2">a safe practice</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.480" end="00:31:15.600" style="s2">container limited tragedy</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.519" end="00:31:17.200" style="s2">you can run that exercise you did to</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.600" end="00:31:20.240" style="s2">engage now the more</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.200" end="00:31:23.440" style="s2">the larger tragedy um</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.240" end="00:31:24.320" style="s2">and uh and then again the unbearable</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.440" end="00:31:26.880" style="s2">image of</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.320" end="00:31:28.559" style="s2">the unbearable image of self the</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.880" end="00:31:31.840" style="s2">shattering of that image</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.559" end="00:31:32.159" style="s2">and then the reconstituting of the image</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.840" end="00:31:33.600" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.159" end="00:31:35.840" style="s2">and that will happen again and again and</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.600" end="00:31:36.960" style="s2">again throughout life</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.840" end="00:31:38.960" style="s2">so it&#39;s not that like you become</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.960" end="00:31:40.799" style="s2">post-tragic and like boom</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.960" end="00:31:42.960" style="s2">you&#39;re post-tragic forever it&#39;s like no</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.799" end="00:31:45.519" style="s2">you just had practice doing that</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.960" end="00:31:46.720" style="s2">run of the stations you&#39;re going to get</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.519" end="00:31:48.720" style="s2">more practice</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.720" end="00:31:50.399" style="s2">you need to become good at doing that</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.720" end="00:31:52.720" style="s2">run of the stations</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.399" end="00:31:54.720" style="s2">uh rather than thinking that if you</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.720" end="00:31:56.240" style="s2">solve the problem of tragedy</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.720" end="00:31:58.000" style="s2">once you&#39;ve solved it everywhere that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.240" end="00:31:59.679" style="s2">the wrong mentality that&#39;s like the way</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.000" end="00:32:00.640" style="s2">a developmentalist thinks about it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.679" end="00:32:02.559" style="s2">not true</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.640" end="00:32:04.240" style="s2">you actually need to get used to the</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.559" end="00:32:07.679" style="s2">general process of</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.240" end="00:32:09.760" style="s2">running the stations and so just think</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.679" end="00:32:13.120" style="s2">about like if you experience profound</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.760" end="00:32:13.120" style="s2">tragedy like in your 30s</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.519" end="00:32:17.279" style="s2">but then you have this family and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.960" end="00:32:18.880" style="s2">with these people now for 30 40 more</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.279" end="00:32:20.799" style="s2">years and you deepen the love</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.880" end="00:32:23.039" style="s2">relationship with these people</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.799" end="00:32:24.320" style="s2">and then like your wife dies or your</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.039" end="00:32:25.919" style="s2">child dies</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.320" end="00:32:27.519" style="s2">completely different than the tragedy of</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.919" end="00:32:30.960" style="s2">your parents dying when you were 30</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.519" end="00:32:32.559" style="s2">right so much more profound and it needs</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.960" end="00:32:34.320" style="s2">to be more profound because you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.559" end="00:32:36.240" style="s2">become and sold with these people you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.320" end="00:32:38.080" style="s2">gone down and into these</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.240" end="00:32:39.360" style="s2">lower relationships so that&#39;s the other</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.080" end="00:32:41.919" style="s2">thing to get is that</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.360" end="00:32:43.120" style="s2">the deeper the ensoment the deeper the</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.919" end="00:32:45.840" style="s2">tragedy</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.120" end="00:32:47.200" style="s2">like the more you love the more it hurts</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.840" end="00:32:50.080" style="s2">when the person dies</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.200" end="00:32:51.600" style="s2">now if you&#39;ve had experience running the</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.080" end="00:32:54.159" style="s2">stations then you can actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.600" end="00:32:55.120" style="s2">use that more profound depth of</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.159" end="00:32:57.919" style="s2">dramaticity</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.120" end="00:32:58.960" style="s2">to catalyze even greater evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.919" end="00:33:02.000" style="s2">image of self</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.960" end="00:33:03.039" style="s2">right so there&#39;s this like very profound</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.000" end="00:33:06.080" style="s2">dynamic of like</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.039" end="00:33:09.200" style="s2">risking total heartbreak</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.080" end="00:33:10.960" style="s2">in the process of installment and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.200" end="00:33:14.960" style="s2">kind of like the fuel that</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.960" end="00:33:18.799" style="s2">drives the evolution of character um</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.960" end="00:33:23.360" style="s2">so yes this was a good question</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.799" end="00:33:24.880" style="s2">um and there&#39;s more to say uh about that</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.360" end="00:33:26.640" style="s2">and then of course there are other</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.880" end="00:33:29.679" style="s2">stadiums as well</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.640" end="00:33:29.679" style="s2">which we can come to</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.440" end="00:33:35.519" style="s2">thank you manu for the question thanks</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.279" end="00:33:37.600" style="s2">zach so another question by</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.519" end="00:33:39.200" style="s2">dorial uh please don&#39;t meet your</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.600" end="00:33:42.399" style="s2">secretary</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.200" end="00:33:43.760" style="s2">hey zach thank you um my question is</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.399" end="00:33:45.679" style="s2">what&#39;s your take on the state of</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.760" end="00:33:46.960" style="s2">psychotherapy and</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.679" end="00:33:48.880" style="s2">what types of therapy are most</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.960" end="00:33:51.120" style="s2">supportive of installment</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.880" end="00:33:52.559" style="s2">and kind of how does therapy play a role</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.120" end="00:33:57.360" style="s2">in supporting transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.559" end="00:34:02.320" style="s2">if at all totally good question</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.360" end="00:34:02.320" style="s2">um so it&#39;s a few things one is that</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.960" end="00:34:06.320" style="s2">you know there was a shift and i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.760" end="00:34:08.560" style="s2">sure</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.320" end="00:34:09.520" style="s2">precisely when to date it but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.560" end="00:34:13.119" style="s2">definitely</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.520" end="00:34:16.399" style="s2">in full swing by the 90s away</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.119" end="00:34:19.760" style="s2">from extended</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.399" end="00:34:23.200" style="s2">depth psychological treatment modalities</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.760" end="00:34:26.280" style="s2">and towards truncated</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.200" end="00:34:28.079" style="s2">cognitive behavioral and eventually</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.280" end="00:34:30.079" style="s2">psychopharmaceutical</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.079" end="00:34:31.280" style="s2">treatment modalities and so that&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.079" end="00:34:32.720" style="s2">noting which is that</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.280" end="00:34:35.839" style="s2">had we been having this conversation in</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.720" end="00:34:37.040" style="s2">like the 60s or 70s</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.839" end="00:34:39.520" style="s2">i it would be completely different</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.040" end="00:34:41.280" style="s2">conversation first of all few many many</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.520" end="00:34:44.159" style="s2">fewer people were pursuing</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.280" end="00:34:45.679" style="s2">things like quote unquote therapy and</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.159" end="00:34:49.359" style="s2">the main modalities that were</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.679" end="00:34:51.119" style="s2">popular like gestalt therapy rogerian</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.359" end="00:34:53.040" style="s2">therapy</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.119" end="00:34:56.399" style="s2">classical psychoanalysis jungian</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.040" end="00:35:00.560" style="s2">analysis those things</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.399" end="00:35:03.280" style="s2">had never been even associated with or</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.560" end="00:35:05.599" style="s2">even potentially watered down by things</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.280" end="00:35:09.760" style="s2">like cognitive behavioral therapy</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.599" end="00:35:11.280" style="s2">and um forms of psychiatric care</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.760" end="00:35:14.720" style="s2">basically administered</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.280" end="00:35:17.760" style="s2">by um</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.720" end="00:35:20.880" style="s2">you know large uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.760" end="00:35:23.280" style="s2">for-profit uh healthcare</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.880" end="00:35:25.359" style="s2">agencies that&#39;s the first thing which is</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.280" end="00:35:29.200" style="s2">that the context in which one</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.359" end="00:35:31.599" style="s2">now pursues therapeutic modalities</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.200" end="00:35:34.800" style="s2">is one that has changed radically in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.599" end="00:35:36.560" style="s2">past 30 years and i think the quality of</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.800" end="00:35:39.680" style="s2">care that has been administered</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.560" end="00:35:43.040" style="s2">has decreased</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.680" end="00:35:44.880" style="s2">even as it has increased in quantity the</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.040" end="00:35:48.400" style="s2">number of people being treated</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.880" end="00:35:49.920" style="s2">for psychiatric and psychotherapeutic</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.400" end="00:35:51.200" style="s2">conditions has increased but the quality</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.920" end="00:35:54.079" style="s2">of treatments come down so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.200" end="00:35:57.200" style="s2">first thing to mention which is that</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.079" end="00:35:59.920" style="s2">i&#39;d love to say like go singing go see a</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.200" end="00:36:03.280" style="s2">jungian it&#39;s like a therapist</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.920" end="00:36:05.040" style="s2">you know but to do that you need to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.280" end="00:36:07.040" style="s2">basically independently wealthy and be</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.040" end="00:36:09.920" style="s2">lucky enough to live in a place where</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.040" end="00:36:10.960" style="s2">some of these guys work if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.920" end="00:36:12.320" style="s2">independently welfare and you have</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.960" end="00:36:14.720" style="s2">health insurance</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.320" end="00:36:15.359" style="s2">then you actually are limited to those</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.720" end="00:36:19.040" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.359" end="00:36:22.079" style="s2">within your uh network</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.040" end="00:36:25.920" style="s2">and most of them will incentivize the</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.079" end="00:36:27.839" style="s2">briefest briefest duration treatment</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.920" end="00:36:29.440" style="s2">and also incentivize those treatments</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.839" end="00:36:31.200" style="s2">that end up sending you towards</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.440" end="00:36:34.560" style="s2">psychiatric medications</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.200" end="00:36:38.440" style="s2">so there&#39;s been a medicalization</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.560" end="00:36:41.040" style="s2">and a biologicalization of</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.440" end="00:36:42.560" style="s2">psychotherapy so that&#39;s just worth</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.040" end="00:36:46.000" style="s2">putting out there</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.560" end="00:36:49.280" style="s2">so that&#39;s also like a word of caution</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.000" end="00:36:51.920" style="s2">which is that if you are deep in</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.280" end="00:36:54.160" style="s2">an insolvent process which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.920" end="00:36:56.240" style="s2">that you&#39;re likely experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.160" end="00:36:57.440" style="s2">intensities of emotion such as</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.240" end="00:37:00.800" style="s2">depression</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.440" end="00:37:04.320" style="s2">anxiety difficulty sleeping intense</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.800" end="00:37:06.000" style="s2">dream life incursion on waking life</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.320" end="00:37:08.000" style="s2">interpersonal difficulties things of</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.000" end="00:37:11.680" style="s2">that nature if you&#39;re experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.000" end="00:37:14.880" style="s2">those and you go to</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.680" end="00:37:17.280" style="s2">a mainstream psychotherapist you could</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.880" end="00:37:21.040" style="s2">easily be routed into</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.280" end="00:37:22.560" style="s2">taking uh psychiatric medications</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.040" end="00:37:24.160" style="s2">that&#39;s the main thing that will happen</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.560" end="00:37:28.240" style="s2">to you</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.160" end="00:37:29.040" style="s2">so uh and i could give a whole long talk</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.240" end="00:37:33.520" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.040" end="00:37:36.320" style="s2">the dangers of that um the iatrogenic</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.520" end="00:37:37.200" style="s2">plague actually that&#39;s sweeping through</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.320" end="00:37:41.119" style="s2">the country</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.200" end="00:37:43.599" style="s2">now more so after the pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.119" end="00:37:45.520" style="s2">of secondary and third order</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.599" end="00:37:47.200" style="s2">physiological and psychological effects</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.520" end="00:37:50.400" style="s2">from psychiatric medications</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.200" end="00:37:52.240" style="s2">so first thing is</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.400" end="00:37:53.920" style="s2">if you&#39;re tackling issues of installment</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.240" end="00:37:55.280" style="s2">you&#39;re going to have intense emotional</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.920" end="00:37:56.720" style="s2">dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.280" end="00:37:58.800" style="s2">if you bring some of those to the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.720" end="00:38:02.000" style="s2">people they&#39;ll try to put you on meds</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.800" end="00:38:05.040" style="s2">which is worth noting so if you bring</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.000" end="00:38:05.040" style="s2">them to the right people</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.200" end="00:38:08.960" style="s2">then you need to be thinking about a few</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.480" end="00:38:12.079" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.960" end="00:38:14.400" style="s2">if you&#39;re doing therapy for installment</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.079" end="00:38:16.800" style="s2">now the thing worth mentioning is that</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.400" end="00:38:19.359" style="s2">all three of these modalities are in</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.800" end="00:38:20.640" style="s2">every exchange every interaction all the</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.359" end="00:38:25.200" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.640" end="00:38:28.240" style="s2">so you need to</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.200" end="00:38:29.599" style="s2">think about at least a few things when</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.240" end="00:38:32.880" style="s2">you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.599" end="00:38:35.599" style="s2">seeking someone as a</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.880" end="00:38:37.359" style="s2">sometime called this psychopump right</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.599" end="00:38:38.160" style="s2">this is the traditional word an alchemy</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.359" end="00:38:41.119" style="s2">like a</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.160" end="00:38:41.119" style="s2">a soul guide</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.200" end="00:38:48.800" style="s2">which is what the therapist ought to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.400" end="00:38:52.000" style="s2">so the first one is shared world view</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.800" end="00:38:53.359" style="s2">shared framework shared sense of what</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.000" end="00:38:54.160" style="s2">the psyche is so this would be in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.359" end="00:38:56.800" style="s2">domain of</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.160" end="00:38:58.320" style="s2">development cognition thinking what is</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.800" end="00:39:01.440" style="s2">this therapist working model</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.320" end="00:39:03.520" style="s2">of the mind</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.440" end="00:39:04.880" style="s2">does this therapist for example believe</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.520" end="00:39:08.079" style="s2">depression as a result</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.880" end="00:39:11.119" style="s2">of a you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.079" end="00:39:12.720" style="s2">messed up neurochemistry or</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.119" end="00:39:15.040" style="s2">is this therapist actually open to the</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.720" end="00:39:18.320" style="s2">idea that depression could be</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.040" end="00:39:22.240" style="s2">a legitimate move through</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.320" end="00:39:24.160" style="s2">phases and stations of emotion right</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.240" end="00:39:25.839" style="s2">that&#39;s just an example so and then</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.160" end="00:39:29.200" style="s2">another thing is like is this</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.839" end="00:39:30.960" style="s2">therapist how what are they politically</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.200" end="00:39:32.960" style="s2">right like would i agree with their</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.960" end="00:39:34.640" style="s2">political views um</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.960" end="00:39:36.160" style="s2">do they have strong enough political</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.640" end="00:39:37.680" style="s2">views that when i&#39;m voicing something</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.160" end="00:39:40.160" style="s2">that actually bring politics in</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.680" end="00:39:41.520" style="s2">like that&#39;s a little weird so like you</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.160" end="00:39:42.000" style="s2">need to ask a lot of questions of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.520" end="00:39:44.160" style="s2">therapist</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.000" end="00:39:45.599" style="s2">to figure out if you would actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.160" end="00:39:46.960" style="s2">trust yourself to their guidance and</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.599" end="00:39:47.680" style="s2">that&#39;s all stuff in like the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.960" end="00:39:50.960" style="s2">domain</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.680" end="00:39:54.800" style="s2">um in the domain of</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.960" end="00:39:55.599" style="s2">insolent uh you you need to think is</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.800" end="00:39:58.079" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.599" end="00:39:59.920" style="s2">cognitive behavioral therapy which they</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.079" end="00:40:01.440" style="s2">intend to give me tools or i walk away</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.920" end="00:40:02.400" style="s2">in 20 minutes and i just take care of</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.440" end="00:40:04.480" style="s2">myself</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.400" end="00:40:07.040" style="s2">or is this someone who&#39;s looking for an</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.480" end="00:40:09.920" style="s2">open engagement of working with</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.040" end="00:40:11.280" style="s2">my living images of self right and so</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.920" end="00:40:13.680" style="s2">that would mean</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.280" end="00:40:15.760" style="s2">more longer term conversations where</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.680" end="00:40:17.200" style="s2">they&#39;re open-ended and you can do dream</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.760" end="00:40:19.920" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.200" end="00:40:20.800" style="s2">and you can do free association work and</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.920" end="00:40:23.599" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.800" end="00:40:25.680" style="s2">dig into the psyche rather than just fix</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.599" end="00:40:28.319" style="s2">it as quickly as possible with drugs or</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.680" end="00:40:30.640" style="s2">cognitive behavioral therapy</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.319" end="00:40:34.240" style="s2">and then the transcendent bit and where</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.640" end="00:40:34.240" style="s2">therapists can help with transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.480" end="00:40:41.599" style="s2">you know i&#39;m not sure that they should</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.560" end="00:40:46.400" style="s2">like uh i think there needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.599" end="00:40:49.520" style="s2">a division of labor uh to some extent</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.400" end="00:40:51.119" style="s2">in the you know kind of working with the</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.520" end="00:40:54.720" style="s2">elements of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.119" end="00:40:56.960" style="s2">of the psyche and you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.720" end="00:40:59.280" style="s2">many therapists will have had training</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.960" end="00:41:01.119" style="s2">in mindfulness practice and they&#39;ll know</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.280" end="00:41:02.800" style="s2">the usefulness of like dialectical</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.119" end="00:41:03.359" style="s2">behavioral therapy which is kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.800" end="00:41:06.880" style="s2">a zen</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.359" end="00:41:10.800" style="s2">inspired approach um</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.880" end="00:41:14.720" style="s2">but to actually get transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.800" end="00:41:18.800" style="s2">extraction of symbolic immortality um</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.720" end="00:41:20.400" style="s2">uh you know there&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.800" end="00:41:23.040" style="s2">it may be better to actually keep</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.400" end="00:41:24.640" style="s2">therapy as over there helping me kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.040" end="00:41:26.560" style="s2">adjust to the world and the domains of</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.640" end="00:41:27.920" style="s2">development and kind of like clarify the</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.560" end="00:41:30.480" style="s2">images of self</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.920" end="00:41:32.079" style="s2">um but not seeking the kind of quote</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.480" end="00:41:35.359" style="s2">unquote religious</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.079" end="00:41:36.480" style="s2">from the therapist um but rather seeking</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.359" end="00:41:40.720" style="s2">the religious</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.480" end="00:41:42.640" style="s2">from the religious um and uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.720" end="00:41:44.240" style="s2">and vice versa which is to say don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.640" end="00:41:47.920" style="s2">seek therapy</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.240" end="00:41:49.200" style="s2">from a zen priest right they don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.920" end="00:41:49.839" style="s2">they know how to meditate they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.200" end="00:41:52.480" style="s2">know how to</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.839" end="00:41:53.119" style="s2">give you psychotherapy and do dream work</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.480" end="00:41:55.280" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.119" end="00:41:56.880" style="s2">think about like whether you need to go</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.280" end="00:41:58.720" style="s2">back to graduate school or something</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.880" end="00:42:01.359" style="s2">it&#39;s like that&#39;s not there that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.720" end="00:42:02.800" style="s2">their uh domain so that sense of like</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.359" end="00:42:04.160" style="s2">and this goes back to wilder&#39;s sense of</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.800" end="00:42:06.079" style="s2">what an integral</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.160" end="00:42:07.280" style="s2">psychotherapy approach would be it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.079" end="00:42:08.640" style="s2">like you need to</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.280" end="00:42:09.920" style="s2">kind of come in and you need to look at</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.640" end="00:42:11.599" style="s2">a whole bunch of things and it may be</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.920" end="00:42:13.359" style="s2">that you learn karate from this guy and</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.599" end="00:42:15.040" style="s2">meditation from that guy and you do</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.359" end="00:42:17.200" style="s2">learn cognitive behavioral therapy</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.040" end="00:42:19.839" style="s2">from this therapist and then you have</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.200" end="00:42:22.720" style="s2">instead of an actual therapist like a</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.839" end="00:42:23.680" style="s2">coach or an elder or someone else who</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.720" end="00:42:26.800" style="s2">helps you clarify</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.680" end="00:42:29.440" style="s2">your image itself so</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.800" end="00:42:31.040" style="s2">so that&#39;s a little bit on there so both</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.440" end="00:42:33.520" style="s2">a word of caution</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.040" end="00:42:34.880" style="s2">and noting that uh yeah picking the</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.520" end="00:42:38.160" style="s2">right person is something that</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.880" end="00:42:39.119" style="s2">takes that takes time and figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.160" end="00:42:42.480" style="s2">if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.119" end="00:42:45.520" style="s2">is it that i need uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.480" end="00:42:48.960" style="s2">deep dream and image work and to process</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.520" end="00:42:50.319" style="s2">trauma and move through uh tragedy</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.960" end="00:42:52.000" style="s2">or is it actually that i&#39;m seeking the</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.319" end="00:42:53.520" style="s2">transcendent which</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.000" end="00:42:55.760" style="s2">which you&#39;re not going to get from</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.520" end="00:42:58.560" style="s2">therapy which you need to find a way to</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.760" end="00:43:02.240" style="s2">actually be in touch with a living</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.560" end="00:43:04.880" style="s2">tradition of symbolic immortality</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.240" end="00:43:07.440" style="s2">so thank you good question hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.880" end="00:43:07.440" style="s2">that was helpful</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.720" end="00:43:15.200" style="s2">thank you toriel so the question from</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.000" end="00:43:16.800" style="s2">ron that i&#39;ll read for him what light</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.200" end="00:43:17.680" style="s2">might the model shed on the current</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.800" end="00:43:19.680" style="s2">burning issue</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.680" end="00:43:21.200" style="s2">of individual inner work versus</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.680" end="00:43:23.280" style="s2">collective action</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.200" end="00:43:24.400" style="s2">the idea on one hand that one should get</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.280" end="00:43:26.720" style="s2">their own house in order</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.400" end="00:43:28.400" style="s2">before trying to change the world versus</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.720" end="00:43:32.160" style="s2">the belief that collective action is too</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.400" end="00:43:32.160" style="s2">urgent to wait for us to do individual</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.119" end="00:43:42.640" style="s2">yeah excellent excellent question um</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.240" end="00:43:44.480" style="s2">so i&#39;ve said a couple times i think i</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.640" end="00:43:47.680" style="s2">said it today too</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.480" end="00:43:49.359" style="s2">that when you when you run the i&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.680" end="00:43:50.800" style="s2">call the axiom2 rotation</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.359" end="00:43:53.280" style="s2">for those of you who know landry&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.800" end="00:43:55.040" style="s2">metaphysics when you when you run this</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.280" end="00:43:58.480" style="s2">rotation from the imminent</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.040" end="00:44:00.480" style="s2">uh excuse me from installment to</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.480" end="00:44:02.319" style="s2">development to transcendent and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.480" end="00:44:04.240" style="s2">back again to installment</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.319" end="00:44:05.920" style="s2">there&#39;s this moment there at the with</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.240" end="00:44:09.200" style="s2">the transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.920" end="00:44:10.400" style="s2">when you actually through choice create</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.200" end="00:44:13.440" style="s2">the conditions</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.400" end="00:44:16.960" style="s2">of your installment for the next loop</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.440" end="00:44:19.760" style="s2">um and so uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.960" end="00:44:21.359" style="s2">there it&#39;s kind of a false divide that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.760" end="00:44:23.599" style="s2">positive in the question</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.359" end="00:44:24.400" style="s2">and but it&#39;s ubiquitous in the culture</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.599" end="00:44:28.720" style="s2">which is that</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.400" end="00:44:32.880" style="s2">like there is a choice not to act</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.720" end="00:44:34.720" style="s2">um that you&#39;re you&#39;re always actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.880" end="00:44:36.640" style="s2">creating the conditions of your</p>

<p begin="00:44:36.640" end="00:44:41.200" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.359" end="00:44:44.480" style="s2">make so the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.200" end="00:44:45.520" style="s2">the separation of work on self from work</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.480" end="00:44:48.079" style="s2">on the world</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.520" end="00:44:51.040" style="s2">i think is in a sense a little bit part</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.079" end="00:44:54.079" style="s2">of the struggle that we&#39;re in um</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.040" end="00:44:54.560" style="s2">so uh and once that&#39;s said it&#39;s like oh</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.079" end="00:44:56.079" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.560" end="00:44:59.040" style="s2">of course and so i&#39;m not like i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.079" end="00:45:01.599" style="s2">saying this is like uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.040" end="00:45:03.280" style="s2">like an insight here but the the you</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.599" end="00:45:05.440" style="s2">know what it is is a very</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.280" end="00:45:07.839" style="s2">slight refrain of the question which is</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.440" end="00:45:10.960" style="s2">how can one responsibly act</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.839" end="00:45:16.319" style="s2">on the world while acting</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.960" end="00:45:18.560" style="s2">with one&#39;s own while acting upon oneself</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.319" end="00:45:20.000" style="s2">because the the basic truth of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.560" end="00:45:24.240" style="s2">psyche is that</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.000" end="00:45:24.240" style="s2">um you know the</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.040" end="00:45:28.079" style="s2">what am i trying to say</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.079" end="00:45:33.839" style="s2">so if you</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.560" end="00:45:41.839" style="s2">if you believe that you are</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.000" end="00:45:44.960" style="s2">complete and correct</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.839" end="00:45:48.079" style="s2">uh and then you act from that</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.960" end="00:45:49.520" style="s2">place um you are</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.079" end="00:45:51.200" style="s2">in a sense and this is what i meant by</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.520" end="00:45:53.520" style="s2">like the truth of the psyche</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.200" end="00:45:54.240" style="s2">in a sense you&#39;re moving against the</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.520" end="00:45:56.079" style="s2">dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.240" end="00:45:57.920" style="s2">of the psyche which is one as we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.079" end="00:46:01.040" style="s2">pointing out of</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.920" end="00:46:04.480" style="s2">transformation evolution</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.040" end="00:46:07.040" style="s2">growth right phases stations</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.480" end="00:46:08.800" style="s2">stages none of these are static all</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.040" end="00:46:12.720" style="s2">parts of the psyche</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.800" end="00:46:16.720" style="s2">are moving evolving changing</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.720" end="00:46:19.839" style="s2">so in a sense it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.720" end="00:46:21.040" style="s2">stance of profound epistemological</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.839" end="00:46:24.079" style="s2">humility</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.040" end="00:46:27.359" style="s2">uh and then a profound kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.079" end="00:46:30.720" style="s2">losing face in the domain of</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.359" end="00:46:32.640" style="s2">insolent and then a profound</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.720" end="00:46:34.000" style="s2">sense of one&#39;s own continuity with the</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.640" end="00:46:35.359" style="s2">rest of the world through symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.000" end="00:46:37.440" style="s2">immortality</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.359" end="00:46:39.839" style="s2">that all of these three domains to</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.440" end="00:46:41.920" style="s2">actually be engaged</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.839" end="00:46:43.920" style="s2">means you&#39;re engaging the world like</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.920" end="00:46:45.119" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re not going to clean up your</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.920" end="00:46:48.640" style="s2">own room</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.119" end="00:46:48.640" style="s2">by staying in your room</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.760" end="00:46:57.440" style="s2">there&#39;s a way that one must actually</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.800" end="00:47:01.040" style="s2">you know use uh use the world</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.440" end="00:47:05.520" style="s2">uh as the alchemical vessel</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.040" end="00:47:08.160" style="s2">in which one evolves the psyche</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.520" end="00:47:11.119" style="s2">so so moving beyond that split and this</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.160" end="00:47:13.599" style="s2">is one of the problems if you if you</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.119" end="00:47:15.520" style="s2">just meditate or you just do</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.599" end="00:47:18.640" style="s2">psychotherapeutic work or you</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.520" end="00:47:21.520" style="s2">just study um uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.640" end="00:47:25.839" style="s2">it&#39;s easy to actually have that fiction</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.520" end="00:47:25.839" style="s2">that i&#39;m removed from the world</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.640" end="00:47:30.480" style="s2">but if you try to weave all those</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.319" end="00:47:33.119" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.480" end="00:47:35.599" style="s2">right if you try to actually in a</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.119" end="00:47:40.160" style="s2">multi-modal way</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.599" end="00:47:43.359" style="s2">get that axiom to rotation moving</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.160" end="00:47:46.000" style="s2">you&#39;re going to end up falling</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.359" end="00:47:46.640" style="s2">deeper into the world now it may not</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.000" end="00:47:48.800" style="s2">look like</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.640" end="00:47:51.839" style="s2">activism as people know activism and i</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.800" end="00:47:53.920" style="s2">think that might be the actual question</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.839" end="00:47:56.400" style="s2">but it&#39;s going to look like engagement</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.920" end="00:48:01.040" style="s2">in the world</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.400" end="00:48:05.280" style="s2">so so yeah so but if the question is</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.040" end="00:48:08.640" style="s2">should one participate in social</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.280" end="00:48:11.680" style="s2">media and in political</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.640" end="00:48:12.319" style="s2">action campaigns uh as they are covered</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.680" end="00:48:16.160" style="s2">by</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.319" end="00:48:19.520" style="s2">social media and the news media um</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.160" end="00:48:22.800" style="s2">my responsibility like maybe maybe not</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.520" end="00:48:25.040" style="s2">uh you know um</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.800" end="00:48:26.160" style="s2">so that would be the that would be the</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.040" end="00:48:29.040" style="s2">thing yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.160" end="00:48:29.520" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s not clear to me at all</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.040" end="00:48:34.880" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.520" end="00:48:36.880" style="s2">um what counts as political action</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.880" end="00:48:39.760" style="s2">and often what counts as quote unquote</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.880" end="00:48:42.240" style="s2">working on the problems of the world</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.760" end="00:48:43.359" style="s2">it&#39;s not only clear to me that those uh</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.240" end="00:48:44.480" style="s2">those things should be</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.359" end="00:48:45.839" style="s2">undertaken by the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.480" end="00:48:47.280" style="s2">undertaking them and so that&#39;s maybe</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.839" end="00:48:48.800" style="s2">more directly to your question</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.280" end="00:48:50.559" style="s2">which is that it&#39;s easy to get into</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.800" end="00:48:52.000" style="s2">situation especially in the dynamics of</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.559" end="00:48:54.319" style="s2">installment and especially in</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.000" end="00:48:57.680" style="s2">contemporary cultural contexts</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.319" end="00:49:00.960" style="s2">it&#39;s easy to get into a situation of</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.680" end="00:49:04.160" style="s2">reifying the pre-tragic or</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.960" end="00:49:08.400" style="s2">prolonging and complicating the tragic</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.160" end="00:49:11.280" style="s2">uh by engaging in a lot of the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.400" end="00:49:12.079" style="s2">post-modern late capitalist forms of</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.280" end="00:49:14.800" style="s2">identity</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.079" end="00:49:17.040" style="s2">politics and protests so that&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.800" end="00:49:20.400" style="s2">noting as well that</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.040" end="00:49:23.440" style="s2">uh some of those dynamics are uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.400" end="00:49:24.960" style="s2">unhealthy now they&#39;re not any more or</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.440" end="00:49:26.160" style="s2">less unhealthy than the other things in</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.960" end="00:49:27.760" style="s2">our culture</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.160" end="00:49:30.640" style="s2">like being obsessed with professional</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.760" end="00:49:34.480" style="s2">sports or uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.640" end="00:49:37.599" style="s2">overt materialism uh and ladder climbing</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.480" end="00:49:40.079" style="s2">careerism um so these things are</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.599" end="00:49:41.359" style="s2">you know equally as pathological as what</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.079" end="00:49:45.359" style="s2">you&#39;re seeing in</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.359" end="00:49:47.119" style="s2">uh kind of uh protest culture</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.359" end="00:49:48.559" style="s2">uh so that&#39;s a little bit more there may</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.119" end="00:49:50.640" style="s2">be more directly to the question</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.559" end="00:49:52.960" style="s2">but if but if you&#39;re actually doing the</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.640" end="00:49:54.160" style="s2">dynamic of the metapsychologies i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.960" end="00:49:55.760" style="s2">describing it</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.160" end="00:49:57.440" style="s2">then you&#39;re definitely in the world</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.760" end="00:50:00.880" style="s2">working on the world working with the</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.440" end="00:50:04.079" style="s2">world being transformed by the world</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.880" end="00:50:08.160" style="s2">whether that&#39;s visible eligible</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.079" end="00:50:13.839" style="s2">as political action or something is</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.160" end="00:50:13.839" style="s2">it&#39;s not clear</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.079" end="00:50:19.520" style="s2">we&#39;re on for the question so anita</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.680" end="00:50:21.839" style="s2">had a question would you like to meet</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.520" end="00:50:21.839" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.680" end="00:50:30.240" style="s2">hi zach i heard you mentioned last week</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.240" end="00:50:32.000" style="s2">that you worked with a body worker to</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.240" end="00:50:35.680" style="s2">help you navigate yourself</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.000" end="00:50:38.720" style="s2">through your installment stations</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.680" end="00:50:40.559" style="s2">i was wondering what your thoughts are</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.720" end="00:50:42.720" style="s2">regarding the physical body in</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.559" end="00:50:44.240" style="s2">relationship to the three modalities of</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.720" end="00:50:48.319" style="s2">the psyche</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.240" end="00:50:51.760" style="s2">especially the insolvent embodiment</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.319" end="00:50:54.880" style="s2">interface i&#39;m a body worker</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.760" end="00:50:58.319" style="s2">and i often sense</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.880" end="00:51:00.319" style="s2">a deep connection and a deep innate</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.319" end="00:51:03.359" style="s2">intelligence with the physical body and</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.319" end="00:51:04.720" style="s2">its efforts to communicate with us</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.359" end="00:51:06.960" style="s2">i wondered what your thoughts were on</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.720" end="00:51:06.960" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.680" end="00:51:11.839" style="s2">totally excellent question this is also</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.839" end="00:51:13.520" style="s2">an area where i haven&#39;t done</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.839" end="00:51:16.640" style="s2">systematic thinking so i&#39;m going to try</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.520" end="00:51:19.839" style="s2">my my best here but</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.640" end="00:51:21.760" style="s2">so it seems clear that</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.839" end="00:51:23.359" style="s2">all three modalities which would say</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.760" end="00:51:25.440" style="s2">development in psalm</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.359" end="00:51:27.040" style="s2">transcendence that all three of them</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.440" end="00:51:30.800" style="s2">leave something like</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.040" end="00:51:34.720" style="s2">signatures within the physiology</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.800" end="00:51:36.000" style="s2">so the most obvious ones and you</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.720" end="00:51:37.680" style="s2">mentioned it in the domain of</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.000" end="00:51:39.920" style="s2">installment</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.680" end="00:51:40.800" style="s2">when you&#39;re looking at the way the image</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.920" end="00:51:44.319" style="s2">of self</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.800" end="00:51:45.680" style="s2">is actually written onto the biology of</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.319" end="00:51:49.040" style="s2">the body</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.680" end="00:51:52.160" style="s2">in gesture and habit body as i mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.040" end="00:51:53.040" style="s2">so real wilhemree called this the the</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.160" end="00:51:56.000" style="s2">armoring</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.040" end="00:51:57.119" style="s2">or the characterological armoring where</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.000" end="00:52:00.720" style="s2">you actually kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.119" end="00:52:03.839" style="s2">wear your habitual emotional</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.720" end="00:52:07.119" style="s2">habit body you end up wearing it</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.839" end="00:52:10.319" style="s2">in your in your physical form uh</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.119" end="00:52:14.319" style="s2">so that that&#39;s one place where</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.319" end="00:52:18.319" style="s2">the nature of movement practice</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.319" end="00:52:20.240" style="s2">and body work and as i was mentioning</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.319" end="00:52:22.559" style="s2">thinking reflectively about transforming</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.240" end="00:52:23.680" style="s2">your own habit body which is like</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.559" end="00:52:26.000" style="s2">changing the nature of your</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.680" end="00:52:29.200" style="s2">physiological armory that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.000" end="00:52:31.280" style="s2">came down from character structure uh</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.200" end="00:52:32.720" style="s2">that&#39;s all how that looks in the domain</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.280" end="00:52:36.480" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.720" end="00:52:36.480" style="s2">basically installment</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.640" end="00:52:44.079" style="s2">the transcendent however is where</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.480" end="00:52:47.359" style="s2">the basically</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.079" end="00:52:50.640" style="s2">body itself if i can say that</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.359" end="00:52:54.480" style="s2">lives like in</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.640" end="00:52:56.319" style="s2">development and capacity building you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.480" end="00:52:59.359" style="s2">using your body</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.319" end="00:53:02.800" style="s2">in ensoment you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.359" end="00:53:06.480" style="s2">have created an imaginal</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.800" end="00:53:07.520" style="s2">image of your body like hillman writes</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.480" end="00:53:10.240" style="s2">about this</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.520" end="00:53:11.599" style="s2">the alchemists write about it too they</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.240" end="00:53:13.680" style="s2">called it the imaginal</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.599" end="00:53:15.839" style="s2">ship of death which is to say you</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.680" end="00:53:19.119" style="s2">actually get out of your physical body</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.839" end="00:53:20.960" style="s2">you live in an imaginal image of your</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.119" end="00:53:22.640" style="s2">body</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.960" end="00:53:25.760" style="s2">but in the transcendent that&#39;s when you</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.640" end="00:53:29.040" style="s2">return to the actual</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.760" end="00:53:30.800" style="s2">blood and guts body and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.040" end="00:53:33.359" style="s2">it&#39;s in the transcendent in the dome in</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.800" end="00:53:36.720" style="s2">the domains of</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.359" end="00:53:40.480" style="s2">the symbolic immortality of being matter</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.720" end="00:53:43.680" style="s2">the symbolic immortality of being life</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.480" end="00:53:44.559" style="s2">right that i am continuous through my</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.680" end="00:53:47.680" style="s2">breathing</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.559" end="00:53:50.880" style="s2">and through the rhythm of my heart</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.680" end="00:53:51.760" style="s2">with all other living being things that</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.880" end="00:53:53.680" style="s2">takes place</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.760" end="00:53:55.040" style="s2">before all awareness before all</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.680" end="00:53:56.880" style="s2">consciousness at the level of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.040" end="00:54:00.079" style="s2">transcendent in the actual</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.880" end="00:54:02.640" style="s2">body so a lot of body work practice</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.079" end="00:54:04.160" style="s2">and yoga and meditation and things</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.640" end="00:54:05.920" style="s2">actually work on that dimension of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.160" end="00:54:09.280" style="s2">body where it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.920" end="00:54:12.559" style="s2">locating awareness and consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.280" end="00:54:15.040" style="s2">in the body as the body which is hugely</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.559" end="00:54:16.960" style="s2">important and massively curative</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.040" end="00:54:18.240" style="s2">uh and related to that notion of</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.960" end="00:54:20.000" style="s2">changing the habit</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.240" end="00:54:22.319" style="s2">body and the character structure the</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.000" end="00:54:24.960" style="s2">armoring and the reichen sense</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.319" end="00:54:27.040" style="s2">um and then it would be in the domain of</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.960" end="00:54:30.079" style="s2">development where you actually get a lot</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.040" end="00:54:32.240" style="s2">of mouth like this is where you can get</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.079" end="00:54:34.960" style="s2">the body used as an instrument where you</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.240" end="00:54:38.799" style="s2">get self-instrumentalization</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.960" end="00:54:41.599" style="s2">for the sake of capacity um</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.799" end="00:54:43.119" style="s2">and uh so in installment if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.599" end="00:54:44.240" style="s2">depressed you&#39;re gonna have depressive</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.119" end="00:54:46.319" style="s2">gestures and</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.240" end="00:54:47.680" style="s2">if you have an image of yourself that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.319" end="00:54:49.440" style="s2">you know triumphant you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.680" end="00:54:51.440" style="s2">walk with your chest puffed out and</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.440" end="00:54:52.799" style="s2">stuff like that in development it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.440" end="00:54:56.960" style="s2">like if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.799" end="00:55:00.240" style="s2">a physical laborer or a mathematician</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.960" end="00:55:04.400" style="s2">or a you know mother</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.240" end="00:55:07.599" style="s2">or a um you know finance guy</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.400" end="00:55:10.960" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna have different uh physio</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.599" end="00:55:13.920" style="s2">physio physio physiological</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.960" end="00:55:15.520" style="s2">signatures of the capacities you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.920" end="00:55:18.319" style="s2">developed</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.520" end="00:55:19.839" style="s2">so different than the image of self and</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.319" end="00:55:20.559" style="s2">the image of body and different from the</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.839" end="00:55:24.079" style="s2">body as</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.559" end="00:55:27.280" style="s2">such is the body as</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.079" end="00:55:29.839" style="s2">instrument tool um so think about an</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.280" end="00:55:34.720" style="s2">athlete&#39;s body or a musician&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.839" end="00:55:36.079" style="s2">hands right that their changed and</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.720" end="00:55:39.839" style="s2">strengthened</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.079" end="00:55:43.359" style="s2">um as a result of the active</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.839" end="00:55:45.200" style="s2">capacity development um so</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.359" end="00:55:46.400" style="s2">and again it&#39;s like remember all three</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.200" end="00:55:47.280" style="s2">of them are being heuristically</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.400" end="00:55:50.720" style="s2">differentiated</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.280" end="00:55:51.520" style="s2">but in every psychic event all three</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.720" end="00:55:53.280" style="s2">occur</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.520" end="00:55:55.040" style="s2">so like when the athlete&#39;s exercising</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.280" end="00:55:56.400" style="s2">the athletes exercising the image of</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.040" end="00:55:58.000" style="s2">self</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.400" end="00:56:00.720" style="s2">making choice through the transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.000" end="00:56:04.880" style="s2">and also building capacity</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.720" end="00:56:06.079" style="s2">so it&#39;s just that uh yes a body&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.880" end="00:56:09.200" style="s2">always involved</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.079" end="00:56:12.319" style="s2">um and i think you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.200" end="00:56:16.799" style="s2">a lot of what i&#39;m seeing when i work</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.319" end="00:56:20.319" style="s2">as a psychologist i read gesture and</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.799" end="00:56:22.240" style="s2">habit body and i&#39;m curious about</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.319" end="00:56:24.720" style="s2">you know the way the image of who they</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.240" end="00:56:27.680" style="s2">are they&#39;re wearing</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.720" end="00:56:28.799" style="s2">and then about the kind of forms of</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.680" end="00:56:30.559" style="s2">gesture</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.799" end="00:56:32.559" style="s2">and forms of posture and other things</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.559" end="00:56:36.000" style="s2">that signal to me capacity</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.559" end="00:56:36.720" style="s2">has been acquired and then also just</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.000" end="00:56:37.839" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.720" end="00:56:39.839" style="s2">where is their awareness and</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.839" end="00:56:43.200" style="s2">consciousness are they even</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.839" end="00:56:46.079" style="s2">can they rest as the</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.200" end="00:56:47.520" style="s2">right body as aware of the body as such</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.079" end="00:56:50.160" style="s2">you can detect those things</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.520" end="00:56:51.839" style="s2">almost by watching someone uh and</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.160" end="00:56:52.480" style="s2">listening to them speak for a little</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.839" end="00:56:54.079" style="s2">while</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.480" end="00:56:55.920" style="s2">you can tell how much is their body</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.079" end="00:56:57.599" style="s2">being used as an instrument or a</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.920" end="00:56:59.760" style="s2">particular capacity</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.599" end="00:57:01.040" style="s2">how much has their body been basically</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.760" end="00:57:04.960" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.040" end="00:57:06.160" style="s2">you know shaped by this image of self</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.960" end="00:57:08.400" style="s2">and then how much are they actually</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.160" end="00:57:08.880" style="s2">aware of their body as that they are a</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.400" end="00:57:12.000" style="s2">body</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.880" end="00:57:12.799" style="s2">it can be as their body so that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.000" end="00:57:15.040" style="s2">first pass</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.799" end="00:57:17.119" style="s2">um i&#39;m not sure if any of that is</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.040" end="00:57:19.359" style="s2">correct but we will</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.119" end="00:57:20.559" style="s2">have to see as i think more about how</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.359" end="00:57:22.079" style="s2">embodiment</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.559" end="00:57:23.760" style="s2">basically it&#39;s like embodiments to the</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.079" end="00:57:24.720" style="s2">category that applies across all three</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.760" end="00:57:27.760" style="s2">modalities</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.720" end="00:57:29.680" style="s2">basically is what i&#39;m saying um and so</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.760" end="00:57:32.319" style="s2">it might be helpful to think about</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.680" end="00:57:34.000" style="s2">embodiment from those three perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.319" end="00:57:35.839" style="s2">and different signatures you&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.000" end="00:57:37.599" style="s2">in the body</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.839" end="00:57:39.040" style="s2">and things that the body does and</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.599" end="00:57:41.040" style="s2">proclivities of the body is being</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.040" end="00:57:43.200" style="s2">related to those three somehow</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.040" end="00:57:44.079" style="s2">rather than vitamin being in like one of</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.200" end="00:57:46.240" style="s2">the three</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.079" end="00:57:46.240" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.760" end="00:57:56.880" style="s2">conor you had a question</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.400" end="00:57:57.680" style="s2">yeah exactly this is great um so i was</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.880" end="00:58:00.720" style="s2">wondering what</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.680" end="00:58:01.040" style="s2">advice would you have for enriching a</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.720" end="00:58:03.680" style="s2">new</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.040" end="00:58:05.520" style="s2">installment station or just for</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.680" end="00:58:08.319" style="s2">transitioning from transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.520" end="00:58:09.839" style="s2">to installment like what practices would</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.319" end="00:58:12.799" style="s2">you recommend if any</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.839" end="00:58:13.200" style="s2">especially if after a phase transition</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.799" end="00:58:15.280" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.200" end="00:58:17.040" style="s2">through transcendence the perception of</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.280" end="00:58:20.160" style="s2">next and soulman station</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.040" end="00:58:23.119" style="s2">somehow feels unviable or like too big</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.160" end="00:58:25.440" style="s2">uh and then like related what potential</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.119" end="00:58:28.240" style="s2">pitfalls are likely to cause a skip</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.440" end="00:58:29.920" style="s2">of insolent um going out of the proper</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.240" end="00:58:31.599" style="s2">axiom two sequence</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.920" end="00:58:33.200" style="s2">uh directly from transcendence to</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.599" end="00:58:37.839" style="s2">development in our era</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.200" end="00:58:37.839" style="s2">assuming that&#39;s even possible or common</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.480" end="00:58:41.680" style="s2">well that was a great question i was</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.119" end="00:58:43.680" style="s2">excited</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.680" end="00:58:46.640" style="s2">to hear my own terminology used back at</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.680" end="00:58:48.960" style="s2">me uh</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.640" end="00:58:50.000" style="s2">yeah so you said a couple things that i</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.960" end="00:58:51.440" style="s2">want to pull out because i think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.000" end="00:58:53.280" style="s2">interesting and very</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.440" end="00:58:54.880" style="s2">um important because it&#39;s a general</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.280" end="00:58:57.200" style="s2">thing so you mentioned that</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.880" end="00:58:59.599" style="s2">through certain dynamics that took place</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.200" end="00:59:01.119" style="s2">in phase shifts in the transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.599" end="00:59:02.960" style="s2">you were then thrown back into a</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.119" end="00:59:04.000" style="s2">position of insolent where the image of</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.960" end="00:59:07.119" style="s2">self you are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.000" end="00:59:09.119" style="s2">integrate was too big or seemed not</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.119" end="00:59:11.040" style="s2">feasible is that right did i get that</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.119" end="00:59:14.079" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.040" end="00:59:17.359" style="s2">yeah right exactly and this is</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.079" end="00:59:18.160" style="s2">and this is super common like this is</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.359" end="00:59:21.119" style="s2">one of the main</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.160" end="00:59:21.760" style="s2">things that one finds when you look at</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.119" end="00:59:25.040" style="s2">research</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.760" end="00:59:26.640" style="s2">in uh psychedelics and meditation and</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.040" end="00:59:29.200" style="s2">specifically meditation traditions that</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.640" end="00:59:32.400" style="s2">are like empowerment traditions</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.200" end="00:59:34.880" style="s2">uh is that the</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.400" end="00:59:36.160" style="s2">kind of download as it were from the</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.880" end="00:59:38.240" style="s2">transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.160" end="00:59:39.359" style="s2">and the kind of dynamics of symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.240" end="00:59:43.520" style="s2">immortality that got</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.359" end="00:59:46.480" style="s2">cooked in samadhi or satori or</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.520" end="00:59:48.880" style="s2">ayahuasca or something ended up landing</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.480" end="00:59:52.559" style="s2">you back in the world quote unquote</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.880" end="00:59:54.799" style="s2">uh with a for lack of a better phrase</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.559" end="00:59:58.480" style="s2">grandiose image of self</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.799" end="01:00:02.480" style="s2">all right um and uh</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.480" end="01:00:03.440" style="s2">and so that&#39;s one of the things that i</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.480" end="01:00:07.200" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.440" end="01:00:10.240" style="s2">is so powerful about</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.200" end="01:00:10.799" style="s2">the dynamics of symbolic immortality is</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.240" end="01:00:14.599" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.799" end="01:00:18.000" style="s2">they actually do reposition the</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.599" end="01:00:20.319" style="s2">potentialities for new</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.000" end="01:00:21.760" style="s2">basically stations of installment so</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.319" end="01:00:23.839" style="s2">this is your question and it&#39;s like i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.760" end="01:00:25.680" style="s2">been empowered through some transcendent</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.839" end="01:00:27.520" style="s2">experience and now i feel like i&#39;m at</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.680" end="01:00:30.720" style="s2">the doorway</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.520" end="01:00:31.520" style="s2">of certain stations of installment that</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.720" end="01:00:33.310" style="s2">are like</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.520" end="01:00:34.799" style="s2">like whoa i didn&#39;t sign up for this</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.310" end="01:00:37.440" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.799" end="01:00:39.119" style="s2">like this seems like a much bigger uh</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.440" end="01:00:40.319" style="s2">couple things i have to go through so</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.119" end="01:00:41.920" style="s2">so that&#39;s when i&#39;m gonna pull out and</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.319" end="01:00:42.880" style="s2">see two a little bit and i think that</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.920" end="01:00:44.960" style="s2">this is a very</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.880" end="01:00:46.319" style="s2">uh important question because i think</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.960" end="01:00:49.040" style="s2">many people</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.319" end="01:00:50.799" style="s2">experience this and it doesn&#39;t only</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.040" end="01:00:52.480" style="s2">necessarily come from</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.799" end="01:00:54.480" style="s2">meditative experiences or drug</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.480" end="01:00:57.280" style="s2">experiences or something</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.480" end="01:00:58.640" style="s2">if you behave a certain way create a</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.280" end="01:01:01.440" style="s2">certain artifact</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.640" end="01:01:03.040" style="s2">make certain choices you can end up</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.440" end="01:01:04.960" style="s2">putting yourself in a position where</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.040" end="01:01:07.920" style="s2">you&#39;re at the beginning of a path</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.960" end="01:01:08.400" style="s2">of installment that seems way steeper</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.920" end="01:01:11.440" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.400" end="01:01:13.839" style="s2">way bigger than you ever thought so</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.440" end="01:01:15.359" style="s2">totally love it and this is like one of</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.839" end="01:01:17.359" style="s2">the things we need to learn to work with</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.359" end="01:01:19.440" style="s2">this is what religion used to give us</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.359" end="01:01:24.240" style="s2">was both the empowerment</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.440" end="01:01:27.440" style="s2">and the humility to start at</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.240" end="01:01:29.520" style="s2">station one instead of</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.440" end="01:01:31.839" style="s2">coming out being re-empowered having the</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.520" end="01:01:34.079" style="s2">vision of the new self that&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.839" end="01:01:35.520" style="s2">and imagining you&#39;re already there right</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.079" end="01:01:36.559" style="s2">so that&#39;s the first thing to note which</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.520" end="01:01:39.359" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.559" end="01:01:40.079" style="s2">if you&#39;re if you&#39;re through transcendent</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.359" end="01:01:42.160" style="s2">insight</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.079" end="01:01:44.160" style="s2">have the door open to a new set of</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.160" end="01:01:47.359" style="s2">stations for installment</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.160" end="01:01:47.920" style="s2">uh you need to figure out where your</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.359" end="01:01:52.240" style="s2">first</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.920" end="01:01:55.280" style="s2">step is right and that&#39;s often usually</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.240" end="01:02:00.480" style="s2">something more like a massive</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.280" end="01:02:00.480" style="s2">humbling or a uh</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.559" end="01:02:04.160" style="s2">like a dark knight of the soul kind of</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.880" end="01:02:05.359" style="s2">thing right</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.160" end="01:02:08.960" style="s2">so you come out and you&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.359" end="01:02:12.480" style="s2">equivalent of that uh</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.960" end="01:02:14.000" style="s2">fusion with the symbolic immortality</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.480" end="01:02:17.280" style="s2">right so this is the equivalent of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.000" end="01:02:18.640" style="s2">pre-tragic where there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.280" end="01:02:20.960" style="s2">there doesn&#39;t seem to be any split</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.640" end="01:02:24.079" style="s2">between you and this</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.960" end="01:02:26.319" style="s2">imaginal image of a future world</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.079" end="01:02:28.240" style="s2">in which you&#39;re the self is now like</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.319" end="01:02:29.599" style="s2">co-located with all of these incredible</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.240" end="01:02:31.359" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.599" end="01:02:33.839" style="s2">so you&#39;re kind of fused with the image</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.359" end="01:02:38.240" style="s2">the first step is getting out of fusion</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.839" end="01:02:40.799" style="s2">into separation distance criticism</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.240" end="01:02:42.079" style="s2">of that new image so this is like the</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.799" end="01:02:43.280" style="s2">tragic where all of a sudden there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.079" end="01:02:46.160" style="s2">interruption</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.280" end="01:02:47.920" style="s2">to that simple thing so this is the</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.160" end="01:02:49.200" style="s2">first thing you need to do is figure out</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.920" end="01:02:53.200" style="s2">how to get</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.200" end="01:02:54.160" style="s2">distance from that modality of symbolic</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.200" end="01:02:58.079" style="s2">immortality</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.160" end="01:03:01.440" style="s2">to criticize it uh only after that</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.079" end="01:03:04.720" style="s2">and probably traversing quite a lot</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.440" end="01:03:07.760" style="s2">can you move into some form of sweetness</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.720" end="01:03:08.880" style="s2">or reintegration with that image which</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.760" end="01:03:12.319" style="s2">has been</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.880" end="01:03:15.119" style="s2">refined and put through</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.319" end="01:03:16.160" style="s2">the kind of fire of realism and</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.119" end="01:03:17.920" style="s2">criticism</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.160" end="01:03:20.319" style="s2">so that&#39;s kind of the modality it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.920" end="01:03:24.559" style="s2">you first come out and you&#39;re like holy</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.319" end="01:03:27.200" style="s2">cow like i just got told that i need</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.559" end="01:03:29.599" style="s2">to be this person xyz that means that i</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.200" end="01:03:33.119" style="s2">already kind of aim this person</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.599" end="01:03:34.480" style="s2">xyz and then you need to be like no</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.119" end="01:03:36.640" style="s2">you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.480" end="01:03:38.000" style="s2">you&#39;re not that person you could be</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.640" end="01:03:41.680" style="s2">right what is</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.000" end="01:03:43.359" style="s2">the kind of like ecstatic ordeal</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.680" end="01:03:45.359" style="s2">that one needs to go through to</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.359" end="01:03:48.640" style="s2">transform to be able to become that</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.359" end="01:03:50.640" style="s2">person or to become some version of that</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.640" end="01:03:52.960" style="s2">which has been refined through that</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.640" end="01:03:56.000" style="s2">through that ordeal</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.960" end="01:03:58.960" style="s2">so so it&#39;s not so much saying like</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.000" end="01:04:00.400" style="s2">you know yeah all that shit&#39;s [ __ ]</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.960" end="01:04:01.680" style="s2">and you&#39;re now you&#39;re just a grandiose</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.400" end="01:04:04.319" style="s2">personality and if you do</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.680" end="01:04:06.559" style="s2">ayahuasca too much you&#39;ll just become a</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.319" end="01:04:08.559" style="s2">narcissist and a selfish person that</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.559" end="01:04:10.640" style="s2">you know that can&#39;t happen but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.559" end="01:04:12.319" style="s2">that you&#39;ve just placed before yourself</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.640" end="01:04:15.920" style="s2">a tremendous kind of</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.319" end="01:04:18.160" style="s2">journey of learning and transformation</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.920" end="01:04:19.599" style="s2">so as opposed to having kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.160" end="01:04:22.880" style="s2">accomplished it</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.599" end="01:04:25.359" style="s2">by symbolizing the immortality you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.880" end="01:04:27.760" style="s2">actually just started it</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.359" end="01:04:29.520" style="s2">is the idea and the images of</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.760" end="01:04:31.200" style="s2">self-remember are created by the soul so</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.520" end="01:04:33.520" style="s2">the images of self that you&#39;re pulling</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.200" end="01:04:36.400" style="s2">out of that symbolic immortality</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.520" end="01:04:37.839" style="s2">uh you know does not necessarily need to</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.400" end="01:04:38.559" style="s2">be something you can accomplish in this</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.839" end="01:04:41.680" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.559" end="01:04:42.880" style="s2">right like the soul pulls images from</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.680" end="01:04:46.720" style="s2">deep</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.880" end="01:04:49.920" style="s2">um so uh it&#39;s worth noting that</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.720" end="01:04:52.640" style="s2">as you separate from that</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.920" end="01:04:53.119" style="s2">form of symbolic immortality and bring</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.640" end="01:04:55.760" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.119" end="01:04:57.280" style="s2">new image itself in line with existing</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.760" end="01:04:59.200" style="s2">conditions you may realize that yeah</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.280" end="01:05:02.640" style="s2">this is actually a</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.200" end="01:05:06.079" style="s2">a soul image that is</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.640" end="01:05:09.839" style="s2">operating across uh</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.079" end="01:05:13.280" style="s2">across dimensionalities rather than</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.839" end="01:05:14.480" style="s2">being a specific earthly request</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.280" end="01:05:16.480" style="s2">so i&#39;m getting a little bit out there</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.480" end="01:05:18.319" style="s2">but this comes from steiner and</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.480" end="01:05:20.319" style="s2">other traditions that actually grapple</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.319" end="01:05:22.240" style="s2">with this dynamic of transcendence and</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.319" end="01:05:23.920" style="s2">insolent um</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.240" end="01:05:25.680" style="s2">and what you find there again and this</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.920" end="01:05:27.440" style="s2">is again the risk of</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.680" end="01:05:29.200" style="s2">certain forms of psychedelics is that</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.440" end="01:05:32.960" style="s2">you&#39;re pulling down images</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.200" end="01:05:34.240" style="s2">from other realms man like and then to</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.960" end="01:05:36.720" style="s2">think that they&#39;re actually relevant</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.240" end="01:05:38.000" style="s2">here on this earth and this time</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.720" end="01:05:39.680" style="s2">that&#39;s where you can get the grandiose</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.000" end="01:05:40.799" style="s2">personality stuff it&#39;s not that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.680" end="01:05:43.839" style="s2">not real</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.799" end="01:05:48.480" style="s2">it&#39;s that the soul&#39;s plugged in across</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.839" end="01:05:50.799" style="s2">uh multiple lifetimes</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.480" end="01:05:51.680" style="s2">so all right now i&#39;m getting out there</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.799" end="01:05:54.880" style="s2">into some</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.680" end="01:05:57.039" style="s2">ontologically treacherous water so</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.880" end="01:05:58.720" style="s2">so yeah so that&#39;s me kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.039" end="01:05:59.680" style="s2">theorizing into that space i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.720" end="01:06:01.920" style="s2">a wonderful</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.680" end="01:06:04.400" style="s2">question so the basic answer is like</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.920" end="01:06:07.200" style="s2">yeah totally you are that person</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.400" end="01:06:09.359" style="s2">but you need to get yourself into a</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.200" end="01:06:13.359" style="s2">situation to take that first step</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.359" end="01:06:14.880" style="s2">out of the the unity into the separation</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.359" end="01:06:17.680" style="s2">criticism</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.880" end="01:06:18.000" style="s2">work so burn that image in the fire and</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.680" end="01:06:21.839" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.000" end="01:06:21.839" style="s2">see what comes out on the other side</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.760" end="01:06:26.799" style="s2">thank you so we have another question</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.599" end="01:06:29.599" style="s2">from ben</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.799" end="01:06:29.599" style="s2">do you want to meet yourself</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.880" end="01:06:34.240" style="s2">thanks i&#39;m not sure whether this is a</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.319" end="01:06:35.359" style="s2">how-to question or do you have further</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.240" end="01:06:38.319" style="s2">examples but</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.359" end="01:06:40.079" style="s2">um something like so you know working</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.319" end="01:06:43.200" style="s2">with oneself or in oneself or</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.079" end="01:06:46.240" style="s2">with others in small groups how do you</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.200" end="01:06:48.240" style="s2">recognize okay well um you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.240" end="01:06:49.599" style="s2">the modality which we should be working</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.240" end="01:06:52.319" style="s2">with here is</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.599" end="01:06:53.839" style="s2">um which one and how how to move between</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.319" end="01:06:57.039" style="s2">modalities</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.839" end="01:07:00.400" style="s2">and as an extension to that um</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.039" end="01:07:02.400" style="s2">in in dyads or in small groups um</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.400" end="01:07:03.599" style="s2">what is the dynamic or is there a</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.400" end="01:07:07.599" style="s2">dynamic you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.599" end="01:07:09.680" style="s2">could for example one person be</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.599" end="01:07:11.119" style="s2">working in one modality and the other</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.680" end="01:07:12.559" style="s2">working in a different modality how do</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.119" end="01:07:16.079" style="s2">you how do you see that</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.559" end="01:07:16.079" style="s2">or is there necessarily a congruence</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.960" end="01:07:20.960" style="s2">this is exciting man i&#39;m loving this</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.280" end="01:07:22.880" style="s2">because it&#39;s like i&#39;ve not just thought</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.960" end="01:07:25.440" style="s2">this stuff through and so you guys are</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.880" end="01:07:26.960" style="s2">giving me my own vocabulary back to me</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.440" end="01:07:29.920" style="s2">and so i&#39;m having ideas which i&#39;ve not</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.960" end="01:07:31.680" style="s2">had before so one of them is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.920" end="01:07:34.640" style="s2">definitely the case that</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.680" end="01:07:36.480" style="s2">there are personality types or character</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.640" end="01:07:38.799" style="s2">structures that orient to</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.480" end="01:07:40.400" style="s2">one of the three modalities right so</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.799" end="01:07:42.640" style="s2">that you could get a group of people</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.400" end="01:07:45.200" style="s2">where it&#39;s like oh that guy&#39;s handling</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.640" end="01:07:47.760" style="s2">the language and the cognition capacity</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.200" end="01:07:49.599" style="s2">she&#39;s handling the installment</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.760" end="01:07:51.119" style="s2">and you know she&#39;s handling the</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.599" end="01:07:52.400" style="s2">transcendence like you could get a group</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.119" end="01:07:53.920" style="s2">like that where you actually get a</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.400" end="01:07:56.000" style="s2">division of labor</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.920" end="01:07:57.280" style="s2">and the personality type for lack of a</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.000" end="01:07:59.599" style="s2">better phrase</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.280" end="01:08:01.280" style="s2">or rather the archetypal kind of image</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.599" end="01:08:02.559" style="s2">of that person has them constellating</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.280" end="01:08:05.200" style="s2">around that so i think</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.559" end="01:08:06.319" style="s2">i think there&#39;s something true in there</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.200" end="01:08:07.359" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.319" end="01:08:09.520" style="s2">you have to take that with a grain of</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.359" end="01:08:12.000" style="s2">salt because clearly</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.520" end="01:08:13.200" style="s2">the culture and the institutions and the</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.000" end="01:08:15.920" style="s2">schools</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.200" end="01:08:17.120" style="s2">and other things are tipping the balance</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.920" end="01:08:19.440" style="s2">in favor of</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.120" end="01:08:21.279" style="s2">some people being some ways as opposed</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.440" end="01:08:23.199" style="s2">to others</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.279" end="01:08:26.159" style="s2">so i think there&#39;s a as we talked about</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.199" end="01:08:26.159" style="s2">last time with the question</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.199" end="01:08:31.040" style="s2">we&#39;ve skewed heavily towards the</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.880" end="01:08:33.520" style="s2">linguistic and the cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.040" end="01:08:35.440" style="s2">um to the extent that when we move in</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.520" end="01:08:38.640" style="s2">the domains of the transcendent</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.440" end="01:08:39.920" style="s2">and insolent we become either fetishized</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.640" end="01:08:42.960" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.920" end="01:08:44.640" style="s2">traumatized and et cetera so i think one</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.960" end="01:08:45.839" style="s2">of the things we&#39;re looking for and this</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.640" end="01:08:46.960" style="s2">gets the other part of your question</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.839" end="01:08:49.520" style="s2">diagnostically</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.960" end="01:08:50.080" style="s2">one of the things we&#39;re looking for is</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.520" end="01:08:53.440" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.080" end="01:08:54.080" style="s2">are people leaning from i&#39;m back to like</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.440" end="01:08:57.359" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.080" end="01:08:57.839" style="s2">language of gesture so a lot of what you</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.359" end="01:09:01.199" style="s2">end up</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.839" end="01:09:04.880" style="s2">seeing is uh the</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.199" end="01:09:08.319" style="s2">basically malformation of uh</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.880" end="01:09:09.920" style="s2">expression um because of cultural and</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.319" end="01:09:12.960" style="s2">societal impulse</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.920" end="01:09:14.719" style="s2">so you have to actually disengage</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.960" end="01:09:16.640" style="s2">i&#39;m getting like very diagnostic now as</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.719" end="01:09:18.560" style="s2">like a psychotherapist would disengage</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.640" end="01:09:19.600" style="s2">from the content of what someone is</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.560" end="01:09:20.799" style="s2">saying</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.600" end="01:09:22.560" style="s2">right if you&#39;re trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.799" end="01:09:24.159" style="s2">okay this person&#39;s hurting this person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.560" end="01:09:26.799" style="s2">coming to me they&#39;re seeking help</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.159" end="01:09:27.839" style="s2">right i want to be able to give them</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.799" end="01:09:29.440" style="s2">advice</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.839" end="01:09:31.279" style="s2">about whether they need to work on these</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.440" end="01:09:31.759" style="s2">issues of installment or they need to</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.279" end="01:09:33.839" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.759" end="01:09:35.359" style="s2">build some cognitive apparatus and skill</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.839" end="01:09:36.719" style="s2">capacity or if they need to actually</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.359" end="01:09:38.400" style="s2">meditate and</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.719" end="01:09:40.719" style="s2">uh you know get a spiritual teacher or</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.400" end="01:09:41.600" style="s2">something so what i would do is i would</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.719" end="01:09:43.199" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.600" end="01:09:45.759" style="s2">disengage from the content of what</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.199" end="01:09:49.359" style="s2">they&#39;re telling you</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.759" end="01:09:52.719" style="s2">and listen to literally the</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.359" end="01:09:54.400" style="s2">relationship between the emotion of</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.719" end="01:09:57.280" style="s2">their voice</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.400" end="01:09:58.880" style="s2">and that content and the gestures and</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.280" end="01:09:59.679" style="s2">habits of their body while they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.880" end="01:10:01.280" style="s2">speaking</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.679" end="01:10:03.360" style="s2">and that content so what you&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.280" end="01:10:07.840" style="s2">for specifically is</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.360" end="01:10:11.520" style="s2">the uh the cue towards</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.840" end="01:10:14.719" style="s2">symbolic language imagistic language</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.520" end="01:10:17.360" style="s2">or cognitive language right</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.719" end="01:10:18.320" style="s2">and then the emotional resonance that</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.360" end="01:10:22.400" style="s2">each of those</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.320" end="01:10:24.640" style="s2">has right like um</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.400" end="01:10:27.040" style="s2">when people describe to you their</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.640" end="01:10:28.159" style="s2">problem or if they describe to you even</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.040" end="01:10:31.520" style="s2">their</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.159" end="01:10:33.840" style="s2">life and the situations that they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.520" end="01:10:35.679" style="s2">there will be a waiting towards those</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.840" end="01:10:37.040" style="s2">kinds of languages</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.679" end="01:10:39.760" style="s2">all right there will be a waiting</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.040" end="01:10:40.480" style="s2">towards either cognitive language spoken</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.760" end="01:10:43.600" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.480" end="01:10:44.000" style="s2">emotional distance or imagistic language</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.600" end="01:10:47.120" style="s2">spoken</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.000" end="01:10:48.800" style="s2">with emotional intensity or symbolic</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.120" end="01:10:50.560" style="s2">transcendent language again probably</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.800" end="01:10:53.520" style="s2">spoken with emotional distance</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.560" end="01:10:54.960" style="s2">right so that&#39;s just an example but</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.520" end="01:10:58.080" style="s2">let&#39;s say someone</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.960" end="01:11:00.080" style="s2">is trying to explain to you their life</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.080" end="01:11:01.280" style="s2">but it&#39;s really too actual complicated</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.080" end="01:11:03.280" style="s2">for them to explain to you so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.280" end="01:11:03.840" style="s2">trying to use cognitive language and now</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.280" end="01:11:05.920" style="s2">they&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.840" end="01:11:07.280" style="s2">really emotional trying to use cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.920" end="01:11:08.400" style="s2">language makes you think they actually</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.280" end="01:11:10.840" style="s2">don&#39;t understand what the hell is going</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.400" end="01:11:15.040" style="s2">on in their life</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.840" end="01:11:17.199" style="s2">um or they&#39;re describing to you an image</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.040" end="01:11:18.640" style="s2">like of their professional job and who</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.199" end="01:11:19.440" style="s2">they&#39;re going to become and they sound</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.640" end="01:11:22.320" style="s2">completely not</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.440" end="01:11:24.000" style="s2">enthusiastic all right so who cares what</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.320" end="01:11:25.520" style="s2">their what the image is</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.000" end="01:11:27.360" style="s2">the fact that they&#39;re describing an</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.520" end="01:11:29.840" style="s2">image of their future self</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.360" end="01:11:31.840" style="s2">and they&#39;re not enthusiastic at all</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.840" end="01:11:33.760" style="s2">means that they probably need to do some</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.840" end="01:11:37.280" style="s2">work in the domain of installment</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.760" end="01:11:39.040" style="s2">to clarify the image of self right</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.280" end="01:11:40.480" style="s2">so that&#39;s just two examples of like what</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.040" end="01:11:41.840" style="s2">you&#39;re looking for it&#39;s like which</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.480" end="01:11:44.239" style="s2">modality are they like</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.840" end="01:11:45.040" style="s2">speaking from an in and then what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.239" end="01:11:46.480" style="s2">tone and</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.040" end="01:11:49.840" style="s2">resonance of their body and their</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.480" end="01:11:53.040" style="s2">emotion as they&#39;re speaking this way</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.840" end="01:11:54.719" style="s2">and you know i find this to be very very</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.040" end="01:11:57.760" style="s2">useful um</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.719" end="01:11:59.600" style="s2">and if someone is for example speaking</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.760" end="01:12:00.159" style="s2">in a very emotional way about something</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.600" end="01:12:02.159" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.159" end="01:12:03.360" style="s2">could just be a description from a</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.159" end="01:12:05.120" style="s2">cognitive perspective</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.360" end="01:12:07.760" style="s2">like their relationships and their</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.120" end="01:12:10.640" style="s2">family and things of that nature</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.760" end="01:12:12.480" style="s2">sometimes you need to invite them into</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.640" end="01:12:15.760" style="s2">imogistic language</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.480" end="01:12:18.480" style="s2">right ask them to give you a metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.760" end="01:12:20.640" style="s2">or an image that encapsulates this thing</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.480" end="01:12:23.679" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to describe cognitively</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.640" end="01:12:25.760" style="s2">and see if they can do that or not</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.679" end="01:12:27.679" style="s2">sometimes that alone will be massively</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.760" end="01:12:30.000" style="s2">helpful</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.679" end="01:12:31.040" style="s2">sometimes actually helping people do</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.000" end="01:12:33.360" style="s2">that to move</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.040" end="01:12:35.040" style="s2">from the linguistic and cognitive into</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.360" end="01:12:37.360" style="s2">the imagistic</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.040" end="01:12:38.960" style="s2">can be very helpful and similarly if</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.360" end="01:12:43.360" style="s2">someone is</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.960" end="01:12:47.040" style="s2">overwhelmed by image and they keep uh</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.360" end="01:12:49.920" style="s2">essentially you know describing these</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.040" end="01:12:51.520" style="s2">scenes these like poignant heartbreaking</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.920" end="01:12:54.800" style="s2">scenes from their life</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.520" end="01:12:56.320" style="s2">which they can&#39;t metabolize</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.800" end="01:12:57.920" style="s2">you can help them by getting them to</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.320" end="01:12:59.920" style="s2">speak symbolically</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.920" end="01:13:02.320" style="s2">right you can help them with the</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.920" end="01:13:04.480" style="s2">symbolic immortality construction</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.320" end="01:13:06.320" style="s2">get them to see you know that this is a</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.480" end="01:13:09.360" style="s2">dynamic involving</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.320" end="01:13:12.560" style="s2">mothers and motherhood or</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.360" end="01:13:14.719" style="s2">suffering and nothingness</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.560" end="01:13:16.640" style="s2">or whatever the thing is that&#39;s so deep</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.719" end="01:13:19.920" style="s2">that they can&#39;t resolve the image</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.640" end="01:13:22.400" style="s2">right so moving helping people move</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.920" end="01:13:24.159" style="s2">between the modalities is very useful</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.400" end="01:13:25.600" style="s2">therapeutic modality and also gives you</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.159" end="01:13:27.520" style="s2">a sense of</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.600" end="01:13:29.600" style="s2">which modality you then get the most</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.520" end="01:13:30.960" style="s2">help in right</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.600" end="01:13:32.239" style="s2">like i said sometimes if people are</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.960" end="01:13:32.719" style="s2">overwhelmed by the complexity of their</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.239" end="01:13:33.920" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.719" end="01:13:35.360" style="s2">they&#39;ll switch out of trying to</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.920" end="01:13:37.440" style="s2">understand it and they&#39;ll give it to you</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.360" end="01:13:38.960" style="s2">in some simple metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.440" end="01:13:41.280" style="s2">and you&#39;re like okay that&#39;s a that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.960" end="01:13:44.080" style="s2">too easy image</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.280" end="01:13:44.960" style="s2">uh can we shift from the image to</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.080" end="01:13:47.040" style="s2">language</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.960" end="01:13:48.480" style="s2">tell me more tell me a lot more oh</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.040" end="01:13:49.199" style="s2">you&#39;re actually confused about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.480" end="01:13:52.880" style="s2">going on</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.199" end="01:13:54.800" style="s2">you need work in building social skills</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.880" end="01:13:56.159" style="s2">and reflection techniques and things of</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.800" end="01:13:58.480" style="s2">that nature</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.159" end="01:14:00.400" style="s2">so so that&#39;s a little bit of like</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.480" end="01:14:01.440" style="s2">freestyling into the nature of that</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.400" end="01:14:04.800" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.440" end="01:14:07.120" style="s2">which is a very good one but uh</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.800" end="01:14:08.880" style="s2">you know i haven&#39;t had enough experience</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.120" end="01:14:12.239" style="s2">myself or with other</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.880" end="01:14:15.360" style="s2">practitioners clinicians to really know</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.239" end="01:14:16.719" style="s2">how it would hash out in terms of these</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.360" end="01:14:18.320" style="s2">kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.719" end="01:14:20.159" style="s2">practices so that&#39;s that&#39;s work that</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.320" end="01:14:21.920" style="s2">needs to be done but that was an initial</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.159" end="01:14:25.120" style="s2">first pass so hopefully that was</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.920" end="01:14:25.120" style="s2">illuminating a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.520" end="01:14:32.239" style="s2">okay so we have a question from bonita</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.239" end="01:14:35.280" style="s2">and i&#39;ll read it for her</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.239" end="01:14:36.480" style="s2">so do you have any um</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.280" end="01:14:38.480" style="s2">would you be able to recommend any</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.480" end="01:14:41.040" style="s2">authors or literature artists or</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.480" end="01:14:44.080" style="s2">teachers whose work is primarily focused</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.040" end="01:14:44.080" style="s2">on the post tragic</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.840" end="01:14:48.080" style="s2">huh</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.239" end="01:14:54.719" style="s2">and the one that came to mind first was</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.960" end="01:14:57.760" style="s2">the classic you know victor</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.719" end="01:14:59.040" style="s2">frankel right man search for meaning i</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.760" end="01:15:00.000" style="s2">think is one of the one of the more</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.040" end="01:15:04.000" style="s2">classic</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.000" end="01:15:08.960" style="s2">post-tragic texts um</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.000" end="01:15:12.800" style="s2">you know the truth is that</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.960" end="01:15:16.320" style="s2">most mature literature</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.800" end="01:15:18.320" style="s2">and philosophy is post-tragic</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.320" end="01:15:19.440" style="s2">this is one of the things that some of</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.320" end="01:15:21.280" style="s2">the qualities that</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.440" end="01:15:23.040" style="s2">we&#39;re actually honing in on when we call</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.280" end="01:15:26.159" style="s2">something mature</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.040" end="01:15:28.400" style="s2">or sophisticated um that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.159" end="01:15:30.719" style="s2">necessarily mean that it is</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.400" end="01:15:32.480" style="s2">really developed hierarchically complex</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.719" end="01:15:33.199" style="s2">right you can actually get very simple</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.480" end="01:15:37.199" style="s2">artistic</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.199" end="01:15:40.640" style="s2">products poetry and other things um</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.199" end="01:15:43.360" style="s2">uh mary oliver i think is an example of</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.640" end="01:15:44.320" style="s2">post-tragic many people read her as</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.360" end="01:15:46.080" style="s2">pre-tragic</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.320" end="01:15:47.920" style="s2">but if you know anything about her life</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.080" end="01:15:50.960" style="s2">you actually realize that mary oliver&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.920" end="01:15:51.440" style="s2">is post-tragic um and it&#39;s not because</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.960" end="01:15:55.600" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.440" end="01:15:57.040" style="s2">um complicate complicated and</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.600" end="01:15:58.239" style="s2">hierarchically complex from a</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.040" end="01:16:01.280" style="s2">developmental perspective</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.239" end="01:16:02.320" style="s2">in fact it&#39;s quite the opposite um and</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.280" end="01:16:04.239" style="s2">uh she&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.320" end="01:16:06.320" style="s2">working in the realm of image in a</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.239" end="01:16:07.840" style="s2">post-tragic way and really getting</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.320" end="01:16:09.199" style="s2">symbolic mortality out of her</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.840" end="01:16:09.840" style="s2">relationship with nature and things of</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.199" end="01:16:12.880" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.840" end="01:16:16.560" style="s2">quality um you know i</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.880" end="01:16:18.320" style="s2">uh so yeah so and then when it comes to</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.560" end="01:16:21.679" style="s2">philosophers in particular</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.320" end="01:16:25.520" style="s2">uh you know you have to look at</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.679" end="01:16:28.480" style="s2">well it&#39;s actually easier to identify</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.520" end="01:16:30.400" style="s2">pre-tragic or tragic philosophies um you</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.480" end="01:16:33.920" style="s2">know analytical philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.400" end="01:16:36.560" style="s2">which denies the reality of the ethical</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.920" end="01:16:38.239" style="s2">would be something like pre-tragic</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.560" end="01:16:39.600" style="s2">right because like if you&#39;re not even</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.239" end="01:16:41.360" style="s2">admitting that the ethical is a</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.600" end="01:16:43.920" style="s2">legitimate category</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.360" end="01:16:44.560" style="s2">of discourse then you can&#39;t even embrace</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.920" end="01:16:48.080" style="s2">tragedy</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.560" end="01:16:50.239" style="s2">as an actual thing in the world</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.080" end="01:16:51.920" style="s2">so those forms of analytical philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.239" end="01:16:55.840" style="s2">that deny the reality of ethics</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.920" end="01:16:57.199" style="s2">are pre-tragic some forms of post-modern</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.840" end="01:17:00.400" style="s2">theorizing are</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.199" end="01:17:03.120" style="s2">tragic and actually stuck in the tragic</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.400" end="01:17:04.000" style="s2">which is to say there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.120" end="01:17:05.840" style="s2">complicated</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.000" end="01:17:08.000" style="s2">grief that&#39;s taken place in which the</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.840" end="01:17:11.360" style="s2">identity structure itself gets connected</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.000" end="01:17:14.239" style="s2">to the identification and</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.360" end="01:17:16.320" style="s2">uh kind of witnessing of the tragic</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.239" end="01:17:19.600" style="s2">without an attempt to resolve it</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.320" end="01:17:22.640" style="s2">in fact uh a kind of fetishization</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.600" end="01:17:23.280" style="s2">of the tragic um a lot of post-modernism</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.640" end="01:17:26.800" style="s2">is like that</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.280" end="01:17:29.440" style="s2">uh actually uh and then so yeah the</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.800" end="01:17:30.560" style="s2">post-tragic forms of philosophy tend to</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.440" end="01:17:32.159" style="s2">be those ones that</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.560" end="01:17:35.679" style="s2">grapple with the ethical and the</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.159" end="01:17:39.199" style="s2">existential explicitly</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.679" end="01:17:42.880" style="s2">and which deal in</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.199" end="01:17:44.000" style="s2">the limits and nature of the tragic</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.880" end="01:17:47.600" style="s2">without</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.000" end="01:17:49.520" style="s2">getting stuck in it um and</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.600" end="01:17:51.199" style="s2">you can find those from all periods of</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.520" end="01:17:54.560" style="s2">history so it&#39;s not like the</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.199" end="01:17:58.320" style="s2">our meta modern period has a uh</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.560" end="01:17:59.840" style="s2">you know kind of like special access to</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.320" end="01:18:02.000" style="s2">the post tragic not at all</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.840" end="01:18:03.679" style="s2">there&#39;s you know again the stations are</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.000" end="01:18:05.760" style="s2">not stages so we&#39;ve been cycling through</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.679" end="01:18:07.360" style="s2">the pre-tragic tragic post-tragic</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.760" end="01:18:09.199" style="s2">for a very long time so you can find</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.360" end="01:18:12.239" style="s2">post-tragic work from</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.199" end="01:18:16.000" style="s2">from all historical epochs uh</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.239" end="01:18:16.000" style="s2">so hopefully that&#39;s that&#39;s helpful</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.960" end="01:18:23.040" style="s2">all right fantastic um pradeep had a</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.239" end="01:18:25.679" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.040" end="01:18:26.960" style="s2">we asked a while back yeah thanks</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.679" end="01:18:29.199" style="s2">nicholas</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.960" end="01:18:30.400" style="s2">zach could you comment on the different</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.199" end="01:18:34.000" style="s2">practices that</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.400" end="01:18:36.560" style="s2">you found to be very helpful in</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.000" end="01:18:37.840" style="s2">your own process or with people you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.560" end="01:18:40.320" style="s2">worked with i know you have mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.840" end="01:18:42.800" style="s2">dream work and bodywork and</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.320" end="01:18:45.120" style="s2">expanded on bodywork earlier but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.800" end="01:18:48.719" style="s2">a there seems to be a collection</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.120" end="01:18:48.719" style="s2">and is there a way to think about these</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.280" end="01:18:55.600" style="s2">i mean well a few things one is</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.719" end="01:18:57.040" style="s2">you can you can use the metapsychology</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.600" end="01:19:00.360" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.040" end="01:19:02.560" style="s2">organize a taxonomy of</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.360" end="01:19:03.760" style="s2">psychotechnologies all right so you</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.560" end="01:19:04.800" style="s2">could say</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.760" end="01:19:06.159" style="s2">looking at the existing</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.800" end="01:19:08.080" style="s2">psychotechnologies therapeutic</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.159" end="01:19:11.120" style="s2">modalities meditation techniques</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.080" end="01:19:14.480" style="s2">pedagogical approaches etc you know</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.120" end="01:19:14.880" style="s2">which of them go where um which is to</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.480" end="01:19:18.640" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.880" end="01:19:21.360" style="s2">like uh you know vipassana meditation</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.640" end="01:19:22.960" style="s2">christian contemplative prayer zen</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.360" end="01:19:24.239" style="s2">buddhism these things probably go in the</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.960" end="01:19:27.760" style="s2">transcendent</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.239" end="01:19:31.199" style="s2">and union constructive imagination</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.760" end="01:19:32.000" style="s2">and freudian dream work and some forms</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.199" end="01:19:35.920" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.000" end="01:19:39.040" style="s2">like internal family systems therapy</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.920" end="01:19:41.520" style="s2">work would go in the installment</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.040" end="01:19:42.480" style="s2">and then many traditional forms of</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.520" end="01:19:44.480" style="s2">education</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.480" end="01:19:45.600" style="s2">cognitive behavioral therapy things of</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.480" end="01:19:46.880" style="s2">that nature go in</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.600" end="01:19:48.480" style="s2">development so that&#39;s the first thing</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.880" end="01:19:49.520" style="s2">that it gives us is an opportunity to</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.480" end="01:19:51.280" style="s2">see okay</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.520" end="01:19:52.719" style="s2">we can organize the different</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.280" end="01:19:54.000" style="s2">psychotechnologies into these three</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.719" end="01:19:55.360" style="s2">categories</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.000" end="01:19:57.199" style="s2">and then if we go back to the prior</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.360" end="01:20:00.640" style="s2">question and think about diagnostics</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.199" end="01:20:03.520" style="s2">and we can figure out which type</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.640" end="01:20:05.199" style="s2">of psychotechnology would this person</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.520" end="01:20:06.880" style="s2">probably benefit from</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.199" end="01:20:08.480" style="s2">then we can start to have this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.880" end="01:20:12.480" style="s2">like integral</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.480" end="01:20:14.639" style="s2">toolbox that we can pull from um</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.480" end="01:20:15.600" style="s2">and so the first thing that needs to be</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.639" end="01:20:19.120" style="s2">done there is actually</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.600" end="01:20:22.400" style="s2">some kind of curational enterprise</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.120" end="01:20:25.679" style="s2">where we bring together under those</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.400" end="01:20:27.280" style="s2">largest uh aspects of the taxonomy we</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.679" end="01:20:28.400" style="s2">bring together kind of like best in</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.280" end="01:20:31.360" style="s2">class</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.400" end="01:20:32.719" style="s2">of all of these different modalities and</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.360" end="01:20:35.360" style="s2">i i haven&#39;t done that</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.719" end="01:20:36.480" style="s2">you know i have only taken on those</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.360" end="01:20:39.920" style="s2">modalities</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.480" end="01:20:40.719" style="s2">that have kind of come across my path</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.920" end="01:20:43.360" style="s2">and that have been</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.719" end="01:20:46.080" style="s2">been necessary and helpful for me and</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.360" end="01:20:49.920" style="s2">haven&#39;t had an opportunity to actually</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.080" end="01:20:52.960" style="s2">through systematic research and vetting</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.920" end="01:20:54.719" style="s2">do a comprehensive curation</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.960" end="01:20:57.040" style="s2">but i would love to see that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.719" end="01:21:00.719" style="s2">work done that work was begun</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.040" end="01:21:01.239" style="s2">actually under the auspices of a</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.719" end="01:21:03.920" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.239" end="01:21:05.520" style="s2">metapsychology when ken wilbur was</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.920" end="01:21:07.920" style="s2">booting integral</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.520" end="01:21:08.960" style="s2">uh institute there was an attempt to</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.920" end="01:21:11.679" style="s2">basically</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.960" end="01:21:13.280" style="s2">build a comprehensive taxonomy of</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.679" end="01:21:14.719" style="s2">psychotechnologies based on integral</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.280" end="01:21:15.840" style="s2">theory</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.719" end="01:21:17.760" style="s2">so that&#39;s the first thing i&#39;ll say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.840" end="01:21:20.880" style="s2">like there&#39;s a lot of those</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.760" end="01:21:23.280" style="s2">and the few ones that i could endorse</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.880" end="01:21:25.600" style="s2">like could actually bias you all against</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.280" end="01:21:28.239" style="s2">exploring the full range of space</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.600" end="01:21:29.600" style="s2">um and i don&#39;t want to do that but i</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.239" end="01:21:30.800" style="s2">will say a few things i mentioned last</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.600" end="01:21:34.080" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.800" end="01:21:37.440" style="s2">a specific uh form of crying practice</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.080" end="01:21:39.280" style="s2">that i used and a specific form of</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.440" end="01:21:41.679" style="s2">body work and moving practice that i</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.280" end="01:21:43.280" style="s2">used and then</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.679" end="01:21:45.760" style="s2">meditation and contemplative prayer</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.280" end="01:21:48.800" style="s2">techniques which i use</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.760" end="01:21:51.679" style="s2">and that in conjunction with</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.800" end="01:21:52.239" style="s2">probably way too much time looking at</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.679" end="01:21:56.960" style="s2">books</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.239" end="01:21:58.800" style="s2">and text and engaging in</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.960" end="01:22:00.320" style="s2">way too abstract and complex like</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.800" end="01:22:04.560" style="s2">discourse with people</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.320" end="01:22:06.880" style="s2">so those those combined um</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.560" end="01:22:06.880" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.920" end="01:22:11.360" style="s2">so you&#39;re looking for like are you</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.000" end="01:22:12.400" style="s2">actually personally curious about what</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.360" end="01:22:15.920" style="s2">i&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.400" end="01:22:17.679" style="s2">or was that enough of an answer i mean</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.920" end="01:22:19.120" style="s2">uh yeah i mean that&#39;s enough of finance</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.679" end="01:22:20.639" style="s2">if you want to share anything more</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.120" end="01:22:23.120" style="s2">it&#39;s fine mike my question was only</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.639" end="01:22:24.480" style="s2">because transcendence and development is</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.120" end="01:22:26.320" style="s2">quite clear there are a lot of things</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.480" end="01:22:26.960" style="s2">but and soulman seems to be this piece</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.320" end="01:22:28.320" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.960" end="01:22:30.000" style="s2">it&#39;s not really clear what is the</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.320" end="01:22:32.080" style="s2">spectrum of practices</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.000" end="01:22:33.840" style="s2">that are available yeah so there are</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.080" end="01:22:35.440" style="s2">many many practices available in</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.840" end="01:22:35.760" style="s2">installment at least as many as there</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.440" end="01:22:39.440" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.760" end="01:22:40.800" style="s2">in development and uh transcendence so</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.440" end="01:22:41.360" style="s2">the ones that i&#39;ve engaged with are of</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.800" end="01:22:44.560" style="s2">course</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.360" end="01:22:46.560" style="s2">dreamwork dreamwork being a classic one</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.560" end="01:22:48.719" style="s2">uh and there are particular forms of</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.560" end="01:22:51.760" style="s2">dreamwork and</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.719" end="01:22:54.159" style="s2">the ones that i&#39;ve seen hillman use</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.760" end="01:22:55.199" style="s2">specifically in his book dream in the</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.159" end="01:22:58.800" style="s2">underworld and then</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.199" end="01:22:59.840" style="s2">in from image excuse me from type to</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.800" end="01:23:01.280" style="s2">image</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.840" end="01:23:04.000" style="s2">that stuff&#39;s the best that i&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.280" end="01:23:06.239" style="s2">where you work with the dream</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.000" end="01:23:08.000" style="s2">not to extract the symbol into the</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.239" end="01:23:08.480" style="s2">transcendent but you work with the dream</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.000" end="01:23:10.239" style="s2">as an</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.480" end="01:23:12.159" style="s2">image and work the uniqueness of the</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.239" end="01:23:12.639" style="s2">image to clarify the uniqueness of your</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.159" end="01:23:15.600" style="s2">own</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.639" end="01:23:17.600" style="s2">self so dreamwork is classic</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.600" end="01:23:18.639" style="s2">constructive imagination in the jungian</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.600" end="01:23:20.960" style="s2">sense is also</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.639" end="01:23:23.280" style="s2">good this needs to be coupled with a</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.960" end="01:23:25.760" style="s2">strong transcendent meditation practice</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.280" end="01:23:27.600" style="s2">because it works like completely</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.760" end="01:23:29.520" style="s2">stilling the mind</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.600" end="01:23:30.639" style="s2">and then kicking off through some kind</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.520" end="01:23:32.239" style="s2">of generator function</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.639" end="01:23:34.639" style="s2">thought literally something like a</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.239" end="01:23:36.639" style="s2">waking dream so the constructive</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.639" end="01:23:39.199" style="s2">imagination exercises</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.639" end="01:23:40.719" style="s2">are done consciously and intentionally</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.199" end="01:23:43.920" style="s2">to induce</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.719" end="01:23:44.560" style="s2">a free-form imagination so that you can</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.920" end="01:23:46.400" style="s2">witness</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.560" end="01:23:48.960" style="s2">spontaneously the constructions of your</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.400" end="01:23:51.120" style="s2">own unconscious and</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.960" end="01:23:52.560" style="s2">if you&#39;re a serious meditator sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.120" end="01:23:55.120" style="s2">these things will happen</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.560" end="01:23:55.600" style="s2">automatically by accident and you&#39;ll get</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.120" end="01:23:58.000" style="s2">this like</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.600" end="01:23:58.800" style="s2">vision of bodhisattvas or that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.000" end="01:24:00.480" style="s2">stuff so</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.800" end="01:24:02.719" style="s2">but it is possible to cultivate and jung</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.480" end="01:24:04.400" style="s2">did this completely outside of like</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.719" end="01:24:06.480" style="s2">explosive meditation context he would</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.400" end="01:24:08.880" style="s2">sit and he would play with blocks</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.480" end="01:24:11.280" style="s2">literally like stones and little rocks</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.880" end="01:24:12.880" style="s2">and build little towers and things</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.280" end="01:24:14.719" style="s2">and that would free his cognitive mind</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.880" end="01:24:17.360" style="s2">and he would get these then images that</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.719" end="01:24:18.880" style="s2">would just flood into his awareness</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.360" end="01:24:20.320" style="s2">including images that were prophetic</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.880" end="01:24:21.360" style="s2">about the coming of world war ii and a</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.320" end="01:24:23.920" style="s2">few other things</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.360" end="01:24:24.639" style="s2">so if you again some people walk or ride</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.920" end="01:24:26.800" style="s2">bikes</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.639" end="01:24:28.159" style="s2">or sex but whatever happens that it</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.800" end="01:24:31.280" style="s2">frees</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.159" end="01:24:33.760" style="s2">from cognition and opens the</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.280" end="01:24:34.719" style="s2">not like you&#39;re daydreaming and making</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.760" end="01:24:36.400" style="s2">it something happen</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.719" end="01:24:37.920" style="s2">like you&#39;re fantasizing about something</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.400" end="01:24:40.400" style="s2">and i&#39;m gonna get that and then</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.920" end="01:24:42.159" style="s2">but you it&#39;s your mind by itself</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.400" end="01:24:43.840" style="s2">endogenously creating</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.159" end="01:24:45.840" style="s2">image that&#39;s what you want to create so</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.840" end="01:24:50.239" style="s2">that&#39;s active imagination</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.840" end="01:24:50.960" style="s2">uh and then um practices that engage</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.239" end="01:24:53.600" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.960" end="01:24:54.719" style="s2">the imagery that&#39;s possible through</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.600" end="01:24:57.040" style="s2">language</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.719" end="01:24:58.400" style="s2">in in the non-cognitive function so</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.040" end="01:25:01.920" style="s2">poetry</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.400" end="01:25:05.199" style="s2">uh music</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.920" end="01:25:07.040" style="s2">and those</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.199" end="01:25:08.880" style="s2">those forms of engagement so for me</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.040" end="01:25:10.719" style="s2">music i was a musician before i was</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.880" end="01:25:13.760" style="s2">anything else</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.719" end="01:25:14.800" style="s2">music was was huge uh so</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.760" end="01:25:16.719" style="s2">so that&#39;s a little bit more in the</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.800" end="01:25:18.239" style="s2">domains of installment but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.719" end="01:25:21.280" style="s2">there&#39;s more than that like the</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.239" end="01:25:23.360" style="s2">vajrayana tradition of buddhism</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.280" end="01:25:25.199" style="s2">i would count under the realm of</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.360" end="01:25:27.280" style="s2">insolent where they actually have these</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.199" end="01:25:30.480" style="s2">specific practices</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.280" end="01:25:34.080" style="s2">of constructive imagination where you</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.480" end="01:25:35.280" style="s2">in your imagination get the image of the</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.080" end="01:25:37.840" style="s2">deity</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.280" end="01:25:39.679" style="s2">and then meditate on the properties of</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.840" end="01:25:41.280" style="s2">the deity and then flip it so that you</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.679" end="01:25:43.760" style="s2">are wearing the mask of the deity and</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.280" end="01:25:45.760" style="s2">you become the deity and are empowered</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.760" end="01:25:47.679" style="s2">through the mandala of imagination that</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.760" end="01:25:49.600" style="s2">you&#39;ve created over prior meditations</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.679" end="01:25:51.520" style="s2">so vajrayana buddhism is another example</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.600" end="01:25:54.719" style="s2">christian contemplative prayer similarly</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.520" end="01:25:56.800" style="s2">if you work with free-flowing images of</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.719" end="01:26:00.800" style="s2">christ and things of that nature</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.800" end="01:26:03.199" style="s2">so beautiful thank you</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.800" end="01:26:06.000" style="s2">so one more question that i gotta wrap</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.199" end="01:26:08.560" style="s2">but this has been blast guys thank you</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.000" end="01:26:09.120" style="s2">all right we have one more question uh</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.560" end="01:26:13.040" style="s2">david</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.120" end="01:26:16.080" style="s2">swedlow go ahead</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.040" end="01:26:17.520" style="s2">yeah thanks um zach i&#39;m i&#39;m curious i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.080" end="01:26:18.719" style="s2">i&#39;m really loving the way that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.520" end="01:26:20.400" style="s2">exploring this as you&#39;re bringing the</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.719" end="01:26:21.120" style="s2">model of the meta psychology out to us</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.400" end="01:26:22.880" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.120" end="01:26:24.480" style="s2">any really engaging the questions as you</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.880" end="01:26:26.000" style="s2">said the reflections are helping you</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.480" end="01:26:27.840" style="s2">look at it differently</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.000" end="01:26:29.280" style="s2">um and i&#39;m curious as well about the</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.840" end="01:26:32.400" style="s2">sense of um</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.280" end="01:26:34.320" style="s2">whether you see the model in some way as</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.400" end="01:26:35.440" style="s2">a coping mechanism your deeper model of</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.320" end="01:26:37.840" style="s2">the way of understanding</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.440" end="01:26:39.600" style="s2">and something like that the work of the</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.840" end="01:26:40.719" style="s2">wounded healer is to bring the model out</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.600" end="01:26:42.719" style="s2">to people</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.719" end="01:26:44.400" style="s2">so that it can be challenged more deeply</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.719" end="01:26:46.719" style="s2">so that it gets</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.400" end="01:26:48.080" style="s2">it gets tested in the fires of actual</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.719" end="01:26:50.400" style="s2">experience of other people</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.080" end="01:26:52.000" style="s2">and so i&#39;m curious as you&#39;re engaging in</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.400" end="01:26:52.560" style="s2">this process and then doing it do you</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.000" end="01:26:55.600" style="s2">get</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.560" end="01:26:57.280" style="s2">insights in yourself about</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.600" end="01:26:59.199" style="s2">you know kind of a deeper sense not just</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.280" end="01:27:02.480" style="s2">the insides of the model but inside</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.199" end="01:27:04.639" style="s2">onto how you came to the model or how</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.480" end="01:27:05.760" style="s2">how this is growing you does that make</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.639" end="01:27:09.600" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.760" end="01:27:12.719" style="s2">totally i mean this is uh this is why</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.600" end="01:27:14.000" style="s2">uh i love teaching</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.719" end="01:27:16.400" style="s2">because like you don&#39;t really know</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.000" end="01:27:19.440" style="s2">anything until you&#39;ve tried to</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.400" end="01:27:21.600" style="s2">convey it to someone and uh and then</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.440" end="01:27:22.880" style="s2">being in that exchange like this q a</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.600" end="01:27:23.920" style="s2">here made me wish i did the whole thing</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.880" end="01:27:25.280" style="s2">q and a but i couldn&#39;t because i</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.920" end="01:27:27.199" style="s2">actually had to lay out the framework to</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.280" end="01:27:29.040" style="s2">make this q a useful but</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.199" end="01:27:30.159" style="s2">so yeah there was it was it was very</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.040" end="01:27:30.880" style="s2">exciting this session for me in</p>

<p begin="01:27:30.880" end="01:27:35.120" style="s2">um because it made me realize hey people</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.840" end="01:27:36.400" style="s2">are actually understanding this</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.120" end="01:27:37.679" style="s2">because it seems like wow would anyone</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.400" end="01:27:39.920" style="s2">even be interested or understand but you</p>

<p begin="01:27:39.920" end="01:27:43.760" style="s2">expressions in my own terminology which</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.239" end="01:27:45.440" style="s2">are more sophisticated than some of the</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.760" end="01:27:46.800" style="s2">ones that i uttered so i&#39;m like yes</p>
