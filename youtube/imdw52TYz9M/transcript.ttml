<p begin="00:00:54.149" end="00:01:06.420" style="s2">of the very like fundamental part of it</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.969" end="00:01:10.890" style="s2">it&#39;s first to not harm and then to try</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.420" end="00:01:16.830" style="s2">and engage with the world as wisely as I</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.890" end="00:01:19.259" style="s2">can and try and make the world a little</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.830" end="00:01:23.729" style="s2">bit better place than when I came into</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.259" end="00:01:28.070" style="s2">it and so you know that might be but</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.729" end="00:01:31.079" style="s2">like such a huge part of that is</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.070" end="00:01:32.820" style="s2">understanding the world and so like</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.079" end="00:01:35.970" style="s2">there&#39;s all these different components</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.820" end="00:01:39.540" style="s2">that go into that of like figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.970" end="00:01:41.579" style="s2">ok what is real what is true so how that</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.540" end="00:01:44.250" style="s2">I can know how to take the most</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.579" end="00:01:46.439" style="s2">effective action in the world and you</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.250" end="00:01:47.850" style="s2">know to be in relationship with other</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.439" end="00:01:49.259" style="s2">people because other people are gonna</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.850" end="00:01:51.689" style="s2">help me understand the world better</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.259" end="00:01:54.869" style="s2">because I don&#39;t have the full picture in</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.689" end="00:01:57.210" style="s2">my mind and so I have ideas but I need</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.869" end="00:01:59.430" style="s2">other people to do that and so like</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.210" end="00:02:01.799" style="s2">figuring out how to be in relationship</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.430" end="00:02:07.619" style="s2">with other people in order to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.799" end="00:02:11.220" style="s2">how to make the world yeah a little bit</p>

<p begin="00:02:22.480" end="00:02:30.100" style="s2">interaction that I have is like can i mi</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.790" end="00:02:33.400" style="s2">better and another person a little bit</p>

<p begin="00:02:33.400" end="00:02:40.720" style="s2">interaction yeah it&#39;s very impromptu but</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.880" end="00:02:42.310" style="s2">but that&#39;s kind of what I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.720" end="00:02:46.180" style="s2">thinking about in the last 24 hours is</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.310" end="00:02:51.840" style="s2">like you know like first not harm and</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.180" end="00:02:54.730" style="s2">that&#39;s easier said than done and then to</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.840" end="00:02:57.610" style="s2">understand the world as best I can</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.730" end="00:03:04.440" style="s2">so that I can help make it a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.610" end="00:03:07.090" style="s2">better that&#39;s my purpose say during the</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.440" end="00:03:08.680" style="s2">beginning part but these questions are</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.090" end="00:03:10.120" style="s2">never fully answered it&#39;s about you</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.680" end="00:03:12.340" style="s2">constantly asking them and they&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.120" end="00:03:17.290" style="s2">hard questions because your purpose is</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.340" end="00:03:18.910" style="s2">not like no not a it&#39;s not a simple one</p>

<p begin="00:03:45.160" end="00:03:51.580" style="s2">think I when and when I as an individual</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.480" end="00:03:54.880" style="s2">I&#39;m asking myself the question what is</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.580" end="00:03:58.420" style="s2">my purpose then I think it&#39;s more about</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.880" end="00:04:00.160" style="s2">you know what do I particularly bring to</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.420" end="00:04:01.300" style="s2">the table in terms of you know leaving</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.160" end="00:04:02.830" style="s2">the world a little bit better than it</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.300" end="00:04:06.060" style="s2">was when I found it you know what what</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.830" end="00:04:08.100" style="s2">what what particularly about me is</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.060" end="00:04:11.410" style="s2">suitable to did you know what I mean so</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.100" end="00:04:14.500" style="s2">it&#39;s about identifying that and I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.410" end="00:04:16.720" style="s2">guess I&#39;ve always always known that my</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.500" end="00:04:19.390" style="s2">Dharma if you like you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.720" end="00:04:21.729" style="s2">though that do you know what the word</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.390" end="00:04:24.669" style="s2">means do I need to explain it okay</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.729" end="00:04:26.470" style="s2">um is is to do with teaching I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.669" end="00:04:27.880" style="s2">was a teacher for the last 15 years of</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.470" end="00:04:30.580" style="s2">my career before that I was in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.880" end="00:04:33.550" style="s2">restaurant business and you know the</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.580" end="00:04:36.430" style="s2">reason I rose through ranks and</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.550" end="00:04:39.150" style="s2">management was because of my ability to</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.430" end="00:04:42.820" style="s2">train staff so I&#39;ve always kind of had a</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.150" end="00:04:44.590" style="s2">both like an impulse and a neck for it</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.820" end="00:04:46.380" style="s2">right so I&#39;ve always known my purpose is</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.590" end="00:04:48.430" style="s2">something to do with that now the</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.380" end="00:04:52.360" style="s2">greater clarity than that I&#39;ve not</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.430" end="00:04:54.190" style="s2">really cheese but as Kira mentioned it</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.360" end="00:04:55.840" style="s2">exists on a multitude of levels</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.190" end="00:04:57.700" style="s2">simultaneously right I mean if you ask</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.840" end="00:04:59.320" style="s2">my cats what&#39;s my purpose my purpose is</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.700" end="00:05:00.550" style="s2">to give them food and clean their litter</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.320" end="00:05:03.520" style="s2">box for them you know what I mean and</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.550" end="00:05:06.190" style="s2">and yeah that is indeed part of my</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.520" end="00:05:08.289" style="s2">purpose right and you know and so you</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.190" end="00:05:09.850" style="s2">know I live out in the country I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.289" end="00:05:12.580" style="s2">chickens I&#39;ve got land you know part of</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.850" end="00:05:14.200" style="s2">my purposes too is to maintain all of</p>

<p begin="00:05:14.200" end="00:05:18.310" style="s2">that kind of thing and so you know it</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.210" end="00:05:20.169" style="s2">does exist on multiple levels</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.310" end="00:05:22.060" style="s2">simultaneously right down to you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.169" end="00:05:25.060" style="s2">what is my purpose this morning you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.060" end="00:05:27.760" style="s2">what I mean and then yeah so yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.060" end="00:05:29.950" style="s2">it is a big and difficult question it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.760" end="00:05:31.690" style="s2">an iterative one right it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.950" end="00:05:33.700" style="s2">it&#39;s one that exists on a multitude of</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.690" end="00:05:35.530" style="s2">scales and is always changing and</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.700" end="00:05:38.080" style="s2">progressing as you move through your</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.530" end="00:05:40.830" style="s2">life so yeah you can&#39;t really ask many</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.080" end="00:05:40.830" style="s2">bigger questions</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.640" end="00:05:54.730" style="s2">Nephi&#39;s cool thank you thank you whoever</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.780" end="00:05:56.170" style="s2">just tell me I was metre SI then of</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.730" end="00:05:58.840" style="s2">course you have a new face who said I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.170" end="00:06:00.010" style="s2">tried to attempt your name baby so the</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.840" end="00:06:01.540" style="s2">universe didn&#39;t want me to be unmuted</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.010" end="00:06:03.630" style="s2">for that so clearly I probably got it</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.540" end="00:06:03.630" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.870" end="00:06:08.650" style="s2">Eric shared Kyra shared so an idea cafe</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.880" end="00:06:11.650" style="s2">we all take a turn sharing or you can</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.650" end="00:06:13.120" style="s2">pass on answer either question so Shila</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.650" end="00:06:15.280" style="s2">would you like to share it I can share</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.120" end="00:06:20.260" style="s2">we won&#39;t throw Hank into the I&#39;m seating</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.280" end="00:06:22.900" style="s2">point yet since I just joined us I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.260" end="00:06:27.130" style="s2">have to say I agree with both Eric and</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.900" end="00:06:28.870" style="s2">Kyra that it does change and it is</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.130" end="00:06:32.260" style="s2">definitely about making a positive</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.870" end="00:06:36.520" style="s2">impact in the world but I have to say my</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.260" end="00:06:40.120" style="s2">like deepest purpose is really balanced</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.520" end="00:06:43.720" style="s2">like finding balance in my life and also</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.120" end="00:06:47.290" style="s2">in the world and so part of that for me</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.720" end="00:06:50.440" style="s2">is sharing this internal vision I have</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.290" end="00:06:54.760" style="s2">of a possible world that we could create</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.440" end="00:06:57.430" style="s2">together and kind of helping other</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.760" end="00:06:59.919" style="s2">people see that possibility so that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.430" end="00:07:03.250" style="s2">so as a creative and an artist that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.919" end="00:07:05.080" style="s2">kind of money half to do that but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.250" end="00:07:07.540" style="s2">really mostly about balance and balance</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.080" end="00:07:10.330" style="s2">is really key for me and not</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.540" end="00:07:13.479" style="s2">overextending not being overwhelmed by</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.330" end="00:07:17.380" style="s2">just game a it&#39;s really about finding</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.479" end="00:07:20.130" style="s2">balance in the world and having a</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.380" end="00:07:20.130" style="s2">positive impact</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.070" end="00:07:30.570" style="s2">right I&#39;ll go next since no one can go</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.700" end="00:07:34.380" style="s2">um my purpose like Shiloh I have a very</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.570" end="00:07:35.910" style="s2">big big purpose that I I feel like I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.380" end="00:07:37.200" style="s2">known since I was a kid I just didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.910" end="00:07:39.480" style="s2">know what that purpose was like when I</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.200" end="00:07:41.610" style="s2">was a kid it was about you know the</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.480" end="00:07:42.870" style="s2">world finding out about Jesus the second</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.610" end="00:07:46.050" style="s2">coming of Christ couldn&#39;t happen until</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.870" end="00:07:48.480" style="s2">everyone had heard and then it took</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.050" end="00:07:50.400" style="s2">losing it to find it like losing their</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.480" end="00:07:53.010" style="s2">there is no progress there&#39;s no making</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.400" end="00:07:56.010" style="s2">sense the universe there&#39;s no in order</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.010" end="00:07:57.390" style="s2">to come to my grand purpose which is</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.010" end="00:07:59.400" style="s2">creating a world that works for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.390" end="00:08:01.020" style="s2">and creating the parallel cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.400" end="00:08:03.870" style="s2">system that out competes the tentative</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.020" end="00:08:05.820" style="s2">one and even that&#39;s not my purpose like</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.870" end="00:08:07.440" style="s2">my purpose although I needed that to</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.820" end="00:08:11.669" style="s2">truly step in to my purpose my purpose</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.440" end="00:08:13.950" style="s2">is to find my Road to joy and my road to</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.669" end="00:08:15.510" style="s2">happiness and my road to balance and in</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.950" end="00:08:18.060" style="s2">answering these five questions for</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.510" end="00:08:20.790" style="s2">myself hoping that other people answer</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.060" end="00:08:22.290" style="s2">their five questions and then yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.790" end="00:08:24.330" style="s2">have that vision of a world that works</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.290" end="00:08:26.040" style="s2">for everyone but it&#39;s like the little</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.330" end="00:08:27.720" style="s2">actions to step towards it because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.040" end="00:08:29.310" style="s2">very much here to figure out balance to</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.720" end="00:08:31.020" style="s2">figure out surrender and acceptance</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.310" end="00:08:32.460" style="s2">because those are the lessons of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.020" end="00:08:37.169" style="s2">universe keeps there and I think our</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.460" end="00:08:39.360" style="s2">purpose is a combination of what comes</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.169" end="00:08:40.500" style="s2">easy to us that comes hard to everyone</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.360" end="00:08:43.560" style="s2">else so we don&#39;t even give ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.500" end="00:08:45.420" style="s2">credit that we&#39;re good at it and what is</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.560" end="00:08:48.210" style="s2">so hard for us that&#39;s easy for other</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.420" end="00:08:49.950" style="s2">people like it&#39;s the combination of what</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.210" end="00:08:52.890" style="s2">we struggle with and what we are good at</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.950" end="00:08:55.710" style="s2">and it&#39;s just like this is the verb</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.890" end="00:08:57.750" style="s2">peace this is everything that you do in</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.710" end="00:08:59.820" style="s2">your life so it is about feeding the cat</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.750" end="00:09:01.770" style="s2">it is about like being my kids parent</p>

<p begin="00:09:01.770" end="00:09:08.339" style="s2">kid became her parent is very much part</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.280" end="00:09:10.290" style="s2">of my purpose and learning what I&#39;m here</p>

<p begin="00:09:28.410" end="00:09:33.150" style="s2">find their map and there even though</p>

<p begin="00:09:44.589" end="00:09:49.240" style="s2">the world but like that&#39;s an almost</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.420" end="00:09:51.100" style="s2">bigger piece to give so that is a bit of</p>

<p begin="00:10:38.319" end="00:10:44.220" style="s2">how people think and that&#39;s by</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.220" end="00:10:47.769" style="s2">incorporating a certain sense of</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.220" end="00:10:49.329" style="s2">mindfulness growth mindsets applying the</p>

<p begin="00:10:49.329" end="00:10:57.279" style="s2">self-compassion so there&#39;s a few of</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.600" end="00:10:59.829" style="s2">those elements and like I was an IT</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.279" end="00:11:03.189" style="s2">before this I did about 10 years of IT</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.829" end="00:11:06.730" style="s2">and I just found that between teams</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.189" end="00:11:07.959" style="s2">people don&#39;t really connect as well so I</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.730" end="00:11:09.910" style="s2">was a business analyst kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.959" end="00:11:12.579" style="s2">connecting up the teams and getting</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.910" end="00:11:15.490" style="s2">people to to kind of speak the same</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.579" end="00:11:20.079" style="s2">language as to say and there&#39;s a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:13:58.540" end="00:14:03.730" style="s2">of my childhood I am a product of all of</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.120" end="00:14:07.210" style="s2">these things I don&#39;t make decisions</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.730" end="00:14:13.870" style="s2">independent of all of that so learning</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.210" end="00:14:17.560" style="s2">how to live in harmony with the universe</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.870" end="00:14:23.230" style="s2">like my purpose is figuring out how to</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.560" end="00:14:26.260" style="s2">be how to how to how to express</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.230" end="00:14:28.720" style="s2">everything that is me within like flow</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.260" end="00:14:30.760" style="s2">of the universe because you know sure I</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.720" end="00:14:31.960" style="s2">can look around and say oh the world&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.760" end="00:14:35.740" style="s2">supposed to work this way</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.960" end="00:14:37.420" style="s2">yeah and then proceed to slam my head</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.740" end="00:14:40.630" style="s2">into a wall trying to make it look like</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.420" end="00:14:45.010" style="s2">that but if I go with the flow of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.630" end="00:14:46.900" style="s2">universe then like that&#39;s where I find</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.010" end="00:14:49.380" style="s2">that you know the balance that was</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.900" end="00:14:51.940" style="s2">discussed by Jubilee and Shiloh is like</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.380" end="00:14:54.220" style="s2">being in the flow of it and not just</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.940" end="00:14:56.500" style="s2">simply like creating a story and saying</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.220" end="00:14:58.630" style="s2">this is food this is this is who I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.500" end="00:15:00.840" style="s2">supposed to be and this is how I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.630" end="00:15:03.430" style="s2">do it and this is what I need to fix</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.840" end="00:15:05.590" style="s2">it&#39;s looking I mean there is looking</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.430" end="00:15:09.550" style="s2">around and figuring out where do I fit</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.590" end="00:15:13.720" style="s2">where where do I fit in the flow yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.550" end="00:15:16.120" style="s2">for me it&#39;s comes I think I chose to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.720" end="00:15:18.070" style="s2">exactly me before a lot here that I</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.120" end="00:15:19.750" style="s2">planned it all out whatever the means</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.070" end="00:15:22.180" style="s2">whatever the bigger me is that&#39;s in all</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.750" end="00:15:23.770" style="s2">of us it&#39;s like this is I was exactly in</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.180" end="00:15:26.710" style="s2">the family I have to quit I&#39;m supposed</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.770" end="00:15:29.200" style="s2">to have every interaction and not in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.710" end="00:15:30.520" style="s2">life if this because if you don&#39;t learn</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.200" end="00:15:32.200" style="s2">your lesson the universe just keeps</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.520" end="00:15:34.090" style="s2">giving it to you like you just keep</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.200" end="00:15:35.800" style="s2">repeating my grade again and again again</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.090" end="00:15:37.150" style="s2">and so you get it and so it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.800" end="00:15:38.320" style="s2">everything is orchestrated you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.150" end="00:15:39.430" style="s2">have a choice is it like there are</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.320" end="00:15:41.710" style="s2">things you&#39;re here to learn that you</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.430" end="00:15:43.000" style="s2">signed up to learn and now you have to</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.710" end="00:15:46.900" style="s2">finish the course like there&#39;s no other</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.000" end="00:15:51.460" style="s2">option and so there&#39;s often this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.900" end="00:15:53.500" style="s2">a like a perfect perfect being we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.460" end="00:15:55.690" style="s2">trying to be and I don&#39;t hold to that</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.500" end="00:15:57.790" style="s2">because I think that if there&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.690" end="00:15:59.350" style="s2">path whenever your path is towards your</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.790" end="00:16:01.780" style="s2">purpose and what you&#39;re here to do and</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.350" end="00:16:03.910" style="s2">what society says verse 3 supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.780" end="00:16:04.510" style="s2">look like and this is supposed to be the</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.910" end="00:16:06.700" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.510" end="00:16:08.260" style="s2">that those are two diabolically opposite</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.700" end="00:16:10.900" style="s2">it&#39;s like I&#39;m trying to be fun something</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.260" end="00:16:14.440" style="s2">or I am something and I&#39;m uncovering and</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.900" end="00:16:15.880" style="s2">discovering it and but but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.440" end="00:16:17.740" style="s2">balance in that sirs</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.880" end="00:16:19.570" style="s2">I&#39;m definitely way too safar on the</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.740" end="00:16:22.870" style="s2">other side of leg this is me it takes me</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.570" end="00:16:24.490" style="s2">relieve me TMI but that&#39;s that&#39;s my role</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.870" end="00:16:25.810" style="s2">and that&#39;s okay and there&#39;s people who</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.490" end="00:16:27.490" style="s2">are also on the other side it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.810" end="00:16:29.620" style="s2">lot of the conflict to me my sister is</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.490" end="00:16:32.530" style="s2">that she&#39;s the opposite where it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.620" end="00:16:34.750" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna be this CEO female leader and</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.530" end="00:16:36.880" style="s2">look like this and they&#39;re diabolically</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.750" end="00:16:37.990" style="s2">opposed in a way that the you know what</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.880" end="00:16:39.400" style="s2">I mean because she&#39;s like well why can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.990" end="00:16:41.050" style="s2">you just change to be better and like</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.400" end="00:16:45.100" style="s2">why can&#39;t you just be yourself and I</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.050" end="00:16:46.900" style="s2">care about the world things and I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.100" end="00:16:49.300" style="s2">there&#39;s balance there but I&#39;m on the far</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.900" end="00:16:50.980" style="s2">ends of the I chose this and everyone is</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.300" end="00:16:52.870" style="s2">living exactly the life they&#39;re supposed</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.980" end="00:16:55.330" style="s2">to live but that allows for people</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.870" end="00:17:02.950" style="s2">living the opposite life and it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.330" end="00:17:05.860" style="s2">allowing for that within my own person I</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.950" end="00:17:10.209" style="s2">think for me it&#39;s kind of both and I</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.860" end="00:17:12.820" style="s2">feel like I came here with a mission of</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.209" end="00:17:16.720" style="s2">sorts like I chose ahead of time before</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.820" end="00:17:19.660" style="s2">I embodied in this life time and at the</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.720" end="00:17:22.290" style="s2">same time I feel like it&#39;s constantly my</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.660" end="00:17:25.839" style="s2">purpose is constantly being uncovered or</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.290" end="00:17:31.060" style="s2">evolving as I go so I&#39;m affected by my</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.839" end="00:17:34.030" style="s2">present reality as well as my past my</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.060" end="00:17:39.120" style="s2">ancestral past that kind of thing so I</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.030" end="00:17:39.120" style="s2">do feel like it&#39;s a both/and for me and</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.270" end="00:17:46.150" style="s2">trying to live in the moment and hear or</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.030" end="00:17:49.330" style="s2">sense the direction it&#39;s kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.150" end="00:17:51.280" style="s2">goal for that balance in my life but the</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.330" end="00:17:52.990" style="s2">outside world is always kind of taking</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.280" end="00:17:55.150" style="s2">me off track and I get overwhelmed then</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.990" end="00:17:57.280" style="s2">I have to come back to Center so for me</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.150" end="00:17:58.750" style="s2">I think I here for a purpose I think it</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.280" end="00:18:00.400" style="s2">was maybe always with me I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.750" end="00:18:04.090" style="s2">discover it until after I had a major</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.400" end="00:18:06.460" style="s2">you know trauma in my life and then it</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.090" end="00:18:08.560" style="s2">kind of burst open and I discover more</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.460" end="00:18:11.170" style="s2">and more of myself which is beautiful I</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.560" end="00:18:13.600" style="s2">get rid of that trauma I find more</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.170" end="00:18:16.680" style="s2">people like me I don&#39;t know how we</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.600" end="00:18:16.680" style="s2">didn&#39;t answer your question</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.070" end="00:18:30.590" style="s2">weirdly mute in silence building natural</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.940" end="00:18:33.830" style="s2">silence that comes in it&#39;s like um Rob</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.590" end="00:18:40.220" style="s2">you did it seems a little weird the</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.830" end="00:18:42.289" style="s2">silence what about you Mary I think of</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.220" end="00:18:45.679" style="s2">the answers that I&#39;ve heard I think when</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.289" end="00:18:47.990" style="s2">I&#39;m probably closest in alignment with</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.679" end="00:18:51.049" style="s2">his Shiloh&#39;s the both and kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.990" end="00:18:53.360" style="s2">III think it&#39;s almost actually in a way</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.049" end="00:18:57.529" style="s2">a false dichotomy that I&#39;ve created</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.360" end="00:18:59.360" style="s2">there right that yeah is is it yeah in a</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.529" end="00:19:02.720" style="s2">sense of meaningless questions so yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.360" end="00:19:05.870" style="s2">I think both and is is probably where I</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.720" end="00:19:07.129" style="s2">go yeah you laugh but it is it is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.870" end="00:19:08.450" style="s2">question that is asked you know I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.129" end="00:19:11.299" style="s2">been asked a lot through time you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.450" end="00:19:15.169" style="s2">what I mean and people love themselves</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.299" end="00:19:16.610" style="s2">as well yeah I am I mean I&#39;m Jubilee and</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.169" end="00:19:19.009" style="s2">I have had this conversation a few times</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.610" end="00:19:21.250" style="s2">in a few different rooms I&#39;m personally</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.009" end="00:19:24.070" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.250" end="00:19:25.420" style="s2">a believer in you know everything is</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.070" end="00:19:27.820" style="s2">unfolding exactly as it should</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.420" end="00:19:30.580" style="s2">everything unfolds as it unfolds and</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.820" end="00:19:31.900" style="s2">then we retrospectively link things</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.580" end="00:19:33.610" style="s2">together and tell ourselves a story</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.900" end="00:19:35.380" style="s2">which is meaningful to us yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.610" end="00:19:36.610" style="s2">that&#39;s how I see it but who knows I mean</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.380" end="00:19:38.860" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m right I&#39;m just saying</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.610" end="00:19:40.930" style="s2">that&#39;s how I see it we come from</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.860" end="00:19:43.120" style="s2">different standpoints on that so yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.930" end="00:19:44.800" style="s2">guess if I had to choose one of those</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.120" end="00:19:48.550" style="s2">positions I guess I would be more in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.800" end="00:19:51.670" style="s2">existentialist camp but we absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.550" end="00:19:53.410" style="s2">have the power to narrate the story of</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.670" end="00:19:54.880" style="s2">our own lives there&#39;s not to say we can</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.410" end="00:19:57.130" style="s2">in any way control the events of our</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.880" end="00:19:59.470" style="s2">lives right but we can be the character</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.130" end="00:20:01.270" style="s2">we wish to be you know and you know all</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.470" end="00:20:02.650" style="s2">that the Shakespeare Theatre stage and</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.270" end="00:20:04.330" style="s2">all the men and women merely players we</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.650" end="00:20:06.400" style="s2">can be any player that we want to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.330" end="00:20:09.160" style="s2">right we can we can absolutely choose to</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.400" end="00:20:13.660" style="s2">adopt any thing that we want and so our</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.160" end="00:20:16.690" style="s2">values are central to the person that we</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.660" end="00:20:17.980" style="s2">mold for ourselves right I mean I I know</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.690" end="00:20:18.820" style="s2">we&#39;re born with genes and we&#39;re born</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.980" end="00:20:20.680" style="s2">with certain with you know with</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.820" end="00:20:22.780" style="s2">archetypes and certain thing but but</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.680" end="00:20:26.130" style="s2">we&#39;re to a very large extent a blank</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.780" end="00:20:29.620" style="s2">slate when we&#39;re born and so we do have</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.130" end="00:20:31.780" style="s2">like a massive possibility space open to</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.620" end="00:20:34.620" style="s2">us at the table which gradually narrows</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.780" end="00:20:37.270" style="s2">and narrows and narrows as we adopt</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.620" end="00:20:38.890" style="s2">personas and characteristics and and</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.270" end="00:20:41.440" style="s2">start to limit ourselves by telling</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.890" end="00:20:43.150" style="s2">ourselves we are a certain way right and</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.440" end="00:20:44.950" style="s2">and so that starts to narrow our</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.150" end="00:20:47.680" style="s2">possibility space but yeah I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.950" end="00:20:49.789" style="s2">I do think we choose to a very large</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.680" end="00:20:52.140" style="s2">degree</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.789" end="00:20:55.070" style="s2">not necessarily consciously but how we</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.140" end="00:20:55.070" style="s2">narrow that space</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.790" end="00:21:05.160" style="s2">sorry we doing something in the kitchen</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.020" end="00:21:06.240" style="s2">sets a little bit noisy I&#39;ll jump on one</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.160" end="00:21:13.110" style="s2">it&#39;s a little bit more quiet</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.240" end="00:21:14.730" style="s2">that&#39;s quite now that there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.110" end="00:21:19.320" style="s2">that not brought up in me Eric of like</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.730" end="00:21:21.930" style="s2">it was one cup of it so just maybe from</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.320" end="00:21:23.640" style="s2">my side what I&#39;ve learned I mean just</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.930" end="00:21:27.090" style="s2">from from the learning part of life is</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.640" end="00:21:30.240" style="s2">that you are you go through certain</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.090" end="00:21:33.120" style="s2">sense of trauma and it could be it could</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.240" end="00:21:35.520" style="s2">be bigger to be small it could be it</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.120" end="00:21:37.680" style="s2">could be a elder who maybe develops a</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.520" end="00:21:39.720" style="s2">sense of dementia and then you find your</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.680" end="00:21:43.980" style="s2">path in life when you try to cure</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.720" end="00:21:46.470" style="s2">dementia or move into so we very much</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.980" end="00:21:48.090" style="s2">structure our life around that and I and</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.470" end="00:21:50.880" style="s2">I do you think that is a quite quite a</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.090" end="00:21:53.840" style="s2">powerful force as well and then I do</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.880" end="00:21:56.820" style="s2">resonate quite well with the essence of</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.840" end="00:21:59.820" style="s2">I&#39;ve chosen to be here and to bring</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.820" end="00:22:02.910" style="s2">something in this life and and and make</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.820" end="00:22:05.340" style="s2">change I I think with me I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.910" end="00:22:07.680" style="s2">realize that they is a learning</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.340" end="00:22:08.850" style="s2">component to it as well and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.680" end="00:22:14.040" style="s2">something that I&#39;ve discovered much</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.850" end="00:22:20.490" style="s2">later you know if there&#39;s anything else</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.040" end="00:22:22.200" style="s2">I could explain it to you if yeah thank</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.490" end="00:22:24.210" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.200" end="00:22:25.410" style="s2">that&#39;s saying about what Eric&#39;s was</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.210" end="00:22:27.240" style="s2">saying it would have brought up with</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.410" end="00:22:29.340" style="s2">like if it is a choice right if it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.240" end="00:22:30.960" style="s2">necessarily and it probably isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.340" end="00:22:32.820" style="s2">hundred percent predetermined you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.960" end="00:22:34.380" style="s2">known saying it now you already chose</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.820" end="00:22:35.760" style="s2">before you came here versus like you</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.380" end="00:22:37.350" style="s2">have all the choice right now you can</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.760" end="00:22:41.670" style="s2">become anything you want to be and put</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.350" end="00:22:43.950" style="s2">on any persona um if it truly is a like</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.670" end="00:22:47.940" style="s2">I actually pick the no choice like I</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.950" end="00:22:49.950" style="s2">it&#39;s more empowering for me to know that</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.940" end="00:22:53.730" style="s2">everything happens really even if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.950" end="00:22:54.930" style="s2">not true then to imagine everyone as a</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.730" end="00:22:56.160" style="s2">hundred percent control and they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.930" end="00:22:59.190" style="s2">doing it right because they don&#39;t look</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.160" end="00:23:01.100" style="s2">like this perfect being that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.190" end="00:23:03.390" style="s2">obtainable and is into my world you</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.100" end="00:23:07.070" style="s2">wanting to be obtained because I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.390" end="00:23:10.140" style="s2">our purpose is a combination of our our</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.070" end="00:23:10.330" style="s2">shadow and our light our challenges and</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.140" end="00:23:12.820" style="s2">our</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.330" end="00:23:14.529" style="s2">talans and so if it&#39;s that that is the</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.820" end="00:23:16.330" style="s2">divert some young I&#39;m seeking the world</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.529" end="00:23:19.149" style="s2">and I think it solves everything</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.330" end="00:23:20.529" style="s2">then dictating what that diverse that</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.149" end="00:23:22.330" style="s2">like okay it&#39;s only allowed to be so</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.529" end="00:23:24.850" style="s2">diverse it&#39;s only allowed to be that</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.330" end="00:23:27.100" style="s2">like whatever I&#39;m given whatever I have</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.850" end="00:23:29.169" style="s2">here is exactly what&#39;s supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.100" end="00:23:33.100" style="s2">and then I can go from that space to do</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.169" end="00:23:35.169" style="s2">my biggest impact it&#39;s an easy or truth</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.100" end="00:23:37.870" style="s2">to live from for me because I can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.169" end="00:23:39.940" style="s2">my sister like I&#39;m tried like I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.870" end="00:23:42.159" style="s2">to do that part and it kept breaking</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.940" end="00:23:44.289" style="s2">down if it works for you it&#39;s easier</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.159" end="00:23:47.740" style="s2">right if you can be a charismatic</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.289" end="00:23:49.600" style="s2">speaker and be a type-a personality then</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.740" end="00:23:51.220" style="s2">there&#39;s something about that that makes</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.600" end="00:23:53.139" style="s2">life easier but then you don&#39;t get the</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.220" end="00:23:54.940" style="s2">challenges that bring you to your actual</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.139" end="00:23:57.039" style="s2">purpose and so that&#39;s it&#39;s like do you</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.940" end="00:24:01.659" style="s2">create your purpose or does it does it</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.039" end="00:24:04.510" style="s2">unfold in you and if you think you</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.659" end="00:24:08.370" style="s2">create it you might that can be it</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.510" end="00:24:12.279" style="s2">unfolding so it&#39;s it&#39;s it is like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.370" end="00:24:14.049" style="s2">mmm I&#39;m sorry to interrupt but the</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.279" end="00:24:16.299" style="s2">really interesting question as well is</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.049" end="00:24:18.070" style="s2">even if you are consciously choosing</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.299" end="00:24:20.080" style="s2">exactly who you&#39;re going to be on your</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.070" end="00:24:22.090" style="s2">journey through life but then the</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.080" end="00:24:24.519" style="s2">question then becomes where do the</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.090" end="00:24:26.350" style="s2">proclivities on which you base your</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.519" end="00:24:28.269" style="s2">choice why do you gravitate towards</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.350" end="00:24:30.700" style="s2">music rather than to the chemistry or</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.269" end="00:24:32.980" style="s2">whatever it might be right and so you</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.700" end="00:24:34.750" style="s2">know there then you are still guided by</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.980" end="00:24:37.149" style="s2">something mysterious even if you are</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.750" end="00:24:40.090" style="s2">really consciously taking control of and</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.149" end="00:24:41.559" style="s2">mapping out your life the way you map it</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.090" end="00:24:43.510" style="s2">out and the things you map it out</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.559" end="00:24:46.240" style="s2">towards those those choices are guided</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.510" end="00:24:48.880" style="s2">by something something mysterious and</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.240" end="00:24:51.220" style="s2">that you were probably born with in some</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.880" end="00:24:54.250" style="s2">fashion or another right so it is it is</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.220" end="00:24:56.230" style="s2">both and it&#39;s a it&#39;s a yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.250" end="00:24:59.830" style="s2">unfolding and the pushing yourself</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.230" end="00:25:01.750" style="s2">towards and submitting to and allowing</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.830" end="00:25:05.620" style="s2">to happen all at the same time kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.750" end="00:25:08.409" style="s2">thing I I can agree with a lot of what</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.620" end="00:25:11.320" style="s2">I&#39;ve heard and you know I&#39;ve I have been</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.409" end="00:25:13.960" style="s2">through periods in my life when I you</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.320" end="00:25:16.990" style="s2">know subscribe to the I signed up for</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.960" end="00:25:20.559" style="s2">everything or signed up for everything I</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.990" end="00:25:21.970" style="s2">you know before I came here I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.559" end="00:25:23.860" style="s2">where I stand with that right at the</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.970" end="00:25:25.510" style="s2">moment but</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.860" end="00:25:28.900" style="s2">as you were talking one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.510" end="00:25:33.640" style="s2">that came up is like I can&#39;t look there</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.900" end="00:25:37.900" style="s2">are things I can do to become like</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.640" end="00:25:39.730" style="s2">become anything I want but you know one</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.900" end="00:25:41.860" style="s2">of my teachers he would say he&#39;s like if</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.730" end="00:25:44.200" style="s2">I wanted to I could learn how to become</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.860" end="00:25:47.320" style="s2">a linebacker but it&#39;s not really in my</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.200" end="00:25:48.970" style="s2">nature to be a linebacker or it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.320" end="00:25:54.250" style="s2">you know or it&#39;s not in my nature to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.970" end="00:25:57.280" style="s2">a ballerina the you know that you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.250" end="00:26:02.260" style="s2">so I could I could decide to do</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.280" end="00:26:04.570" style="s2">something and there you know like it for</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.260" end="00:26:09.870" style="s2">me it doesn&#39;t feel like it&#39;s in my</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.570" end="00:26:14.410" style="s2">nature to like to be a loud boisterous</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.870" end="00:26:17.140" style="s2">like someone who&#39;s like up in you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.410" end="00:26:19.929" style="s2">like well not in my nature to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.140" end="00:26:21.910" style="s2">particularly funny either so like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.929" end="00:26:25.570" style="s2">not necessarily gonna become a stand-up</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.910" end="00:26:29.350" style="s2">comic because I I don&#39;t you know I tend</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.570" end="00:26:31.809" style="s2">to have a very a sense of humor that</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.350" end="00:26:36.429" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work for very many people most</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.809" end="00:26:39.910" style="s2">people don&#39;t find it funny I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.429" end="00:26:42.520" style="s2">agree you have no it&#39;s not in your</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.910" end="00:26:44.919" style="s2">nature to be a linebacker and so but</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.520" end="00:26:46.690" style="s2">then why would you pursue being a</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.919" end="00:26:48.160" style="s2">Lineback that&#39;s that&#39;s the question I</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.690" end="00:26:50.740" style="s2">would then have to ask you right what</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.160" end="00:26:53.320" style="s2">what if it&#39;s not in your nature why</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.740" end="00:26:55.150" style="s2">would you be drawn to it that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.320" end="00:26:56.830" style="s2">I think is what a guide to what our</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.150" end="00:27:01.480" style="s2">nature is is that which we are drawn to</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.830" end="00:27:03.220" style="s2">right does that make sense yeah yeah one</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.480" end="00:27:05.860" style="s2">of the one of the thoughts that came up</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.220" end="00:27:08.919" style="s2">for me was I have a friend he&#39;s a male</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.860" end="00:27:13.750" style="s2">friend he&#39;s quite you know someone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.919" end="00:27:17.290" style="s2">who&#39;s quite small in stature and he was</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.750" end="00:27:20.169" style="s2">drawn towards football in high school</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.290" end="00:27:23.919" style="s2">and like ended up causing his body a lot</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.169" end="00:27:28.240" style="s2">of damage because he felt like that was</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.919" end="00:27:30.910" style="s2">the only way to prove that he was a like</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.240" end="00:27:34.090" style="s2">he was drawn to it as a to prove</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.910" end="00:27:37.600" style="s2">something yeah so extrinsically drawn</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.090" end="00:27:39.460" style="s2">rather than intrinsically drawn right</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.600" end="00:27:41.770" style="s2">and I love that distinction of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.460" end="00:27:43.960" style="s2">extrinsic Lee versus intrinsically like</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.770" end="00:27:46.450" style="s2">I think so many people are drawn to</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.960" end="00:27:48.850" style="s2">things extrinsic Lee like I there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.450" end="00:27:50.950" style="s2">lot of things that I have been pulled to</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.850" end="00:27:53.380" style="s2">not because they were something that I</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.950" end="00:27:56.500" style="s2">was I was drawn towards but because I</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.380" end="00:28:00.010" style="s2">had this voice in me I had this thing in</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.500" end="00:28:02.679" style="s2">me saying I should do this and I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.010" end="00:28:05.530" style="s2">know that I was being driven by that</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.679" end="00:28:07.240" style="s2">voice this takes is so nicely back to</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.530" end="00:28:09.400" style="s2">the actual question right of what is my</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.240" end="00:28:11.350" style="s2">purpose because discovering what your</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.400" end="00:28:13.210" style="s2">purpose is not the purposes that the</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.350" end="00:28:15.970" style="s2">world would have you undertake right but</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.210" end="00:28:19.210" style="s2">your purpose that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.970" end="00:28:22.179" style="s2">part of it right yeah no absolutely it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.210" end="00:28:24.130" style="s2">like the intrinsic versus extrinsic</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.179" end="00:28:26.710" style="s2">RZA&#39;s extrinsic I can&#39;t say the other</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.130" end="00:28:29.110" style="s2">word at the moment motivation is like</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.710" end="00:28:31.090" style="s2">even if it&#39;s intrinsic in you if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.110" end="00:28:34.450" style="s2">something that is normally externally</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.090" end="00:28:37.000" style="s2">motivated you get put in with everybody</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.450" end="00:28:39.669" style="s2">else right if your calling is to be a</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.000" end="00:28:41.860" style="s2">doctor and you&#39;re a doctor for an</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.669" end="00:28:43.299" style="s2">intrinsic I want to heal people and and</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.860" end="00:28:45.220" style="s2">yet all the people you&#39;re in med school</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.299" end="00:28:46.330" style="s2">with and doctors with are the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.220" end="00:28:47.409" style="s2">are there because their parents said</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.330" end="00:28:49.690" style="s2">they were good at science and this is</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.409" end="00:28:51.730" style="s2">what they do you&#39;re not gonna stand out</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.690" end="00:28:53.230" style="s2">as a healer in that because it&#39;s what is</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.730" end="00:28:54.610" style="s2">extrinsically there and it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.230" end="00:28:57.700" style="s2">with like the linebacker when I wrote</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.610" end="00:29:00.299" style="s2">down like if it was just natural that we</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.700" end="00:29:03.400" style="s2">all had to go to into gymnastics and</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.299" end="00:29:05.650" style="s2">really young age we would get the best</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.400" end="00:29:07.270" style="s2">gymnasts out of it but that doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.650" end="00:29:10.210" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna be the best gymnast</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.270" end="00:29:12.340" style="s2">like we&#39;re gonna get the best gold medal</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.210" end="00:29:13.990" style="s2">athletes but it doesn&#39;t mean that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.340" end="00:29:15.520" style="s2">all meant to be gymnast even if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.990" end="00:29:16.990" style="s2">something that society says no no this</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.520" end="00:29:20.169" style="s2">is just what we did was like everyone</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.990" end="00:29:21.850" style="s2">goes into this and figuring those pieces</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.169" end="00:29:23.320" style="s2">of society oh am I doing this because</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.850" end="00:29:25.059" style="s2">society wants me to do it or because</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.320" end="00:29:27.520" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna bring power and privilege or</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.059" end="00:29:29.140" style="s2">or and money or am i doing it because</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.520" end="00:29:31.090" style="s2">this is truly what I want to do and</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.140" end="00:29:33.490" style="s2">that&#39;s my point of like society&#39;s path</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.090" end="00:29:36.130" style="s2">versus your own if they lead in the same</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.490" end="00:29:38.500" style="s2">direction it&#39;s not a problem if they</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.130" end="00:29:43.539" style="s2">lead in opposite directions if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.500" end="00:29:45.130" style="s2">doctor or you know shaman like you have</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.539" end="00:29:47.740" style="s2">to choose and so it&#39;s like it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.130" end="00:29:50.070" style="s2">it&#39;s on and always shoot your internal</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.740" end="00:29:52.470" style="s2">one even if society is saying like</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.070" end="00:29:54.990" style="s2">why would you become a shaman there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.470" end="00:29:57.030" style="s2">anything in this instead of this one and</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.990" end="00:30:00.630" style="s2">so the intrinsic versus extrinsic is</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.030" end="00:30:03.810" style="s2">huge it is also incredibly difficult</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.630" end="00:30:05.490" style="s2">sometimes to disentangle the external</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.810" end="00:30:07.620" style="s2">world&#39;s expectations of you from your</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.490" end="00:30:09.750" style="s2">own expectations and wishes for yourself</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.620" end="00:30:11.400" style="s2">right there they&#39;re they&#39;re deeply</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.750" end="00:30:14.910" style="s2">intertwined been exposed to it all for a</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.400" end="00:30:16.740" style="s2">long time well it struck me it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.910" end="00:30:18.420" style="s2">interesting example do you believe you</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.740" end="00:30:21.930" style="s2">know a doctor and a shaman because</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.420" end="00:30:24.450" style="s2">they&#39;re both healers thought that was</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.930" end="00:30:26.760" style="s2">just an interesting one but yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.450" end="00:30:30.750" style="s2">that thing about having you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.760" end="00:30:32.250" style="s2">like am I am I doing something am i</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.750" end="00:30:34.950" style="s2">doing something because it&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.250" end="00:30:39.390" style="s2">supposed to do person versus something</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.950" end="00:30:43.320" style="s2">that is what I want to do and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.390" end="00:30:46.230" style="s2">also the am I doing something because</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.320" end="00:30:49.440" style="s2">it&#39;s what&#39;s rewarded by the culture I</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.230" end="00:30:51.000" style="s2">live in versus it being something that I</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.440" end="00:30:55.200" style="s2">want when those two things are together</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.000" end="00:30:58.890" style="s2">like for my husband he has you know he</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.200" end="00:31:01.440" style="s2">is deeply intrinsically motivated to do</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.890" end="00:31:05.040" style="s2">something that is very highly rewarded</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.440" end="00:31:08.760" style="s2">by our culture and so like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.040" end="00:31:12.300" style="s2">something that like and it&#39;s been very</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.760" end="00:31:14.940" style="s2">frustrating for me at times because like</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.300" end="00:31:16.260" style="s2">when we when we first got together I you</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.940" end="00:31:18.060" style="s2">know he&#39;s an engineer and I was an</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.260" end="00:31:20.940" style="s2">engineer at the time and he just</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.060" end="00:31:23.130" style="s2">naturally like was was drawn towards</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.940" end="00:31:26.900" style="s2">solving all those problems and studying</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.130" end="00:31:29.430" style="s2">more and I wasn&#39;t I went into it because</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.900" end="00:31:33.810" style="s2">it was a suggestion because I was good</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.430" end="00:31:38.150" style="s2">at it and so I couldn&#39;t no matter how</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.810" end="00:31:41.700" style="s2">hard I tried motivate myself to do it</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.150" end="00:31:44.280" style="s2">and I thought that was that meant there</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.700" end="00:31:47.010" style="s2">was something wrong with me because like</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.280" end="00:31:51.470" style="s2">I didn&#39;t I couldn&#39;t distinguish the fact</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.010" end="00:31:51.470" style="s2">that it was someone else&#39;s purpose</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.230" end="00:31:57.990" style="s2">teal swans one of the people that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.120" end="00:32:02.750" style="s2">enjoyed listening to and not very gamy</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.990" end="00:32:04.760" style="s2">but very okay and one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.750" end="00:32:05.870" style="s2">that she talks about Mike one of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.760" end="00:32:08.930" style="s2">conditions I have which is chronic</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.870" end="00:32:11.000" style="s2">fatigue her spiritual understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.930" end="00:32:11.630" style="s2">it is that it&#39;s a manifestation in your</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.000" end="00:32:13.490" style="s2">body</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.630" end="00:32:16.670" style="s2">I&#39;m chronically needing to do what you</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.490" end="00:32:18.290" style="s2">don&#39;t want to do and there was even</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.670" end="00:32:19.220" style="s2">though I liked yours after I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.290" end="00:32:20.570" style="s2">I would have been able to handle that</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.220" end="00:32:21.680" style="s2">when I first got diagnosed but now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.570" end="00:32:23.690" style="s2">like oh yeah I know that that resonates</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.680" end="00:32:25.640" style="s2">like I love it yeah because it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.690" end="00:32:27.500" style="s2">what society says you have to do this</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.640" end="00:32:29.360" style="s2">right to be a mom you have to do X Y &amp; Z</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.500" end="00:32:31.490" style="s2">to be a daughter you have to do X Y &amp; Z</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.360" end="00:32:33.950" style="s2">and if it&#39;s not internally motivated</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.490" end="00:32:35.150" style="s2">it&#39;s like there&#39;s no energy there for it</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.950" end="00:32:38.090" style="s2">and when you&#39;re as a woman especially</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.150" end="00:32:39.530" style="s2">there&#39;s so much of that put on you that</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.090" end="00:32:40.790" style="s2">when you don&#39;t have any internal</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.530" end="00:32:41.960" style="s2">guidance you don&#39;t know you&#39;re even</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.790" end="00:32:43.070" style="s2">supposed to listen to your internal</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.960" end="00:32:45.140" style="s2">guide it&#39;s like this is why I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.070" end="00:32:46.850" style="s2">universe gave me it so I had to listen</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.140" end="00:32:48.830" style="s2">to my internal goddess there was no less</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.850" end="00:32:50.360" style="s2">things outside like until you figure out</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.830" end="00:32:53.570" style="s2">your internal and what you&#39;re here to do</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.360" end="00:32:55.130" style="s2">and what will have energy for don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.570" end="00:32:56.840" style="s2">spend energy and all that it&#39;s a weird</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.130" end="00:33:00.050" style="s2">balance to try and fight for me hanging</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.840" end="00:33:02.530" style="s2">by what is what is here that is mine to</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.050" end="00:33:04.700" style="s2">do what is my purpose what is that</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.530" end="00:33:06.950" style="s2">letting go of all the I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.700" end="00:33:09.410" style="s2">to do in a society that very much</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.950" end="00:33:10.370" style="s2">propagates on of course you have to do</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.410" end="00:33:13.970" style="s2">everything you don&#39;t want to do that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.370" end="00:33:21.230" style="s2">system that&#39;s life I think we all have</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.970" end="00:33:23.750" style="s2">to do all day all of these I have to</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.230" end="00:33:28.550" style="s2">agree with everything I&#39;m hearing just</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.750" end="00:33:34.000" style="s2">sounds great and resonates what I what I</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.550" end="00:33:36.020" style="s2">think is game a has been very male</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.000" end="00:33:40.160" style="s2">dominant male</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.020" end="00:33:43.370" style="s2">I don&#39;t know set up for that external</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.160" end="00:33:45.920" style="s2">motivation and I think that game be or</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.370" end="00:33:47.750" style="s2">where we&#39;re moving towards you can call</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.920" end="00:33:49.100" style="s2">it whatever is mark feminine so I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.750" end="00:33:53.180" style="s2">we need a balance in both of those</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.100" end="00:33:56.150" style="s2">external edge and internal systems that</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.180" end="00:34:00.980" style="s2">value being driven in either/or way</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.150" end="00:34:02.900" style="s2">because currently most systems or the</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.980" end="00:34:05.660" style="s2">way that we raise society children from</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.900" end="00:34:08.510" style="s2">the bottom all the way up is externally</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.660" end="00:34:10.970" style="s2">driven and so of course we can&#39;t figure</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.510" end="00:34:13.669" style="s2">out is that my mind or society&#39;s mind</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.970" end="00:34:15.710" style="s2">that&#39;s telling me I should do X Y &amp; Z I</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.669" end="00:34:16.370" style="s2">feel like that&#39;s why it&#39;s so important</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.710" end="00:34:20.510" style="s2">for us to</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.370" end="00:34:23.210" style="s2">you be creating this new system new way</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.510" end="00:34:25.910" style="s2">of being a new way to value our internal</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.210" end="00:34:27.800" style="s2">and what drives us internally because I</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.910" end="00:34:31.010" style="s2">think that they&#39;re both valid and I</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.800" end="00:34:33.650" style="s2">think that both men and women need both</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.010" end="00:34:36.770" style="s2">parts of this within us to really</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.650" end="00:34:39.530" style="s2">fulfill a third largest purpose our best</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.770" end="00:34:41.000" style="s2">self in the world needs to have the</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.530" end="00:34:45.790" style="s2">understanding of that internal</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.000" end="00:34:45.790" style="s2">motivation and also have external agent</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.690" end="00:34:53.690" style="s2">I really like that silo and that brought</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.910" end="00:34:55.460" style="s2">up something I&#39;m really interested in</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.690" end="00:34:58.880" style="s2">John Verve a key and he has a language</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.460" end="00:35:02.960" style="s2">around it of the that as a culture we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.880" end="00:35:04.760" style="s2">confused something having mode versus</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.960" end="00:35:07.070" style="s2">being mode and I wouldn&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.760" end="00:35:09.200" style="s2">say one is masculine once feminine is</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.070" end="00:35:12.950" style="s2">just one two different modes of being</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.200" end="00:35:16.910" style="s2">and like we&#39;ve confused being mature</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.950" end="00:35:20.320" style="s2">with having a car payment like because I</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.910" end="00:35:24.350" style="s2">have a car car payment I&#39;m mature versus</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.320" end="00:35:25.940" style="s2">being a mature person and he gives a</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.350" end="00:35:30.380" style="s2">couple more examples of that but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.940" end="00:35:34.580" style="s2">like yeah it&#39;s getting getting back to</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.380" end="00:35:40.040" style="s2">kind of okay this difference between</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.580" end="00:35:43.670" style="s2">like I have to have a career to be wise</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.040" end="00:35:45.800" style="s2">like no like just because somebody has a</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.670" end="00:35:47.990" style="s2">career does not mean they&#39;re wise by any</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.800" end="00:35:51.140" style="s2">stretch of the imagination and so how do</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.990" end="00:35:55.550" style="s2">we like and so that&#39;s like how do I</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.140" end="00:36:03.320" style="s2">recognize when I&#39;m in having mode versus</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.550" end="00:36:11.750" style="s2">like being mode let&#39;s I just want to</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.320" end="00:36:13.970" style="s2">invite Hank thanks I&#39;m listening a lot</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.750" end="00:36:15.980" style="s2">of interesting things and I kind of just</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.970" end="00:36:18.920" style="s2">taking notes but there&#39;s a there&#39;s a few</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.980" end="00:36:21.110" style="s2">things that jump out at me and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.920" end="00:36:23.240" style="s2">the time when you look at the the my</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.110" end="00:36:25.880" style="s2">dad&#39;s a personality and I always kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.240" end="00:36:29.290" style="s2">looked up at him and try to follow in</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.880" end="00:36:31.360" style="s2">his footsteps the only thing is he is</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.290" end="00:36:33.760" style="s2">thirty forty years older than I am and I</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.360" end="00:36:36.160" style="s2">always compare back to it so I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.760" end="00:36:38.350" style="s2">struggle with that same internal dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.160" end="00:36:41.530" style="s2">that Jubilee that you mentioned in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.350" end="00:36:44.140" style="s2">beginning but also what I found is that</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.530" end="00:36:47.200" style="s2">he he had a very strong push for me to</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.140" end="00:36:49.720" style="s2">genie certain sports and if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.200" end="00:36:52.540" style="s2">TV and adverts yeah you need the new</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.720" end="00:36:54.450" style="s2">stick or the new hockey ball or that and</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.540" end="00:36:57.520" style="s2">then you&#39;ll play ten times better which</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.450" end="00:37:00.310" style="s2">then a lot of the time we think a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.520" end="00:37:02.260" style="s2">scrap because I would let&#39;s say play</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.310" end="00:37:05.440" style="s2">crickets and I say but I&#39;m not good at</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.260" end="00:37:07.210" style="s2">it so maybe I need a bat so cricket bad</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.440" end="00:37:10.810" style="s2">to look good in a certain way which very</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.210" end="00:37:13.150" style="s2">much do the external environment and I</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.810" end="00:37:17.230" style="s2">never really enjoyed it myself where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.150" end="00:37:19.540" style="s2">more artistic I like yoga and I did</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.230" end="00:37:22.000" style="s2">karate when I was younger and I I was</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.540" end="00:37:24.370" style="s2">added a little bit of dancing and a lot</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.000" end="00:37:25.870" style="s2">of kids really got into my character at</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.370" end="00:37:28.300" style="s2">that point and I and I and I really</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.870" end="00:37:30.630" style="s2">stopped doing a lot of that which talks</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.300" end="00:37:34.270" style="s2">a little bit to clear us that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.630" end="00:37:37.000" style="s2">shoes and want so what do I want to do</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.270" end="00:37:41.020" style="s2">but a lot of people sometimes choose for</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.000" end="00:37:43.840" style="s2">you by littling or not allowing you to</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.020" end="00:37:45.700" style="s2">really step into that so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.840" end="00:37:48.550" style="s2">there is a component of society that</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.700" end="00:37:51.520" style="s2">comes in to say yes you as you are</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.550" end="00:37:54.910" style="s2">allowed to do this or that and I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.520" end="00:37:57.610" style="s2">we do develop some certain props one</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.910" end="00:38:01.060" style="s2">might be if I want to talk to someone on</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.610" end="00:38:03.190" style="s2">the street I put on sunglasses so it</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.060" end="00:38:05.290" style="s2">allows me to be there but not be there</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.190" end="00:38:07.930" style="s2">and I can actually walk or I can put up</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.290" end="00:38:09.520" style="s2">a headset or something or so or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.930" end="00:38:11.860" style="s2">have a cigarette and I can stand in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.520" end="00:38:13.270" style="s2">corner in a busy being buzzy remove and</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.860" end="00:38:16.330" style="s2">I can smoke my cigarettes and people</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.270" end="00:38:19.240" style="s2">would think the sky is very insightful</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.330" end="00:38:22.330" style="s2">and he&#39;s a deep thinker rather than</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.240" end="00:38:24.070" style="s2">saying oh cheesy he&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.330" end="00:38:26.350" style="s2">awkward at this party and we actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.070" end="00:38:30.430" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t invite him again it&#39;s creating</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.350" end="00:38:33.250" style="s2">those and and we actually created them</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.430" end="00:38:35.470" style="s2">as we go and and it and it happens but</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.250" end="00:38:37.840" style="s2">other time with a certain break that</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.470" end="00:38:39.490" style="s2">happens within our life like we going</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.840" end="00:38:42.260" style="s2">through the coronavirus everyone staying</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.490" end="00:38:45.020" style="s2">at home and now we&#39;re connecting</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.260" end="00:38:48.170" style="s2">via Skype resume or in a different way</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.020" end="00:38:51.620" style="s2">going forward we all decided to go ahead</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.170" end="00:38:54.260" style="s2">in this way so it&#39;s it&#39;s very much in</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.620" end="00:38:55.790" style="s2">our own lives as well you were</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.260" end="00:38:59.870" style="s2">mentioning in terms of we&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.790" end="00:39:02.150" style="s2">striving towards doing something but I</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.870" end="00:39:04.210" style="s2">think I wanted to follow my dad in his</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.150" end="00:39:07.040" style="s2">footsteps and I and I keep on failing</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.210" end="00:39:09.320" style="s2">consistently and it&#39;s very much you get</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.040" end="00:39:11.480" style="s2">to insert an existential crisis that</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.320" end="00:39:14.980" style="s2">kind of says no this is definitely not</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.480" end="00:39:17.270" style="s2">my other way I&#39;m going to and then you</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.980" end="00:39:20.810" style="s2">and I think it&#39;s sometimes a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.270" end="00:39:23.060" style="s2">click as well do you say finding that</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.810" end="00:39:25.790" style="s2">certain sense of wow this is really neat</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.060" end="00:39:29.060" style="s2">and this is really what I want to do and</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.790" end="00:39:30.530" style="s2">this is my my path but I I I also think</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.060" end="00:39:33.410" style="s2">that there&#39;s a certain sense they call</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.530" end="00:39:36.320" style="s2">it a divine timing that it will come</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.410" end="00:39:39.950" style="s2">across your path it&#39;s and you might</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.320" end="00:39:42.560" style="s2">suffer for it until that point but being</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.950" end="00:39:47.840" style="s2">open to you that makes that time a</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.560" end="00:39:49.430" style="s2">little bit shorter as well and I and I</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.840" end="00:39:51.560" style="s2">do you think balances are quite</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.430" end="00:39:54.680" style="s2">important one internal balance in terms</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.560" end="00:39:58.040" style="s2">of what are Qatar am I actually playing</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.680" end="00:40:00.830" style="s2">into do I have an internal sense of</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.040" end="00:40:02.450" style="s2">balance of am i externally validated am</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.830" end="00:40:04.990" style="s2">i internally validating what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.450" end="00:40:09.110" style="s2">actually getting from this this internal</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.990" end="00:40:11.060" style="s2">sense of this joy mechanism of I enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.110" end="00:40:13.460" style="s2">what I&#39;m doing and this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.060" end="00:40:18.140" style="s2">really resonating with me so I I think</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.460" end="00:40:24.890" style="s2">some way you find your place but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.140" end="00:40:27.410" style="s2">it&#39;s a lot of trial and error yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.890" end="00:40:29.300" style="s2">it&#39;s a lot of introspection and honesty</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.410" end="00:40:31.310" style="s2">with self as well right well you were</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.300" end="00:40:34.610" style="s2">saying about the following in your</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.310" end="00:40:36.320" style="s2">father&#39;s footsteps thing it&#39;s a it</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.610" end="00:40:38.480" style="s2">wasn&#39;t for me it wasn&#39;t my father as my</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.320" end="00:40:41.090" style="s2">mother was the sort of you know the big</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.480" end="00:40:42.070" style="s2">figure in my in my childhood that I had</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.090" end="00:40:44.120" style="s2">that I had to break free from</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.070" end="00:40:45.530" style="s2">psychologically I mean I&#39;m a lot older</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.120" end="00:40:47.840" style="s2">than you right so this is that this is a</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.530" end="00:40:50.060" style="s2">long time ago for me but it is Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.840" end="00:40:52.910" style="s2">Peterson talks really well about this I</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.060" end="00:40:54.710" style="s2">I know that he antagonizes a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.910" end="00:40:55.690" style="s2">women in particular but I think he</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.710" end="00:40:57.309" style="s2">speaks really well</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.690" end="00:40:59.200" style="s2">this about the death and rebirth that</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.309" end="00:41:01.559" style="s2">you know when you do change paths in</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.200" end="00:41:03.789" style="s2">your life it is a form of dying and</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.559" end="00:41:09.880" style="s2">putting yourself back together again in</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.789" end="00:41:11.980" style="s2">a new form right and that it&#39;s really so</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.880" end="00:41:14.260" style="s2">there&#39;s the part of you that dies and</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.980" end="00:41:16.119" style="s2">then there&#39;s the new you which is reborn</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.260" end="00:41:19.450" style="s2">but then there&#39;s another part of you</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.119" end="00:41:21.400" style="s2">which watches the death and the rebirth</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.450" end="00:41:23.980" style="s2">right and it&#39;s and it&#39;s that part you</p>

<p begin="00:41:23.980" end="00:41:29.020" style="s2">that&#39;s what carries you across the</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.920" end="00:41:34.990" style="s2">valley you know what I mean as it is</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.020" end="00:41:36.880" style="s2">that bit of you yeah and I think we</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.990" end="00:41:39.700" style="s2">don&#39;t really get introduced to that but</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.880" end="00:41:42.339" style="s2">until you go through a few crisis in</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.700" end="00:41:45.210" style="s2">your life I kind of get to the point</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.339" end="00:41:47.380" style="s2">where you can trust those elements hmm</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.210" end="00:41:48.700" style="s2">well it&#39;s usually crisis that brings</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.380" end="00:41:51.789" style="s2">about transformation is its</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.700" end="00:41:53.230" style="s2">transformations that you know that</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.789" end="00:41:55.690" style="s2">requires the death and the rebirth but</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.230" end="00:41:58.210" style="s2">transformation is almost always prompted</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.690" end="00:42:00.520" style="s2">by crisis and so it&#39;s easy to conflate</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.210" end="00:42:02.470" style="s2">the two we need crisis to motivate us to</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.520" end="00:42:04.270" style="s2">change right we don&#39;t change when things</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.470" end="00:42:06.369" style="s2">when everything&#39;s rosy or everything&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.270" end="00:42:09.099" style="s2">kind of okay we you know we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.369" end="00:42:11.140" style="s2">motivated to to make the to make the</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.099" end="00:42:12.700" style="s2">difficult changes the unknown is always</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.140" end="00:42:14.230" style="s2">scary right even if you know it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.700" end="00:42:17.230" style="s2">be better it&#39;s still scary</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.230" end="00:42:21.160" style="s2">because it&#39;s unknown I might disagree</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.230" end="00:42:26.140" style="s2">with you Eric that that crisis is needed</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.160" end="00:42:26.140" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.029" end="00:42:33.309" style="s2">we have lost connection to ret to rites</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.210" end="00:42:35.980" style="s2">of passage and I wonder would would</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.309" end="00:42:39.069" style="s2">crises be as not saying that crises</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.980" end="00:42:42.309" style="s2">aren&#39;t you know aren&#39;t an important you</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.069" end="00:42:44.760" style="s2">know an important crucible but if we had</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.309" end="00:42:46.599" style="s2">rites of passage would that necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.760" end="00:42:49.000" style="s2">necessitate that we had to have the</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.599" end="00:42:50.200" style="s2">crises we would have far fewer crises if</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.000" end="00:42:51.910" style="s2">we had proper rites of passage</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.200" end="00:42:53.529" style="s2">absolutely we would experience far fewer</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.910" end="00:42:55.750" style="s2">psychological crises absolutely I</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.529" end="00:42:58.240" style="s2">couldn&#39;t agree more if I know in my own</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.750" end="00:43:00.670" style="s2">life when I&#39;ve some of the crises I have</p>

<p begin="00:43:04.059" end="00:43:08.790" style="s2">this a crisis so I&#39;m turning it into a</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.339" end="00:43:11.400" style="s2">crisis as opposed to it actually off</p>

<p begin="00:43:19.740" end="00:43:23.130" style="s2">relationship like looking for the</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.600" end="00:43:24.750" style="s2">internal truth as opposed to the</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.130" end="00:43:27.240" style="s2">external what this should look like and</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.750" end="00:43:28.920" style="s2">just being it like like okay am I trying</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.240" end="00:43:32.100" style="s2">to be something or my actually beingness</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.920" end="00:43:34.170" style="s2">and what I got out of your sharing hang</p>

<p begin="00:43:34.170" end="00:43:37.710" style="s2">piece of needing to be good at something</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.580" end="00:43:39.180" style="s2">to trying it is huge in our society</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.710" end="00:43:41.760" style="s2">there&#39;s a ton of things that aren&#39;t mine</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.180" end="00:43:43.680" style="s2">cuz I&#39;m not good at them sports I also</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.760" end="00:43:46.680" style="s2">don&#39;t enjoy them but there&#39;s ones that I</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.680" end="00:43:49.260" style="s2">do enjoy that I probably would do if it</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.680" end="00:43:50.460" style="s2">was okay to fail at them and it is it is</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.260" end="00:43:52.830" style="s2">okay to fail I&#39;m giving myself</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.460" end="00:43:57.420" style="s2">permission like that need to yoga fail</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.830" end="00:44:00.960" style="s2">and also the internal external part you</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.420" end="00:44:02.970" style="s2">have a purpose truly your essential</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.960" end="00:44:06.990" style="s2">purpose that requires an external</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.970" end="00:44:08.550" style="s2">motivation so like my kid future who she</p>

<p begin="00:44:44.250" end="00:44:49.350" style="s2">might be the last time like it&#39;s and it</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.090" end="00:44:52.170" style="s2">happens also in the not-for-profit</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.350" end="00:44:54.060" style="s2">sector like it&#39;s likely you ask me what</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.170" end="00:44:55.860" style="s2">their purpose it&#39;s like to feed the</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.060" end="00:44:57.560" style="s2">starving children it&#39;s like okay well</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.860" end="00:45:01.650" style="s2">what if we&#39;re having children</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.560" end="00:45:04.170" style="s2">what if we actually fixed that the</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.650" end="00:45:05.100" style="s2">external needs to be broken so that you</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.170" end="00:45:08.520" style="s2">can fix it</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.100" end="00:45:10.230" style="s2">isn&#39;t that your purpose cuz yeah I feel</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.520" end="00:45:11.790" style="s2">that Figaro&#39;s our purpose if it&#39;s fixed</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.230" end="00:45:17.280" style="s2">by someone else it&#39;s like there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.790" end="00:45:20.850" style="s2">other need there that person very</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.280" end="00:45:21.980" style="s2">interesting question I like that so so</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.850" end="00:45:24.140" style="s2">what would</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.980" end="00:45:25.430" style="s2">what would be your broader purpose in</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.140" end="00:45:26.810" style="s2">the in the children and their that I</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.430" end="00:45:28.580" style="s2">want to push back a little bit on the</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.810" end="00:45:32.750" style="s2">gold medal thing in a second but before</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.580" end="00:45:34.250" style="s2">I do the children the saving starving</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.750" end="00:45:36.740" style="s2">children example that you gave if there</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.250" end="00:45:38.390" style="s2">are no starving children so the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.740" end="00:45:39.770" style="s2">person that would be driven in this</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.390" end="00:45:41.650" style="s2">world where there are starving children</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.770" end="00:45:43.970" style="s2">to go and help those starving children</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.650" end="00:45:45.530" style="s2">what kind of thing in a world where</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.970" end="00:45:47.180" style="s2">there were no starving children what</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.530" end="00:45:50.470" style="s2">kind of thing would that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.180" end="00:45:54.369" style="s2">personality do you think be drawn to</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.470" end="00:45:54.369" style="s2">that&#39;s a really good question I think</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.940" end="00:45:58.850" style="s2">it&#39;s why are you helping the starving</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.859" end="00:46:00.440" style="s2">children is it because you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.850" end="00:46:02.000" style="s2">children to suffer maybe you go into</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.440" end="00:46:05.060" style="s2">childcare baby you know what I mean is</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.000" end="00:46:07.790" style="s2">it because you want prestige but I mean</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.060" end="00:46:11.150" style="s2">like what is the thing you&#39;re seeking</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.790" end="00:46:13.850" style="s2">here it&#39;s like what are you seeking here</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.150" end="00:46:15.410" style="s2">if you need adoring fans we can&#39;t if</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.850" end="00:46:17.900" style="s2">there&#39;s only so many adoring fans to go</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.410" end="00:46:20.630" style="s2">around one is for your voice to be heard</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.900" end="00:46:22.820" style="s2">not just sing you know not you like</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.630" end="00:46:24.890" style="s2">nearly anyone can have but you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.820" end="00:46:27.410" style="s2">necessarily have 40,000 people watching</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.890" end="00:46:29.510" style="s2">you do it unless you&#39;re good enough and</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.410" end="00:46:31.670" style="s2">that&#39;s like that everyone can do</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.510" end="00:46:33.230" style="s2">something but only then good enough</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.670" end="00:46:34.940" style="s2">people are gonna get the fans and the</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.230" end="00:46:36.470" style="s2">accolades and that but if that is one</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.940" end="00:46:39.650" style="s2">reason for doing it in the first place</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.470" end="00:46:41.150" style="s2">it hurts the very purpose like yeah this</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.650" end="00:46:42.500" style="s2">is a really good example of something</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.150" end="00:46:46.280" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to be good at to really</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.500" end="00:46:47.810" style="s2">enjoy having really really excellent</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.280" end="00:46:50.060" style="s2">example can I just push back a little</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.810" end="00:46:51.980" style="s2">bit on the Sports example though on the</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.060" end="00:46:54.980" style="s2">gold medal thing so you know if your</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.980" end="00:46:56.570" style="s2">purpose is running or high jump or</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.980" end="00:47:01.700" style="s2">whatever it might be right you just love</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.570" end="00:47:03.619" style="s2">doing it the whole structure of you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.700" end="00:47:06.710" style="s2">games and Olympic Games and gold medals</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.619" end="00:47:09.050" style="s2">and all of that kind of thing I think if</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.710" end="00:47:10.760" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s not contradictory right your</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.050" end="00:47:12.740" style="s2">purpose was never to win a gold medal</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.760" end="00:47:16.609" style="s2">your purpose was to run but the gold</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.740" end="00:47:18.830" style="s2">medal is by seat by chasing after that</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.609" end="00:47:20.570" style="s2">gold medal you are going to be running</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.830" end="00:47:22.490" style="s2">against the best other runners that will</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.570" end="00:47:24.050" style="s2">push you on to be a the best runner you</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.490" end="00:47:25.880" style="s2">could possibly be because only in direct</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.050" end="00:47:27.200" style="s2">competition especially in things like</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.880" end="00:47:28.910" style="s2">that right only in direct competition</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.200" end="00:47:31.940" style="s2">with others can you really push yourself</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.910" end="00:47:33.950" style="s2">to your maximum maximum heights and so I</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.940" end="00:47:34.910" style="s2">think that they can complement each</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.950" end="00:47:37.430" style="s2">other as the point</p>

<p begin="00:49:39.890" end="00:49:48.300" style="s2">little littler smaller goals within that</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.460" end="00:49:50.070" style="s2">larger goal but that larger goal is</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.300" end="00:49:52.680" style="s2">so big you&#39;ll never you know it&#39;s like</p>

<p begin="00:50:39.330" end="00:50:48.240" style="s2">like I am identified as wanting you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.380" end="00:50:54.770" style="s2">I&#39;m I&#39;m striving towards looking like a</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.240" end="00:51:00.900" style="s2">particular thing versus striving towards</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.770" end="00:51:02.790" style="s2">being a being something yeah and I think</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.900" end="00:51:05.610" style="s2">that would go back to that thing about</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.790" end="00:51:08.190" style="s2">having it&#39;s like having people direction</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.610" end="00:51:10.830" style="s2">rather than the destination having</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.190" end="00:51:21.930" style="s2">people see me in a particular way versus</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.830" end="00:51:25.040" style="s2">being a particular way there&#39;s a test</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.930" end="00:51:28.280" style="s2">that you can do that that looks at your</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.040" end="00:51:31.980" style="s2">your preferred way of going about life</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.280" end="00:51:33.930" style="s2">what is your natural inclination it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.980" end="00:51:36.750" style="s2">called the cane I test and it and it</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.930" end="00:51:39.150" style="s2">breaks your your mind up into you 3</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.750" end="00:51:41.160" style="s2">elements it looks at your your left in</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.150" end="00:51:44.090" style="s2">your right brain and then it looks at</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.160" end="00:51:48.930" style="s2">your prefrontal cortex in your when you</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.090" end="00:51:51.600" style="s2">how much behind it and it does a test in</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.930" end="00:51:54.360" style="s2">terms of where you lie there but at a</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.600" end="00:51:56.490" style="s2">very high level you have people who they</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.360" end="00:51:59.580" style="s2">ask the full following questions people</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.490" end="00:52:01.050" style="s2">who ask what is very much focused on</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.580" end="00:52:03.390" style="s2">what he wants</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.050" end="00:52:07.320" style="s2">how do you want to approach that</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.390" end="00:52:09.390" style="s2">the there is a very component that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.320" end="00:52:13.530" style="s2">connected to people who is connected to</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.390" end="00:52:16.620" style="s2">you the who so who is part of this who</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.530" end="00:52:18.560" style="s2">does what then we have the how so people</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.620" end="00:52:21.660" style="s2">want to put structure around things and</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.560" end="00:52:23.520" style="s2">then the last one is people ask why why</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.660" end="00:52:25.350" style="s2">are we doing this so what is the</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.520" end="00:52:28.650" style="s2">application to this and they they very</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.350" end="00:52:32.010" style="s2">much look into the future and what I</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.650" end="00:52:35.010" style="s2">think is it&#39;s quite difficult to you I</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.010" end="00:52:37.350" style="s2">think by doing tests like that you kind</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.010" end="00:52:40.350" style="s2">of find out what is that natural</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.350" end="00:52:42.750" style="s2">inclination within you rather than</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.350" end="00:52:45.960" style="s2">looking at other people and trying to</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.750" end="00:52:49.230" style="s2">repeat a success I was a thing in a way</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.960" end="00:52:52.890" style="s2">that what are you and what do you do for</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.230" end="00:52:54.840" style="s2">fun when no one else watching that could</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.890" end="00:52:56.160" style="s2">most probably get you very much closer</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.840" end="00:52:58.080" style="s2">to that sense of purpose</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.160" end="00:53:00.660" style="s2">the only challenge that we have with</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.080" end="00:53:02.760" style="s2">life is that some things that we like</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.660" end="00:53:06.330" style="s2">doing are paid in some things that we</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.760" end="00:53:08.310" style="s2">that we love doing might not be paid and</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.330" end="00:53:18.420" style="s2">it&#39;s and as that challenge that that</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.310" end="00:53:22.860" style="s2">brings it in sometimes I like that I</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.420" end="00:53:25.650" style="s2">think I&#39;m probably a wide person but I</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.860" end="00:53:29.520" style="s2">wanted to go back to what here I was</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.650" end="00:53:31.200" style="s2">saying about saving the children and how</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.520" end="00:53:34.790" style="s2">there are a lot of people that maybe are</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.200" end="00:53:38.340" style="s2">looking to get that external recognition</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.790" end="00:53:41.040" style="s2">but I think also a lot of people would</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.340" end="00:53:43.770" style="s2">choose something because I think a lot</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.040" end="00:53:48.450" style="s2">of humanity wants to be of service they</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.770" end="00:53:50.220" style="s2">want to find ways to be a support in</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.450" end="00:53:52.590" style="s2">whatever way they can and that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.220" end="00:53:53.970" style="s2">maybe the closest thing to their heart</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.590" end="00:53:56.190" style="s2">so they&#39;re gonna follow whichever</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.970" end="00:53:58.950" style="s2">direction is available and I think</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.190" end="00:54:02.340" style="s2">that&#39;s actually part of our game be is</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.950" end="00:54:04.200" style="s2">really needing to recognize the value in</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.340" end="00:54:07.500" style="s2">people being of service and that</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.200" end="00:54:10.580" style="s2">everybody can be and not that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.500" end="00:54:13.770" style="s2">either just that or you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.580" end="00:54:14.530" style="s2">something else I think that we all have</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.770" end="00:54:16.810" style="s2">a part of</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.530" end="00:54:19.510" style="s2">that want to be of service and sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.810" end="00:54:21.610" style="s2">that&#39;s only we can only find a way is</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.510" end="00:54:23.440" style="s2">through somebody else that&#39;s broken like</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.610" end="00:54:26.770" style="s2">oh then I can show you how I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.440" end="00:54:28.720" style="s2">they necessarily need to get the pat on</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.770" end="00:54:31.030" style="s2">the back but a lot of people I can do</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.720" end="00:54:39.070" style="s2">because our systems are set up that you</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.030" end="00:54:42.640" style="s2">have to get that external reward I do</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.070" end="00:54:47.320" style="s2">think that that reward also reflects on</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.640" end="00:54:49.360" style="s2">your on your personal on your personal</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.320" end="00:54:51.310" style="s2">essence in a way who wants to once you</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.360" end="00:54:53.670" style="s2">talk to you physically if someone goes I</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.310" end="00:54:56.500" style="s2">love you I love you you&#39;re amazing you</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.670" end="00:54:58.210" style="s2">you have a certain sense of longevity</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.500" end="00:55:00.130" style="s2">that comes with it because you you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.210" end="00:55:03.130" style="s2">doing the right thing and you feel</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.130" end="00:55:05.020" style="s2">wanted and needed but I do think it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.130" end="00:55:07.270" style="s2">also comes back to that certain sense of</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.020" end="00:55:09.730" style="s2">being in that center of your purpose and</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.270" end="00:55:13.090" style="s2">if people praise you around that it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.730" end="00:55:25.680" style="s2">just it&#39;s just so much more worth doing</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.090" end="00:55:27.880" style="s2">I know we&#39;re almost out of time but</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.680" end="00:55:31.440" style="s2">something that came up the very</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.880" end="00:55:31.440" style="s2">beginning when Eric was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.920" end="00:55:36.700" style="s2">your purpose I guess when you have heart</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.960" end="00:55:38.950" style="s2">you come into the world with it or are</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.700" end="00:55:40.900" style="s2">you discovering it all the time and</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.950" end="00:55:42.580" style="s2">sometimes you like come across something</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.900" end="00:55:45.850" style="s2">and then later you look back and go oh</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.580" end="00:55:47.470" style="s2">that was meant to be or whatever that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.850" end="00:55:49.740" style="s2">I&#39;m not explaining it very well but I</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.470" end="00:55:53.950" style="s2">didn&#39;t want to say that as an artist</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.740" end="00:55:55.300" style="s2">some of like a lot of times I&#39;m focused</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.950" end="00:55:58.210" style="s2">I have a goal I&#39;m trying to accomplish</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.300" end="00:55:59.950" style="s2">certain things and that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.210" end="00:56:02.890" style="s2">business part of being in the world but</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.950" end="00:56:04.960" style="s2">also I found when I totally let go and</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.890" end="00:56:08.710" style="s2">I&#39;m not like trying to control anything</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.960" end="00:56:11.080" style="s2">and I&#39;m just exploring things come</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.710" end="00:56:13.810" style="s2">through and it&#39;s very surprising and</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.080" end="00:56:15.820" style="s2">then maybe a year two years three years</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.810" end="00:56:18.040" style="s2">down the road I&#39;ll be working on like</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.820" end="00:56:19.510" style="s2">other parts of my purpose my vision that</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.040" end="00:56:21.640" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to share and I&#39;ll realize oh</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.510" end="00:56:23.980" style="s2">my gosh I made all of those things</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.640" end="00:56:27.010" style="s2">explaining exactly this three years</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.980" end="00:56:33.460" style="s2">later so it&#39;s pretty I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.010" end="00:56:34.990" style="s2">and I think we can all understand think</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.460" end="00:56:37.300" style="s2">there&#39;s a know when I first thought</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.990" end="00:56:38.890" style="s2">about it but it wasn&#39;t ready I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.300" end="00:56:40.570" style="s2">ready four years ago like every time it</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.890" end="00:56:45.700" style="s2">comes back around it&#39;s a different level</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.570" end="00:56:47.740" style="s2">and a different flavor yeah I think Jim</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.700" end="00:56:49.960" style="s2">Carrey he did a lot of artwork as well</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.740" end="00:56:52.000" style="s2">and he shared that with his psychologist</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.960" end="00:56:54.760" style="s2">and and there was more answers within</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.000" end="00:56:56.950" style="s2">his art than there was actually how he</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.760" end="00:57:05.110" style="s2">could explain it so and it all came out</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.950" end="00:57:06.160" style="s2">so yeah there&#39;s the simpler up on the</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.110" end="00:57:08.470" style="s2">screen but we only have three minutes</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.160" end="00:57:09.940" style="s2">left he it&#39;s fairly well known Venn</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.470" end="00:57:12.190" style="s2">diagram with four it&#39;s called ACOG II</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.940" end="00:57:15.340" style="s2">think it&#39;s a Japanese word and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.190" end="00:57:17.740" style="s2">where what you love what the world needs</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.340" end="00:57:19.720" style="s2">what you&#39;re good at and what you can be</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.740" end="00:57:21.220" style="s2">paid for all the line and then it gives</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.720" end="00:57:25.120" style="s2">you what you&#39;re missing if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.220" end="00:57:26.410" style="s2">have those four and I&#39;m good I&#39;m good</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.120" end="00:57:28.930" style="s2">with getting rid of one of those one of</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.410" end="00:57:30.400" style="s2">those is completely useless to the world</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.930" end="00:57:30.820" style="s2">which is like that you need to get paid</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.400" end="00:57:34.150" style="s2">for it</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.820" end="00:57:37.450" style="s2">and it&#39;s if you if what you&#39;re missing</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.150" end="00:57:39.880" style="s2">when you can&#39;t pay for it it&#39;s it says</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.450" end="00:57:42.460" style="s2">so when you just can&#39;t be paid for it</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.880" end="00:57:45.250" style="s2">you have excitement you have a delight</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.460" end="00:57:46.660" style="s2">and fullness but not wealth we can</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.250" end="00:57:49.120" style="s2">figure out wealth together like we can</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.660" end="00:57:50.620" style="s2">figure out how we need our food on the</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.120" end="00:57:52.720" style="s2">table a roof over our heads and then</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.620" end="00:57:54.970" style="s2">have everyone doing what they&#39;re good at</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.720" end="00:57:56.380" style="s2">what they love the world needs without</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.970" end="00:57:58.210" style="s2">them needing to get paid for it because</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.380" end="00:57:59.590" style="s2">some of us don&#39;t have one that we can</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.210" end="00:58:01.030" style="s2">get paid for like it&#39;s kind of like the</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.590" end="00:58:04.420" style="s2">one that you just throw in there to make</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.030" end="00:58:07.000" style="s2">the economics work as opposed to to find</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.420" end="00:58:08.710" style="s2">what your purpose is and how you you</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.000" end="00:58:11.230" style="s2">bring it to the world and it is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.710" end="00:58:13.480" style="s2">something where you either solve it</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.230" end="00:58:15.400" style="s2">collectively or as an individual and</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.480" end="00:58:18.430" style="s2">then you have people who can get paid</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.400" end="00:58:19.810" style="s2">for their service running making all the</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.430" end="00:58:21.250" style="s2">rules so the ones getting paid for their</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.810" end="00:58:22.600" style="s2">service whereas those of us who can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.250" end="00:58:25.170" style="s2">necessarily get paid for a service or</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.600" end="00:58:27.730" style="s2">getting paid for it actually undoes it</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.170" end="00:58:29.320" style="s2">that&#39;s like I don&#39;t know why that&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.730" end="00:58:31.030" style="s2">of the for like I&#39;m like I get it I</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.320" end="00:58:33.790" style="s2">understand it at the same time it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.030" end="00:58:35.590" style="s2">one that like we like I&#39;m good with not</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.790" end="00:58:38.440" style="s2">being wealthy and having a deep sense of</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.590" end="00:58:39.630" style="s2">being like the other four are you have a</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.440" end="00:58:47.460" style="s2">sense you</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.630" end="00:58:50.610" style="s2">you see I cannot see money as a</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.460" end="00:58:53.550" style="s2">capacitor so the ability to support you</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.610" end="00:58:55.530" style="s2">let&#39;s say you&#39;re doing what you you like</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.550" end="00:58:56.850" style="s2">doing but you maybe break your leg or</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.530" end="00:59:01.230" style="s2">you just want to take a break or you</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.850" end="00:59:03.240" style="s2">want to so that carries you in a way and</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.230" end="00:59:06.990" style="s2">obviously you need to be able to work</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.240" end="00:59:10.650" style="s2">with money to do that and I think money</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.990" end="00:59:11.730" style="s2">also is a nice added indicator to to</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.650" end="00:59:15.180" style="s2">allow people to do things that they</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.730" end="00:59:18.840" style="s2">don&#39;t like doing so there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.180" end="00:59:20.550" style="s2">work that people hate doing I&#39;ve yet to</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.840" end="00:59:23.190" style="s2">find a single job that there is nobody</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.550" end="00:59:25.170" style="s2">who likes doing he&#39;s my go-to to</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.190" end="00:59:27.080" style="s2">cleaning toilets and first person I told</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.170" end="00:59:32.130" style="s2">that to it wasn&#39;t like I liked it</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.080" end="00:59:33.630" style="s2">alright good I don&#39;t there is a thing I</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.130" end="00:59:34.710" style="s2">do think it&#39;s not a silly imbalance</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.630" end="00:59:36.030" style="s2">there are necessarily enough people who</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.710" end="00:59:39.000" style="s2">like doing the class that work around it</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.030" end="00:59:40.770" style="s2">one but there&#39;s enough people when we</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.000" end="00:59:42.420" style="s2">take away that pristine of society that</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.770" end="00:59:43.560" style="s2">you look up to engineers and down on</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.420" end="00:59:45.960" style="s2">people who clean toilets</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.560" end="00:59:48.660" style="s2">you know like there&#39;s that that&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.960" end="00:59:49.770" style="s2">you actually have a lot of people who we</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.660" end="00:59:52.680" style="s2">do the work like right now would have</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.770" end="00:59:54.600" style="s2">good rotting in the fields not people</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.680" end="00:59:57.060" style="s2">willing to take it down but there are</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.600" end="00:59:59.160" style="s2">people who are willing to take it down</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.060" end="01:00:02.610" style="s2">for free because it&#39;s soon um as a job</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.160" end="01:00:03.630" style="s2">and not volunteer where and I get that</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.610" end="01:00:05.580" style="s2">I&#39;m not gonna go work for a</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.630" end="01:00:06.990" style="s2">multi-million dollar company not get</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.580" end="01:00:09.240" style="s2">paid for it but at the same time it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.990" end="01:00:11.130" style="s2">like that&#39;s the work for those other</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.240" end="01:00:13.080" style="s2">people who don&#39;t get paid well it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.130" end="01:00:15.690" style="s2">they work between if as a high esteem</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.080" end="01:00:17.310" style="s2">and we don&#39;t have the workers and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.690" end="01:00:18.960" style="s2">like so we volunteer and get food or you</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.310" end="01:00:22.550" style="s2">don&#39;t and it&#39;s gonna rot you feel this</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.960" end="01:00:25.230" style="s2">as a bird or outside to you I believe I</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.550" end="01:00:28.230" style="s2">do think that the environment also plays</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.230" end="01:00:30.720" style="s2">into it so if I would only clean to</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.230" end="01:00:32.970" style="s2">elect or work in the field I&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.720" end="01:00:36.780" style="s2">exposed to a lot of Sun which might</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.970" end="01:00:39.390" style="s2">cause cancer or and and that does affect</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.780" end="01:00:42.650" style="s2">me on a on a mental level so I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.390" end="01:00:45.390" style="s2">really participate on a global level as</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.650" end="01:00:46.800" style="s2">others would or some people say up but</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.390" end="01:00:49.170" style="s2">that&#39;s dirty I don&#39;t want to associate</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.800" end="01:00:51.160" style="s2">with that so you still have that thing</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.170" end="01:00:52.480" style="s2">that by coming to play</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.160" end="01:00:54.690" style="s2">which is kind of like V and would be</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.480" end="01:00:57.430" style="s2">good if we could throw that away as long</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.690" end="01:01:01.480" style="s2">with Li with the many elements of that</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.430" end="01:01:03.400" style="s2">as well well the the the the thing is to</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.480" end="01:01:05.170" style="s2">remove and remove the coercive element</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.400" end="01:01:06.280" style="s2">that currently exists right because at</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.170" end="01:01:07.660" style="s2">the moment the person cleaning the</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.280" end="01:01:09.940" style="s2">toilets at the person picking the fruit</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.660" end="01:01:11.740" style="s2">does not have the option to walk away</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.940" end="01:01:13.450" style="s2">from that four bucks an hour or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.740" end="01:01:15.700" style="s2">it is they get paid right if they had</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.450" end="01:01:17.860" style="s2">the option to walk away if they know if</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.700" end="01:01:19.930" style="s2">their lives did not depend on them doing</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.860" end="01:01:21.610" style="s2">this shitty job four bucks an hour and</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.930" end="01:01:23.650" style="s2">they could walk away for it then the</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.610" end="01:01:25.390" style="s2">market would find an actual price at</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.650" end="01:01:27.730" style="s2">which people were willing to do this</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.390" end="01:01:30.250" style="s2">work without being coerced into it in</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.730" end="01:01:31.930" style="s2">any way right and so in picking fruit</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.250" end="01:01:33.400" style="s2">you know it might be twenty or thirty</p>
