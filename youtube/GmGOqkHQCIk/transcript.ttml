<p begin="00:00:02.570" end="00:00:09.320" style="s2">so welcome to voices with reveille key</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.190" end="00:00:12.870" style="s2">I&#39;m joined by my guest are tighter</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.320" end="00:00:15.719" style="s2">Paulette Paulette Paulette thank you</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.870" end="00:00:19.410" style="s2">I&#39;ve just met Tyler recently and I met</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.719" end="00:00:21.180" style="s2">him through a discord server that has</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.410" end="00:00:23.850" style="s2">been set up for people who are</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.180" end="00:00:25.560" style="s2">interested in my work I wanted to talk</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.850" end="00:00:27.420" style="s2">to tout her because he when I when I had</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.560" end="00:00:29.029" style="s2">some conversations with them they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.420" end="00:00:32.149" style="s2">saying some very insightful things about</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.029" end="00:00:34.440" style="s2">you know this whole growing movement</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.149" end="00:00:37.770" style="s2">around these communities that are taking</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.440" end="00:00:41.160" style="s2">shape on this chord servers and networks</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.770" end="00:00:45.059" style="s2">of them and so I think this is very</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.160" end="00:00:46.350" style="s2">important phenomena and first of all if</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.059" end="00:00:48.780" style="s2">we could educate some people on it who</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.350" end="00:00:53.270" style="s2">might not know about it and I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.780" end="00:00:55.980" style="s2">learning about it myself and also to</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.270" end="00:01:00.390" style="s2">again trying explore maybe some of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.980" end="00:01:01.949" style="s2">philosophical implications of this it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.390" end="00:01:03.510" style="s2">not just a new technology it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.949" end="00:01:05.430" style="s2">a new way of relating a new way of</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.510" end="00:01:06.630" style="s2">community building anyways I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.430" end="00:01:09.479" style="s2">too much so Tyler why don&#39;t you say a</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.630" end="00:01:11.729" style="s2">bit about yourself and you know stuck on</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.479" end="00:01:14.490" style="s2">pack you know maybe in an introductory</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.729" end="00:01:16.920" style="s2">manner but you know what what these</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.490" end="00:01:19.799" style="s2">discord servers servers are and what you</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.920" end="00:01:21.119" style="s2">see them doing it cetera yeah yeah no no</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.799" end="00:01:24.060" style="s2">I think it&#39;s a great point there at the</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.119" end="00:01:26.520" style="s2">end I even the fact that what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.060" end="00:01:31.590" style="s2">doing right now this kind of somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.520" end="00:01:32.970" style="s2">long-form capacity to really get into</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.590" end="00:01:35.909" style="s2">the details of what we want to discuss</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.970" end="00:01:38.430" style="s2">and and and to not overly produce the</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.909" end="00:01:41.220" style="s2">content right to dive immediately into</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.430" end="00:01:44.009" style="s2">it kind of expose it and unfold it as as</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.220" end="00:01:46.320" style="s2">we&#39;re doing it in the process you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.009" end="00:01:49.049" style="s2">from like where you are University of</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.320" end="00:01:52.590" style="s2">Toronto Marshall McLuhan writes right</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.049" end="00:01:54.240" style="s2">any message it&#39;s this the the very form</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.590" end="00:01:57.810" style="s2">of what we are doing here I think has an</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.240" end="00:02:01.350" style="s2">impact on it and that all right so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.810" end="00:02:05.430" style="s2">that how I intersecting this</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.350" end="00:02:10.050" style="s2">historically let&#39;s say right I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.430" end="00:02:13.590" style="s2">single father two boys I have I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.050" end="00:02:16.290" style="s2">I&#39;ve become that as the result of</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.590" end="00:02:18.690" style="s2">some of the turbulence that is a part of</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.290" end="00:02:21.120" style="s2">the meaning crisis hmm the dissolution</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.690" end="00:02:24.630" style="s2">of the family as a result of a lack of a</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.120" end="00:02:28.680" style="s2">kind of bedrock that produced a theology</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.630" end="00:02:32.610" style="s2">of the family as a unit off of culture</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.680" end="00:02:34.950" style="s2">as a unit of of being and and also some</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.610" end="00:02:37.590" style="s2">ancillary problems with the way that we</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.950" end="00:02:41.880" style="s2">process all of the difficulties in our</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.590" end="00:02:44.640" style="s2">environment I think okay so personally</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.880" end="00:02:49.110" style="s2">myself I&#39;m I suffer from a series of</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.640" end="00:02:52.950" style="s2">autoimmune diseases and it&#39;s well thank</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.110" end="00:02:55.650" style="s2">you it&#39;s it&#39;s been both a blessing and a</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.950" end="00:02:57.030" style="s2">curse though as I think all things are</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.650" end="00:03:00.750" style="s2">if you if you look at them from the</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.030" end="00:03:04.019" style="s2">right perspective they afford I think a</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.750" end="00:03:09.720" style="s2">kind of chaos from which you can spin up</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.019" end="00:03:13.200" style="s2">something new mm-hmm so um to that end</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.720" end="00:03:15.540" style="s2">I&#39;ve I think been in the mindset of</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.200" end="00:03:18.870" style="s2">trying to uncover what it is that caused</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.540" end="00:03:21.209" style="s2">this in my own life right and and during</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.870" end="00:03:22.739" style="s2">that process I looked into a diet right</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.209" end="00:03:25.410" style="s2">I looked into trying to understand what</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.739" end="00:03:28.069" style="s2">would be the underlying nature the the</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.410" end="00:03:30.690" style="s2">physical causation of my disease I</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.069" end="00:03:32.640" style="s2">looked into some psychology and</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.690" end="00:03:37.950" style="s2">cognitive science understand why it is</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.640" end="00:03:43.069" style="s2">that men and women fight right and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.950" end="00:03:43.069" style="s2">think where I ended up was a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.400" end="00:03:49.470" style="s2">very holistic view that tried to take</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.459" end="00:03:51.600" style="s2">into account all of the ways in which</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.470" end="00:03:53.970" style="s2">these very complicated systems interact</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.600" end="00:03:57.540" style="s2">in particular you know systems like when</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.970" end="00:04:01.049" style="s2">I like my ex-wife and I right and that</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.540" end="00:04:04.380" style="s2">that study led me directly to people</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.049" end="00:04:07.260" style="s2">like Jordan Hall then Jordan green hall</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.380" end="00:04:11.010" style="s2">in fact and I found much of what he said</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.260" end="00:04:12.780" style="s2">in the tech sector quite relevant to my</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.010" end="00:04:13.079" style="s2">own attempts to understand the world at</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.780" end="00:04:15.989" style="s2">the time</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.079" end="00:04:19.440" style="s2">yeah Jordan&#39;s very insightful incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.989" end="00:04:22.979" style="s2">and and very kind as well yeah both he</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.440" end="00:04:24.960" style="s2">and Daniel have been very kind and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.979" end="00:04:26.780" style="s2">Austin Berger who you&#39;re referring to</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.960" end="00:04:30.980" style="s2">correct yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.780" end="00:04:33.050" style="s2">yeah and I think not to jump ahead too</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.980" end="00:04:34.670" style="s2">quickly I suppose but in contact with</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.050" end="00:04:36.470" style="s2">that world in contact with the work</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.670" end="00:04:39.260" style="s2">that&#39;s being done that I was completely</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.470" end="00:04:40.550" style="s2">unaware of people in the world that</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.260" end="00:04:42.230" style="s2">we&#39;re moving about ways and</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.550" end="00:04:44.870" style="s2">understanding in ways that I had never</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.230" end="00:04:47.510" style="s2">even dreamed of you know the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.870" end="00:04:50.420" style="s2">dynamical systems thinking that you can</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.510" end="00:04:51.470" style="s2">begin to analyze and understand the</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.420" end="00:04:54.590" style="s2">motions in the world it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.470" end="00:04:56.810" style="s2">incredibly powerful mm-hmm so yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.590" end="00:04:59.180" style="s2">came across this information I came</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.810" end="00:05:01.610" style="s2">across these thinkers and I&#39;ve reached</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.180" end="00:05:04.669" style="s2">out to them at each case I think and</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.610" end="00:05:06.440" style="s2">I&#39;ve tried to have a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.669" end="00:05:08.960" style="s2">understanding I really here to learn I</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.440" end="00:05:11.419" style="s2">want to to learn how all this functions</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.960" end="00:05:14.810" style="s2">right and try to influence it in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.419" end="00:05:17.690" style="s2">positive manner I think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.810" end="00:05:21.410" style="s2">that&#39;s like my deep Telos at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.690" end="00:05:23.440" style="s2">so yeah that&#39;s my historical thread and</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.410" end="00:05:27.470" style="s2">how I interjected here since that time</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.440" end="00:05:29.300" style="s2">I&#39;ve noticed that so it may be the</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.470" end="00:05:32.960" style="s2">definition of discord it&#39;s a social</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.300" end="00:05:35.140" style="s2">network it&#39;s a application that people</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.960" end="00:05:37.940" style="s2">can gather on and discuss in real time</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.140" end="00:05:39.770" style="s2">both video and audio and share</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.940" end="00:05:43.460" style="s2">multimedia content in the stream form</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.770" end="00:05:46.190" style="s2">kind of like a Facebook reading but the</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.460" end="00:05:49.490" style="s2">possibilities that it&#39;s affording this</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.190" end="00:05:53.750" style="s2">real time Community Development that is</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.490" end="00:05:56.540" style="s2">quite ephemeral in fact where the the</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.750" end="00:05:58.130" style="s2">bonds are not one of locality all right</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.540" end="00:05:59.510" style="s2">they&#39;re not geographically defined</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.130" end="00:06:00.710" style="s2">there&#39;s something more like</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.510" end="00:06:02.120" style="s2">reputationally defined which is</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.710" end="00:06:04.940" style="s2">Harrington&#39;s manner in which you</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.120" end="00:06:05.360" style="s2">communicate so again the medium is the</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.940" end="00:06:07.669" style="s2">message</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.360" end="00:06:11.180" style="s2">role and so what&#39;s what we&#39;re all having</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.669" end="00:06:12.979" style="s2">to learn is how to we&#39;re trying to level</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.180" end="00:06:16.700" style="s2">up our communication capacity so that</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.979" end="00:06:18.800" style="s2">really is right and Socratic ly and in</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.700" end="00:06:20.750" style="s2">dialo goes right learn from each other</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.800" end="00:06:23.690" style="s2">what we really are and what we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.750" end="00:06:25.310" style="s2">searching for so that process is of</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.690" end="00:06:27.770" style="s2">being afforded by these platforms like</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.310" end="00:06:30.830" style="s2">this chord it&#39;s also producing something</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.770" end="00:06:33.350" style="s2">kind of tangential to another already</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.830" end="00:06:35.330" style="s2">like very dominant hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.350" end="00:06:36.890" style="s2">structure which seems to be at the</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.330" end="00:06:39.420" style="s2">present moment failing itself from the</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.890" end="00:06:41.910" style="s2">very particular sets of ways mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.420" end="00:06:45.000" style="s2">and you know we can talk about that too</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.910" end="00:06:46.530" style="s2">but maybe maybe that ain&#39;t was the</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.000" end="00:06:48.090" style="s2">question know that that answered the</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.530" end="00:06:50.160" style="s2">question well I&#39;m not actually intrigued</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.090" end="00:06:52.950" style="s2">about the last thing you said because</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.160" end="00:06:58.710" style="s2">you were implying that you think the</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.950" end="00:07:00.240" style="s2">discord are restructuring they think as</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.710" end="00:07:02.240" style="s2">opposed to a hierarchical structure or</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.240" end="00:07:06.330" style="s2">some alternative kind of structuring of</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.240" end="00:07:08.250" style="s2">society and community building is</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.330" end="00:07:11.250" style="s2">forming and do you think does this mean</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.250" end="00:07:14.130" style="s2">that something like a new culture is</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.250" end="00:07:16.230" style="s2">emerging oh for sure</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.130" end="00:07:18.660" style="s2">okay so you know that new cultures been</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.230" end="00:07:21.540" style="s2">emerging for a long time there are</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.660" end="00:07:23.190" style="s2">always several sets of cultures that are</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.540" end="00:07:25.410" style="s2">integrating themselves kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.190" end="00:07:27.240" style="s2">emotional sets well said yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.410" end="00:07:29.370" style="s2">there they&#39;re you know passing between</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.240" end="00:07:31.800" style="s2">each other there&#39;s at the very least is</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.370" end="00:07:34.170" style="s2">very interesting high level separation</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.800" end="00:07:36.540" style="s2">between child culture and adult culture</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.170" end="00:07:38.160" style="s2">right and like very specific like</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.540" end="00:07:39.870" style="s2">interesting things that only get passed</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.160" end="00:07:41.700" style="s2">and one in the other right like</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.870" end="00:07:44.580" style="s2">hopscotch no adults play hopscotch</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.700" end="00:07:46.470" style="s2">anymore she&#39;s like it&#39;s a perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.580" end="00:07:48.020" style="s2">distinct cultural element it&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.470" end="00:07:49.890" style="s2">transmitted not player</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.020" end="00:07:53.430" style="s2">likewise for something like gaming</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.890" end="00:07:55.680" style="s2">culture which is where discord comes</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.430" end="00:07:59.570" style="s2">from in fact but there&#39;s there&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.680" end="00:08:01.980" style="s2">been a kind of distinct element of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.570" end="00:08:03.870" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like in neoteny right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.980" end="00:08:08.060" style="s2">almost like a continuance of the desire</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.870" end="00:08:12.150" style="s2">to continue playing games in the face of</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.060" end="00:08:14.670" style="s2">what is almost like a just like a</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.150" end="00:08:16.890" style="s2">salient rejection by the current</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.670" end="00:08:19.380" style="s2">structure of the world all right</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.890" end="00:08:23.130" style="s2">so and I think what what that does is it</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.380" end="00:08:25.230" style="s2">it prevents the kind of crystallization</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.130" end="00:08:27.690" style="s2">that usually occurs in the presence of a</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.230" end="00:08:29.970" style="s2">culture that you agree with when I kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.690" end="00:08:31.890" style="s2">of maintain this like childlike sense of</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.970" end="00:08:33.780" style="s2">continually looking and searching it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.890" end="00:08:36.780" style="s2">the you want to open up the search space</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.780" end="00:08:38.190" style="s2">you can support of more wonder and more</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.780" end="00:08:40.620" style="s2">ability to find something that may</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.190" end="00:08:41.700" style="s2">actually work okay so that let&#39;s slow</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.620" end="00:08:44.130" style="s2">down on that because that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.700" end="00:08:47.370" style="s2">cool point I like this the metaphor of</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.130" end="00:08:49.950" style="s2">neoteny kind of cognitive and community</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.370" end="00:08:52.020" style="s2">neoteny that&#39;s really cool because I</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.950" end="00:08:52.779" style="s2">thought of the importance of serious</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.020" end="00:08:54.910" style="s2">play</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.779" end="00:08:57.939" style="s2">um that used to be at work in religion</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.910" end="00:09:01.269" style="s2">for example and and and tried to stay on</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.939" end="00:09:02.470" style="s2">that sort of that staying you know our</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.269" end="00:09:03.819" style="s2">continuity of contact with that</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.470" end="00:09:06.670" style="s2">emergence I think that&#39;s that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.819" end="00:09:08.139" style="s2">powerful what I&#39;m not quite clear on is</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.670" end="00:09:09.490" style="s2">what your juxtaposing it where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.139" end="00:09:11.379" style="s2">contrasting to it you made a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.490" end="00:09:14.290" style="s2">allusions to a crystallize and a</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.379" end="00:09:17.470" style="s2">hierarchical structure so maybe if you</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.290" end="00:09:21.910" style="s2">could nurse in a little bit more that</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.470" end="00:09:25.029" style="s2">would be helpful yeah yeah yeah so so in</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.910" end="00:09:26.769" style="s2">in your in your work like what we what</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.029" end="00:09:28.959" style="s2">we understand about our relations in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.769" end="00:09:31.480" style="s2">world is that in fact the best way to</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.959" end="00:09:34.329" style="s2">look at being and moving in the world is</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.480" end="00:09:36.579" style="s2">something like the inter relationships</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.329" end="00:09:39.999" style="s2">that we have between self and other</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.579" end="00:09:41.860" style="s2">right yeah it or thou or however you</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.999" end="00:09:44.649" style="s2">want to describe it depending on our our</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.860" end="00:09:48.129" style="s2">motive of being or framework right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.649" end="00:09:50.980" style="s2">that inter inter relationship that is</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.129" end="00:09:53.740" style="s2">the define it and kind of science lee</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.980" end="00:09:55.899" style="s2">what this has to represent is some some</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.740" end="00:09:57.699" style="s2">locus in the mind right that referee</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.899" end="00:10:00.519" style="s2">it&#39;s a representation of that attachment</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.699" end="00:10:02.350" style="s2">right and i think that there&#39;s some set</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.519" end="00:10:05.350" style="s2">of sub structures or processes that has</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.350" end="00:10:07.449" style="s2">to instantiate that right this is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.350" end="00:10:08.709" style="s2">very akin to like the the aphorisms that</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.449" end="00:10:10.449" style="s2">we have like you can&#39;t teach an old dog</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.709" end="00:10:16.449" style="s2">new tricks right mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.449" end="00:10:19.059" style="s2">it represents a kind of it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.449" end="00:10:21.040" style="s2">a I think what it represents is just you</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.059" end="00:10:24.430" style="s2">finding your niche in the ecological</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.040" end="00:10:28.269" style="s2">niche right and if you don&#39;t find your</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.430" end="00:10:31.660" style="s2">ecological niche I think it&#39;s I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.269" end="00:10:34.240" style="s2">what happens is you you are you&#39;re stuck</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.660" end="00:10:36.100" style="s2">in a mode of searching right that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.240" end="00:10:37.779" style="s2">we know that there&#39;s a certain kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.100" end="00:10:40.389" style="s2">hormonal change that takes place around</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.779" end="00:10:43.779" style="s2">like age 25 yeah yeah it corresponds</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.389" end="00:10:46.269" style="s2">with like a final maturation of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.779" end="00:10:47.769" style="s2">frontal lobe that represents like a</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.269" end="00:10:49.779" style="s2">higher state of responsibility or</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.769" end="00:10:53.769" style="s2">something right so it&#39;s something like</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.779" end="00:10:56.019" style="s2">that I do think that there is a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.769" end="00:10:59.889" style="s2">a vast expanse of that in our dominant</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.019" end="00:11:02.709" style="s2">culture right that&#39;s expanse of which of</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.889" end="00:11:04.300" style="s2">the crystallization or rejection sorry</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.709" end="00:11:06.670" style="s2">of the rejection of that crystallization</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.300" end="00:11:10.270" style="s2">is this continual mode of wanting</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.670" end="00:11:13.750" style="s2">play right right yeah and that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.270" end="00:11:15.940" style="s2">opposed to a culture I mean I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.750" end="00:11:21.550" style="s2">of the work of Han and others that is</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.940" end="00:11:23.470" style="s2">oriented almost and you know even prom</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.550" end="00:11:26.950" style="s2">you know that our culture is dominantly</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.470" end="00:11:31.750" style="s2">oriented around work and even burn out</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.950" end="00:11:33.520" style="s2">around that right so I&#39;m getting a good</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.750" end="00:11:37.120" style="s2">sense of this now so this court is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.520" end="00:11:40.270" style="s2">place in which people are doing this</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.120" end="00:11:42.400" style="s2">serious play but it has a deep</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.270" end="00:11:44.110" style="s2">developmental import is interesting at</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.400" end="00:11:45.940" style="s2">the exact Stein would like this so it</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.110" end="00:11:47.950" style="s2">has a deep developmental import and is</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.940" end="00:11:50.020" style="s2">kind of because they are the illusion</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.950" end="00:11:52.240" style="s2">you&#39;re making reference to of courses in</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.020" end="00:11:53.680" style="s2">biological evolution neoteny what you</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.240" end="00:11:57.220" style="s2">can see is one way in which species</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.680" end="00:11:58.480" style="s2">emerge right is so you have like chimps</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.220" end="00:12:00.280" style="s2">and then if you take that chimp and</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.480" end="00:12:02.050" style="s2">they&#39;re an its childhood gets extended</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.280" end="00:12:04.210" style="s2">much much longer you actually get</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.050" end="00:12:05.740" style="s2">something more like a human being that</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.210" end="00:12:07.150" style="s2">was an overly crude and overly</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.740" end="00:12:09.820" style="s2">simplistic but just to get the basic</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.150" end="00:12:11.560" style="s2">idea so this ability to adaptively</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.820" end="00:12:15.550" style="s2">because there&#39;s lots of maladaptive ways</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.560" end="00:12:17.110" style="s2">of for stalling adults with about put it</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.550" end="00:12:23.140" style="s2">that way there&#39;s lots of maladaptive</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.110" end="00:12:25.990" style="s2">ways but sometimes when so the Antony is</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.140" end="00:12:29.020" style="s2">the term for when we extend childhood in</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.990" end="00:12:30.970" style="s2">the period of serious play such that it</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.020" end="00:12:34.210" style="s2">comes adaptive and one of the ideas</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.970" end="00:12:36.580" style="s2">behind this is our extended childhood</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.210" end="00:12:38.680" style="s2">allowed us to internalize much more</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.580" end="00:12:40.900" style="s2">complex culture and that of course</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.680" end="00:12:42.910" style="s2">affords human existence sorry I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.900" end="00:12:44.980" style="s2">trying to unpack packed a lot into that</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.910" end="00:12:46.990" style="s2">metaphor but did I treat your idea</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.980" end="00:12:49.870" style="s2">fairly first of all no I think it&#39;s well</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.990" end="00:12:52.840" style="s2">said yeah okay so then the idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.870" end="00:12:55.570" style="s2">we might have a cultural cognitive and</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.840" end="00:12:58.390" style="s2">cyber sort of constellation that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.570" end="00:13:01.690" style="s2">creating an adaptive kind of neoteny for</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.390" end="00:13:07.660" style="s2">us in which serious play is being</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.690" end="00:13:10.570" style="s2">prolonged so that we can perhaps ramp up</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.660" end="00:13:14.050" style="s2">the complexity of the enculturation</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.570" end="00:13:16.000" style="s2">process the kind of you know software</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.050" end="00:13:18.370" style="s2">that we have to it allow me that</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.000" end="00:13:20.499" style="s2">metaphor that we have to internalize in</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.370" end="00:13:22.959" style="s2">order to deal with an increasingly comp</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.499" end="00:13:23.799" style="s2">world is that is that am i getting what</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.959" end="00:13:25.479" style="s2">you&#39;re what you&#39;re saying yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.799" end="00:13:27.639" style="s2">absolutely and more than that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.479" end="00:13:29.499" style="s2">allowing I think as you&#39;re discovering a</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.639" end="00:13:31.749" style="s2">potential place where you have you can</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.499" end="00:13:33.759" style="s2">act as a note of resonance right yes or</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.749" end="00:13:36.819" style="s2">since making is failing in general</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.759" end="00:13:38.589" style="s2">because of the kind of well just some of</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.819" end="00:13:41.529" style="s2">the systemic failures of the broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.589" end="00:13:44.139" style="s2">nature of the medium it&#39;s much better</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.529" end="00:13:45.879" style="s2">represented by this capacity to directly</p>

<p begin="00:14:54.249" end="00:14:58.029" style="s2">and the finding from that subsequently a</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.109" end="00:15:03.209" style="s2">kind of nihilism right yeah very much</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.029" end="00:15:05.319" style="s2">and that&#39;s that that&#39;s certainly the</p>

<p begin="00:15:10.720" end="00:15:15.579" style="s2">undercurrent of that right i think it</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.749" end="00:15:17.199" style="s2">represents a liminal layer like there</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.579" end="00:15:18.429" style="s2">there&#39;s definitely some transitional</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.199" end="00:15:21.849" style="s2">element to this that we&#39;re moving</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.429" end="00:15:26.519" style="s2">towards a kind of sense making apparatus</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.849" end="00:15:28.659" style="s2">that we can rely upon and in direct</p>

<p begin="00:15:28.659" end="00:15:33.790" style="s2">this technological layer i mean i i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.679" end="00:15:35.830" style="s2">noted the fact to go</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.790" end="00:15:37.780" style="s2">back to McLuhan I&#39;ve noted the fact I</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.830" end="00:15:39.160" style="s2">think I can&#39;t remember which one of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.780" end="00:15:41.140" style="s2">Weinsteins introduced this idea but I</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.160" end="00:15:43.480" style="s2">sort of picked it up and ran with it a</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.140" end="00:15:45.430" style="s2">little bit independently you know that</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.480" end="00:15:47.050" style="s2">the digital campfire that this medium is</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.430" end="00:15:49.000" style="s2">really weird because it breaks a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.050" end="00:15:50.950" style="s2">the standard sort of social grammar I</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.000" end="00:15:53.350" style="s2">mean your face is very large for me</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.950" end="00:15:54.670" style="s2">right now and it was it no no no no no</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.350" end="00:15:58.750" style="s2">don&#39;t I&#39;m not telling you to move back</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.670" end="00:16:00.370" style="s2">that&#39;s the point the point is that if I</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.750" end="00:16:02.830" style="s2">imagine mine is for you to or for the</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.370" end="00:16:04.390" style="s2">viewers and normally this would if we</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.830" end="00:16:06.310" style="s2">were actually physically present this</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.390" end="00:16:08.140" style="s2">would convey all kinds of social meaning</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.310" end="00:16:09.910" style="s2">about status and their right and it</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.140" end="00:16:11.770" style="s2">would carry all this weird you know I</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.910" end="00:16:13.660" style="s2">just met you this is inappropriate</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.770" end="00:16:15.220" style="s2">intimacy and all that kind of crap right</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.660" end="00:16:18.040" style="s2">what the thing about but the thing about</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.220" end="00:16:19.900" style="s2">this medium is all of that it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.040" end="00:16:22.870" style="s2">sort of no it&#39;s thrown away it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.900" end="00:16:26.380" style="s2">developing its own grammar fright of how</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.870" end="00:16:29.440" style="s2">people are and I was thinking that it</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.380" end="00:16:31.750" style="s2">reminded me of you know the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.440" end="00:16:32.920" style="s2">mattress on oh that you know we spend a</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.750" end="00:16:35.110" style="s2">lot of time through several species</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.920" end="00:16:36.490" style="s2">around campfires and this is like I</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.110" end="00:16:38.770" style="s2">can&#39;t fire experience and that people</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.490" end="00:16:40.690" style="s2">are lit because they&#39;re electronically</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.770" end="00:16:42.850" style="s2">there they&#39;re very intimate we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.690" end="00:16:44.260" style="s2">actually spatially located and it&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.850" end="00:16:48.040" style="s2">of approximates like what you have in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.260" end="00:16:50.560" style="s2">circle all right and and so it goes back</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.040" end="00:16:52.660" style="s2">to something very primordial but it so</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.560" end="00:16:55.300" style="s2">it&#39;s tapping in some established</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.660" end="00:16:57.460" style="s2">machinery I think but it&#39;s also using it</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.300" end="00:16:59.620" style="s2">in this really novel way because like</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.460" end="00:17:05.140" style="s2">you said and what&#39;s really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.620" end="00:17:07.060" style="s2">for me is how this how this how it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.140" end="00:17:08.230" style="s2">you know symbol on to connect two things</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.060" end="00:17:10.360" style="s2">together that previously weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.230" end="00:17:13.440" style="s2">connected together you know the way this</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.360" end="00:17:16.440" style="s2">cuts across you know in the dialogues</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.440" end="00:17:19.360" style="s2">Socrates is very critical of writing</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.440" end="00:17:21.400" style="s2">because you know it&#39;s permanent and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.360" end="00:17:22.930" style="s2">the person&#39;s that out there and you</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.400" end="00:17:25.060" style="s2">can&#39;t talk to them and he wants to do</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.930" end="00:17:27.220" style="s2">everything in person but of course the</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.060" end="00:17:30.160" style="s2">problem with that is it&#39;s very you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.220" end="00:17:32.440" style="s2">it&#39;s very impermanent and so that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.160" end="00:17:34.420" style="s2">so Plato is ironically writing the</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.440" end="00:17:35.890" style="s2">dialogues down and there&#39;s the irony is</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.420" end="00:17:37.480" style="s2">intended you&#39;re supposed to pay</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.890" end="00:17:40.090" style="s2">attention to that but I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.480" end="00:17:42.370" style="s2">notice how that divide has been</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.090" end="00:17:45.040" style="s2">transcended I mean this is this is one</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.370" end="00:17:47.700" style="s2">on one you&#39;re talking multiple people</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.040" end="00:17:49.500" style="s2">but it&#39;s also it&#39;s also recorded</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.700" end="00:17:51.210" style="s2">and otherwise and then listen and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.500" end="00:17:53.309" style="s2">these conversations have sort of a meta</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.210" end="00:17:54.870" style="s2">conversation going on between them with</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.309" end="00:17:56.700" style="s2">people moving between these</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.870" end="00:17:58.740" style="s2">conversations and kind of a meta</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.700" end="00:18:01.559" style="s2">conversation which is like it&#39;s beyond</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.740" end="00:18:03.600" style="s2">that divide it joins them together and</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.559" end="00:18:06.090" style="s2">it afford something really new and how</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.600" end="00:18:09.480" style="s2">we can interact with each other right</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.090" end="00:18:11.070" style="s2">right and it&#39;s a it&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.480" end="00:18:13.380" style="s2">interesting playground because it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.070" end="00:18:16.710" style="s2">i think representing both kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.380" end="00:18:19.440" style="s2">postmodern tendencies with a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.710" end="00:18:21.779" style="s2">trial-by-fire try try anything and and</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.440" end="00:18:23.130" style="s2">everything goes and also a more meta</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.779" end="00:18:24.990" style="s2">modern approach where people are</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.130" end="00:18:26.909" style="s2">searching for the connective tissue</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.990" end="00:18:28.950" style="s2">right that&#39;s kind of gathering and</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.909" end="00:18:31.500" style="s2">making more sense of the whole process</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.950" end="00:18:37.500" style="s2">and what you&#39;re describing there is is</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.500" end="00:18:40.260" style="s2">very well said that&#39;s I I think just to</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.500" end="00:18:43.710" style="s2">to speak emotionally from briefly being</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.260" end="00:18:46.110" style="s2">embedded within it sure it&#39;s been quite</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.710" end="00:18:48.450" style="s2">it&#39;s been quite wonderful to watch the</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.110" end="00:18:50.970" style="s2">direct impact it&#39;s had on individual</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.450" end="00:18:53.399" style="s2">lives the the meaning that they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.970" end="00:18:56.639" style="s2">personally been able to make huh yeah at</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.399" end="00:19:01.980" style="s2">the bonfire yeah it&#39;s an it&#39;s funny that</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.639" end="00:19:03.809" style="s2">you you say that and it&#39;s we we have</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.980" end="00:19:05.519" style="s2">several channels across several dis</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.809" end="00:19:06.570" style="s2">cords that are actually titled bonfire</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.519" end="00:19:09.090" style="s2">oh really</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.570" end="00:19:11.669" style="s2">in the late night we can sit and play</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.090" end="00:19:15.500" style="s2">music and talk with one another and</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.669" end="00:19:20.070" style="s2">speak concerning the issues of our soul</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.500" end="00:19:22.289" style="s2">and with this with this both top down</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.070" end="00:19:24.389" style="s2">and bottom approach where you have you</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.289" end="00:19:26.580" style="s2">have wonderful people who have done such</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.389" end="00:19:28.769" style="s2">good work like yourself put it into the</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.580" end="00:19:31.110" style="s2">medium right and it&#39;s filtered down</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.769" end="00:19:32.429" style="s2">through the technology into the mines</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.110" end="00:19:34.139" style="s2">and the mouths of the people that are</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.429" end="00:19:36.059" style="s2">trying to make sense of it and then we</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.139" end="00:19:38.639" style="s2">gather in small groups and speak about</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.059" end="00:19:42.630" style="s2">this is wonderful and and people have</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.639" end="00:19:44.669" style="s2">have at each moment recovered gems right</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.630" end="00:19:47.130" style="s2">they they&#39;ve found little moments where</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.669" end="00:19:48.840" style="s2">they haha that&#39;s what they&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.130" end="00:19:51.720" style="s2">this is what it is and what I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.840" end="00:19:54.029" style="s2">doing my life now to your to your meta</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.720" end="00:19:57.090" style="s2">modern point to this this meta</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.029" end="00:19:58.710" style="s2">extractable point yeah there are people</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.090" end="00:20:00.480" style="s2">working on tools right now people that</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.710" end="00:20:00.870" style="s2">I&#39;ve come into contact with where they</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.480" end="00:20:02.700" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.870" end="00:20:05.850" style="s2">the content of this dialogue right here</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.700" end="00:20:07.410" style="s2">right where maybe 13 minutes in one</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.850" end="00:20:10.410" style="s2">person out of a hundred had an aha</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.410" end="00:20:12.690" style="s2">moment right and if you can take the</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.410" end="00:20:14.880" style="s2">transcript and somehow find a way to</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.690" end="00:20:17.520" style="s2">extract that piece of an aha moment and</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.880" end="00:20:20.430" style="s2">save it and transmit it in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.520" end="00:20:22.020" style="s2">it&#39;s recoverable across time oh there</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.430" end="00:20:24.090" style="s2">are ways to do this and people are</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.020" end="00:20:25.920" style="s2">working on solving this problem and I</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.090" end="00:20:27.630" style="s2">think that it&#39;s a it&#39;s a fascinating way</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.920" end="00:20:31.110" style="s2">to level up the capacity that we each</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.630" end="00:20:32.730" style="s2">have for finding insight yeah yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.110" end="00:20:35.160" style="s2">mean that&#39;s a defining feature of dia</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.730" end="00:20:37.080" style="s2">logos right as opposed to combative</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.160" end="00:20:40.559" style="s2">adversarial where the point is to defeat</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.080" end="00:20:43.500" style="s2">and gain victory the point of dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.559" end="00:20:45.120" style="s2">is if you and I right can both get to</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.500" end="00:20:47.700" style="s2">places that we couldn&#39;t get to on our</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.120" end="00:20:49.830" style="s2">own right that that&#39;s that that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.700" end="00:20:51.809" style="s2">that&#39;s the really central feature if we</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.830" end="00:20:53.040" style="s2">both said Wow because about I got</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.809" end="00:20:55.860" style="s2">somewhere I couldn&#39;t have gone on my own</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.040" end="00:20:57.720" style="s2">die and you say it to it and wait wait</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.860" end="00:20:59.700" style="s2">wait and we don&#39;t even have to have the</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.720" end="00:21:02.700" style="s2">same insight it just could be that</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.700" end="00:21:04.559" style="s2">within that conversation we both come to</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.700" end="00:21:07.710" style="s2">have those kinds of insights I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.559" end="00:21:09.929" style="s2">that&#39;s the life breath of Delos maybe</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.710" end="00:21:12.600" style="s2">it&#39;s akin to the reciprocal opening but</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.929" end="00:21:14.100" style="s2">yeah when you experience even if you</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.600" end="00:21:15.929" style="s2">don&#39;t experience the insight directly</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.100" end="00:21:18.030" style="s2">but when you experience another person</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.929" end="00:21:20.280" style="s2">experiencing insight there is a magnetic</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.030" end="00:21:22.740" style="s2">transfer this immediately yep yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.280" end="00:21:27.030" style="s2">invoking that desire in yourself and and</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.740" end="00:21:29.070" style="s2">then you become searching for it you say</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.030" end="00:21:31.559" style="s2">Leah means yeah yeah yeah that&#39;s well</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.070" end="00:21:34.290" style="s2">said that&#39;s well said that&#39;s really well</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.559" end="00:21:35.700" style="s2">said so I really I want to go back is</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.290" end="00:21:37.650" style="s2">that really it really sparked me when</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.700" end="00:21:39.480" style="s2">you were and your gestures were quite</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.650" end="00:21:41.940" style="s2">dramatic in the good sense of the word</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.480" end="00:21:44.429" style="s2">dramatic you know the top down and</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.940" end="00:21:46.679" style="s2">bottom up because I&#39;ve been I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.429" end="00:21:51.150" style="s2">saying about how important that is if</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.679" end="00:21:52.679" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna actually make any any sort</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.150" end="00:21:56.820" style="s2">of cultural change that&#39;s needed to</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.679" end="00:22:01.920" style="s2">address the meaning crisis so what is it</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.820" end="00:22:04.100" style="s2">like what is your role in that like in</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.920" end="00:22:06.570" style="s2">that sort of top-down bottom-up</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.100" end="00:22:08.160" style="s2">convergence what are you doing like how</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.570" end="00:22:10.140" style="s2">are you participating I mean because I</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.160" end="00:22:12.720" style="s2">met you like you were making the rules</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.140" end="00:22:14.429" style="s2">actually some way sure sure - no that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.720" end="00:22:14.700" style="s2">perfect it&#39;s actually captured somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.429" end="00:22:16.560" style="s2">in my</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.700" end="00:22:19.740" style="s2">they can see the screen name there but</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.560" end="00:22:21.720" style="s2">it&#39;s the blister crack um the the the</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.740" end="00:22:23.400" style="s2">cognitive structures that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.720" end="00:22:25.350" style="s2">engender are related to the languages</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.400" end="00:22:26.850" style="s2">that we use right right it&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.350" end="00:22:29.670" style="s2">weakened Stein Ian perhaps but that</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.850" end="00:22:31.770" style="s2">divides I think it&#39;s deeply true that we</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.670" end="00:22:35.280" style="s2">when we develop these similar cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.770" end="00:22:36.720" style="s2">languages use this kind of structures</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.280" end="00:22:40.830" style="s2">that we don&#39;t have to fight over all the</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.720" end="00:22:41.910" style="s2">time that we all it makes life more</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.830" end="00:22:44.070" style="s2">meaningful and we can enter the flow</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.910" end="00:22:46.050" style="s2">state more readily right right and and</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.070" end="00:22:48.330" style="s2">so what we&#39;re doing is at the top down</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.050" end="00:22:50.220" style="s2">bottom approach is where we&#39;re taking</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.330" end="00:22:53.130" style="s2">elements of two different perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.220" end="00:22:54.630" style="s2">and then at that middle ground there has</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.130" end="00:22:56.750" style="s2">to be an exchange of the languages that</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.630" end="00:22:59.540" style="s2">develop between those two places and</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.750" end="00:23:05.070" style="s2">historically if you take a look at the</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.540" end="00:23:07.800" style="s2">the the Hegelian ahead of us yeah looks</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.070" end="00:23:10.140" style="s2">like say civilization and the collapse</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.800" end="00:23:12.360" style="s2">of it right like those those cultural</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.140" end="00:23:15.990" style="s2">elements which are conducive to</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.360" end="00:23:17.700" style="s2">corruption and destruction I think a lot</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.990" end="00:23:19.530" style="s2">of it has to do with the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.700" end="00:23:22.590" style="s2">separation the cultural separation</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.530" end="00:23:25.230" style="s2">tendencies where language groups kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.590" end="00:23:26.580" style="s2">cluster around certain experiences so</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.230" end="00:23:29.030" style="s2">you know in our modern times this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.580" end="00:23:33.000" style="s2">more readily felt between something like</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.030" end="00:23:35.010" style="s2">rural and urban living right male and</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.000" end="00:23:36.600" style="s2">female living right but these language</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.010" end="00:23:38.010" style="s2">groups and language clusters become ways</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.600" end="00:23:40.710" style="s2">in which we battle with each other</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.010" end="00:23:42.780" style="s2">I think the lingua Franca&#39;s space though</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.710" end="00:23:44.460" style="s2">right the the middle ground where we</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.780" end="00:23:46.230" style="s2">communicate the differences between</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.460" end="00:23:47.970" style="s2">those is really dramatically important</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.230" end="00:23:50.850" style="s2">it&#39;s a kind of cultural element that</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.970" end="00:23:52.860" style="s2">hasn&#39;t been paid attention to it so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.850" end="00:23:54.600" style="s2">a little shamanic perhaps yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.860" end="00:23:56.190" style="s2">it&#39;s a little bit translational where</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.600" end="00:23:57.840" style="s2">you take in all the cultural elements</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.190" end="00:24:00.420" style="s2">and you&#39;re trying to find a way in which</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.840" end="00:24:02.580" style="s2">they are Concilium right and so</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.420" end="00:24:05.880" style="s2">plebiscito cred is that is the merger of</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.580" end="00:24:08.130" style="s2">the plebeian and the aristocratic right</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.880" end="00:24:10.920" style="s2">it&#39;s larger world isn&#39;t it to bring them</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.130" end="00:24:13.140" style="s2">together so that&#39;s the role I think so</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.920" end="00:24:15.240" style="s2">in addition to the serious play there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.140" end="00:24:16.500" style="s2">poesis going on there because I mean</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.240" end="00:24:18.270" style="s2">what you what you&#39;re saying is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.500" end="00:24:20.850" style="s2">trying to create a mediating language</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.270" end="00:24:22.830" style="s2">that&#39;s like symbol on its gonna join</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.850" end="00:24:24.480" style="s2">things together forms of discourse that</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.830" end="00:24:25.890" style="s2">previously haven&#39;t been talking to each</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.480" end="00:24:27.660" style="s2">other very much I do something analogous</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.890" end="00:24:28.350" style="s2">in cognitive science trying to create a</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.660" end="00:24:30.210" style="s2">bridging</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.350" end="00:24:33.500" style="s2">language yes right the various</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.210" end="00:24:35.400" style="s2">disciplines synoptic integration so so</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.500" end="00:24:37.169" style="s2">I&#39;m just trying to put these two</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.400" end="00:24:38.250" style="s2">metaphors together because they feel</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.169" end="00:24:39.750" style="s2">like they&#39;re very close to each other</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.250" end="00:24:41.490" style="s2">and now I hope you be able to help me on</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.750" end="00:24:45.750" style="s2">it we&#39;ve got one we&#39;ve got this metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.490" end="00:24:47.400" style="s2">of the bottom-up top-down and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.750" end="00:24:49.590" style="s2">there&#39;s the mediating realm and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.400" end="00:24:51.450" style="s2">with I take it that what you&#39;re alluding</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.590" end="00:24:53.610" style="s2">to is in that mediating realm was what</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.450" end="00:24:56.340" style="s2">is what&#39;s also happening is this</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.610" end="00:24:58.110" style="s2">integration between different languages</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.340" end="00:25:00.150" style="s2">so it&#39;s acting as something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.110" end="00:25:02.850" style="s2">binding things together sort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.150" end="00:25:04.500" style="s2">counteracting that centrifugal tendency</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.850" end="00:25:06.360" style="s2">you were mentioning that tends to like</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.500" end="00:25:09.929" style="s2">really put a stress on civilizations</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.360" end="00:25:11.900" style="s2">yeah put those together yeah yeah it may</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.929" end="00:25:15.120" style="s2">even be akin to something like how the</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.900" end="00:25:17.280" style="s2">the radical enlargement of the middle</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.120" end="00:25:19.380" style="s2">class prevented the ultimate outcome</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.280" end="00:25:21.270" style="s2">that Marx predicted right right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.380" end="00:25:25.830" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a nice a socio-economic</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.270" end="00:25:28.770" style="s2">metaphor so what like what what do you</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.830" end="00:25:31.950" style="s2">what are you doing I&#39;m I can hear people</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.770" end="00:25:33.740" style="s2">who are who are no experienced as you</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.950" end="00:25:37.140" style="s2">know I&#39;m novice to this I just got on</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.740" end="00:25:40.890" style="s2">thanks to the help of Brett and meeting</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.140" end="00:25:42.000" style="s2">you and your help so concretely like</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.890" end="00:25:45.720" style="s2">specifically I know that you&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.000" end="00:25:47.970" style="s2">several of these and like what is what</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.720" end="00:25:49.380" style="s2">do you do like give it a quick like what</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.970" end="00:25:51.179" style="s2">would you do if you&#39;re on there like</p>

<p begin="00:25:51.179" end="00:25:55.409" style="s2">these are very powerful and I and and</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.309" end="00:25:57.600" style="s2">important ideas that we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.409" end="00:25:59.120" style="s2">here but I&#39;m asking you how do you how</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.600" end="00:26:01.380" style="s2">do you concretize them into specific</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.120" end="00:26:03.990" style="s2">actions practices like what is it you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.380" end="00:26:06.360" style="s2">doing well a lot of it is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.990" end="00:26:09.720" style="s2">conversational approach right a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.360" end="00:26:11.760" style="s2">it is directing people to a more</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.720" end="00:26:13.770" style="s2">balanced approach to conversation right</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.760" end="00:26:17.760" style="s2">right right yeah being the middle ground</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.770" end="00:26:20.520" style="s2">is is the receiving and you know both</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.760" end="00:26:23.690" style="s2">the positive and the negative it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.520" end="00:26:27.360" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s quite an interesting clash</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.690" end="00:26:30.120" style="s2">you can see certain clusters of cultural</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.360" end="00:26:31.530" style="s2">elements like it previously described as</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.120" end="00:26:32.850" style="s2">left brain and right brain things like</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.530" end="00:26:34.679" style="s2">that when they come together in</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.850" end="00:26:37.110" style="s2">conversation is quite interesting right</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.679" end="00:26:38.970" style="s2">right and there&#39;s a really strange</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.110" end="00:26:41.549" style="s2">mediating role that has to be played by</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.970" end="00:26:42.119" style="s2">a language that it has to be it has to</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.549" end="00:26:44.399" style="s2">make it</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.119" end="00:26:46.379" style="s2">Aaron that the way that both groups are</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.399" end="00:26:49.829" style="s2">seeing the world are similar and useful</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.379" end="00:26:51.269" style="s2">right and there&#39;s a there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.829" end="00:26:53.489" style="s2">representative element of that across</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.269" end="00:26:54.959" style="s2">all sorts of language groups mm-hmm I</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.489" end="00:26:56.099" style="s2">think the development of a language</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.959" end="00:26:58.829" style="s2">represents you know some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.099" end="00:27:00.389" style="s2">cultural niche which is yeah yes you</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.829" end="00:27:01.829" style="s2">know affording something some value and</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.389" end="00:27:03.269" style="s2">it&#39;s true that you can recover that</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.829" end="00:27:06.299" style="s2">value so through some translational</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.269" end="00:27:09.419" style="s2">process and yeah that so the I I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.299" end="00:27:12.989" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s like parts moderation</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.419" end="00:27:15.299" style="s2">parts encouragement it&#39;s it&#39;s a hobby</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.989" end="00:27:20.489" style="s2">for me I&#39;m not getting paid to do it</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.299" end="00:27:23.869" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah it&#39;s just a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.489" end="00:27:27.019" style="s2">fascinating and really like I say a</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.869" end="00:27:31.589" style="s2">wonderful thing to behold when people</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.019" end="00:27:34.769" style="s2">dive into what is true and what is deep</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.589" end="00:27:37.289" style="s2">and then recover a better way of seeing</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.769" end="00:27:40.169" style="s2">the world it&#39;s I think a reward in and</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.289" end="00:27:42.509" style="s2">of itself but I hope what it does is it</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.169" end="00:27:45.269" style="s2">begins to allow people who represent</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.509" end="00:27:47.729" style="s2">what should be the future of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.269" end="00:27:49.739" style="s2">developing world a way to converse so</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.729" end="00:27:51.419" style="s2">they can figure out how to do it right</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.739" end="00:27:54.569" style="s2">right that that same thing is happening</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.419" end="00:27:57.479" style="s2">in think tanks all over the place right</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.569" end="00:27:58.919" style="s2">and a very regimented and highly ordered</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.479" end="00:28:01.409" style="s2">away but I think there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.919" end="00:28:04.229" style="s2">extraordinary element of talent and</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.409" end="00:28:06.559" style="s2">skill and time it&#39;s being lost and in</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.229" end="00:28:10.169" style="s2">our in our current cultural space and</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.559" end="00:28:12.419" style="s2">this place represents a huge pool of</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.169" end="00:28:15.569" style="s2">talent a huge pool of interest I could</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.419" end="00:28:17.099" style="s2">name two dozen names of fascinatingly</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.569" end="00:28:19.679" style="s2">strange and interesting people that are</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.099" end="00:28:21.209" style="s2">working on really cool things and they</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.679" end="00:28:23.879" style="s2">could probably never hold a traditional</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.209" end="00:28:26.339" style="s2">job and I mean I could I could go for</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.879" end="00:28:28.109" style="s2">another hour or two at least on all the</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.339" end="00:28:29.519" style="s2">really strange and interesting ways that</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.109" end="00:28:32.279" style="s2">a platform like this court and others</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.519" end="00:28:35.189" style="s2">could be spun up to to make ephemeral</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.279" end="00:28:39.239" style="s2">ways of dealing with the world in terms</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.189" end="00:28:41.339" style="s2">of new corporations and new ways of</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.239" end="00:28:43.259" style="s2">viewing capitalism and all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.339" end="00:28:45.449" style="s2">fascinating little you know experiments</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.259" end="00:28:49.559" style="s2">that could be produced in this cultural</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.449" end="00:28:52.349" style="s2">space but in and of itself the this</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.559" end="00:28:54.479" style="s2">represents a potential new educational</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.349" end="00:28:55.280" style="s2">medium yeah it could represent I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.479" end="00:29:00.050" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.280" end="00:29:02.630" style="s2">a very self-sustaining way a new</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.050" end="00:29:05.480" style="s2">educational platform right where people</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.630" end="00:29:07.580" style="s2">extract true education right yeah like</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.480" end="00:29:09.800" style="s2">what what you&#39;re able to do here now</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.580" end="00:29:13.430" style="s2">that the questioning and the answering</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.800" end="00:29:16.820" style="s2">and this direct translation right there</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.430" end="00:29:18.890" style="s2">is no inter exchange it&#39;s affording some</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.820" end="00:29:21.430" style="s2">turbulence we get it directly yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.890" end="00:29:23.480" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s new that&#39;s and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.430" end="00:29:25.910" style="s2">that&#39;s something I think that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.480" end="00:29:28.070" style="s2">encourage and grow and these things are</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.910" end="00:29:30.050" style="s2">quite large I know I may not pop by on</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.070" end="00:29:33.080" style="s2">my my friend Paul vertically he has one</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.050" end="00:29:34.370" style="s2">and I was in fest like we just started</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.080" end="00:29:36.320" style="s2">one on was like two hundred and</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.370" end="00:29:38.330" style="s2">something people on it and like or the</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.320" end="00:29:39.980" style="s2">first day I imagine on some of the other</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.330" end="00:29:41.450" style="s2">ones you&#39;re on like there&#39;s thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.980" end="00:29:44.060" style="s2">people involved and things like that</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.450" end="00:29:45.920" style="s2">right Eric Weinstein and Lex Friedman I</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.060" end="00:29:48.200" style="s2">think are both over ten thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.920" end="00:29:49.610" style="s2">now right of course and it&#39;s their it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.200" end="00:29:51.890" style="s2">their presence than when they come in</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.610" end="00:29:54.260" style="s2">and and they it affords everyone direct</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.890" end="00:29:56.720" style="s2">close contact with a leading thinker in</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.260" end="00:29:58.400" style="s2">an industry right and again this this</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.720" end="00:30:00.530" style="s2">capacity to make sense of the world to</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.400" end="00:30:02.450" style="s2">ask questions deep questions penetrating</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.530" end="00:30:05.260" style="s2">questions need to do that on a human</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.450" end="00:30:07.820" style="s2">level it&#39;s truly something else I mean</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.260" end="00:30:11.150" style="s2">well I I mean I just I&#39;ve done it the</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.820" end="00:30:12.440" style="s2">first time right right and and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.150" end="00:30:14.270" style="s2">questions were good and it was so</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.440" end="00:30:17.060" style="s2">exciting and I was getting into the flow</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.270" end="00:30:20.540" style="s2">state or just participating in it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.060" end="00:30:21.890" style="s2">it was very very powerful um so I mean</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.540" end="00:30:23.780" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting because it&#39;s both</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.890" end="00:30:25.070" style="s2">quantitatively and qualitatively very</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.780" end="00:30:27.050" style="s2">powerful I mean any of your reading</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.070" end="00:30:29.390" style="s2">right thousand tens or thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.050" end="00:30:31.910" style="s2">people and but each person is getting</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.390" end="00:30:33.710" style="s2">you know you know potential access to</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.910" end="00:30:36.050" style="s2">very high quality level of discussion</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.710" end="00:30:38.150" style="s2">and interaction it&#39;s very very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.050" end="00:30:39.920" style="s2">and we&#39;re working on ways to try to make</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.150" end="00:30:42.170" style="s2">it more efficient right as you can</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.920" end="00:30:43.700" style="s2">imagine like clustering reaction groups</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.170" end="00:30:45.950" style="s2">into ways where people can monitor</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.700" end="00:30:48.020" style="s2">reactions of you kind of sift the best</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.950" end="00:30:49.580" style="s2">signal to the top there are lots of</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.020" end="00:30:52.460" style="s2">really interesting ways that you can</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.580" end="00:30:54.230" style="s2">integrate yourself with the the</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.460" end="00:30:56.660" style="s2">distributed and select of the crowd</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.230" end="00:30:58.340" style="s2">right and it&#39;s starting to develop its</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.660" end="00:31:00.350" style="s2">nascent right you can see the edges of</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.340" end="00:31:03.830" style="s2">it it&#39;s really fascinating the way that</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.350" end="00:31:05.060" style="s2">people are reacting and I really think</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.830" end="00:31:07.880" style="s2">there&#39;s a girl a lot of potential here</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.060" end="00:31:08.380" style="s2">for for the early stages of what</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.880" end="00:31:12.190" style="s2">everyone</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.380" end="00:31:13.900" style="s2">keeps looking for this this dis this</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.190" end="00:31:17.260" style="s2">description of how technology is</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.900" end="00:31:19.540" style="s2">interwoven with the the collective</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.260" end="00:31:21.700" style="s2">intelligence right is self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.540" end="00:31:24.190" style="s2">collective intelligence oh and what that</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.700" end="00:31:26.560" style="s2">is demonstrating is is happening here on</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.190" end="00:31:30.210" style="s2">a place like discord so this holds out</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.560" end="00:31:32.800" style="s2">something for me this time it&#39;s very it</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.210" end="00:31:36.300" style="s2">interested in very concerned about which</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.800" end="00:31:38.770" style="s2">is trying to do something analogous with</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.300" end="00:31:41.340" style="s2">analogous to individual cognition with</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.770" end="00:31:45.030" style="s2">distributed cognition which is you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.340" end="00:31:47.530" style="s2">to transform intelligence into</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.030" end="00:31:52.660" style="s2">rationality which is a different thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.530" end="00:31:55.120" style="s2">right sorry there&#39;s a very loud jet</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.660" end="00:31:58.570" style="s2">passing by that&#39;s okay can&#39;t really hear</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.120" end="00:32:00.250" style="s2">as much on my end so you know you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.570" end="00:32:01.810" style="s2">intelligence is this various you said</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.250" end="00:32:04.510" style="s2">there&#39;s self-organizing sense making</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.810" end="00:32:06.760" style="s2">thing but it&#39;s also capable of a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.510" end="00:32:10.690" style="s2">self-deception and a lot of you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.760" end="00:32:13.360" style="s2">Dilla Tereus patterns yeah yeah yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.690" end="00:32:15.550" style="s2">so what I&#39;m interested in is again sort</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.360" end="00:32:17.020" style="s2">of the emerge it you know one of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.550" end="00:32:18.580" style="s2">virtual engines that are emerging what</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.020" end="00:32:20.710" style="s2">are the sets of constraints that are</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.580" end="00:32:22.000" style="s2">coming into play so that we get this</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.710" end="00:32:23.320" style="s2">process to be more than just</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.000" end="00:32:26.350" style="s2">self-organizing that it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.320" end="00:32:31.270" style="s2">self-correcting and it becomes capable</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.350" end="00:32:33.520" style="s2">right of you know noting and patterns</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.270" end="00:32:35.620" style="s2">that are deceptive self-deceptive in</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.520" end="00:32:37.480" style="s2">some way and things like that you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.620" end="00:32:38.860" style="s2">some of the key elements are internal</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.480" end="00:32:40.480" style="s2">structures so if you define everything</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.860" end="00:32:42.220" style="s2">in terms of like boundary conditions</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.480" end="00:32:44.110" style="s2">right I it&#39;s it quite clear that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.220" end="00:32:45.700" style="s2">an inside and outside there&#39;s a set of</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.110" end="00:32:46.960" style="s2">rules that governs that which happens on</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.700" end="00:32:48.790" style="s2">the inside and then there&#39;s a manner in</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.960" end="00:32:51.040" style="s2">which you kind of translate resources in</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.790" end="00:32:54.100" style="s2">risen outwards as you take in food and</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.040" end="00:32:55.540" style="s2">you excrete waste out of it right in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.100" end="00:32:58.710" style="s2">marketplace dynamics it&#39;s something like</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.540" end="00:33:01.450" style="s2">the production of a product or waste but</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.710" end="00:33:03.400" style="s2">yeah so what we&#39;re lacking here is is a</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.450" end="00:33:04.510" style="s2">number of different things I think one</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.400" end="00:33:05.860" style="s2">we&#39;re lacking a clear incentive</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.510" end="00:33:07.570" style="s2">structure it&#39;s hard for people to</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.860" end="00:33:09.100" style="s2">understand precisely what to work on and</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.570" end="00:33:10.930" style="s2">how to govern themselves towards it so</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.100" end="00:33:12.310" style="s2">the teleological elements missing a</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.930" end="00:33:15.100" style="s2">little bit and part of that is because</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.310" end="00:33:17.080" style="s2">of some one of the lack of integration</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.100" end="00:33:19.090" style="s2">of the top-down approach right where the</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.080" end="00:33:21.460" style="s2">nodes at expertise are acting as a way</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.090" end="00:33:22.150" style="s2">to guide the kind of distributed</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.460" end="00:33:23.680" style="s2">cognition that</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.150" end="00:33:27.490" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have a clear structure that</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.680" end="00:33:30.360" style="s2">represents that expertise right yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.490" end="00:33:32.380" style="s2">the other thing is is that systemic</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.360" end="00:33:34.660" style="s2">internal structure which allows you to</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.380" end="00:33:37.090" style="s2">convey those resources in an efficient</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.660" end="00:33:39.790" style="s2">manner now that&#39;s starting to develop</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.090" end="00:33:43.030" style="s2">it&#39;s also in a nascent form we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.790" end="00:33:45.640" style="s2">working on projects that are tangential</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.030" end="00:33:46.930" style="s2">to a cryptographic element something</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.640" end="00:33:49.060" style="s2">that&#39;s in that space called a</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.930" end="00:33:52.020" style="s2">decentralized autonomous organizations</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.060" end="00:33:55.750" style="s2">right and the way that these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.020" end="00:33:57.790" style="s2">inform systems of voting and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.750" end="00:34:00.430" style="s2">know exactly based on early testing how</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.790" end="00:34:02.320" style="s2">functional that will be but it&#39;s at</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.430" end="00:34:04.150" style="s2">least early foray into something that</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.320" end="00:34:06.580" style="s2">will look like the way in which people</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.150" end="00:34:09.340" style="s2">can kind of collectively organized their</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.580" end="00:34:11.470" style="s2">sense making on the technical aspect</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.340" end="00:34:12.940" style="s2">right on the infrastructure itself and</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.470" end="00:34:18.190" style="s2">so that that may be starting to develop</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.940" end="00:34:21.190" style="s2">too and I think third why&#39;s there there</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.190" end="00:34:23.020" style="s2">is as yet a failure of ways to integrate</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.190" end="00:34:24.790" style="s2">it with the actual marketplace of value</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.020" end="00:34:27.610" style="s2">right right right right now there is</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.790" end="00:34:30.490" style="s2">there&#39;s as yet an unknown way to take</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.610" end="00:34:35.500" style="s2">that product which is made by this right</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.490" end="00:34:37.149" style="s2">so what what is afforded by this in</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.500" end="00:34:39.220" style="s2">other words all right let&#39;s say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.149" end="00:34:40.929" style="s2">recorded whatever the recording gets</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.220" end="00:34:43.419" style="s2">demolished what you and I appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.929" end="00:34:46.270" style="s2">from this now can no longer be</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.419" end="00:34:47.950" style="s2">transmitted right but it exists the</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.270" end="00:34:52.350" style="s2">value still exists it just can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.950" end="00:34:55.140" style="s2">multiplied right right and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.350" end="00:34:57.640" style="s2">that&#39;s what we&#39;re trying to do if we can</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.140" end="00:35:01.330" style="s2">because I think like you said that</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.640" end="00:35:03.340" style="s2">self-deceptive element it represents a</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.330" end="00:35:04.870" style="s2">friction right it represents the</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.340" end="00:35:07.120" style="s2">turbulent elements of it attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.870" end="00:35:08.470" style="s2">reach the flow State right right all</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.120" end="00:35:11.680" style="s2">those distractive elements that you have</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.470" end="00:35:14.890" style="s2">to keep sifting through before you find</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.680" end="00:35:18.160" style="s2">the real thing and the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.890" end="00:35:20.740" style="s2">distribute moments of insight moments of</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.160" end="00:35:22.170" style="s2">value to true moments of value I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.740" end="00:35:27.000" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.170" end="00:35:30.060" style="s2">is is to counter the presence of that</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.000" end="00:35:31.680" style="s2">distant and disorganized thought and</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.060" end="00:35:33.600" style="s2">kind of diseased elements that</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.680" end="00:35:34.770" style="s2">pathological thinking that we see in our</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.600" end="00:35:38.370" style="s2">cultural landscape</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.770" end="00:35:40.650" style="s2">you need them more rapidly both convert</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.370" end="00:35:45.450" style="s2">and diverging elements of thinking right</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.650" end="00:35:47.370" style="s2">it needs both yeah I&#39;m really impressed</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.450" end="00:35:50.040" style="s2">by that that there&#39;s a there&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.370" end="00:35:51.120" style="s2">well you&#39;re at least exemplifying it</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.040" end="00:35:53.460" style="s2">there&#39;s already a degree of</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.120" end="00:35:58.070" style="s2">self-reflection about how to bring in</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.460" end="00:36:01.020" style="s2">you know ways in which the this whole</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.070" end="00:36:05.580" style="s2">dynamical system can self correct and</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.020" end="00:36:07.260" style="s2">improve and you know it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.580" end="00:36:09.090" style="s2">something like a spire I was gonna say</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.260" end="00:36:15.080" style="s2">it can grow now you know it can write</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.090" end="00:36:17.760" style="s2">you can it can afford</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.080" end="00:36:19.500" style="s2">well like I I think it&#39;s fair to say I</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.760" end="00:36:21.960" style="s2">will seem you like you&#39;re trying to move</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.500" end="00:36:23.370" style="s2">it towards collective rationality and</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.960" end="00:36:27.570" style="s2">perhaps even collective wisdom and</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.370" end="00:36:29.370" style="s2">because oh yes yeah I mean go ahead and</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.570" end="00:36:32.760" style="s2">that that moving towards is more like a</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.370" end="00:36:35.130" style="s2">calling to ah that&#39;s what I want that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.760" end="00:36:37.080" style="s2">what I was looking for that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.130" end="00:36:38.850" style="s2">there was something I wanted and you put</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.080" end="00:36:40.650" style="s2">your finger on it right there there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.850" end="00:36:42.210" style="s2">that you know that comes up encircling</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.650" end="00:36:43.770" style="s2">yeah you know some of the conversations</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.210" end="00:36:45.660" style="s2">I&#39;ve had with guys sensed on its sense</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.770" end="00:36:47.370" style="s2">of harkening the sense of the logos</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.660" end="00:36:49.320" style="s2">that&#39;s emerging and that&#39;s calling you</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.370" end="00:36:51.240" style="s2">and you&#39;re trying to be true to the</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.320" end="00:36:53.520" style="s2">logos just different you know the sense</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.240" end="00:36:56.280" style="s2">of you know maintaining that continuity</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.520" end="00:36:58.460" style="s2">of faithfulness of contact to this thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.280" end="00:37:00.810" style="s2">as its taking shape yes very very much</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.460" end="00:37:02.340" style="s2">and it&#39;s a fascinating process and</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.810" end="00:37:04.170" style="s2">difficult to describes difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.340" end="00:37:05.760" style="s2">articulate yeah yeah yeah that&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.170" end="00:37:07.740" style="s2">know that inability to name at the</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.760" end="00:37:10.370" style="s2">inability to put your finger on it for</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.740" end="00:37:14.490" style="s2">the two graphs grasp it is what&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.370" end="00:37:15.990" style="s2">think your attempt to grasp is what&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.490" end="00:37:18.630" style="s2">fascinating about it right the way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.990" end="00:37:21.260" style="s2">just yeah it moves out of the way right</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.630" end="00:37:23.490" style="s2">and and but it&#39;s so fascinating because</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.260" end="00:37:24.810" style="s2">you&#39;ve noticed where you&#39;ve been right</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.490" end="00:37:26.760" style="s2">you&#39;ve noticed where your arm went in</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.810" end="00:37:28.890" style="s2">your tent to swipe it yeah that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.760" end="00:37:32.859" style="s2">self right and then you reflect on that</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.890" end="00:37:35.840" style="s2">moment like oh my gosh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.859" end="00:37:37.910" style="s2">yeah it so it&#39;s very much it&#39;s very much</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.840" end="00:37:39.170" style="s2">like when you&#39;re doing Tai Chi Chuan and</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.910" end="00:37:41.960" style="s2">you&#39;re sparring with somebody and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.170" end="00:37:43.130" style="s2">trying to do that you know in Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.960" end="00:37:44.960" style="s2">Hall and I&#39;ve been talking about this</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.130" end="00:37:48.020" style="s2">and we&#39;re trying to bring back these</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.960" end="00:37:49.760" style="s2">notions of you know of an older notion</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.020" end="00:37:50.869" style="s2">of faith or at least a new notion of</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.760" end="00:37:52.280" style="s2">faith I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s old or new I</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.869" end="00:37:53.900" style="s2">can&#39;t tell anymore</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.280" end="00:37:56.060" style="s2">but that we you find in the Socratic</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.900" end="00:37:59.210" style="s2">dialogue you know our Socrates was very</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.060" end="00:38:02.090" style="s2">you know adept at following the argument</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.210" end="00:38:05.680" style="s2">no matter where it went and keeping his</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.090" end="00:38:07.700" style="s2">interlocutors engaged and there was this</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.680" end="00:38:09.710" style="s2">friend like you say trying to say with</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.700" end="00:38:11.690" style="s2">that is it a reasoning skill well not</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.710" end="00:38:13.520" style="s2">just reasoning and it&#39;s not just logic</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.690" end="00:38:15.770" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s this thing that hangs between</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.520" end="00:38:17.390" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of you know it&#39;s got elements</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.770" end="00:38:19.670" style="s2">of reason in it elements of poetry</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.390" end="00:38:23.630" style="s2">elements of myth it&#39;s like it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.670" end="00:38:25.700" style="s2">amazing kind of thing and and and then</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.630" end="00:38:27.320" style="s2">there&#39;s that&#39;s on the sort of the person</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.700" end="00:38:29.030" style="s2">side and then there&#39;s this like you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.320" end="00:38:30.770" style="s2">Christopher master pH when I talk about</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.030" end="00:38:32.780" style="s2">like the guy&#39;s the third factor the</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.770" end="00:38:34.760" style="s2">logos that emerges and you&#39;re crying</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.780" end="00:38:36.619" style="s2">like you don&#39;t and you know what what</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.760" end="00:38:39.950" style="s2">exactly that is is also something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.619" end="00:38:42.140" style="s2">constantly it&#39;s alright on the end two</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.950" end="00:38:43.790" style="s2">people are doing that right yeah then</p>

<p begin="00:38:49.970" end="00:38:53.950" style="s2">think when when one of the some of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.609" end="00:38:56.450" style="s2">great philosophers would describe</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.950" end="00:38:59.450" style="s2">philosophy ax yeah a way of life right</p>

<p begin="00:39:08.090" end="00:39:12.410" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about to something your</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.250" end="00:39:14.810" style="s2">instantiating and participating with</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.410" end="00:39:16.820" style="s2">them and your exemplifying a way of life</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.810" end="00:39:19.820" style="s2">and your beautifying it your making it</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.820" end="00:39:21.859" style="s2">attractive to to other people that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.820" end="00:39:26.270" style="s2">yeah and that yeah and that&#39;s all bound</p>

<p begin="00:39:26.270" end="00:39:30.619" style="s2">me to the question I mean it I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.060" end="00:39:33.800" style="s2">that&#39;s and it&#39;s happening on a place</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.619" end="00:39:38.390" style="s2">called discord yes right I love the</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.800" end="00:39:41.240" style="s2">irony of it kind of reversal right well</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.390" end="00:39:44.450" style="s2">I I found the irony so as so Socratic</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.240" end="00:39:46.099" style="s2">you know those Socrates looks like he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.450" end="00:39:48.349" style="s2">always creating discord because he come</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.099" end="00:39:50.690" style="s2">in challenges and crates aporia but</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.349" end="00:39:55.849" style="s2">people get drawn along nevertheless in</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.690" end="00:40:01.599" style="s2">this very powerful way so I as I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.849" end="00:40:03.529" style="s2">to say um this sounds so resonant with</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.599" end="00:40:06.140" style="s2">convergent with I&#39;m not quite sure what</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.529" end="00:40:07.640" style="s2">the metaphorical verb is here with this</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.140" end="00:40:09.700" style="s2">project that I&#39;ve been wrestling with</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.640" end="00:40:13.549" style="s2">about the religion that&#39;s not a religion</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.700" end="00:40:18.229" style="s2">and making it simultaneously scalable</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.549" end="00:40:20.059" style="s2">and rigorous having a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.229" end="00:40:21.769" style="s2">functionality that religions had for</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.059" end="00:40:26.329" style="s2">transforming consciousness cognition</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.769" end="00:40:29.690" style="s2">community culture but also not being a</p>

<p begin="00:40:29.690" end="00:40:32.690" style="s2">mythology in fact it&#39;s a different world</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.670" end="00:40:34.940" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about here we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.690" end="00:40:36.619" style="s2">about this weird symbol on between the</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.940" end="00:40:38.539" style="s2">interpersonal world and the cyber world</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.619" end="00:40:41.119" style="s2">it&#39;s a different world it doesn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.539" end="00:40:43.430" style="s2">doesn&#39;t fit in the axial world the axial</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.119" end="00:40:45.769" style="s2">age mythology I feel like what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.430" end="00:40:46.849" style="s2">talking about here and the way I think</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.769" end="00:40:48.680" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna connect up with these</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.849" end="00:40:50.539" style="s2">emerging communities of practices like</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.680" end="00:40:53.059" style="s2">what Rafe Kelley is doing and people</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.539" end="00:40:54.680" style="s2">like that I think I mean it feels to me</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.059" end="00:40:56.539" style="s2">like this is deeply convergent with what</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.680" end="00:40:58.640" style="s2">I&#39;ve been talking about in the religion</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.539" end="00:41:00.349" style="s2">that&#39;s not a religion I mean you&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.640" end="00:41:02.630" style="s2">to forgive me of course I&#39;m biased I I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.349" end="00:41:06.559" style="s2">gonna be looking for any signs that will</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.630" end="00:41:09.859" style="s2">confirm my hypothesis but what do you</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.559" end="00:41:13.430" style="s2">thought in in in the to use another</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.859" end="00:41:15.769" style="s2">metaphor in in the top-down bottom-up</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.430" end="00:41:17.269" style="s2">approach there&#39;s a reason that we</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.769" end="00:41:19.489" style="s2">reached out to you right there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.269" end="00:41:22.150" style="s2">reason that these two worlds made</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.489" end="00:41:25.519" style="s2">contact right there was these</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.150" end="00:41:27.380" style="s2">supercharged elements of the the you</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.519" end="00:41:29.299" style="s2">know the electric cloud right and then</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.380" end="00:41:30.589" style="s2">the positive emotions underneath and</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.299" end="00:41:33.710" style="s2">these little tendrils that send out</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.589" end="00:41:35.390" style="s2">modes of contact right and if there is</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.710" end="00:41:37.339" style="s2">something valuable here right if we</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.390" end="00:41:40.670" style="s2">demonstrate if we truly demonstrate it a</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.339" end="00:41:43.190" style="s2">spark of such power and heat and</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.670" end="00:41:45.229" style="s2">transformative City and plasma and</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.190" end="00:41:48.410" style="s2">energy what we&#39;ll demonstrate itself</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.229" end="00:41:49.880" style="s2">such as as we&#39;ve seen over and over</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.410" end="00:41:52.670" style="s2">again like that one small moment you</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.880" end="00:41:54.650" style="s2">came in and and you demonstrated not to</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.670" end="00:41:56.150" style="s2">be too congratulatory for yourself I</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.650" end="00:41:58.609" style="s2">think an element of what you talked</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.150" end="00:42:00.079" style="s2">about there that that ability to to move</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.609" end="00:42:02.989" style="s2">in towards in a way for</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.079" end="00:42:04.339" style="s2">and to deal with some of the the the</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.989" end="00:42:05.869" style="s2">people that spoke with you there that</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.339" end="00:42:08.150" style="s2">evening that not necessarily had</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.869" end="00:42:10.789" style="s2">something that was on topic but but you</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.150" end="00:42:13.160" style="s2">spoke penetratingly you searchingly like</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.789" end="00:42:14.869" style="s2">willing to go into their space and and</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.160" end="00:42:16.190" style="s2">to question it right to interrogate it</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.869" end="00:42:18.229" style="s2">and i really appreciated that and i was</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.190" end="00:42:21.529" style="s2">able to see it happen and that</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.229" end="00:42:23.690" style="s2">reflective moment made an impact on me</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.529" end="00:42:25.279" style="s2">and now i will try to do more of that in</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.690" end="00:42:27.529" style="s2">my own being right so that that was a</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.279" end="00:42:29.029" style="s2">that was a wonderful affordance that</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.529" end="00:42:31.489" style="s2">that happened in that moment right and</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.029" end="00:42:33.410" style="s2">and you can think that maybe five ten</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.489" end="00:42:35.299" style="s2">percent maybe more had that same</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.410" end="00:42:36.799" style="s2">experience and to think of the way</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.299" end="00:42:39.589" style="s2">though it ripples out and the way that</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.799" end="00:42:41.539" style="s2">cultural elements kind of memetic lee</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.589" end="00:42:46.819" style="s2">transferred it&#39;s something that we need</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.539" end="00:42:49.519" style="s2">to recover that we&#39;ve lost in the and so</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.819" end="00:42:50.900" style="s2">i wanted to say the diaspora of our</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.519" end="00:42:54.229" style="s2">meaning but i&#39;m not sure what that would</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.900" end="00:42:56.299" style="s2">mean it&#39;s been such a fracturing of</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.229" end="00:42:57.589" style="s2">things that have just splintered off and</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.299" end="00:42:59.869" style="s2">we have to bring them back in and</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.589" end="00:43:01.759" style="s2">recover them yeah there&#39;s there&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.869" end="00:43:04.130" style="s2">to do that and i think it&#39;s starting to</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.759" end="00:43:06.499" style="s2">show up there&#39;s a way to recover what it</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.130" end="00:43:08.119" style="s2">is to be human and to really find out</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.499" end="00:43:12.699" style="s2">what it is to be more than human perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.119" end="00:43:15.339" style="s2">right what was meant by that and i think</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.699" end="00:43:17.959" style="s2">it&#39;s really wonderful time to be alive</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.339" end="00:43:21.140" style="s2">well first of all thank you for what you</p>

<p begin="00:43:28.329" end="00:43:32.900" style="s2">that i might have moved towards</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.440" end="00:43:34.069" style="s2">achieving that is very encouraging to me</p>

<p begin="00:43:57.380" end="00:44:03.319" style="s2">a nimbleness and acuity of mind and</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.949" end="00:44:06.529" style="s2">expression that i think is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.319" end="00:44:07.699" style="s2">needed i think you you you you need to</p>

<p begin="00:44:10.249" end="00:44:12.829" style="s2">is why i wanted to do this i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.140" end="00:44:13.530" style="s2">very valuable</p>

<p begin="00:44:35.060" end="00:44:38.910" style="s2">honestly there are an extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.380" end="00:44:41.880" style="s2">number of people just like me in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.910" end="00:44:45.000" style="s2">background I and I know you don&#39;t seek</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.880" end="00:44:51.840" style="s2">we don&#39;t seek the foreground so much as</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.000" end="00:44:55.590" style="s2">we seek to to strengthen the background</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.840" end="00:44:57.150" style="s2">right right there&#39;s a middle ground that</p>

<p begin="00:45:43.710" end="00:45:46.980" style="s2">knowledge transmission relationship but</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.480" end="00:45:52.710" style="s2">the potential for some degree of</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.980" end="00:45:55.320" style="s2">mentorship right and so yeah yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.710" end="00:45:58.920" style="s2">very important for me is a vocation it&#39;s</p>
