<p begin="00:05:35.009" end="00:05:39.789" style="s2">and I wanted to grab onto it I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.499" end="00:05:42.430" style="s2">appreciate it I didn&#39;t want to take it</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.789" end="00:05:43.779" style="s2">for granted I have a phrase that I often</p>

<p begin="00:06:26.949" end="00:06:31.059" style="s2">of the major major things that I learned</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.599" end="00:06:34.629" style="s2">as I went on is that was what was so</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.059" end="00:06:37.749" style="s2">important was that my life reflect my</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.629" end="00:06:39.490" style="s2">values my temperament my interests that</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.749" end="00:06:41.639" style="s2">I could only build a happy life on the</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.490" end="00:06:44.289" style="s2">foundation of my own nature</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.639" end="00:06:46.839" style="s2">Gretchen realized that if she was going</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.289" end="00:06:50.019" style="s2">to tackle a project of this size she</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.839" end="00:06:52.029" style="s2">needed a plan so she created a chart the</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.019" end="00:06:52.719" style="s2">chart was divided into the twelve months</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.029" end="00:06:55.599" style="s2">of the year</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.719" end="00:06:57.990" style="s2">each month had a theme for example the</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.599" end="00:07:01.779" style="s2">theme for January was boost energy</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.990" end="00:07:04.930" style="s2">February remember love March aim higher</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.779" end="00:07:07.719" style="s2">and so on and for each month she made a</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.930" end="00:07:10.119" style="s2">list of daily resolutions so under</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.719" end="00:07:12.569" style="s2">June&#39;s theme of make time for friendship</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.119" end="00:07:16.330" style="s2">her resolutions were remember birthdays</p>

<p begin="00:07:16.330" end="00:07:21.639" style="s2">friends every night Gretchen would put a</p>

<p begin="00:07:21.639" end="00:07:25.869" style="s2">that she had managed to keep it that day</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.759" end="00:07:28.180" style="s2">having a chart helped Gretchen to</p>

<p begin="00:07:43.810" end="00:07:46.120" style="s2">I have never failed to find fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.399" end="00:07:47.500" style="s2">but I was</p>

<p begin="00:07:47.500" end="00:07:51.940" style="s2">know just like every time you go to buy</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.150" end="00:07:53.680" style="s2">clothes you buy the same black sweater</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.940" end="00:07:55.449" style="s2">that you always bought before I just</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.680" end="00:07:58.600" style="s2">felt like my thoughts were stuck in a</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.449" end="00:08:00.910" style="s2">groove I felt that I was backsliding in</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.600" end="00:08:02.290" style="s2">all the usual ways and one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.910" end="00:08:03.850" style="s2">is when you think a lot about how you</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.290" end="00:08:06.790" style="s2">want to be better it makes you much more</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.850" end="00:08:08.680" style="s2">aware of what you&#39;re doing wrong so for</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.790" end="00:08:10.630" style="s2">example I didn&#39;t think I gossip very</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.680" end="00:08:12.550" style="s2">much but when I decided that I was going</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.630" end="00:08:14.919" style="s2">to stop altogether I realized how often</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.550" end="00:08:16.270" style="s2">I did so I was much more aware of all</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.919" end="00:08:17.710" style="s2">the things that I was doing that I knew</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.270" end="00:08:21.430" style="s2">were contrary to my happiness but I was</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.710" end="00:08:22.690" style="s2">doing anyway and one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.430" end="00:08:25.660" style="s2">came from my happiness project is I just</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.690" end="00:08:27.430" style="s2">have this long bag of things that I do</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.660" end="00:08:30.940" style="s2">to try to get through it so it&#39;s things</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.430" end="00:08:33.099" style="s2">like go to bed early call a friend go</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.940" end="00:08:36.219" style="s2">outside in the sunlight get some</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.099" end="00:08:38.589" style="s2">exercise do a good deed for someone else</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.219" end="00:08:41.380" style="s2">one of the best ways to self-medicate I</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.589" end="00:08:44.229" style="s2">did all these things and eventually I</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.380" end="00:08:45.910" style="s2">came out of it but I think it&#39;s natural</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.229" end="00:08:49.210" style="s2">to just go through these periods where</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.910" end="00:08:50.529" style="s2">you just feel blue and that wasn&#39;t in</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.210" end="00:08:52.029" style="s2">for any particular reason but then of</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.529" end="00:08:53.920" style="s2">course naturally we all have periods for</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.029" end="00:08:55.600" style="s2">a very specific reason we&#39;re feeling</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.920" end="00:08:56.910" style="s2">very unhappy so I think one of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.600" end="00:08:59.200" style="s2">things about a Happiness Project is</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.910" end="00:09:01.029" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s not possible to be happy</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.200" end="00:09:02.920" style="s2">it&#39;s just not realistic you&#39;re just not</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.029" end="00:09:06.040" style="s2">in a happy time of life it&#39;s not you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.920" end="00:09:07.510" style="s2">not happy but I think what I learned was</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.040" end="00:09:09.550" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s things that you can do</p>

<p begin="00:31:21.529" end="00:31:25.760" style="s2">that&#39;s not what faith means at all what</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.419" end="00:31:28.519" style="s2">faith means is the willingness to put</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.760" end="00:31:30.590" style="s2">yourself on the line in pursuit of those</p>

<p begin="00:31:33.940" end="00:31:50.149" style="s2">emphasized above all the role that faith</p>

<p begin="00:32:00.919" end="00:32:06.080" style="s2">surprising because as soon as you start</p>

<p begin="00:32:09.289" end="00:32:13.309" style="s2">appropriate is immediately religious and</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.299" end="00:32:15.620" style="s2">the reason for that is that religion is</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.309" end="00:32:17.480" style="s2">precisely that element of human</p>

<p begin="00:32:42.409" end="00:32:48.350" style="s2">will die and so that makes existence</p>

<p begin="00:32:48.350" end="00:32:53.570" style="s2">existentially impossible but the</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.320" end="00:32:55.539" style="s2">religious impulse combats that in a</p>

<p begin="00:32:55.539" end="00:33:00.190" style="s2">opens up to the human being the</p>

<p begin="00:47:06.060" end="00:47:13.020" style="s2">is following whatever it is in your life</p>

<p begin="00:47:38.250" end="00:47:43.560" style="s2">and virtue requires what requires</p>

<p begin="00:50:44.390" end="00:50:50.640" style="s2">unfinished or broken and that the role</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.270" end="00:50:54.119" style="s2">of the human being is to complete it to</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.640" end="00:50:57.720" style="s2">perfect it to finish it and see the idea</p>

<p begin="00:50:57.720" end="00:51:02.099" style="s2">and hence it&#39;s tragic and incomplete</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.210" end="00:51:04.799" style="s2">manner and that the role of the human</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.099" end="00:51:09.329" style="s2">being is in some sense to participate in</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.799" end="00:51:12.470" style="s2">its perfection is a concept that is so</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.329" end="00:51:15.539" style="s2">profound that it makes happiness as a</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.470" end="00:51:17.940" style="s2">concept designed to encapsulate the</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.539" end="00:51:22.190" style="s2">meaning of life so shallow that it</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.940" end="00:51:22.190" style="s2">instantly becomes virtually negligible</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.160" end="00:51:32.069" style="s2">we have a hypothesis here that the</p>

<p begin="00:51:42.779" end="00:51:48.539" style="s2">unbeatable I think because what it does</p>
