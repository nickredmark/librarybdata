<p begin="00:01:15.450" end="00:01:21.659" style="s2">discussion of the the different periods</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.570" end="00:01:23.790" style="s2">of time for the Roman Empire and how the</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.659" end="00:01:24.990" style="s2">plantations were either large or small</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.790" end="00:01:27.479" style="s2">and the type of land management</p>

<p begin="00:01:31.670" end="00:01:38.130" style="s2">similarly when we look at areas like the</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.250" end="00:01:41.040" style="s2">Nile River in northeastern Africa</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.130" end="00:01:43.350" style="s2">especially in Egypt where there&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.040" end="00:01:45.299" style="s2">civilization for eight thousand ten</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.350" end="00:01:48.450" style="s2">thousand years and they&#39;ve been living</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.299" end="00:01:50.610" style="s2">sustainably in that River Delta for all</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.450" end="00:01:54.149" style="s2">of that time then what will happen when</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.610" end="00:01:58.560" style="s2">we put in a large industrial scale 20th</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.149" end="00:02:01.829" style="s2">century Dam as we did in the 1970s and</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.560" end="00:02:05.130" style="s2">then we go from a period of 8,000 years</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.829" end="00:02:07.320" style="s2">of abundant food production to within 20</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.130" end="00:02:09.840" style="s2">years widespread poverty and</p>

<p begin="00:02:17.100" end="00:02:22.590" style="s2">the Nile River so when we look at these</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.440" end="00:02:24.990" style="s2">large-scale patterns of how human</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.590" end="00:02:27.690" style="s2">communities use in the land and manage</p>

<p begin="00:02:31.260" end="00:02:36.630" style="s2">become possible and this book also goes</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.080" end="00:02:38.250" style="s2">into so you can see on the picture here</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.630" end="00:02:40.050" style="s2">this is the Dust Bowl in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.250" end="00:02:40.890" style="s2">southwestern United States in the early</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.050" end="00:02:45.480" style="s2">20th century</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.890" end="00:02:47.910" style="s2">it also looks at the the rise of slavery</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.480" end="00:02:50.760" style="s2">and its relationship to plantations in</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.910" end="00:02:53.040" style="s2">the southern United States in its early</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.760" end="00:02:55.500" style="s2">history so one thing that I didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.040" end="00:02:57.990" style="s2">until I read this book was that the</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.500" end="00:03:00.240" style="s2">economics of slavery only made sense</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.990" end="00:03:03.480" style="s2">when the farmers were mostly growing</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.240" end="00:03:05.970" style="s2">tobacco crops which are a high market</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.480" end="00:03:08.310" style="s2">value yield in a small amount of land</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.970" end="00:03:10.590" style="s2">that rapidly depletes the resources of</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.310" end="00:03:13.410" style="s2">the land and so actually the cheapest</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.590" end="00:03:15.120" style="s2">input into tobacco production and</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.410" end="00:03:18.290" style="s2">actually later a cotton production had</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.120" end="00:03:22.010" style="s2">this as phenomenon to the cheapest input</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.290" end="00:03:25.260" style="s2">was the free quote unquote free labor of</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.010" end="00:03:27.570" style="s2">ownership of other people of slavery and</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.260" end="00:03:28.770" style="s2">as the the plantation owners would use</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.570" end="00:03:30.660" style="s2">up their land and move from place to</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.770" end="00:03:32.989" style="s2">place they basically laid the</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.660" end="00:03:36.030" style="s2">foundations for the economic collapse</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.989" end="00:03:38.280" style="s2">that helped drive the United States into</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.030" end="00:03:40.950" style="s2">the Civil War so in a similar way</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.280" end="00:03:44.489" style="s2">land-use practices shape the viability</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.950" end="00:03:48.030" style="s2">or susceptibility and vulnerability of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.489" end="00:03:49.560" style="s2">civilization as time goes on so if you</p>
