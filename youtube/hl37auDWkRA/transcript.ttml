<p begin="00:00:58.320" end="00:01:02.640" style="s2">and fabric and it&#39;s the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.480" end="00:01:05.199" style="s2">religion it&#39;s a notion of something</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.640" end="00:01:06.720" style="s2">we can all gather around in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.199" end="00:01:08.720" style="s2">even if we want to</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.720" end="00:01:10.640" style="s2">understand that center as a wandering</p>

<p begin="00:01:14.240" end="00:01:18.640" style="s2">still some inner orientation towards</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.119" end="00:01:21.240" style="s2">something that together we can</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.640" end="00:01:24.159" style="s2">share in and that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.240" end="00:01:26.640" style="s2">bi-directionality to that there&#39;s both</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.159" end="00:01:27.920" style="s2">the classic conservatism and progressive</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.640" end="00:01:30.400" style="s2">thing to put it in</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.920" end="00:01:31.439" style="s2">sort of more topical language but a deep</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.400" end="00:01:33.680" style="s2">care for</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.439" end="00:01:36.240" style="s2">the lineage and the vitality of where</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.680" end="00:01:38.840" style="s2">one&#39;s been where we&#39;ve been together</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.240" end="00:01:41.119" style="s2">and what we&#39;re caring about now and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.840" end="00:01:43.759" style="s2">also what it is we have to</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.119" end="00:01:45.920" style="s2">adapt to and the sort of the the valley</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.759" end="00:01:46.399" style="s2">to cross and the land beyond so how do</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.920" end="00:01:49.840" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.399" end="00:01:50.880" style="s2">reorient such a such a broad thing in</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.840" end="00:01:53.200" style="s2">this time</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.880" end="00:01:54.240" style="s2">i just wonder you know i have a lot to</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.200" end="00:01:56.719" style="s2">say about this but</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.240" end="00:01:57.600" style="s2">i&#39;m wondering where the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.719" end="00:02:01.119" style="s2">religion</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.600" end="00:02:04.399" style="s2">and um plays into this this</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.119" end="00:02:08.879" style="s2">feeling um this sense</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.399" end="00:02:12.319" style="s2">of this</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.879" end="00:02:14.640" style="s2">so so eric you know when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.319" end="00:02:17.840" style="s2">mentioning how you know the that the</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.640" end="00:02:19.520" style="s2">rebel is just as trapped</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.840" end="00:02:21.200" style="s2">it&#39;s like there&#39;s a sense in which</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.520" end="00:02:23.680" style="s2">someone who&#39;s just taking the contrary</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.200" end="00:02:26.080" style="s2">position isn&#39;t yet</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.680" end="00:02:27.840" style="s2">able to really participate in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.080" end="00:02:28.800" style="s2">generative thing together there&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.840" end="00:02:31.040" style="s2">a kind of lock</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.800" end="00:02:32.080" style="s2">there right they might not have a belief</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.040" end="00:02:34.239" style="s2">maybe that</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.080" end="00:02:35.280" style="s2">it is actually possible to to really</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.239" end="00:02:37.360" style="s2">step into</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.280" end="00:02:40.080" style="s2">a deep not knowingness but actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.360" end="00:02:41.920" style="s2">somehow be caught in a kind of process</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.080" end="00:02:43.440" style="s2">to be held in a kind of process or at</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.920" end="00:02:45.360" style="s2">least go there together</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.440" end="00:02:46.879" style="s2">i i you know i&#39;m not saying it always</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.360" end="00:02:49.200" style="s2">has to be like a nice soft</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.879" end="00:02:52.000" style="s2">holy pleasurable thing at all but that</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.200" end="00:02:54.319" style="s2">we can actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.000" end="00:02:56.080" style="s2">go hang on a second like step the</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.319" end="00:02:58.560" style="s2">back is hey</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.080" end="00:02:59.920" style="s2"> is like when when that point</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.560" end="00:03:01.680" style="s2">comes when it&#39;s like no actually we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.920" end="00:03:02.319" style="s2">forgotten some extremely important</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.680" end="00:03:04.560" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.319" end="00:03:06.560" style="s2">you begin to put the put the like steps</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.560" end="00:03:09.680" style="s2">forward a little bit to confront hey</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.560" end="00:03:11.200" style="s2">and go how have we really so have we</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.680" end="00:03:14.159" style="s2">really forgotten something</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.200" end="00:03:15.920" style="s2">can we can we go somewhere together all</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.159" end="00:03:17.120" style="s2">these kind of these energies that i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.920" end="00:03:19.120" style="s2">just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.120" end="00:03:21.599" style="s2">that i&#39;ve infused in this little dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.120" end="00:03:23.360" style="s2">here i&#39;m interested in</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.599" end="00:03:25.599" style="s2">what religion is like how you hold the</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.360" end="00:03:29.680" style="s2">concept of religion and it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.599" end="00:03:33.519" style="s2">in this time yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.680" end="00:03:34.239" style="s2">okay um what comes up for me when i hear</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.519" end="00:03:36.799" style="s2">the word</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.239" end="00:03:38.879" style="s2">religion is that at least how it</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.799" end="00:03:39.760" style="s2">functions in my mind and how i see it</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.879" end="00:03:42.480" style="s2">function in most</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.760" end="00:03:43.760" style="s2">people&#39;s mind is that and young has a</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.480" end="00:03:45.280" style="s2">great quote that i don&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.760" end="00:03:47.920" style="s2">exactly but</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.280" end="00:03:49.840" style="s2">religion is the barrier that keeps</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.920" end="00:03:51.760" style="s2">people from experiencing god</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.840" end="00:03:52.879" style="s2">and the way that i understand that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.760" end="00:03:57.120" style="s2">religion as</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.879" end="00:04:00.159" style="s2">it&#39;s used is a set of principles</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.120" end="00:04:03.280" style="s2">or behaviors that you ought to do</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.159" end="00:04:05.840" style="s2">to be a part or to connect to whatever</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.280" end="00:04:07.200" style="s2">this version of divinity is that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.840" end="00:04:10.640" style="s2">taught to you</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.200" end="00:04:12.480" style="s2">um something about the death of god as</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.640" end="00:04:15.280" style="s2">pronounced by nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.480" end="00:04:17.280" style="s2">ushered in this incredible and probably</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.280" end="00:04:18.079" style="s2">terrible responsibility that it feels</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.280" end="00:04:19.759" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.079" end="00:04:20.959" style="s2">and this is what my life has felt like</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.759" end="00:04:22.240" style="s2">and i&#39;m sure it&#39;s going to resonate for</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.959" end="00:04:24.000" style="s2">both of you is that</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.240" end="00:04:25.919" style="s2">we now live in a time where we have to</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.000" end="00:04:28.720" style="s2">create our own religion</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.919" end="00:04:30.240" style="s2">like personal religion within each of us</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.720" end="00:04:32.080" style="s2">and really on some level i think that</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.240" end="00:04:34.320" style="s2">that&#39;s your personal philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.080" end="00:04:36.080" style="s2">and that the only way to create your</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.320" end="00:04:37.919" style="s2">religion is you have to learn how to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.080" end="00:04:40.320" style="s2">quote unquote spiritual but what i feel</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.919" end="00:04:43.520" style="s2">that means is</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.320" end="00:04:45.759" style="s2">can you learn how to feel into</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.520" end="00:04:46.960" style="s2">what is trying to come out of you and</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.759" end="00:04:49.040" style="s2">then you enact it</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.960" end="00:04:50.800" style="s2">in the world as an experiment and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.040" end="00:04:53.759" style="s2">anything that improves</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.800" end="00:04:55.520" style="s2">the world around you hold that as a</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.759" end="00:04:57.600" style="s2">principle for the time being</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.520" end="00:05:00.320" style="s2">and then continue to act out the</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.600" end="00:05:02.240" style="s2">principles that arise through you</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.320" end="00:05:04.240" style="s2">be humble enough to put down the ones</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.240" end="00:05:06.160" style="s2">that don&#39;t improve your life in the way</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.240" end="00:05:07.919" style="s2">that you feel called to improve it</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.160" end="00:05:11.280" style="s2">and then you slowly start to build up a</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.919" end="00:05:13.120" style="s2">set of you know hypotheses for how to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.280" end="00:05:14.400" style="s2">as a being in the world to make it a</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.120" end="00:05:16.240" style="s2">better place</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.400" end="00:05:17.919" style="s2">and then your being becomes the</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.240" end="00:05:18.960" style="s2">testament of whatever your personal</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.919" end="00:05:21.199" style="s2">religion is</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.960" end="00:05:22.639" style="s2">and then the way admiration function</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.199" end="00:05:24.000" style="s2">people is that it&#39;s not a conscious</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.639" end="00:05:25.680" style="s2">choice you don&#39;t get to choose who you</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.000" end="00:05:26.400" style="s2">admire it&#39;s something that comes through</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.680" end="00:05:28.960" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.400" end="00:05:30.400" style="s2">and so then if people start to admire</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.960" end="00:05:31.840" style="s2">the principles that you&#39;re enacting in</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.400" end="00:05:33.520" style="s2">the world you can use that as more</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.840" end="00:05:37.120" style="s2">feedback and that it</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.520" end="00:05:40.960" style="s2">feels like religion is</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.120" end="00:05:43.520" style="s2">the stultified version of spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.960" end="00:05:44.720" style="s2">and that we live in a time where no</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.520" end="00:05:46.800" style="s2">cement structure</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.720" end="00:05:47.759" style="s2">is going to be the thing that gets us to</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.800" end="00:05:49.360" style="s2">tomorrow</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.759" end="00:05:51.039" style="s2">and that people have to learn how to</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.360" end="00:05:54.000" style="s2">bring forward their</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.039" end="00:05:55.520" style="s2">personal spirituality and then we have</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.000" end="00:05:57.680" style="s2">to communicate</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.520" end="00:05:58.800" style="s2">we have to share what we believe these</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.680" end="00:06:01.120" style="s2">ideas are</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.800" end="00:06:03.360" style="s2">we have to be willing to be seen you</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.120" end="00:06:04.840" style="s2">have to be willing to be critiqued we</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.360" end="00:06:08.319" style="s2">have to be willing to</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.840" end="00:06:11.759" style="s2">transform and my intuition is that</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.319" end="00:06:12.319" style="s2">there&#39;s a collectiveness that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.759" end="00:06:15.600" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.319" end="00:06:17.440" style="s2">through the um rise in connective</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.600" end="00:06:20.479" style="s2">technology where there is</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.440" end="00:06:22.240" style="s2">an unnamed yet religion arising</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.479" end="00:06:23.440" style="s2">that will never be called a religion</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.240" end="00:06:25.520" style="s2">because the moment you call it a</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.440" end="00:06:26.720" style="s2">religion you put you try to put a box</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.520" end="00:06:29.199" style="s2">around god</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.720" end="00:06:30.240" style="s2">but it feels like there&#39;s a new</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.199" end="00:06:33.120" style="s2">spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.240" end="00:06:34.800" style="s2">that&#39;s arising that i hope continues to</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.120" end="00:06:35.840" style="s2">argue with each other in a way where it</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.800" end="00:06:39.759" style="s2">continues to</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.840" end="00:06:43.919" style="s2">adapt and evolve and that i think that</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.759" end="00:06:43.919" style="s2">religion in some sense is dead forever</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.080" end="00:06:49.840" style="s2">through that interpretation of religion</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.800" end="00:06:54.639" style="s2">i think religion&#39;s still got some juice</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.720" end="00:06:58.400" style="s2">in it yet</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.639" end="00:07:00.720" style="s2">but i also think that</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.400" end="00:07:02.560" style="s2">when we talk about religion i mean we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.720" end="00:07:06.240" style="s2">we&#39;re falling into a certain</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.560" end="00:07:07.520" style="s2">kind of um particularly very western</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.240" end="00:07:10.560" style="s2">language game</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.520" end="00:07:12.639" style="s2">yeah and you know religion</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.560" end="00:07:14.319" style="s2">the concept of religion as like a dewey</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.639" end="00:07:17.440" style="s2">decimal category</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.319" end="00:07:20.800" style="s2">um of things in the world</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.440" end="00:07:24.800" style="s2">is i think very tied up with</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.800" end="00:07:27.280" style="s2">um the concept of church orthodoxy</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.800" end="00:07:29.039" style="s2">in this very specific way right and you</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.280" end="00:07:29.520" style="s2">know church orthodoxy obviously didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.039" end="00:07:32.400" style="s2">stop</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.520" end="00:07:34.479" style="s2">gnostics and cathars and greek orthodox</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.400" end="00:07:36.479" style="s2">and russian orthodox and</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.479" end="00:07:37.599" style="s2">right and any number of other split off</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.479" end="00:07:39.360" style="s2">groups um</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.599" end="00:07:41.840" style="s2">and then eventually protestantism which</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.360" end="00:07:45.280" style="s2">really blew the cap off</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.840" end="00:07:48.240" style="s2">but but the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.280" end="00:07:49.440" style="s2">of a sort of like a large centralized</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.240" end="00:07:52.240" style="s2">authority on</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.440" end="00:07:53.680" style="s2">doctrine is of in some sense very</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.240" end="00:07:56.400" style="s2">western right</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.680" end="00:07:58.160" style="s2">when you know uh religious studies</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.400" end="00:07:59.599" style="s2">scholars and anthropologists you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.160" end="00:08:00.400" style="s2">went into other cultures you know we</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.599" end="00:08:03.360" style="s2">went in</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.400" end="00:08:04.160" style="s2">to india and we said you know hinduism</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.360" end="00:08:05.919" style="s2">buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.160" end="00:08:07.680" style="s2">but what we were really describing was</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.919" end="00:08:10.400" style="s2">like a huge variety of</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.680" end="00:08:11.280" style="s2">local practices and local deities and it</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.400" end="00:08:13.440" style="s2">was diverse</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.280" end="00:08:15.759" style="s2">as diverse in a sense as you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.440" end="00:08:18.400" style="s2">languages right language diversity in</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.759" end="00:08:20.080" style="s2">in an area and so you get these</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.400" end="00:08:22.960" style="s2">expressions which obviously</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.080" end="00:08:23.840" style="s2">share a certain amount of underlying you</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.960" end="00:08:25.199" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.840" end="00:08:27.280" style="s2">shared material because the humans are</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.199" end="00:08:27.919" style="s2">in proximity but the idea of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.280" end="00:08:30.479" style="s2">be like</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.919" end="00:08:30.960" style="s2">hinduism it&#39;s not it&#39;s just it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.479" end="00:08:32.880" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.960" end="00:08:34.399" style="s2">in the same way right it&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.880" end="00:08:37.440" style="s2">diversity of expression</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.399" end="00:08:38.880" style="s2">in the diversity um</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.440" end="00:08:41.360" style="s2">and i think that in the same way as</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.880" end="00:08:43.680" style="s2">latin right bound the west</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.360" end="00:08:44.480" style="s2">and the church abound the west religion</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.680" end="00:08:46.959" style="s2">is similarly</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.480" end="00:08:48.560" style="s2">it&#39;s a kind of yoking right it where it</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.959" end="00:08:49.600" style="s2">binds to cultural consciousness in a</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.560" end="00:08:53.760" style="s2">certain way</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.600" end="00:08:56.720" style="s2">now on one hand yeah i think that that</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.760" end="00:08:57.519" style="s2">has probably had at least in its current</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.720" end="00:08:59.839" style="s2">formulation</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.519" end="00:09:01.680" style="s2">sort of its heyday um as this goes</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.839" end="00:09:03.519" style="s2">forward people are going to be playing a</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.680" end="00:09:05.680" style="s2">much more syncretic</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.519" end="00:09:06.880" style="s2">and a much more a little of this on a</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.680" end="00:09:08.959" style="s2">little of that like</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.880" end="00:09:10.399" style="s2">you know going to a nice market kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.959" end="00:09:14.320" style="s2">approach</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.399" end="00:09:18.160" style="s2">but um i guess i think about it</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.320" end="00:09:19.839" style="s2">in two ways one those old rituals</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.160" end="00:09:22.000" style="s2">you know the old rituals the old</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.839" end="00:09:25.120" style="s2">liturgies the old formulations of</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.000" end="00:09:27.360" style="s2">myth uh often have a surprising</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.120" end="00:09:28.720" style="s2">amount of power left in them right um</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.360" end="00:09:31.120" style="s2">provided you can connect</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.720" end="00:09:32.640" style="s2">and you know it&#39;s a little bit like when</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.120" end="00:09:32.880" style="s2">you&#39;re talking in magical terms you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.640" end="00:09:34.959" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.880" end="00:09:36.000" style="s2">in the 70s there was a big rise in chaos</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.959" end="00:09:38.240" style="s2">magic</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.000" end="00:09:39.760" style="s2">and chaos magic had this very like</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.240" end="00:09:41.600" style="s2">idiosyncratic do-it-yourself</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.760" end="00:09:44.080" style="s2">individualize your myth kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.600" end="00:09:45.680" style="s2">hit in the 70s maybe peaked in the 90s</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.080" end="00:09:48.560" style="s2">somewhat declined right</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.680" end="00:09:50.000" style="s2">and it&#39;s a cool idea that you can you</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.560" end="00:09:52.640" style="s2">know do a magical ritual</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.000" end="00:09:54.720" style="s2">and summon you know james bond for</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.640" end="00:09:56.720" style="s2">confidence and that fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.720" end="00:09:57.760" style="s2">what you&#39;re dealing with in any event is</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.720" end="00:10:01.120" style="s2">sort of a narrative</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.760" end="00:10:02.560" style="s2">entity right um however you want to put</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.120" end="00:10:04.800" style="s2">the metaphysics on there</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.560" end="00:10:06.959" style="s2">right um but there is something to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.800" end="00:10:09.600" style="s2">said for the old</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.959" end="00:10:11.120" style="s2">the old stuff like it&#39;s the the blood</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.600" end="00:10:13.200" style="s2">runs deep you have to</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.120" end="00:10:14.720" style="s2">really drill in a sense you have to like</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.200" end="00:10:15.519" style="s2">concentrate to get in but when you</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.720" end="00:10:16.880" style="s2">connect</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.519" end="00:10:18.560" style="s2">you&#39;re connecting with something that</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.880" end="00:10:21.279" style="s2">has the rhythm</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.560" end="00:10:22.640" style="s2">and the routine of generations and</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.279" end="00:10:24.480" style="s2">generations of humans</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.640" end="00:10:25.760" style="s2">it has influenced the culture code in</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.480" end="00:10:27.600" style="s2">all of these ways</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.760" end="00:10:28.959" style="s2">right which is why as much as people</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.600" end="00:10:30.720" style="s2">talk about i just don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.959" end="00:10:31.680" style="s2">christianity for instance is down for</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.720" end="00:10:33.200" style="s2">the count</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.680" end="00:10:35.279" style="s2">i think it&#39;s due for a massive</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.200" end="00:10:38.320" style="s2">transformation that&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.279" end="00:10:41.600" style="s2">1500 years overdue or so</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.320" end="00:10:43.760" style="s2">but um you know but like the</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.600" end="00:10:44.640" style="s2">fundamentals there and some of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.760" end="00:10:46.800" style="s2">fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.640" end="00:10:47.760" style="s2">i mean you know i was raised like half</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.800" end="00:10:51.360" style="s2">catholic</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.760" end="00:10:53.200" style="s2">uh so my mom&#39;s a catholic heretic</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.360" end="00:10:55.519" style="s2">and my dad is nominally anglican but</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.200" end="00:10:58.800" style="s2">he&#39;s actually just a he&#39;s a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.519" end="00:11:01.040" style="s2">pothead science fiction fan so in</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.800" end="00:11:03.040" style="s2">those two streams you know come together</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.040" end="00:11:04.880" style="s2">and so you know i was the questioning</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.040" end="00:11:06.959" style="s2">skeptical kid in my grade school</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.880" end="00:11:08.240" style="s2">um like i got tossed at a religion class</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.959" end="00:11:11.040" style="s2">on the regular</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.240" end="00:11:12.160" style="s2">um but when i reconnected to that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.040" end="00:11:14.959" style="s2">at about 20</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.160" end="00:11:16.720" style="s2">and you know through i wrote a novel</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.959" end="00:11:18.480" style="s2">about christ i started reading the</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.720" end="00:11:20.800" style="s2">gospels in as close to the original</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.480" end="00:11:22.160" style="s2">formulations as possible</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.800" end="00:11:24.320" style="s2">i did a lot of you know general</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.160" end="00:11:26.240" style="s2">scholarship about jesus and i listened</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.320" end="00:11:28.800" style="s2">to jesus christ superstar</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.240" end="00:11:29.839" style="s2">the uh the film version soundtrack</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.800" end="00:11:33.200" style="s2">non-stop</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.839" end="00:11:35.519" style="s2">for like i don&#39;t know months</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.200" end="00:11:36.399" style="s2">um and the effect that that had right</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.519" end="00:11:38.880" style="s2">really just like</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.399" end="00:11:40.800" style="s2">soaked in like i got this this</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.880" end="00:11:42.880" style="s2">tremendous respect for</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.800" end="00:11:44.480" style="s2">um some of those myths and things that i</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.880" end="00:11:45.600" style="s2">had taken for granted as being just like</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.480" end="00:11:48.000" style="s2">down to the count</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.600" end="00:11:50.480" style="s2">right i was like no it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.000" end="00:11:53.760" style="s2">there&#39;s there is a vital current here</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.480" end="00:11:55.200" style="s2">um but it needs something</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.760" end="00:11:56.800" style="s2">and i guess the way that i think about</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.200" end="00:11:58.079" style="s2">it is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.800" end="00:12:00.160" style="s2">you know when we talk about sort of</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.079" end="00:12:02.000" style="s2">spirituality or religion</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.160" end="00:12:03.920" style="s2">when we talk about that binding function</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.000" end="00:12:05.279" style="s2">of religion what we&#39;re talking about is</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.920" end="00:12:07.120" style="s2">authority</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.279" end="00:12:08.480" style="s2">right it&#39;s it&#39;s authority and both like</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.120" end="00:12:10.399" style="s2">in the sense of like</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.480" end="00:12:12.639" style="s2">you know epistemological authority but</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.399" end="00:12:13.519" style="s2">also political authority and right</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.639" end="00:12:16.000" style="s2">authority</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.519" end="00:12:18.160" style="s2">and i think that the way forward and</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.000" end="00:12:20.000" style="s2">obviously this ties into my own work</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.160" end="00:12:21.360" style="s2">is that we need to invest that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.000" end="00:12:24.480" style="s2">authority</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.360" end="00:12:26.880" style="s2">um and and thus the kind of the unity</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.480" end="00:12:28.800" style="s2">that can bind together our experiences</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.880" end="00:12:30.000" style="s2">um in something else and i mean my pitch</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.800" end="00:12:32.959" style="s2">is obviously</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.000" end="00:12:34.720" style="s2">science that science needs to be playing</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.959" end="00:12:36.560" style="s2">an integral role in this</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.720" end="00:12:38.000" style="s2">and that to the extent that science</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.560" end="00:12:40.399" style="s2">stops ignoring this</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.000" end="00:12:41.839" style="s2">and it finally is to be fair and right</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.399" end="00:12:43.279" style="s2">honestly you can go back pretty far</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.839" end="00:12:45.120" style="s2">right scientists in previous</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.279" end="00:12:46.320" style="s2">uh centuries had no problems thinking</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.120" end="00:12:49.040" style="s2">about this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.320" end="00:12:50.800" style="s2">and you know william james right is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.040" end="00:12:53.760" style="s2">huge pioneer of religious</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.800" end="00:12:54.720" style="s2">studies but also of psychology you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.760" end="00:12:56.639" style="s2">at large</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.720" end="00:12:59.040" style="s2">and i think returning to that jamesian</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.639" end="00:13:00.800" style="s2">mold not necessarily perennialism</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.040" end="00:13:02.560" style="s2">of trying to like just everything boils</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.800" end="00:13:05.519" style="s2">down into the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.560" end="00:13:08.000" style="s2">but instead looking at this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.519" end="00:13:11.920" style="s2">scientifically and realizing that</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.000" end="00:13:14.560" style="s2">our shared inheritance</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.920" end="00:13:16.240" style="s2">as human beings massively outweighs the</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.560" end="00:13:18.079" style="s2">differences which doesn&#39;t invalidate the</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.240" end="00:13:21.360" style="s2">differences they&#39;re important</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.079" end="00:13:22.800" style="s2">but it gives us a framework um and to</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.360" end="00:13:23.839" style="s2">the extent that we study it we can</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.800" end="00:13:26.079" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.839" end="00:13:28.240" style="s2">like what is it that matters to us in</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.079" end="00:13:31.519" style="s2">religion well what matters is</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.240" end="00:13:33.120" style="s2">awe in the sense of the sacred the sense</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.519" end="00:13:35.040" style="s2">of transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.120" end="00:13:37.279" style="s2">and the production of meaning and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.040" end="00:13:40.320" style="s2">ability of stories to</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.279" end="00:13:43.600" style="s2">to reflect back and enrich and inform</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.320" end="00:13:44.480" style="s2">and right these are things that we can</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.600" end="00:13:47.920" style="s2">look at</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.480" end="00:13:48.399" style="s2">out of any specific religious context</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.920" end="00:13:50.079" style="s2">and thus</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.399" end="00:13:52.240" style="s2">enable that kind of thing where we can</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.079" end="00:13:54.160" style="s2">be doing personal exploration but</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.240" end="00:13:56.399" style="s2">there&#39;s something that we can</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.160" end="00:13:58.240" style="s2">we can refer back to there&#39;s some you</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.399" end="00:13:59.839" style="s2">know pole star to guide by</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.240" end="00:14:03.839" style="s2">it&#39;s the second time the pole star came</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.839" end="00:14:03.839" style="s2">up anyway</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.560" end="00:14:07.680" style="s2">and the thing that resonates the most</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.079" end="00:14:11.040" style="s2">with me is that it really</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.680" end="00:14:12.399" style="s2">feels like the call of this time is to</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.040" end="00:14:16.480" style="s2">help science</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.399" end="00:14:19.440" style="s2">learn how to bridge to the</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.480" end="00:14:20.880" style="s2">meaning and the value truths inside of</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.440" end="00:14:24.639" style="s2">religion</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.880" end="00:14:26.079" style="s2">and instead of seeking to destroy</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.639" end="00:14:29.360" style="s2">religion</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.079" end="00:14:30.720" style="s2">seeking to integrate religion without</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.360" end="00:14:34.079" style="s2">the orthodoxy</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.720" end="00:14:37.279" style="s2">without the political authority</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.079" end="00:14:40.480" style="s2">and like you know because the</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.279" end="00:14:42.880" style="s2">most the most convincing language of</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.480" end="00:14:44.480" style="s2">modern people now is science or what</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.880" end="00:14:46.399" style="s2">people think is science and there&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.480" end="00:14:46.880" style="s2">sorts of ways that it can be manipulated</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.399" end="00:14:48.959" style="s2">and such</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.880" end="00:14:51.120" style="s2">or at least to the conscious mind and</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.959" end="00:14:53.600" style="s2">that if science can find a bridge to</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.120" end="00:14:54.959" style="s2">religion and to excavate the gold and</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.600" end="00:14:57.040" style="s2">the living</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.959" end="00:15:00.240" style="s2">essence that&#39;s still there i i feel is</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.040" end="00:15:00.240" style="s2">one of the most important tasks</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.800" end="00:15:05.600" style="s2">yeah science i think done right and</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.760" end="00:15:06.959" style="s2">science is often done poorly</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.600" end="00:15:08.399" style="s2">but of course science done right you</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.959" end="00:15:09.920" style="s2">know anytime people get bent out of</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.399" end="00:15:11.279" style="s2">shape it&#39;s like but they just found a</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.920" end="00:15:11.680" style="s2">new thing that contradicted the old</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.279" end="00:15:13.040" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.680" end="00:15:14.880" style="s2">it&#39;s like good then they&#39;re doing their</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.040" end="00:15:15.839" style="s2">job exactly that&#39;s what that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.880" end="00:15:17.760" style="s2">they&#39;re supposed to be doing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.839" end="00:15:20.560" style="s2">supposed to be churning folks</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.760" end="00:15:21.680" style="s2">because you know the whole point is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.560" end="00:15:23.920" style="s2">it&#39;s a constant</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.680" end="00:15:25.279" style="s2">unfolding it&#39;s a constant we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.920" end="00:15:28.079" style="s2">going to get to the end</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.279" end="00:15:29.199" style="s2">science contra what some people think</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.079" end="00:15:32.079" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.199" end="00:15:33.920" style="s2">a terminus it&#39;s not i don&#39;t think anyway</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.079" end="00:15:36.160" style="s2">i mean it could be wrong i suppose</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.920" end="00:15:38.079" style="s2">but i think it&#39;s just like we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.160" end="00:15:39.680" style="s2">going to continue to move into the</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.079" end="00:15:41.920" style="s2">twilight horizon</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.680" end="00:15:43.680" style="s2">and the intuition is that whatever this</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.920" end="00:15:46.079" style="s2">thing is is infinite</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.680" end="00:15:48.000" style="s2">like whatever you want to call it is</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.079" end="00:15:48.320" style="s2">it&#39;s infinite and so of course there is</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.000" end="00:15:49.920" style="s2">no</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.320" end="00:15:51.600" style="s2">end point in the understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.920" end="00:15:53.040" style="s2">infinity right</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.600" end="00:15:55.120" style="s2">and it&#39;s just gonna it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.040" end="00:15:57.040" style="s2">revolutionize as it goes right as our</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.120" end="00:15:59.839" style="s2">sense of scale and our sense of whatever</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.040" end="00:16:00.720" style="s2">in the depth of our dynamics and is</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.839" end="00:16:03.519" style="s2">going to just keep</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.720" end="00:16:04.639" style="s2">turning over and one thing to bring us</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.519" end="00:16:07.920" style="s2">back around</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.639" end="00:16:09.199" style="s2">you know science science in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.920" end="00:16:11.120" style="s2">often runs opposite</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.199" end="00:16:12.639" style="s2">conventional dogmatic narrative because</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.120" end="00:16:15.680" style="s2">it does two things</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.639" end="00:16:17.040" style="s2">it has built into it this process of</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.680" end="00:16:19.839" style="s2">self-revolution</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.040" end="00:16:20.079" style="s2">right very much so in a way that you</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.839" end="00:16:22.880" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.079" end="00:16:24.560" style="s2">theology or something might resist</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.880" end="00:16:26.160" style="s2">fairly strenuously</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.560" end="00:16:28.079" style="s2">but the other of course is that it</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.160" end="00:16:30.000" style="s2">deeply weirds things</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.079" end="00:16:32.079" style="s2">so people often talk about science</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.000" end="00:16:34.160" style="s2">disenchanting the world</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.079" end="00:16:35.600" style="s2">and i i just think that couldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.160" end="00:16:38.639" style="s2">further from the truth</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.600" end="00:16:42.880" style="s2">um common sense takes the</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.639" end="00:16:45.199" style="s2">um takes the um sort of unfamiliar</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.880" end="00:16:46.880" style="s2">and explains it in terms of the familiar</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.199" end="00:16:48.959" style="s2">but science takes the familiar and then</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.880" end="00:16:51.279" style="s2">explains it in terms of the unfamiliar</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.959" end="00:16:52.480" style="s2">yeah it makes everything much weirder</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.279" end="00:16:55.440" style="s2">much weirder</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.480" end="00:16:57.519" style="s2">um and so that right um now whether or</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.440" end="00:17:00.399" style="s2">not culture at large can handle that</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.519" end="00:17:01.199" style="s2">as a central ethos is not clear right</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.399" end="00:17:02.800" style="s2">because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.199" end="00:17:04.400" style="s2">in some ways a minority position that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.800" end="00:17:06.720" style="s2">hard for people to come to</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.400" end="00:17:07.679" style="s2">um it it challenges their sense of</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.720" end="00:17:09.199" style="s2">stability and</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.679" end="00:17:11.360" style="s2">and all kinds of stuff and it pisses</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.199" end="00:17:12.959" style="s2">them off um</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.360" end="00:17:15.039" style="s2">but i think if we could get that going</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.959" end="00:17:16.400" style="s2">and then maybe connect it up i think</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.039" end="00:17:17.520" style="s2">with something else you said which is</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.400" end="00:17:19.240" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.520" end="00:17:21.280" style="s2">the in some sense the the</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.240" end="00:17:23.199" style="s2">democratization or at the very least the</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.280" end="00:17:27.280" style="s2">egalitarian distribution</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.199" end="00:17:30.000" style="s2">of inactive myth-making</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.280" end="00:17:30.799" style="s2">right right so that we&#39;re not being</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.000" end="00:17:32.000" style="s2">given</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.799" end="00:17:34.559" style="s2">myths in the same way but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.000" end="00:17:35.919" style="s2">producing them and</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.559" end="00:17:38.720" style="s2">that&#39;s of course one of the reasons i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.919" end="00:17:41.520" style="s2">so big on on role-playing again</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.720" end="00:17:43.360" style="s2">is i sometimes see it as this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.520" end="00:17:44.720" style="s2">historical emergence it was really</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.360" end="00:17:47.440" style="s2">nothing like it</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.720" end="00:17:49.120" style="s2">60 years ago and 50 years ago it comes</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.440" end="00:17:50.160" style="s2">on the scene and it sort of emerges from</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.120" end="00:17:52.480" style="s2">war gaming</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.160" end="00:17:54.240" style="s2">innocuously but then since then the</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.480" end="00:17:57.440" style="s2">basic concepts and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.240" end="00:17:59.200" style="s2">have been making these steady secret</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.440" end="00:18:00.080" style="s2">invasion kind of inroads into the</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.200" end="00:18:02.480" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.080" end="00:18:03.440" style="s2">that have massively altered the way that</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.480" end="00:18:04.960" style="s2">we think about</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.440" end="00:18:06.799" style="s2">games the way that we think about</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.960" end="00:18:08.400" style="s2">stories right</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.799" end="00:18:10.080" style="s2">mass media you know i don&#39;t think you</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.400" end="00:18:11.039" style="s2">could have game of thrones in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.080" end="00:18:14.320" style="s2">without</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.039" end="00:18:16.000" style="s2">having that kind of gaming and you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.320" end="00:18:17.200" style="s2">the direction people often go on it is</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.000" end="00:18:18.480" style="s2">they&#39;re like well what role-playing</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.200" end="00:18:21.760" style="s2">games do is of course they</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.480" end="00:18:24.240" style="s2">sort of they pre-figure virtual reality</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.760" end="00:18:25.760" style="s2">but and and maybe they do uh certainly</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.240" end="00:18:27.440" style="s2">the language is going to end up borrowed</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.760" end="00:18:28.160" style="s2">the same way as it was for for video</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.440" end="00:18:30.400" style="s2">games right</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.160" end="00:18:32.400" style="s2">uh millions billions of people play</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.400" end="00:18:35.120" style="s2">pokemon and have no idea that</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.400" end="00:18:36.799" style="s2">levels and hp and all that stuff is</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.120" end="00:18:39.360" style="s2">that&#39;s just dnd code</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.799" end="00:18:40.480" style="s2">but um but i think even more interesting</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.360" end="00:18:42.000" style="s2">is like the way that</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.480" end="00:18:44.000" style="s2">especially the current explosion what it</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.000" end="00:18:46.960" style="s2">does is it passes</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.000" end="00:18:47.799" style="s2">it passes these tools for like small</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.960" end="00:18:51.120" style="s2">group</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.799" end="00:18:52.080" style="s2">idiosyncratic myth-making and value</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.120" end="00:18:54.400" style="s2">production</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.080" end="00:18:56.160" style="s2">and dramatic storytelling in in what is</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.400" end="00:18:58.400" style="s2">in many ways the oldest</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.160" end="00:19:00.000" style="s2">art form right verbal storytelling a</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.400" end="00:19:00.400" style="s2">certain amount of animated pictures</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.000" end="00:19:02.880" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.400" end="00:19:03.600" style="s2">it it brings us back to the campfire</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.880" end="00:19:05.120" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.600" end="00:19:06.720" style="s2">you know some rules and some dice</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.120" end="00:19:10.799" style="s2">because we&#39;re grown up and we want to</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.720" end="00:19:14.240" style="s2">you know deflect the arguments</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.799" end="00:19:15.640" style="s2">right but but if we can sort of do</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.240" end="00:19:17.600" style="s2">that and link it up with</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.640" end="00:19:18.799" style="s2">psychotechnologies right if we can go</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.600" end="00:19:21.520" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.799" end="00:19:22.320" style="s2">you know the the shattered cathedrals as</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.520" end="00:19:24.320" style="s2">it were</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.320" end="00:19:26.000" style="s2">and and take the stained glass windows</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.320" end="00:19:27.039" style="s2">out of them and bring them into the</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.000" end="00:19:29.200" style="s2">light</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.039" end="00:19:31.360" style="s2">and and hook them up to something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.200" end="00:19:34.400" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s self-regenerating and</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.360" end="00:19:36.320" style="s2">and sort of weirding like science</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.400" end="00:19:37.919" style="s2">that i think is the sort of engine that</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.320" end="00:19:40.880" style="s2">might actually get us through</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.919" end="00:19:41.679" style="s2">the narrow gate that faces us and i&#39;m an</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.880" end="00:19:44.160" style="s2">optimist too</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.679" end="00:19:45.600" style="s2">to be fair uh i&#39;m just an optimist that</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.160" end="00:19:47.840" style="s2">sweats heavily every time i read the</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.600" end="00:19:47.840" style="s2">news</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.480" end="00:19:53.360" style="s2">i love the idea</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.000" end="00:19:55.600" style="s2">and i got goosebumps when you</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.360" end="00:19:57.760" style="s2">articulated that</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.600" end="00:20:00.400" style="s2">there is something up there is something</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.760" end="00:20:04.240" style="s2">almost implicitly</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.400" end="00:20:06.159" style="s2">in in subversive about role playing in</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.240" end="00:20:08.640" style="s2">the sense that it allows</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.159" end="00:20:09.360" style="s2">people to learn how to generate their</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.640" end="00:20:12.720" style="s2">own myths and</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.360" end="00:20:16.080" style="s2">then to embody those own myths inside of</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.720" end="00:20:19.120" style="s2">a game and game is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.080" end="00:20:20.000" style="s2">oldest like structures that the</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.120" end="00:20:23.200" style="s2">conscious mind</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.000" end="00:20:25.360" style="s2">has created to help guide action and</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.200" end="00:20:26.320" style="s2">i know for me personally like i was</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.360" end="00:20:28.880" style="s2">raised</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.320" end="00:20:29.440" style="s2">on role-playing games not television you</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.880" end="00:20:31.679" style="s2">know like</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.440" end="00:20:33.039" style="s2">i grew up in a family where everyone</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.679" end="00:20:36.320" style="s2">else was watching tv</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.039" end="00:20:37.760" style="s2">but i was playing final fantasy for 50</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.320" end="00:20:41.039" style="s2">or 100 hours and</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.760" end="00:20:42.880" style="s2">i was learning about mythological uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.039" end="00:20:44.720" style="s2">creatures i was looking i was learning</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.880" end="00:20:47.919" style="s2">about gods i was learning about</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.720" end="00:20:50.000" style="s2">what it means to be heroic and like my</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.919" end="00:20:50.640" style="s2">path compared to everyone that i grew up</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.000" end="00:20:53.280" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.640" end="00:20:54.960" style="s2">is so fundamentally different and it</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.280" end="00:20:58.559" style="s2">feels like a huge part of that is</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.960" end="00:20:58.559" style="s2">because i played role playing games</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.799" end="00:21:04.320" style="s2">um yeah and i mean the thing is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.159" end="00:21:07.039" style="s2">and this sometimes surprises me when i</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.320" end="00:21:09.039" style="s2">consider but all that&#39;s in its infancy</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.039" end="00:21:10.480" style="s2">yeah like especially tabletop video</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.039" end="00:21:11.760" style="s2">games of course have inherited a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.480" end="00:21:13.039" style="s2">it and they&#39;ve become massively more</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.760" end="00:21:16.240" style="s2">sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.039" end="00:21:18.720" style="s2">um but even tabletops only 50 years old</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.240" end="00:21:19.600" style="s2">50 years there are a few things that are</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.720" end="00:21:21.840" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.600" end="00:21:23.600" style="s2">you know um go back a little further if</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.840" end="00:21:24.320" style="s2">you sort of dig around in the historical</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.600" end="00:21:26.240" style="s2">record</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.320" end="00:21:27.760" style="s2">but like it&#39;s a more recent technology</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.240" end="00:21:31.120" style="s2">than radio</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.760" end="00:21:32.799" style="s2">and so like you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.120" end="00:21:34.880" style="s2">a significantly more recent technology</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.799" end="00:21:37.760" style="s2">it&#39;s more recent than television</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.880" end="00:21:39.520" style="s2">and yet it&#39;s a kind of it&#39;s a thing that</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.760" end="00:21:40.799" style="s2">it&#39;s almost shocking it never existed i</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.520" end="00:21:42.720" style="s2">mean you could have had it in the roman</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.799" end="00:21:45.919" style="s2">empire they had all the bits</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.720" end="00:21:48.480" style="s2">it&#39;s just that it didn&#39;t emerge and</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.919" end="00:21:49.200" style="s2">i think there&#39;s something that that i</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.480" end="00:21:52.400" style="s2">often</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.200" end="00:21:55.360" style="s2">speculate is there which is that</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.400" end="00:21:57.200" style="s2">when you have a culturally unified ethos</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.360" end="00:21:59.520" style="s2">of storytelling be it religion</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.200" end="00:22:00.559" style="s2">or general mythology and stuff there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.520" end="00:22:03.360" style="s2">already that</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.559" end="00:22:05.120" style="s2">structure and like it&#39;s it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.360" end="00:22:06.480" style="s2">mostly not that it was never used as</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.120" end="00:22:08.799" style="s2">propaganda it was</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.480" end="00:22:10.400" style="s2">but that that being within that</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.799" end="00:22:11.520" style="s2">structure sort of met those needs and</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.400" end="00:22:13.200" style="s2">people so people</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.520" end="00:22:14.720" style="s2">if you were a bard or something maybe</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.200" end="00:22:17.760" style="s2">you you would</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.720" end="00:22:19.840" style="s2">ad lib and write and and embellish and</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.760" end="00:22:22.000" style="s2">tell stories and add stuff and in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.840" end="00:22:23.440" style="s2">oral traditions that&#39;s often the case</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.000" end="00:22:25.360" style="s2">but for everybody else they were just on</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.440" end="00:22:27.280" style="s2">the receiving end and i think</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.360" end="00:22:29.760" style="s2">what we&#39;re really starting to see is</p>

<p begin="00:22:29.760" end="00:22:35.760" style="s2">which takes us back into ritual</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.960" end="00:22:37.919" style="s2">participatory drama is ritual it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.760" end="00:22:38.960" style="s2">putting on a role it&#39;s draping yourself</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.919" end="00:22:41.840" style="s2">in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.960" end="00:22:43.520" style="s2">you know the the animal skin hood yes</p>

<p begin="00:22:48.080" end="00:22:52.159" style="s2">somebody runs games one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.760" end="00:22:55.600" style="s2">that i like to point out to people is</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.159" end="00:22:56.640" style="s2">i play all the bad guys this is the</p>

<p begin="00:23:00.480" end="00:23:05.039" style="s2">because i can just be an absolute</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.240" end="00:23:06.240" style="s2">bastard and that&#39;s what they want</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.039" end="00:23:08.159" style="s2">that&#39;s what everybody wants you want a</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.240" end="00:23:08.960" style="s2">good antagonist no good villain no good</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.159" end="00:23:11.679" style="s2">story</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.960" end="00:23:13.280" style="s2">in a basic story and so i get to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.679" end="00:23:15.919" style="s2">absolutely like</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.280" end="00:23:17.039" style="s2">like a grind and yet i can put it into</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.919" end="00:23:20.240" style="s2">the space</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.039" end="00:23:22.640" style="s2">where everybody gets a cathartic payoff</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.240" end="00:23:23.760" style="s2">where i don&#39;t have to take my</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.640" end="00:23:25.760" style="s2">monstrousness</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.760" end="00:23:27.360" style="s2">uh and excessively embody it in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.760" end="00:23:29.679" style="s2">world um</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.360" end="00:23:31.440" style="s2">right but instead i get to like move</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.679" end="00:23:32.000" style="s2">into these spaces that might otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.440" end="00:23:35.039" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.000" end="00:23:36.720" style="s2">quite frankly kind of terrifying to to</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.039" end="00:23:38.960" style="s2">inhabit in other contexts right</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.720" end="00:23:41.840" style="s2">so yeah i don&#39;t know i sorry i could go</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.960" end="00:23:44.880" style="s2">on about this stuff all day but</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.840" end="00:23:47.760" style="s2">so that really</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.880" end="00:23:49.919" style="s2">um resonated with me is that it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.760" end="00:23:51.679" style="s2">again it&#39;s this idea that like if psyche</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.919" end="00:23:54.640" style="s2">is like the ocean you cannot</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.679" end="00:23:55.520" style="s2">concretize over it it will always burst</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.640" end="00:23:59.279" style="s2">births</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.520" end="00:24:00.400" style="s2">through and that when organized religion</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.279" end="00:24:03.840" style="s2">really lost</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.400" end="00:24:05.039" style="s2">the function that it serves in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.840" end="00:24:07.520" style="s2">psyche when it you know kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.039" end="00:24:09.440" style="s2">disintegrated in the last 100 years</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.520" end="00:24:11.200" style="s2">it had to come out through some other</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.440" end="00:24:13.039" style="s2">way and one of the ways that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.200" end="00:24:13.919" style="s2">erupted back through is through</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.039" end="00:24:16.400" style="s2">role-playing</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.919" end="00:24:18.000" style="s2">i recently read a book called we by</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.400" end="00:24:21.039" style="s2">robert johnson are you familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.000" end="00:24:22.799" style="s2">it i am yeah it&#39;s a whole he she we</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.039" end="00:24:24.080" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s like a sequence of them</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.799" end="00:24:26.960" style="s2">yeah right and</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.080" end="00:24:29.039" style="s2">the idea of we is he articulated that</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.960" end="00:24:29.760" style="s2">one of the other places where the</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.039" end="00:24:32.559" style="s2">function</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.760" end="00:24:33.279" style="s2">that religion sought to meet erupted</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.559" end="00:24:36.080" style="s2">back through</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.279" end="00:24:37.840" style="s2">when the container was kind of destroyed</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.080" end="00:24:39.520" style="s2">is through romantic love</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.840" end="00:24:42.159" style="s2">and that it&#39;s the projection of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.520" end="00:24:43.679" style="s2">divine onto the partner that then allows</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.159" end="00:24:46.320" style="s2">you to work through</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.679" end="00:24:47.279" style="s2">you know all of the aspects that we</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.320" end="00:24:50.080" style="s2">sought to have</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.279" end="00:24:50.720" style="s2">met through religion and so these feel</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.080" end="00:24:54.159" style="s2">like two</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.720" end="00:24:56.799" style="s2">prime examples in our lifetime where</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.159" end="00:24:58.480" style="s2">like young talked about you can destroy</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.799" end="00:24:59.600" style="s2">the container but the archetype will</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.480" end="00:25:02.159" style="s2">just go underground</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.600" end="00:25:03.360" style="s2">you know and that these seem to be two</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.159" end="00:25:07.200" style="s2">of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.360" end="00:25:08.159" style="s2">big primary ways that um whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.200" end="00:25:10.480" style="s2">that the psyche</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.159" end="00:25:12.799" style="s2">seems to need in order for it to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.480" end="00:25:15.200" style="s2">healthy it&#39;s finding new containers and</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.799" end="00:25:16.159" style="s2">two of them are the projection of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.200" end="00:25:18.080" style="s2">you know inner</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.159" end="00:25:19.840" style="s2">god onto the romantic partner and then</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.080" end="00:25:21.840" style="s2">also role playing</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.840" end="00:25:24.320" style="s2">and the other thing that you shared is</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.840" end="00:25:27.440" style="s2">um the catharsis that can come through</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.320" end="00:25:30.000" style="s2">role playing of working out your shadow</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.440" end="00:25:31.120" style="s2">it&#39;s exactly the same type of</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.000" end="00:25:33.440" style="s2">articulation</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.120" end="00:25:34.240" style="s2">that i hear from people that consciously</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.440" end="00:25:37.360" style="s2">explore</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.240" end="00:25:39.840" style="s2">bdsm like what right</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.360" end="00:25:41.200" style="s2">which is structured into scenes and also</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.840" end="00:25:45.039" style="s2">has dungeon masters</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.200" end="00:25:45.679" style="s2">exactly yes and that um what i find is</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.039" end="00:25:49.279" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.679" end="00:25:51.440" style="s2">who have complex ptsd they actually seem</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.279" end="00:25:52.799" style="s2">to be the ones who gravitate towards</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.440" end="00:25:54.480" style="s2">bdsm</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.799" end="00:25:56.080" style="s2">when it&#39;s done consciously and</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.480" end="00:25:59.200" style="s2">intentionally it actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.080" end="00:26:01.600" style="s2">allows them to like almost</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.200" end="00:26:04.080" style="s2">replay the scenes that their inner child</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.600" end="00:26:07.200" style="s2">would had to have played out in order to</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.080" end="00:26:09.840" style="s2">you know not be traumatized</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.200" end="00:26:11.520" style="s2">and it feels like uh i love that you</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.840" end="00:26:13.039" style="s2">just connected scenes and dungeon</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.520" end="00:26:16.240" style="s2">masters and it&#39;s the exact</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.039" end="00:26:19.679" style="s2">like to me all of this</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.240" end="00:26:22.480" style="s2">is more evidence that the psyche</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.679" end="00:26:25.360" style="s2">is so powerful at seeking whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.480" end="00:26:27.520" style="s2">can find in its environment to heal</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.360" end="00:26:29.200" style="s2">and to grow in the same way that</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.520" end="00:26:30.480" style="s2">wherever you plant that</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.200" end="00:26:32.320" style="s2">seed it is going to use</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.480" end="00:26:35.840" style="s2">every possible resource in its</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.320" end="00:26:35.840" style="s2">environment to grow</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.720" end="00:26:41.279" style="s2">yeah i mean one of the things about</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.679" end="00:26:43.520" style="s2">working with the unconscious i think</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.279" end="00:26:43.520" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.760" end="00:26:47.039" style="s2">wonderful but also sometimes frustrating</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.000" end="00:26:50.640" style="s2">right is that</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.039" end="00:26:54.080" style="s2">it exceeds our conscious scope by such a</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.640" end="00:26:55.919" style="s2">huge factor right that it&#39;s like when</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.080" end="00:26:57.840" style="s2">you know people really want a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.919" end="00:26:59.279" style="s2">finality it&#39;s right they want to be able</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.840" end="00:27:01.039" style="s2">to go through a process and finish it</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.279" end="00:27:03.120" style="s2">it&#39;s like no you don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.039" end="00:27:04.640" style="s2">like you never you&#39;re never done you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.120" end="00:27:06.480" style="s2">never done</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.640" end="00:27:08.080" style="s2">because you can&#39;t be because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.480" end="00:27:09.120" style="s2">impossible because it&#39;s so much bigger</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.080" end="00:27:12.559" style="s2">than you right</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.120" end="00:27:16.240" style="s2">and by the same token um</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.559" end="00:27:19.520" style="s2">i think you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.240" end="00:27:22.080" style="s2">you know the fact is that it&#39;s it&#39;s thus</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.520" end="00:27:23.840" style="s2">more adaptable than we are and more</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.080" end="00:27:25.039" style="s2">mercurial than we are it can always find</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.840" end="00:27:27.760" style="s2">another way in</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.039" end="00:27:28.320" style="s2">it&#39;s smarter than we are in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.760" end="00:27:30.159" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.320" end="00:27:32.159" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter which what</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.159" end="00:27:34.000" style="s2">constructions we end up putting up</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.159" end="00:27:35.679" style="s2">it can figure out a way around and my</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.000" end="00:27:36.960" style="s2">experience with complexes especially i</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.679" end="00:27:37.600" style="s2">mean even if they&#39;re kind of screwing</p>

<p begin="00:27:45.520" end="00:27:48.640" style="s2">i i have to admit that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.720" end="00:27:50.880" style="s2">something that worries me a bit</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.640" end="00:27:51.840" style="s2">when i consider it um i remember</p>

<p begin="00:29:06.960" end="00:29:09.200" style="s2">lot of that is about the erosion of</p>

<p begin="00:30:30.240" end="00:30:32.000" style="s2">you&#39;ve mentioned the importance of</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.200" end="00:30:33.840" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.000" end="00:30:35.679" style="s2">the importance of participatory myth</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.840" end="00:30:37.120" style="s2">making put that into a slightly</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.679" end="00:30:39.760" style="s2">different category like</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.120" end="00:30:40.960" style="s2">the playing it out in a way that is</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.760" end="00:30:43.520" style="s2">evocative or</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.960" end="00:30:45.120" style="s2">enabling of growth together and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.520" end="00:30:47.520" style="s2">also spoken about</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.120" end="00:30:49.279" style="s2">the importance um or we&#39;ve sort of</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.520" end="00:30:51.919" style="s2">spoken about the</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.279" end="00:30:53.200" style="s2">the fragmentation and the breakdown of</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.919" end="00:30:54.960" style="s2">religious structures</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.200" end="00:30:56.720" style="s2">where previously there had been a</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.960" end="00:30:58.320" style="s2">congregation um and</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.720" end="00:31:00.480" style="s2">before then we&#39;ve got these notions of</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.320" end="00:31:02.480" style="s2">tribe and we&#39;ve just moved on to</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.480" end="00:31:04.960" style="s2">speaking about how it&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.480" end="00:31:07.080" style="s2">inappropriate to sort of conduit what</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.960" end="00:31:10.080" style="s2">was this um</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.080" end="00:31:10.399" style="s2">multi-nodal network that one was a part</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.080" end="00:31:13.120" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.399" end="00:31:18.080" style="s2">through like one specific point like one</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.120" end="00:31:21.600" style="s2">specific person too much of a pivot um</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.080" end="00:31:23.600" style="s2">and i&#39;m feeling like i&#39;m feeling like</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.600" end="00:31:27.200" style="s2">there&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.600" end="00:31:30.720" style="s2">a lot obviously to save here in religion</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.200" end="00:31:33.760" style="s2">um and i can appreciate the point about</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.720" end="00:31:36.960" style="s2">um words becoming unworkable</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.760" end="00:31:36.960" style="s2">in some important sense</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.760" end="00:31:42.240" style="s2">and something that was coming to me i</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.880" end="00:31:44.640" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.240" end="00:31:46.320" style="s2">that might thematically bring a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.640" end="00:31:48.720" style="s2">this together it&#39;s the idea that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.320" end="00:31:49.519" style="s2">spoken about quite a bit which is which</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.720" end="00:31:52.000" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.519" end="00:31:54.000" style="s2">you know the church is not the building</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.000" end="00:31:55.360" style="s2">it&#39;s the people who have the capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.000" end="00:31:58.480" style="s2">build churches</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.360" end="00:32:00.080" style="s2">um and concrete you know concrete</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.480" end="00:32:01.519" style="s2">churches is actually really helpful to</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.080" end="00:32:02.159" style="s2">get through the night to get to the next</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.519" end="00:32:04.480" style="s2">day</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.159" end="00:32:05.279" style="s2">it&#39;s just that we want to not mistake</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.480" end="00:32:07.519" style="s2">the church</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.279" end="00:32:08.960" style="s2">for the actual thing it&#39;s our capacity</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.519" end="00:32:11.519" style="s2">to religion as</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.960" end="00:32:12.840" style="s2">reconnect together to in an ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.519" end="00:32:15.279" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.840" end="00:32:18.880" style="s2">realize what</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.279" end="00:32:22.640" style="s2">the kind of um wandering structure</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.880" end="00:32:25.440" style="s2">enabling of our ongoing adaptivity</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.640" end="00:32:26.000" style="s2">and um protection from that which would</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.440" end="00:32:29.840" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.000" end="00:32:32.880" style="s2">pull us apart or too much entropy</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.840" end="00:32:33.679" style="s2">um or what have you so that we can um go</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.880" end="00:32:36.240" style="s2">out and face</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.679" end="00:32:37.039" style="s2">another day that we can rejuvenate you</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.240" end="00:32:40.080" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.039" end="00:32:43.919" style="s2">this idea of a kind of a integration as</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.080" end="00:32:45.679" style="s2">um metabolizing in good company</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.919" end="00:32:47.279" style="s2">was something that came to me the other</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.679" end="00:32:50.080" style="s2">day that i quite liked and was something</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.279" end="00:32:52.720" style="s2">i so realized i was seeking after some</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.080" end="00:32:54.000" style="s2">particular sort of energetic expenditure</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.720" end="00:32:55.279" style="s2">just to hang out with friends and eat</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.000" end="00:32:56.000" style="s2">some food which is something difficult</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.279" end="00:32:57.679" style="s2">for me at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.000" end="00:32:59.279" style="s2">because we&#39;re under curfew here or in</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.679" end="00:32:59.840" style="s2">fact we&#39;re not now as of a couple days</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.279" end="00:33:01.600" style="s2">ago</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.840" end="00:33:04.159" style="s2">but we were for like 10 weeks or so in</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.600" end="00:33:07.760" style="s2">melbourne which has been quite a trip</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.159" end="00:33:12.399" style="s2">um something else was this um</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.760" end="00:33:15.600" style="s2">this frustration with religion as</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.399" end="00:33:17.279" style="s2">too much of a concrete authority</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.600" end="00:33:18.960" style="s2">but that if we can shift this to some</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.279" end="00:33:23.200" style="s2">sort of more flexible</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.960" end="00:33:24.880" style="s2">religion as ennobling and enabling of</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.200" end="00:33:27.679" style="s2">our authorship</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.880" end="00:33:29.360" style="s2">over our connectedness together on an</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.679" end="00:33:31.120" style="s2">ongoing basis that this is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.360" end="00:33:34.320" style="s2">helpful</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.120" end="00:33:35.919" style="s2">um but i i wonder about you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.320" end="00:33:39.039" style="s2">part of me that wants to actually</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.919" end="00:33:40.399" style="s2">um being in digging a little bit to what</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.039" end="00:33:43.200" style="s2">we mean by science</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.399" end="00:33:43.600" style="s2">because i&#39;m seeing science here is in</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.200" end="00:33:45.200" style="s2">fact</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.600" end="00:33:46.640" style="s2">not the container within which</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.200" end="00:33:49.840" style="s2">everything else is sitting</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.640" end="00:33:51.760" style="s2">and in fact that that the curious spirit</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.840" end="00:33:54.080" style="s2">of the scientific approach to the world</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.760" end="00:33:55.600" style="s2">to continually sort of disconfirm what</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.080" end="00:33:57.840" style="s2">one previously thought to be the case</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.600" end="00:34:01.120" style="s2">and continue to move towards</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.840" end="00:34:03.840" style="s2">some sort of um more real pattern</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.120" end="00:34:04.159" style="s2">in that sense is itself the will for</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.840" end="00:34:06.159" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.159" end="00:34:07.200" style="s2">we can just as well say is more lit by</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.159" end="00:34:09.679" style="s2">something you know</p>

<p begin="00:34:16.879" end="00:34:20.240" style="s2">plays a very sort of um important role</p>

<p begin="00:34:20.240" end="00:34:23.440" style="s2">and it kind of partly comes up in this</p>

<p begin="00:34:38.159" end="00:34:43.679" style="s2">and please like maybe this is not so</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.280" end="00:34:45.280" style="s2">i like it i&#39;m hoping this kind of</p>

<p begin="00:35:58.400" end="00:36:02.240" style="s2">cannot in some sense we should not see</p>

<p begin="00:36:22.720" end="00:36:26.400" style="s2">yeah um i mean science at the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.599" end="00:36:28.240" style="s2">day</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.400" end="00:36:30.240" style="s2">the experimental method and whatever</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.240" end="00:36:30.560" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s one more psychotechnology</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.240" end="00:36:34.000" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.560" end="00:36:35.680" style="s2">so one more tool in the kit um</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.000" end="00:36:37.680" style="s2">it&#39;s a tool that does certain</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.680" end="00:36:39.599" style="s2">particularly good things</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.680" end="00:36:40.800" style="s2">as good at generating sort of certain</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.599" end="00:36:44.720" style="s2">kinds of communal</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.800" end="00:36:47.359" style="s2">questions it&#39;s very good at taking</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.720" end="00:36:48.000" style="s2">small things and refining them to the</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.359" end="00:36:49.440" style="s2">point of</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.000" end="00:36:51.599" style="s2">being able to get a particular kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.440" end="00:36:54.079" style="s2">effect reliably right</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.599" end="00:36:55.680" style="s2">and i think that that general thing i</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.079" end="00:36:56.960" style="s2">mean you think about</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.680" end="00:36:59.440" style="s2">you know we&#39;re having this call right</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.960" end="00:37:00.720" style="s2">now um i think we&#39;re in three different</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.440" end="00:37:02.320" style="s2">countries</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.720" end="00:37:04.640" style="s2">aren&#39;t we i didn&#39;t ask where eric where</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.320" end="00:37:06.240" style="s2">are you uh texas</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.640" end="00:37:08.560" style="s2">texas so definitely we&#39;re in three</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.240" end="00:37:11.440" style="s2">different countries yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.560" end="00:37:12.000" style="s2">um so we&#39;re in three different countries</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.440" end="00:37:13.440" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.000" end="00:37:14.880" style="s2">spanning across various points in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.440" end="00:37:16.400" style="s2">globe we&#39;re bouncing the off</p>

<p begin="00:37:16.400" end="00:37:19.920" style="s2">optic cables right</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.079" end="00:37:21.680" style="s2">all of this comes out of a technological</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.920" end="00:37:23.280" style="s2">innovation which was you know a little</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.680" end="00:37:25.200" style="s2">over 100 years ago</p>

<p begin="00:37:43.520" end="00:37:48.240" style="s2">very good at that and so you know there</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.480" end="00:37:51.760" style="s2">are certain kinds of questions that i</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.240" end="00:37:53.280" style="s2">think science can&#39;t really get at i mean</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.760" end="00:37:54.800" style="s2">this is jung&#39;s point essentially</p>

<p begin="00:37:54.800" end="00:38:00.240" style="s2">um i about sort of um</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.000" end="00:38:01.040" style="s2">the relationship between the self and</p>

<p begin="00:38:01.040" end="00:38:07.839" style="s2">and and how that fits together with</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.160" end="00:38:09.920" style="s2">agnosticism right which is</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.839" end="00:38:12.160" style="s2">you know at some level it&#39;s just</p>

<p begin="00:38:19.040" end="00:38:22.480" style="s2">that would actually definitively you</p>

<p begin="00:39:48.400" end="00:39:50.240" style="s2">speaking the language it chooses to</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.839" end="00:39:55.040" style="s2">speak</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.240" end="00:39:56.880" style="s2">which chakra is symbols and rituals and</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.040" end="00:39:59.200" style="s2">right like that&#39;s how it speaks and</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.880" end="00:39:59.520" style="s2">that&#39;s how it it&#39;s how you can interface</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.200" end="00:40:01.920" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.520" end="00:40:02.720" style="s2">in the way that poetry cuts more than</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.920" end="00:40:04.480" style="s2">prose</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.720" end="00:40:07.280" style="s2">if you know what i mean like a poem has</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.480" end="00:40:09.760" style="s2">a like a concentrated charge to it</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.280" end="00:40:11.440" style="s2">and you know there&#39;s using religious</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.760" end="00:40:13.040" style="s2">language and symbolism that way has that</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.440" end="00:40:14.880" style="s2">kind of concentrated charge</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.040" end="00:40:17.119" style="s2">so you end up doing the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.880" end="00:40:19.040" style="s2">whether you&#39;re addressing just some like</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.119" end="00:40:20.480" style="s2">you know genetic predisposition that you</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.040" end="00:40:21.280" style="s2">have to have a little twist in your</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.480" end="00:40:23.280" style="s2">brain that does</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.280" end="00:40:25.200" style="s2">such and such and such or whether you</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.280" end="00:40:27.680" style="s2">are in some sense dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.200" end="00:40:28.800" style="s2">you know the the uh the boiling heart of</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.680" end="00:40:31.680" style="s2">creation</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.800" end="00:40:33.119" style="s2">uh doesn&#39;t matter you got to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.680" end="00:40:35.359" style="s2">it kind of in the same way</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.119" end="00:40:36.720" style="s2">so science i think can&#39;t answer</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.359" end="00:40:38.240" style="s2">questions like that like there are</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.720" end="00:40:38.960" style="s2">mysteries that in my opinion science</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.240" end="00:40:40.160" style="s2">cannot</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.960" end="00:40:42.000" style="s2">get at i sometimes wonder if</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.160" end="00:40:43.520" style="s2">consciousness is one of those i mean i</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.000" end="00:40:44.800" style="s2">do work in that area so i have high</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.520" end="00:40:47.119" style="s2">hopes that</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.800" end="00:40:48.160" style="s2">if we&#39;re making actual progress but if</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.119" end="00:40:51.280" style="s2">i&#39;m honest</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.160" end="00:40:53.680" style="s2">like the hard problem is a hard problem</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.280" end="00:40:55.119" style="s2">yeah and the problems of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.680" end="00:40:56.640" style="s2">are hard and there are lots of these</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.119" end="00:40:58.240" style="s2">things you know that</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.640" end="00:41:00.560" style="s2">science ultimately can&#39;t get at there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.240" end="00:41:03.599" style="s2">a there&#39;s a horizon of mystery you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.560" end="00:41:06.720" style="s2">um but what it&#39;s super good at</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.599" end="00:41:07.920" style="s2">is these like concentrated hole poking</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.720" end="00:41:10.800" style="s2">exercises</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.920" end="00:41:12.319" style="s2">which then open a possibility and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.800" end="00:41:15.359" style="s2">what science does and once it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.319" end="00:41:19.040" style="s2">right you can&#39;t disprove things right</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.359" end="00:41:21.040" style="s2">but you can you can make the possibility</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.040" end="00:41:22.960" style="s2">of something real like so you only need</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.040" end="00:41:24.800" style="s2">whatever one black swan to prove the</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.960" end="00:41:28.640" style="s2">existence of black swans</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.800" end="00:41:30.319" style="s2">right you need one jab one credible</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.640" end="00:41:31.760" style="s2">jab with science and then we can</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.319" end="00:41:35.119" style="s2">elaborate the hell out of it</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.760" end="00:41:36.160" style="s2">and if that jab is is is something that</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.119" end="00:41:38.880" style="s2">lets us</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.160" end="00:41:40.880" style="s2">poke through i think these like you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.880" end="00:41:44.000" style="s2">these concrete barriers these</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.880" end="00:41:45.520" style="s2">filmy things that we have between us</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.000" end="00:41:47.599" style="s2">and some kind of more authentic</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.520" end="00:41:48.400" style="s2">relationship with each other with nature</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.599" end="00:41:52.160" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.400" end="00:41:55.200" style="s2">being right then if science can just</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.160" end="00:41:56.960" style="s2">get the hole in there based on studying</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.200" end="00:41:58.560" style="s2">what religion has already been doing</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.960" end="00:42:01.040" style="s2">then everybody else in science can just</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.560" end="00:42:03.119" style="s2">go at it and pull that thing open and in</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.040" end="00:42:05.920" style="s2">100 years we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.119" end="00:42:07.200" style="s2">whatever the transition is to where we</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.920" end="00:42:08.960" style="s2">are now technologically with</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.200" end="00:42:09.839" style="s2">telecommunications equivalent is you</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.960" end="00:42:11.760" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.839" end="00:42:14.000" style="s2">um that&#39;s that&#39;s where i place my hope</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.760" end="00:42:17.200" style="s2">in science and it&#39;s fantastically good</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.000" end="00:42:18.960" style="s2">at doing that particular thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.200" end="00:42:20.800" style="s2">and i think some people are scared</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.960" end="00:42:23.000" style="s2">sometimes i&#39;m scared about</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.800" end="00:42:24.160" style="s2">you know some the instrument the</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.000" end="00:42:27.760" style="s2">instrumentalization</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.160" end="00:42:29.119" style="s2">i guess of the sacred you know um</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.760" end="00:42:31.520" style="s2">and i used to work in that field that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.119" end="00:42:33.359" style="s2">a whole other story um</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.520" end="00:42:35.359" style="s2">but um but i don&#39;t know i think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.359" end="00:42:36.640" style="s2">a lot of promise</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.359" end="00:42:39.520" style="s2">there was something that jumped out</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.640" end="00:42:42.880" style="s2">about what you had just said tim and how</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.520" end="00:42:44.960" style="s2">it bounced off what eric said and</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.880" end="00:42:46.880" style="s2">what i thought was it&#39;s interesting you</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.960" end="00:42:49.200" style="s2">guys have talked about</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.880" end="00:42:51.280" style="s2">this like the the issues that people</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.200" end="00:42:53.440" style="s2">have and i realized it&#39;s like oh</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.280" end="00:42:54.640" style="s2">it&#39;s the conflation of abstraction and</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.440" end="00:42:57.280" style="s2">concreteness</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.640" end="00:42:58.079" style="s2">in both directions when you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.280" end="00:43:00.720" style="s2">about the concrete</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.079" end="00:43:02.560" style="s2">boxes right and every time you say it i</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.720" end="00:43:03.920" style="s2">find the song little boxes running</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.560" end="00:43:06.079" style="s2">through my head you know that song yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.920" end="00:43:06.960" style="s2">yeah little box is made of ticky tacky</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.079" end="00:43:08.400" style="s2">oh it&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.960" end="00:43:10.319" style="s2">there&#39;s a death cab for cutie version</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.400" end="00:43:12.640" style="s2">that i quite like i recommend</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.319" end="00:43:14.560" style="s2">so uh you know little boxes right and</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.640" end="00:43:16.800" style="s2">and these like nested boxes</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.560" end="00:43:18.960" style="s2">and what is that that&#39;s us you know what</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.800" end="00:43:20.240" style="s2">are the boxes the boxes are abstractions</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.960" end="00:43:22.560" style="s2">but they&#39;re abstractions that we take to</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.240" end="00:43:25.599" style="s2">be concrete right right</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.560" end="00:43:27.920" style="s2">and then tim what you were mentioning is</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.599" end="00:43:29.760" style="s2">is sort of the opposite right it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.920" end="00:43:32.880" style="s2">conflation where</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.760" end="00:43:33.680" style="s2">we take things that are concrete and we</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.880" end="00:43:36.560" style="s2">treat them</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.680" end="00:43:38.480" style="s2">abstractly we treat them highly</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.560" end="00:43:39.359" style="s2">abstractly and so we seem to get jammed</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.480" end="00:43:42.480" style="s2">in both</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.359" end="00:43:43.680" style="s2">directions right um</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.480" end="00:43:45.760" style="s2">and i don&#39;t remember where that thought</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.680" end="00:43:47.280" style="s2">was pointing but it did occur to me</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.760" end="00:43:49.200" style="s2">yeah and the thing that arises in me is</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.280" end="00:43:52.640" style="s2">that actually touches beautifully</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.200" end="00:43:54.960" style="s2">on um what i see as like the marriage</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.640" end="00:43:55.680" style="s2">that can happen between science and the</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.960" end="00:43:59.040" style="s2">sacred</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.680" end="00:44:01.599" style="s2">is deciding what can be cr</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.040" end="00:44:02.160" style="s2">what can be concretized and what is</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.599" end="00:44:04.960" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.160" end="00:44:07.200" style="s2">made more sacred through concretizing it</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.960" end="00:44:10.480" style="s2">which i think is the realm of science</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.200" end="00:44:11.359" style="s2">and then what needs to not be</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.480" end="00:44:13.920" style="s2">concretized</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.359" end="00:44:16.079" style="s2">that needs to stay abstractions that</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.920" end="00:44:18.079" style="s2">needs to stay symbolic and that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.079" end="00:44:20.079" style="s2">actually how you get the most</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.079" end="00:44:22.000" style="s2">you know like the reason we concretize</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.079" end="00:44:24.480" style="s2">is to attempt to get more functionality</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.000" end="00:44:26.640" style="s2">or usefulness out of it and that by not</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.480" end="00:44:28.720" style="s2">concretizing the sacred you actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.640" end="00:44:31.200" style="s2">get the function that you seek from</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.720" end="00:44:34.240" style="s2">concretizing it like one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.200" end="00:44:36.400" style="s2">as a coach that comes up more</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.240" end="00:44:37.440" style="s2">like especially for people who are just</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.400" end="00:44:40.640" style="s2">beginning to use</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.440" end="00:44:42.720" style="s2">plants to like alter consciousness is do</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.640" end="00:44:45.520" style="s2">not concretize</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.720" end="00:44:47.680" style="s2">the symbols and people want to</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.520" end="00:44:50.480" style="s2">concretize the symbols that</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.680" end="00:44:51.359" style="s2">make them feel huge and god-like and</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.480" end="00:44:53.280" style="s2">grand</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.359" end="00:44:54.800" style="s2">and then anything that comes that is</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.280" end="00:44:56.800" style="s2">scary i&#39;ll leave that in</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.800" end="00:44:58.800" style="s2">abstraction and it comes up in dream</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.800" end="00:45:01.839" style="s2">interpretation all the time</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.800" end="00:45:04.079" style="s2">and that feels like like</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.839" end="00:45:06.079" style="s2">if we can discern between the usefulness</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.079" end="00:45:08.000" style="s2">of what needs to be concretized and what</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.079" end="00:45:10.000" style="s2">needs to be left symbolic i think that</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.000" end="00:45:12.000" style="s2">that&#39;s how we can</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.000" end="00:45:14.319" style="s2">get the most out of what feels like</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.000" end="00:45:16.400" style="s2">these two dominant spheres which is like</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.319" end="00:45:18.000" style="s2">the essence of science and the essence</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.400" end="00:45:20.400" style="s2">of the sacred</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.000" end="00:45:20.400" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.280" end="00:45:27.280" style="s2">yeah the it&#39;s interesting it</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.319" end="00:45:27.680" style="s2">for sure with dream interpretation right</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.280" end="00:45:31.440" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.680" end="00:45:34.720" style="s2">there&#39;s always that and even i</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.440" end="00:45:36.640" style="s2">had this in in analysis</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.720" end="00:45:39.280" style="s2">there&#39;s always this tendency to hit the</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.640" end="00:45:41.599" style="s2">like the facile</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.280" end="00:45:42.960" style="s2">interpretation right the simplest thing</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.599" end="00:45:44.720" style="s2">you know you dream about</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.960" end="00:45:46.319" style="s2">your aunt and it&#39;s like oh it&#39;s about my</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.720" end="00:45:49.280" style="s2">aunt it&#39;s like no it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.319" end="00:45:49.280" style="s2">no it&#39;s about you</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.359" end="00:45:52.960" style="s2">you know or it&#39;s it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.880" end="00:45:54.880" style="s2">transitive right right so it points both</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.960" end="00:45:56.880" style="s2">ways and but that&#39;s even harder</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.880" end="00:45:58.400" style="s2">to really wrap your head around the idea</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.880" end="00:45:59.359" style="s2">that it&#39;s like yes it points into the</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.400" end="00:46:01.599" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.359" end="00:46:03.760" style="s2">but also it&#39;s pointing to yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.599" end="00:46:06.480" style="s2">the genius of the dream maker</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.760" end="00:46:07.440" style="s2">is that it manages to perfectly clothe</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.480" end="00:46:10.720" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.440" end="00:46:13.440" style="s2">to the other it&#39;s it&#39;s the the bone mo</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.720" end="00:46:14.319" style="s2">right the fact where you know a really</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.440" end="00:46:17.280" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.319" end="00:46:18.240" style="s2">word in a poem is not accidental and</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.280" end="00:46:20.720" style="s2">it&#39;s just so</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.240" end="00:46:22.319" style="s2">right and dreams are just so in that</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.720" end="00:46:23.680" style="s2">young way it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.319" end="00:46:25.440" style="s2">that&#39;s a big difference in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.680" end="00:46:28.079" style="s2">right between the union and the freudian</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.440" end="00:46:28.720" style="s2">it&#39;s like 100 yes a pen and a knife</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.079" end="00:46:31.119" style="s2">aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.720" end="00:46:31.920" style="s2">just penises i mean maybe they are a bit</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.119" end="00:46:33.599" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.920" end="00:46:37.680" style="s2">you know if there&#39;s a knife in your</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.599" end="00:46:40.240" style="s2">dream it&#39;s because it&#39;s a knife</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.680" end="00:46:41.680" style="s2">it&#39;s a knife and not something else and</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.240" end="00:46:45.359" style="s2">so what&#39;s a knife</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.680" end="00:46:48.160" style="s2">why that it&#39;s not accidental why a knife</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.359" end="00:46:49.359" style="s2">and so you know that but getting that</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.160" end="00:46:51.760" style="s2">down that like</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.359" end="00:46:53.359" style="s2">fine-tuning the level of abstraction and</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.760" end="00:46:55.920" style="s2">getting it pointing in both directions</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.359" end="00:46:55.920" style="s2">it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.400" end="00:47:02.640" style="s2">yeah yeah it&#39;s hard um that can help us</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.560" end="00:47:04.880" style="s2">with this and is there a myth that can</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.640" end="00:47:06.640" style="s2">help sort of um</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.880" end="00:47:08.400" style="s2">place this relationship between the</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.640" end="00:47:10.160" style="s2">abstraction and the concrete as we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.400" end="00:47:12.319" style="s2">come to use them in this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.160" end="00:47:13.359" style="s2">because i don&#39;t i have them in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.319" end="00:47:15.040" style="s2">i have them locked but</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.359" end="00:47:17.440" style="s2">in another sense i find myself looking</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.040" end="00:47:19.599" style="s2">for more clarity</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.440" end="00:47:20.559" style="s2">for the one eric was talking about which</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.599" end="00:47:22.400" style="s2">is this like</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.559" end="00:47:24.240" style="s2">as people are doing this work they often</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.400" end="00:47:25.440" style="s2">want to concretize the symbols that</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.240" end="00:47:27.920" style="s2">inflate them</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.440" end="00:47:29.920" style="s2">right they want to turn things into good</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.920" end="00:47:31.280" style="s2">like talesmans they can clutch onto so</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.920" end="00:47:32.079" style="s2">they can smash through the rest of their</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.280" end="00:47:34.880" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.079" end="00:47:36.640" style="s2">uh icarus it&#39;s the myth of icarus that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.880" end="00:47:39.359" style="s2">the classic inflation myth</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.640" end="00:47:39.839" style="s2">you know so you trapped in the labyrinth</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.359" end="00:47:41.760" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.839" end="00:47:43.280" style="s2">um because your father is the labyrinth</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.760" end="00:47:45.200" style="s2">maker because</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.280" end="00:47:47.119" style="s2">some king&#39;s wife slept with a sacred</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.200" end="00:47:48.480" style="s2">bowl they always go way back right they</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.119" end="00:47:50.640" style="s2">always chain into each other but the</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.480" end="00:47:53.359" style="s2">point is you&#39;re stuck in a labyrinth</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.640" end="00:47:53.839" style="s2">and your father of course is brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.359" end="00:47:55.920" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.839" end="00:47:57.520" style="s2">and and a god-like kind of creator and</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.920" end="00:47:59.839" style="s2">so he fashions wings</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.520" end="00:48:01.040" style="s2">but he warns you don&#39;t fly too high</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.839" end="00:48:03.200" style="s2">don&#39;t fly too low</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.040" end="00:48:04.800" style="s2">it&#39;s goldilocks don&#39;t fly too high don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.200" end="00:48:05.359" style="s2">fly too low we always remember that too</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.800" end="00:48:07.440" style="s2">high</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.359" end="00:48:09.040" style="s2">we never remember the too low right we</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.440" end="00:48:10.800" style="s2">never we always remember because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.040" end="00:48:12.160" style="s2">what he did right he flies up towards</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.800" end="00:48:15.040" style="s2">the sun and in so doing</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.160" end="00:48:16.720" style="s2">heats up too much and he&#39;s in the drink</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.040" end="00:48:18.079" style="s2">but he equally could have if he had</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.720" end="00:48:19.440" style="s2">flown too low</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.079" end="00:48:21.119" style="s2">right he would have picked up too much</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.440" end="00:48:24.319" style="s2">moisture on the wings</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.119" end="00:48:26.400" style="s2">and so this this middle path right and</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.319" end="00:48:27.599" style="s2">somehow being able to transition those</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.400" end="00:48:29.040" style="s2">is sort of central</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.599" end="00:48:31.040" style="s2">in some way icarus i mean think about</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.040" end="00:48:32.559" style="s2">what to fly as a bird you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.040" end="00:48:34.160" style="s2">muscular action but you&#39;re also like</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.559" end="00:48:37.280" style="s2">riding up drafts and</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.160" end="00:48:38.640" style="s2">there&#39;s a dynamic quality to it to going</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.280" end="00:48:41.359" style="s2">through the middle</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.640" end="00:48:42.319" style="s2">and yeah for sure with with plant</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.359" end="00:48:45.200" style="s2">teachers</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.319" end="00:48:47.040" style="s2">with mystical experiences generally um</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.200" end="00:48:48.160" style="s2">certainly with meditative experiences</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.040" end="00:48:51.200" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.160" end="00:48:54.559" style="s2">the drive towards inflation is so</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.200" end="00:48:58.880" style="s2">powerful and it&#39;s so tricky um it wants</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.559" end="00:49:01.359" style="s2">to convince you that you are you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.880" end="00:49:02.559" style="s2">the archetype yeah that you&#39;re the right</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.359" end="00:49:04.559" style="s2">you&#39;re the new messiah</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.559" end="00:49:06.319" style="s2">congrats right and it can be very</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.559" end="00:49:07.359" style="s2">convincing the thing i always tell my</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.319" end="00:49:08.240" style="s2">students is um</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.359" end="00:49:09.680" style="s2">if you think you&#39;ve reached</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.240" end="00:49:10.559" style="s2">enlightenment spend the weekend with</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.680" end="00:49:13.839" style="s2">your family</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.559" end="00:49:18.319" style="s2">yep ramdas yup right</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.839" end="00:49:21.599" style="s2">yes ramdas that&#39;s right yeah so um</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.319" end="00:49:24.319" style="s2">you know cause like nothing lances that</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.599" end="00:49:28.400" style="s2">faster than having your old horseshit</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.319" end="00:49:28.400" style="s2">adolescent complexes rage all over the</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.599" end="00:49:33.440" style="s2">about place myth of icarus is that the</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.079" end="00:49:36.400" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.440" end="00:49:38.240" style="s2">like where people default so it feels</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.400" end="00:49:39.599" style="s2">like when the psyche hits an obstacle in</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.240" end="00:49:41.520" style="s2">life if it doesn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.599" end="00:49:43.040" style="s2">actually contend with being transformed</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.520" end="00:49:44.960" style="s2">by the obstacle the two things that</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.040" end="00:49:47.520" style="s2">we&#39;ll tend to do is either inflate</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.960" end="00:49:49.520" style="s2">or try to depress below it and icarus</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.520" end="00:49:52.559" style="s2">feels like the perfect example like</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.520" end="00:49:53.839" style="s2">a lot of people will destroy themselves</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.559" end="00:49:56.480" style="s2">through false stories</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.839" end="00:49:57.599" style="s2">so they don&#39;t even begin to contend with</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.480" end="00:49:59.040" style="s2">transformation</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.599" end="00:50:01.359" style="s2">and then other people will try to</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.040" end="00:50:03.520" style="s2">inflate above it so they again do not</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.359" end="00:50:05.359" style="s2">have to contend with transformation</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.520" end="00:50:07.200" style="s2">and you know that brings us full circle</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.359" end="00:50:09.520" style="s2">i think that that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.200" end="00:50:12.079" style="s2">why the hero&#39;s journey when looked at as</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.520" end="00:50:14.240" style="s2">an archetypical map to guide you to</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.079" end="00:50:16.720" style="s2">transforming the ego and the presence of</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.240" end="00:50:20.000" style="s2">what the self calls you to face</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.720" end="00:50:21.680" style="s2">seems to be the most useful guide map as</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.000" end="00:50:24.720" style="s2">you know a quote unquote coach that i</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.680" end="00:50:26.559" style="s2">have found so far in my life</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.720" end="00:50:28.559" style="s2">yeah i think i think you&#39;ve really got</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.559" end="00:50:31.680" style="s2">something there like</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.559" end="00:50:33.280" style="s2">um you know the the idea is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.680" end="00:50:35.599" style="s2">trying to fly this middle ground and</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.280" end="00:50:38.079" style="s2">it&#39;s like there are rules to some extent</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.599" end="00:50:39.440" style="s2">i you know there aren&#39;t really but there</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.079" end="00:50:41.920" style="s2">sort of are</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.440" end="00:50:43.200" style="s2">and right and that in and of itself is</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.920" end="00:50:45.359" style="s2">confusing as hell</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.200" end="00:50:46.240" style="s2">and so people&#39;s responses are they dive</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.359" end="00:50:48.000" style="s2">too low</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.240" end="00:50:49.520" style="s2">and then they say there are rules and</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.000" end="00:50:52.240" style="s2">these are the rules and i know</p>

<p begin="00:50:52.240" end="00:50:58.640" style="s2">i&#39;d rather be certain and wrong</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.599" end="00:51:01.040" style="s2">than than to bother to</p>

<p begin="00:51:01.040" end="00:51:05.440" style="s2">lies all kinds of things right i think</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.960" end="00:51:07.440" style="s2">in some ways like you know dogmatic</p>

<p begin="00:51:18.880" end="00:51:25.280" style="s2">um and just like you know whatever</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.079" end="00:51:26.160" style="s2">general absurdity uh so you know that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:51:26.160" end="00:51:30.160" style="s2">and if you want to go high what do you</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.599" end="00:51:33.839" style="s2">do you puff yourself up real far and say</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.160" end="00:51:36.240" style="s2">well luckily rules don&#39;t apply to me</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.839" end="00:51:37.359" style="s2">i transcend the rules through my very</p>

<p begin="00:51:40.079" end="00:51:44.400" style="s2">got something to them</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.359" end="00:51:46.960" style="s2">yeah right but divorced from each other</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.400" end="00:51:47.520" style="s2">you know it&#39;s a nightmare um you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.960" end="00:51:50.720" style="s2">it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.520" end="00:51:51.440" style="s2">it&#39;s a nightmare so and then you end up</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.720" end="00:51:54.000" style="s2">in the drink</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.440" end="00:51:55.760" style="s2">no matter what you do it&#39;s not so bad to</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.000" end="00:51:56.960" style="s2">go in the drink to be fair</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.760" end="00:51:59.200" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the whole bottom half of</p>

<p begin="00:51:59.200" end="00:52:08.960" style="s2">yeah yeah so i&#39;m hearing a lot of the um</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.359" end="00:52:12.319" style="s2">the ongoing need to learn how to make uh</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.960" end="00:52:14.640" style="s2">boats we can sail in in this time</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.319" end="00:52:16.000" style="s2">you know now maybe boats aren&#39;t getting</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.640" end="00:52:17.760" style="s2">off the air there so it needs to be some</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.000" end="00:52:19.359" style="s2">sort of hovercraft just to like stick</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.760" end="00:52:21.839" style="s2">with the icarus thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.359" end="00:52:23.440" style="s2">oh boats are going to come back yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.839" end="00:52:26.400" style="s2">yeah yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.440" end="00:52:26.400" style="s2">sailboats are awesome</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.720" end="00:52:34.960" style="s2">yeah yeah it seems um</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.040" end="00:52:37.200" style="s2">yeah something i&#39;m increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.960" end="00:52:40.079" style="s2">fascinated by is the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.200" end="00:52:41.200" style="s2">as i mentioned earlier the what you</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.079" end="00:52:44.319" style="s2">might call the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.200" end="00:52:47.440" style="s2">archetypes of what enables optimal</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.319" end="00:52:49.359" style="s2">or at least good generativity in</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.440" end="00:52:51.200" style="s2">conversation we might just say like what</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.359" end="00:52:53.520" style="s2">makes for a good group of friends even</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.200" end="00:52:54.480" style="s2">what makes that&#39;s actually adapting to</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.520" end="00:52:58.160" style="s2">an environment</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.480" end="00:52:59.680" style="s2">you know able to build and</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.160" end="00:53:01.280" style="s2">essentially take care of what needs to</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.680" end="00:53:05.200" style="s2">be taken care of</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.280" end="00:53:07.760" style="s2">um as they all become</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.200" end="00:53:09.200" style="s2">who they are you know this notion of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.760" end="00:53:12.319" style="s2">self that calls that</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.200" end="00:53:16.240" style="s2">you speak to eric um</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.319" end="00:53:18.800" style="s2">i often sense that the</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.240" end="00:53:19.520" style="s2">process of individuation in jung and i</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.800" end="00:53:23.280" style="s2">haven&#39;t read</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.520" end="00:53:27.200" style="s2">enough to be um to be sure of this</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.280" end="00:53:28.640" style="s2">but um some sort of concern that i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.200" end="00:53:31.760" style="s2">developed</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.640" end="00:53:35.520" style="s2">um particularly as well</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.760" end="00:53:36.960" style="s2">sort of analyzing or observing the</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.520" end="00:53:40.640" style="s2">jordan peterson phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.960" end="00:53:41.440" style="s2">and how he addresses just just that</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.640" end="00:53:43.920" style="s2">whole</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.440" end="00:53:45.760" style="s2">that whole journey on ongoing journey</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.920" end="00:53:48.960" style="s2">and what that ended up</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.760" end="00:53:51.040" style="s2">crystallizing in terms of a message</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.960" end="00:53:52.200" style="s2">in terms of individual responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.040" end="00:53:54.800" style="s2">and um</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.200" end="00:53:56.079" style="s2">self-authorship fundamentally which is</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.800" end="00:53:57.839" style="s2">the fourth stage in</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.079" end="00:53:59.520" style="s2">keegan&#39;s developmental model the fifth</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.839" end="00:54:01.359" style="s2">being um</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.520" end="00:54:03.680" style="s2">something beyond self-authoring i forget</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.359" end="00:54:05.599" style="s2">the exact name he gives to it do you</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.680" end="00:54:06.920" style="s2">do you recall that it&#39;s it&#39;s it anyway</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.599" end="00:54:08.640" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s like it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.920" end="00:54:10.640" style="s2">trans-paradigmatic thing it&#39;s like an</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.640" end="00:54:12.480" style="s2">inter it&#39;s like an interdependency the</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.640" end="00:54:16.000" style="s2">recognition of interdependency</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.480" end="00:54:19.440" style="s2">so beyond self-authorship how</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.000" end="00:54:20.000" style="s2">can we become together um what we need</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.440" end="00:54:21.760" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.000" end="00:54:23.280" style="s2">so that there&#39;s this concept of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.760" end="00:54:24.960" style="s2">lookout that i really like that a guy</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.280" end="00:54:25.520" style="s2">called tyson yonko porter speaks about</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.960" end="00:54:27.839" style="s2">in his book</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.520" end="00:54:29.760" style="s2">sound talk but basically it&#39;s an in</p>

<p begin="00:54:29.760" end="00:54:34.640" style="s2">i used to something similar came to me</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.800" end="00:54:36.160" style="s2">after a dmt experience once</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.640" end="00:54:38.160" style="s2">to do with the importance of</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.160" end="00:54:39.119" style="s2">appreciating the beauty around me but</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.160" end="00:54:41.200" style="s2">also to push</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.119" end="00:54:42.640" style="s2">just beyond it appropriately just to</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.200" end="00:54:45.680" style="s2">advance the station</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.640" end="00:54:47.599" style="s2">my station but only after i&#39;d um really</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.680" end="00:54:48.880" style="s2">come to appreciate exactly where i was</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.599" end="00:54:52.000" style="s2">in some sense and so</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.880" end="00:54:54.319" style="s2">the lookout is something like okay so</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.000" end="00:54:55.119" style="s2">what of this domain of complexity this</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.319" end="00:54:58.400" style="s2">domain</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.119" end="00:55:00.720" style="s2">that i&#39;m um custodian for</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.400" end="00:55:02.880" style="s2">um what is mine to be in this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.720" end="00:55:04.640" style="s2">caring reciprocal relationship with and</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.880" end="00:55:05.760" style="s2">what is someone else&#39;s and how we all</p>

<p begin="00:55:05.760" end="00:55:10.480" style="s2">together tend to the ecology which is</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.839" end="00:55:12.480" style="s2">supporting us all and enabling us all to</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.480" end="00:55:14.559" style="s2">sort of individuate in some sense the</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.480" end="00:55:18.079" style="s2">one thing as an interdependent</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.559" end="00:55:21.839" style="s2">prosecutor cycle of becoming or</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.079" end="00:55:21.839" style="s2">a certain sort of transformation</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.160" end="00:55:28.480" style="s2">and this notion of the self in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.760" end="00:55:30.319" style="s2">jungian sense</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.480" end="00:55:31.760" style="s2">often i think i think when people relate</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.319" end="00:55:33.920" style="s2">to it certainly i did</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.760" end="00:55:34.960" style="s2">when i was first encountering the ideas</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.920" end="00:55:37.599" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.960" end="00:55:39.200" style="s2">i think i saw it as something perhaps a</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.599" end="00:55:41.119" style="s2">little bit too isolated</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.200" end="00:55:42.960" style="s2">interpreting it from the self-authorship</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.119" end="00:55:46.400" style="s2">point of view where it was though</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.960" end="00:55:48.960" style="s2">there was something for me to become</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.400" end="00:55:50.799" style="s2">um in a way that maybe didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.960" end="00:55:54.319" style="s2">necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.799" end="00:55:55.920" style="s2">take into account the the the need for</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.319" end="00:55:59.760" style="s2">that to be part of let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.920" end="00:56:00.559" style="s2">a tribe and to be part of a contributing</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.760" end="00:56:03.359" style="s2">element</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.559" end="00:56:04.480" style="s2">to that which was the eternal creation</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.359" end="00:56:05.839" style="s2">of the context</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.480" end="00:56:09.040" style="s2">which actually has to be there in order</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.839" end="00:56:11.760" style="s2">for me to be who i need to be anyway</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.040" end="00:56:13.920" style="s2">um and so i&#39;m wondering if if if it</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.760" end="00:56:14.799" style="s2">makes sense to extend the notion of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.920" end="00:56:16.559" style="s2">self or if you</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.799" end="00:56:18.400" style="s2">already incorporates this into a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.559" end="00:56:21.520" style="s2">understanding well i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.400" end="00:56:23.599" style="s2">but how i relate to this kind of um how</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.520" end="00:56:25.280" style="s2">i relate to this sun in the solar system</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.599" end="00:56:27.119" style="s2">of the self as this thing which</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.280" end="00:56:29.040" style="s2">projects its light and sort of cools to</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.119" end="00:56:30.400" style="s2">me it&#39;s both an ember and an echo in</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.040" end="00:56:33.200" style="s2">some sense</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.400" end="00:56:34.799" style="s2">that acorn like nature but also the echo</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.200" end="00:56:36.400" style="s2">back of its projection of what it can</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.799" end="00:56:39.760" style="s2">become</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.400" end="00:56:41.920" style="s2">is that it&#39;s a kind of it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.760" end="00:56:42.960" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a moving center like the</p>

<p begin="00:56:42.960" end="00:56:48.720" style="s2">in each of us the ember is um</p>

<p begin="00:56:48.720" end="00:56:52.240" style="s2">that sense and we each are responsible</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.799" end="00:56:54.160" style="s2">for our appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.240" end="00:56:55.839" style="s2">portions of the fabric and we switch</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.160" end="00:56:57.200" style="s2">sides and we have different roles and</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.839" end="00:57:00.720" style="s2">all the rest of it</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.200" end="00:57:04.240" style="s2">but we take responsibility for the</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.720" end="00:57:08.000" style="s2">different sort of niches which together</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.240" end="00:57:10.400" style="s2">constitute this interdependent ecology</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.000" end="00:57:11.760" style="s2">and all of that in some sense itself</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.400" end="00:57:13.520" style="s2">from the sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.760" end="00:57:15.119" style="s2">from a sense of monism from a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.520" end="00:57:18.319" style="s2">we&#39;re all connected man</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.119" end="00:57:20.400" style="s2">this ongoing recreation</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.319" end="00:57:21.760" style="s2">um and there&#39;s something inherently</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.400" end="00:57:24.880" style="s2">transactive about that</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.760" end="00:57:26.240" style="s2">i&#39;m just wondering if if there can be a</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.880" end="00:57:27.599" style="s2">critique made of young and i&#39;m not the</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.240" end="00:57:28.559" style="s2">one to make it because i can&#39;t speak to</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.599" end="00:57:30.240" style="s2">what the man</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.559" end="00:57:30.960" style="s2">truly finally really said there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.240" end="00:57:32.000" style="s2">obviously lots of different</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.960" end="00:57:33.680" style="s2">interpretations</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.000" end="00:57:36.480" style="s2">but is there a critique to be made of</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.680" end="00:57:39.440" style="s2">jung that in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.480" end="00:57:41.359" style="s2">the individual&#39;s relationship to the</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.440" end="00:57:43.200" style="s2">collective unconscious even</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.359" end="00:57:44.720" style="s2">was altogether perhaps a little bit too</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.200" end="00:57:47.880" style="s2">individual and</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.720" end="00:57:50.240" style="s2">not enough of a truly involved</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.880" end="00:57:52.240" style="s2">participatory remaking of that very</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.240" end="00:57:53.040" style="s2">fabric of the collective unconscious if</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.240" end="00:57:56.880" style="s2">you can</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.040" end="00:57:56.880" style="s2">kind of see what i&#39;m trying to gesture</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.400" end="00:58:07.680" style="s2">yeah i mean so it&#39;s almost tricky</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.319" end="00:58:08.480" style="s2">right because young is writing over half</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.680" end="00:58:12.000" style="s2">a century</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.480" end="00:58:14.000" style="s2">and his ideas are changing and</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.000" end="00:58:15.359" style="s2">you know when you&#39;re sort of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.000" end="00:58:16.640" style="s2">teach this material it&#39;s always tricky</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.359" end="00:58:18.160" style="s2">because people like well he says this</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.640" end="00:58:21.280" style="s2">here but he says this here</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.160" end="00:58:23.040" style="s2">and it&#39;s like yep it&#39;s true that&#39;s those</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.280" end="00:58:24.079" style="s2">are two different things that he said 25</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.040" end="00:58:26.400" style="s2">years apart</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.079" end="00:58:27.440" style="s2">so you should get to work on reconciling</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.400" end="00:58:30.720" style="s2">those things</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.440" end="00:58:30.720" style="s2">um you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.359" end="00:58:35.440" style="s2">one of the yeah i mean no i think i</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.440" end="00:58:38.079" style="s2">think you&#39;re right in some ways right</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.440" end="00:58:39.680" style="s2">jung is speaking to some extent and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.079" end="00:58:41.680" style="s2">an earlier version of it but out of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.680" end="00:58:44.720" style="s2">framework of like</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.680" end="00:58:47.520" style="s2">you know western individualism</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.720" end="00:58:48.880" style="s2">and that kind of like atomized vision of</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.520" end="00:58:52.400" style="s2">the individual i mean you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.880" end="00:58:54.240" style="s2">individuation even typically as a term</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.400" end="00:58:56.160" style="s2">more often than not triggers people</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.240" end="00:58:57.839" style="s2">sense that they&#39;re going to become</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.160" end="00:58:59.520" style="s2">you know an individual right like a</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.839" end="00:59:02.319" style="s2">radical monad</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.520" end="00:59:03.760" style="s2">you know highly unified and you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.319" end="00:59:05.440" style="s2">it&#39;s only it&#39;s only when</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.760" end="00:59:06.640" style="s2">you kind of get into the concept that</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.440" end="00:59:07.920" style="s2">you&#39;re pointing out that it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.640" end="00:59:09.119" style="s2">not that simple</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.920" end="00:59:11.280" style="s2">you&#39;re in fact you&#39;re becoming highly</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.119" end="00:59:12.400" style="s2">individual you are shedding yourself of</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.280" end="00:59:15.440" style="s2">your idea that you are</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.400" end="00:59:18.000" style="s2">unitive um and and then</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.440" end="00:59:19.920" style="s2">you are undergoing something that yes</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.000" end="00:59:23.280" style="s2">involves integration but not just</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.920" end="00:59:25.599" style="s2">integration it involves integration</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.280" end="00:59:26.720" style="s2">and dissociation repeatedly between</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.599" end="00:59:30.079" style="s2">different parts</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.720" end="00:59:33.280" style="s2">to form a far more complex and dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.079" end="00:59:34.160" style="s2">inner community right i think takes it</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.280" end="00:59:35.920" style="s2">for granted</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.160" end="00:59:37.520" style="s2">in some sense that there is an outer</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.920" end="00:59:41.119" style="s2">community because</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.520" end="00:59:44.240" style="s2">you know from 1910 through to 1960</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.119" end="00:59:46.799" style="s2">those things were still if not perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.240" end="00:59:49.440" style="s2">intact more in intact than they are now</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.799" end="00:59:51.040" style="s2">right there were still bowling leagues</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.440" end="00:59:53.680" style="s2">and church picnics</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.040" end="00:59:55.200" style="s2">and like right thing the sorts of things</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.680" end="00:59:57.680" style="s2">that people used to</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.200" end="00:59:59.359" style="s2">to have community structures at large</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.680" end="01:00:01.200" style="s2">now at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.359" end="01:00:03.359" style="s2">you know one of the things the self</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.200" end="01:00:06.400" style="s2">pretty notoriously calls people to do is</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.359" end="01:00:08.559" style="s2">separate themselves from the tribe right</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.400" end="01:00:09.520" style="s2">and to to to walk into the desert to go</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.559" end="01:00:12.000" style="s2">into the cave</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.520" end="01:00:13.760" style="s2">to put oneself into the monastery like</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.000" end="01:00:15.359" style="s2">sometimes separating oneself out but</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.760" end="01:00:18.640" style="s2">it&#39;s the same thing it&#39;s integration</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.359" end="01:00:20.960" style="s2">dissociation and you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.640" end="01:00:21.920" style="s2">one of the most powerful experiences i i</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.960" end="01:00:24.720" style="s2">had</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.920" end="01:00:26.319" style="s2">in my life for sure um as an experience</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.720" end="01:00:29.599" style="s2">of the self was</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.319" end="01:00:30.400" style="s2">um during my kind of uh second and and</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.599" end="01:00:34.160" style="s2">quite powerful</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.400" end="01:00:37.680" style="s2">uh iboga experience and</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.160" end="01:00:39.599" style="s2">i had primed myself for the idea of i</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.680" end="01:00:40.880" style="s2">was doing some some kabbalistic work so</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.599" end="01:00:43.040" style="s2">it won&#39;t get too deep but</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.880" end="01:00:44.480" style="s2">i was combining a boga with kabbalah and</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.040" end="01:00:47.520" style="s2">i was planning to ascend to</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.480" end="01:00:48.640" style="s2">teferet the solar sphere okay and the</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.520" end="01:00:50.799" style="s2">idea was i would</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.640" end="01:00:52.000" style="s2">encounter the resurrecting gods right</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.799" end="01:00:54.720" style="s2">these are your gods that come back to</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.000" end="01:00:56.319" style="s2">life you&#39;d think being raised christian</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.720" end="01:00:58.880" style="s2">that the god i might encounter would be</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.319" end="01:01:01.280" style="s2">you know jesus or maybe a mithra</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.880" end="01:01:02.000" style="s2">or something you know uh but when i</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.280" end="01:01:05.040" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.000" end="01:01:06.559" style="s2">sort of got to this space this radiant</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.040" end="01:01:09.359" style="s2">golden</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.559" end="01:01:11.200" style="s2">space and the psyche as it were um i</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.359" end="01:01:14.079" style="s2">encountered superman</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.200" end="01:01:15.680" style="s2">this surprised me tremendously i love it</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.079" end="01:01:17.920" style="s2">um i mean it makes much more sense</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.680" end="01:01:19.920" style="s2">that would have had a far more basic</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.920" end="01:01:20.400" style="s2">impact on me and i could go on about</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.920" end="01:01:22.000" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.400" end="01:01:23.599" style="s2">but the point is i encountered superman</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.000" end="01:01:25.359" style="s2">who had this dialogue with superman</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.599" end="01:01:27.040" style="s2">and one of the things that came out of</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.359" end="01:01:29.599" style="s2">that as things that have come out with</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.040" end="01:01:31.040" style="s2">some of these other experiences that</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.599" end="01:01:32.960" style="s2">were in some cases</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.040" end="01:01:34.400" style="s2">based in altered states that were sort</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.960" end="01:01:36.319" style="s2">of exogenous</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.400" end="01:01:38.240" style="s2">in some way and in some cases fully</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.319" end="01:01:39.520" style="s2">endogenous right these</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.240" end="01:01:41.839" style="s2">these things that broke through the</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.520" end="01:01:44.319" style="s2">bottom of the bucket um</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.839" end="01:01:46.240" style="s2">was that very often what these things</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.319" end="01:01:48.240" style="s2">did when i connected with this was that</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.240" end="01:01:49.440" style="s2">yes sometimes it would sort of drive me</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.240" end="01:01:51.359" style="s2">into the wilderness</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.440" end="01:01:52.799" style="s2">but a lot of the time and certainly with</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.359" end="01:01:55.039" style="s2">this one with superman and with some of</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.799" end="01:01:56.720" style="s2">those experiences it was like</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.039" end="01:01:58.880" style="s2">okay now it&#39;s time to go back to</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.720" end="01:02:00.000" style="s2">civilization like it&#39;s time to rejoin</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.880" end="01:02:02.240" style="s2">the tribe</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.000" end="01:02:03.119" style="s2">so and i think that&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.240" end="01:02:05.520" style="s2">iboga</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.119" end="01:02:07.280" style="s2">and ayahuasca both my experience with a</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.520" end="01:02:09.200" style="s2">boga more so than ayahuasca</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.280" end="01:02:10.799" style="s2">ayahuasca when i asked it about my human</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.200" end="01:02:13.839" style="s2">relationships was like</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.799" end="01:02:17.119" style="s2">no that doesn&#39;t matter here are 19 neon</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.839" end="01:02:20.240" style="s2">jaguar gods um that was my experience</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.119" end="01:02:20.640" style="s2">but boga was very concerned with ground</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.240" end="01:02:23.039" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.640" end="01:02:24.079" style="s2">human ties right right and to whatever</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.039" end="01:02:25.599" style="s2">extent and i think</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.079" end="01:02:27.760" style="s2">you know it&#39;s reasonable to think of</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.599" end="01:02:29.680" style="s2">those things as legitimate</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.760" end="01:02:31.920" style="s2">um sort of mystical experiences and</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.680" end="01:02:32.319" style="s2">connections i think that they have this</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.920" end="01:02:36.559" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.319" end="01:02:39.680" style="s2">of pulling people back to community</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.559" end="01:02:41.440" style="s2">when that&#39;s what&#39;s needed and that it</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.680" end="01:02:42.880" style="s2">in some sense mirrors and reflects and</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.440" end="01:02:44.480" style="s2">that&#39;s the union idea your inner</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.880" end="01:02:47.280" style="s2">community and your outer community</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.480" end="01:02:49.760" style="s2">right exactly it&#39;s all transactive right</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.280" end="01:02:53.119" style="s2">um that&#39;s why we project onto people and</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.760" end="01:02:54.160" style="s2">so you know um so i&#39;m gonna have to go</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.119" end="01:02:56.240" style="s2">after this but</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.160" end="01:02:57.599" style="s2">but the thing that comes up in response</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.240" end="01:03:02.240" style="s2">to your question</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.599" end="01:03:03.920" style="s2">is that um so my understanding is that</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.240" end="01:03:05.280" style="s2">one of jung&#39;s favorite stories at the</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.920" end="01:03:07.200" style="s2">end of his life was the</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.280" end="01:03:09.359" style="s2">rainmaker story and i think the</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.200" end="01:03:10.079" style="s2">rainmaker story perfectly answers this</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.359" end="01:03:13.200" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.079" end="01:03:14.000" style="s2">and so in brief the story is his friend</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.200" end="01:03:15.599" style="s2">is in china</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.000" end="01:03:17.280" style="s2">is at a village and the village is going</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.599" end="01:03:19.280" style="s2">through a drought and</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.280" end="01:03:20.880" style="s2">the westerner you know who sees the</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.280" end="01:03:23.359" style="s2">world through the western lens</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.880" end="01:03:24.559" style="s2">is wondering like what the town&#39;s people</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.359" end="01:03:25.920" style="s2">or what the village people are going to</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.559" end="01:03:27.920" style="s2">do about this drought</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.920" end="01:03:29.680" style="s2">and the people tell them don&#39;t worry</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.920" end="01:03:32.480" style="s2">we&#39;re waiting on the rainmaker</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.680" end="01:03:33.760" style="s2">and this westerner is like you know what</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.480" end="01:03:35.520" style="s2">the hell is a rainmaker</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.760" end="01:03:37.680" style="s2">and this old man eventually comes to the</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.520" end="01:03:39.599" style="s2">village and the town or the village</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.680" end="01:03:41.119" style="s2">people go to him and they take him to</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.599" end="01:03:43.039" style="s2">a hut at the edge of the village and</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.119" end="01:03:44.880" style="s2">they put him in the hut and the</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.039" end="01:03:46.240" style="s2">westerner watches is that he stays in</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.880" end="01:03:47.680" style="s2">this hut for three days</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.240" end="01:03:50.160" style="s2">and then at the end of the third day it</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.680" end="01:03:51.760" style="s2">starts raining and the rainmaker emerges</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.160" end="01:03:53.680" style="s2">out of the hut and the westerner goes up</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.760" end="01:03:55.920" style="s2">to him and he asks him what did you do</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.680" end="01:03:57.440" style="s2">how did you do this and the rainmaker</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.920" end="01:03:59.599" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.440" end="01:04:01.359" style="s2">i come from a place where the land is in</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.599" end="01:04:03.520" style="s2">order and because the land</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.359" end="01:04:05.680" style="s2">is in order the land does what it must</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.520" end="01:04:08.000" style="s2">do when i came to this place the land</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.680" end="01:04:10.000" style="s2">was out of order and i got infected</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.000" end="01:04:12.079" style="s2">so i had to go put myself in order and</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.000" end="01:04:13.680" style="s2">once i put myself in order the land</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.079" end="01:04:16.319" style="s2">came into order and the land did what it</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.680" end="01:04:16.640" style="s2">had to do and my understanding of that</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.319" end="01:04:18.799" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.640" end="01:04:19.680" style="s2">in this embodies what the individuation</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.799" end="01:04:23.039" style="s2">process is</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.680" end="01:04:25.280" style="s2">and it&#39;s that you have to get away</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.039" end="01:04:26.240" style="s2">in order to come into order with</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.280" end="01:04:28.559" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.240" end="01:04:30.480" style="s2">and then the natural byproduct of being</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.559" end="01:04:32.720" style="s2">in order in yourself is you bring that</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.480" end="01:04:33.760" style="s2">order to the environment and improve the</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.720" end="01:04:36.559" style="s2">environment</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.760" end="01:04:38.880" style="s2">and that it will always bring you back</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.559" end="01:04:41.839" style="s2">to the community</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.880" end="01:04:41.839" style="s2">perfect</p>
