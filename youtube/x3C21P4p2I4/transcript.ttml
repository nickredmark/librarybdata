<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:03.270" style="s2">I started to make sense of a lot of what</p>
<p begin="00:00:01.770" end="00:00:05.790" style="s2">I&#39;ve been doing over the last few years</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.270" end="00:00:07.680" style="s2">I&#39;ve done quite a lot of sort of deep</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.790" end="00:00:09.179" style="s2">transformational practices a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.680" end="00:00:11.969" style="s2">shadow work so integrating the shadow</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.179" end="00:00:13.469" style="s2">and actually feeling that real sense of</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.969" end="00:00:15.269" style="s2">becoming more in alignment with myself</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.469" end="00:00:16.770" style="s2">but it was through listening to you that</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.269" end="00:00:18.570" style="s2">I made this connection with the logos</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.770" end="00:00:20.490" style="s2">with the idea that this is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.570" end="00:00:22.980" style="s2">deep principle of Western culture which</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.490" end="00:00:25.949" style="s2">gave it another it&#39;s it&#39;s the principle</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.980" end="00:00:29.970" style="s2">of the Incarnation right because the</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.949" end="00:00:31.890" style="s2">Incarnation is is as at least a symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.970" end="00:00:33.800" style="s2">representation of the idea that the</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.890" end="00:00:36.809" style="s2">Spirit has to fully inhabit the body</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.800" end="00:00:38.670" style="s2">right and that&#39;s also a remarkable it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.809" end="00:00:41.340" style="s2">a remarkable idea especially because the</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.670" end="00:00:43.980" style="s2">spirit so to speak the psyche if you</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.340" end="00:00:46.309" style="s2">want flees from the body and terror</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.980" end="00:00:48.989" style="s2">because the body is the place of</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.309" end="00:00:51.300" style="s2">mortality and suffering and so people</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.989" end="00:00:52.680" style="s2">are disembodied and it&#39;s because what</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.300" end="00:00:54.989" style="s2">one way of looking at is because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.680" end="00:00:57.870" style="s2">too afraid to become fully embodied and</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.989" end="00:01:01.289" style="s2">it&#39;s no wonder they&#39;re afraid there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.870" end="00:01:02.730" style="s2">reason to be afraid but the question is</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.289" end="00:01:04.920" style="s2">well what would you be like if you had</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.730" end="00:01:06.540" style="s2">the courage to be fully embodied and</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.920" end="00:01:08.580" style="s2">that&#39;s fully incarnate that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.540" end="00:01:10.350" style="s2">way of thinking about that and the idea</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.580" end="00:01:13.320" style="s2">that Christian idea is that the fully</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.350" end="00:01:16.619" style="s2">incarnate human being is the Messiah</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.320" end="00:01:20.549" style="s2">that&#39;s the idea that&#39;s a hell of an idea</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.619" end="00:01:22.740" style="s2">you know but it means embracing the</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.549" end="00:01:26.369" style="s2">horrors of the world that&#39;s what it</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.740" end="00:01:28.080" style="s2">means and that&#39;s not only the horrors of</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.369" end="00:01:31.310" style="s2">the world but the evil of the world you</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.080" end="00:01:33.810" style="s2">know so there&#39;s this idea that Christ</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.310" end="00:01:36.390" style="s2">absolutely well then those are those are</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.810" end="00:01:38.670" style="s2">not different and you know there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.390" end="00:01:40.590" style="s2">idea that not only was Christ the</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.670" end="00:01:43.079" style="s2">Incarnate spirit right so fully</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.590" end="00:01:44.579" style="s2">descended into the body let&#39;s say but</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.079" end="00:01:47.420" style="s2">that he also took the sins of the world</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.579" end="00:01:50.759" style="s2">onto himself and what that means is that</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.420" end="00:01:52.920" style="s2">psychologically speaking is that part of</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.759" end="00:01:55.950" style="s2">spiritual development is to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.920" end="00:02:00.899" style="s2">the satanic tendencies that characterize</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.950" end="00:02:02.939" style="s2">you and to fully wrestle with them and</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.899" end="00:02:04.740" style="s2">to and to integrate them that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.939" end="00:02:07.829" style="s2">thing it&#39;s it&#39;s not so much to cast them</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.740" end="00:02:09.390" style="s2">away it&#39;s to transmute them you know and</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.829" end="00:02:11.099" style="s2">you can see the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.390" end="00:02:13.400" style="s2">people who&#39;ve done that and people who</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.099" end="00:02:15.709" style="s2">haven&#39;t at least to some degree because</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.400" end="00:02:18.290" style="s2">people who haven&#39;t integrated the shadow</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.709" end="00:02:20.390" style="s2">at all are naive and you can tell that</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.290" end="00:02:22.400" style="s2">when you look at them and you can tell</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.390" end="00:02:23.989" style="s2">that when you talk to them and because</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.400" end="00:02:25.700" style="s2">they&#39;re naive they&#39;re often resentful as</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.989" end="00:02:27.920" style="s2">well because they get taken advantage of</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.700" end="00:02:31.370" style="s2">it and someone who&#39;s integrated that</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.920" end="00:02:32.870" style="s2">more they&#39;re dangerous in in the martial</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.370" end="00:02:35.239" style="s2">arts sort of way which is they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.870" end="00:02:37.840" style="s2">dangerous but they don&#39;t have to be they</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.239" end="00:02:37.840" style="s2">don&#39;t have to use it</p>
