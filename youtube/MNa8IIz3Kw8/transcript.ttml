<p begin="00:00:00.220" end="00:00:08.559" style="s2">so recently it turned out that there was</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.080" end="00:00:11.829" style="s2">a pretty meaningful response to a short</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.559" end="00:00:15.879" style="s2">video that someone shot and Tom the</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.829" end="00:00:17.440" style="s2">glitch in the matrix and well it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.879" end="00:00:18.940" style="s2">a lot easier to create a video than it</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.440" end="00:00:20.550" style="s2">is to try to write things down in a</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.940" end="00:00:23.050" style="s2">medium post so I thought I might try</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.550" end="00:00:27.700" style="s2">creating a series of short videos and</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.050" end="00:00:30.580" style="s2">see if there&#39;s any real interest most</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.700" end="00:00:31.539" style="s2">likely the viewership of that video was</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.580" end="00:00:33.999" style="s2">actually generated by the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.539" end="00:00:35.350" style="s2">Jordan Peterson tweeted it so most</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.999" end="00:00:38.620" style="s2">likely nobody will actually watch these</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.350" end="00:00:39.789" style="s2">videos but if some people do and if it</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.620" end="00:00:45.969" style="s2">has some value than it was worth doing</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.789" end="00:00:47.890" style="s2">so here we go as an experiment the first</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.969" end="00:00:49.300" style="s2">video I thought I might want to play</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.890" end="00:00:52.929" style="s2">with an idea it&#39;s actually kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.300" end="00:00:54.159" style="s2">difficult to to explain in writing but</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.929" end="00:00:59.769" style="s2">it might actually be pretty easy to</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.159" end="00:01:01.239" style="s2">explain in in video and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.769" end="00:01:03.069" style="s2">it&#39;s not common currants and I think is</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.239" end="00:01:06.040" style="s2">pretty helpful so the idea is to say</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.069" end="00:01:08.470" style="s2">that there is say in a social</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.040" end="00:01:10.210" style="s2">environment we can we can imagine a</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.470" end="00:01:12.270" style="s2">couple of different layers and this is</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.210" end="00:01:14.920" style="s2">just a useful way of partitioning</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.270" end="00:01:15.910" style="s2">certain kind of social phenomenon so we</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.920" end="00:01:18.520" style="s2">might say for example there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.910" end="00:01:21.310" style="s2">financial layer that is about the way</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.520" end="00:01:23.800" style="s2">that money flows and agreements around</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.310" end="00:01:27.850" style="s2">money works there&#39;s an economic layer</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.800" end="00:01:30.100" style="s2">which is about physical infrastructure</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.850" end="00:01:32.050" style="s2">about skills about the distribution and</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.100" end="00:01:34.060" style="s2">resources and where people are working</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.050" end="00:01:36.850" style="s2">and things like that there is the</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.060" end="00:01:39.130" style="s2">socio-political layer which is things</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.850" end="00:01:41.890" style="s2">like but the effectiveness the</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.130" end="00:01:43.360" style="s2">legitimacy trust in various kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.890" end="00:01:45.430" style="s2">social institutions including schools</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.360" end="00:01:47.290" style="s2">and government and things like that and</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.430" end="00:01:50.350" style="s2">then there&#39;s the the cultural layer</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.290" end="00:01:54.310" style="s2">which is kind of the degree to which</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.350" end="00:01:56.440" style="s2">people in a given society share values</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.310" end="00:01:59.830" style="s2">and most importantly consider each other</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.440" end="00:02:01.360" style="s2">to be inside some kind of cultural loop</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.830" end="00:02:04.420" style="s2">whereby they don&#39;t treat each other as</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.360" end="00:02:08.050" style="s2">either arms-length trading partners or</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.420" end="00:02:09.700" style="s2">even worse as potential enemies and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.050" end="00:02:12.040" style="s2">the first idea is that you can think</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.700" end="00:02:14.250" style="s2">about a social environment using those</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.040" end="00:02:17.500" style="s2">those layers and</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.250" end="00:02:19.150" style="s2">the second and in this case the more</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.500" end="00:02:20.770" style="s2">important point is to think about the</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.150" end="00:02:23.820" style="s2">way that the layers can actually be</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.770" end="00:02:27.820" style="s2">traded off against each other so</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.820" end="00:02:30.550" style="s2">specifically I quite specifically</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.820" end="00:02:33.910" style="s2">imagine what happened in 2008 during the</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.550" end="00:02:35.940" style="s2">2008 financial crisis that whether this</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.910" end="00:02:40.410" style="s2">is done consciously or unconsciously a</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.940" end="00:02:43.240" style="s2">decision was made to prevent or inhibit</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.410" end="00:02:45.850" style="s2">the negative consequences at the</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.240" end="00:02:48.790" style="s2">financial and to a lesser but very</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.850" end="00:02:51.730" style="s2">important extent economic layer by</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.790" end="00:02:54.010" style="s2">actually spending resources or burning</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.730" end="00:02:56.950" style="s2">resources at the social political and</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.010" end="00:02:58.900" style="s2">even at the cultural level right so you</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.950" end="00:03:01.600" style="s2">might imagine that roughly around the</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.900" end="00:03:03.190" style="s2">time that say for example tarp and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.600" end="00:03:05.830" style="s2">various bailout decisions were being</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.190" end="00:03:07.720" style="s2">made that it could have gone either way</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.830" end="00:03:10.450" style="s2">and that we could have for example</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.720" end="00:03:14.260" style="s2">allowed the too-big-to-fail entities to</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.450" end="00:03:15.790" style="s2">fail and this would have had negative</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.260" end="00:03:18.670" style="s2">consequences that sort of the financial</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.790" end="00:03:20.260" style="s2">level and negative consequences probably</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.670" end="00:03:21.790" style="s2">at the economic level and even negative</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.260" end="00:03:23.470" style="s2">consequences at the political level the</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.790" end="00:03:26.530" style="s2">people who&#39;ve had some you know as the</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.470" end="00:03:28.840" style="s2">pain of crashing market to that as the</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.530" end="00:03:30.640" style="s2">pain of unemployment got passed on to</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.840" end="00:03:32.170" style="s2">the people they would have probably been</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.640" end="00:03:35.560" style="s2">very unhappy at a political level of me</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.170" end="00:03:37.720" style="s2">if voted the rascals out however it</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.560" end="00:03:39.670" style="s2">would have kept it in that order right</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.720" end="00:03:41.350" style="s2">and so eventually as the negative</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.670" end="00:03:42.850" style="s2">consequences the financial crisis played</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.350" end="00:03:45.550" style="s2">its way out and say all the bank&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.850" end="00:03:48.310" style="s2">disappeared some kind of new approach</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.550" end="00:03:50.680" style="s2">say for example Google innovating an</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.310" end="00:03:53.350" style="s2">entirely novel way of handling banking</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.680" end="00:03:55.150" style="s2">questions or the emergence of an</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.350" end="00:03:57.310" style="s2">entirely different regime would have</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.150" end="00:03:59.459" style="s2">come into place and we would have moved</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.310" end="00:03:59.459" style="s2">forward</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.960" end="00:04:05.000" style="s2">effectively no damage being done at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.850" end="00:04:08.870" style="s2">cultural level instead a choice was made</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.000" end="00:04:13.150" style="s2">to save bail out the the too-big-to-fail</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.870" end="00:04:15.500" style="s2">entities protect the integrity of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.150" end="00:04:18.410" style="s2">financial system and the economic layer</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.500" end="00:04:20.989" style="s2">and modeled as we currently have it and</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.410" end="00:04:24.530" style="s2">I would propose that this was being this</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.989" end="00:04:27.650" style="s2">it was done at the cost of political</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.530" end="00:04:31.280" style="s2">particular and also at the cost of</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.650" end="00:04:34.730" style="s2">cultural capital so quite specifically</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.280" end="00:04:38.720" style="s2">what I would say is that things like the</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.730" end="00:04:42.650" style="s2">Trump phenomenon and brexit are directly</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.720" end="00:04:43.670" style="s2">and linearly connected to the various</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.650" end="00:04:45.740" style="s2">bailouts that happened in the United</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.670" end="00:04:47.300" style="s2">States in Europe but it was a Direct</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.740" end="00:04:49.400" style="s2">Subsidy the political and cultural layer</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.300" end="00:04:52.280" style="s2">subsidized the economic and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.400" end="00:04:57.140" style="s2">financial layer at cost to the political</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.280" end="00:04:59.330" style="s2">and cultural layer and so as an example</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.140" end="00:05:01.010" style="s2">of a similar historical circumstance you</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.330" end="00:05:02.830" style="s2">can take a look at what happened in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.010" end="00:05:06.020" style="s2">United States and in Germany in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.830" end="00:05:09.860" style="s2">context of the Great Depression in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.020" end="00:05:11.780" style="s2">1930s that in the United States the</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.860" end="00:05:13.700" style="s2">financial the depression hits the</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.780" end="00:05:14.900" style="s2">financial layer quite badly it burned</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.700" end="00:05:16.880" style="s2">down to the economic layer hit the</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.900" end="00:05:18.260" style="s2">economic layer quite badly it burned</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.880" end="00:05:20.360" style="s2">under the political layer which is to</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.260" end="00:05:22.850" style="s2">say that the Republicans were voted out</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.360" end="00:05:25.520" style="s2">and the Democrats were voted in and you</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.850" end="00:05:27.980" style="s2">had a meaningfully significant change to</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.520" end="00:05:29.750" style="s2">the nature of what American politics</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.980" end="00:05:32.420" style="s2">looked like vastly more centralization</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.750" end="00:05:34.040" style="s2">around the executive but it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.420" end="00:05:36.920" style="s2">meaningfully burn down to the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.040" end="00:05:39.620" style="s2">level and in many ways it actually made</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.920" end="00:05:42.290" style="s2">the cultural level stronger well by</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.620" end="00:05:44.360" style="s2">contrast in Germany the financial crisis</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.290" end="00:05:46.760" style="s2">went to hyper inflation which vaporized</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.360" end="00:05:48.550" style="s2">the entire financial system which</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.760" end="00:05:52.810" style="s2">hammered the economic system and led to</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.550" end="00:05:54.890" style="s2">a terrible terrible economic depression</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.810" end="00:05:56.450" style="s2">which in fact went all the way down to</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.890" end="00:05:58.000" style="s2">vaporize the political layer and led to</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.450" end="00:06:00.170" style="s2">the collapse of the Weimar Republic</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.000" end="00:06:02.120" style="s2">which then of course even penetrated</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.170" end="00:06:03.560" style="s2">into the cultural layer and led to</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.120" end="00:06:05.690" style="s2">things like the Holocaust where Germans</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.560" end="00:06:07.280" style="s2">turned against Germans and the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.690" end="00:06:10.310" style="s2">what it even meant to be part of a</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.280" end="00:06:14.960" style="s2">culture became problematised</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.310" end="00:06:17.480" style="s2">so so this is the framework and the the</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.960" end="00:06:19.550" style="s2">proposition is that we&#39;re now currently</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.480" end="00:06:23.870" style="s2">living out the consequences of that that</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.550" end="00:06:26.810" style="s2">decision and that the the progress the</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.870" end="00:06:28.580" style="s2">decision - the choice to continue to</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.810" end="00:06:31.760" style="s2">subsidize and support the financial</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.580" end="00:06:33.850" style="s2">layer and the economic layer at the cost</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.760" end="00:06:39.590" style="s2">of the political and the cultural layer</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.850" end="00:06:41.330" style="s2">is risky because it the layers work in</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.590" end="00:06:44.270" style="s2">that direction we know the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.330" end="00:06:47.630" style="s2">foundation is foundational and while it</p>
