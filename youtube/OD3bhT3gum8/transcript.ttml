<p begin="00:01:01.260" end="00:01:05.540" style="s2">put it that we need to redesign the</p>

<p begin="00:01:11.100" end="00:01:20.549" style="s2">redesigning our impact what do we need -</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.930" end="00:01:26.689" style="s2">well then you let me say first that this</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.549" end="00:01:31.110" style="s2">textbook is half theory and half</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.689" end="00:01:35.250" style="s2">applications so there are over 200 pages</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.110" end="00:01:39.090" style="s2">of applications to the economy to</p>

<p begin="00:01:53.549" end="00:01:59.460" style="s2">begins with the theory with the system&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.479" end="00:02:01.380" style="s2">view of life the nature of systems</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.460" end="00:02:04.380" style="s2">thinking and then the systemic</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.380" end="00:02:06.689" style="s2">understanding of life and then what does</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.380" end="00:02:10.619" style="s2">it mean for a system for your health</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.689" end="00:02:13.790" style="s2">what does it mean for the the climate</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.619" end="00:02:17.870" style="s2">crisis what does it mean for</p>

<p begin="00:02:17.870" end="00:02:24.780" style="s2">think you know from my early years of</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.230" end="00:02:28.620" style="s2">writing the turning point in in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.780" end="00:02:33.210" style="s2">early 1980s I&#39;ve always had you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.620" end="00:02:37.260" style="s2">applications in my mind and you know if</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.210" end="00:02:41.450" style="s2">you want to put it in extreme way I</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.260" end="00:02:44.460" style="s2">could quote Marx who said philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.450" end="00:02:47.730" style="s2">usually interpret the world but the</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.460" end="00:02:51.000" style="s2">point is to change it and so in in that</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.730" end="00:02:53.340" style="s2">sense I&#39;ve been a Marxist in in in this</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.000" end="00:02:57.660" style="s2">broader sense in in in all my life</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.340" end="00:03:01.310" style="s2">because the new understanding the new</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.660" end="00:03:03.290" style="s2">paradigm and the change of paradigms has</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.310" end="00:03:05.490" style="s2">important social and political</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.290" end="00:03:09.780" style="s2">implications and they&#39;ve always been in</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.490" end="00:03:14.340" style="s2">my mind you know since the 1960s so in</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.780" end="00:03:16.650" style="s2">answer to your question I think the the</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.340" end="00:03:20.900" style="s2">great challenge of our time the central</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.650" end="00:03:27.989" style="s2">challenge is to build sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.900" end="00:03:32.640" style="s2">communities to to build communities that</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.989" end="00:03:34.400" style="s2">do not interfere with nature&#39;s inherent</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.640" end="00:03:38.550" style="s2">ability to sustain life</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.400" end="00:03:41.730" style="s2">so for billions of years nature has</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.550" end="00:03:45.630" style="s2">sustained ecosystems and individual</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.730" end="00:03:49.709" style="s2">species and has sustained the processes</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.630" end="00:03:54.180" style="s2">of life and human activities especially</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.709" end="00:03:57.090" style="s2">since the Industrial Age have interfered</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.180" end="00:04:00.350" style="s2">with disability sustained to sustain</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.090" end="00:04:03.810" style="s2">life and now we need to very urgently</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.350" end="00:04:05.130" style="s2">reconnect with nature cooperate with</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.810" end="00:04:07.680" style="s2">nature honor</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.130" end="00:04:11.670" style="s2">nature&#39;s ability to sustain life and</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.680" end="00:04:15.330" style="s2">organize ourselves accordingly and so in</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.670" end="00:04:18.239" style="s2">order to do that obviously first we have</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.330" end="00:04:20.609" style="s2">to understand how nature sustains life</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.239" end="00:04:23.010" style="s2">and that&#39;s part of the system&#39;s we apply</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.609" end="00:04:25.930" style="s2">of the ecological dimension of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.010" end="00:04:29.800" style="s2">systems we arrive in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.930" end="00:04:33.760" style="s2">long history of evolution nature&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.800" end="00:04:37.030" style="s2">ecosystems have developed certain basic</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.760" end="00:04:41.040" style="s2">principles of sustainability or</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.030" end="00:04:47.610" style="s2">principles of ecology to sustain life</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.040" end="00:04:52.389" style="s2">you know principles like Network cycles</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.610" end="00:04:55.740" style="s2">diversity cooperation partnership and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.389" end="00:05:00.370" style="s2">on and we need to understand those and</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.740" end="00:05:06.790" style="s2">then redesign our physical structures</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.370" end="00:05:10.780" style="s2">our business organizations technologies</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.790" end="00:05:16.889" style="s2">social institutions accordingly now I</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.780" end="00:05:20.919" style="s2">have spent several decades now trying to</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.889" end="00:05:23.949" style="s2">explore and understand the basic</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.919" end="00:05:28.740" style="s2">principles of ecology and I&#39;ve come to</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.949" end="00:05:33.340" style="s2">the conclusion that you can summarize</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.740" end="00:05:39.600" style="s2">all these principles of ecology by</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.340" end="00:05:44.099" style="s2">saying nature sustains life by</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.600" end="00:05:49.900" style="s2">generating and maintaining communities</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.099" end="00:05:54.639" style="s2">community seems to be the key issue here</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.900" end="00:05:58.570" style="s2">that we know that no living organism can</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.639" end="00:06:02.970" style="s2">exist in isolation and in the long</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.570" end="00:06:07.360" style="s2">history of evolution from the very first</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.970" end="00:06:11.470" style="s2">bacterial cells which emerged about</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.360" end="00:06:15.099" style="s2">three and a half billion years ago from</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.470" end="00:06:19.750" style="s2">that point those cells formed</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.099" end="00:06:24.599" style="s2">communities known as bacterial colonies</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.750" end="00:06:28.240" style="s2">and ever since then Nature has created</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.599" end="00:06:32.520" style="s2">and sustained communities at all levels</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.240" end="00:06:36.969" style="s2">of life so in the last few years and</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.520" end="00:06:39.220" style="s2">this is not in the textbook I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.969" end="00:06:44.410" style="s2">write about this in the textbook which</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.220" end="00:06:48.640" style="s2">published in 2014 so in in the last six</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.410" end="00:06:53.350" style="s2">years the importance of community has</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.640" end="00:06:55.240" style="s2">become ever more important to me and has</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.350" end="00:06:59.050" style="s2">come to the foreground of my thinking</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.240" end="00:07:02.410" style="s2">ever more and if you want to I can you</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.050" end="00:07:06.700" style="s2">know tell you why I think community is</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.410" end="00:07:09.900" style="s2">so important reasons so the first one I</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.700" end="00:07:14.110" style="s2">mentioned already nature sustains life</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.900" end="00:07:19.630" style="s2">by creating and nurturing communities</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.110" end="00:07:24.060" style="s2">and if we want to do that then we will</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.630" end="00:07:27.970" style="s2">find very soon that one of the greatest</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.060" end="00:07:34.590" style="s2">obstacles in the way of creating a</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.970" end="00:07:38.770" style="s2">sustainable future is a constant assault</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.590" end="00:07:42.040" style="s2">by corporate advertising which tells us</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.770" end="00:07:44.640" style="s2">everyday that in order to be happy you</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.040" end="00:07:47.260" style="s2">have to consume you have to buy our</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.640" end="00:07:51.550" style="s2">products that&#39;s what will make you happy</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.260" end="00:07:54.610" style="s2">nothing else and some excessive material</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.550" end="00:07:57.460" style="s2">consumption which is used by the</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.610" end="00:08:02.110" style="s2">corporate world to sustain the illusion</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.460" end="00:08:04.450" style="s2">of perpetual growth corporate and</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.110" end="00:08:08.260" style="s2">economic growth this excessive</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.450" end="00:08:12.970" style="s2">consumption is seen as the way to</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.260" end="00:08:16.000" style="s2">happiness now if we can show the true</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.970" end="00:08:19.090" style="s2">happiness lies in human relationships</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.000" end="00:08:22.510" style="s2">rather than material consumption in</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.090" end="00:08:25.570" style="s2">other words in community you know then</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.510" end="00:08:28.540" style="s2">this is the biggest and most effective</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.570" end="00:08:32.710" style="s2">capitals so so that&#39;s the second reason</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.540" end="00:08:34.390" style="s2">my community is also also if you which I</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.710" end="00:08:38.349" style="s2">know from having lived in an intentional</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.390" end="00:08:43.210" style="s2">community if you organize our patterns</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.349" end="00:08:46.890" style="s2">of consumption communally you get a</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.210" end="00:08:48.899" style="s2">higher standard of life with consumption</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.890" end="00:08:51.899" style="s2">yes and that&#39;s also about the transition</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.899" end="00:08:54.269" style="s2">town movement does the many movements</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.899" end="00:08:57.079" style="s2">now who are trying to do that so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.269" end="00:09:02.700" style="s2">the second reason the third reason is</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.079" end="00:09:06.390" style="s2">that what we need to really live</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.700" end="00:09:08.850" style="s2">sustainably and and change the design of</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.390" end="00:09:12.000" style="s2">our physical structures and social</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.850" end="00:09:16.140" style="s2">institutions we need to learn a lot how</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.000" end="00:09:18.930" style="s2">to do that and it&#39;s not learning in</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.140" end="00:09:22.550" style="s2">terms of just absorbing new information</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.930" end="00:09:24.450" style="s2">but it&#39;s learning this transformative</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.550" end="00:09:28.440" style="s2">transformative learning that really</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.450" end="00:09:31.440" style="s2">changes our being our values and in in</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.440" end="00:09:35.310" style="s2">my experience community is the most</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.440" end="00:09:37.500" style="s2">effective vehicle for transformative</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.310" end="00:09:41.040" style="s2">learning learning as a learning</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.500" end="00:09:44.870" style="s2">community so those are our three reasons</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.040" end="00:09:48.120" style="s2">and there&#39;s a fourth one and that is</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.870" end="00:09:51.300" style="s2">that something we haven&#39;t talked about</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.120" end="00:09:55.230" style="s2">yet or implicitly we have but not</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.300" end="00:09:58.850" style="s2">explicitly and that is that the change</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.230" end="00:10:02.040" style="s2">to a new paradigm is not only a</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.850" end="00:10:04.470" style="s2">conceptual problem but it&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.040" end="00:10:09.410" style="s2">problem and even more so a problem of</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.470" end="00:10:13.980" style="s2">values the problem of ethics and ethics</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.410" end="00:10:19.260" style="s2">is usually talked about in relation to</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.980" end="00:10:21.870" style="s2">religion or philosophy but there is also</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.260" end="00:10:24.480" style="s2">a scientific approach that I have</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.870" end="00:10:31.760" style="s2">recently discovered to the question of</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.480" end="00:10:35.550" style="s2">ethics and that is that as I said before</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.760" end="00:10:39.839" style="s2">nature has sustained life by creating</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.550" end="00:10:44.070" style="s2">and nurturing communities and natural</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.839" end="00:10:48.269" style="s2">selection has favored those communities</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.070" end="00:10:50.970" style="s2">in which the individual members behave</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.269" end="00:10:54.120" style="s2">for the benefit of the community as a</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.970" end="00:10:57.120" style="s2">whole and in the human realm that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.120" end="00:11:00.089" style="s2">we call ethics but it&#39;s it&#39;s common to</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.120" end="00:11:00.570" style="s2">all of life&#39;s behavior for the common</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.089" end="00:11:04.170" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.570" end="00:11:07.230" style="s2">this is ethical behavior and that means</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.170" end="00:11:10.199" style="s2">that ethics is always related to</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.230" end="00:11:14.250" style="s2">community so these are several reasons</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.199" end="00:11:16.589" style="s2">why communities support Aldo Leopold as</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.250" end="00:11:20.449" style="s2">you know in in his wonderful little book</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.589" end="00:11:23.250" style="s2">saenko County Almanac from the 1960s and</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.449" end="00:11:25.680" style="s2">established as like I&#39;d like hope I</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.250" end="00:11:31.250" style="s2">remember the quote correctly a thing is</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.680" end="00:11:33.990" style="s2">right if it protects the vitality and</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.250" end="00:11:36.779" style="s2">connectivity of the biotic community it</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.990" end="00:11:39.360" style="s2">is wrong if it does otherwise right and</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.779" end="00:11:41.910" style="s2">so ultimately that&#39;s also and even said</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.360" end="00:11:45.870" style="s2">it uses the word biotic community you</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.910" end="00:11:47.579" style="s2">know basically we need to not just pay</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.870" end="00:11:51.690" style="s2">attention in a kind of much more</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.579" end="00:11:54.990" style="s2">equitable way a human family but as life</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.690" end="00:11:58.199" style="s2">as a community of living beings on this</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.990" end="00:12:01.980" style="s2">planet how do we judge our actions based</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.199" end="00:12:04.560" style="s2">on that ethic of life or not of course</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.980" end="00:12:07.319" style="s2">community is a technical term in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.560" end="00:12:10.529" style="s2">science of ecology an ecosystem is</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.319" end="00:12:12.720" style="s2">defined as a community of multiple</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.529" end="00:12:15.630" style="s2">species in interaction with their</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.720" end="00:12:18.149" style="s2">nonliving environment what I would add</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.630" end="00:12:20.250" style="s2">which I think it&#39;s so wonderful because</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.149" end="00:12:23.279" style="s2">really it is at the heart from your also</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.250" end="00:12:26.279" style="s2">of understanding life as a regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.279" end="00:12:28.500" style="s2">community how do we build regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.279" end="00:12:30.209" style="s2">communities that are sourced from the</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.500" end="00:12:34.199" style="s2">uniqueness of place and the uniqueness</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.209" end="00:12:36.569" style="s2">of culture in a particular location but</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.199" end="00:12:41.760" style="s2">what I personally noticed if I if I look</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.569" end="00:12:44.310" style="s2">at what&#39;s going on globally in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.760" end="00:12:46.290" style="s2">the the hopeful change movements a lot</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.310" end="00:12:50.100" style="s2">of people in have come to a similar</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.290" end="00:12:52.410" style="s2">conclusion as I have after spending 15</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.100" end="00:12:54.480" style="s2">years working with eco villages and</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.410" end="00:12:57.449" style="s2">transition towns and very much focusing</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.480" end="00:13:00.360" style="s2">on kind of design for sustainability at</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.449" end="00:13:02.370" style="s2">the community scale for many years even</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.360" end="00:13:04.800" style="s2">set up the world&#39;s first Masters with</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.370" end="00:13:09.510" style="s2">heriot-watt University on sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.800" end="00:13:12.060" style="s2">community design and what I began to</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.510" end="00:13:12.980" style="s2">realize is that there is as with life</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.060" end="00:13:15.199" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.980" end="00:13:17.839" style="s2">nested network of at different scales</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.199" end="00:13:20.000" style="s2">and where place is always fractal</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.839" end="00:13:23.870" style="s2">meaning what I do locally affects the</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.000" end="00:13:26.630" style="s2">region and affects the global then the</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.870" end="00:13:29.930" style="s2">one layer that we haven&#39;t paid a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.630" end="00:13:32.360" style="s2">attention to because of the mental</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.930" end="00:13:36.110" style="s2">colonialism of the nation-state which is</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.360" end="00:13:38.149" style="s2">a relatively new invention is the buyer</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.110" end="00:13:41.839" style="s2">region the watershed which is where</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.149" end="00:13:44.449" style="s2">where most of our species history we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.839" end="00:13:47.570" style="s2">lived in by original settlement patterns</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.449" end="00:13:51.800" style="s2">and in communities at the local level</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.570" end="00:13:53.750" style="s2">whether we were nomads or settled and in</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.800" end="00:13:56.089" style="s2">when you when you really want to create</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.750" end="00:13:58.010" style="s2">the whole systems design that that</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.089" end="00:14:00.529" style="s2">creates all the benefits around</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.010" end="00:14:03.050" style="s2">renewable energies circular biomaterials</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.529" end="00:14:05.540" style="s2">economies and all that to do so at the</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.050" end="00:14:07.970" style="s2">scale of a community is difficult also</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.540" end="00:14:09.920" style="s2">to do set the scale of the city alone is</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.970" end="00:14:12.110" style="s2">difficult but when you put the city or</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.920" end="00:14:14.930" style="s2">the community into the context of its</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.110" end="00:14:17.240" style="s2">watershed or region it&#39;s at that scale</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.930" end="00:14:20.029" style="s2">that those communities in that region</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.240" end="00:14:22.310" style="s2">collaborate to really creates designs</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.029" end="00:14:25.130" style="s2">that are regenerative and actually take</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.310" end="00:14:27.889" style="s2">care of the local ecosystem yeah have</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.130" end="00:14:33.110" style="s2">you written something about that I I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.889" end="00:14:36.430" style="s2">writing more and more about it yes and</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.110" end="00:14:41.269" style="s2">and I was just thinking you should also</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.430" end="00:14:45.529" style="s2">write about the fact that this in some</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.269" end="00:14:48.920" style="s2">way contradicts what many people think</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.529" end="00:14:52.269" style="s2">of when they think of community because</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.920" end="00:14:57.920" style="s2">they think of global digital communities</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.269" end="00:15:01.910" style="s2">and which are important too so how how</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.920" end="00:15:07.940" style="s2">to you know interface those to the</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.910" end="00:15:11.569" style="s2">global worldwide community you know my</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.940" end="00:15:14.720" style="s2">daughter who is 34 as friends all over</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.569" end="00:15:18.470" style="s2">the world with whom she&#39;s in contact</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.720" end="00:15:21.649" style="s2">you know continually and she also has a</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.470" end="00:15:26.930" style="s2">large circle of local friends with whom</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.649" end="00:15:31.420" style="s2">she goes out so you know trance</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.930" end="00:15:35.140" style="s2">to ecosystems we could say that that</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.420" end="00:15:40.279" style="s2">developing these economic structures</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.140" end="00:15:46.250" style="s2">within a bio region and being inspired</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.279" end="00:15:48.490" style="s2">by you know say crystal waters the the</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.250" end="00:15:52.810" style="s2">eco village in Australia that was</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.490" end="00:15:58.160" style="s2">co-created by my friend Maura gamble</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.810" end="00:16:00.890" style="s2">Gamble&#39;s the interface between those</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.160" end="00:16:04.370" style="s2">levels is something very interesting ya</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.890" end="00:16:09.050" style="s2">know what&#39;s interesting is that while</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.370" end="00:16:12.380" style="s2">you can go back as I don&#39;t digressing</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.050" end="00:16:13.339" style="s2">here but this isn&#39;t have you ever come</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.380" end="00:16:15.500" style="s2">across</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.339" end="00:16:16.160" style="s2">you know Sir Patrick Geddes you&#39;ve heard</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.500" end="00:16:19.820" style="s2">of him yet</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.160" end="00:16:20.810" style="s2">yes yeah and the last book that Geddes</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.820" end="00:16:22.850" style="s2">wrote was wither</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.810" end="00:16:25.279" style="s2">but another biologist from Aberdeen</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.850" end="00:16:29.209" style="s2">University was called and towards a</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.279" end="00:16:33.200" style="s2">general biology of life and it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.209" end="00:16:35.900" style="s2">published in the 1930s and in it with</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.200" end="00:16:38.150" style="s2">the limit of all the science that you</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.900" end="00:16:40.820" style="s2">draw upon in the system&#39;s view of life</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.150" end="00:16:42.800" style="s2">of course wasn&#39;t done yet and he</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.820" end="00:16:44.600" style="s2">actually was very strongly influenced by</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.800" end="00:16:47.300" style="s2">Young Christian Smuts who wrote the book</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.600" end="00:16:50.570" style="s2">on holism and he tried something similar</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.300" end="00:16:51.950" style="s2">to that grand synthesis but but the</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.570" end="00:16:53.570" style="s2">reason why starts talking about get is</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.950" end="00:16:56.529" style="s2">is not because of that but but Geddes</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.570" end="00:17:00.440" style="s2">was also the first person who as a</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.529" end="00:17:01.760" style="s2">biologist like he&#39;s known for being one</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.440" end="00:17:04.189" style="s2">of the founders of the discipline of</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.760" end="00:17:06.800" style="s2">town planning and the scientific study</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.189" end="00:17:08.660" style="s2">of sociology and he always said that</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.800" end="00:17:11.030" style="s2">cities had to be planned in their region</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.660" end="00:17:12.829" style="s2">and in many ways was the first Westerner</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.030" end="00:17:15.980" style="s2">to speak about the need for a</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.829" end="00:17:18.050" style="s2">bioregional approach and then he</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.980" end="00:17:19.880" style="s2">influenced Munford very hard strongly</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.050" end="00:17:23.179" style="s2">and one foot in the influenced Ian</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.880" end="00:17:25.280" style="s2">McHarg very strongly then they Ian my</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.179" end="00:17:27.110" style="s2">heart was kind of a mentor to the early</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.280" end="00:17:28.910" style="s2">bio regionalists where you live and</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.110" end="00:17:31.790" style="s2">Peter Burke and Raymond Desmond and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.910" end="00:17:35.620" style="s2">planet run foundation and so in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.790" end="00:17:35.620" style="s2">1970s there was this first</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.919" end="00:17:42.360" style="s2">idea of V inhabitation and Reed</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.290" end="00:17:46.380" style="s2">the human presence to the by regional</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.360" end="00:17:48.390" style="s2">scale very well yeah it never really</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.380" end="00:17:50.100" style="s2">went anywhere for many years</p>

<p begin="00:17:52.290" end="00:17:56.550" style="s2">years like if you look the the planetary</p>

<p begin="00:18:25.350" end="00:18:33.600" style="s2">there&#39;s something really and I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.760" end="00:18:37.080" style="s2">that&#39;s a very fertile ground that needs</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.600" end="00:18:38.550" style="s2">to be explored but but to not to digress</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.080" end="00:18:40.290" style="s2">any further because we just had the</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.550" end="00:18:42.480" style="s2">economy keyword one thing that I would</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.290" end="00:18:44.490" style="s2">love for you to just speak a bit about</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.480" end="00:18:48.390" style="s2">because for me that was a big insight</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.490" end="00:18:50.820" style="s2">and when I first came across this paper</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.390" end="00:18:53.640" style="s2">by you and Hazel Henderson from 2009</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.820" end="00:18:56.550" style="s2">that you wrote for some I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.640" end="00:19:03.270" style="s2">your body like the British Insurers or</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.550" end="00:19:05.250" style="s2">British and but there is this wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.270" end="00:19:08.160" style="s2">paper on the internet if anybody wants</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.250" end="00:19:10.230" style="s2">to look at it I&#39;m just saying Fritjof</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.160" end="00:19:13.560" style="s2">Capra hazel Henderson qualitative growth</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.230" end="00:19:16.440" style="s2">and it pops up as a PDF you can go to my</p>

<p begin="00:19:16.440" end="00:19:22.620" style="s2">it&#39;s in my blog this this notion because</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.190" end="00:19:27.420" style="s2">I I feel deeply uncomfortable as a</p>

<p begin="00:19:27.420" end="00:19:34.020" style="s2">growth D growth anti growth and it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.710" end="00:19:37.920" style="s2">type of growth measured with the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.020" end="00:19:40.350" style="s2">type of instruments like GDP and that is</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.920" end="00:19:46.490" style="s2">the problem so can you say a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.350" end="00:19:49.320" style="s2">about well you know when I looked at</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.490" end="00:19:52.020" style="s2">major problems of the world from a</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.320" end="00:19:54.090" style="s2">systemic perspective this was around the</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.020" end="00:19:54.540" style="s2">year 2000 when I wrote the book the</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.090" end="00:19:59.160" style="s2">hidden</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.540" end="00:20:01.620" style="s2">directions and when I realized that they</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.160" end="00:20:06.660" style="s2">are all systemically interconnected I</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.620" end="00:20:08.580" style="s2">actually drew a conceptual map of all</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.660" end="00:20:12.030" style="s2">the interconnections of the problems</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.580" end="00:20:14.940" style="s2">which is also reproduced in the textbook</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.030" end="00:20:19.410" style="s2">the system&#39;s view of life and I realized</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.940" end="00:20:23.300" style="s2">that that at the very basis of these</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.410" end="00:20:28.410" style="s2">problems is the fundamental dilemma of</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.300" end="00:20:31.800" style="s2">the illusion of Perpetual quantitative</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.410" end="00:20:34.830" style="s2">growth on a finite planet which is you</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.800" end="00:20:37.650" style="s2">know obviously you know an illusion it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.830" end="00:20:41.180" style="s2">nonsensical to believe the corporations</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.650" end="00:20:47.180" style="s2">and economies can can continually grow</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.180" end="00:20:50.310" style="s2">and yet you know virtually all our</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.180" end="00:20:55.370" style="s2">corporate and academic economists</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.310" end="00:20:59.190" style="s2">believe in their politicians of course</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.370" end="00:21:03.000" style="s2">so when they look at an economy they say</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.190" end="00:21:06.810" style="s2">well two percent growth is OK a 1</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.000" end="00:21:11.010" style="s2">percent is bad it&#39;s weak you know 3 or 4</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.810" end="00:21:13.230" style="s2">percent is a healthy economy and even if</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.010" end="00:21:16.700" style="s2">that&#39;s 3 or 4 percent of growth is</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.230" end="00:21:21.000" style="s2">caused by Wars and catastrophes and</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.700" end="00:21:22.620" style="s2">accidents and and means a doubling and</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.000" end="00:21:27.180" style="s2">it means a doubling of patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.620" end="00:21:31.860" style="s2">consumption yeah yeah so so this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.180" end="00:21:35.160" style="s2">obviously an an illusion and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.860" end="00:21:39.020" style="s2">many people have said we have to stop</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.160" end="00:21:42.870" style="s2">this we have to build and no growth</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.020" end="00:21:45.120" style="s2">economy or D growth in Italy there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.870" end="00:21:48.540" style="s2">big movement called decree schita which</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.120" end="00:21:50.990" style="s2">is d growth or negative growth and I</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.540" end="00:21:54.120" style="s2">agree completely with you from a</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.990" end="00:21:57.210" style="s2">biological and ecological standpoint you</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.120" end="00:21:59.760" style="s2">can say growth is an essential</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.210" end="00:22:02.610" style="s2">characteristic of life all living</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.760" end="00:22:04.620" style="s2">organisms grow but not everything grows</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.610" end="00:22:06.840" style="s2">at the same time and not everything</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.620" end="00:22:08.039" style="s2">grows all the time so in an ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.840" end="00:22:11.909" style="s2">for instance</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.039" end="00:22:16.019" style="s2">while certain things grow others reach</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.909" end="00:22:19.379" style="s2">maturity then decline disintegrate and</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.019" end="00:22:20.489" style="s2">provide nourishment for new growth in</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.379" end="00:22:23.039" style="s2">the next season</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.489" end="00:22:27.539" style="s2">like the leaves falling off trees and so</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.039" end="00:22:30.210" style="s2">on so what we need is really this kind</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.539" end="00:22:34.549" style="s2">of growth and I called it qualitative</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.210" end="00:22:38.970" style="s2">growth growth that is multifaceted and</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.549" end="00:22:41.659" style="s2">growth that includes inner growth in</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.970" end="00:22:45.779" style="s2">terms of an increase of complexity and</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.659" end="00:22:49.499" style="s2">maturity and so what we very urgently</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.779" end="00:22:52.440" style="s2">need is to qualify growth we need to</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.499" end="00:22:55.559" style="s2">distinguish between good growth and bad</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.440" end="00:22:57.869" style="s2">growth and then we need to decrease the</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.559" end="00:23:00.389" style="s2">bad growth and increase the good growth</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.869" end="00:23:02.570" style="s2">and from an ecological point of view</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.389" end="00:23:09.779" style="s2">this distinction is very easy and very</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.570" end="00:23:13.009" style="s2">simple so bad growth is growth that uses</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.779" end="00:23:17.119" style="s2">fossil fuels that includes toxic</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.009" end="00:23:20.820" style="s2">substances that consumes excessively</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.119" end="00:23:24.179" style="s2">material resources that is destructive</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.820" end="00:23:27.090" style="s2">of communities and so on good growth is</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.179" end="00:23:29.629" style="s2">the opposite it&#39;s the opposite that now</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.090" end="00:23:33.269" style="s2">it&#39;s growth that nourishes communities</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.629" end="00:23:37.139" style="s2">restores ecosystems is based on</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.269" end="00:23:39.809" style="s2">renewable resources contains no toxic</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.139" end="00:23:42.570" style="s2">chemicals and so on so we need to make</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.809" end="00:23:47.029" style="s2">that shift and it&#39;s a shift in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.570" end="00:23:53.609" style="s2">tax policies in terms of you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.029" end="00:23:55.679" style="s2">economic subsidies and and so on you</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.609" end="00:23:57.869" style="s2">know that that one thing I can</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.679" end="00:24:01.559" style="s2">absolutely can&#39;t understand is that</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.869" end="00:24:04.499" style="s2">governments today still subsidize fossil</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.559" end="00:24:07.109" style="s2">fuels you know to the tune of billions</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.499" end="00:24:09.960" style="s2">and billions of dollars this is these</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.109" end="00:24:12.989" style="s2">are so-called reverse subsidies and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.960" end="00:24:18.029" style="s2">more than 70% still go to fossil and</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.989" end="00:24:21.539" style="s2">nuclear and so that&#39;s what this mean</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.029" end="00:24:22.380" style="s2">meant by qualitative growth no I highly</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.539" end="00:24:25.440" style="s2">recommend</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.380" end="00:24:29.730" style="s2">to anybody to read the paper of yours</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.440" end="00:24:34.039" style="s2">and one other thing that that I would</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.730" end="00:24:37.049" style="s2">love to pick up just also to honor a</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.039" end="00:24:39.900" style="s2">common friend of ours was sadly died</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.049" end="00:24:44.039" style="s2">over ten years ago now and Professor</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.900" end="00:24:46.200" style="s2">Brian Goodwin from who I met when he had</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.039" end="00:24:48.990" style="s2">started the master&#39;s in holistic science</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.200" end="00:24:52.410" style="s2">at Omaha college and one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.990" end="00:24:55.620" style="s2">that I learned so much from Brian in in</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.410" end="00:24:58.500" style="s2">that time but one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.620" end="00:25:00.809" style="s2">always struck me was that as one of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.500" end="00:25:03.440" style="s2">you could say founding fathers of</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.809" end="00:25:06.900" style="s2">complexity theory is a mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.440" end="00:25:11.120" style="s2">method medicine and biologist and he</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.900" end="00:25:15.299" style="s2">always felt that a central lesson of</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.120" end="00:25:19.049" style="s2">complexity was that if you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.299" end="00:25:21.210" style="s2">slightly simplify what a definition of a</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.049" end="00:25:23.669" style="s2">complex dynamic system it&#39;s any system</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.210" end="00:25:29.880" style="s2">that has more than three interacting</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.669" end="00:25:34.350" style="s2">variables going back to Ponca lays three</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.880" end="00:25:36.270" style="s2">body problem those systems are</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.350" end="00:25:38.730" style="s2">fundamentally unpredictable and</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.270" end="00:25:41.250" style="s2">uncontrollable beyond certain scales of</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.730" end="00:25:43.169" style="s2">space and time and so he said that</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.250" end="00:25:45.809" style="s2">they&#39;re really an e alluded to it</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.169" end="00:25:48.150" style="s2">earlier the the purpose of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.809" end="00:25:51.530" style="s2">scientific enterprise for so long has</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.150" end="00:25:56.100" style="s2">been to predict and control and wrestle</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.530" end="00:26:00.299" style="s2">manipulable ax t out of complexity out</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.100" end="00:26:02.250" style="s2">of the rest of nature and and Brian made</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.299" end="00:26:05.159" style="s2">this point that what we really need is</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.250" end="00:26:06.929" style="s2">to know how to participate appropriately</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.159" end="00:26:08.610" style="s2">and he said that we this is not</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.929" end="00:26:11.580" style="s2">something that we&#39;re going to get</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.610" end="00:26:14.400" style="s2">through a statistics and quantitative</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.580" end="00:26:16.289" style="s2">analysis driven science which is useful</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.400" end="00:26:18.870" style="s2">and powerful and and we should continue</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.289" end="00:26:22.470" style="s2">to do it but put it in its place and</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.870" end="00:26:24.330" style="s2">what we need is a science of quality to</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.470" end="00:26:26.490" style="s2">really make this shift and then he drew</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.330" end="00:26:31.049" style="s2">on good he drew on complexity and a</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.490" end="00:26:34.090" style="s2">number of of lineages from which to</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.049" end="00:26:36.909" style="s2">build the signs of qualities</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.090" end="00:26:40.360" style="s2">well Brian Goodwin influenced my</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.909" end="00:26:45.760" style="s2">thinking enormous ly I met him in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.360" end="00:26:49.780" style="s2">early 1970s in London and he was a kind</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.760" end="00:26:52.710" style="s2">of maverick who had you know outrageous</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.780" end="00:26:55.900" style="s2">ideas and in the biological community</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.710" end="00:27:00.250" style="s2">people smiled you know and it&#39;ll there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.900" end="00:27:03.490" style="s2">Brian Goodwin you know and and this was</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.250" end="00:27:06.580" style="s2">long before complexity theory it was</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.490" end="00:27:09.610" style="s2">very unique as you know because he had a</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.580" end="00:27:16.780" style="s2">very rich philosophical and artistic</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.610" end="00:27:21.220" style="s2">background and he in science was an</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.780" end="00:27:23.980" style="s2">evolutionary biologist complexity</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.220" end="00:27:26.919" style="s2">theorist and and because he was also a</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.980" end="00:27:29.919" style="s2">mathematician he also had a strong</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.919" end="00:27:33.580" style="s2">spiritual dimension and that combination</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.919" end="00:27:36.010" style="s2">of you know art and literature and</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.580" end="00:27:38.799" style="s2">philosophy and spirituality on the one</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.010" end="00:27:45.299" style="s2">hand and science and mathematics on the</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.799" end="00:27:45.299" style="s2">other is is very unique and so Brian</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.690" end="00:27:50.950" style="s2">participated in many of my shoe Maha</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.159" end="00:27:54.690" style="s2">courses and we had fabulous discussions</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.950" end="00:28:00.580" style="s2">and one statement I remember very well</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.690" end="00:28:03.870" style="s2">was that he said complex systems are not</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.580" end="00:28:07.299" style="s2">predictable but they are intelligible</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.870" end="00:28:10.000" style="s2">and that is just very beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.299" end="00:28:14.409" style="s2">statement that sort of encapsulates the</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.000" end="00:28:16.900" style="s2">nature and you know he was completely</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.409" end="00:28:19.929" style="s2">right with the science of qualities and</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.900" end="00:28:23.770" style="s2">I alluded to that when I talked about</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.929" end="00:28:26.980" style="s2">qualitative growth but not only that the</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.770" end="00:28:29.590" style="s2">entire systems view of life is is a</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.980" end="00:28:33.659" style="s2">science of qualities because it is a</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.590" end="00:28:37.659" style="s2">science of patterns a science of</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.659" end="00:28:40.649" style="s2">relationships a science of systemic</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.659" end="00:28:45.789" style="s2">properties and this is what quality is</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.649" end="00:28:46.840" style="s2">quality is a property of the whole which</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.789" end="00:28:49.300" style="s2">is not present</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.840" end="00:28:54.340" style="s2">in the parts it&#39;s a systemic property</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.300" end="00:28:58.210" style="s2">for instance my state of health is not</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.340" end="00:29:00.910" style="s2">the sum of the health of my heart and</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.210" end="00:29:05.230" style="s2">liver and my toes and my teeth</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.910" end="00:29:07.690" style="s2">but is a result of the interactions</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.230" end="00:29:10.180" style="s2">between those parts and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.690" end="00:29:13.480" style="s2">relationships between those parts it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.180" end="00:29:16.090" style="s2">an emergent property a systemic property</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.480" end="00:29:18.300" style="s2">this is what qualities are and this is</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.090" end="00:29:20.530" style="s2">exactly what the system&#39;s we apply this</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.300" end="00:29:23.080" style="s2">picking you up on this the health thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.530" end="00:29:24.730" style="s2">which I think is was one of the big</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.080" end="00:29:27.880" style="s2">insights that I also gained through</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.730" end="00:29:30.970" style="s2">working with Brian and and it ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.880" end="00:29:33.520" style="s2">led me to when when I wrote my PhD he</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.970" end="00:29:36.160" style="s2">also met you know Seton Baxter I met him</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.520" end="00:29:38.920" style="s2">at Omaha college and and Seton was the</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.160" end="00:29:41.770" style="s2">one who read my slightly oversized</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.920" end="00:29:43.480" style="s2">master&#39;s thesis which was 300 pages long</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.770" end="00:29:44.880" style="s2">that&#39;s effing didn&#39;t even want to read</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.480" end="00:29:48.580" style="s2">the whole thing and said cut it down</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.880" end="00:29:51.700" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a PhD and and Seton came</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.580" end="00:29:54.040" style="s2">back and said look I I&#39;ll find a</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.700" end="00:29:56.260" style="s2">scholarship for you if he ever wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.040" end="00:29:58.210" style="s2">do a PhD and so I a couple of years</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.260" end="00:30:02.500" style="s2">later ended up doing my PhD with Seton</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.210" end="00:30:03.670" style="s2">in a design school and I thought that it</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.500" end="00:30:07.870" style="s2">was going to be on design for</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.670" end="00:30:09.760" style="s2">sustainability and then being influenced</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.870" end="00:30:11.470" style="s2">by your work being influenced by Brian&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.760" end="00:30:13.090" style="s2">work by Stephan Harding and all the</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.470" end="00:30:16.870" style="s2">wonderful people that I&#39;d met at Omaha</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.090" end="00:30:19.000" style="s2">college um I actually realized that when</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.870" end="00:30:20.730" style="s2">we talk about sustainability we talk</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.000" end="00:30:24.520" style="s2">about the pattern that connects as</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.730" end="00:30:26.530" style="s2">Bateson would have called it and when we</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.520" end="00:30:28.720" style="s2">ask what is it that we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.530" end="00:30:32.230" style="s2">sustain we&#39;re trying to sustain the web</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.720" end="00:30:35.520" style="s2">of life the regenerative community and</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.230" end="00:30:37.930" style="s2">so another word of saying that is health</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.520" end="00:30:40.870" style="s2">systemic health exactly as you just</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.930" end="00:30:44.350" style="s2">described it and I used this this notion</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.870" end="00:30:46.870" style="s2">of health being an emergent property at</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.350" end="00:30:49.150" style="s2">different scales across the complex</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.870" end="00:30:51.880" style="s2">dynamic system is a systemic property</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.150" end="00:30:54.550" style="s2">that that has fractal-like its cellular</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.880" end="00:30:56.500" style="s2">health organelle body health family</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.550" end="00:31:00.179" style="s2">health community health ecosystems</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.500" end="00:31:02.429" style="s2">health planet and I used this too</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.179" end="00:31:04.230" style="s2">to work with what what I called the</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.429" end="00:31:05.580" style="s2">scales of design Minh I don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.230" end="00:31:08.100" style="s2">wanted to ask you are you familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.580" end="00:31:13.850" style="s2">the work of a guy called Aaron Antonov</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.100" end="00:31:16.740" style="s2">ski an Israeli health scientist no he he</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.850" end="00:31:20.700" style="s2">did a lot of research on Holocaust</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.740" end="00:31:23.249" style="s2">survivors and looked at what was the the</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.700" end="00:31:26.669" style="s2">uniqueness that enable people to go</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.249" end="00:31:29.490" style="s2">through enormous trauma and still be</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.669" end="00:31:33.899" style="s2">able to go on and and also how people</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.490" end="00:31:36.600" style="s2">different people responded to stresses</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.899" end="00:31:38.549" style="s2">that would make some people ill and died</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.600" end="00:31:40.830" style="s2">and other people would survive and he</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.549" end="00:31:45.090" style="s2">developed in a book called health stress</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.830" end="00:31:47.519" style="s2">and coping in the 1960s in new approach</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.090" end="00:31:50.580" style="s2">to health rather than a pathogenic</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.519" end="00:31:53.340" style="s2">approach to health which is looking at</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.580" end="00:31:56.249" style="s2">what drives the disease and and dealing</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.340" end="00:31:59.100" style="s2">with symptoms so that the Roman law no</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.249" end="00:32:01.289" style="s2">allopathic approach he said we need a</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.100" end="00:32:03.960" style="s2">solute or genic approach to health we</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.289" end="00:32:05.999" style="s2">need to look at and what are the</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.960" end="00:32:08.700" style="s2">conditions because health is this</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.999" end="00:32:11.269" style="s2">dynamic balance you constantly get viral</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.700" end="00:32:14.549" style="s2">vectors and bacterial vectors trying to</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.269" end="00:32:17.730" style="s2">distract and that that is my definition</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.549" end="00:32:21.049" style="s2">of the systems you of health health is a</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.730" end="00:32:23.669" style="s2">state of dynamic balance which involves</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.049" end="00:32:27.749" style="s2">biological dimensions social dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.669" end="00:32:29.279" style="s2">and ecological dimensions if you send</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.749" end="00:32:31.409" style="s2">you some links or snd actually a</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.279" end="00:32:33.539" style="s2">Symington whole book on saluted Genesis</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.409" end="00:32:36.029" style="s2">that&#39;s basically what the jello to</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.539" end="00:32:38.269" style="s2">generate approach is about okay there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.029" end="00:32:41.789" style="s2">one last question thank you so much</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.269" end="00:32:43.950" style="s2">there&#39;s marathon conversation and I just</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.789" end="00:32:46.710" style="s2">really wanted to name one more person in</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.950" end="00:32:50.279" style="s2">this context of our conversation who has</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.710" end="00:32:53.129" style="s2">been another elder of mine like you and</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.279" end="00:32:56.879" style="s2">Brian in in putting me on my path and</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.129" end="00:32:58.470" style="s2">and that&#39;s David or who I first met at</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.879" end="00:33:02.369" style="s2">Juma hawala was on the Masters course</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.470" end="00:33:04.830" style="s2">and he and John Todd and Nancy ejected</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.369" end="00:33:06.690" style="s2">and offered a short course on ecological</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.830" end="00:33:09.600" style="s2">design and that&#39;s when I first</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.690" end="00:33:12.049" style="s2">understood the power of design in</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.600" end="00:33:13.950" style="s2">bringing it like human intention</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.049" end="00:33:17.519" style="s2">expressed through interactions</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.950" end="00:33:20.070" style="s2">and relationships bringing this new</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.519" end="00:33:23.360" style="s2">holistic worldview and systems view of</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.070" end="00:33:29.399" style="s2">life into action is through design and</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.360" end="00:33:32.429" style="s2">let me just David over here that this is</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.399" end="00:33:41.159" style="s2">what I use in in all my work he defines</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.429" end="00:33:44.610" style="s2">design as the shaping of flows of energy</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.159" end="00:33:47.159" style="s2">and matter for human purposes that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.610" end="00:33:50.159" style="s2">ecological definition of design and then</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.159" end="00:33:56.460" style="s2">he defined defines ecological design or</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.159" end="00:33:59.730" style="s2">eco design as meshing those human</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.460" end="00:34:03.090" style="s2">purposes with the natural flows and</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.730" end="00:34:06.360" style="s2">patterns in nature so that has been very</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.090" end="00:34:10.440" style="s2">inspired that yeah basically that put me</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.360" end="00:34:13.320" style="s2">on my path like I was somewhat impatient</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.440" end="00:34:16.230" style="s2">and frustrated having learned the</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.320" end="00:34:18.359" style="s2">wonderful theory of holistic science and</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.230" end="00:34:20.069" style="s2">I wanted to say but the world&#39;s burning</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.359" end="00:34:22.500" style="s2">how do we put this interaction and</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.069" end="00:34:25.829" style="s2">that&#39;s when I realized meeting John Todd</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.500" end="00:34:28.169" style="s2">and and also Nancy Todd and David and</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.829" end="00:34:30.300" style="s2">that ecological design was what I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.169" end="00:34:33.210" style="s2">to dedicate my future to him</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.300" end="00:34:35.429" style="s2">and so I wrote this PhD and at the end</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.210" end="00:34:37.950" style="s2">of it David actually ended up being my</p>

<p begin="00:34:37.950" end="00:34:45.060" style="s2">all over and done I went to see him at</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.829" end="00:34:47.760" style="s2">Oberlin College in in Ohio and I did an</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.060" end="00:34:50.190" style="s2">interview which would still floats about</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.760" end="00:34:53.339" style="s2">on YouTube somewhere in 2006 with him</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.190" end="00:34:56.180" style="s2">where I asked him about the original</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.339" end="00:34:59.069" style="s2">question was actually about the</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.180" end="00:35:01.619" style="s2">dimension of spirituality and the sacred</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.069" end="00:35:03.660" style="s2">in the transition that we now had to do</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.619" end="00:35:07.650" style="s2">to redesign the human impact on earth</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.660" end="00:35:11.849" style="s2">before our very young species would die</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.650" end="00:35:13.950" style="s2">an early death and um in his answer he</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.849" end="00:35:16.260" style="s2">said something that was just basically</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.950" end="00:35:17.700" style="s2">the seed for designing regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.260" end="00:35:19.829" style="s2">culture ten years before I wrote the</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.700" end="00:35:22.650" style="s2">book he gave me the seed for that he</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.829" end="00:35:25.710" style="s2">said before we can ask or answer</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.650" end="00:35:28.230" style="s2">appropriately the</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.710" end="00:35:30.600" style="s2">the what we need to do to create a</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.230" end="00:35:33.630" style="s2">sustainable human presence or how we</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.600" end="00:35:35.730" style="s2">might go about doing it we need to ask</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.630" end="00:35:37.470" style="s2">ourselves a more complicated question a</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.730" end="00:35:41.760" style="s2">much more difficult question which is</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.470" end="00:35:46.320" style="s2">what is it about human beings that makes</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.760" end="00:35:49.950" style="s2">us worth sustaining and that just for me</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.320" end="00:35:52.380" style="s2">was a like a big question to mull on for</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.950" end="00:35:56.970" style="s2">a long time and I would love for you to</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.380" end="00:35:58.770" style="s2">to give us your take from your long life</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.970" end="00:36:01.950" style="s2">and having met some of the most</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.770" end="00:36:05.180" style="s2">inspiring human beings in my perspective</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.950" end="00:36:10.680" style="s2">on the planet in the last 50 years and</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.180" end="00:36:13.260" style="s2">what what is it that you think is our</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.680" end="00:36:15.090" style="s2">unique contribution as human beings and</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.260" end="00:36:19.680" style="s2">why is it would it be a shame if we died</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.090" end="00:36:23.220" style="s2">early as a species well I think I would</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.680" end="00:36:30.650" style="s2">give you an an answer from the</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.220" end="00:36:35.520" style="s2">perspective of evolution what the</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.650" end="00:36:37.980" style="s2">life-forms that are worth sustaining are</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.520" end="00:36:41.340" style="s2">actually the ones that are sustained in</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.980" end="00:36:46.670" style="s2">evolution and they are the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.340" end="00:36:50.430" style="s2">best contribute to the continual</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.670" end="00:36:53.970" style="s2">regeneration and unfolding of life so to</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.430" end="00:36:56.220" style="s2">the extent that we contribute to that we</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.970" end="00:36:59.430" style="s2">are birth sustaining and we will be</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.220" end="00:37:01.290" style="s2">sustained by nature if we do that to the</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.430" end="00:37:05.250" style="s2">extent that we are not contributing</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.290" end="00:37:08.460" style="s2">which is you know much more at present</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.250" end="00:37:12.090" style="s2">and in our contributions we will not be</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.460" end="00:37:16.050" style="s2">sustained now if you look at the history</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.090" end="00:37:20.640" style="s2">of evolution you can see that the</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.050" end="00:37:24.330" style="s2">average life span of a species from its</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.640" end="00:37:28.890" style="s2">emergence to its extinction is about</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.330" end="00:37:31.560" style="s2">five million years so on the average the</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.890" end="00:37:34.320" style="s2">species that have lived much longer and</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.560" end="00:37:39.210" style="s2">others much shorter but the average is</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.320" end="00:37:42.420" style="s2">about 5 million years now Homo sapiens</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.210" end="00:37:47.400" style="s2">has lived for about thirty thousand</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.420" end="00:37:48.000" style="s2">years so we are new comers still on the</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.400" end="00:37:53.190" style="s2">planet</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.000" end="00:37:57.950" style="s2">we have lived less than 1% of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.190" end="00:38:01.380" style="s2">average lifespan of his species so it is</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.950" end="00:38:04.950" style="s2">much too early to tell whether we are</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.380" end="00:38:07.500" style="s2">worth sustaining or not but you know at</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.950" end="00:38:12.470" style="s2">present it doesn&#39;t look very good you</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.500" end="00:38:16.140" style="s2">know we can definitely say that so I</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.470" end="00:38:23.030" style="s2">mean this this this is a dire question</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.140" end="00:38:29.100" style="s2">and I would say that my sense of hope</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.030" end="00:38:33.780" style="s2">for sustainability and the continuation</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.100" end="00:38:36.510" style="s2">of humanity on the planet has been</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.780" end="00:38:40.080" style="s2">inspired very much by Watts love hobble</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.510" end="00:38:42.290" style="s2">the great Czech playwright and former</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.080" end="00:38:47.300" style="s2">president of the Czech Republic and</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.290" end="00:38:51.950" style="s2">hobble wrote something where he turns</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.300" end="00:38:55.140" style="s2">the assessment or they the the</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.950" end="00:39:00.090" style="s2">exploration of hope into a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.140" end="00:39:03.750" style="s2">meditation on the nature of hope and he</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.090" end="00:39:07.650" style="s2">says that hope is a dimension of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.750" end="00:39:10.110" style="s2">soul not the result of a certain</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.650" end="00:39:12.660" style="s2">assessment of the state of the world and</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.110" end="00:39:16.140" style="s2">he writes and he wrote this while he was</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.660" end="00:39:19.170" style="s2">imprisoned as a dissident by the Soviet</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.140" end="00:39:22.440" style="s2">regime and let me read to you what what</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.170" end="00:39:25.080" style="s2">he writes about hope he writes hope is</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.440" end="00:39:27.690" style="s2">not the conviction that something will</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.080" end="00:39:30.780" style="s2">turn out well but the certainty that</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.690" end="00:39:34.710" style="s2">something makes sense regardless of how</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.780" end="00:39:37.590" style="s2">it turns out so this has inspired me</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.710" end="00:39:39.900" style="s2">tremendously for the last years many</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.590" end="00:39:43.320" style="s2">years and it&#39;s hard trying to live my</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.900" end="00:39:47.240" style="s2">life yeah I would second that and they</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.320" end="00:39:47.240" style="s2">also like days something about</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.880" end="00:39:55.200" style="s2">in I you know get people finally going</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.550" end="00:39:58.140" style="s2">into the street and raising an alarm</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.200" end="00:39:59.490" style="s2">about the imminence of not just we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.140" end="00:40:01.740" style="s2">already in the middle middle of</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.490" end="00:40:04.290" style="s2">catastrophic climate change but we have</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.740" end="00:40:06.560" style="s2">a opportunity and the window of</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.290" end="00:40:08.940" style="s2">opportunity is closing to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.560" end="00:40:12.000" style="s2">cataclysmic climate change where we get</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.940" end="00:40:14.250" style="s2">to a point where basically higher life</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.000" end="00:40:19.110" style="s2">forms such as ours will not be on this</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.250" end="00:40:21.230" style="s2">planet for a while and I&#39;m facing almost</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.110" end="00:40:26.010" style="s2">like a species level rite of passage</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.230" end="00:40:28.650" style="s2">facing the real possibility of death at</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.010" end="00:40:31.230" style="s2">this early point in this jump to the</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.650" end="00:40:34.290" style="s2">next stage of them being a more mature</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.230" end="00:40:37.950" style="s2">species a more mature member in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.290" end="00:40:40.350" style="s2">community of life I often find that what</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.950" end="00:40:42.570" style="s2">we actually asked also came back to is</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.350" end="00:40:44.160" style="s2">where you also started we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.570" end="00:40:46.170" style="s2">about the cup of course earlier the bed</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.160" end="00:40:49.380" style="s2">today there is some kind of spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.170" end="00:40:52.230" style="s2">subtext to all of this that that brings</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.380" end="00:40:55.980" style="s2">us back into not just what we do but how</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.230" end="00:40:57.630" style="s2">we are into our being and our connection</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.980" end="00:41:00.300" style="s2">like this wonderful conversation we just</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.630" end="00:41:02.670" style="s2">had and to celebrate this they say like</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.300" end="00:41:05.550" style="s2">for me it&#39;s that level of connection</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.670" end="00:41:08.670" style="s2">that is why we&#39;re worth sustaining as a</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.550" end="00:41:11.550" style="s2">species that we that we can write poems</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.670" end="00:41:14.880" style="s2">about love like me rooted it and that we</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.550" end="00:41:18.120" style="s2">can write symphonies or songs like the</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.880" end="00:41:20.700" style="s2">ode to joy&#39; that was written by Sheila</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.120" end="00:41:23.310" style="s2">and then put to music by Beethoven there</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.700" end="00:41:26.490" style="s2">is some grandeur there is some beauty in</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.310" end="00:41:28.680" style="s2">us and we have proven particularly our</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.490" end="00:41:31.050" style="s2">indigenous brothers and sisters have</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.680" end="00:41:34.500" style="s2">proven in many places around the world</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.050" end="00:41:37.170" style="s2">that we can also be gardeners that we</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.500" end="00:41:38.820" style="s2">can have a healing influence on</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.170" end="00:41:42.150" style="s2">ecosystems like for example the Amazon</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.820" end="00:41:45.840" style="s2">rainforest being partially human made by</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.150" end="00:41:48.210" style="s2">by its only inhabitants so yeah from for</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.840" end="00:41:51.570" style="s2">me it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a coming back to</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.210" end="00:41:55.430" style="s2">the moment and an appreciation and and</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.570" end="00:41:58.530" style="s2">so deep appreciation also to it or yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.430" end="00:42:00.500" style="s2">yeah we should we should continue having</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.530" end="00:42:03.680" style="s2">these conversations and</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.500" end="00:42:07.070" style="s2">and you know continue to build these</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.680" end="00:42:09.950" style="s2">communities of systemic thinkers and</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.070" end="00:42:12.620" style="s2">activists as I do in my capra course and</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.950" end="00:42:14.060" style="s2">you do in your networks and you work so</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.620" end="00:42:17.420" style="s2">let&#39;s continue</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.060" end="00:42:19.670" style="s2">we were regeneration rising trim tabs</p>
