<p begin="00:00:00.770" end="00:00:08.130" style="s2">all right so welcome to another waiting</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.430" end="00:00:12.630" style="s2">for the meeting crisis discord Q&amp;A with</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.130" end="00:00:15.240" style="s2">part 2 with Nick B who has been telling</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.630" end="00:00:19.170" style="s2">us about the lessons he&#39;s learned from</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.240" end="00:00:22.500" style="s2">his time in cults and in for cults and</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.170" end="00:00:24.600" style="s2">so last week he he took us through sort</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.500" end="00:00:28.410" style="s2">of the story and now I think we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.600" end="00:00:30.210" style="s2">to get a little more into the what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.410" end="00:00:34.460" style="s2">learned from from that time so again</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.210" end="00:00:34.460" style="s2">thank you Nick for for being here</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.520" end="00:00:41.879" style="s2">absolutely yeah this this part is a</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.360" end="00:00:44.670" style="s2">little bit more theoretical and more of</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.879" end="00:00:50.430" style="s2">the kind of sense making that I&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.670" end="00:00:53.969" style="s2">after the fact it&#39;s a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.430" end="00:00:55.680" style="s2">controversial as well if some of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.969" end="00:01:01.620" style="s2">conversations I&#39;ve had about this topic</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.680" end="00:01:06.930" style="s2">are any indication so yeah let&#39;s see the</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.620" end="00:01:09.479" style="s2">plan I&#39;ve got for today is starting with</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.930" end="00:01:12.240" style="s2">the etymology of the word kind of how</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.479" end="00:01:16.560" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s popular use that we now think</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.240" end="00:01:18.810" style="s2">of it in terms of in terms of came about</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.560" end="00:01:21.270" style="s2">because it&#39;s actually extremely recent</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.810" end="00:01:28.530" style="s2">that we started using the word cult this</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.270" end="00:01:35.189" style="s2">way from there I go into what I consider</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.530" end="00:01:38.130" style="s2">to be a much more useful framing so a</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.189" end="00:01:41.549" style="s2">lot of that is dealing with quite</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.130" end="00:01:45.240" style="s2">directly posing an alternative use for</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.549" end="00:01:48.050" style="s2">the word and the idea of what a cult is</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.240" end="00:01:49.440" style="s2">and what it represents</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.050" end="00:01:54.890" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.440" end="00:01:58.200" style="s2">and then from there I go into some</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.890" end="00:02:00.840" style="s2">features of cults and I kind of frame</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.200" end="00:02:02.730" style="s2">this question rather than what makes</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.840" end="00:02:05.400" style="s2">something a cult and what makes it not a</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.730" end="00:02:07.410" style="s2">cult I instead try and frame the</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.400" end="00:02:11.040" style="s2">question around what makes a good cult</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.410" end="00:02:16.560" style="s2">and what makes a bad cult and how do how</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.040" end="00:02:18.510" style="s2">does this transition occur and as you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.560" end="00:02:23.120" style="s2">see when I get to that part many of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.510" end="00:02:26.640" style="s2">aspects that we find in cults we we find</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.120" end="00:02:29.160" style="s2">you know everywhere within our culture</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.640" end="00:02:33.560" style="s2">and our society and even our direct</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.160" end="00:02:33.560" style="s2">personal relationships and friendships</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.100" end="00:02:40.490" style="s2">and yeah I&#39;ll talk more about that</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.800" end="00:02:51.160" style="s2">right so starting off I figured I&#39;d go</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.510" end="00:02:54.790" style="s2">start off pretty clear-cut here the word</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.160" end="00:02:59.980" style="s2">cult really wasn&#39;t used very much until</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.790" end="00:03:02.560" style="s2">the late 19th century early 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.980" end="00:03:08.380" style="s2">and we see a pretty sharp spike in its</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.560" end="00:03:13.120" style="s2">arrived or in its use around 1910 to</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.380" end="00:03:19.570" style="s2">1920 this also coincides with the first</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.120" end="00:03:23.490" style="s2">Red Scare around 1920 although we</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.570" end="00:03:26.320" style="s2">actually see its use coming up from</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.490" end="00:03:30.360" style="s2">religious people making Kierkegaard e&#39;en</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.320" end="00:03:33.700" style="s2">like critiques about religion so they</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.360" end="00:03:37.420" style="s2">Iran eclis enough they they wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.700" end="00:03:39.100" style="s2">call their worship cult it a cult rather</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.420" end="00:03:41.650" style="s2">than a religion because they felt that</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.100" end="00:03:44.500" style="s2">the word religion had been to neutered</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.650" end="00:03:47.560" style="s2">and did not accurately represent any</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.500" end="00:03:51.580" style="s2">longer what it meant to be a religious</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.560" end="00:03:53.590" style="s2">person had been so soaked up by the</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.580" end="00:03:55.510" style="s2">dominant culture that you people</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.590" end="00:03:59.070" style="s2">couldn&#39;t even tell that they were in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.510" end="00:04:04.570" style="s2">religion to some degree just because the</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.070" end="00:04:06.670" style="s2">it was such a universal belief so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.570" end="00:04:13.140" style="s2">that&#39;s where you start seeing our modern</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.670" end="00:04:17.230" style="s2">use of it Crump back up the word cult</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.140" end="00:04:21.280" style="s2">comes from Latin koltes which means care</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.230" end="00:04:24.190" style="s2">labor cultivation culture worship or</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.280" end="00:04:28.120" style="s2">reverence and originally tended or</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.190" end="00:04:31.990" style="s2">cultivated from the past participle of</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.120" end="00:04:37.020" style="s2">Coulier - till right so tilling</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.990" end="00:04:37.020" style="s2">preparing something for growth</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.030" end="00:04:47.450" style="s2">opening something up right opening this</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.970" end="00:04:53.990" style="s2">potential by which something may you</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.450" end="00:04:59.890" style="s2">know happen it shares the root the same</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.990" end="00:05:04.010" style="s2">root Colo as colony does and colonial</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.890" end="00:05:05.450" style="s2">which is probably an interesting tie for</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.010" end="00:05:12.850" style="s2">how people talk about to loan</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.450" end="00:05:16.090" style="s2">utilization today and interestingly</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.850" end="00:05:16.090" style="s2">let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.360" end="00:05:28.210" style="s2">yeah so from in in fits word halls</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.199" end="00:05:31.879" style="s2">modern English from 1873 we see this</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.210" end="00:05:36.050" style="s2">movement of the word cult back into</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.879" end="00:05:38.930" style="s2">religious conversation where he says</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.050" end="00:05:42.169" style="s2">cult is a turn which as we value</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.930" end="00:05:44.599" style="s2">exactness we can ill do without seeing</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.169" end="00:05:49.639" style="s2">how completely religion has lost its</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.599" end="00:05:52.490" style="s2">original signification and then write</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.639" end="00:05:55.120" style="s2">another entry I jokingly put in here but</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.490" end="00:05:59.389" style="s2">I think is very relevant for for the</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.120" end="00:06:01.940" style="s2">discussion later is cult an organized</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.389" end="00:06:05.569" style="s2">group of people religious or not with</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.940" end="00:06:09.620" style="s2">whom you disagree and this is from hugh</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.569" end="00:06:11.719" style="s2">ross ins wicked words from 1993 which is</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.620" end="00:06:13.900" style="s2">obviously written with a strong dose of</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.719" end="00:06:13.900" style="s2">irony</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.440" end="00:06:22.940" style="s2">so yeah what I want to kind of focus on</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.180" end="00:06:24.920" style="s2">here is this transition by which the</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.940" end="00:06:26.980" style="s2">word cult picks up its pejorative</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.920" end="00:06:30.820" style="s2">meaning and this actually happens</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.980" end="00:06:36.470" style="s2">surprisingly later than one would think</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.820" end="00:06:40.760" style="s2">you know it&#39;s as late as 1977 the</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.470" end="00:06:44.030" style="s2">dictionary had no pejorative definition</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.760" end="00:06:46.280" style="s2">for the word cult and you know it still</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.030" end="00:06:51.350" style="s2">was not defined by what we would now</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.280" end="00:06:53.090" style="s2">call a cult so it&#39;s it&#39;s granted</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.350" end="00:06:56.780" style="s2">dictionaries sometimes take a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.090" end="00:07:01.100" style="s2">of time to alter meaningfully words and</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.780" end="00:07:05.960" style="s2">how they change it seems pretty clear</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.100" end="00:07:08.420" style="s2">that it wasn&#39;t until the early to mid</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.960" end="00:07:10.130" style="s2">70s or so that the word cult</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.420" end="00:07:12.140" style="s2">really started getting this pejorative</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.130" end="00:07:14.360" style="s2">connotation and you can actually even</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.140" end="00:07:16.970" style="s2">see it like if you look up the news</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.360" end="00:07:21.440" style="s2">articles at the time from when man stand</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.970" end="00:07:23.270" style="s2">was arrested in his trial very very few</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.440" end="00:07:25.820" style="s2">of the articles from that time will</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.270" end="00:07:28.700" style="s2">bring up the word cult at all usually</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.820" end="00:07:32.270" style="s2">they used the word ritual right</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.700" end="00:07:34.400" style="s2">ritualized murders or ritual killings to</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.270" end="00:07:41.030" style="s2">describe what happened with the Manson</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.400" end="00:07:43.760" style="s2">Family likewise when we look at Lifton&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.030" end="00:07:46.330" style="s2">work who I brought up last time he is</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.760" end="00:07:50.690" style="s2">the person that invented the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.330" end="00:07:52.840" style="s2">brainwashing and he created this by</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.690" end="00:07:57.110" style="s2">looking at the techniques of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.840" end="00:08:01.640" style="s2">Communist Chinese the Maoist movement</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.110" end="00:08:05.120" style="s2">and and that&#39;s where he got the entire</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.640" end="00:08:08.900" style="s2">idea of brainwashing so it very clearly</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.120" end="00:08:11.180" style="s2">starts as a political tool and we see</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.900" end="00:08:15.340" style="s2">this more obviously throughout all of</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.180" end="00:08:18.610" style="s2">the 20th century with sudden massive in</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.340" end="00:08:24.479" style="s2">influx of propaganda</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.610" end="00:08:24.479" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s you know extreme use by</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.069" end="00:08:36.550" style="s2">you know various political movements and</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.890" end="00:08:38.950" style="s2">then when you get to the 60s and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.550" end="00:08:42.610" style="s2">kind of free love movement and this</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.950" end="00:08:46.029" style="s2">sudden influx of what we&#39;re called new</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.610" end="00:08:49.300" style="s2">religious movements a lot of this being</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.029" end="00:08:51.279" style="s2">born from a massive influx of Eastern</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.300" end="00:08:55.029" style="s2">philosophy into the Western tradition</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.279" end="00:08:57.459" style="s2">that started and around the 20s that</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.029" end="00:09:00.130" style="s2">kind of peaked with the beatniks in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.459" end="00:09:02.860" style="s2">40s and 50s and then started becoming</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.130" end="00:09:09.430" style="s2">almost mainstream by the time you get to</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.860" end="00:09:15.220" style="s2">the hippies in the 60s basically people</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.430" end="00:09:18.610" style="s2">started in the 70s applying this word</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.220" end="00:09:22.089" style="s2">cult to understanding how these new</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.610" end="00:09:24.990" style="s2">religious movements were functioning and</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.089" end="00:09:28.589" style="s2">I actually think that if we were to pin</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.990" end="00:09:34.560" style="s2">the moment on when cult got its most</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.589" end="00:09:39.360" style="s2">pejorative use it was likely through the</p>

<p begin="00:09:39.360" end="00:09:44.320" style="s2">so when we think of the word cult</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.769" end="00:09:47.769" style="s2">we&#39;re probably calling back only as</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.320" end="00:09:49.990" style="s2">recently to the 80s where if people</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.769" end="00:09:54.279" style="s2">don&#39;t know there was a huge mass</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.990" end="00:09:57.640" style="s2">hysteria going on at the time of satanic</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.279" end="00:10:00.490" style="s2">ritual abuse cults and people you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.640" end="00:10:03.570" style="s2">like preschool teachers we&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.490" end="00:10:06.339" style="s2">you know brought into courts for</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.570" end="00:10:08.350" style="s2">paranoid parents believing that they</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.339" end="00:10:10.510" style="s2">were performing satanic rituals on their</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.350" end="00:10:12.820" style="s2">children it&#39;s really interesting if you</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.510" end="00:10:15.699" style="s2">look into it it was it was a type of</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.820" end="00:10:19.110" style="s2">memetic virus that went through the</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.699" end="00:10:23.330" style="s2">culture that seemed to have little</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.110" end="00:10:26.220" style="s2">actual bearing on the reality</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.330" end="00:10:28.740" style="s2">you know I&#39;m certain that there were as</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.220" end="00:10:32.070" style="s2">there always as many people doing very</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.740" end="00:10:34.290" style="s2">creepy shit in the background and so one</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.070" end="00:10:38.760" style="s2">could likely find examples of people</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.290" end="00:10:40.590" style="s2">doing creepy shit from that period but</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.760" end="00:10:44.330" style="s2">it was interesting in that it very much</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.590" end="00:10:46.950" style="s2">had this type of mass hysterical effect</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.330" end="00:10:48.570" style="s2">in mass historical events are also</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.950" end="00:10:50.490" style="s2">something I recommend looking into</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.570" end="00:10:55.260" style="s2">they&#39;re really interesting and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.490" end="00:11:00.180" style="s2">number of examples of them that go back</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.260" end="00:11:04.200" style="s2">quite far one infamous one I think from</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.180" end="00:11:07.950" style="s2">the Dark Ages being a case where a very</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.200" end="00:11:10.560" style="s2">large group of people suddenly started</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.950" end="00:11:14.130" style="s2">dancing and could not stop to the point</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.560" end="00:11:15.420" style="s2">that the people were dancing themselves</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.130" end="00:11:17.970" style="s2">to death</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.420" end="00:11:22.560" style="s2">quite literally dying from exhaustion in</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.970" end="00:11:24.390" style="s2">the middle of dancing really bizarre</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.560" end="00:11:29.580" style="s2">snoring but really interesting to look</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.390" end="00:11:32.580" style="s2">into my point here is is that when</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.580" end="00:11:34.830" style="s2">people try and make arguments like you</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.580" end="00:11:38.520" style="s2">know the word cult has always been used</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.830" end="00:11:41.250" style="s2">to form a healthy boundary around what</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.520" end="00:11:44.310" style="s2">is acceptable culture and what is not</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.250" end="00:11:45.000" style="s2">papers they are either lying or they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.310" end="00:11:54.480" style="s2">ignorant</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.000" end="00:11:57.000" style="s2">and have no understanding of likewise we</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.480" end="00:12:00.030" style="s2">actually there&#39;s several domains and we</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.000" end="00:12:02.970" style="s2">still use the word in a positive context</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.030" end="00:12:04.860" style="s2">most notable noticeably in art and</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.970" end="00:12:06.900" style="s2">entertainment right when we say</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.860" end="00:12:10.790" style="s2">something has a cult following or is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.900" end="00:12:12.660" style="s2">cult classic it does not carry its usual</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.790" end="00:12:16.019" style="s2">pejorative</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.660" end="00:12:28.160" style="s2">patient sorry my roommate is being very</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.019" end="00:12:31.139" style="s2">loud I can&#39;t I can&#39;t hear it okay so I</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.160" end="00:12:33.360" style="s2">think it&#39;s important also to realize</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.139" end="00:12:35.910" style="s2">that a lot of this kind of like sudden</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.360" end="00:12:40.709" style="s2">fear or of brainwashing that gets tied</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.910" end="00:12:43.829" style="s2">to cults is very distinctly a political</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.709" end="00:12:47.759" style="s2">one right it&#39;s it&#39;s distinctly political</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.829" end="00:12:50.519" style="s2">and then it gets dragged into religious</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.759" end="00:12:54.839" style="s2">and pseudo religious ideologies as time</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.519" end="00:12:56.910" style="s2">passes due to the similarities and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.839" end="00:13:00.629" style="s2">no coincidence I don&#39;t think that we see</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.910" end="00:13:04.800" style="s2">a sudden increase in the rise of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.629" end="00:13:07.139" style="s2">term cult distinctly at periods not</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.800" end="00:13:08.939" style="s2">where there was a lot of religious</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.139" end="00:13:13.230" style="s2">activity going on but where there was a</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.939" end="00:13:16.500" style="s2">lot of political activity going on so</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.230" end="00:13:20.370" style="s2">again right liftin writes his work to do</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.500" end="00:13:24.810" style="s2">literally as a counter against the</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.370" end="00:13:27.509" style="s2">growing communist fear right and and</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.810" end="00:13:32.730" style="s2">another well-known cult researcher</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.509" end="00:13:35.130" style="s2">Lolich the cult that she was in was</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.730" end="00:13:36.750" style="s2">distinctly a political one it had no</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.130" end="00:13:40.889" style="s2">religious ties at all it was the</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.750" end="00:13:46.560" style="s2">Democratic Workers Party or something</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.889" end="00:13:49.170" style="s2">like DWP here in America and it was</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.560" end="00:13:51.870" style="s2">after leaving that cult that she became</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.170" end="00:13:53.910" style="s2">a cult researcher and started applying</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.870" end="00:13:56.490" style="s2">you know what she had learned from her</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.910" end="00:13:58.639" style="s2">time in it to a broader sociological</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.490" end="00:13:58.639" style="s2">lens</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.339" end="00:14:07.809" style="s2">so we have to be pretty aware that that</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.389" end="00:14:11.290" style="s2">a lot of this a lot of its use often</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.809" end="00:14:14.889" style="s2">comes down to seemingly this attempt</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.290" end="00:14:18.220" style="s2">following World War two to try and</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.889" end="00:14:23.529" style="s2">totalize a culture when you have rules</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.220" end="00:14:29.620" style="s2">and laws like the freedom of speech and</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.529" end="00:14:34.870" style="s2">freedom of religious affiliation forget</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.620" end="00:14:37.540" style="s2">with the ring right you basically you</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.870" end="00:14:40.559" style="s2">start needing a way to control the</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.540" end="00:14:43.300" style="s2">Overton Window of your culture</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.559" end="00:14:46.269" style="s2">particularly in time very divisive times</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.300" end="00:14:51.779" style="s2">like following the World War two and</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.269" end="00:14:54.279" style="s2">during the Cold War such that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.779" end="00:14:58.870" style="s2">you&#39;re able to properly frame your</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.279" end="00:15:03.509" style="s2">country against an enemy without having</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.870" end="00:15:07.779" style="s2">the country split apart inside of itself</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.509" end="00:15:08.920" style="s2">so yes yes often when we&#39;re dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.779" end="00:15:10.629" style="s2">the word cult we&#39;re looking at a</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.920" end="00:15:13.540" style="s2">political a political tool that got</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.629" end="00:15:16.529" style="s2">repurposed for religious and although</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.540" end="00:15:20.889" style="s2">all of these ends seem to be very and</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.529" end="00:15:24.639" style="s2">primarily concerned with controlling the</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.889" end="00:15:27.819" style="s2">Overton Window and this may I&#39;ve not</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.639" end="00:15:30.490" style="s2">actually arguing against using a word of</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.819" end="00:15:32.860" style="s2">this way as I was mistaken in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.490" end="00:15:35.470" style="s2">previous conversation we do need</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.860" end="00:15:38.069" style="s2">normalizing terms and we need boundary</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.470" end="00:15:43.439" style="s2">condition terms those are both very</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.069" end="00:15:46.240" style="s2">useful things but I think it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.439" end="00:15:49.059" style="s2">important for us to remember exactly</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.240" end="00:15:52.360" style="s2">what the word is doing and likewise</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.059" end="00:15:56.230" style="s2">there comes a point where which I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.360" end="00:15:59.079" style="s2">we have long since passed now where that</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.230" end="00:16:02.259" style="s2">normative function can&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.079" end="00:16:04.929" style="s2">survive due to the internal tensions of</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.259" end="00:16:08.050" style="s2">the culture that we are in and I</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.929" end="00:16:11.049" style="s2">actually lay this quite quite distinctly</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.050" end="00:16:13.449" style="s2">at the feet of the meaning crisis so I</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.049" end="00:16:16.029" style="s2">would say that one aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.449" end="00:16:18.699" style="s2">meaning crisis and perhaps a postmark</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.029" end="00:16:22.419" style="s2">modernity in a more general sense is</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.699" end="00:16:26.259" style="s2">that it has a way of fractioning</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.419" end="00:16:28.569" style="s2">worldviews and removing the mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.259" end="00:16:31.989" style="s2">by which we hierarchically ordered</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.569" end="00:16:34.359" style="s2">worldviews such that everyone is already</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.989" end="00:16:36.790" style="s2">looking at everyone else in our current</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.359" end="00:16:40.809" style="s2">cultural situation as in as if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.790" end="00:16:42.489" style="s2">in a cult already right so the Atheist</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.809" end="00:16:44.049" style="s2">look at the Christians and think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.489" end="00:16:45.910" style="s2">in a cult the Christians look at the</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.049" end="00:16:47.859" style="s2">atheists and think they&#39;re in a cult the</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.910" end="00:16:48.879" style="s2">Democrats look at the Republicans and</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.859" end="00:16:51.100" style="s2">vice versa</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.879" end="00:16:54.749" style="s2">great everyone is already looking at</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.100" end="00:16:57.489" style="s2">everyone else by their ideological</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.749" end="00:17:00.189" style="s2">identification and then how that</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.489" end="00:17:02.799" style="s2">ideological identification doesn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.189" end="00:17:05.679" style="s2">stay as a ideology or a worldview inside</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.799" end="00:17:08.949" style="s2">that person&#39;s head but how it scales in</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.679" end="00:17:12.789" style="s2">the sociological systems that the person</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.949" end="00:17:16.360" style="s2">belongs to I would also say that part of</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.789" end="00:17:19.959" style="s2">what&#39;s driven our kind of conception in</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.360" end="00:17:24.730" style="s2">that direction is the massive rise of</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.959" end="00:17:28.840" style="s2">branding through the 20th century and</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.730" end="00:17:32.620" style="s2">again if you think what the word is</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.840" end="00:17:36.190" style="s2">right a brand is what a farmer would put</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.620" end="00:17:39.429" style="s2">on his animals so that people knew who</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.190" end="00:17:41.620" style="s2">the animal belonged to and I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.429" end="00:17:44.139" style="s2">it&#39;s a mistake that we use the word</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.620" end="00:17:47.049" style="s2">brand to describe the clothing we wear</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.139" end="00:17:51.789" style="s2">or how we walk around as literal free</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.049" end="00:17:53.889" style="s2">advertising space for companies and I</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.789" end="00:17:56.470" style="s2">think it&#39;s really important to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.889" end="00:17:59.230" style="s2">get a phenomenological understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.470" end="00:18:01.809" style="s2">what exactly is occurring when we wear a</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.230" end="00:18:05.190" style="s2">giant logo on our chest and then go out</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.809" end="00:18:07.510" style="s2">into the world and interact with others</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.190" end="00:18:12.100" style="s2">presenting ourselves in the armor of</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.510" end="00:18:18.000" style="s2">this larger symbol that represents a</p>

<p begin="00:19:39.560" end="00:19:48.850" style="s2">view branding as a very distinct but a</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.430" end="00:19:52.940" style="s2">very weak form of cultic affiliations</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.850" end="00:19:56.650" style="s2">and I think that this really starts to</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.940" end="00:19:59.030" style="s2">reach its peak when you see for instance</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.650" end="00:20:01.250" style="s2">you know it was a couple years ago</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.030" end="00:20:04.340" style="s2">Facebook was going I don&#39;t know if they</p>

<p begin="00:20:04.340" end="00:20:14.510" style="s2">launch a relationship I kind of like you</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.310" end="00:20:17.000" style="s2">know tinder or whatever maybe something</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.510" end="00:20:19.960" style="s2">less overtly sexual than tinder but a</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.000" end="00:20:23.390" style="s2">relationship mapping matching service</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.960" end="00:20:26.330" style="s2">through Facebook and the main mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.390" end="00:20:28.190" style="s2">that they used to decide I mean this was</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.330" end="00:20:30.770" style="s2">actually fairly genius both from an</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.190" end="00:20:33.920" style="s2">advertising standpoint and because it</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.770" end="00:20:36.200" style="s2">probably would have worked what they</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.920" end="00:20:39.170" style="s2">used as the metric for if two people</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.200" end="00:20:42.440" style="s2">would get along was the</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.170" end="00:20:45.740" style="s2">branded the brand pages that the person</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.440" end="00:20:48.320" style="s2">followed on Facebook so they kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.740" end="00:20:50.480" style="s2">double I double doubled the incentive</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.320" end="00:20:52.130" style="s2">here one as they made it so that people</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.480" end="00:20:54.080" style="s2">using the service would make sure to</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.130" end="00:20:56.540" style="s2">comb through all their favorite brand</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.080" end="00:20:58.700" style="s2">pages and like them which made</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.540" end="00:21:01.120" style="s2">advertising to the people easier with</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.700" end="00:21:03.830" style="s2">targeted ads through Facebook and</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.120" end="00:21:06.320" style="s2">likewise it it allowed them to have</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.830" end="00:21:08.690" style="s2">better matches by looking at the range</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.320" end="00:21:11.630" style="s2">of cultic affiliations that the person</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.690" end="00:21:14.030" style="s2">subscribed to and thus was able to match</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.630" end="00:21:16.880" style="s2">people across various groups based on</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.030" end="00:21:22.840" style="s2">their ideologies as communicated by</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.880" end="00:21:25.460" style="s2">whether they liked the supreme or not so</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.840" end="00:21:28.580" style="s2">one can get a pretty distinct sense here</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.460" end="00:21:31.640" style="s2">of how dystopic this type of thing can</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.580" end="00:21:36.200" style="s2">can be when it is unconscious and used</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.640" end="00:21:38.540" style="s2">against us and also how extremely useful</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.200" end="00:21:43.310" style="s2">and I would argue fundamental it is to</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.540" end="00:21:46.900" style="s2">our ability to train our heuristics in a</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.310" end="00:21:54.070" style="s2">society where you don&#39;t have a clear</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.900" end="00:21:54.070" style="s2">unified culture yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.929" end="00:21:58.740" style="s2">I&#39;ll take a quick break there before</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.000" end="00:22:04.320" style="s2">diving further into this and see if</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.740" end="00:22:06.720" style="s2">anyone has any questions what was a</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.320" end="00:22:09.540" style="s2">really good job Nick</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.720" end="00:22:14.640" style="s2">I was just gonna make a comment that was</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.540" end="00:22:19.650" style="s2">really good thank you so I was wondering</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.640" end="00:22:25.410" style="s2">so you made the point that that the term</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.650" end="00:22:27.720" style="s2">cult almost has a propagandist tint to</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.410" end="00:22:29.940" style="s2">it where the people didn&#39;t like these</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.720" end="00:22:31.530" style="s2">groups were using it for ative lee to</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.940" end="00:22:34.380" style="s2">brand them but you think we&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.530" end="00:22:38.850" style="s2">stuck with that negative that negative</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.380" end="00:22:42.299" style="s2">connotation to the word now kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.850" end="00:22:44.850" style="s2">again there are uses of it that are less</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.299" end="00:22:47.910" style="s2">pejorative although it&#39;s contextually</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.850" end="00:22:51.990" style="s2">based more so than anything the</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.910" end="00:22:54.210" style="s2">mechanism that I&#39;ve kind of gone for is</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.990" end="00:22:56.940" style="s2">not to actually appropriate the word</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.210" end="00:22:59.070" style="s2">cult itself although I do think that we</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.940" end="00:23:02.910" style="s2">need to be a little bit more comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.070" end="00:23:08.549" style="s2">with it particularly how it&#39;s being used</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.910" end="00:23:11.370" style="s2">now within our our culture what the the</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.549" end="00:23:13.500" style="s2">method I&#39;ve gone is rather to focus to</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.370" end="00:23:17.160" style="s2">turn it into an adjective rather than a</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.500" end="00:23:18.600" style="s2">noun so when I&#39;m trying to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.160" end="00:23:22.830" style="s2">the frame that I&#39;m trying to communicate</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.600" end="00:23:24.809" style="s2">here I&#39;ll point out the cultic nature of</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.830" end="00:23:28.679" style="s2">something right I&#39;ll say cultic</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.809" end="00:23:31.530" style="s2">structures or cultic affiliations rather</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.679" end="00:23:34.380" style="s2">than trying to stick the noun form on</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.530" end="00:23:36.630" style="s2">somebody and the point of that is to get</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.380" end="00:23:40.380" style="s2">them to kind of see the mechanisms by</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.630" end="00:23:43.020" style="s2">which their Association associative</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.380" end="00:23:45.450" style="s2">system is working right it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.020" end="00:23:50.340" style="s2">functioning on on the set of tools of</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.450" end="00:23:53.460" style="s2">like rational you know choice freewill</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.340" end="00:23:57.390" style="s2">based mechanisms it&#39;s largely based on</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.460" end="00:24:01.410" style="s2">these subconscious belief structures and</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.390" end="00:24:05.669" style="s2">heuristic systems that are embedded in</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.410" end="00:24:08.520" style="s2">our cognition and and the point of using</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.669" end="00:24:10.380" style="s2">it also to use the word cultic as</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.520" end="00:24:12.330" style="s2">opposed to another word is to try and</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.380" end="00:24:15.600" style="s2">get the person to break frame a little</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.330" end="00:24:17.790" style="s2">bit right so I wanna I want to make use</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.600" end="00:24:19.530" style="s2">of that negative connotation but I want</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.790" end="00:24:21.809" style="s2">to make use of it in a way that it</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.530" end="00:24:26.070" style="s2">reveals something to the person not</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.809" end="00:24:31.169" style="s2">punches them in the face with with you</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.070" end="00:24:33.150" style="s2">know an imagined insult so yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.169" end="00:24:35.130" style="s2">that&#39;s part of the argument for why I&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:26:45.870" end="00:26:49.950" style="s2">relationship meaningful are also the</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.850" end="00:26:52.580" style="s2">thing that makes it dangerous and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.950" end="00:26:56.070" style="s2">what it&#39;s allowed is a really robust</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.580" end="00:26:59.310" style="s2">study to come out where we&#39;re able to</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.070" end="00:27:01.770" style="s2">look at how these little bits happening</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.310" end="00:27:05.520" style="s2">these these largely subconscious and you</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.770" end="00:27:07.950" style="s2">know very detailed aspects play</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.520" end="00:27:10.650" style="s2">themselves out and we&#39;re able to more</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.950" end="00:27:13.410" style="s2">meaningfully categorize what a negative</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.650" end="00:27:15.720" style="s2">or a unhealthy relationship is and how</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.410" end="00:27:17.790" style="s2">one can work within the relationship and</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.720" end="00:27:19.860" style="s2">with a relationship to put it on a</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.790" end="00:27:23.070" style="s2">course toward something better and I</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.860" end="00:27:26.070" style="s2">think that is the same mechanism or the</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.070" end="00:27:28.710" style="s2">same the same lens we need to take when</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.070" end="00:27:31.490" style="s2">we talk about cults and cultic</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.710" end="00:27:34.610" style="s2">structures and I think it would actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.490" end="00:27:36.780" style="s2">enable a much more robust study of our</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.610" end="00:27:39.650" style="s2">sociological systems and how those</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.780" end="00:27:44.370" style="s2">sociological systems interact with our</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.650" end="00:27:46.490" style="s2">phenomenological reality so the four</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.370" end="00:27:51.980" style="s2">cults that you were a part of would you</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.490" end="00:27:57.990" style="s2">characterize them as unhealthy cults yes</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.980" end="00:28:00.030" style="s2">yes absolutely but again it&#39;s not as cut</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.990" end="00:28:01.800" style="s2">and dry as I would like to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.030" end="00:28:04.560" style="s2">make it so I brought this up in that</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.800" end="00:28:07.470" style="s2">first one with the Harry Krishna&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.560" end="00:28:09.870" style="s2">like me is a relatively healthy normal</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.470" end="00:28:14.100" style="s2">outsider coming in would go oh this is</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.870" end="00:28:17.040" style="s2">unhealthy but when I look at its ability</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.100" end="00:28:19.200" style="s2">to take people that would definitely be</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.040" end="00:28:22.520" style="s2">living on the street or would have died</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.200" end="00:28:27.150" style="s2">from a drug overdose or you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.520" end="00:28:27.980" style="s2">anything else like it did wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.150" end="00:28:30.410" style="s2">things for those</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.980" end="00:28:32.510" style="s2">people and they were living much better</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.410" end="00:28:36.140" style="s2">lives than they would have in any other</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.510" end="00:28:39.410" style="s2">circumstance so it&#39;s hard for me to just</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.140" end="00:28:41.270" style="s2">blank it give a blanket definition and</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.410" end="00:28:44.840" style="s2">say that was bullshit and all those</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.270" end="00:28:47.320" style="s2">people were being abused no was there a</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.840" end="00:28:51.320" style="s2">spate of abuse going on yes do you think</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.320" end="00:28:54.080" style="s2">all the people running those cults saw</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.320" end="00:28:57.110" style="s2">themselves as being good cults or do you</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.080" end="00:29:01.130" style="s2">think they knew something was off I I</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.110" end="00:29:03.290" style="s2">would say in all of the ones that I</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.130" end="00:29:06.160" style="s2">interacted with they absolutely thought</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.290" end="00:29:09.320" style="s2">that they were doing something good</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.160" end="00:29:11.390" style="s2">none of them none of the actors that I</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.320" end="00:29:15.230" style="s2">interacted with excepting cult 4</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.390" end="00:29:17.929" style="s2">although hope for is really hard to get</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.230" end="00:29:21.910" style="s2">a grip on because they inverted almost</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.929" end="00:29:24.350" style="s2">every expectation and and system for</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.910" end="00:29:28.640" style="s2">navigating these spaces that you could</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.350" end="00:29:31.040" style="s2">imagine so I&#39;d have to spend a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.640" end="00:29:33.710" style="s2">time figuring out what was going on or</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.040" end="00:29:35.990" style="s2">communicating what was going on there in</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.710" end="00:29:38.960" style="s2">the first three absolutely these people</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.990" end="00:29:41.600" style="s2">did not think and they had the noblest</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.960" end="00:29:43.460" style="s2">of intentions and in many cases they</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.600" end="00:29:46.669" style="s2">were able to successfully deliver on</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.460" end="00:29:49.429" style="s2">those noble intentions and and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.669" end="00:29:52.460" style="s2">it you know the funkiness came in from</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.429" end="00:29:54.770" style="s2">from the necessary faults of being a</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.460" end="00:29:57.640" style="s2">person and letting selfish desires</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.770" end="00:29:57.640" style="s2">slide in</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.660" end="00:30:05.120" style="s2">but they were not objectively</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.150" end="00:30:08.790" style="s2">manipulative they were not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.120" end="00:30:10.800" style="s2">manipulate again that you know aware of</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.790" end="00:30:14.340" style="s2">what they were doing I mean and this is</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.800" end="00:30:16.440" style="s2">common you know Jones from Jones town</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.340" end="00:30:28.440" style="s2">you know he kills himself with everyone</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.440" end="00:30:30.900" style="s2">else right right yeah did that answer</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.440" end="00:30:32.280" style="s2">the question yeah and I guess III think</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.900" end="00:30:34.740" style="s2">you may be coming to this but then so</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.280" end="00:30:37.050" style="s2">the the question the next question is</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.740" end="00:30:39.420" style="s2">therefore you know how do we how do we</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.050" end="00:30:41.840" style="s2">we have good intentions here how do we</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.420" end="00:30:46.530" style="s2">avoid becoming dubbing the bad cult</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.840" end="00:30:48.450" style="s2">right right and I I will get I will get</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.530" end="00:30:51.920" style="s2">into this where we yeah we got plenty of</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.450" end="00:30:56.570" style="s2">time I should be good on time this time</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.920" end="00:30:56.570" style="s2">any other questions at this stage</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.970" end="00:31:06.980" style="s2">all right I do it&#39;s just I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.610" end="00:31:08.750" style="s2">taking notes so there&#39;s just so much</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.980" end="00:31:12.320" style="s2">here and I really appreciate you going</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.750" end="00:31:15.049" style="s2">through us because it&#39;s a lot in terms</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.320" end="00:31:18.620" style="s2">of using the word and the definition</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.049" end="00:31:20.600" style="s2">changing over time do you see the</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.620" end="00:31:24.679" style="s2">definition changing again perhaps back</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.600" end="00:31:28.039" style="s2">to a more positive outlook yes and I</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.679" end="00:31:30.950" style="s2">think that this will largely come likely</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.039" end="00:31:33.500" style="s2">from when people finally realize that</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.950" end="00:31:37.759" style="s2">rather than defending themselves from</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.500" end="00:31:41.690" style="s2">the endless you know everyone calling</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.759" end="00:31:44.269" style="s2">each other the cult when they just give</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.690" end="00:31:46.639" style="s2">up trying to defend and say my things</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.269" end="00:31:48.919" style="s2">nautical your thing is a cult and they</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.639" end="00:31:53.299" style="s2">just go sure whatever it&#39;s a cult</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.919" end="00:31:56.539" style="s2">and when that happens I think it will in</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.299" end="00:32:00.409" style="s2">a very post ironic sense actually start</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.539" end="00:32:02.659" style="s2">to recover its its definition I would</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.409" end="00:32:05.240" style="s2">hope that by the time something like</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.659" end="00:32:08.210" style="s2">that happens there is actually some</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.240" end="00:32:11.750" style="s2">robust understanding of the mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.210" end="00:32:15.639" style="s2">at play because I think that could slide</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.750" end="00:32:15.639" style="s2">into hellish territory very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.690" end="00:32:23.780" style="s2">thank you yeah I&#39;m breaking the boundary</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.290" end="00:32:25.910" style="s2">to try and put up a better wall rather</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.780" end="00:32:28.960" style="s2">than breaking the boundary just to go</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.910" end="00:32:28.960" style="s2">look it&#39;s all the same</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.810" end="00:32:41.400" style="s2">all right let me get to my layout and</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.510" end="00:32:45.000" style="s2">see where I am</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.400" end="00:32:48.660" style="s2">so okay yeah let&#39;s go over two of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.000" end="00:32:52.140" style="s2">more common modern definitions of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.660" end="00:32:54.750" style="s2">word cult one is from Lolich and i</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.140" end="00:32:57.570" style="s2">forget where the other one was from but</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.750" end="00:33:08.430" style="s2">I&#39;m pretty sure I read it in Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.570" end="00:33:11.040" style="s2">Shaw&#39;s traumatic narcissism which is I I</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.430" end="00:33:13.950" style="s2">haven&#39;t read much of Locke&#39;s work but I</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.040" end="00:33:16.650" style="s2">have read most of Daniel Shaw&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.950" end="00:33:19.290" style="s2">traumatic narcissism it&#39;s a very useful</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.650" end="00:33:22.140" style="s2">book I recommend it I&#39;ll get into this</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.290" end="00:33:25.040" style="s2">later but I think it is actually way</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.140" end="00:33:29.370" style="s2">more useful to teach people about</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.040" end="00:33:32.040" style="s2">traumatic narcissism and to frame what</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.370" end="00:33:34.920" style="s2">we often complain about in cults or view</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.040" end="00:33:36.660" style="s2">as dangerous not in terms of cults but</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.920" end="00:33:40.700" style="s2">in terms of dealing with narcissistic</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.660" end="00:33:43.640" style="s2">personality disorder one because it</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.700" end="00:33:47.010" style="s2">reminds you of just how extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.640" end="00:33:49.470" style="s2">present narcissism is it gives you tools</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.010" end="00:33:51.540" style="s2">for dealing with it in any circumstance</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.470" end="00:33:54.210" style="s2">in which you may see it arise whether</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.540" end="00:33:56.760" style="s2">it&#39;s in a group setting or at a direct</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.210" end="00:34:01.380" style="s2">interpersonal setting and I think it it</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.760" end="00:34:06.090" style="s2">has a much better analysis than the work</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.380" end="00:34:08.190" style="s2">done on cults so far so that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.090" end="00:34:12.030" style="s2">recommended reading from me he was also</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.190" end="00:34:15.620" style="s2">in a cult a hidden do cult which is an</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.030" end="00:34:15.620" style="s2">interesting side topic</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.429" end="00:34:24.120" style="s2">yeah so starting with Lex definition and</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.810" end="00:34:33.419" style="s2">we&#39;ll really be able to see how this</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.120" end="00:34:35.250" style="s2">falls apart at least I think sorry I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.419" end="00:34:37.820" style="s2">trying to find where I&#39;ve written the</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.250" end="00:34:37.820" style="s2">definition</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.240" end="00:34:47.970" style="s2">oh you know what I did not copy and</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.480" end="00:34:50.810" style="s2">paste it into this box sorry give me</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.970" end="00:34:50.810" style="s2">just a second</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.600" end="00:35:00.610" style="s2">right so we&#39;ll play with two definitions</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.670" end="00:35:04.780" style="s2">one is from right here off of Lex</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.610" end="00:35:07.780" style="s2">website hope research a cult can be</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.780" end="00:35:10.840" style="s2">either a sharply bounded social group or</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.780" end="00:35:12.880" style="s2">a diffusely bounded social movement held</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.840" end="00:35:15.730" style="s2">together through shared commitment to a</p>

<p begin="00:37:34.110" end="00:37:38.220" style="s2">actually found useful because I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.700" end="00:37:40.320" style="s2">adding an adjective in front of the word</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.220" end="00:37:43.740" style="s2">cults is probably the most useful way to</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.320" end="00:37:45.750" style="s2">go about it so write describing what</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.740" end="00:37:48.570" style="s2">type of cultic structure it is right is</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.750" end="00:37:54.750" style="s2">it totalistic is it authoritarian is it</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.570" end="00:37:57.210" style="s2">narcissistic some mixture of these but</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.750" end="00:38:00.090" style="s2">as hopefully you could you could pick up</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.210" end="00:38:04.080" style="s2">on on reading that one her definition</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.090" end="00:38:07.050" style="s2">slips multiple times so the way she</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.080" end="00:38:11.160" style="s2">defines it at one point runs counter to</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.050" end="00:38:13.140" style="s2">the way she defines it later and the</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.160" end="00:38:15.240" style="s2">other problem actually comes up when I</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.140" end="00:38:23.010" style="s2">did a little further research on her</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.240" end="00:38:26.130" style="s2">definition of charismatic and her</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.010" end="00:38:28.470" style="s2">definition of charismatic actually has</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.130" end="00:38:32.670" style="s2">nothing at all to do with a charismatic</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.470" end="00:38:38.690" style="s2">leader rather she defines charisma as a</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.670" end="00:38:42.480" style="s2">response in the recipient such that a</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.690" end="00:38:47.000" style="s2">leader is a charismatic leader so long</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.480" end="00:38:49.680" style="s2">as someone finds him to be charismatic</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.000" end="00:38:51.450" style="s2">now you can see why she made this move</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.680" end="00:38:54.810" style="s2">because one the move away from</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.450" end="00:38:59.130" style="s2">essentialism is very popular nowadays</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.810" end="00:39:00.750" style="s2">and two because essentialism in this</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.130" end="00:39:02.510" style="s2">case being that the leader has some</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.750" end="00:39:04.490" style="s2">quality that makes him cares man</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.510" end="00:39:08.960" style="s2">and to because you have to deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.490" end="00:39:11.390" style="s2">very real problem that right certain</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.960" end="00:39:15.020" style="s2">figures that some find charismatic</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.390" end="00:39:16.700" style="s2">others find actively repelling and so</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.020" end="00:39:18.530" style="s2">you need some way to figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.700" end="00:39:21.350" style="s2">exactly the word charisma is supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.530" end="00:39:23.660" style="s2">be pointing to my contention would be</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.350" end="00:39:26.869" style="s2">that within a secular context the word</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.660" end="00:39:28.490" style="s2">charisma means absolutely nothing if you</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.869" end="00:39:30.440" style="s2">look into the etymology of the word</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.490" end="00:39:34.300" style="s2">charisma it comes straight out of</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.440" end="00:39:37.310" style="s2">Christianity in the form of terrorism</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.300" end="00:39:41.570" style="s2">the plural plural of which was Cara&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.310" end="00:39:45.080" style="s2">Matta and literally means a gift from</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.570" end="00:39:48.020" style="s2">God so the person has some gift given to</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.080" end="00:39:49.970" style="s2">them by God that makes them very</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.020" end="00:39:55.240" style="s2">proficient beyond the level of normal</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.970" end="00:39:58.550" style="s2">human achievement in a secular context</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.240" end="00:40:02.359" style="s2">all it means is that a person is able to</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.550" end="00:40:04.280" style="s2">convince somebody else of something and</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.359" end="00:40:06.530" style="s2">I think that&#39;s probably a more useful</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.280" end="00:40:08.359" style="s2">way to go about it than trying to deal</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.530" end="00:40:11.359" style="s2">with the word charisma within the</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.359" end="00:40:13.550" style="s2">context these people are using it so</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.359" end="00:40:16.850" style="s2">right and I think we can also have much</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.550" end="00:40:20.540" style="s2">stronger mechanisms by which we can</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.850" end="00:40:24.710" style="s2">define how a person may be convincing</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.540" end="00:40:28.100" style="s2">and it helps us move away from the naive</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.710" end="00:40:30.590" style="s2">assumption that a cult leader has to act</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.100" end="00:40:33.470" style="s2">like Tony Robbins in order to be very</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.590" end="00:40:37.930" style="s2">effective at what he does I would argue</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.470" end="00:40:40.160" style="s2">right a person can be deeply not</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.930" end="00:40:42.380" style="s2">charismatic in the traditional sense of</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.160" end="00:40:45.740" style="s2">the word and can still form a very</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.380" end="00:40:49.780" style="s2">strong following only because they make</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.740" end="00:40:49.780" style="s2">very convincing arguments for example</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.030" end="00:40:53.930" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.630" end="00:40:59.790" style="s2">so so there&#39;s that&#39;s a major problem</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.030" end="00:41:03.780" style="s2">with this is that when when you define</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.790" end="00:41:07.230" style="s2">what a cult is based on what someone who</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.780" end="00:41:09.870" style="s2">listens to it responds you end up in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.230" end="00:41:12.960" style="s2">situation where anyone can rightfully</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.870" end="00:41:15.990" style="s2">call anything a cult so long as they can</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.960" end="00:41:21.120" style="s2">find some person that treats it as if it</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.990" end="00:41:24.090" style="s2">is one the other problem is that the</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.120" end="00:41:27.090" style="s2">definition they give is so mushy</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.090" end="00:41:30.840" style="s2">in one sense that it becomes really hard</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.090" end="00:41:33.320" style="s2">to not describe many totally normal</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.840" end="00:41:37.290" style="s2">social systems as cults</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.320" end="00:41:41.790" style="s2">despite their really weak attempt here</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.290" end="00:41:44.610" style="s2">to to separate them by just saying it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.790" end="00:41:46.770" style="s2">not an intentional community because an</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.610" end="00:41:49.380" style="s2">intentional communities called Lehman in</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.770" end="00:41:54.870" style="s2">an intentional community and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.380" end="00:41:56.660" style="s2">called a cult I should also point out</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.870" end="00:42:01.830" style="s2">cult number two that I came across</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.660" end="00:42:05.030" style="s2">cinder land the one that was building an</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.830" end="00:42:09.360" style="s2">ark to sail to Machu Picchu upon the</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.030" end="00:42:11.370" style="s2">ocean rise from global warming it was an</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.360" end="00:42:14.420" style="s2">intentional community specifically an</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.370" end="00:42:18.000" style="s2">eco village and was not at all a cult</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.420" end="00:42:20.130" style="s2">and was at the time I was there lacking</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.000" end="00:42:24.300" style="s2">its charismatic leader so I guess it was</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.130" end="00:42:25.650" style="s2">not a cult by this definition which is</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.300" end="00:42:29.040" style="s2">the other problem with this definition</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.650" end="00:42:33.420" style="s2">is that it fails to recognize that many</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.040" end="00:42:36.090" style="s2">of the qualities that we most that are</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.420" end="00:42:39.000" style="s2">most dangerous about cults have</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.090" end="00:42:41.400" style="s2">absolutely nothing to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.000" end="00:42:46.860" style="s2">specific qualities that they pointed out</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.400" end="00:42:49.440" style="s2">in this definition so right many very</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.860" end="00:42:52.170" style="s2">deeply manipulative groups exist that do</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.440" end="00:42:56.370" style="s2">not have a clear single leader that acts</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.170" end="00:42:59.280" style="s2">as a lightning rod for the group you can</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.370" end="00:43:01.470" style="s2">see extreme systems of subjugation and</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.280" end="00:43:04.130" style="s2">abuse within a system where people are</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.470" end="00:43:07.290" style="s2">not obviously lined up behind</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.130" end="00:43:10.860" style="s2">and instead you can see it largely</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.290" end="00:43:14.220" style="s2">waited on a distinctly bureaucratic</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.860" end="00:43:20.160" style="s2">system and in many ways this gets into</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.220" end="00:43:22.440" style="s2">the the work of Ghent which Emmanuel</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.160" end="00:43:25.620" style="s2">Ghent which I brought up last time in</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.440" end="00:43:27.600" style="s2">his difference between surrender I think</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.620" end="00:43:32.130" style="s2">I brought it up last time surrender and</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.600" end="00:43:35.130" style="s2">subjugation he makes the point that</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.130" end="00:43:37.640" style="s2">subjugation as a deeply dehumanizing</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.130" end="00:43:39.630" style="s2">element to it and I would argue that</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.640" end="00:43:44.460" style="s2">bureaucracies are actually far more</p>

<p begin="00:43:57.480" end="00:44:04.050" style="s2">box so my biggest criticism here is that</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.620" end="00:44:06.510" style="s2">one this definition is not very strong</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.050" end="00:44:10.320" style="s2">it kind of suffers from two main</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.510" end="00:44:14.670" style="s2">problems one it overly scales and two it</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.320" end="00:44:19.050" style="s2">underly scales so it does it in weird</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.670" end="00:44:24.210" style="s2">dimensions such that it&#39;s losing a lot</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.050" end="00:44:26.750" style="s2">of its actual use as a term and I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.210" end="00:44:28.710" style="s2">that this is in some sense deeply</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.750" end="00:44:32.160" style="s2">fundamental to the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.710" end="00:44:35.190" style="s2">meaningfully defining what a cult is in</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.160" end="00:44:38.340" style="s2">in these very limited terms or limited</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.190" end="00:44:44.990" style="s2">scope which is that you end up doing</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.340" end="00:44:47.480" style="s2">quite a tremendous amount of nonsensical</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.990" end="00:44:50.910" style="s2">rationalizing in order to describe</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.480" end="00:44:56.370" style="s2">normal healthy sociological systems as</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.910" end="00:45:00.950" style="s2">not cults and likewise describing really</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.370" end="00:45:03.240" style="s2">damaging bureaucratic systems as cults</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.950" end="00:45:06.360" style="s2">you&#39;ll end up tearing your own</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.240" end="00:45:10.070" style="s2">definition apart in the effort to fit it</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.360" end="00:45:10.070" style="s2">within the category in that way</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.170" end="00:45:15.640" style="s2">cool yeah so that was a bit of a rant</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.650" end="00:45:23.240" style="s2">one of the stronger arguments that I</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.319" end="00:45:27.140" style="s2">came across and again I think this was</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.240" end="00:45:29.650" style="s2">from Shaw this this more leans on the on</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.140" end="00:45:33.410" style="s2">the argument that a cult is necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.650" end="00:45:36.260" style="s2">authoritarian and the way he defined it</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.410" end="00:45:38.390" style="s2">is that within a cultic structure the</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.260" end="00:45:41.809" style="s2">highest authority within that structure</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.390" end="00:45:45.619" style="s2">has no higher authority above them or</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.809" end="00:45:51.710" style="s2">otherwise lacks some mechanism of checks</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.619" end="00:45:54.079" style="s2">and balances so by that definition right</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.710" end="00:45:59.660" style="s2">Hitler and Nazi Germany was a cult</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.079" end="00:46:03.170" style="s2">leader kim jeong-hoon or ill hoon and</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.660" end="00:46:05.690" style="s2">then ill our cult leaders because they</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.170" end="00:46:08.329" style="s2">do not have a higher legal authority and</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.690" end="00:46:10.640" style="s2">neither do they have meaningful checks</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.329" end="00:46:13.579" style="s2">and balances systems within their</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.640" end="00:46:16.880" style="s2">government to rein in their power if it</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.579" end="00:46:20.599" style="s2">starts going out of control arguably</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.880" end="00:46:23.470" style="s2">this is the main critique of Western</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.599" end="00:46:26.089" style="s2">countries over communism is that it is</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.470" end="00:46:29.079" style="s2">fundamentally cultic because it loses</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.089" end="00:46:31.700" style="s2">the mechanism to rein in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.079" end="00:46:34.069" style="s2">authoritarian spouts work once he has</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.700" end="00:46:37.450" style="s2">been granted it for the sake of</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.069" end="00:46:37.450" style="s2">restructuring society</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.490" end="00:46:49.150" style="s2">and I think that this is arguably a a</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.140" end="00:46:51.990" style="s2">much stronger way to define what a</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.150" end="00:46:56.619" style="s2">cultic system is than Alec&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.990" end="00:47:00.040" style="s2">work here however I think it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.619" end="00:47:04.600" style="s2">likewise suffers from from some problems</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.040" end="00:47:10.780" style="s2">in that again just because a system has</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.600" end="00:47:13.540" style="s2">checks and balances or has a right a</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.780" end="00:47:15.670" style="s2">group of people that are able to debate</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.540" end="00:47:18.760" style="s2">with each other at the highest level of</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.670" end="00:47:22.510" style="s2">its authority does not actually mean</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.760" end="00:47:26.590" style="s2">that the system is going to not produce</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.510" end="00:47:29.320" style="s2">the exact same types of authoritarian</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.590" end="00:47:32.470" style="s2">structures it just can do so through</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.320" end="00:47:35.110" style="s2">different mechanisms in my framing I</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.470" end="00:47:37.780" style="s2">would argue that a system with really</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.110" end="00:47:40.030" style="s2">distinct checks and balances is part of</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.780" end="00:47:43.410" style="s2">what makes a healthy cult as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.030" end="00:47:46.240" style="s2">is what makes something not a cult and</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.410" end="00:47:48.700" style="s2">again I I make that move to try and</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.240" end="00:47:50.890" style="s2">recognize that checks and balances in</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.700" end="00:47:57.190" style="s2">and of themselves are not enough to make</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.890" end="00:48:03.369" style="s2">sure that a system remains healthy or</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.190" end="00:48:05.500" style="s2">non non abusive to its members so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.369" end="00:48:07.240" style="s2">probably the most contentious part of</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.500" end="00:48:10.990" style="s2">what I&#39;m going to say here going through</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.240" end="00:48:13.060" style="s2">the definitions and redefining through</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.990" end="00:48:15.130" style="s2">this system so this is probably a good</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.060" end="00:48:16.690" style="s2">spot again to stop and ask if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.130" end="00:48:19.570" style="s2">any questions or any people that would</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.690" end="00:48:22.859" style="s2">like to push back or wonder it why I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.570" end="00:48:22.859" style="s2">making the moves I&#39;m making</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.619" end="00:48:35.150" style="s2">I have a question please um the question</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.990" end="00:48:37.010" style="s2">is does the court of King Arthur oh the</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.150" end="00:48:41.690" style="s2">archetypical wise King</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.010" end="00:48:45.109" style="s2">laughs I as a cult and is in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.690" end="00:48:47.510" style="s2">the notion of a cult and up with that</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.109" end="00:48:51.530" style="s2">which is pernicious as opposed to that</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.510" end="00:48:54.170" style="s2">which is isin in release salutary even</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.530" end="00:49:01.460" style="s2">if it corresponds to all the same can</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.170" end="00:49:04.550" style="s2">exceed blade out I mean it certainly has</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.460" end="00:49:08.510" style="s2">the connotation I think it would be</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.550" end="00:49:11.450" style="s2">tremendously useful to if not be able to</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.510" end="00:49:14.599" style="s2">recover the word in a meaningful way to</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.450" end="00:49:20.480" style="s2">at least recover it as a description of</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.599" end="00:49:22.940" style="s2">our social sociology sociology and in</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.480" end="00:49:26.450" style="s2">the later half here I want to get more</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.940" end="00:49:29.750" style="s2">into what these elements are that make</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.450" end="00:49:32.720" style="s2">up these cultic structures how they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.750" end="00:49:36.410" style="s2">healthy useful right in the case of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.720" end="00:49:38.869" style="s2">wise King if you will or can be and how</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.410" end="00:49:41.060" style="s2">those same aspects can be used against</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.869" end="00:49:44.990" style="s2">us for the sake of manipulation or for</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.060" end="00:49:48.770" style="s2">the satisfaction of some persons you</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.990" end="00:49:52.210" style="s2">know narcissistic impulse kind of like a</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.770" end="00:49:56.550" style="s2">technology dual use which be salutary</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.210" end="00:49:58.789" style="s2">into abuse right</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.550" end="00:50:01.999" style="s2">as much</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.789" end="00:50:03.769" style="s2">I think I get what I think I get the</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.999" end="00:50:06.979" style="s2">gist of how you&#39;re redefining it but I</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.769" end="00:50:08.900" style="s2">also wonder is there some utility in</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.979" end="00:50:12.039" style="s2">keeping the definition to sort of these</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.900" end="00:50:14.539" style="s2">small smallish groups with a</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.039" end="00:50:17.509" style="s2">quote-unquote charismatic leader who I</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.539" end="00:50:19.160" style="s2">know I mean I see charismatic is more</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.509" end="00:50:21.380" style="s2">than just you can convince anyone but</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.160" end="00:50:23.809" style="s2">sort of somebody with a particular gift</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.380" end="00:50:25.669" style="s2">of the gab who doesn&#39;t have to have</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.809" end="00:50:27.349" style="s2">great arguments or whatnot to convince</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.669" end="00:50:30.589" style="s2">people it&#39;s just through force of</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.349" end="00:50:32.029" style="s2">personality and and that they&#39;re and</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.589" end="00:50:35.390" style="s2">that they have sort of almost a</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.029" end="00:50:37.579" style="s2">mesmerizing type of hold on on their</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.390" end="00:50:39.499" style="s2">people that seems to be a utility in</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.579" end="00:50:41.599" style="s2">having a word that describes that type</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.499" end="00:50:44.390" style="s2">of group rather than a definition that</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.599" end="00:50:49.089" style="s2">could include governments you know you</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.390" end="00:50:54.499" style="s2">know of entire countries that that so</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.089" end="00:50:56.809" style="s2">Lolich is i by their own definition the</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.499" end="00:50:59.059" style="s2">definition that you just gave of cults</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.809" end="00:51:03.439" style="s2">is not in any way the definition of</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.059" end="00:51:07.189" style="s2">cults they explicitly called North Korea</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.439" end="00:51:11.059" style="s2">a cult they make it very clear that</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.189" end="00:51:13.789" style="s2">there is not in any way a limit on size</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.059" end="00:51:21.079" style="s2">as to what constitutes a cult and what</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.789" end="00:51:22.880" style="s2">does not so we could create or redefine</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.079" end="00:51:26.029" style="s2">the word cult from a scholarly</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.880" end="00:51:29.329" style="s2">standpoint to distinctly talk about</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.029" end="00:51:31.909" style="s2">groups of less than a thousand people or</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.329" end="00:51:38.689" style="s2">or 500 again it just starts to become</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.909" end="00:51:40.999" style="s2">really arbitrary so yeah likewise I</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.689" end="00:51:43.159" style="s2">would say that the gift of the gab or</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.999" end="00:51:46.789" style="s2">say like what&#39;s often contained in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.159" end="00:51:49.159" style="s2">word sophist right a person that can</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.789" end="00:51:51.349" style="s2">make an argument convincing based on the</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.159" end="00:51:55.819" style="s2">force of their personality rather than</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.349" end="00:51:58.609" style="s2">on the efficacy of the argument the way</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.819" end="00:52:00.829" style="s2">I&#39;ve dealt with this is again making</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.609" end="00:52:02.959" style="s2">perhaps a similar type of move that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.829" end="00:52:06.409" style="s2">making right now which is that people</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.959" end="00:52:10.159" style="s2">can be convinced on using any number of</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.409" end="00:52:12.100" style="s2">channels the interpersonal channel is</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.159" end="00:52:14.830" style="s2">definitely one that can be</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.100" end="00:52:18.610" style="s2">use of and abused to convince something</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.830" end="00:52:20.440" style="s2">or someone of something regardless of</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.610" end="00:52:22.870" style="s2">whether it&#39;s a good argument or not so I</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.440" end="00:52:25.750" style="s2">agree that there is definitely utility</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.870" end="00:52:29.770" style="s2">in making sure we are deeply aware of</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.750" end="00:52:32.740" style="s2">that type of ability to convince it</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.770" end="00:52:36.940" style="s2">maybe even totally appropriate to title</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.740" end="00:52:39.670" style="s2">it with the term charisma my point is</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.940" end="00:52:43.000" style="s2">more that when we are speaking about</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.670" end="00:52:46.560" style="s2">these cultic groups if we define it only</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.000" end="00:52:51.940" style="s2">in terms of charisma you&#39;re gonna miss a</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.560" end="00:52:54.720" style="s2">huge swathe of deeply abusive systems of</p>

<p begin="00:53:40.290" end="00:53:46.200" style="s2">a matter of degree in some sense a cult</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.890" end="00:53:50.790" style="s2">following is to imply a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.200" end="00:53:52.890" style="s2">further cult seemed to imply a fervor</p>

<p begin="00:53:58.920" end="00:54:03.240" style="s2">as a cult doesn&#39;t actually amps with the</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.990" end="00:54:04.380" style="s2">definition because people like yeah I&#39;d</p>

<p begin="00:54:21.869" end="00:54:27.510" style="s2">yeah this is a cult right although what</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.530" end="00:54:30.780" style="s2">I would be so I think there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.510" end="00:54:32.099" style="s2">potential ways to error by by defining</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.780" end="00:54:38.010" style="s2">it that way</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.099" end="00:54:40.770" style="s2">one is is a hypo and one is hyper so one</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.010" end="00:54:44.040" style="s2">you have the problem then that the only</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.770" end="00:54:45.869" style="s2">way for you to be not cultic is to not</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.040" end="00:54:49.049" style="s2">give a shit about anything that you do</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.869" end="00:54:51.059" style="s2">in your life right so that&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.049" end="00:54:53.880" style="s2">coolness right you should never be</p>

<p begin="00:54:53.880" end="00:54:58.740" style="s2">that you&#39;re doing and that&#39;s how you</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.470" end="00:55:01.619" style="s2">avoid ever enter being called a cult</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.740" end="00:55:04.200" style="s2">member now well there&#39;s probably some</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.619" end="00:55:06.180" style="s2">wisdom to that right we should have some</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.200" end="00:55:08.549" style="s2">amount of restraint to how we interact</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.180" end="00:55:11.190" style="s2">with the system&#39;s it can also I think</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.549" end="00:55:13.589" style="s2">lead towards a nihilistic world view</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.190" end="00:55:15.790" style="s2">where coolness is the highest factor and</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.589" end="00:55:18.730" style="s2">that&#39;s my ability to be dis</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.790" end="00:55:22.540" style="s2">passionate becomes defined as what makes</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.730" end="00:55:24.670" style="s2">me a worthy or worthwhile person so that</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.540" end="00:55:27.400" style="s2">would be one negative potential I see</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.670" end="00:55:32.290" style="s2">from defining it in such a way the other</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.400" end="00:55:34.900" style="s2">is in the fact that if we define it in</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.290" end="00:55:39.220" style="s2">that way than anyone excited about</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.900" end="00:55:41.560" style="s2">anything we could call then we could say</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.220" end="00:55:43.660" style="s2">that there then belonging to a cult I</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.560" end="00:55:45.370" style="s2">don&#39;t say I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.660" end="00:55:47.620" style="s2">sufficient condition I&#39;m saying it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.370" end="00:55:48.720" style="s2">necessary condition oh I&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.620" end="00:55:51.430" style="s2">hey if you&#39;re if you&#39;re enthusiastic</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.720" end="00:55:54.670" style="s2">here in some kind of cult ciao</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.430" end="00:55:56.800" style="s2">oh I&#39;m just saying like it&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.670" end="00:55:58.570" style="s2">difficult to find a group of people who</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.800" end="00:55:59.620" style="s2">were like disinclined to like really</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.570" end="00:56:01.810" style="s2">defended you</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.620" end="00:56:03.610" style="s2">Confederate around the view - right</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.810" end="00:56:05.110" style="s2">Federer around the leader and saying you</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.610" end="00:56:07.510" style="s2">guys were in a cult they&#39;d be like what</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.110" end="00:56:09.580" style="s2">just a friend he just knows these</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.510" end="00:56:11.560" style="s2">mountains best so we follow him because</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.580" end="00:56:14.470" style="s2">he&#39;s already have a fuckin thing right</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.560" end="00:56:16.270" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s fair and I</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.470" end="00:56:17.230" style="s2">don&#39;t have anything distinctly against</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.270" end="00:56:20.430" style="s2">that again</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.230" end="00:56:23.440" style="s2">I might make arguments where it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.430" end="00:56:25.480" style="s2">in some sense you don&#39;t even need to</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.440" end="00:56:27.640" style="s2">deeply be Confederated around an</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.480" end="00:56:30.100" style="s2">ideology in order for many of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.640" end="00:56:33.130" style="s2">aspects of cultic systems to be at play</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.100" end="00:56:38.320" style="s2">so it can be just very close friendships</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.130" end="00:56:41.890" style="s2">with with a group of people or something</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.320" end="00:56:43.690" style="s2">along those lines so there&#39;s I think</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.890" end="00:56:47.890" style="s2">you&#39;re I think you&#39;re making a good</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.690" end="00:56:51.670" style="s2">point there and then it may be that we</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.890" end="00:56:56.380" style="s2">need another type of lens to view with</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.670" end="00:56:58.030" style="s2">how those other interpersonal sub mostly</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.380" end="00:57:00.100" style="s2">subconscious effects still have an</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.030" end="00:57:03.970" style="s2">impact on us Brett would you mute please</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.100" end="00:57:06.690" style="s2">oh sorry sorry I thought it was again</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.970" end="00:57:08.820" style="s2">Nick that was it thank you</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.690" end="00:57:10.440" style="s2">nikka I kind of missed that because</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.820" end="00:57:12.420" style="s2">Brett was speaking would you mind</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.440" end="00:57:14.490" style="s2">repeating your answer you said um that</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.420" end="00:57:15.990" style="s2">you thought he was making another good</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.490" end="00:57:20.250" style="s2">point in that we need another type of</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.990" end="00:57:22.520" style="s2">lens right I was saying insofar as is</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.250" end="00:57:24.570" style="s2">that is a good point which I I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.520" end="00:57:27.200" style="s2">definitely willing to concede there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.570" end="00:57:31.140" style="s2">something to what he&#39;s saying there I</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.200" end="00:57:33.390" style="s2">think what can we would in order to hold</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.140" end="00:57:37.320" style="s2">that point up strongly and still have a</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.390" end="00:57:39.510" style="s2">robust lens for understanding how social</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.320" end="00:57:43.500" style="s2">effects can take place outside of</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.510" end="00:57:45.840" style="s2">ideological social structures so just in</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.500" end="00:57:47.910" style="s2">the case of being part of a group of</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.840" end="00:57:53.450" style="s2">friends that aren&#39;t United around</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.910" end="00:57:58.860" style="s2">perhaps any activity fervor with fervor</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.450" end="00:58:02.010" style="s2">how we can still heavily be kind of put</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.860" end="00:58:04.770" style="s2">at the whim at how that social group</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.010" end="00:58:07.560" style="s2">operates so if we don&#39;t want to use a</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.770" end="00:58:10.530" style="s2">cultic lens in that case because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.560" end="00:58:13.740" style="s2">not based around an ideology or even a</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.530" end="00:58:16.380" style="s2">certain fervor we would need some way to</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.740" end="00:58:21.380" style="s2">look at how groups of people can impact</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.380" end="00:58:25.070" style="s2">our phenomenology using sociological</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.380" end="00:58:25.070" style="s2">systems or tools</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.500" end="00:58:35.760" style="s2">I would do so using a cultic lens</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.250" end="00:58:38.940" style="s2">because I think it captures a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.760" end="00:58:40.680" style="s2">stuff and gives us a robust lens but I</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.940" end="00:58:43.200" style="s2">think if we were to make that that</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.680" end="00:58:45.420" style="s2">delineation we would need some other</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.200" end="00:58:50.760" style="s2">kind of little tool set to deal with in</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.420" end="00:58:52.350" style="s2">those those other environments just kind</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.760" end="00:58:54.000" style="s2">of step away for a minute but please</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.350" end="00:58:55.560" style="s2">keep on talking and I just have some</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.000" end="00:58:58.200" style="s2">children issues sorry I thought I was</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.560" end="00:59:02.240" style="s2">needed before but I&#39;ll I&#39;ll be back so</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.200" end="00:59:02.240" style="s2">I&#39;m listening but so keep on going</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.160" end="00:59:18.150" style="s2">anyone else or should I continue I have</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.350" end="00:59:21.060" style="s2">a quick question well perhaps not quick</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.150" end="00:59:23.790" style="s2">but maybe um just for times sake</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.060" end="00:59:25.530" style="s2">so you said what makes a healthy cult</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.790" end="00:59:27.120" style="s2">potentially as checks-and-balances yet</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.530" end="00:59:31.410" style="s2">you said it&#39;s it&#39;s not enough for a</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.120" end="00:59:33.720" style="s2">system to remain healthy not abusive so</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.410" end="00:59:35.910" style="s2">what part of checks and balances is good</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.720" end="00:59:39.210" style="s2">enough and what part of it is not good</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.910" end="00:59:41.250" style="s2">enough well I would say that checks and</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.210" end="00:59:44.340" style="s2">balances offer a security mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.250" end="00:59:45.960" style="s2">right they they have a corrective</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.340" end="00:59:49.050" style="s2">mechanism that would otherwise be</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.960" end="00:59:51.240" style="s2">missing however just because that</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.050" end="00:59:55.380" style="s2">corrective mechanism exists does not</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.240" end="00:59:59.520" style="s2">mean that there doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.380" end="01:00:03.180" style="s2">correcting along the correct path if you</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.520" end="01:00:06.450" style="s2">will I would say that it also has sort</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.180" end="01:00:08.780" style="s2">of a prophylactic property to it as well</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.450" end="01:00:11.100" style="s2">because if those systems are in place</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.780" end="01:00:14.700" style="s2">actors within the system will tend to</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.100" end="01:00:16.530" style="s2">behave differently now right we&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.700" end="01:00:20.990" style="s2">Lee right being for a time a different</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.530" end="01:00:24.210" style="s2">way yes although what it can also allow</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.990" end="01:00:26.730" style="s2">much sneakier forms of manipulation</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.210" end="01:00:28.380" style="s2">because people think they&#39;re in a system</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.730" end="01:00:30.810" style="s2">with checks and balances and those</p>

<p begin="01:00:30.810" end="01:00:35.430" style="s2">according to the rules but they think</p>

<p begin="01:00:35.430" end="01:00:41.160" style="s2">right so this might be something like</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.309" end="01:00:43.319" style="s2">paying out you know classic forms of</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.160" end="01:00:47.130" style="s2">corruption in systems that have checks</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.319" end="01:00:52.559" style="s2">and balances of the blue check box and</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.130" end="01:00:59.579" style="s2">there&#39;s an exam right nice check and</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.559" end="01:01:01.950" style="s2">balance system but right yeah yeah in</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.579" end="01:01:04.499" style="s2">some sense checks and balances allow us</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.950" end="01:01:07.589" style="s2">some level of correction and that&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.499" end="01:01:10.140" style="s2">of what offers a health to a system but</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.589" end="01:01:16.529" style="s2">it does not ensure it is my only point</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.140" end="01:01:18.059" style="s2">there thank you I think maybe a good</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.529" end="01:01:20.609" style="s2">example would be like your unions</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.059" end="01:01:22.349" style="s2">because immune system can&#39;t afford to</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.609" end="01:01:25.589" style="s2">keep everything out because it will need</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.349" end="01:01:28.650" style="s2">to eat there&#39;s still a defense mechanism</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.589" end="01:01:30.749" style="s2">against things and fuel not have your</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.650" end="01:01:33.029" style="s2">best interests at heart let&#39;s say right</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.749" end="01:01:35.549" style="s2">and there&#39;s two categories of error</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.029" end="01:01:38.940" style="s2">there one where it&#39;s overly attacking</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.549" end="01:01:40.259" style="s2">things foreign things coming in and then</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.940" end="01:01:45.420" style="s2">the other where it starts attacking</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.259" end="01:01:48.630" style="s2">itself in in that effort right so you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.420" end="01:01:51.180" style="s2">got to be able to judge the near</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.630" end="01:01:54.720" style="s2">response so it&#39;s not to various but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.180" end="01:02:00.769" style="s2">also not inert you&#39;re just trying to</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.720" end="01:02:03.180" style="s2">maintain homeostasis we&#39;re down to is</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.769" end="01:02:05.420" style="s2">keeping the system balanced and not</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.180" end="01:02:13.009" style="s2">destroying others or destroying itself</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.420" end="01:02:13.009" style="s2">has no food right right</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.079" end="01:02:26.369" style="s2">yeah and there&#39;s of course many yeah</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.219" end="01:02:28.170" style="s2">perceptual problems that come yeah and a</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.369" end="01:02:31.949" style="s2">lot of my argument here is like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.170" end="01:02:36.900" style="s2">never gonna design the right system</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.949" end="01:02:38.819" style="s2">right it&#39;s like if we could in the sense</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.900" end="01:02:41.519" style="s2">of like Plato&#39;s Republic or something</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.819" end="01:02:44.219" style="s2">right we would all be living in the the</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.519" end="01:02:46.079" style="s2">wonderful perfect utopia and we would</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.219" end="01:02:48.749" style="s2">have been here from you know a hundred</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.079" end="01:02:51.329" style="s2">thousand years ago you know we&#39;ve had a</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.749" end="01:02:53.429" style="s2">lot of of our greatest minds try and</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.329" end="01:02:56.249" style="s2">tackle these problems none of them have</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.429" end="01:03:00.449" style="s2">ever been able to design a system that</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.249" end="01:03:03.329" style="s2">was free from these issues</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.449" end="01:03:04.589" style="s2">well can I jump in there again sorry I</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.329" end="01:03:07.679" style="s2">just wanted to say that&#39;s very much in</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.589" end="01:03:10.609" style="s2">line with us keys hope I think it was</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.679" end="01:03:13.819" style="s2">toski but his halting problems because</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.609" end="01:03:16.289" style="s2">he showed basically that there&#39;s no way</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.819" end="01:03:19.529" style="s2">to design an algorithm so that the</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.289" end="01:03:22.049" style="s2">algorithm itself will report if the</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.529" end="01:03:24.449" style="s2">algorithm has failed but you can&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.049" end="01:03:26.189" style="s2">can&#39;t trust the system to report to fade</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.449" end="01:03:28.559" style="s2">that you have to investigate it</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.189" end="01:03:31.829" style="s2">independently and write that that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.559" end="01:03:33.869" style="s2">like that that basic limitation applies</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.829" end="01:03:36.150" style="s2">to to any kind of system you want to</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.869" end="01:03:38.759" style="s2">build doesn&#39;t matter what it is and so</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.150" end="01:03:41.939" style="s2">no matter what you design it will always</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.759" end="01:03:47.849" style="s2">have that flaw within it thing was</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.939" end="01:03:49.439" style="s2">touring yeah sorry Turing is probably</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.849" end="01:03:51.019" style="s2">right that didn&#39;t sound right to me when</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.439" end="01:03:55.410" style="s2">I said to ask you sir</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.019" end="01:03:58.920" style="s2">Thanks yes yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.410" end="01:04:01.199" style="s2">example and I make an argument about</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.920" end="01:04:05.009" style="s2">this later when I get into that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.199" end="01:04:08.699" style="s2">health and unhealth and how an in a very</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.009" end="01:04:11.609" style="s2">very real way you know I borrow from</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.699" end="01:04:14.759" style="s2">verbe keys ecology of practices here</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.609" end="01:04:16.920" style="s2">where it&#39;s kind of like you know you</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.759" end="01:04:19.829" style="s2">can&#39;t design the perfect practice you</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.920" end="01:04:22.799" style="s2">can&#39;t even design the perfect like list</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.829" end="01:04:25.769" style="s2">of practices instead it&#39;s by following</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.799" end="01:04:26.980" style="s2">the practices in this ecological kind of</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.769" end="01:04:30.850" style="s2">balance</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.980" end="01:04:34.150" style="s2">and in this very dynamic sense that you</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.850" end="01:04:39.060" style="s2">can in some way get a grasp on the</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.150" end="01:04:41.920" style="s2">corrections in between your practices</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.060" end="01:04:45.010" style="s2">and even and obviously that&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.920" end="01:04:48.600" style="s2">insured path to success but I think it</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.010" end="01:04:52.530" style="s2">does give us a vision of just how very</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.600" end="01:04:56.410" style="s2">serious the problem of bullshitting is</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.530" end="01:04:58.930" style="s2">and then allows us to move forward being</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.410" end="01:05:01.830" style="s2">conscious of that propensity and trying</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.930" end="01:05:01.830" style="s2">to correct for it</p>

<p begin="01:05:18.230" end="01:05:25.160" style="s2">bit of time so I might actually just go</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.810" end="01:05:28.610" style="s2">ahead I think I&#39;ve communicated my man I</p>

<p begin="01:05:30.530" end="01:05:35.060" style="s2">clear enough does any way anyone have</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.690" end="01:05:45.200" style="s2">any questions on on the lens I&#39;m using</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.060" end="01:05:48.020" style="s2">and why I&#39;m using it just to clarify it</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.200" end="01:05:51.770" style="s2">seems like you&#39;re trying to look at the</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.020" end="01:05:53.750" style="s2">connotations in the history of cult the</p>

<p begin="01:05:56.120" end="01:06:03.920" style="s2">sociologically right right and then I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.560" end="01:06:07.780" style="s2">also trying to make the argument that in</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.920" end="01:06:12.860" style="s2">our current meaning crisis-ridden</p>

<p begin="01:06:16.850" end="01:06:21.740" style="s2">cult is breaking down in meaning and</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.670" end="01:06:24.530" style="s2">that the way we&#39;re using it is that now</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.740" end="01:06:29.540" style="s2">actively detrimental instead of useful</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.530" end="01:06:33.200" style="s2">and that&#39;s where part of the necessity</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.540" end="01:06:35.510" style="s2">aspect of my argument is coming from it</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.200" end="01:06:37.490" style="s2">should be noted that that both Lolich</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.510" end="01:06:39.200" style="s2">and another researcher that makes an</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.490" end="01:06:42.440" style="s2">arguments similar to hers</p>

<p begin="01:07:17.220" end="01:07:24.660" style="s2">to say that there are not coltie aspects</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.560" end="01:07:27.180" style="s2">in it well in all of politics there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.660" end="01:07:31.850" style="s2">something a little creepy about a cult</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.180" end="01:07:31.850" style="s2">expert using it as a political argument</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.859" end="01:07:41.900" style="s2">also I&#39;m I&#39;m not trying to make a</p>

<p begin="01:07:52.069" end="01:07:56.859" style="s2">call it Trump&#39;s whole thing and Colton</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.049" end="01:07:56.859" style="s2">be done with it</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.940" end="01:08:10.760" style="s2">I think that&#39;s because you&#39;re in a cult</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.410" end="01:08:16.160" style="s2">just know Trump is continued all right</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.760" end="01:08:18.410" style="s2">so finally let&#39;s get into some of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.160" end="01:08:23.839" style="s2">problems some of the good examples and</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.410" end="01:08:24.950" style="s2">some of the bad examples so I brought up</p>

<p begin="01:09:39.830" end="01:09:46.280" style="s2">truly and deeply powerful and meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.530" end="01:09:50.690" style="s2">and necessary for humans which I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.280" end="01:09:52.520" style="s2">terming ontological power and then I</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.690" end="01:09:55.670" style="s2">wanted to relate that difference between</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.520" end="01:09:58.610" style="s2">ontological and narcissistic power to</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.670" end="01:10:01.310" style="s2">the difference between surrender and</p>

<p begin="01:10:17.330" end="01:10:22.280" style="s2">that&#39;s online it&#39;s like 16 pages or</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.910" end="01:10:24.440" style="s2">something not that long of a read a lot</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.280" end="01:10:33.310" style="s2">of very valuable information should be</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.440" end="01:10:36.380" style="s2">taken with an enormous grain of salt so</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.310" end="01:10:39.020" style="s2">one of my main yeah I think the central</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.380" end="01:10:42.740" style="s2">thrust of this bit here is that</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.020" end="01:10:47.600" style="s2">particularly interfacing you know as we</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.740" end="01:10:50.420" style="s2">kind of attempt to find finns in our</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.600" end="01:10:52.540" style="s2">postmodern age and i&#39;m using the</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.420" end="01:11:01.130" style="s2">metaphor of being submerged in water</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.540" end="01:11:04.870" style="s2">very distinctly there we have gone we</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.130" end="01:11:08.750" style="s2">have in a sense fallen back on earlier</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.870" end="01:11:11.170" style="s2">systems for judging which i i&#39;ve played</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.750" end="01:11:14.810" style="s2">with this in terms of an authenticity</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.170" end="01:11:21.490" style="s2">hierarchy as opposed to modernism&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.810" end="01:11:25.370" style="s2">credibility hierarchy and that basically</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.490" end="01:11:30.170" style="s2">the major danger or the corruption point</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.370" end="01:11:34.910" style="s2">of a authenticity hierarchy is the</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.170" end="01:11:36.590" style="s2">ability to basically or rather our lack</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.910" end="01:11:40.630" style="s2">of ability to be able to mimic</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.590" end="01:11:43.400" style="s2">meaningfully differentiate between a</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.630" end="01:11:46.880" style="s2">sense of security and power that comes</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.400" end="01:11:50.410" style="s2">from having a deep ontological basis</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.880" end="01:11:56.090" style="s2">from portraying and extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.410" end="01:11:57.920" style="s2">narcissistic mode of interacting so</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.090" end="01:12:01.610" style="s2">basically authenticity hierarchies</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.920" end="01:12:03.740" style="s2">corrupt towards narcissism in many ways</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.610" end="01:12:10.040" style="s2">like a credibility hierarchy corrupts</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.740" end="01:12:13.130" style="s2">towards making it status as opposed to</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.040" end="01:12:15.170" style="s2">merit right when they start corrupting</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.130" end="01:12:19.820" style="s2">it&#39;s because the things like nepotism or</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.170" end="01:12:22.850" style="s2">or you know there&#39;s many mechanisms but</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.820" end="01:12:25.460" style="s2">basically the meritocratic element of a</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.850" end="01:12:28.760" style="s2">credibility hierarchy starts losing</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.460" end="01:12:31.580" style="s2">ground to something that is the display</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.760" end="01:12:39.170" style="s2">of merit without any of the actual meet</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.580" end="01:12:42.110" style="s2">of merit so III think this is perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.170" end="01:12:44.690" style="s2">also one element for the the people</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.110" end="01:12:46.970" style="s2">interested in the written our thing to</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.690" end="01:12:53.540" style="s2">figure out is it would be something like</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.970" end="01:12:55.610" style="s2">a mythos that gives people tools to</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.540" end="01:12:58.960" style="s2">repeat for being able to differentiate</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.610" end="01:13:00.860" style="s2">between people that have ontological</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.960" end="01:13:05.450" style="s2">security and people that are</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.860" end="01:13:08.240" style="s2">narcissistic and looking at how those</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.450" end="01:13:10.690" style="s2">things interact with each other I would</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.240" end="01:13:13.370" style="s2">argue that in our in our current system</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.690" end="01:13:17.930" style="s2">these are necessary features when you</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.370" end="01:13:22.220" style="s2">throw out a strong sense of an objective</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.930" end="01:13:23.960" style="s2">truth we we necessarily are going to</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.220" end="01:13:26.900" style="s2">start falling back on this and I would</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.960" end="01:13:30.050" style="s2">say it&#39;s already far too late to try and</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.900" end="01:13:34.100" style="s2">make arguments like no throw out all of</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.050" end="01:13:37.250" style="s2">social media instead go back to the</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.100" end="01:13:40.100" style="s2">institutionalized Sciences as a source</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.250" end="01:13:42.890" style="s2">of authority and people right now</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.100" end="01:13:44.780" style="s2">especially in a meaning crisis are going</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.890" end="01:13:47.570" style="s2">to be looking for people that have</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.780" end="01:13:50.210" style="s2">ontological security because it is</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.570" end="01:13:57.560" style="s2">synonymous with leading a meaningful</p>

<p begin="01:13:57.560" end="01:14:03.890" style="s2">from here is going to be able is going</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.980" end="01:14:06.470" style="s2">to need to be able to offer that to its</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.890" end="01:14:08.690" style="s2">practitioners whether that&#39;s one of the</p>

<p begin="01:14:08.690" end="01:14:14.090" style="s2">create a new way</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.870" end="01:14:16.820" style="s2">obviously there are really deep dangers</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.090" end="01:14:20.090" style="s2">there and there&#39;s gonna be a enormous</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.820" end="01:14:23.170" style="s2">potential for people to capitalize on</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.090" end="01:14:27.080" style="s2">people&#39;s innate sense of narcissism and</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.170" end="01:14:29.660" style="s2">abuse and misuse it and be selling them</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.080" end="01:14:30.830" style="s2">some sense of ontological security in</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.660" end="01:14:32.600" style="s2">the process</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.830" end="01:14:34.280" style="s2">while the person is actually not</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.600" end="01:14:42.710" style="s2">ontological II secure they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.280" end="01:14:44.060" style="s2">evermore narcissistic yeah okay also</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.710" end="01:14:49.760" style="s2">I&#39;ll be right back my throat is really</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.060" end="01:14:53.660" style="s2">dry and I drank all my water good guess</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.760" end="01:14:56.050" style="s2">I can plug tomorrow at one o&#39;clock</p>

<p begin="01:15:17.480" end="01:15:22.550" style="s2">might also add I think oh sorry I think</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.960" end="01:15:24.440" style="s2">this is one of the mechanisms by which</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.550" end="01:15:29.420" style="s2">the traditional religions actually</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.440" end="01:15:32.900" style="s2">corrupted was mistaking their belief for</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.420" end="01:15:37.040" style="s2">a type of narcissistic security right I</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.900" end="01:15:38.990" style="s2">am the special person in God&#39;s eyes that</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.040" end="01:15:41.960" style="s2">type of thing and none of it</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.990" end="01:15:45.770" style="s2">particularly giving a legitimate sense</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.960" end="01:15:48.410" style="s2">of of deep ontological security and I</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.770" end="01:15:51.500" style="s2">might also add that I think part of</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.410" end="01:15:57.380" style="s2">ontological security very deeply ties</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.500" end="01:16:00.320" style="s2">into for Vicky&#39;s definition and use of a</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.380" end="01:16:02.480" style="s2">word like a gothic love and this</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.320" end="01:16:05.840" style="s2">probably also hinted at although I think</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.480" end="01:16:08.540" style="s2">in my opinion not as meaningfully</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.840" end="01:16:11.600" style="s2">represented in Buddhist compassion and</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.540" end="01:16:16.370" style="s2">things like that and we all kind of know</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.600" end="01:16:18.860" style="s2">the story of or the meme if you will</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.370" end="01:16:22.220" style="s2">that the person that is most secure in</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.860" end="01:16:25.100" style="s2">themselves is often the least excitable</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.220" end="01:16:28.640" style="s2">in the sense of having their emotions</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.100" end="01:16:31.280" style="s2">manipulated by another and it&#39;s usually</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.640" end="01:16:33.620" style="s2">those that are trying to put on the air</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.280" end="01:16:35.810" style="s2">of ontological security in a</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.620" end="01:16:38.450" style="s2">particularly narcissistic fashion that</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.810" end="01:16:43.250" style="s2">feels the need to defend themselves from</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.450" end="01:16:45.470" style="s2">every meaningless slight against them so</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.250" end="01:16:47.630" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s differences I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.470" end="01:16:53.020" style="s2">highlight here in what those two are and</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.630" end="01:16:55.010" style="s2">why people seem so prone to mistake one</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.020" end="01:16:57.950" style="s2">sorry I&#39;ve got a little bit of pushback</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.010" end="01:17:00.050" style="s2">on this because I take your point with</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.950" end="01:17:02.200" style="s2">rigor with respect to the agape love but</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.050" end="01:17:02.200" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.380" end="01:17:10.130" style="s2">Isis but do you agree with the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.639" end="01:17:13.639" style="s2">perhaps John would think that instead of</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.130" end="01:17:19.420" style="s2">a copic love intelligibility is the the</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.639" end="01:17:19.420" style="s2">source of ontological security let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.900" end="01:17:26.960" style="s2">he might I would push back against him</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.940" end="01:17:28.219" style="s2">if he did yeah okay yeah I was just</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.960" end="01:17:30.290" style="s2">wondering if you could play with those</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.219" end="01:17:32.210" style="s2">two ideas the intelligibility plus is</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.290" end="01:17:34.340" style="s2">the copic love but I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.210" end="01:17:37.130" style="s2">I would I would say that the</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.340" end="01:17:39.530" style="s2">intelligibility is playing more deeply</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.130" end="01:17:42.380" style="s2">in the credibility hierarchy than it is</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.530" end="01:17:46.330" style="s2">in the authenticity hierarchy if I was</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.380" end="01:17:46.330" style="s2">to split it into my little system here</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.540" end="01:17:51.230" style="s2">right intelligibility would be how you</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.010" end="01:17:53.179" style="s2">climb in the credibility hierarchy and</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.230" end="01:17:56.199" style="s2">that&#39;s also deeply valuable it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.179" end="01:17:59.360" style="s2">operating on a different network I think</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.199" end="01:18:01.580" style="s2">okay so the the how at the ontological</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.360" end="01:18:03.250" style="s2">security tie-in with the credibility and</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.580" end="01:18:06.230" style="s2">the sorry what does the other one</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.250" end="01:18:08.630" style="s2">authenticity wait are you saying that</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.230" end="01:18:11.989" style="s2">those two aren&#39;t you don&#39;t have a way to</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.630" end="01:18:14.510" style="s2">bring those two together I would the the</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.989" end="01:18:17.889" style="s2">image I often use here is the Star of</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.510" end="01:18:20.510" style="s2">David so you have two hierarchies</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.889" end="01:18:23.389" style="s2">balanced against each other and are</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.510" end="01:18:27.260" style="s2">mostly overlapping with the very peaks</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.389" end="01:18:29.750" style="s2">of each hierarchy as well as the corners</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.260" end="01:18:33.440" style="s2">of the bases missing from each other</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.750" end="01:18:35.600" style="s2">so in some sense part of the very lowest</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.440" end="01:18:38.090" style="s2">of one hierarchy is missing from the</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.600" end="01:18:41.780" style="s2">other and the peak is also missing from</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.090" end="01:18:44.060" style="s2">the other but I think we need right if</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.780" end="01:18:47.389" style="s2">we&#39;re describing a stable meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.060" end="01:18:49.909" style="s2">system in some sense it is credibility</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.389" end="01:18:54.040" style="s2">that makes authenticity valuable and it</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.909" end="01:18:59.330" style="s2">is authenticity that makes credibility</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.040" end="01:19:01.130" style="s2">and synthesis right but I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.330" end="01:19:03.320" style="s2">connect that to the ontological security</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.130" end="01:19:06.290" style="s2">or like I&#39;m just not sure how those</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.320" end="01:19:07.960" style="s2">ideas relate right so I would argue that</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.290" end="01:19:13.190" style="s2">the the goal of the authenticity</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.960" end="01:19:16.250" style="s2">hierarchy is this ontological power yeah</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.190" end="01:19:19.970" style="s2">and and you say that that&#39;s a gothic</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.250" end="01:19:22.520" style="s2">I was trying to point towards a couple</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.970" end="01:19:26.060" style="s2">qualities that one might be able to</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.520" end="01:19:28.820" style="s2">discern about what ontological security</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.060" end="01:19:31.280" style="s2">offers a person that&#39;s not present in</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.820" end="01:19:33.320" style="s2">narcissism okay</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.280" end="01:19:34.790" style="s2">yeah okay I might be trying to be beeped</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.320" end="01:19:45.980" style="s2">in with you telling you then sorry</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.790" end="01:19:49.790" style="s2">no worries okay so yeah writing a bit</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.980" end="01:19:52.220" style="s2">more so dense article the submission</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.790" end="01:19:55.060" style="s2">verse surrender I think is also deeply</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.220" end="01:20:00.260" style="s2">important because it highlights how</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.060" end="01:20:04.160" style="s2">fundamental it is for people to be to</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.260" end="01:20:08.120" style="s2">have a deep need for surrender and this</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.160" end="01:20:10.820" style="s2">is right why do people interact in the</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.120" end="01:20:13.670" style="s2">way they do at all why do we find our</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.820" end="01:20:16.490" style="s2">lives becoming increasingly less</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.670" end="01:20:19.310" style="s2">meaningful despite the fact that we have</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.490" end="01:20:22.160" style="s2">more dominion over the world than ever</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.310" end="01:20:25.850" style="s2">before right we we are put ever less in</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.160" end="01:20:28.190" style="s2">a position of needing to surrender to</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.850" end="01:20:30.530" style="s2">that the things around us right we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.190" end="01:20:33.980" style="s2">becoming ever closer to the one man is</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.530" end="01:20:36.680" style="s2">you know I am an island type mythos</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.980" end="01:20:41.150" style="s2">right the peak of individuality or</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.680" end="01:20:43.310" style="s2">individuality as ideology and yet we</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.150" end="01:20:46.340" style="s2">find ourselves with higher suicide rates</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.310" end="01:20:48.700" style="s2">and and you know a crisis of meaning</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.340" end="01:20:53.510" style="s2">seemingly as a side effect from this</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.700" end="01:20:56.350" style="s2">dent rights and I would agree that there</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.510" end="01:21:01.100" style="s2">is well it&#39;s almost a type of hegelian</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.350" end="01:21:04.640" style="s2">argument that there is some really deep</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.100" end="01:21:10.280" style="s2">sense where surrender is where we find</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.640" end="01:21:12.380" style="s2">the whole of our being right and this</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.280" end="01:21:15.380" style="s2">this has to do with being witnessed it</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.380" end="01:21:19.220" style="s2">also has to do with being a witness unto</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.380" end="01:21:23.440" style="s2">ourselves you know it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.220" end="01:21:26.510" style="s2">within Hegel&#39;s master-slave dialectic</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.440" end="01:21:29.000" style="s2">the master is actually the one in a</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.510" end="01:21:31.100" style="s2">weaker ontological position the</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.000" end="01:21:35.020" style="s2">because he can never actually know</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.100" end="01:21:38.810" style="s2">himself fully because his his self</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.020" end="01:21:42.010" style="s2">definition is based off of the slave</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.810" end="01:21:47.200" style="s2">that he necessarily is excluded from</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.010" end="01:21:47.200" style="s2">whereas the slave can have a full</p>

<p begin="01:21:51.350" end="01:21:59.270" style="s2">no part is it is actually excluded it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.520" end="01:22:02.210" style="s2">not dependent upon the master for his</p>

<p begin="01:22:02.210" end="01:22:08.440" style="s2">disappears one day it&#39;s not like the</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.700" end="01:22:11.660" style="s2">slave suddenly has an identity crisis</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.440" end="01:22:18.920" style="s2">well they might but they at least have</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.660" end="01:22:20.690" style="s2">the potential not to so yes surrender is</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.920" end="01:22:24.250" style="s2">one of these mechanisms that&#39;s deeply</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.690" end="01:22:27.170" style="s2">meaningful especially in say the case of</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.250" end="01:22:29.990" style="s2">what verb a key is trying to do by</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.170" end="01:22:33.320" style="s2">bringing in transformational systems</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.990" end="01:22:36.650" style="s2">you cannot transform without an element</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.320" end="01:22:40.130" style="s2">of surrender right it&#39;s just not you</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.650" end="01:22:44.120" style="s2">must surrender something into something</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.130" end="01:22:46.700" style="s2">in order for transformation to occur so</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.120" end="01:22:50.920" style="s2">the the deep danger that ghent brings up</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.700" end="01:22:54.620" style="s2">is in this mistaking of surrender and</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.920" end="01:22:57.410" style="s2">submitting and he kind of pulls the two</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.620" end="01:22:59.330" style="s2">apart some of it is a little funky but I</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.410" end="01:23:01.760" style="s2">think it&#39;s a valuable you know</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.330" end="01:23:06.830" style="s2">distinction he&#39;s making even if I</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.760" end="01:23:09.730" style="s2">disagree with certain aspects one of the</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.830" end="01:23:12.440" style="s2">bits is like the use of will right</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.730" end="01:23:16.820" style="s2">submit ins is what we do when we</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.440" end="01:23:20.720" style="s2">willfully try and surrender right in</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.820" end="01:23:23.330" style="s2">some deep sense you can consider</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.720" end="01:23:25.700" style="s2">surrender to be similar to the process</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.330" end="01:23:28.610" style="s2">of falling asleep it&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.700" end="01:23:31.640" style="s2">you can give yourself an affordance for</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.610" end="01:23:34.310" style="s2">but you cannot actually will yourself to</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.640" end="01:23:36.770" style="s2">sleep likewise you cannot will yourself</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.310" end="01:23:39.429" style="s2">into surrender you can only will</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.770" end="01:23:42.400" style="s2">yourself into submission</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.429" end="01:23:45.239" style="s2">and this is part and this I found very</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.400" end="01:23:48.400" style="s2">meaningful coming out of my cult or</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.239" end="01:23:52.059" style="s2">going into my cult for experience as I</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.400" end="01:23:56.519" style="s2">had just come out of this deep state of</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.059" end="01:23:58.619" style="s2">surrender that was extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.519" end="01:24:02.320" style="s2">exponentially and ontologically</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.619" end="01:24:03.489" style="s2">meaningful and finding myself lacking</p>

<p begin="01:24:03.489" end="01:24:09.249" style="s2">I immediately willfully sought it in</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.340" end="01:24:13.420" style="s2">some sense through submission granted I</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.249" end="01:24:16.030" style="s2">did not fully ever submit to the system</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.420" end="01:24:19.119" style="s2">but I can see that the the movement</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.030" end="01:24:21.459" style="s2">inside my own head for how that</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.119" end="01:24:24.249" style="s2">transition occurred and how likely that</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.459" end="01:24:27.189" style="s2">transition is to happen so again when</p>

<p begin="01:24:30.389" end="01:24:35.469" style="s2">something that makes a very deep</p>

<p begin="01:27:30.820" end="01:27:36.730" style="s2">that surrender imposed on me no not</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.750" end="01:27:39.270" style="s2">directly I could have fought against it</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.730" end="01:27:43.929" style="s2">I probably just would have ended up</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.270" end="01:27:47.349" style="s2">psychotic in the process arguably I</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.929" end="01:27:50.920" style="s2">would say to you will necessarily end up</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.349" end="01:27:54.880" style="s2">psychotic if you have lost the ability</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.920" end="01:27:56.559" style="s2">to surrender much like you would end up</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.880" end="01:27:57.990" style="s2">psychotic if you lost the ability to</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.559" end="01:28:00.990" style="s2">sleep</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.990" end="01:28:00.990" style="s2">shit</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.930" end="01:28:13.840" style="s2">so you think you can impose submission</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.970" end="01:28:16.930" style="s2">yes absolutely of course</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.840" end="01:28:21.490" style="s2">right someone can can overpower you use</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.930" end="01:28:25.830" style="s2">a gun break your leg whatever right</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.490" end="01:28:25.830" style="s2">the act of submission is still a choice</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.940" end="01:28:36.050" style="s2">yeah in some to some degree you know I</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.960" end="01:28:39.050" style="s2">mean at a certain point viewing it as a</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.050" end="01:28:45.170" style="s2">choice seems more ideologically driven</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.050" end="01:28:47.720" style="s2">than meaningfully driven but yes there</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.170" end="01:28:53.540" style="s2">is some point where a person could stop</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.720" end="01:28:56.330" style="s2">struggling against the situation whether</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.540" end="01:29:02.510" style="s2">one calls that surrender or submission</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.330" end="01:29:04.610" style="s2">it&#39;s perhaps well highly dependent on</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.510" end="01:29:07.430" style="s2">the scenario also I don&#39;t want to stick</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.610" end="01:29:09.640" style="s2">to strong lead against distinction here</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.430" end="01:29:12.500" style="s2">again I think there&#39;s very many useful</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.640" end="01:29:15.590" style="s2">aspects of what he&#39;s teasing apart but I</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.500" end="01:29:17.690" style="s2">don&#39;t want to like view this surrender</p>

<p begin="01:29:17.690" end="01:29:25.100" style="s2">like I back it a hundred percent there</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.430" end="01:29:28.240" style="s2">are some cases where I think willful</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.100" end="01:29:33.100" style="s2">submission can be generative and useful</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.240" end="01:29:33.100" style="s2">which he seems very blatantly against</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.190" end="01:29:43.030" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.760" end="01:29:46.390" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.410" end="01:29:53.170" style="s2">yeah so defining oh sorry</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.070" end="01:29:58.929" style="s2">cases where surrender and submission</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.280" end="01:30:02.940" style="s2">could be generative but generated for</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.929" end="01:30:02.940" style="s2">who for the surrender</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.619" end="01:30:12.869" style="s2">well there&#39;s certainly cases where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.290" end="01:30:12.869" style="s2">generative for growth or either party</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.349" end="01:30:35.369" style="s2">yeah or or even you know biasing towards</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.710" end="01:30:40.260" style="s2">the person submitting is probably fine</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.369" end="01:30:40.260" style="s2">we would like it to be more valuable</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.119" end="01:30:59.139" style="s2">sorry you know we&#39;re getting a quite a</p>

<p begin="01:31:05.050" end="01:31:10.500" style="s2">you should probably run for some</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.090" end="01:31:27.429" style="s2">yeah so being aware that that some type</p>

<p begin="01:31:27.429" end="01:31:32.949" style="s2">transformation is important</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.739" end="01:31:34.539" style="s2">don&#39;t be naive and think I can you know</p>

<p begin="01:34:28.770" end="01:34:33.750" style="s2">behind and you do your own thing ideally</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.010" end="01:34:37.020" style="s2">in such a way that it makes the system</p>

<p begin="01:35:29.909" end="01:35:33.929" style="s2">so much easier to create knowledge</p>

<p begin="01:37:18.150" end="01:37:25.080" style="s2">I found is right the classic easy in</p>
<p begin="01:37:21.480" end="01:37:28.949" style="s2">hard out is really creepy do not do that</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.080" end="01:37:33.410" style="s2">one it&#39;s powerful its effective and it</p>
<p begin="01:37:28.949" end="01:37:37.500" style="s2">it almost certainly creates a situation</p>
<p begin="01:37:33.410" end="01:37:40.739" style="s2">that is exceptionally open to abuse so</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.500" end="01:37:44.070" style="s2">easy and hard out want to avoid that as</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.739" end="01:37:46.080" style="s2">much as possible easy in easy out is</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.070" end="01:37:48.360" style="s2">what I would say most cultic</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.080" end="01:37:50.820" style="s2">affiliations are at right now this is</p>
<p begin="01:37:48.360" end="01:37:53.370" style="s2">similar to like okay well I get to</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.820" end="01:37:56.430" style="s2">belong to the cultic affiliation of</p>
<p begin="01:37:53.370" end="01:37:59.250" style="s2">Volcom by spending $50 on the t-shirt</p>
<p begin="01:37:56.430" end="01:38:01.410" style="s2">instead of $10 on the target t-shirt or</p>
<p begin="01:37:59.250" end="01:38:05.910" style="s2">whatever right so it cost me 40 bucks</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.410" end="01:38:07.770" style="s2">for this association and then I can just</p>
<p begin="01:38:05.910" end="01:38:10.680" style="s2">take the shirt off or throw it away and</p>
<p begin="01:38:07.770" end="01:38:13.530" style="s2">I no longer hold the Association right</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.680" end="01:38:17.690" style="s2">easy and easy out there&#39;s not much going</p>
<p begin="01:38:13.530" end="01:38:20.400" style="s2">on there the problem comes with dealing</p>
<p begin="01:38:17.690" end="01:38:23.670" style="s2">especially you know outside of these</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.400" end="01:38:25.470" style="s2">these kind of just stealing when you get</p>
<p begin="01:38:23.670" end="01:38:27.300" style="s2">out of just signaling and into</p>
<p begin="01:38:25.470" end="01:38:30.860" style="s2">transformative work you&#39;re gonna face a</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.300" end="01:38:33.480" style="s2">lot of problems with cultural entropy</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.860" end="01:38:37.320" style="s2">stripping the meaning and eroding the</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.480" end="01:38:39.989" style="s2">meaning from your system and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.320" end="01:38:42.390" style="s2">gonna become really prevalent in an easy</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.989" end="01:38:46.050" style="s2">and easy out system this is how you get</p>
<p begin="01:38:42.390" end="01:38:49.560" style="s2">things like McDonald&#39;s yoga right like</p>
<p begin="01:38:46.050" end="01:38:53.070" style="s2">where we we we take hatha yoga one of</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.560" end="01:38:55.980" style="s2">eight branches of yoga we strip it of</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.070" end="01:38:59.630" style="s2">every meaningful context that made it</p>
<p begin="01:38:55.980" end="01:39:04.890" style="s2">something sacred and then we sell it to</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.630" end="01:39:06.239" style="s2">Westerners as basically you know pseudo</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.890" end="01:39:08.730" style="s2">spirit yes</p>
<p begin="01:39:06.239" end="01:39:11.070" style="s2">pseudo spiritual Pilates and that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:39:08.730" end="01:39:13.020" style="s2">there is to it right and yes is it is it</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.070" end="01:39:16.530" style="s2">doing something yeah probably</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.020" end="01:39:19.970" style="s2">and you know the problem is that if all</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.530" end="01:39:22.800" style="s2">of our spiritual or wisdom tradition</p>
<p begin="01:39:19.970" end="01:39:24.540" style="s2">tradition systems are functioning on</p>
<p begin="01:39:22.800" end="01:39:26.880" style="s2">that principle they will be consumed</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.540" end="01:39:29.610" style="s2">alive by the culture and they will never</p>
<p begin="01:39:26.880" end="01:39:32.940" style="s2">actually deal with the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.610" end="01:39:35.520" style="s2">problem in any meaningful sense which</p>
<p begin="01:39:32.940" end="01:39:38.940" style="s2">leads me to the last which is hard in</p>
<p begin="01:39:35.520" end="01:39:41.370" style="s2">easy out you want to form some type of</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.940" end="01:39:43.830" style="s2">boundary that makes it relatively hard</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.370" end="01:39:46.560" style="s2">for a person to enter into your system</p>
<p begin="01:39:43.830" end="01:39:48.840" style="s2">that way they cannot just</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.560" end="01:39:51.530" style="s2">steal and run with whatever they want</p>
<p begin="01:39:48.840" end="01:39:53.780" style="s2">and go make shitty versions of it</p>
<p begin="01:39:51.530" end="01:39:56.580" style="s2">likewise you want to make it as</p>
<p begin="01:39:53.780" end="01:39:58.410" style="s2">extremely easy as possible low</p>
<p begin="01:39:56.580" end="01:40:00.480" style="s2">commitment to leave and that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:39:58.410" end="01:40:04.110" style="s2">really difficult to do for a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.480" end="01:40:06.120" style="s2">other sociological reasons right how</p>
<p begin="01:40:04.110" end="01:40:11.400" style="s2">humans form relationships and that type</p>
<p begin="01:40:06.120" end="01:40:13.740" style="s2">of stuff but in in my experience this is</p>
<p begin="01:40:11.400" end="01:40:17.250" style="s2">how you most this is the best way to</p>
<p begin="01:40:13.740" end="01:40:19.890" style="s2">deal with this the the two dangers</p>
<p begin="01:40:17.250" end="01:40:21.990" style="s2">appear one becoming creepy and insular</p>
<p begin="01:40:19.890" end="01:40:24.870" style="s2">and manipulative and the other being</p>
<p begin="01:40:21.990" end="01:40:28.560" style="s2">totally meaningless and ineffective so</p>
<p begin="01:40:24.870" end="01:40:30.660" style="s2">and some good you know one good model of</p>
<p begin="01:40:28.560" end="01:40:33.480" style="s2">this is something like the Orthodox</p>
<p begin="01:40:30.660" end="01:40:35.520" style="s2">Christian Church where it&#39;s very easy to</p>
<p begin="01:40:33.480" end="01:40:38.550" style="s2">come in you&#39;re totally allowed to show</p>
<p begin="01:40:35.520" end="01:40:43.940" style="s2">up at a at a whatever a service or a</p>
<p begin="01:40:38.550" end="01:40:47.040" style="s2">sermon but to actually be considered a</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.940" end="01:40:50.520" style="s2">you know a member of the church is a</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.040" end="01:40:53.160" style="s2">very long process of regularly showing</p>
<p begin="01:40:50.520" end="01:40:55.380" style="s2">up at that church not having the right</p>
<p begin="01:40:53.160" end="01:40:58.040" style="s2">to claim that your forget that</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.380" end="01:41:01.050" style="s2">catechumen or whatever that first stages</p>
<p begin="01:40:58.040" end="01:41:04.530" style="s2">and and generally showing a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:41:01.050" end="01:41:07.080" style="s2">interest and and devotion to wanting to</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.530" end="01:41:09.270" style="s2">be part of this structure and it&#39;s after</p>
<p begin="01:41:07.080" end="01:41:11.490" style="s2">having gone through this and learning</p>
<p begin="01:41:09.270" end="01:41:14.400" style="s2">and all this stuff that they finally let</p>
<p begin="01:41:11.490" end="01:41:16.320" style="s2">you in so it&#39;s not hard in in the sense</p>
<p begin="01:41:14.400" end="01:41:18.540" style="s2">of like you can&#39;t even get in the door</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.320" end="01:41:21.300" style="s2">you want to be able to get in the door</p>
<p begin="01:41:18.540" end="01:41:23.790" style="s2">but to be a meaningful contributing</p>
<p begin="01:41:21.300" end="01:41:26.630" style="s2">member and to be considered part of the</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.790" end="01:41:29.670" style="s2">in-group of the church is quite a to-do</p>
<p begin="01:41:26.630" end="01:41:33.810" style="s2">and then of course you can just leave if</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.670" end="01:41:36.750" style="s2">you so wish so that&#39;s one way to deal</p>
<p begin="01:41:33.810" end="01:41:38.370" style="s2">with it many ways to set up this case</p>
<p begin="01:41:36.750" end="01:41:40.980" style="s2">but I was just trying to create a broad</p>
<p begin="01:41:38.370" end="01:41:42.750" style="s2">broad stroke picture there of different</p>
<p begin="01:41:40.980" end="01:41:45.020" style="s2">setups and what the kind of trade-offs</p>
<p begin="01:41:42.750" end="01:41:45.020" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="01:41:46.469" end="01:41:52.030" style="s2">Transparency don&#39;t do things you&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="01:41:48.670" end="01:41:56.380" style="s2">ashamed of this should be obvious and</p>
<p begin="01:41:52.030" end="01:41:58.599" style="s2">yet it&#39;s usually not in practice you</p>
<p begin="01:41:56.380" end="01:42:00.880" style="s2">know this is like the safe space problem</p>
<p begin="01:41:58.599" end="01:42:04.300" style="s2">you know you create a little bubble</p>
<p begin="01:42:00.880" end="01:42:06.159" style="s2">where you can relax and you know let</p>
<p begin="01:42:04.300" end="01:42:07.989" style="s2">down the shields a little and then and</p>
<p begin="01:42:06.159" end="01:42:10.840" style="s2">then you find yourself on a slippery</p>
<p begin="01:42:07.989" end="01:42:13.719" style="s2">slope towards doing things that you</p>
<p begin="01:42:10.840" end="01:42:17.290" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t do if you were in more open</p>
<p begin="01:42:13.719" end="01:42:20.260" style="s2">view so there are limits to this right</p>
<p begin="01:42:17.290" end="01:42:22.119" style="s2">there is a need for private spaces and</p>
<p begin="01:42:20.260" end="01:42:25.900" style="s2">private life</p>
<p begin="01:42:22.119" end="01:42:29.290" style="s2">however ideally one keeps in mind the</p>
<p begin="01:42:25.900" end="01:42:31.960" style="s2">idea of of transparency and not doing</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.290" end="01:42:39.099" style="s2">things that we ourselves would be</p>
<p begin="01:42:31.960" end="01:42:42.040" style="s2">ashamed of all right we&#39;re running out</p>
<p begin="01:42:39.099" end="01:42:44.320" style="s2">of time so I&#39;m gonna hit on on the last</p>
<p begin="01:42:42.040" end="01:42:46.119" style="s2">one or I&#39;ve got a bunch more here but</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.320" end="01:42:48.219" style="s2">there&#39;s one that I think is really</p>
<p begin="01:42:46.119" end="01:42:52.540" style="s2">important and very immediately</p>
<p begin="01:42:48.219" end="01:42:57.340" style="s2">actionable and that&#39;s to create a system</p>
<p begin="01:42:52.540" end="01:43:00.730" style="s2">of yellow flags and red flags before you</p>
<p begin="01:42:57.340" end="01:43:04.270" style="s2">go into a transformative community or</p>
<p begin="01:43:00.730" end="01:43:07.060" style="s2">deal with these types of systems where</p>
<p begin="01:43:04.270" end="01:43:11.079" style="s2">you&#39;re challenging your worldview at a</p>
<p begin="01:43:07.060" end="01:43:14.079" style="s2">very deep level so this is make a list</p>
<p begin="01:43:11.079" end="01:43:16.929" style="s2">of yellows this is things that should</p>
<p begin="01:43:14.079" end="01:43:19.210" style="s2">give you pause but are not a reason unto</p>
<p begin="01:43:16.929" end="01:43:25.000" style="s2">themselves to go fuck this I&#39;m done with</p>
<p begin="01:43:19.210" end="01:43:27.040" style="s2">it right yellow flags this should when</p>
<p begin="01:43:25.000" end="01:43:29.320" style="s2">you cross one of these it should be</p>
<p begin="01:43:27.040" end="01:43:31.810" style="s2">raising your suspicion level it should</p>
<p begin="01:43:29.320" end="01:43:34.510" style="s2">be making you really start taking a look</p>
<p begin="01:43:31.810" end="01:43:38.469" style="s2">at what&#39;s happening and also ideally</p>
<p begin="01:43:34.510" end="01:43:40.570" style="s2">kicking in fixes that would be useful to</p>
<p begin="01:43:38.469" end="01:43:44.920" style="s2">the group within a healthy group at</p>
<p begin="01:43:40.570" end="01:43:48.360" style="s2">least red flags are the no Nevers right</p>
<p begin="01:43:44.920" end="01:43:51.460" style="s2">this is like if you run into one of your</p>
<p begin="01:43:48.360" end="01:43:53.980" style="s2">predefined red flags you&#39;ve made a</p>
<p begin="01:43:51.460" end="01:43:56.800" style="s2">commitment to yourself to no longer have</p>
<p begin="01:43:53.980" end="01:43:58.340" style="s2">anything to do with the group of people</p>
<p begin="01:43:56.800" end="01:44:02.900" style="s2">that you&#39;re interacting</p>
<p begin="01:43:58.340" end="01:44:05.120" style="s2">right and so yellows offer you a little</p>
<p begin="01:44:02.900" end="01:44:07.640" style="s2">bit of flexibility and the potential for</p>
<p begin="01:44:05.120" end="01:44:10.790" style="s2">growth while allowing you to engage a</p>
<p begin="01:44:07.640" end="01:44:14.630" style="s2">defensive system meaningfully red flags</p>
<p begin="01:44:10.790" end="01:44:18.070" style="s2">are the is how you keep yourself from</p>
<p begin="01:44:14.630" end="01:44:22.820" style="s2">sliding down an endlessly slippery slope</p>
<p begin="01:44:18.070" end="01:44:26.060" style="s2">and when it&#39;s hard to say this it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:44:22.820" end="01:44:28.790" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to give people a sense of this</p>
<p begin="01:44:26.060" end="01:44:32.840" style="s2">kind of death by a thousand paper cuts</p>
<p begin="01:44:28.790" end="01:44:35.420" style="s2">that happens within the these groups but</p>
<p begin="01:44:32.840" end="01:44:38.330" style="s2">you know I I credit a good portion of my</p>
<p begin="01:44:35.420" end="01:44:42.910" style="s2">leaving cult for with having set up</p>
<p begin="01:44:38.330" end="01:44:46.760" style="s2">before interacting with it a list of</p>
<p begin="01:44:42.910" end="01:44:49.850" style="s2">signs for myself where I would you know</p>
<p begin="01:44:46.760" end="01:44:53.210" style="s2">I drew one line in the sand and then I</p>
<p begin="01:44:49.850" end="01:44:54.950" style="s2">drew one in like granite and when I got</p>
<p begin="01:44:53.210" end="01:44:57.920" style="s2">up to that line that was carved in</p>
<p begin="01:44:54.950" end="01:45:00.080" style="s2">Granite that was how I it&#39;s what gave me</p>
<p begin="01:44:57.920" end="01:45:02.840" style="s2">the umph to actually be able to kick</p>
<p begin="01:45:00.080" end="01:45:05.750" style="s2">myself out of this you know death by a</p>
<p begin="01:45:02.840" end="01:45:10.130" style="s2">thousand paper cut slide that I was on</p>
<p begin="01:45:05.750" end="01:45:11.750" style="s2">so I really highly recommend doing</p>
<p begin="01:45:10.130" end="01:45:14.780" style="s2">something like that when you start</p>
<p begin="01:45:11.750" end="01:45:16.780" style="s2">interfacing with you know experimental</p>
<p begin="01:45:14.780" end="01:45:19.310" style="s2">groups or or or even not even</p>
<p begin="01:45:16.780" end="01:45:22.520" style="s2">experimental groups right they can be</p>
<p begin="01:45:19.310" end="01:45:25.220" style="s2">entirely mainstream groups and and you</p>
<p begin="01:45:22.520" end="01:45:28.190" style="s2">know the political discourse slides to</p>
<p begin="01:45:25.220" end="01:45:32.060" style="s2">such a level that our internal compass</p>
<p begin="01:45:28.190" end="01:45:33.950" style="s2">gets totally you know shifted into a</p>
<p begin="01:45:32.060" end="01:45:36.680" style="s2">place where we start becoming something</p>
<p begin="01:45:33.950" end="01:45:39.140" style="s2">we never thought we could be of course</p>
<p begin="01:45:36.680" end="01:45:45.740" style="s2">the much overused reference to Nazi</p>
<p begin="01:45:39.140" end="01:45:47.780" style="s2">Germany comes to mind yeah oh okay any</p>
<p begin="01:45:45.740" end="01:45:49.460" style="s2">questions sorry I thought I could get</p>
<p begin="01:45:47.780" end="01:45:52.100" style="s2">through more of it I got a good number a</p>
<p begin="01:45:49.460" end="01:45:53.780" style="s2">good chunk of the good stuff out there</p>
<p begin="01:45:52.100" end="01:46:00.020" style="s2">hopefully you guys found some of that</p>
<p begin="01:45:53.780" end="01:46:02.660" style="s2">useful and I&#39;m open for Q&amp;A if well just</p>
<p begin="01:46:00.020" end="01:46:06.070" style="s2">really quickly the granite line for</p>
<p begin="01:46:02.660" end="01:46:06.070" style="s2">caught them before what was it exactly</p>
<p begin="01:46:07.719" end="01:46:11.869" style="s2">like what was the thing that kicked you</p>
<p begin="01:46:09.920" end="01:46:13.519" style="s2">out of comfortable sorry I was trying to</p>
<p begin="01:46:11.869" end="01:46:21.380" style="s2">kick yourself out there heating the</p>
<p begin="01:46:13.519" end="01:46:25.489" style="s2">water it was in this case it wasn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="01:46:21.380" end="01:46:30.999" style="s2">a the granite line to be honest so much</p>
<p begin="01:46:25.489" end="01:46:34.579" style="s2">is like I had not as I had already</p>
<p begin="01:46:30.999" end="01:46:37.670" style="s2">experimented with crossing it and it was</p>
<p begin="01:46:34.579" end="01:46:39.679" style="s2">in some deep sense watching myself cross</p>
<p begin="01:46:37.670" end="01:46:43.070" style="s2">it that gave me a panic attack that</p>
<p begin="01:46:39.679" end="01:46:46.519" style="s2">kicked me out of the group in this case</p>
<p begin="01:46:43.070" end="01:46:49.820" style="s2">it was a specific form I was given a</p>
<p begin="01:46:46.519" end="01:46:53.809" style="s2">slight position of power over one of the</p>
<p begin="01:46:49.820" end="01:46:57.769" style="s2">other cult members and it was acting as</p>
<p begin="01:46:53.809" end="01:47:02.239" style="s2">a relay between the cult leader and the</p>
<p begin="01:46:57.769" end="01:47:05.300" style="s2">person and the mechanisms for growth had</p>
<p begin="01:47:02.239" end="01:47:07.869" style="s2">basically started sliding out of a kind</p>
<p begin="01:47:05.300" end="01:47:10.309" style="s2">of transformative framework into a</p>
<p begin="01:47:07.869" end="01:47:12.320" style="s2">listen to what the cult leader tells you</p>
<p begin="01:47:10.309" end="01:47:14.449" style="s2">because it will be faster and more</p>
<p begin="01:47:12.320" end="01:47:19.699" style="s2">effective than you figuring it out on</p>
<p begin="01:47:14.449" end="01:47:23.090" style="s2">your own and upon relaying a message to</p>
<p begin="01:47:19.699" end="01:47:25.670" style="s2">that effect is was my moment where I</p>
<p begin="01:47:23.090" end="01:47:28.690" style="s2">crossed the red line and went okay this</p>
<p begin="01:47:25.670" end="01:47:32.300" style="s2">is fucked and got the fuck out of there</p>
<p begin="01:47:28.690" end="01:47:35.420" style="s2">so I know the warning signs of the</p>
<p begin="01:47:32.300" end="01:47:37.190" style="s2">danger of you know where we can go wrong</p>
<p begin="01:47:35.420" end="01:47:39.800" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s the part I&#39;m the most</p>
<p begin="01:47:37.190" end="01:47:42.380" style="s2">interested in do you have enough in what</p>
<p begin="01:47:39.800" end="01:47:43.699" style="s2">you didn&#39;t get to for maybe a shorter</p>
<p begin="01:47:42.380" end="01:47:46.280" style="s2">session where we could really deep dive</p>
<p begin="01:47:43.699" end="01:47:48.999" style="s2">into those for like an hour maybe next</p>
<p begin="01:47:46.280" end="01:47:51.469" style="s2">week yeah I definitely be down for that</p>
<p begin="01:47:48.999" end="01:47:53.929" style="s2">it would probably be a fun one to</p>
<p begin="01:47:51.469" end="01:47:55.610" style="s2">actually talk about in a more group like</p>
<p begin="01:47:53.929" end="01:47:57.860" style="s2">setting as well where I could list out</p>
<p begin="01:47:55.610" end="01:48:00.230" style="s2">some points and some top talking topics</p>
<p begin="01:47:57.860" end="01:48:03.650" style="s2">and then get more people involved in the</p>
<p begin="01:48:00.230" end="01:48:05.230" style="s2">discussion yes the overt lecture format</p>
<p begin="01:48:03.650" end="01:48:07.820" style="s2">here so why don&#39;t we squeeze in one yeah</p>
<p begin="01:48:05.230" end="01:48:09.679" style="s2">yeah or so yeah one more question from</p>
<p begin="01:48:07.820" end="01:48:11.030" style="s2">Ehlo in the Czech I&#39;m gonna read it just</p>
<p begin="01:48:09.679" end="01:48:13.429" style="s2">because you know I think you&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="01:48:11.030" end="01:48:15.650" style="s2">some wind problems do you have specific</p>
<p begin="01:48:13.429" end="01:48:18.079" style="s2">comments on behalf I&#39;m sorry do you have</p>
<p begin="01:48:15.650" end="01:48:20.210" style="s2">specific comments on being skeptical but</p>
<p begin="01:48:18.079" end="01:48:22.340" style="s2">not doubtful and dismissive on the</p>
<p begin="01:48:20.210" end="01:48:27.800" style="s2">flipside optimistic but not deluding</p>
<p begin="01:48:22.340" end="01:48:29.690" style="s2">yourself yeah I mean you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:48:27.800" end="01:48:32.300" style="s2">you&#39;re centering in on the problem there</p>
<p begin="01:48:29.690" end="01:48:38.030" style="s2">which is just like again</p>
<p begin="01:48:32.300" end="01:48:43.310" style="s2">the aspects that we need are the same</p>
<p begin="01:48:38.030" end="01:48:48.590" style="s2">ones that make us so susceptible do I</p>
<p begin="01:48:43.310" end="01:48:50.150" style="s2">have my you know how to be skeptical</p>
<p begin="01:48:48.590" end="01:48:52.910" style="s2">without being doubtful</p>
<p begin="01:48:50.150" end="01:48:54.380" style="s2">I mean Brett you could run that way</p>
<p begin="01:48:52.910" end="01:48:57.050" style="s2">maybe we could have a little</p>
<p begin="01:48:54.380" end="01:48:59.030" style="s2">conversation on that yeah right I mean</p>
<p begin="01:48:57.050" end="01:49:01.760" style="s2">it but it is it&#39;s it&#39;s interesting right</p>
<p begin="01:48:59.030" end="01:49:07.219" style="s2">the science of doubt I&#39;m sorry</p>
<p begin="01:49:01.760" end="01:49:09.440" style="s2">pleasure of telling science of that you</p>
<p begin="01:49:07.219" end="01:49:12.290" style="s2">know you&#39;ve come from a very skeptic</p>
<p begin="01:49:09.440" end="01:49:14.750" style="s2">point and now you&#39;re regularly partaking</p>
<p begin="01:49:12.290" end="01:49:17.390" style="s2">in rituals and meditation and and all</p>
<p begin="01:49:14.750" end="01:49:19.250" style="s2">these things and it seems like you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:49:17.390" end="01:49:21.080" style="s2">afforded yourself a tremendous amount of</p>
<p begin="01:49:19.250" end="01:49:25.940" style="s2">pragmatism to be able to make these</p>
<p begin="01:49:21.080" end="01:49:27.860" style="s2">moves and explore them by in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:49:25.940" end="01:49:30.230" style="s2">judging against your meaning is that</p>
<p begin="01:49:27.860" end="01:49:32.810" style="s2">your sense of meaning and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:49:30.230" end="01:49:35.900" style="s2">there&#39;s a difference between skepticism</p>
<p begin="01:49:32.810" end="01:49:38.660" style="s2">and being doubtful and being cynical</p>
<p begin="01:49:35.900" end="01:49:41.060" style="s2">so there&#39;s cynicism which is just more</p>
<p begin="01:49:38.660" end="01:49:43.190" style="s2">like the dismissiveness of just you know</p>
<p begin="01:49:41.060" end="01:49:45.469" style="s2">that that could never be it you know</p>
<p begin="01:49:43.190" end="01:49:47.680" style="s2">pshaw and then there&#39;s active open</p>
<p begin="01:49:45.469" end="01:49:52.370" style="s2">mindedness</p>
<p begin="01:49:47.680" end="01:49:55.040" style="s2">you know not you know being hesitant and</p>
<p begin="01:49:52.370" end="01:49:57.350" style="s2">being not willing to just grab on to</p>
<p begin="01:49:55.040" end="01:49:59.420" style="s2">whatever gets proposed and wanting you</p>
<p begin="01:49:57.350" end="01:50:02.810" style="s2">know a certain standard of evidence but</p>
<p begin="01:49:59.420" end="01:50:05.660" style="s2">being open to receiving that and then</p>
<p begin="01:50:02.810" end="01:50:08.630" style="s2">there&#39;s some pragmatism you know if if</p>
<p begin="01:50:05.660" end="01:50:13.489" style="s2">it&#39;s you know they&#39;re the more dangerous</p>
<p begin="01:50:08.630" end="01:50:14.690" style="s2">something is the more the less the the</p>
<p begin="01:50:13.489" end="01:50:17.300" style="s2">less I&#39;m willing to just be pragmatic</p>
<p begin="01:50:14.690" end="01:50:19.610" style="s2">and and the more I&#39;m going to want it to</p>
<p begin="01:50:17.300" end="01:50:23.180" style="s2">be solid before before jumping in when</p>
<p begin="01:50:19.610" end="01:50:25.730" style="s2">it&#39;s other things were you know the some</p>
<p begin="01:50:23.180" end="01:50:27.800" style="s2">experimentation is it was probably not a</p>
<p begin="01:50:25.730" end="01:50:29.360" style="s2">bad we could spend I mean yeah maybe we</p>
<p begin="01:50:27.800" end="01:50:30.680" style="s2">should we should have a whole discussion</p>
<p begin="01:50:29.360" end="01:50:33.140" style="s2">just on</p>
<p begin="01:50:30.680" end="01:50:37.670" style="s2">that balance between skepticism and</p>
<p begin="01:50:33.140" end="01:50:40.460" style="s2">cynicism and having some amount of tools</p>
<p begin="01:50:37.670" end="01:50:42.560" style="s2">for how to stay in it you know how to</p>
<p begin="01:50:40.460" end="01:50:45.380" style="s2">navigate that it would probably be very</p>
<p begin="01:50:42.560" end="01:50:48.610" style="s2">very useful likewise with the</p>
<p begin="01:50:45.380" end="01:50:55.430" style="s2">hopefulness as opposed to the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:50:48.610" end="01:50:58.640" style="s2">naive bullshitting of ourselves there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:50:55.430" end="01:51:00.770" style="s2">a reason the major arcana and tarot</p>
<p begin="01:50:58.640" end="01:51:04.010" style="s2">starts with the fool and so there is</p>
<p begin="01:51:00.770" end="01:51:07.040" style="s2">always some aspect of having to just in</p>
<p begin="01:51:04.010" end="01:51:10.490" style="s2">some very real sense be naive enough to</p>
<p begin="01:51:07.040" end="01:51:13.430" style="s2">take the step off the cliff and often it</p>
<p begin="01:51:10.490" end="01:51:17.030" style="s2">seems more like how do we prevent</p>
<p begin="01:51:13.430" end="01:51:19.370" style="s2">needing to do that and more you know how</p>
<p begin="01:51:17.030" end="01:51:20.870" style="s2">do i how do I make sure to carry around</p>
<p begin="01:51:19.370" end="01:51:25.490" style="s2">the parachute or something you know</p>
<p begin="01:51:20.870" end="01:51:27.770" style="s2">something like that so and make that and</p>
<p begin="01:51:25.490" end="01:51:30.020" style="s2">that jump more pleasant and less</p>
<p begin="01:51:27.770" end="01:51:31.520" style="s2">dangerous we&#39;re at eight o&#39;clock why</p>
<p begin="01:51:30.020" end="01:51:33.710" style="s2">don&#39;t we do one more question for mark</p>
<p begin="01:51:31.520" end="01:51:35.360" style="s2">and then maybe the rest of the official</p>
<p begin="01:51:33.710" end="01:51:37.070" style="s2">questions at least we couldn&#39;t well so</p>
<p begin="01:51:35.360" end="01:51:38.000" style="s2">we&#39;ll have one more session probably a</p>
<p begin="01:51:37.070" end="01:51:41.080" style="s2">little shorter maybe an hour-long</p>
<p begin="01:51:38.000" end="01:51:45.050" style="s2">session I guess unless it takes off on</p>
<p begin="01:51:41.080" end="01:51:48.920" style="s2">diving into the dangers but mark why</p>
<p begin="01:51:45.050" end="01:51:51.320" style="s2">don&#39;t you ask your question sorry hey</p>
<p begin="01:51:48.920" end="01:51:52.970" style="s2">Nick I had to drop off for a call</p>
<p begin="01:51:51.320" end="01:51:55.430" style="s2">unfortunately so I might have missed</p>
<p begin="01:51:52.970" end="01:51:57.860" style="s2">this if you if you cover it but Benjamin</p>
<p begin="01:51:55.430" end="01:52:00.320" style="s2">Boyce did it recently did a talk with</p>
<p begin="01:51:57.860" end="01:52:02.690" style="s2">Paul Andrew clay and Jonathan pezzo and</p>
<p begin="01:52:00.320" end="01:52:04.280" style="s2">they covered a wide variety of topics</p>
<p begin="01:52:02.690" end="01:52:06.560" style="s2">really interesting talk I know it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:52:04.280" end="01:52:10.940" style="s2">posted in the in the voice channel text</p>
<p begin="01:52:06.560" end="01:52:12.230" style="s2">day a day ago or so and in that one of</p>
<p begin="01:52:10.940" end="01:52:14.990" style="s2">the things they were talking about that</p>
<p begin="01:52:12.230" end="01:52:18.950" style="s2">really struck me was they were talking</p>
<p begin="01:52:14.990" end="01:52:20.960" style="s2">about Obama and how he represented</p>
<p begin="01:52:18.950" end="01:52:22.850" style="s2">royalty to some extent and the</p>
<p begin="01:52:20.960" end="01:52:25.460" style="s2">relationship between like the</p>
<p begin="01:52:22.850" end="01:52:29.570" style="s2">unification of the UK around the royalty</p>
<p begin="01:52:25.460" end="01:52:31.460" style="s2">and that interaction with you know it</p>
<p begin="01:52:29.570" end="01:52:34.040" style="s2">seems to be like a cultic structure that</p>
<p begin="01:52:31.460" end="01:52:37.250" style="s2">interacts with other cultic structures</p>
<p begin="01:52:34.040" end="01:52:40.430" style="s2">and so I&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="01:52:37.250" end="01:52:43.920" style="s2">hierarchy of of cultic structures that</p>
<p begin="01:52:40.430" end="01:52:45.570" style="s2">interact in some ways</p>
<p begin="01:52:43.920" end="01:52:47.880" style="s2">and you know I don&#39;t know if you if you</p>
<p begin="01:52:45.570" end="01:52:49.440" style="s2">listened to that particular talk but you</p>
<p begin="01:52:47.880" end="01:52:51.510" style="s2">know what you thought of that concept in</p>
<p begin="01:52:49.440" end="01:52:54.060" style="s2">general where you have you have saved</p>
<p begin="01:52:51.510" end="01:52:56.429" style="s2">the state religion right that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:52:54.060" end="01:52:59.219" style="s2">that&#39;s one cult and then you have the</p>
<p begin="01:52:56.429" end="01:53:01.080" style="s2">the monarchy that&#39;s another cult that</p>
<p begin="01:52:59.219" end="01:53:03.090" style="s2">are operating sort of at the same level</p>
<p begin="01:53:01.080" end="01:53:05.730" style="s2">right they in theory at least have the</p>
<p begin="01:53:03.090" end="01:53:06.750" style="s2">same amount of power in some sense and</p>
<p begin="01:53:05.730" end="01:53:09.060" style="s2">then there&#39;s some relationship between</p>
<p begin="01:53:06.750" end="01:53:12.420" style="s2">them so I was just I was a comment on</p>
<p begin="01:53:09.060" end="01:53:15.179" style="s2">that yeah yeah again I think this gets</p>
<p begin="01:53:12.420" end="01:53:18.000" style="s2">into some of the argument I was making</p>
<p begin="01:53:15.179" end="01:53:21.980" style="s2">just about how like inevitable the this</p>
<p begin="01:53:18.000" end="01:53:26.460" style="s2">qualia of our sociological systems is</p>
<p begin="01:53:21.980" end="01:53:29.850" style="s2">and and how deeply it impacts and frames</p>
<p begin="01:53:26.460" end="01:53:32.520" style="s2">our phenomenology so yeah you know I</p>
<p begin="01:53:29.850" end="01:53:34.949" style="s2">don&#39;t know forever gonna create a system</p>
<p begin="01:53:32.520" end="01:53:37.410" style="s2">of government where we don&#39;t have that</p>
<p begin="01:53:34.949" end="01:53:40.410" style="s2">even if it&#39;s entirely ran by an AI we</p>
<p begin="01:53:37.410" end="01:53:46.260" style="s2">just start viewing the AI as you know</p>
<p begin="01:53:40.410" end="01:53:50.760" style="s2">a type of noble godlike creature and</p>
<p begin="01:53:46.260" end="01:53:54.270" style="s2">there is something very very deeply I</p>
<p begin="01:53:50.760" end="01:53:57.090" style="s2">think important about that role you know</p>
<p begin="01:53:54.270" end="01:54:01.650" style="s2">like the idea that the president is</p>
<p begin="01:53:57.090" end="01:54:04.760" style="s2">primarily there to make the proper you</p>
<p begin="01:54:01.650" end="01:54:07.830" style="s2">know judgment call on policy seems</p>
<p begin="01:54:04.760" end="01:54:09.780" style="s2">pretty deeply unrealistic it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:54:07.830" end="01:54:11.760" style="s2">lot of the other systems of our</p>
<p begin="01:54:09.780" end="01:54:14.820" style="s2">governments are what are carrying the</p>
<p begin="01:54:11.760" end="01:54:16.830" style="s2">weight of that and it seems like the</p>
<p begin="01:54:14.820" end="01:54:19.530" style="s2">presidents that we often hold in the</p>
<p begin="01:54:16.830" end="01:54:23.280" style="s2">highest regard are those that were able</p>
<p begin="01:54:19.530" end="01:54:26.940" style="s2">to meaningfully create a unified dream</p>
<p begin="01:54:23.280" end="01:54:31.100" style="s2">about what America represented so when</p>
<p begin="01:54:26.940" end="01:54:34.429" style="s2">we listen to JFK&#39;s you know speeches or</p>
<p begin="01:54:31.100" end="01:54:37.469" style="s2">you know I don&#39;t know read Lincoln or</p>
<p begin="01:54:34.429" end="01:54:41.040" style="s2">you know these people that were really</p>
<p begin="01:54:37.469" end="01:54:46.560" style="s2">powerfully able to create this dream for</p>
<p begin="01:54:41.040" end="01:54:50.310" style="s2">America I think it would be a great</p>
<p begin="01:54:46.560" end="01:54:53.940" style="s2">mistake to not realize how how extremely</p>
<p begin="01:54:50.310" end="01:54:55.929" style="s2">important that is and I think the degree</p>
<p begin="01:54:53.940" end="01:54:59.610" style="s2">to which we forget how am</p>
<p begin="01:54:55.929" end="01:55:00.820" style="s2">Fortin that is opens the door for more</p>
<p begin="01:54:59.610" end="01:55:03.699" style="s2">demagogic</p>
<p begin="01:55:00.820" end="01:55:05.979" style="s2">figures to manipulate and make use of</p>
<p begin="01:55:03.699" end="01:55:10.689" style="s2">that because we imagine ourselves free</p>
<p begin="01:55:05.979" end="01:55:13.439" style="s2">from yeah I don&#39;t know that commented on</p>
<p begin="01:55:10.689" end="01:55:14.949" style="s2">what you were getting at but yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:55:13.439" end="01:55:17.979" style="s2">agree</p>
<p begin="01:55:14.949" end="01:55:20.769" style="s2">I mean it is there a hierarchy of hope</p>
<p begin="01:55:17.979" end="01:55:22.719" style="s2">that&#39;s the religion still interrelate</p>
<p begin="01:55:20.769" end="01:55:26.139" style="s2">with the governments and they&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="01:55:22.719" end="01:55:27.789" style="s2">cults under your structure I believe I</p>
<p begin="01:55:26.139" end="01:55:28.780" style="s2">don&#39;t I don&#39;t I think I understand your</p>
<p begin="01:55:27.789" end="01:55:29.739" style="s2">structure pretty well even though I</p>
<p begin="01:55:28.780" end="01:55:32.709" style="s2">missed a good chunk of this</p>
<p begin="01:55:29.739" end="01:55:34.929" style="s2">unfortunately and so there seemed to be</p>
<p begin="01:55:32.709" end="01:55:37.689" style="s2">some relationships that that form</p>
<p begin="01:55:34.929" end="01:55:42.099" style="s2">between these cults based on the level</p>
<p begin="01:55:37.689" end="01:55:44.499" style="s2">at which they&#39;re controlling your your</p>
<p begin="01:55:42.099" end="01:55:46.780" style="s2">your ethos or your life I don&#39;t I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:55:44.499" end="01:55:49.090" style="s2">know how to because the right words so I</p>
<p begin="01:55:46.780" end="01:55:51.459" style="s2">like is there a hierarchy there is that</p>
<p begin="01:55:49.090" end="01:55:53.979" style="s2">or the diversity and think about that I</p>
<p begin="01:55:51.459" end="01:55:55.959" style="s2">think there is for the person though</p>
<p begin="01:55:53.979" end="01:55:57.760" style="s2">right so a religious persons gonna put</p>
<p begin="01:55:55.959" end="01:55:59.849" style="s2">God at the top of a hierarchy and</p>
<p begin="01:55:57.760" end="01:56:02.889" style="s2">government is supposed to be a sub</p>
<p begin="01:55:59.849" end="01:56:07.570" style="s2">representation principality underneath</p>
<p begin="01:56:02.889" end="01:56:10.780" style="s2">God in a secular frame a secularist</p>
<p begin="01:56:07.570" end="01:56:13.209" style="s2">might put science up there right and the</p>
<p begin="01:56:10.780" end="01:56:15.039" style="s2">government should be purely and only</p>
<p begin="01:56:13.209" end="01:56:17.260" style="s2">informed by science and should be</p>
<p begin="01:56:15.039" end="01:56:19.059" style="s2">subjugated to whatever science says or</p>
<p begin="01:56:17.260" end="01:56:19.929" style="s2">they might be a different type of</p>
<p begin="01:56:19.059" end="01:56:22.989" style="s2">secularist</p>
<p begin="01:56:19.929" end="01:56:24.849" style="s2">and they put politics up at the top and</p>
<p begin="01:56:22.989" end="01:56:28.179" style="s2">science that should be subjugated to</p>
<p begin="01:56:24.849" end="01:56:30.130" style="s2">politics in some regard that interplay</p>
<p begin="01:56:28.179" end="01:56:32.289" style="s2">has to play out otherwise you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:56:30.130" end="01:56:35.079" style="s2">an ethics system for guiding the</p>
<p begin="01:56:32.289" end="01:56:37.510" style="s2">investigation of science so right</p>
<p begin="01:56:35.079" end="01:56:39.909" style="s2">there&#39;s complicated issues there and how</p>
<p begin="01:56:37.510" end="01:56:42.429" style="s2">a person hierarchically formats that I</p>
<p begin="01:56:39.909" end="01:56:44.619" style="s2">don&#39;t know I think we could probably</p>
<p begin="01:56:42.429" end="01:56:46.719" style="s2">make an argument that at certain times</p>
<p begin="01:56:44.619" end="01:56:49.929" style="s2">through history there&#39;s a general</p>
<p begin="01:56:46.719" end="01:56:52.570" style="s2">hierarchy that most people accept as the</p>
<p begin="01:56:49.929" end="01:56:55.179" style="s2">proper one I don&#39;t know if we can fully</p>
<p begin="01:56:52.570" end="01:56:58.209" style="s2">encapsulate it in our current age in a</p>
<p begin="01:56:55.179" end="01:57:00.070" style="s2">generalized sense so much as in a</p>
<p begin="01:56:58.209" end="01:57:02.679" style="s2">personal sense so the person themselves</p>
<p begin="01:57:00.070" end="01:57:04.530" style="s2">will hierarchically order their cultic</p>
<p begin="01:57:02.679" end="01:57:06.810" style="s2">affiliations</p>
<p begin="01:57:04.530" end="01:57:08.670" style="s2">oh wow I didn&#39;t yeah I wasn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="01:57:06.810" end="01:57:11.010" style="s2">thinking of it from that from that level</p>
<p begin="01:57:08.670" end="01:57:13.110" style="s2">in a sense because I fell into what I</p>
<p begin="01:57:11.010" end="01:57:16.740" style="s2">now realized as a small trap that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:57:13.110" end="01:57:18.420" style="s2">been trying to avoid so that&#39;s odd so</p>
<p begin="01:57:16.740" end="01:57:20.760" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting that you did you</p>
<p begin="01:57:18.420" end="01:57:22.830" style="s2">frame it that way so is it is it it is</p>
<p begin="01:57:20.760" end="01:57:25.740" style="s2">it fair to say that then an unhealthy</p>
<p begin="01:57:22.830" end="01:57:29.400" style="s2">cult is an identity collapse into the</p>
<p begin="01:57:25.740" end="01:57:32.190" style="s2">cult and that a healthy cult would allow</p>
<p begin="01:57:29.400" end="01:57:35.880" style="s2">for other cult identities to exist or</p>
<p begin="01:57:32.190" end="01:57:39.480" style="s2">coexist I&#39;d say one of the major</p>
<p begin="01:57:35.880" end="01:57:42.930" style="s2">features of a healthy cult is its</p>
<p begin="01:57:39.480" end="01:57:46.380" style="s2">ability to consume and interact with</p>
<p begin="01:57:42.930" end="01:57:48.750" style="s2">other cults in the same way that what</p>
<p begin="01:57:46.380" end="01:57:52.820" style="s2">makes a healthy person is the ability to</p>
<p begin="01:57:48.750" end="01:57:52.820" style="s2">eat something other than our own shit</p>
<p begin="01:57:52.850" end="01:57:59.430" style="s2">right so when you get isolationist cult</p>
<p begin="01:57:56.490" end="01:58:03.420" style="s2">cult soar cultures quite literally if</p>
<p begin="01:57:59.430" end="01:58:06.600" style="s2">you map it on to your body right you</p>
<p begin="01:58:03.420" end="01:58:09.630" style="s2">you&#39;re you are consuming only what you</p>
<p begin="01:58:06.600" end="01:58:12.030" style="s2">produce right right you&#39;re not consuming</p>
<p begin="01:58:09.630" end="01:58:14.310" style="s2">anything from other external sources and</p>
<p begin="01:58:12.030" end="01:58:18.900" style="s2">I think this is actually really obvious</p>
<p begin="01:58:14.310" end="01:58:22.560" style="s2">when we watch worldviews how they</p>
<p begin="01:58:18.900" end="01:58:24.060" style="s2">mimetic aliy move right so for example</p>
<p begin="01:58:22.560" end="01:58:26.760" style="s2">one of the reasons I think tosh.o is</p>
<p begin="01:58:24.060" end="01:58:30.120" style="s2">such a strong voice right now in the</p>
<p begin="01:58:26.760" end="01:58:32.430" style="s2">group that watches him is because he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:58:30.120" end="01:58:35.040" style="s2">constantly interfacing with the world</p>
<p begin="01:58:32.430" end="01:58:37.530" style="s2">he&#39;s not trying to go all the way back</p>
<p begin="01:58:35.040" end="01:58:39.540" style="s2">in time and just say ignore the whole</p>
<p begin="01:58:37.530" end="01:58:41.880" style="s2">outside world just believe in the</p>
<p begin="01:58:39.540" end="01:58:44.940" style="s2">pre-modern frame he&#39;s trying to show you</p>
<p begin="01:58:41.880" end="01:58:48.810" style="s2">how the pre-modern frame applies to the</p>
<p begin="01:58:44.940" end="01:58:51.420" style="s2">postmodern frame and I consider that an</p>
<p begin="01:58:48.810" end="01:58:54.450" style="s2">aspect of what makes a cultic structure</p>
<p begin="01:58:51.420" end="01:58:57.060" style="s2">healthy if they have to remember that</p>
<p begin="01:58:54.450" end="01:58:58.830" style="s2">one I think so when you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:58:57.060" end="01:59:11.580" style="s2">consuming what you&#39;ve been producing I</p>
<p begin="01:58:58.830" end="01:59:14.310" style="s2">know it&#39;s a great way to say that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:59:11.580" end="01:59:17.370" style="s2">probably a great way to end another</p>
<p begin="01:59:14.310" end="01:59:17.960" style="s2">fascinating stream thank you so much</p>
<p begin="01:59:17.370" end="01:59:20.960" style="s2">Nick</p>
<p begin="01:59:17.960" end="01:59:22.969" style="s2">I mean yeah I feel like we can go on and</p>
<p begin="01:59:20.960" end="01:59:28.070" style="s2">on and on and on this there&#39;s so much a</p>
<p begin="01:59:22.969" end="01:59:30.170" style="s2">lot of material yeah yeah and second</p>
<p begin="01:59:28.070" end="01:59:34.850" style="s2">what people said last time I mean yeah</p>
<p begin="01:59:30.170" end="01:59:38.060" style="s2">you got to read the book there&#39;s so we</p>
<p begin="01:59:34.850" end="01:59:39.350" style="s2">will continue this conversation next</p>
<p begin="01:59:38.060" end="01:59:41.420" style="s2">week I guess</p>
<p begin="01:59:39.350" end="01:59:45.230" style="s2">well we&#39;ll finish it up with with part</p>
<p begin="01:59:41.420" end="01:59:47.210" style="s2">three and really dive into the the</p>
<p begin="01:59:45.230" end="01:59:49.430" style="s2">problems of things to avoid and the less</p>
<p begin="01:59:47.210" end="01:59:52.640" style="s2">it really the lessons for us here I mean</p>
<p begin="01:59:49.430" end="01:59:54.469" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s again what&#39;s very high in</p>
<p begin="01:59:52.640" end="01:59:57.500" style="s2">my mind how do we avoid falling into</p>
<p begin="01:59:54.469" end="02:00:00.469" style="s2">these pitfalls you know not just setting</p>
<p begin="01:59:57.500" end="02:00:03.230" style="s2">up the yellow and red for what we would</p>
<p begin="02:00:00.469" end="02:00:06.500" style="s2">expect from somebody else but what we</p>
<p begin="02:00:03.230" end="02:00:10.850" style="s2">would expect from ourselves so you know</p>
<p begin="02:00:06.500" end="02:00:12.290" style="s2">so so that&#39;ll be fantastic and thank you</p>
<p begin="02:00:10.850" end="02:00:16.160" style="s2">so much everyone for being here and</p>
