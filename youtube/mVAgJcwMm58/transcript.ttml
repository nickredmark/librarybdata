<p begin="00:02:05.360" end="00:02:10.060" style="s2">might switch pivot to just kind of an</p>

<p begin="00:02:10.060" end="00:02:16.129" style="s2">but we have 90 minutes here in total so</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.330" end="00:02:18.950" style="s2">that being said Conrad I&#39;m going to hand</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.129" end="00:02:23.000" style="s2">it to you you&#39;re in mute right now you</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.950" end="00:02:25.159" style="s2">know hi good to see you all so I want to</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.000" end="00:02:27.170" style="s2">clarify before I start and I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.159" end="00:02:30.260" style="s2">clarify this subsequently within the</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.170" end="00:02:32.269" style="s2">presentation the</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.260" end="00:02:35.480" style="s2">well two things first of all I&#39;m not by</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.269" end="00:02:38.150" style="s2">any means an expert in stoicism you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.480" end="00:02:40.730" style="s2">modern European philosophy is my area of</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.150" end="00:02:43.969" style="s2">specialty so you know there if there any</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.730" end="00:02:46.819" style="s2">errors or inaccuracies in terms of my</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.969" end="00:02:49.359" style="s2">treatment of stoicism or or epicureanism</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.819" end="00:02:51.620" style="s2">for that matter I welcome Corrections</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.359" end="00:02:53.090" style="s2">the second thing I just want to say is</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.620" end="00:02:54.829" style="s2">that I&#39;ve kind of set this up as a bit</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.090" end="00:02:57.079" style="s2">of a thought experiment with which I</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.829" end="00:03:02.349" style="s2">intend to make a a slightly different</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.079" end="00:03:04.879" style="s2">philosophical point about the appeal to</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.349" end="00:03:08.090" style="s2">biology in order to sustain</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.879" end="00:03:13.489" style="s2">philosophical structures which we&#39;ll get</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.090" end="00:03:18.349" style="s2">into but or notions of the few SACEUR</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.489" end="00:03:19.909" style="s2">nature as it were but but again it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.349" end="00:03:24.769" style="s2">actually I don&#39;t mean to suggest</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.909" end="00:03:26.959" style="s2">Peterson is a stoic right that is not</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.769" end="00:03:28.069" style="s2">the function you know I want to I want</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.959" end="00:03:30.049" style="s2">to play around with these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.069" end="00:03:32.450" style="s2">concepts right and experiment with them</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.049" end="00:03:33.859" style="s2">you know and of course it&#39;s the nature</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.450" end="00:03:36.109" style="s2">of these sort of comparisons that you</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.859" end="00:03:37.940" style="s2">can say well someone&#39;s you know X much</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.109" end="00:03:38.840" style="s2">like this or X much not like this you</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.940" end="00:03:42.109" style="s2">know there&#39;s certainly a level of</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.840" end="00:03:44.810" style="s2">variability and how that functions so</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.109" end="00:03:47.150" style="s2">with all that said I want to I built a</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.810" end="00:03:58.729" style="s2">slideshow so I want to bring up the</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.150" end="00:04:02.169" style="s2">slideshow see this okay so you can see</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.729" end="00:04:06.970" style="s2">my screen here there we go</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.169" end="00:04:06.970" style="s2">everyone can see yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.900" end="00:04:22.260" style="s2">so here we go we have the we have Marx&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.760" end="00:04:25.120" style="s2">Epicureanism and Peterson&#39;s stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.260" end="00:04:26.560" style="s2">with typical rigor I just totally built</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.120" end="00:04:31.570" style="s2">this in kind of the default PowerPoint</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.560" end="00:04:38.729" style="s2">format so don&#39;t expect any great sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.570" end="00:04:41.410" style="s2">technical pyrotechnics press like okay</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.729" end="00:04:45.639" style="s2">so I just want to begin by discussing a</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.410" end="00:04:48.580" style="s2">little bit the very basically just the</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.639" end="00:04:50.800" style="s2">structure of stoicism we see that</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.580" end="00:04:55.450" style="s2">stoicism founded in the early early</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.800" end="00:04:57.880" style="s2">third century BC by authen founded in</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.450" end="00:05:01.720" style="s2">early that early third century BC Athens</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.880" end="00:05:04.300" style="s2">by Xena Oh Satyam it&#39;s not a body of</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.720" end="00:05:08.979" style="s2">knowledge but a practice or exercise</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.300" end="00:05:11.320" style="s2">excuses and in stoic physics only</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.979" end="00:05:13.570" style="s2">corporal bodies and I&#39;ll start with the</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.320" end="00:05:15.580" style="s2">physics in stoic physics only corporal</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.570" end="00:05:19.270" style="s2">bodies can act upon things or are</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.580" end="00:05:21.460" style="s2">existent in a way though in incorporeal</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.270" end="00:05:25.539" style="s2">things like time place or saleable &#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.460" end="00:05:27.690" style="s2">are conceived of as subsystem and for</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.539" end="00:05:30.400" style="s2">this reason the cosmic life force of god</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.690" end="00:05:33.400" style="s2">is conceived of in a certain way in</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.400" end="00:05:36.639" style="s2">biological terms as a kind of logo so</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.400" end="00:05:39.720" style="s2">Numa that contains the sperm or seed of</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.639" end="00:05:42.280" style="s2">the world&#39;s develop and in this</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.720" end="00:05:44.289" style="s2">structure it&#39;s the rational agency of</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.280" end="00:05:45.970" style="s2">God that structures the the passive and</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.289" end="00:05:48.910" style="s2">activity of matter right so the the no</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.970" end="00:05:50.770" style="s2">the Numa or the logos you know is</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.910" end="00:05:53.680" style="s2">responsible for the arrangement of</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.770" end="00:05:55.750" style="s2">matter in that way this might sound like</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.680" end="00:05:58.300" style="s2">when you talk about the the role played</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.750" end="00:06:00.160" style="s2">in structuring the universe or matter by</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.300" end="00:06:01.270" style="s2">the logos through the Numa this might</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.160" end="00:06:03.760" style="s2">make it sound like the Stoics are</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.270" end="00:06:06.639" style="s2">deterministic but actually they had a</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.760" end="00:06:08.410" style="s2">more complex causal structure so they</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.639" end="00:06:11.260" style="s2">have notions of preliminary causes</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.410" end="00:06:13.240" style="s2">sustaining causes proximate causes you</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.260" end="00:06:14.770" style="s2">can&#39;t associate them with a simple kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.240" end="00:06:16.120" style="s2">of anticipate causality and we see that</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.770" end="00:06:18.640" style="s2">with Aristotle to write with formal</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.120" end="00:06:20.470" style="s2">causality final causality Express formal</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.640" end="00:06:20.770" style="s2">causality final causality efficient</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.470" end="00:06:24.940" style="s2">cause</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.770" end="00:06:26.470" style="s2">and so on you know that it&#39;s not based</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.940" end="00:06:32.020" style="s2">on a system of simple and distinct</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.470" end="00:06:34.659" style="s2">causality for the Stoics the mind is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.020" end="00:06:37.330" style="s2">rational commanding faculty that can</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.659" end="00:06:38.909" style="s2">elect to assent or not to rational</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.330" end="00:06:41.470" style="s2">impressions so here we get into the fun</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.909" end="00:06:43.539" style="s2">you know kind of moral implications a</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.470" end="00:06:44.889" style="s2">little bit a rational impression</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.539" end="00:06:47.650" style="s2">something that can be exhibited in</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.889" end="00:06:49.569" style="s2">language and for something to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.650" end="00:06:55.560" style="s2">signified there must be a signification</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.569" end="00:06:59.830" style="s2">a signifier and a name there so where is</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.560" end="00:07:03.789" style="s2">the where as the the the this the</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.830" end="00:07:09.759" style="s2">signified is incorporeal assailable can</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.789" end="00:07:11.560" style="s2">be judged as true or false well these</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.759" end="00:07:14.199" style="s2">these this sort of refers to the the way</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.560" end="00:07:16.060" style="s2">that simple samples or propositions work</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.199" end="00:07:18.819" style="s2">the Stoics also had to develop a theory</p>

<p begin="00:07:24.840" end="00:07:28.840" style="s2">ideally one should only assent to</p>

<p begin="00:07:28.840" end="00:07:32.639" style="s2">impressions which are secure and</p>

<p begin="00:07:35.139" end="00:07:38.409" style="s2">if you look at the the debate between</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.340" end="00:07:40.810" style="s2">the the Stoics and the skeptics a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.409" end="00:07:45.819" style="s2">it turned around well what would it mean</p>

<p begin="00:07:45.819" end="00:07:49.599" style="s2">rationally demonstrable in language so</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.550" end="00:07:51.520" style="s2">that we could call it a cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.599" end="00:07:53.229" style="s2">impression so basically you have the</p>

<p begin="00:07:56.770" end="00:08:00.729" style="s2">impression is right and that&#39;s where you</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.930" end="00:08:02.110" style="s2">kind of get into this logical sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.729" end="00:08:04.860" style="s2">sub structure right and why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.110" end="00:08:07.029" style="s2">important right</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.860" end="00:08:08.380" style="s2">so very very developed right and you</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.029" end="00:08:10.270" style="s2">know I&#39;ve been there caricatures of</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.380" end="00:08:12.340" style="s2">stoicism that are used but you see a</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.270" end="00:08:17.500" style="s2">very very developed kind of sensibility</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.340" end="00:08:19.060" style="s2">at work there now in stoic ethics the</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.500" end="00:08:21.789" style="s2">only things that are truly good are</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.060" end="00:08:25.180" style="s2">human virtues right wisdom justice</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.789" end="00:08:27.759" style="s2">courage and so on but awareness of these</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.180" end="00:08:29.349" style="s2">has to progress through a process in</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.759" end="00:08:31.330" style="s2">which we start with basic needs like</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.349" end="00:08:34.300" style="s2">food and shelter and then we acquire</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.330" end="00:08:36.969" style="s2">moral virtues</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.300" end="00:08:40.209" style="s2">and these these sort of lower-level</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.969" end="00:08:42.669" style="s2">needs like you know food and shelter</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.209" end="00:08:44.110" style="s2">they&#39;re classified as indifference so</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.669" end="00:08:47.410" style="s2">while there might be good most of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.110" end="00:08:52.660" style="s2">time exceptions can nevertheless exist</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.410" end="00:08:58.379" style="s2">right so you know I mean for example</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.660" end="00:09:01.300" style="s2">like you know most of the time it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.379" end="00:09:04.480" style="s2">desirable to have shelter but if you</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.300" end="00:09:06.129" style="s2">imagine okay you&#39;re you&#39;re Hitler well</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.480" end="00:09:07.809" style="s2">if you having shelter it could be is</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.129" end="00:09:09.610" style="s2">perpetuating some greater harm then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.809" end="00:09:11.079" style="s2">not good for you to have shelter right</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.610" end="00:09:15.459" style="s2">so you know there&#39;s just there&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.079" end="00:09:17.529" style="s2">a generality that&#39;s use that right and</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.459" end="00:09:19.420" style="s2">helping to structure our preferences is</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.529" end="00:09:21.639" style="s2">the rationale character of nature very</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.420" end="00:09:24.009" style="s2">important so it&#39;s best is to live in</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.639" end="00:09:27.399" style="s2">accordance with nature though exceptions</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.009" end="00:09:29.170" style="s2">will sometimes arise as when you would</p>

<p begin="00:09:29.170" end="00:09:35.110" style="s2">else alive and this is this is what I</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.879" end="00:09:38.429" style="s2">said about an exception right to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.110" end="00:09:42.369" style="s2">good of the the basic needs of survival</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.429" end="00:09:43.899" style="s2">as with the Socratic spirit ease or</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.369" end="00:09:50.230" style="s2">technique concerned with life in general</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.899" end="00:09:51.939" style="s2">is assimilated to rationality so like</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.230" end="00:09:53.769" style="s2">their the idea here is that you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.939" end="00:09:55.809" style="s2">there is no disassociation between</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.769" end="00:09:58.199" style="s2">rationality and virtue right you see</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.809" end="00:10:01.929" style="s2">this with the idea of accenting -</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.199" end="00:10:05.619" style="s2">verifiable cognitive impressions right</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.929" end="00:10:08.619" style="s2">verifiable rational impressions that you</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.619" end="00:10:10.449" style="s2">know to be rational is also to have you</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.619" end="00:10:12.189" style="s2">know an adequate moral framework right</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.449" end="00:10:14.410" style="s2">and in a way it&#39;s even more so I was</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.189" end="00:10:16.299" style="s2">saying then with the</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.410" end="00:10:18.220" style="s2">than with the Socratic because you have</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.299" end="00:10:20.529" style="s2">no tripartite theory of the soul so</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.220" end="00:10:22.629" style="s2">there&#39;s a very very rational dimension</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.529" end="00:10:25.929" style="s2">right - to stoicism in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.629" end="00:10:27.670" style="s2">functions okay so now I&#39;m going to talk</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.929" end="00:10:29.290" style="s2">a little bit of epicureanism sorry I</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.670" end="00:10:31.860" style="s2">realize this is a lot I hope I hope it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.290" end="00:10:35.369" style="s2">not you know too much for you but</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.860" end="00:10:37.509" style="s2">epicureanism is maybe a little easier</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.369" end="00:10:40.179" style="s2">epoch Epicureanism shares</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.509" end="00:10:42.129" style="s2">Epicurus name it is like stoicism a</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.179" end="00:10:44.980" style="s2">long-standing tradition that started in</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.129" end="00:10:46.509" style="s2">ancient Greece in the 4th century BC and</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.980" end="00:10:47.950" style="s2">that was carried on to ancient Rome</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.509" end="00:10:50.130" style="s2">where the crease</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.950" end="00:10:52.990" style="s2">was actually it&#39;s most famous proponent</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.130" end="00:10:54.640" style="s2">and like stoicism it was also a popular</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.990" end="00:10:56.110" style="s2">or practical philosophy so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.640" end="00:10:58.930" style="s2">actually really important to note about</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.110" end="00:11:02.190" style="s2">both Epicureanism is Sohus ism is that</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.930" end="00:11:04.840" style="s2">these were not purely sort of academic</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.190" end="00:11:06.610" style="s2">projects these were actually you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.840" end="00:11:11.970" style="s2">philosophies that people use to to guide</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.610" end="00:11:14.140" style="s2">their lives so interesting in that way</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.970" end="00:11:17.380" style="s2">here we&#39;ll focus a bit on the ideas of</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.140" end="00:11:19.090" style="s2">about the curious himself so the</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.380" end="00:11:21.220" style="s2">physical theory of Epicurus builds on</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.090" end="00:11:22.660" style="s2">the early one of Democritus and pausing</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.220" end="00:11:25.090" style="s2">the positing that the world is comprised</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.660" end="00:11:26.920" style="s2">of material atoms but his solid</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.090" end="00:11:28.660" style="s2">indivisible particulars below the</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.920" end="00:11:32.500" style="s2">threshold of visions that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.660" end="00:11:34.810" style="s2">space void between Epicurus method is</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.500" end="00:11:36.310" style="s2">largely deductive he posits an infinity</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.810" end="00:11:37.780" style="s2">of atoms because without the nature</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.310" end="00:11:39.460" style="s2">would regress nothing and the proof of</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.780" end="00:11:41.500" style="s2">their statuses bodies lies on their</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.460" end="00:11:43.300" style="s2">continuity with the visible structure of</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.500" end="00:11:44.770" style="s2">the world so again if you think about it</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.300" end="00:11:46.720" style="s2">right this is like your Turtles all the</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.770" end="00:11:48.160" style="s2">way down kind of thing like if you think</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.720" end="00:11:51.280" style="s2">about it there has to be a basic</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.160" end="00:11:53.710" style="s2">constituent of the material world right</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.280" end="00:11:55.600" style="s2">and that&#39;s how you logically deduce the</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.710" end="00:11:57.930" style="s2">presence of atoms right so it&#39;s a kind</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.600" end="00:12:00.760" style="s2">of logical experiment that&#39;s performed</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.930" end="00:12:06.280" style="s2">from the standpoint of first person</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.760" end="00:12:08.350" style="s2">observation while atoms function</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.280" end="00:12:10.660" style="s2">mechanistically for Epicurus they are</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.350" end="00:12:12.880" style="s2">unlike for unlike for Democritus capable</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.660" end="00:12:14.020" style="s2">of swerving in a determinate manner so</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.880" end="00:12:16.900" style="s2">Democritus had a very sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.020" end="00:12:19.210" style="s2">mechanistic conception of atoms but</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.900" end="00:12:21.910" style="s2">Epicurus altered Democritus conception</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.210" end="00:12:25.420" style="s2">of atoms by saying that they had a</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.910" end="00:12:28.150" style="s2">certain there was a certain margin in</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.420" end="00:12:31.440" style="s2">which they could swerve right you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.150" end="00:12:31.440" style="s2">in terms of the voids they&#39;re moving in</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.280" end="00:12:37.600" style="s2">four Epicurus the souls comprised of</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.690" end="00:12:40.300" style="s2">atoms which for him is proved by the</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.600" end="00:12:42.880" style="s2">fact that only corporal entities can be</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.300" end="00:12:45.130" style="s2">can move or be moved so in other words</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.880" end="00:12:48.190" style="s2">like the the changeability of the soul</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.130" end="00:12:49.990" style="s2">right and its capacity for sensation</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.190" end="00:12:52.020" style="s2">you know proves the fact that the soul</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.990" end="00:12:55.020" style="s2">must actually be material or corporal</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.020" end="00:12:55.020" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.000" end="00:13:01.820" style="s2">and by the way we should remember when</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.410" end="00:13:03.230" style="s2">we when you talk about the soul in</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.820" end="00:13:04.670" style="s2">ancient Greece this is different than</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.230" end="00:13:05.990" style="s2">now because now we tend we tend to think</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.670" end="00:13:08.120" style="s2">almost definitionally of something</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.990" end="00:13:10.700" style="s2">incorporeal which reflects the influence</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.120" end="00:13:12.950" style="s2">of the Christian tradition but like when</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.700" end="00:13:14.810" style="s2">Aristotle uses the term soul for example</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.950" end="00:13:16.790" style="s2">he means like its anima which is just</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.810" end="00:13:18.950" style="s2">principle of animation so actually when</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.790" end="00:13:20.630" style="s2">we often use the translation soul I</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.950" end="00:13:23.180" style="s2">don&#39;t like the translation soul I prefer</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.630" end="00:13:25.160" style="s2">enema because I think the problem when</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.180" end="00:13:26.930" style="s2">we use the word soul is we give it a</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.160" end="00:13:29.330" style="s2">spiritualist Association which it</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.930" end="00:13:31.970" style="s2">sometimes has in ancient Greece um but</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.330" end="00:13:34.100" style="s2">it&#39;s much more open-ended right it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.970" end="00:13:36.760" style="s2">princess it&#39;s the sorry not the princess</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.100" end="00:13:38.630" style="s2">it&#39;s simply the the the nucleus</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.760" end="00:13:44.300" style="s2">responsible for the animation of life</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.630" end="00:13:46.400" style="s2">right so this this theory of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.300" end="00:13:48.980" style="s2">materiality of the soul leads</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.400" end="00:13:51.290" style="s2">Epicurus to two conclusions one is that</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.980" end="00:13:52.940" style="s2">the atomic composition of the body is</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.290" end="00:13:55.550" style="s2">too delicate to be transmitted to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.940" end="00:13:56.870" style="s2">afterlife and two that the material soul</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.550" end="00:13:58.970" style="s2">is only responsive to physical</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.870" end="00:14:02.120" style="s2">impressions such as pain and pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.970" end="00:14:04.190" style="s2">right so we have on one hand this idea</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.120" end="00:14:06.230" style="s2">that the afterlife cannot exist because</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.190" end="00:14:09.470" style="s2">the the soul comes from a particular</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.230" end="00:14:10.910" style="s2">composition amount of of atoms right so</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.470" end="00:14:16.130" style="s2">how could you how could that get to the</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.910" end="00:14:17.180" style="s2">afterlife right if you know you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.130" end="00:14:20.330" style="s2">it&#39;d have to sort of be magically</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.180" end="00:14:21.260" style="s2">transported or something right and he</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.330" end="00:14:25.220" style="s2">also you know there&#39;s a certain</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.260" end="00:14:30.290" style="s2">secularism here qualified secularism in</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.220" end="00:14:33.620" style="s2">which he he points out that you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.290" end="00:14:35.240" style="s2">what defines the soul is what is</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.620" end="00:14:38.000" style="s2">palpable to us on a kind of sensual</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.240" end="00:14:39.500" style="s2">level right so the sensations of pain</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.000" end="00:14:41.270" style="s2">and pleasure right being very very</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.500" end="00:14:43.880" style="s2">tangible are prior to part of this</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.270" end="00:14:48.260" style="s2">material metabolism right in which the</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.880" end="00:14:50.120" style="s2">soul functions in this context ideas</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.260" end="00:14:51.980" style="s2">such as those of the gods come from thin</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.120" end="00:14:53.810" style="s2">films of atoms which are internalized by</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.980" end="00:14:55.310" style="s2">the soul giving rise to mental</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.810" end="00:14:57.050" style="s2">impressions which aren&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.310" end="00:14:57.860" style="s2">correspondent so this is very</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.050" end="00:14:59.860" style="s2">interesting right</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.860" end="00:15:03.170" style="s2">like part of the epoch here an idea here</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.860" end="00:15:07.100" style="s2">is that and and you can actually see a</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.170" end="00:15:08.920" style="s2">strong parallel with them with the with</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.100" end="00:15:12.230" style="s2">the work of David Hume in this respect</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.920" end="00:15:12.800" style="s2">but there&#39;s this idea that the soul</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.230" end="00:15:15.440" style="s2">internal</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.800" end="00:15:16.700" style="s2">atoms that come from diverse sources and</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.440" end="00:15:21.560" style="s2">then it manifests them as the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.700" end="00:15:24.529" style="s2">the gods right but again that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.560" end="00:15:26.029" style="s2">mean that the gods exist right but</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.529" end="00:15:27.260" style="s2">actually Epicurious didn&#39;t dismiss the</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.029" end="00:15:29.209" style="s2">existence of the gods</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.260" end="00:15:31.820" style="s2">he just claimed that by the very nature</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.209" end="00:15:34.339" style="s2">of their perfection they would have no</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.820" end="00:15:38.209" style="s2">need to intervene in human affairs right</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.339" end="00:15:42.700" style="s2">so classic you know kind of theological</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.209" end="00:15:45.920" style="s2">conundrum here right you know why would</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.700" end="00:15:48.140" style="s2">God have any compulsion to intervene in</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.920" end="00:15:49.640" style="s2">the world if he&#39;s so perfect that you</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.140" end="00:15:54.649" style="s2">know whatever it should already be okay</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.640" end="00:15:56.240" style="s2">right the soul has for the Epicurus is a</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.649" end="00:15:59.420" style="s2">rational and a non rational component</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.240" end="00:16:00.890" style="s2">and the former must be used to judge how</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.420" end="00:16:04.310" style="s2">to pursue the acquisition of pleasure or</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.890" end="00:16:11.510" style="s2">pain right so again a very you know kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.310" end="00:16:13.579" style="s2">of sensualist basis there are three</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.510" end="00:16:18.470" style="s2">kinds of desire for Epicurus ones that</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.579" end="00:16:22.279" style="s2">are natural unnatural but unnatural but</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.470" end="00:16:23.930" style="s2">desirable and empty natural refers to</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.279" end="00:16:24.730" style="s2">human necessities like health and</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.930" end="00:16:27.110" style="s2">happiness</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.730" end="00:16:30.230" style="s2">unnatural refers to unnecessary</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.110" end="00:16:32.240" style="s2">amenities like good food or drink an</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.230" end="00:16:34.279" style="s2">empty refers to extraneous conundrums</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.240" end="00:16:35.570" style="s2">like fear and death right so you have</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.279" end="00:16:38.450" style="s2">three categories right yeah you have</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.570" end="00:16:40.700" style="s2">your your stuff you you you need right</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.450" end="00:16:42.320" style="s2">you have you stuff that that&#39;s nice that</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.700" end="00:16:45.380" style="s2">facilitates pleasure but isn&#39;t necessary</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.320" end="00:16:47.410" style="s2">and then you have stuff that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.380" end="00:16:49.760" style="s2">really matter right like fear of death</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.410" end="00:16:54.020" style="s2">and what maybe we&#39;ll get into this in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.760" end="00:16:55.040" style="s2">minute but for the Epicureans because</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.020" end="00:16:57.110" style="s2">they didn&#39;t believe in the afterlife</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.040" end="00:16:59.060" style="s2">fear of death was totally it&#39;s like why</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.110" end="00:17:01.100" style="s2">would you worry about death when you</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.060" end="00:17:02.930" style="s2">know you&#39;re not gonna know what happens</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.100" end="00:17:05.360" style="s2">when you die right it&#39;s a dumb thing to</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.930" end="00:17:06.800" style="s2">worry about okay so again you can see</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.360" end="00:17:09.470" style="s2">the critique of a certain critique of</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.800" end="00:17:11.120" style="s2">metaphysics very interesting right a</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.470" end="00:17:15.189" style="s2">very very early critique of metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.120" end="00:17:15.189" style="s2">that&#39;s being posited by the Epicureans</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.329" end="00:17:20.449" style="s2">the swerve itself the existence of it</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.220" end="00:17:22.939" style="s2">permits the delegation of a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.449" end="00:17:24.679" style="s2">qualified human freedom right because if</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.939" end="00:17:25.970" style="s2">if atoms can swerve that means that the</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.679" end="00:17:26.670" style="s2">atoms within our soul or not just</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.970" end="00:17:30.540" style="s2">following determine</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.670" end="00:17:32.130" style="s2">cicadas right that we actually have a</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.540" end="00:17:40.950" style="s2">certain kind of freedom that&#39;s bestowed</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.130" end="00:17:43.470" style="s2">to us okay wait okay now in epicurean</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.950" end="00:17:45.060" style="s2">epicurean Epicurus social theory early</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.470" end="00:17:47.040" style="s2">egalitarian society is defined by</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.060" end="00:17:50.220" style="s2">scarcity were then replaced by autocrats</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.040" end="00:17:52.410" style="s2">who were then overthrown in favor of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.220" end="00:17:53.850" style="s2">rule of law this is I would say on an</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.410" end="00:17:55.830" style="s2">anthropological level this holds up</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.850" end="00:18:00.480" style="s2">pretty well by the way</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.830" end="00:18:02.190" style="s2">so again prior to the creation of like</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.480" end="00:18:04.920" style="s2">agricultural surpluses you had kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.190" end="00:18:07.680" style="s2">relatively comparatively speaking</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.920" end="00:18:11.220" style="s2">harmonious subsistence societies then</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.680" end="00:18:16.590" style="s2">you have autocrats who emerge because</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.220" end="00:18:18.330" style="s2">they appropriate surpluses then in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.590" end="00:18:20.700" style="s2">context of ancient Greece for example</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.330" end="00:18:22.680" style="s2">you had the implementation of a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.700" end="00:18:26.940" style="s2">qualified democracy or Republican</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.680" end="00:18:29.070" style="s2">notions right so an effort to allow</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.940" end="00:18:30.270" style="s2">forms of public deliberation right so</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.070" end="00:18:34.440" style="s2">very interesting right it&#39;s a very very</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.270" end="00:18:37.110" style="s2">sophisticated social theory right with</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.440" end="00:18:41.730" style="s2">the rule of law right with the formation</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.110" end="00:18:46.320" style="s2">of you know these sort of more organized</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.730" end="00:18:47.580" style="s2">societies with the rule of Locke and the</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.320" end="00:18:48.990" style="s2">development of systems of punishment</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.580" end="00:18:54.900" style="s2">that obstructed the acquisition of</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.990" end="00:18:55.650" style="s2">pleasure right this in turn colored the</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.900" end="00:18:57.420" style="s2">view of the gods</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.650" end="00:18:59.100" style="s2">whereas early religious notions seem to</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.420" end="00:19:01.440" style="s2">emerge out of all with nature such as</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.100" end="00:19:04.110" style="s2">lightning later ones are codified qua</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.440" end="00:19:08.820" style="s2">punishment so this is part of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.110" end="00:19:11.730" style="s2">critique of there&#39;s a critique of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.820" end="00:19:14.880" style="s2">formalism of Legal Society in Epicurus</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.730" end="00:19:16.320" style="s2">view because if you think like you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.880" end="00:19:18.690" style="s2">if you think that the goal should be to</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.320" end="00:19:23.610" style="s2">facilitate pleasure right because of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.690" end="00:19:25.140" style="s2">material composition of the soul you you</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.610" end="00:19:27.330" style="s2">know you can see how a lot of laws might</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.140" end="00:19:28.830" style="s2">obstruct them right like to give you a</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.330" end="00:19:30.480" style="s2">very very cursory example like in our</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.830" end="00:19:34.470" style="s2">society we have rules against the</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.480" end="00:19:36.690" style="s2">consumption of you know certain forms of</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.470" end="00:19:38.430" style="s2">drugs right now</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.690" end="00:19:39.900" style="s2">not that Epicureans would have had a</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.430" end="00:19:40.130" style="s2">totally positive view of that because it</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.900" end="00:19:43.220" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.130" end="00:19:45.410" style="s2">military&#39;s physical consequences but you</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.220" end="00:19:46.880" style="s2">know I don&#39;t think anyone suffers too</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.410" end="00:19:49.730" style="s2">much for smoking a bit a bit of Jake</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.880" end="00:19:51.470" style="s2">right so you see the way that there can</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.730" end="00:19:53.330" style="s2">be a tension between law and pleasure in</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.470" end="00:19:56.500" style="s2">this way and then there&#39;s this view that</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.330" end="00:19:58.970" style="s2">which is very interesting as well that</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.500" end="00:20:00.980" style="s2">like early religious ideas kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.970" end="00:20:04.549" style="s2">expressed this again this sort of pure</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.980" end="00:20:07.039" style="s2">aw of natural phenomenon but that the</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.549" end="00:20:08.179" style="s2">gods are you know religion becomes quota</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.039" end="00:20:11.690" style="s2">fought codified in relation of</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.179" end="00:20:14.510" style="s2">punishment to support the punitive</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.690" end="00:20:16.100" style="s2">character of the state eventually so</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.510" end="00:20:17.630" style="s2">again quite a Marxist very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.100" end="00:20:21.080" style="s2">quite a Marxist dimension to that right</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.630" end="00:20:22.700" style="s2">in terms of base and superstructure this</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.080" end="00:20:25.159" style="s2">idea that the gods have to become these</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.700" end="00:20:29.059" style="s2">moralistic figures or punitive figures</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.159" end="00:20:32.659" style="s2">in order to you know morally justify the</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.059" end="00:20:34.340" style="s2">actions of the state for Epicurus just</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.659" end="00:20:35.809" style="s2">laws or those that can be justified in</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.340" end="00:20:37.190" style="s2">ur contractually as a means of promoting</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.809" end="00:20:38.929" style="s2">happiness</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.190" end="00:20:40.309" style="s2">whereas on unjust laws or those that</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.929" end="00:20:43.010" style="s2">obstruct it so again very interesting</p>

<p begin="00:20:43.010" end="00:20:48.559" style="s2">theory we see here right still he</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.270" end="00:20:49.909" style="s2">doesn&#39;t see breaking laws though is</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.559" end="00:20:53.539" style="s2">necessary even if those laws are</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.909" end="00:20:56.659" style="s2">irrational because of one the limited</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.539" end="00:20:58.610" style="s2">nature of our desires and to its</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.659" end="00:21:02.539" style="s2">inconvenience right so go back going</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.610" end="00:21:04.820" style="s2">back to you know natural needs right as</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.539" end="00:21:05.960" style="s2">opposed to unnatural needs he didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.820" end="00:21:07.220" style="s2">think all the laws were good but he</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.960" end="00:21:08.809" style="s2">thought like no matter what the laws are</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.220" end="00:21:11.299" style="s2">you should be able to meet your basic</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.809" end="00:21:13.100" style="s2">needs which is the important thing and</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.299" end="00:21:15.320" style="s2">also the problem is if you break laws</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.100" end="00:21:16.820" style="s2">you potentially be punished which can</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.320" end="00:21:20.210" style="s2">increase your pain and reduce your</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.820" end="00:21:21.740" style="s2">pleasure and Epicurus placed a high</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.210" end="00:21:26.950" style="s2">value also on friendship or love</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.740" end="00:21:32.210" style="s2">philia which he describes as a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.950" end="00:21:33.320" style="s2">utilitarian relation in the way that you</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.210" end="00:21:35.440" style="s2">know you become friends with people</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.320" end="00:21:37.940" style="s2">because you seek the pleasure of</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.440" end="00:21:39.350" style="s2">friendship but then it&#39;s one for him</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.940" end="00:21:42.260" style="s2">that acquires a certain kind of value</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.350" end="00:21:44.220" style="s2">and of itself right and there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.260" end="00:21:47.159" style="s2">some ambiguity</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.220" end="00:21:51.770" style="s2">okay so on to on to on to modern society</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.159" end="00:21:51.770" style="s2">here we go wait</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.890" end="00:21:59.070" style="s2">okay so Peterson and stoicism the fun</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.360" end="00:22:00.570" style="s2">part right there have been a spate of</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.070" end="00:22:02.159" style="s2">recent articles and blog posts which</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.570" end="00:22:03.360" style="s2">have sought to answer the question of to</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.159" end="00:22:05.870" style="s2">what degree the thought of Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.360" end="00:22:08.190" style="s2">Peterson reflects his stoic gimble&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.870" end="00:22:14.010" style="s2">well any comparison will invariably be</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.190" end="00:22:16.909" style="s2">approximate we we endeavor here to</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.010" end="00:22:19.799" style="s2">juxtapose his work with stoic ideas</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.909" end="00:22:21.419" style="s2">while the logos for the Stoics pervades</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.799" end="00:22:22.980" style="s2">and shapes the world for Peterson is</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.419" end="00:22:24.720" style="s2">largely psychologize so remember you</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.980" end="00:22:27.090" style="s2">have the pneuma for the logos which is</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.720" end="00:22:29.220" style="s2">coming in shaping inanimate matter for</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.090" end="00:22:30.630" style="s2">the Stoics um for Peterson Peterson the</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.220" end="00:22:31.950" style="s2">logo is actually some for Peterson the</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.630" end="00:22:35.700" style="s2">lowest the logos is actually something</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.950" end="00:22:38.510" style="s2">psychological right and the logos</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.700" end="00:22:42.570" style="s2">reflects from the search for truth right</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.510" end="00:22:44.250" style="s2">and it&#39;s it mediates between the two</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.570" end="00:22:45.510" style="s2">meta archetypes of order which is</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.250" end="00:22:48.059" style="s2">associated with the left side of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.510" end="00:22:49.260" style="s2">brain and the masculine and chaos which</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.059" end="00:22:53.100" style="s2">is associated with the right side of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.260" end="00:22:55.020" style="s2">brain and the feminine for Peterson then</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.100" end="00:22:57.419" style="s2">the logos is a largely subjective agency</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.020" end="00:22:59.880" style="s2">and he credits Christianity in</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.419" end="00:23:04.049" style="s2">particular with announcing its</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.880" end="00:23:07.289" style="s2">subjective designation right so you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.049" end="00:23:10.429" style="s2">Jesus Christ as announcing the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.289" end="00:23:12.480" style="s2">of humans to improve their circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.429" end="00:23:15.539" style="s2">within the structure of their own world</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.480" end="00:23:17.940" style="s2">to form a cultic community you know kind</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.539" end="00:23:22.110" style="s2">of subjective Isis right the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.940" end="00:23:23.370" style="s2">the logos in a way but what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.110" end="00:23:25.350" style="s2">interesting to note is that like the</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.370" end="00:23:27.270" style="s2">generative logos of the Stoics for</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.350" end="00:23:29.990" style="s2">Peterson the psychological logos is the</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.270" end="00:23:33.210" style="s2">privilege means through which extrinsic</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.990" end="00:23:36.059" style="s2">material processes are structured and</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.210" end="00:23:38.100" style="s2">interpreted so again material like the</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.059" end="00:23:39.770" style="s2">structure of the world for the Stoics it</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.100" end="00:23:43.409" style="s2">comes from the logos as a generative</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.770" end="00:23:47.250" style="s2">numa or logos that structures matter for</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.409" end="00:23:49.559" style="s2">Peterson like you know he says I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.250" end="00:23:52.049" style="s2">at one point like um what what what</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.559" end="00:23:54.690" style="s2">matters isn&#39;t matter it&#39;s what matter or</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.049" end="00:23:56.250" style="s2">what matters he said the our world isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.690" end="00:23:56.820" style="s2">based on matter it&#39;s based on what</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.250" end="00:23:57.809" style="s2">matters</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.820" end="00:24:00.509" style="s2">that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.809" end="00:24:03.210" style="s2">right so you see here for Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.509" end="00:24:06.389" style="s2">materiality is always secondary right</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.210" end="00:24:09.239" style="s2">he&#39;s you know in a certain way and we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.389" end="00:24:12.029" style="s2">see he&#39;s anti materialist because for</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.239" end="00:24:14.840" style="s2">him you know you always have a</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.029" end="00:24:16.619" style="s2">subjective agent who has to interpret</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.840" end="00:24:20.719" style="s2">material structures and give them</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.619" end="00:24:20.719" style="s2">meaning right that&#39;s very important</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.479" end="00:24:28.049" style="s2">unlike unions like James Hillman</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.039" end="00:24:31.049" style="s2">Peterson tends to portray the struggle</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.049" end="00:24:32.489" style="s2">of subjectivity or the logos as one</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.049" end="00:24:33.419" style="s2">through which chaos is tamed by the</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.489" end="00:24:35.339" style="s2">forces of order</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.419" end="00:24:38.369" style="s2">um so Peterson&#39;s a bit unique in this</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.339" end="00:24:39.899" style="s2">right like um I mean there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.369" end="00:24:44.089" style="s2">debates and there was a recent one that</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.899" end="00:24:48.599" style="s2">was going on between mount McManus and I</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.089" end="00:24:50.549" style="s2">and a guy involved in psychoanalytic</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.599" end="00:24:53.999" style="s2">practice and study whose name I forget</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.549" end="00:24:56.960" style="s2">it took place on Marion West but he was</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.999" end="00:24:59.399" style="s2">saying that there&#39;s a lot of unions who</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.960" end="00:25:02.070" style="s2">dislike Peterson because they find he</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.399" end="00:25:04.940" style="s2">stresses too much the role of order</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.070" end="00:25:07.349" style="s2">right whereas for you it&#39;s a more</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.940" end="00:25:09.059" style="s2">complex relationship between the two</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.349" end="00:25:12.389" style="s2">not that Peterson doesn&#39;t have elements</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.059" end="00:25:18.389" style="s2">of complexity but I think what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.389" end="00:25:21.029" style="s2">name of this it&#39;s 12 rules for life an</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.389" end="00:25:22.229" style="s2">antidote for chaos right so again you</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.029" end="00:25:24.389" style="s2">know even in that kind of presentation</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.229" end="00:25:26.070" style="s2">um chaos is treated like something that</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.389" end="00:25:28.019" style="s2">has to be combatted like the principal</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.070" end="00:25:31.559" style="s2">antagonist I mean a lot of unions do not</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.019" end="00:25:33.029" style="s2">see it that way this assignation of</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.559" end="00:25:36.119" style="s2">priority to order permit certain</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.029" end="00:25:37.649" style="s2">comparisons with stoicism Peterson like</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.119" end="00:25:39.739" style="s2">the Stoics believes that one must live</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.649" end="00:25:41.820" style="s2">in accord with nature in a certain sense</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.739" end="00:25:43.859" style="s2">something seen by his first chapter of</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.820" end="00:25:46.200" style="s2">12 us for life in which he naturalizes</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.859" end="00:25:48.450" style="s2">inequality by claiming for instance the</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.200" end="00:25:50.639" style="s2">Pareto principle structures it so in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.450" end="00:25:53.249" style="s2">in the first chapter and we discussed</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.639" end="00:25:55.320" style="s2">this a lot like at the last event in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.249" end="00:25:56.460" style="s2">first chapter 4 of 12 rules for life</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.320" end="00:25:57.679" style="s2">stand up straight with your shoulders</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.460" end="00:26:02.879" style="s2">back</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.679" end="00:26:10.080" style="s2">Peterson puts forth a model of nature he</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.879" end="00:26:11.610" style="s2">posits in which essentially nature is</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.080" end="00:26:15.210" style="s2">inherently in Equus</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.610" end="00:26:16.620" style="s2">right you know so he talks about you</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.210" end="00:26:18.060" style="s2">know prices law and the brett-o</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.620" end="00:26:19.740" style="s2">principle and how this applies to nature</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.060" end="00:26:21.120" style="s2">he talks about that the natural</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.740" end="00:26:23.190" style="s2">character of differential production</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.120" end="00:26:24.720" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.190" end="00:26:26.760" style="s2">and for Peterson of course if you</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.720" end="00:26:29.220" style="s2">transgress this right if you try to</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.760" end="00:26:32.520" style="s2">achieve equal outcome right whatever</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.220" end="00:26:34.500" style="s2">that means you you know the great risk</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.520" end="00:26:37.440" style="s2">is that you create totalitarianism so we</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.500" end="00:26:39.630" style="s2">have to try to address certain forms of</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.440" end="00:26:43.010" style="s2">systemic and wealth inequality but for</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.630" end="00:26:45.480" style="s2">Peterson we have to do so in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.010" end="00:26:48.030" style="s2">comprehends and represents the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.480" end="00:26:54.900" style="s2">individuals and more of our nature are</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.030" end="00:26:56.130" style="s2">differentially productive and here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.900" end="00:26:57.540" style="s2">big but but here&#39;s a big difference</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.130" end="00:27:00.420" style="s2">right between Peterson and stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.540" end="00:27:03.480" style="s2">again for Peterson nature is not</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.420" end="00:27:05.130" style="s2">rational right fundamentally which means</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.480" end="00:27:06.480" style="s2">that the role the logos is to order it</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.130" end="00:27:08.850" style="s2">without running afoul of its fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.480" end="00:27:10.200" style="s2">ontology so again the logos is</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.850" end="00:27:15.080" style="s2">subjective for Peterson it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.200" end="00:27:19.470" style="s2">situated at the at the objective level</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.080" end="00:27:23.190" style="s2">so what so in this way you know Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.470" end="00:27:25.170" style="s2">is is less rationalist then than the</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.190" end="00:27:26.730" style="s2">Stoics because the Stoics perceive a</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.170" end="00:27:28.530" style="s2">fundamental harmony or order to the</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.730" end="00:27:30.240" style="s2">structure of nature whereas for Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.530" end="00:27:33.660" style="s2">nature is cruel you know it&#39;s like like</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.240" end="00:27:36.950" style="s2">Hobbes kind of nature it&#39;s it&#39;s you know</p>

<p begin="00:27:54.660" end="00:27:59.490" style="s2">because that would be very risky so</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.870" end="00:28:01.050" style="s2">again should one insist on going too far</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.490" end="00:28:03.510" style="s2">and ordering reality the invariable</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.050" end="00:28:05.160" style="s2">result would be to Talat arianism and</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.510" end="00:28:08.130" style="s2">I&#39;ll add that while Peterson is not a</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.160" end="00:28:11.010" style="s2">logician this also leads him to an</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.130" end="00:28:13.710" style="s2">embrace of the need for logic which he</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.010" end="00:28:16.320" style="s2">accuses the postmodernists of having</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.710" end="00:28:17.760" style="s2">abandoned right and so you see the term</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.320" end="00:28:19.440" style="s2">fellow go centrism here which is</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.760" end="00:28:24.030" style="s2">associated with Jacques Derrida the</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.440" end="00:28:25.380" style="s2">French philosopher the idea that the</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.030" end="00:28:27.360" style="s2">idea that our</p>

<p begin="00:28:39.030" end="00:28:43.110" style="s2">that&#39;s quite that&#39;s actually quite</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.140" end="00:28:45.500" style="s2">complicated how that how logic works</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.110" end="00:28:47.820" style="s2">within Pederson but I think his his</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.500" end="00:28:51.060" style="s2">position would be that we need to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.820" end="00:28:54.350" style="s2">logical because we&#39;re not logical we are</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.060" end="00:28:57.810" style="s2">not going to be able to acknowledge or</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.350" end="00:29:00.720" style="s2">or represent the objective structure of</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.810" end="00:29:02.070" style="s2">nature which is radically unequal and</p>

<p begin="00:29:02.070" end="00:29:11.300" style="s2">systems and means of adopting to it okay</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.450" end="00:29:16.230" style="s2">so now we move on to Marx and Epicurus</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.300" end="00:29:18.800" style="s2">right now this is a little actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.230" end="00:29:23.250" style="s2">easier right then then Peterson and</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.800" end="00:29:25.440" style="s2">stoicism Marx&#39;s doctoral thesis the</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.250" end="00:29:26.840" style="s2">difference between the democraty and an</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.440" end="00:29:28.500" style="s2">epicurean philosophy of nature</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.840" end="00:29:29.820" style="s2">investigated the ways in which the</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.500" end="00:29:34.200" style="s2">thought of Epicurus differed from that</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.820" end="00:29:36.900" style="s2">of Democritus so again we have a direct</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.200" end="00:29:39.440" style="s2">connection in Marx&#39;s intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.900" end="00:29:42.300" style="s2">history to epicurean thought in</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.440" end="00:29:43.560" style="s2">particular Marx remarkably considering</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.300" end="00:29:45.450" style="s2">the textual basis if you worked on</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.560" end="00:29:47.640" style="s2">stresses the importance of the swerve</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.450" end="00:29:50.850" style="s2">for Epicurus or the way the atoms do not</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.640" end="00:29:52.650" style="s2">follow pre structured patterns so Marx</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.850" end="00:29:54.090" style="s2">you know actually traditionally people</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.650" end="00:29:55.830" style="s2">said we&#39;ll have the Cure as Democritus</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.090" end="00:29:58.200" style="s2">same thing Marx is one of the first</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.830" end="00:29:59.910" style="s2">people to really say no what Epicurus is</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.200" end="00:30:01.620" style="s2">doing is quite fundamentally different</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.910" end="00:30:04.530" style="s2">than what Democritus is doing because of</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.620" end="00:30:06.860" style="s2">the allowance of personal freedom we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.530" end="00:30:09.000" style="s2">not just personal freedom but I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.860" end="00:30:12.300" style="s2">allowance of contingency in the universe</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.000" end="00:30:13.710" style="s2">right and this is actually pretty</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.300" end="00:30:15.360" style="s2">amazing when you considered the sources</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.710" end="00:30:19.350" style="s2">he was working off because as we find</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.360" end="00:30:21.420" style="s2">more tax and and understand better the</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.350" end="00:30:23.940" style="s2">relationship of Democritus and Epicurus</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.420" end="00:30:25.830" style="s2">a lot of what we discovered conforms to</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.940" end="00:30:29.670" style="s2">what Marx sort of speculatively</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.830" end="00:30:31.350" style="s2">demonstrated already and this question I</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.670" end="00:30:33.900" style="s2">think for Marx was largely a question of</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.350" end="00:30:35.040" style="s2">how to do philosophy post system because</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.900" end="00:30:37.490" style="s2">Mark said directly with the work of</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.040" end="00:30:39.299" style="s2">haggle so of course where Marx was</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.490" end="00:30:41.879" style="s2">developing philosophically the</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.299" end="00:30:44.850" style="s2">Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel was very</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.879" end="00:30:46.499" style="s2">very dominant in German context and such</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.850" end="00:30:52.139" style="s2">was the complexity and depth of haggle</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.499" end="00:30:53.399" style="s2">system that in a way it the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.139" end="00:30:55.289" style="s2">it was it swallowed up everything else</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.399" end="00:30:58.350" style="s2">because for Hegel you don&#39;t just have</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.289" end="00:30:59.700" style="s2">the truth the truth is the negativity</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.350" end="00:31:02.700" style="s2">through you which through which you</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.700" end="00:31:06.210" style="s2">progress to the truth right</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.700" end="00:31:09.389" style="s2">you know and it&#39;s changing so he says</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.210" end="00:31:10.710" style="s2">like look at the time right it&#39;s seven</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.389" end="00:31:12.269" style="s2">forty four and one minute it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.710" end="00:31:14.460" style="s2">be seven forty five so how do you</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.269" end="00:31:15.899" style="s2">overcome the philosophy that has</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.460" end="00:31:17.700" style="s2">incorporated all philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.899" end="00:31:19.950" style="s2">dissidents our own electoral dissidents</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.700" end="00:31:21.720" style="s2">into itself in advance and I think he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.950" end="00:31:26.419" style="s2">really struggling with this question you</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.720" end="00:31:26.419" style="s2">know when he when he talks about how</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.629" end="00:31:35.399" style="s2">Epicurus broke with Democritus so to try</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.899" end="00:31:39.149" style="s2">to break with haggle Marx latched on to</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.399" end="00:31:41.309" style="s2">the work of for back and for back argued</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.149" end="00:31:43.889" style="s2">that haggles dialectic is interpreted as</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.309" end="00:31:46.789" style="s2">having its true basis in biology so that</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.889" end="00:31:50.179" style="s2">for example the dialectic of religion</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.789" end="00:31:54.029" style="s2">reflects the spiritual impulse</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.179" end="00:31:56.970" style="s2">pre-existent in all humans right so we</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.029" end="00:31:59.159" style="s2">codify for our backs idea was that we</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.970" end="00:32:01.710" style="s2">codify for example religious</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.159" end="00:32:04.080" style="s2">institutions we create all these moral</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.710" end="00:32:05.970" style="s2">rules you know this is what God says but</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.080" end="00:32:10.409" style="s2">for for for back the truth of of</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.970" end="00:32:14.549" style="s2">religion you know is the need of human</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.409" end="00:32:17.999" style="s2">beings on a biological basis for you</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.549" end="00:32:21.539" style="s2">know solidarity community a certain form</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.999" end="00:32:23.489" style="s2">of spiritual participation right but of</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.539" end="00:32:25.379" style="s2">course you know this was quite</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.489" end="00:32:28.139" style="s2">fashionable on the left in Germany at</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.379" end="00:32:29.369" style="s2">that time because if you accept for</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.139" end="00:32:30.989" style="s2">backs thesis then you don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.369" end="00:32:32.999" style="s2">formally organized religion anymore</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.989" end="00:32:37.100" style="s2">because the truth of religion in a way</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.999" end="00:32:37.100" style="s2">becomes these very general moral ideas</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.640" end="00:32:44.900" style="s2">so by secularizing haggles idea and</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.010" end="00:32:47.060" style="s2">attempting to make the dialectic pivot</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.900" end="00:32:48.770" style="s2">on material particularity marks the</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.060" end="00:32:50.480" style="s2">juices in askesis or practice through</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.770" end="00:32:52.640" style="s2">which capitalism must be overthrown in</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.480" end="00:32:53.720" style="s2">order to abolish alienation from man&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.640" end="00:32:56.630" style="s2">nature to be realized</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.720" end="00:32:59.300" style="s2">so let me unpack that a little bit so I</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.630" end="00:33:04.460" style="s2">talked before about how haggles</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.300" end="00:33:06.260" style="s2">dialectic 4/4 back reflects certain</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.460" end="00:33:08.630" style="s2">natural impulses that we have as humans</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.260" end="00:33:11.620" style="s2">right and moreover social institutions</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.630" end="00:33:14.210" style="s2">like religion which are part of this and</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.620" end="00:33:16.130" style="s2">Marx agrees with this but what he</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.210" end="00:33:18.320" style="s2">observes is that religion isn&#39;t the main</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.130" end="00:33:22.100" style="s2">problem anymore the problem is that our</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.320" end="00:33:27.920" style="s2">natural human needs are being obstructed</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.100" end="00:33:29.360" style="s2">by capitalism right so again the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.920" end="00:33:30.920" style="s2">idea of alienation right like you</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.360" end="00:33:32.660" style="s2">produce something it&#39;s the object of</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.920" end="00:33:35.480" style="s2">your labor you&#39;re intimately connected</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.660" end="00:33:36.920" style="s2">to the production process but on your</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.480" end="00:33:38.630" style="s2">capitalism you&#39;re producing things you</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.920" end="00:33:42.680" style="s2">don&#39;t want to produce for other people</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.630" end="00:33:44.900" style="s2">right you know which you know engenders</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.680" end="00:33:49.490" style="s2">this this this frustration or give</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.900" end="00:33:52.490" style="s2">munition of the of the subject but in a</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.490" end="00:33:56.420" style="s2">way this this attempt to read Hegel sort</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.490" end="00:33:59.360" style="s2">of biologically by for back it fails and</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.420" end="00:34:05.900" style="s2">this is shown by Max Turner who in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.360" end="00:34:07.580" style="s2">1840s he he basically says that that all</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.900" end="00:34:10.610" style="s2">the the socialists like Marx have really</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.580" end="00:34:12.770" style="s2">done is they&#39;ve just naturalized the</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.610" end="00:34:14.120" style="s2">religious notion of man or the human so</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.770" end="00:34:15.919" style="s2">store nurse critique was that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.120" end="00:34:18.710" style="s2">basically continuing with religious</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.919" end="00:34:22.070" style="s2">ideas but they&#39;re just putting a new</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.710" end="00:34:24.790" style="s2">label on them right so conscious of this</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.070" end="00:34:26.960" style="s2">Marx alters a system in the mid 1840s</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.790" end="00:34:29.570" style="s2">and he starts to try to think about</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.960" end="00:34:31.340" style="s2">rather than thinking about humans is</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.570" end="00:34:34.340" style="s2">having pre-given deep biological needs</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.340" end="00:34:37.100" style="s2">and his dialectic reflecting that mark</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.340" end="00:34:39.139" style="s2">starts to think about is it possible</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.100" end="00:34:40.520" style="s2">that even the idea of the human or the</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.139" end="00:34:44.510" style="s2">character of the human is conditioned by</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.520" end="00:34:47.419" style="s2">economic history so he shifts his system</p>

<p begin="00:34:47.419" end="00:34:53.540" style="s2">like value you know relations of</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.240" end="00:34:55.040" style="s2">production means of production and so on</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.540" end="00:35:01.090" style="s2">rather than starting with a biological</p>

<p begin="00:35:01.090" end="00:35:06.020" style="s2">because of this dislocation between</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.710" end="00:35:09.160" style="s2">Marx&#39;s early humanist and biological</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.020" end="00:35:11.630" style="s2">work and his late sort of economic work</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.160" end="00:35:14.900" style="s2">waiter Marxist thinkers tended to read</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.630" end="00:35:19.870" style="s2">Marx broadly is either humanist or</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.900" end="00:35:23.630" style="s2">materialist so Michele uhnari a French</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.870" end="00:35:24.290" style="s2">Marxist thinker he explains that Marx&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:35:24.290" end="00:35:27.350" style="s2">he explains Marx&#39;s later works by</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.640" end="00:35:29.300" style="s2">appealing to his early humanist writings</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.350" end="00:35:32.420" style="s2">where as Lewis South is they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.300" end="00:35:34.640" style="s2">materialist very scientific rejects</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.420" end="00:35:38.000" style="s2">these is immature because he claims</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.640" end="00:35:40.100" style="s2">they&#39;re still too ideological and I want</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.000" end="00:35:42.200" style="s2">to just add that altas are in materials</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.100" end="00:35:46.610" style="s2">in the encounter connects Marx&#39;s suppose</p>

<p begin="00:35:50.540" end="00:35:57.140" style="s2">so for alphas are to be Marx had to get</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.710" end="00:35:59.000" style="s2">rid of the notion of this humanist or or</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.140" end="00:36:01.130" style="s2">biological notion of the human being the</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.000" end="00:36:06.050" style="s2">basis of a system in order to fully</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.130" end="00:36:09.230" style="s2">realize the materialism that was already</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.050" end="00:36:15.440" style="s2">latent in for example the democraty in</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.230" end="00:36:17.180" style="s2">or epicurean traditions so here we go so</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.440" end="00:36:19.190" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s problem here&#39;s here we go</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.180" end="00:36:21.350" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s problem um</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.190" end="00:36:23.540" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s philosophy is in part popular</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.350" end="00:36:24.860" style="s2">because it offers advice directly to</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.540" end="00:36:27.170" style="s2">individuals as to how they should live</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.860" end="00:36:30.770" style="s2">their lives and this occurs in common</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.170" end="00:36:33.140" style="s2">mysticism to do this Peterson appeals to</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.770" end="00:36:34.940" style="s2">certain normative structures in here in</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.140" end="00:36:37.760" style="s2">nature right we see that with the the</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.940" end="00:36:39.470" style="s2">Stoics as well the notion of nature is</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.760" end="00:36:42.410" style="s2">pervaded by rationality however as</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.470" end="00:36:44.090" style="s2">embodying the logos was far more tenable</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.410" end="00:36:45.710" style="s2">philosophically prior to the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.090" end="00:36:48.440" style="s2">developments associated in modernity</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.710" end="00:36:51.460" style="s2">so again when the Stoics were were</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.440" end="00:36:53.900" style="s2">writing they all they could engage in in</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.460" end="00:36:56.660" style="s2">broad speculation about how nature</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.900" end="00:36:58.880" style="s2">functioned you know nature is structured</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.660" end="00:37:02.870" style="s2">rationally and so on so on you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.880" end="00:37:05.630" style="s2">modern science really poses a challenge</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.870" end="00:37:06.349" style="s2">right to that kind of generalization of</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.630" end="00:37:08.449" style="s2">nature</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.349" end="00:37:10.549" style="s2">um so of course you know anyone who</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.449" end="00:37:13.039" style="s2">knows philosophy we know well Immanuel</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.549" end="00:37:15.319" style="s2">Kant right kind of signals the shift</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.039" end="00:37:17.359" style="s2">where you have you can&#39;t just go out and</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.319" end="00:37:18.949" style="s2">you know make these kind of metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.359" end="00:37:23.689" style="s2">suppositions you have to ask the</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.949" end="00:37:25.609" style="s2">question of you know how those sub</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.689" end="00:37:27.349" style="s2">positions relate to the subject who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.609" end="00:37:29.509" style="s2">putting them forth right</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.349" end="00:37:30.829" style="s2">so again Peterson this is where Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.509" end="00:37:34.519" style="s2">you know he&#39;s a product of modern</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.829" end="00:37:38.179" style="s2">philosophy so it&#39;s a far more subjective</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.519" end="00:37:41.689" style="s2">formulation of that Peterson attempts to</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.179" end="00:37:47.599" style="s2">overcome this problem you know that the</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.689" end="00:37:50.539" style="s2">like the fact of having to the fact of</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.599" end="00:37:52.339" style="s2">of the on attained on attainability of a</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.539" end="00:37:53.900" style="s2">full knowledge of nature by one</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.339" end="00:37:56.299" style="s2">positioning consciousness is something</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.900" end="00:37:58.819" style="s2">that must represent without directly</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.299" end="00:38:02.089" style="s2">reprising in egalitarian natural</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.819" end="00:38:04.069" style="s2">structures and to buttressing his at</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.089" end="00:38:07.400" style="s2">ARCIC image of nature with evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.069" end="00:38:10.099" style="s2">biological researches so again to try to</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.400" end="00:38:11.569" style="s2">you know Peterson on one hand stresses</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.099" end="00:38:16.039" style="s2">the distance between the subjective</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.569" end="00:38:18.409" style="s2">logos and the structure of nature and -</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.039" end="00:38:20.599" style="s2">he tries to defend his vision of nature</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.409" end="00:38:21.979" style="s2">by supporting it with things like you</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.599" end="00:38:24.979" style="s2">know research and evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.979" end="00:38:29.319" style="s2">psychology but this is like a fairly</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.979" end="00:38:33.439" style="s2">fragile edifice actually right so um</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.319" end="00:38:34.999" style="s2">Peterson will say you know and this is</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.439" end="00:38:38.419" style="s2">very dubious you know in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.999" end="00:38:40.969" style="s2">studies he uses but Peters animal states</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.419" end="00:38:43.819" style="s2">say the fact women pursue STEM fields</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.969" end="00:38:47.679" style="s2">lessen gender equal countries like</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.819" end="00:38:51.109" style="s2">Sweden proves that women are</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.679" end="00:38:53.179" style="s2">biologically right less interested in in</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.109" end="00:38:54.919" style="s2">STEM disciplines right but this only</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.179" end="00:38:57.199" style="s2">really works if you accept like a very</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.919" end="00:38:58.579" style="s2">very tenuous idea of these evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.199" end="00:39:00.049" style="s2">archetypal structures I mean not many</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.579" end="00:39:03.349" style="s2">women did stem 50 years ago and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.049" end="00:39:05.839" style="s2">a lot now so you see the way Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.349" end="00:39:10.059" style="s2">has to you know it&#39;s quite hard to</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.839" end="00:39:12.319" style="s2">defend sometimes how he uses that and</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.059" end="00:39:15.380" style="s2">ultimately Peterson purchases his</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.319" end="00:39:16.640" style="s2">thoughts utility to individuals by</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.380" end="00:39:18.769" style="s2">paying the cost of its philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.640" end="00:39:19.970" style="s2">coherency so again</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.769" end="00:39:24.680" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s able to</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.970" end="00:39:29.920" style="s2">you Petersons able to you know issue</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.680" end="00:39:35.210" style="s2">this this hard advice that that is</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.920" end="00:39:39.730" style="s2">connected to nature because he draws too</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.210" end="00:39:43.760" style="s2">far to direct a link right between</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.730" end="00:39:45.740" style="s2">nature and you know structures of</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.760" end="00:39:47.840" style="s2">behavior individual structures right</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.740" end="00:39:49.490" style="s2">like I said about you know okay well</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.840" end="00:39:51.830" style="s2">women naturally or interests in stem and</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.490" end="00:39:53.330" style="s2">this kind of thing so there&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.830" end="00:39:54.320" style="s2">loss of philosophical here and see that</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.330" end="00:39:55.940" style="s2">that happens in that way</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.320" end="00:39:58.130" style="s2">so again Peterson has you know he&#39;s able</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.940" end="00:40:01.340" style="s2">to you to - not that he directly says</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.130" end="00:40:02.900" style="s2">copy nature but he&#39;s able to use to</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.340" end="00:40:09.109" style="s2">claim that natural structures can offer</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.900" end="00:40:11.599" style="s2">us instruction only by you know more</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.109" end="00:40:18.380" style="s2">directly connecting them than you really</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.599" end="00:40:20.300" style="s2">should to the way we behave right so</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.380" end="00:40:23.750" style="s2">here we go now we get into Marx&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.300" end="00:40:26.270" style="s2">problem and solution like Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.750" end="00:40:28.640" style="s2">Marx&#39;s early work justifies its appeal</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.270" end="00:40:31.369" style="s2">to individual praxis on the basis of</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.640" end="00:40:33.530" style="s2">biology specifically for box biology</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.369" end="00:40:35.210" style="s2">biology ization of haggle so again in</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.530" end="00:40:39.230" style="s2">the early Marxist work like Peterson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.210" end="00:40:41.859" style="s2">work it used conceptions of biology</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.230" end="00:40:44.060" style="s2">nature to justify the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.859" end="00:40:47.810" style="s2">anti-capitalist in this case praxis that</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.060" end="00:40:50.599" style="s2">one should engage in but unlike Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.810" end="00:40:51.950" style="s2">Marx relinquished this agenda because he</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.599" end="00:40:55.490" style="s2">recognized that it was intellectually</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.950" end="00:40:58.580" style="s2">untenable but we still see that in</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.490" end="00:41:02.810" style="s2">capital Marx&#39;s mature economic work that</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.580" end="00:41:04.910" style="s2">biology and subjectivity play a role for</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.810" end="00:41:06.140" style="s2">Hegel truth is temporal but still exists</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.910" end="00:41:08.630" style="s2">I think I said this for haggled the</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.140" end="00:41:11.869" style="s2">truth could be you know at 7:44 and the</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.630" end="00:41:15.440" style="s2">next minute it&#39;s 7:45 right and so</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.869" end="00:41:17.570" style="s2">rationality for Hegel is changing and it</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.440" end="00:41:20.330" style="s2">has to be brought into the world by</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.570" end="00:41:23.390" style="s2">different individuals or classes so know</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.330" end="00:41:26.109" style="s2">so for example a haggle views Napoleon</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.390" end="00:41:30.800" style="s2">the world spirit on horseback as a</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.109" end="00:41:32.810" style="s2">manifest agent of rationalization right</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.800" end="00:41:33.650" style="s2">he talks about state bureaucrats playing</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.810" end="00:41:35.210" style="s2">this role</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.650" end="00:41:36.710" style="s2">the philosophy of right so it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.210" end="00:41:39.520" style="s2">philosophy in the abstract right</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.710" end="00:41:44.029" style="s2">philosophy actually has to be you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.520" end="00:41:46.220" style="s2">manifested in reality and borrowing this</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.029" end="00:41:48.230" style="s2">from from this model Marx posits the</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.220" end="00:41:50.359" style="s2">proletariat as the universal class in</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.230" end="00:41:52.869" style="s2">capital whereas it succeeds the</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.359" end="00:41:56.569" style="s2">bourgeois in this respect um so again</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.869" end="00:41:58.279" style="s2">for Marx there&#39;s nothing absolute or</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.569" end="00:42:00.440" style="s2">biological but the proletariat it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.279" end="00:42:02.000" style="s2">brought forth historically but the fact</p>

<p begin="00:45:14.630" end="00:45:17.750" style="s2">I should say about this is what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.250" end="00:45:21.050" style="s2">is that you can talk about these sort of</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.750" end="00:45:24.290" style="s2">norms of interaction um but like you</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.050" end="00:45:25.910" style="s2">know in a way I&#39;m and this is thinking</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.290" end="00:45:27.320" style="s2">about the analogy with Darwin right the</p>

<p begin="00:45:30.500" end="00:45:36.230" style="s2">problem is its I think it&#39;s very hard to</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.960" end="00:45:37.640" style="s2">get people whose opinions are so</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.230" end="00:45:40.190" style="s2">radically different about how the world</p>

<p begin="00:45:44.750" end="00:45:50.120" style="s2">very good proposals but again when I say</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.870" end="00:45:52.910" style="s2">over unified I mean I think in a way all</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.120" end="00:45:55.640" style="s2">this kind of presupposes that there are</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.910" end="00:45:57.200" style="s2">some kind of common basis right and I</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.640" end="00:45:58.640" style="s2">was talking about much of this lecture</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.200" end="00:46:01.160" style="s2">is about the risk of kind of fixing</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.640" end="00:46:02.570" style="s2">right a notion of the subject</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.160" end="00:46:04.010" style="s2">that there&#39;s a kind of totally common</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.570" end="00:46:07.930" style="s2">basis upon which people can relate to</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.010" end="00:46:09.980" style="s2">and I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s the case</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.930" end="00:46:11.210" style="s2">Bloomberg and Barnes acknowledged that</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.980" end="00:46:14.000" style="s2">the current crisis has a socio-economic</p>

<p begin="00:46:24.980" end="00:46:27.710" style="s2">term postmodern because he wrote a book</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.330" end="00:46:28.880" style="s2">that was commissioned by the Quebec</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.710" end="00:46:30.980" style="s2">government called the postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.880" end="00:46:34.070" style="s2">condition and in that he talks about how</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.980" end="00:46:35.480" style="s2">the difficulty of the huge amount of</p>

<p begin="00:46:44.000" end="00:46:47.810" style="s2">that there are these sort of Tidy</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.849" end="00:46:50.030" style="s2">large-scale narratives that can be used</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.810" end="00:46:51.109" style="s2">to structure history right so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.030" end="00:46:52.900" style="s2">constantly exposed to different</p>

<p begin="00:46:58.790" end="00:47:02.000" style="s2">post-modernism is right it&#39;s also an</p>

<p begin="00:47:07.190" end="00:47:11.000" style="s2">of the problem is socio-economic I think</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.530" end="00:47:12.950" style="s2">we have to say also that you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.000" end="00:47:15.530" style="s2">addressing this disunity will require a</p>

<p begin="00:47:15.530" end="00:47:18.970" style="s2">can propose certain strategies that may</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.970" end="00:47:22.970" style="s2">help but to really fix this problem</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.970" end="00:47:24.530" style="s2">there has to be a unification of our</p>

<p begin="00:47:24.530" end="00:47:30.260" style="s2">addresses this difficulty of aggregation</p>

<p begin="00:48:41.510" end="00:48:44.810" style="s2">that the question the more important</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.040" end="00:48:48.770" style="s2">question may not be how do we relate to</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.810" end="00:48:51.080" style="s2">each other on a good-faith basis it may</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.770" end="00:48:53.510" style="s2">be what is the perspective if we look at</p>

<p begin="00:48:53.510" end="00:48:58.640" style="s2">emerging is does one of them have a</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.640" end="00:49:01.790" style="s2">perspective that could actually achieve</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.640" end="00:49:04.040" style="s2">the unification of the polis right in</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.790" end="00:49:05.330" style="s2">other words that could through you know</p>

<p begin="00:49:45.980" end="00:49:53.660" style="s2">for Conrad or anything you you&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.540" end="00:49:55.520" style="s2">heard just right in the chat box and you</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.660" end="00:49:57.890" style="s2">know we&#39;ll start off with actually Jacob</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.520" end="00:50:00.290" style="s2">because Jacob said he didn&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.890" end="00:50:02.390" style="s2">question per se but the critique and</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.290" end="00:50:04.580" style="s2">that&#39;s okay too if someone kind of just</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.390" end="00:50:05.750" style="s2">provides a critique on what they hurt</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.580" end="00:50:11.390" style="s2">and then you could have a little back</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.750" end="00:50:16.460" style="s2">and forth on rent sorry so Jacob you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.390" end="00:50:21.160" style="s2">up so thanks Thank You Conrad for all</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.460" end="00:50:23.530" style="s2">that it&#39;s a lot there so just preface</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.160" end="00:50:26.349" style="s2">this it could be that you didn&#39;t mean to</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.530" end="00:50:28.059" style="s2">write it this way and that this is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.349" end="00:50:30.819" style="s2">not actually what you meant to say</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.059" end="00:50:33.069" style="s2">and so this critique is hinging upon</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.819" end="00:50:35.200" style="s2">something you wrote and I realize you</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.069" end="00:50:37.660" style="s2">might not even mean this and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.200" end="00:50:39.760" style="s2">open to it&#39;s not concrete right because</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.660" end="00:50:43.869" style="s2">I realize you just said something badly</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.760" end="00:50:46.750" style="s2">or something so I&#39;m kind of going</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.869" end="00:50:46.960" style="s2">through your neck here okay take it take</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.750" end="00:50:50.319" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.960" end="00:50:52.510" style="s2">uh I mean the possibilities I would make</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.319" end="00:50:54.190" style="s2">make make a mistake in the presentation</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.510" end="00:50:55.869" style="s2">of these subjects which I&#39;m not so</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.190" end="00:51:00.609" style="s2">familiar with is very much you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.869" end="00:51:03.309" style="s2">built in so I invite this right right so</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.609" end="00:51:06.220" style="s2">I I find it hard to take any of your</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.309" end="00:51:08.230" style="s2">arguments seriously let&#39;s say if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.220" end="00:51:11.140" style="s2">a general current of a misapprehension</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.230" end="00:51:13.299" style="s2">of Peterson&#39;s teachings since I saw it</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.140" end="00:51:14.829" style="s2">several of like man I think your</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.299" end="00:51:16.240" style="s2">profound me miss apprehending it so</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.829" end="00:51:19.329" style="s2">here&#39;s just one this is the one that</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.240" end="00:51:22.359" style="s2">maybe yes that badly as you said that</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.329" end="00:51:26.200" style="s2">George and Peterson doesn&#39;t work warns</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.359" end="00:51:28.839" style="s2">against too much ordering and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.200" end="00:51:31.210" style="s2">actually the opposite of that because</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.839" end="00:51:32.920" style="s2">you want infinite ordering because</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.210" end="00:51:34.150" style="s2">you&#39;re open to the chaos enough to where</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.920" end="00:51:35.619" style="s2">you&#39;re constantly engaged in the process</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.150" end="00:51:37.480" style="s2">of integrating information so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.619" end="00:51:38.920" style="s2">actually constantly ordering what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.480" end="00:51:40.270" style="s2">against is too much order which is the</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.920" end="00:51:42.490" style="s2">opposite which is where you build a wall</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.270" end="00:51:43.720" style="s2">and stop the process and just concern</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.490" end="00:51:46.569" style="s2">yourself with what you&#39;ve already mapped</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.720" end="00:51:47.950" style="s2">and so anyway that&#39;s just an example of</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.569" end="00:51:49.630" style="s2">where you&#39;ve got something perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.950" end="00:51:53.190" style="s2">backwards wrong and then it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.630" end="00:51:55.630" style="s2">how can I trust anything you say so</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.190" end="00:51:56.799" style="s2">there&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s not way just to</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.630" end="00:51:58.539" style="s2">say it with that that&#39;s not that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.799" end="00:51:59.799" style="s2">like you know of course like you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.539" end="00:52:01.480" style="s2">you can find these these particular</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.799" end="00:52:02.740" style="s2">phrases but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s so out</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.480" end="00:52:04.359" style="s2">of sync with what I was actually saying</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.740" end="00:52:06.250" style="s2">right because I was saying that he</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.359" end="00:52:07.690" style="s2">acknowledges you know so you refer to a</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.250" end="00:52:10.900" style="s2">distinction between order and ordering</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.690" end="00:52:12.819" style="s2">right and I mean the way you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.900" end="00:52:15.329" style="s2">describing ordering it&#39;s the achievement</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.819" end="00:52:18.599" style="s2">of a kind of mediation of chaos by order</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.329" end="00:52:22.000" style="s2">right if I understand you properly right</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.599" end="00:52:23.500" style="s2">sure well I wouldn&#39;t say actually no not</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.000" end="00:52:28.559" style="s2">at my ammunition of cast by order of</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.500" end="00:52:32.289" style="s2">mediation of chaos by the by the logos</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.559" end="00:52:34.119" style="s2">but but nevertheless go ahead okay okay</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.289" end="00:52:34.600" style="s2">well the logos is very involved in this</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.119" end="00:52:38.680" style="s2">mediation</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.600" end="00:52:40.630" style="s2">right that&#39;s that&#39;s um but but again I</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.680" end="00:52:42.490" style="s2">don&#39;t think that that you know III I</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.630" end="00:52:45.550" style="s2">very clearly acknowledge here you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.490" end="00:52:47.350" style="s2">in terms of the logos that you know in</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.550" end="00:52:48.610" style="s2">its characteristic of psychoanalysis in</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.350" end="00:52:53.290" style="s2">general and particularly Union</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.610" end="00:52:55.630" style="s2">psychoanalysis that however what however</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.290" end="00:52:57.790" style="s2">one much tilts in the direction of order</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.630" end="00:52:59.500" style="s2">and chaos in terms of their</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.790" end="00:53:01.510" style="s2">interpretation of Jung or psychoanalysis</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.500" end="00:53:04.540" style="s2">more generally that there&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.510" end="00:53:06.190" style="s2">an acknowledgement of the sort of Co</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.540" end="00:53:08.560" style="s2">determinate of nature of these processes</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.190" end="00:53:12.090" style="s2">right so we can talk about order and</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.560" end="00:53:15.490" style="s2">ordering or whatever right but again</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.090" end="00:53:16.960" style="s2">this basic notion right of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.490" end="00:53:20.290" style="s2">acknowledgment of a certain level of</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.960" end="00:53:23.080" style="s2">chaos you know I do recognize that and I</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.290" end="00:53:25.180" style="s2">think that&#39;s that&#39;s very primary to what</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.080" end="00:53:26.860" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to put forth right so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.180" end="00:53:28.930" style="s2">like I&#39;m not gonna I&#39;m not gonna sit</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.860" end="00:53:30.940" style="s2">here and just be you know the content of</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.930" end="00:53:32.460" style="s2">you know a few lines that appeared in</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.940" end="00:53:34.720" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s work or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.460" end="00:53:36.670" style="s2">I&#39;m not a Peterson scholar I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.720" end="00:53:38.260" style="s2">many people are Peterson scholars though</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.670" end="00:53:40.420" style="s2">I probably you know spent more time</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.260" end="00:53:43.780" style="s2">reading his books then the vast majority</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.420" end="00:53:45.840" style="s2">of his fans even but I will say that I</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.780" end="00:53:48.430" style="s2">think the basic matrix that I&#39;m positing</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.840" end="00:53:50.230" style="s2">you know it&#39;s not suddenly rendered you</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.430" end="00:53:51.970" style="s2">know totally invalid on the basis of</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.230" end="00:53:54.970" style="s2">this sort of critique if it is I would</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.970" end="00:53:57.490" style="s2">appreciate if you explain that well only</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.970" end="00:54:00.160" style="s2">in only in that it&#39;s such a it&#39;s such</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.490" end="00:54:02.380" style="s2">it&#39;s so core it&#39;s like to understand the</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.160" end="00:54:05.590" style="s2">nature of what he means when he says too</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.380" end="00:54:08.350" style="s2">much order it&#39;s like it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.590" end="00:54:10.720" style="s2">blood component of his teaching and so</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.350" end="00:54:14.050" style="s2">if you get that wrong it&#39;s like anything</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.720" end="00:54:15.280" style="s2">underneath its gonna be wrong okay so is</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.050" end="00:54:20.400" style="s2">plain to me you have to explain to me</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.280" end="00:54:20.400" style="s2">how that functions right because</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.030" end="00:54:28.300" style="s2">ordering you said that he says stop</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.760" end="00:54:29.530" style="s2">ordering that&#39;s not what he says and so</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.300" end="00:54:32.170" style="s2">you&#39;re saying something he actually</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.530" end="00:54:33.220" style="s2">didn&#39;t say okay but you have to explain</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.170" end="00:54:34.600" style="s2">to me you have to explain to me the</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.220" end="00:54:36.220" style="s2">importance of that to the systemic</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.600" end="00:54:38.620" style="s2">structure that&#39;s being put forth well</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.220" end="00:54:40.900" style="s2">because if it&#39;s happening at a surface</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.620" end="00:54:43.870" style="s2">level which a nice one I mean my surface</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.900" end="00:54:45.720" style="s2">level was like like that&#39;s a package</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.870" end="00:54:48.040" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.720" end="00:54:50.680" style="s2">too much order that&#39;s a package and</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.040" end="00:54:52.570" style="s2">then what underlies that is tons of</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.680" end="00:54:54.580" style="s2">information but if you&#39;re expressing</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.570" end="00:54:56.920" style="s2">your especially in that top layer wrong</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.580" end="00:54:59.500" style="s2">it&#39;s like okay you&#39;re just repeating the</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.920" end="00:55:00.880" style="s2">same thing when you&#39;re repeating this</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.500" end="00:55:01.930" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying why do you have to go</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.880" end="00:55:03.130" style="s2">deeper I mean I&#39;m asking you to go</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.930" end="00:55:04.720" style="s2">deeper right you may not have to go</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.130" end="00:55:06.190" style="s2">deeper you may not feel you have to go</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.720" end="00:55:08.680" style="s2">deeper but I&#39;m so you know why that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.190" end="00:55:11.710" style="s2">wrong okay because it&#39;s too much</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.680" end="00:55:14.800" style="s2">ordering is to say that it&#39;s bad to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.710" end="00:55:16.330" style="s2">ordering too much and is actually what</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.800" end="00:55:18.370" style="s2">he&#39;s saying is it&#39;s good to be doing it</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.330" end="00:55:20.350" style="s2">constantly so that that expression too</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.370" end="00:55:23.230" style="s2">much ordering is and is it Nanak it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.350" end="00:55:25.450" style="s2">the expression since leading okay but</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.230" end="00:55:31.690" style="s2">the process of ordering involves the the</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.450" end="00:55:32.680" style="s2">mediation of chaos right sure but I</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.690" end="00:55:35.320" style="s2">don&#39;t see that&#39;s relevant</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.680" end="00:55:36.700" style="s2">um it&#39;s not relevant well but it would</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.320" end="00:55:39.790" style="s2">be relevant right because what it would</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.700" end="00:55:41.110" style="s2">mean is that you know you can you can</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.790" end="00:55:44.500" style="s2">refer to it in terminologically</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.110" end="00:55:46.420" style="s2">different ways right you can say you</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.500" end="00:55:49.870" style="s2">know the mediation of order and chaos or</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.420" end="00:55:53.200" style="s2">the super proliferation of order as</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.870" end="00:55:54.850" style="s2">ordering you know in this mediation but</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.200" end="00:55:55.660" style="s2">again we&#39;re not talking about some if</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.850" end="00:55:57.670" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about something really</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.660" end="00:55:59.170" style="s2">fundamentally different I would just ask</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.670" end="00:56:01.600" style="s2">you to illustrate very concretely why</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.170" end="00:56:05.650" style="s2">you can this is something a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.600" end="00:56:07.690" style="s2">Peterson fans do right you know is that</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.650" end="00:56:09.100" style="s2">they take you know some kind of semiotic</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.690" end="00:56:10.240" style="s2">slippage or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.100" end="00:56:12.760" style="s2">you know and they say and they declare</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.240" end="00:56:15.250" style="s2">someone the order is a noun ordering as</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.760" end="00:56:19.420" style="s2">a verb it&#39;s like that&#39;s the chasm we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.250" end="00:56:22.360" style="s2">dealing with man yeah that&#39;s good let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.420" end="00:56:24.760" style="s2">go jump it time uh um I just wanted like</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.360" end="00:56:28.090" style="s2">Conrad you was we have other people and</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.760" end="00:56:29.740" style="s2">be sensitive to the questions like you</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.090" end="00:56:31.300" style="s2">can if you want to maybe have a little</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.740" end="00:56:33.390" style="s2">bit more of exchange here but I just</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.300" end="00:56:40.830" style="s2">want to just check in the pulse pressure</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.390" end="00:56:40.830" style="s2">okay Billy you had a question</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.170" end="00:56:49.000" style="s2">yeah in in the the presentation you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.510" end="00:56:53.170" style="s2">given I was kind of interested in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.000" end="00:56:59.530" style="s2">role of the idea of being in accordance</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.170" end="00:57:01.590" style="s2">with nature and just wondering about how</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.530" end="00:57:04.970" style="s2">the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.590" end="00:57:07.650" style="s2">of nature was for the Greeks versus</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.970" end="00:57:10.670" style="s2">today with our with our evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.650" end="00:57:16.050" style="s2">psychology kind of perspective on things</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.670" end="00:57:21.000" style="s2">because to me a big a big question is</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.050" end="00:57:24.720" style="s2">whether we should be acting mainly in</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.000" end="00:57:30.420" style="s2">service of our own pleasure while we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.720" end="00:57:33.630" style="s2">here or if if we feel like medically if</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.420" end="00:57:35.820" style="s2">we try if we make any attempt to go</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.630" end="00:57:38.490" style="s2">against nature we will inevitably be</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.820" end="00:57:41.670" style="s2">pushed back because it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.490" end="00:57:46.130" style="s2">swimming upstream and that it will be</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.670" end="00:57:51.810" style="s2">futile to do anything that goes against</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.130" end="00:57:56.280" style="s2">these kind of like the mimetic try try</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.810" end="00:58:00.590" style="s2">to create memes that don&#39;t flow in</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.280" end="00:58:04.710" style="s2">accordance with what evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.590" end="00:58:08.940" style="s2">biology says we must behave according to</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.710" end="00:58:12.710" style="s2">the laws of which I I see like things</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.940" end="00:58:15.620" style="s2">like what Peterson says about about his</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.710" end="00:58:22.320" style="s2">relation to nature as being kind of</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.620" end="00:58:25.560" style="s2">about just the futility of trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.320" end="00:58:27.960" style="s2">things that like in a game theory</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.560" end="00:58:31.080" style="s2">perspective you&#39;re you&#39;re the memes that</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.960" end="00:58:35.910" style="s2">tell you to go against nature will die</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.080" end="00:58:45.840" style="s2">out so so what did the Greeks think of</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.910" end="00:58:47.880" style="s2">nature and and I guess Marx as well well</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.840" end="00:58:49.830" style="s2">so there&#39;s a lot in that question so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.880" end="00:58:51.840" style="s2">just gonna maybe focus on the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.830" end="00:58:54.960" style="s2">more succinct or concise way you put it</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.840" end="00:58:56.610" style="s2">forth at the end just for starters you</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.960" end="00:58:57.720" style="s2">know one thing that is elided a little</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.610" end="00:58:59.850" style="s2">bit by this presentation is how</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.720" end="00:59:03.240" style="s2">different in certain ways the modern</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.850" end="00:59:09.950" style="s2">conception of nature is compared to the</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.240" end="00:59:12.150" style="s2">ancient Greek one right so you know the</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.950" end="00:59:13.710" style="s2">in ancient Greece you have the fuses</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.150" end="00:59:14.760" style="s2">right which is different than the</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.710" end="00:59:17.430" style="s2">conception of</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.760" end="00:59:19.590" style="s2">of nature in the modern sense right sort</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.430" end="00:59:21.180" style="s2">of something created by a cosmic</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.590" end="00:59:22.860" style="s2">watchmaker or God or whatever you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.180" end="00:59:25.200" style="s2">that can be sort of be mechanically</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.860" end="00:59:27.750" style="s2">manipulated in this way so the fuses is</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.200" end="00:59:31.620" style="s2">actually constantly in a process of a</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.750" end="00:59:35.880" style="s2">certain kind of transformation right but</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.620" end="00:59:37.890" style="s2">I think again what what even though you</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.880" end="00:59:41.790" style="s2">had this idea of the fuses you still see</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.890" end="00:59:43.290" style="s2">something very common within in ancient</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.790" end="00:59:45.240" style="s2">Greek philosophy which is sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.290" end="00:59:47.150" style="s2">metaphysical generalization of nature so</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.240" end="00:59:49.200" style="s2">even if it&#39;s more kind of amorphous</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.150" end="00:59:53.040" style="s2">portrayal you still have that that</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.200" end="00:59:54.600" style="s2">strong tendency and I think the</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.040" end="00:59:56.670" style="s2">importance of someone like Darwin in</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.600" end="00:59:58.380" style="s2">this respect is that he furnishes</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.670" end="01:00:00.150" style="s2">scientific justification for the</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.380" end="01:00:01.920" style="s2">transform transform ability of nature</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.150" end="01:00:03.300" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t function purely on the</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.920" end="01:00:07.680" style="s2">level of a kind of metaphysical</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.300" end="01:00:11.180" style="s2">supposition right if that makes sense</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.680" end="01:00:14.700" style="s2">you know of course even Darwin is</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.180" end="01:00:16.460" style="s2">precipitated by efforts to think you</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.700" end="01:00:20.430" style="s2">know the transform ability of nature</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.460" end="01:00:22.380" style="s2">against you know the more absolute</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.430" end="01:00:24.360" style="s2">schemas that were common to in sort of</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.380" end="01:00:29.670" style="s2">the empiricist ideologies emanating from</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.360" end="01:00:30.960" style="s2">the English world so of course you can</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.670" end="01:00:32.900" style="s2">talk about people like shelling or</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.960" end="01:00:35.100" style="s2">Goethe for example in German Romanticism</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.900" end="01:00:37.560" style="s2">you know showing associate with nature</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.100" end="01:00:39.590" style="s2">philosophy Goethe also associate with</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.560" end="01:00:44.700" style="s2">nature philosophy so you know again</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.590" end="01:00:46.530" style="s2">prior to Darwin right we have an effort</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.700" end="01:00:49.160" style="s2">a more speculative effort even within</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.530" end="01:00:51.870" style="s2">that European context to think against</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.160" end="01:00:54.360" style="s2">you know this more mechanical and</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.870" end="01:00:59.250" style="s2">absolute conception of nature does that</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.360" end="01:01:03.830" style="s2">do that hope it&#39;ll I guess I guess I</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.250" end="01:01:03.830" style="s2">don&#39;t completely understand the</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.190" end="01:01:10.940" style="s2">diffusive concept because it&#39;s it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.290" end="01:01:17.730" style="s2">different from what I have been kind of</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.940" end="01:01:23.640" style="s2">raised with an understanding of but it</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.730" end="01:01:28.000" style="s2">is if if we&#39;re trying to practice like</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.640" end="01:01:30.810" style="s2">stoicism today it is</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.000" end="01:01:34.530" style="s2">like there&#39;s a lot of knowledge about</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.810" end="01:01:39.730" style="s2">about what nature is that has</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.530" end="01:01:43.330" style="s2">transformed some of some of these ideas</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.730" end="01:01:50.290" style="s2">and brought to light some understanding</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.330" end="01:01:53.050" style="s2">of of the nature and and like to me to</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.290" end="01:01:59.110" style="s2">me it is I&#39;ve kind of been vacillating</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.050" end="01:02:04.090" style="s2">between this idea of it&#39;s futile to to</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.110" end="01:02:08.380" style="s2">try to do any project that is not</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.090" end="01:02:10.690" style="s2">aligned with what appears to be the kind</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.380" end="01:02:14.470" style="s2">of attractive attractor points of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.690" end="01:02:16.180" style="s2">dynamics of evolution which means it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.470" end="01:02:18.430" style="s2">kind of futile to go against like</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.180" end="01:02:22.300" style="s2">hierarchies and stuff and Pareto</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.430" end="01:02:27.070" style="s2">principle because we observe that that</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.300" end="01:02:33.280" style="s2">is kind of an attractor that seems to</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.070" end="01:02:36.790" style="s2">exist and and just it seemed like</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.280" end="01:02:39.610" style="s2">Epicurus there is something about you</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.790" end="01:02:44.370" style="s2">should be in accordance with nature but</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.610" end="01:02:47.500" style="s2">not if certain other things happen and</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.370" end="01:02:50.470" style="s2">and that the stoicism also had something</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.500" end="01:02:53.530" style="s2">like that yeah yeah there are there are</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.470" end="01:02:56.470" style="s2">exceptions that are placed into it for</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.530" end="01:03:00.060" style="s2">sure I mean I think to try to get it</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.470" end="01:03:02.380" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying about the notion of I</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.060" end="01:03:04.330" style="s2">mean you talked about hierarchy and the</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.380" end="01:03:06.730" style="s2">inevitability of that to our modern day</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.330" end="01:03:09.130" style="s2">conception of nature and I think we have</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.730" end="01:03:12.580" style="s2">to understand kind of the historical</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.130" end="01:03:17.830" style="s2">specific idea - right so when when</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.580" end="01:03:19.330" style="s2">Darwin is is writing you know one of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.830" end="01:03:22.210" style="s2">things that Karl Marx observes about</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.330" end="01:03:24.250" style="s2">Darwin is that in a certain way his work</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.210" end="01:03:26.860" style="s2">is greatly influenced by Malthus right</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.250" end="01:03:29.470" style="s2">now Malthus Minister classical political</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.860" end="01:03:33.370" style="s2">economists you know sort of posited that</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.470" end="01:03:36.220" style="s2">we have to you know it&#39;s preferable to</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.370" end="01:03:38.880" style="s2">starve out the poor because of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.220" end="01:03:41.979" style="s2">tendency of populations to proliferate</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.880" end="01:03:44.439" style="s2">exponentially whereas food supplies</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.979" end="01:03:45.819" style="s2">grow linearly which like if that were</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.439" end="01:03:48.489" style="s2">ever true it would have been true in a</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.819" end="01:03:49.809" style="s2">pre-industrial context right but the</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.489" end="01:03:53.079" style="s2">point is there&#39;s actually a tension in</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.809" end="01:03:54.459" style="s2">Darwin in the Origin of Species between</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.079" end="01:03:56.650" style="s2">to what degree he&#39;s saying like the</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.459" end="01:03:59.079" style="s2">strongest win and what degree he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.650" end="01:04:04.869" style="s2">describing a more plastic and alia Tory</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.079" end="01:04:07.059" style="s2">process right and so it&#39;s his cousin you</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.869" end="01:04:08.969" style="s2">know Francis Galton really gets into</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.059" end="01:04:13.239" style="s2">this with like survival of the fittest</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.969" end="01:04:15.400" style="s2">and that proliferate sin - social</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.239" end="01:04:16.749" style="s2">Darwinism in the 20th century but again</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.400" end="01:04:18.309" style="s2">the part of the reason I&#39;m not so</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.749" end="01:04:19.630" style="s2">uncomfortable associating marks a bit</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.309" end="01:04:21.640" style="s2">with Darwin is because I know that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.630" end="01:04:23.949" style="s2">the only way you can read Darwin right</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.640" end="01:04:26.829" style="s2">um so there&#39;s something deeply retro in</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.949" end="01:04:28.420" style="s2">a way when Peterson looks to nature and</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.829" end="01:04:33.789" style="s2">always sees in it and it&#39;s no surprise</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.420" end="01:04:36.279" style="s2">here that that sorry just went outside</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.789" end="01:04:37.660" style="s2">but there&#39;s something very very retro</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.279" end="01:04:39.339" style="s2">when Peterson looks to nature and all he</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.660" end="01:04:41.319" style="s2">sees are these very very you know tidy</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.339" end="01:04:42.489" style="s2">principles of hierarchy so tidy that</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.319" end="01:04:44.069" style="s2">they can form with these pre given</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.489" end="01:04:46.599" style="s2">mathematical structures apparently right</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.069" end="01:04:48.339" style="s2">like if you look at Stephen Jay Gould</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.599" end="01:04:53.199" style="s2">like if you look at the research he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.339" end="01:04:56.289" style="s2">done on evolution his big sort of hot</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.199" end="01:04:58.719" style="s2">take is that there&#39;s like a high level</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.289" end="01:05:00.699" style="s2">of contingency that&#39;s involved right in</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.719" end="01:05:04.179" style="s2">the evolutionary process you know and</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.699" end="01:05:07.119" style="s2">that&#39;s quite credible scientifically so</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.179" end="01:05:08.859" style="s2">I think I think generally the real</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.119" end="01:05:12.999" style="s2">challenge of thinking stoicism today is</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.859" end="01:05:14.319" style="s2">how do you how do you connect the Greek</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.999" end="01:05:17.670" style="s2">notion of fuses is there a way of</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.319" end="01:05:22.719" style="s2">connecting the Greek notion of fuses to</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.670" end="01:05:25.650" style="s2">the more contingent and variable</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.719" end="01:05:29.829" style="s2">portrayal of nature and evolution that</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.650" end="01:05:32.469" style="s2">we see having overtaken to a large</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.829" end="01:05:34.509" style="s2">extent today these more you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.469" end="01:05:35.559" style="s2">hierarchical simplistically hierarchical</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.509" end="01:05:37.059" style="s2">conceptions</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.559" end="01:05:38.499" style="s2">now the simplistically hierarchical ins</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.059" end="01:05:40.989" style="s2">conception still have a lot of currency</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.499" end="01:05:42.609" style="s2">within popular culture but again within</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.989" end="01:05:46.239" style="s2">science I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.609" end="01:05:49.479" style="s2">dominant element right does that does</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.239" end="01:05:51.789" style="s2">that help could I take a stab at my</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.479" end="01:05:52.749" style="s2">interpretation of Billie&#39;s question sure</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.789" end="01:05:55.329" style="s2">sure</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.749" end="01:05:55.630" style="s2">so what came to mind and what Billie is</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.329" end="01:05:58.660" style="s2">asked</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.630" end="01:06:00.940" style="s2">was kind of this example I visited a</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.660" end="01:06:03.430" style="s2">monastery in Nepal and I tried to</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.940" end="01:06:04.480" style="s2">meditate with the monks there and I</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.430" end="01:06:05.800" style="s2">thought it was really interesting like</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.480" end="01:06:08.260" style="s2">on the first day people are coming in at</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.800" end="01:06:09.910" style="s2">5:00 a.m. and one guy would always try</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.260" end="01:06:12.340" style="s2">to come in a little bit earlier the next</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.910" end="01:06:14.380" style="s2">day and so on and by the time I&#39;d left</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.340" end="01:06:15.940" style="s2">three weeks later like it was like kind</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.380" end="01:06:18.970" style="s2">of ever like the first guy was coming in</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.940" end="01:06:20.380" style="s2">at 4:42 and I was kind of like kind of</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.970" end="01:06:21.730" style="s2">intrigued by that that like that</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.380" end="01:06:23.020" style="s2">starting point was going forward and</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.730" end="01:06:24.550" style="s2">basically I&#39;d asked him like what the</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.020" end="01:06:27.100" style="s2">hell you doing they were competing to be</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.550" end="01:06:28.480" style="s2">the first one there and what they were</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.100" end="01:06:31.510" style="s2">spending their time doing was you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.480" end="01:06:36.880" style="s2">obviously different aspects to Buddhism</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.510" end="01:06:39.400" style="s2">often around yeah it was just it was it</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.880" end="01:06:42.790" style="s2">was hilarious to see people learning</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.400" end="01:06:45.510" style="s2">about kind of the limits and foolishness</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.790" end="01:06:47.440" style="s2">of ambition and all of that and yet like</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.510" end="01:06:48.970" style="s2">instinctively like without him them you</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.440" end="01:06:50.860" style="s2">noticing like competing to try to be the</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.970" end="01:06:52.450" style="s2">next Abbot by being you know the first</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.860" end="01:06:54.730" style="s2">one there in the abbot having it praised</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.450" end="01:06:57.730" style="s2">there&#39;s another meditation teacher named</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.730" end="01:06:59.710" style="s2">John Yates behind a popular book called</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.730" end="01:07:03.220" style="s2">mind illuminated and in spite of how</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.710" end="01:07:04.540" style="s2">enlightened he got he recently kind of</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.220" end="01:07:06.280" style="s2">lost his position because he was just</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.540" end="01:07:09.670" style="s2">caught like sleeping with tons and tons</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.280" end="01:07:11.860" style="s2">of prostitutes and so I guess maybe</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.670" end="01:07:14.170" style="s2">that&#39;s what it is it&#39;s like you can try</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.860" end="01:07:16.840" style="s2">to do all these things but you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.170" end="01:07:18.370" style="s2">like that you still have that animal</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.840" end="01:07:20.770" style="s2">part of you and so in spite of your best</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.370" end="01:07:23.050" style="s2">intentions that natural light or</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.770" end="01:07:24.820" style="s2">whatever is still going to come out I</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.050" end="01:07:26.080" style="s2">guess is Billy would that would that be</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.820" end="01:07:28.450" style="s2">a better without being understand well</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.080" end="01:07:31.030" style="s2">okay so here&#39;s here&#39;s something for you</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.450" end="01:07:32.530" style="s2">like you know again and my supervisor</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.030" end="01:07:34.840" style="s2">Catherine Malibu is working a bit on</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.530" end="01:07:38.320" style="s2">this question now you know if you look</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.840" end="01:07:40.000" style="s2">at what&#39;s the name of the book if you</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.320" end="01:07:40.600" style="s2">look at the famous anarchist Peter</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.000" end="01:07:44.320" style="s2">Kropotkin</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.600" end="01:07:48.120" style="s2">he wrote a sort of very famous the title</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.320" end="01:07:50.950" style="s2">alludes me now but it&#39;s a response to</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.120" end="01:07:54.130" style="s2">you know the co-opting of Darwinism to</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.950" end="01:07:56.230" style="s2">justify you know inequities social</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.130" end="01:07:58.030" style="s2">hierarchies and what he discusses in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.230" end="01:07:59.170" style="s2">book is the absolute essential &#39;ti of</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.030" end="01:08:02.080" style="s2">the development of forms of social</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.170" end="01:08:03.220" style="s2">cooperation both to evolution as well as</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.080" end="01:08:05.590" style="s2">to the formation of different societies</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.220" end="01:08:07.720" style="s2">so I guess you know when you talk about</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.590" end="01:08:09.310" style="s2">the animal part right I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.720" end="01:08:12.670" style="s2">already very very risky to is so</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.310" end="01:08:15.730" style="s2">ta you know necessarily don&#39;t literally</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.670" end="01:08:17.740" style="s2">on those words okay um but but this is</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.730" end="01:08:18.760" style="s2">what I&#39;m saying right like here&#39;s here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.740" end="01:08:21.190" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting right because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.760" end="01:08:22.810" style="s2">talking about you know these sort of</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.190" end="01:08:23.770" style="s2">values you know whatever I think or</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.810" end="01:08:25.330" style="s2">anyone else thinks about these values</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.770" end="01:08:26.800" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about how one should</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.330" end="01:08:28.960" style="s2">overcome ambition and this kind of thing</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.800" end="01:08:30.609" style="s2">well you know and I&#39;m not not</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.960" end="01:08:31.569" style="s2">attributing it to directly to you but</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.609" end="01:08:36.190" style="s2">just saying if we&#39;re talking about these</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.569" end="01:08:38.290" style="s2">higher-order moral concerns I think the</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.190" end="01:08:40.030" style="s2">real question would be is it possible</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.290" end="01:08:42.250" style="s2">that those are actually imminent to the</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.030" end="01:08:43.990" style="s2">structure of nature so that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.250" end="01:08:47.560" style="s2">way of updating the stoic conception of</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.990" end="01:08:49.990" style="s2">nature so that you know it&#39;s not just oh</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.560" end="01:08:53.260" style="s2">you have like a base selfishness then</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.990" end="01:08:56.500" style="s2">you have this external you know set of</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.260" end="01:08:58.120" style="s2">set of higher injunctions right can we</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.500" end="01:09:00.819" style="s2">can we develop a conception of nature</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.120" end="01:09:03.640" style="s2">that that you know supports a refinement</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.819" end="01:09:06.550" style="s2">of this way of thinking in its totality</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.640" end="01:09:09.100" style="s2">I guess another way then to respond to</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.550" end="01:09:10.150" style="s2">that would be like Harare has this great</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.100" end="01:09:11.470" style="s2">thing where he&#39;s like the most important</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.150" end="01:09:13.810" style="s2">thing in my life is meditation</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.470" end="01:09:16.030" style="s2">and if everybody meditated the way I did</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.810" end="01:09:18.339" style="s2">like the role would be saved but</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.030" end="01:09:19.870" style="s2">meditation is not scalable and so like</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.339" end="01:09:21.970" style="s2">kind of to Billy&#39;s point like like</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.870" end="01:09:24.670" style="s2">there&#39;s a minority of us who have enough</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.970" end="01:09:26.650" style="s2">metacognitive power now enough ability</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.670" end="01:09:28.960" style="s2">to take short-term pain for long-term</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.650" end="01:09:31.150" style="s2">gain and apply knowledge over these</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.960" end="01:09:32.859" style="s2">evolutionary impulses but to Billy&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.150" end="01:09:34.780" style="s2">point I guess it&#39;s like that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.859" end="01:09:39.700" style="s2">scalable because it comes in to contrast</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.780" end="01:09:40.870" style="s2">with these evolutionary patterns and so</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.700" end="01:09:42.250" style="s2">that would be the question I guess I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.870" end="01:09:44.260" style="s2">asking is is this inherently an</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.250" end="01:09:46.690" style="s2">unscalable approach well maybe maybe</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.260" end="01:09:49.000" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s not scalable maybe it is I</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.690" end="01:09:50.859" style="s2">mean you know because I think that one</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.000" end="01:09:53.040" style="s2">thing you know going back to the way</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.859" end="01:09:55.210" style="s2">that Marx use biology and his early work</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.040" end="01:10:03.190" style="s2">you know I think one thing we see is</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.210" end="01:10:05.740" style="s2">that you know the UM you know I think I</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.190" end="01:10:07.150" style="s2">think I think belief often functions you</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.740" end="01:10:08.350" style="s2">know in its religious form as a crocks</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.150" end="01:10:11.290" style="s2">for people who are going through very</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.350" end="01:10:15.310" style="s2">very negative circumstances but I also</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.290" end="01:10:20.770" style="s2">think that you know get like a less</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.310" end="01:10:23.119" style="s2">dogmatic form of concern with these sort</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.770" end="01:10:25.429" style="s2">of more elevated moral questions so</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.119" end="01:10:27.499" style="s2">speak is more common amongst people who</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.429" end="01:10:29.629" style="s2">already enjoy certain level of social</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.499" end="01:10:30.949" style="s2">comfort right and we already see this</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.629" end="01:10:33.289" style="s2">you know in North America like corporate</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.949" end="01:10:37.610" style="s2">Buddhism okay you know like and so on</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.289" end="01:10:39.260" style="s2">Madonna&#39;s Kabbalah and so on um and you</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.610" end="01:10:41.329" style="s2">know without saying like well that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.260" end="01:10:42.590" style="s2">good right what I want to say is that I</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.329" end="01:10:45.949" style="s2">think in a way if you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.590" end="01:10:48.139" style="s2">expose people to you know having the</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.949" end="01:10:49.820" style="s2">time to reflect and kind of develop</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.139" end="01:10:52.399" style="s2">themselves I think one way of</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.820" end="01:10:55.300" style="s2">approaching it is you know what you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.399" end="01:10:57.439" style="s2">Kent are we bestowing people with the</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.300" end="01:11:00.229" style="s2">you know material conditions they need</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.439" end="01:11:01.699" style="s2">to do that and are we creating an</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.229" end="01:11:03.820" style="s2">intellectual culture in which those kind</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.699" end="01:11:07.129" style="s2">of opportunities are in addition</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.820" end="01:11:08.539" style="s2">available to to all people so I think</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.129" end="01:11:10.579" style="s2">the question of scalability has to be</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.539" end="01:11:13.249" style="s2">addressed very broadly in that way I</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.579" end="01:11:15.019" style="s2">think the point from Billy if I</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.249" end="01:11:17.209" style="s2">interpret correctly and the way I would</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.019" end="01:11:19.039" style="s2">do is like it&#39;s exactly that even if you</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.209" end="01:11:20.539" style="s2">were to get the norms right and even if</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.039" end="01:11:23.179" style="s2">you were to do all the things you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.539" end="01:11:25.429" style="s2">saying right it&#39;s the point here is what</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.179" end="01:11:31.280" style="s2">if it still is only 10% of people yeah</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.429" end="01:11:34.099" style="s2">well I mean what the way I mean is more</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.280" end="01:11:35.989" style="s2">like if I analogize it to the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.099" end="01:11:38.510" style="s2">not being in accordance with nature is</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.989" end="01:11:42.610" style="s2">kind of like trying to swim upstream I</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.510" end="01:11:47.780" style="s2">mean it&#39;s it&#39;s possible it&#39;s just you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.610" end="01:11:49.999" style="s2">get it you&#39;ll be there&#39;s a chance that</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.780" end="01:11:54.919" style="s2">you&#39;ll be making all this effort and</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.999" end="01:12:01.820" style="s2">just nature and and this this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.919" end="01:12:05.329" style="s2">inherent and tropic principle of nature</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.820" end="01:12:08.209" style="s2">will be working almost exactly well</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.329" end="01:12:11.899" style="s2">maybe not exactly well maybe you&#39;ll make</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.209" end="01:12:15.229" style="s2">some progress but it seems to me like</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.899" end="01:12:17.149" style="s2">like there&#39;s lots of traditions that the</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.229" end="01:12:18.979" style="s2">various extents what whether it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.149" end="01:12:23.479" style="s2">changes in society or changes in</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.979" end="01:12:26.659" style="s2">yourself like like in in Zen practices</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.479" end="01:12:30.320" style="s2">and as well as this stoicism and stuff</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.659" end="01:12:32.689" style="s2">they all talk about a need to be in</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.320" end="01:12:33.609" style="s2">accordance with nature versus some some</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.689" end="01:12:37.550" style="s2">traditions</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.609" end="01:12:42.770" style="s2">the idea is to is that</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.550" end="01:12:47.180" style="s2">our nature is sinful and that what we</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.770" end="01:12:51.410" style="s2">need to do is to try to escape from from</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.180" end="01:12:58.160" style="s2">our nature in a way versus living in</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.410" end="01:13:02.600" style="s2">harmony with it and I&#39;m just and and</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.160" end="01:13:04.250" style="s2">it&#39;s just that Jordan Peterson seems</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.600" end="01:13:08.620" style="s2">because he&#39;s very interested in</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.250" end="01:13:11.150" style="s2">evolutionary biology it seems like that</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.620" end="01:13:14.810" style="s2">like this being in accordance with</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.150" end="01:13:19.010" style="s2">nature is kind of part of the reason why</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.810" end="01:13:20.690" style="s2">he makes a big deal out of oh this is</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.010" end="01:13:23.840" style="s2">what we observe in nature and therefore</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.690" end="01:13:27.010" style="s2">you should live in harmony and</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.840" end="01:13:30.140" style="s2">acceptance of this being the way that</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.010" end="01:13:34.100" style="s2">things are not necessarily that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.140" end="01:13:36.770" style="s2">impossible to go against them but that</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.100" end="01:13:40.750" style="s2">you will live a more harmonious life if</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.770" end="01:13:44.290" style="s2">you if you take it as a given that</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.750" end="01:13:47.480" style="s2">things will go in a certain direction</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.290" end="01:13:49.160" style="s2">before you respond Conrad I want to</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.480" end="01:13:53.570" style="s2">sneak in one more question so if you can</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.160" end="01:13:55.310" style="s2">respond that I&#39;ll call trumping do you</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.570" end="01:13:57.530" style="s2">do you want to respond to build oh sorry</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.310" end="01:14:00.950" style="s2">yeah I&#39;ll respond and then you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.530" end="01:14:02.390" style="s2">ask a question okay yeah so yeah I just</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.950" end="01:14:03.080" style="s2">wanted to say very quickly you know I</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.390" end="01:14:06.500" style="s2">think these are all interesting</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.080" end="01:14:09.650" style="s2">questions I think in a way you know and</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.500" end="01:14:11.570" style="s2">it&#39;s no mystery that you you know there</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.650" end="01:14:13.220" style="s2">was a get a much more positive view of</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.570" end="01:14:14.090" style="s2">religion than Freud did for example for</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.220" end="01:14:15.950" style="s2">Freud it was a kind of collective</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.090" end="01:14:18.470" style="s2">neurosis that&#39;s outlasted its</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.950" end="01:14:20.270" style="s2">significance you know I mean ultimately</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.470" end="01:14:22.610" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s the terribleness of the world</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.270" end="01:14:25.280" style="s2">which you know is supposedly</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.610" end="01:14:30.620" style="s2">scientifically gauge able that causes</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.280" end="01:14:34.220" style="s2">Peterson - you know positively evaluate</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.620" end="01:14:37.790" style="s2">the need for these kind of somewhat</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.220" end="01:14:40.130" style="s2">escapist spiritual notions not totally</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.790" end="01:14:41.630" style="s2">right because of the the mediation of</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.130" end="01:14:45.560" style="s2">order and chaos are ordering or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.630" end="01:14:46.790" style="s2">I don&#39;t but I you know but I think what</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.560" end="01:14:48.140" style="s2">it really speaks to again I consider</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.790" end="01:14:50.570" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s concept is nature quite</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.140" end="01:14:51.320" style="s2">limited and reductive and I think what</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.570" end="01:14:55.340" style="s2">it really speaks to</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.320" end="01:14:58.010" style="s2">that if you&#39;re going to if you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.340" end="01:14:59.599" style="s2">to base your philosophy on a conception</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.010" end="01:15:01.250" style="s2">of nature which we see in a way is true</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.599" end="01:15:02.420" style="s2">of all of Marx&#39;s work more directly in</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.250" end="01:15:03.710" style="s2">the early work but even in the way to</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.420" end="01:15:05.900" style="s2">work I said we see this parallel between</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.710" end="01:15:08.300" style="s2">the fluidity of dialectic and the</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.900" end="01:15:09.320" style="s2">fluidity of evolution that you have to</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.300" end="01:15:12.590" style="s2">make pretty sure you have a good</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.320" end="01:15:14.860" style="s2">conception of nature right and I think</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.590" end="01:15:16.790" style="s2">that you know for stoicism especially</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.860" end="01:15:19.610" style="s2">for this kind of discourse I think</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.790" end="01:15:22.730" style="s2">that&#39;s a really good place to start is</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.610" end="01:15:26.360" style="s2">is you know what what conception of</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.730" end="01:15:28.369" style="s2">nature we&#39;re using so I just want to</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.360" end="01:15:29.810" style="s2">just be honest at the time we have to</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.369" end="01:15:33.469" style="s2">close up exactly ten minutes I got</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.810" end="01:15:35.690" style="s2">another another call after this so the</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.469" end="01:15:37.880" style="s2">question that I had is referring back to</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.690" end="01:15:42.170" style="s2">the slide on the the white paper the</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.880" end="01:15:43.790" style="s2">cultural white paper so first I&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.170" end="01:15:46.040" style="s2">like I have like I&#39;m not attached to any</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.790" end="01:15:49.820" style="s2">of the propositions on that paper it was</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.040" end="01:15:52.790" style="s2">more sort of I viewed as a psychoactive</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.820" end="01:15:53.989" style="s2">drug that could help people see like</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.790" end="01:15:55.730" style="s2">that current culture landscape</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.989" end="01:15:58.130" style="s2">differently instead of like a bipolar</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.730" end="01:16:02.060" style="s2">world or as a multipolar world and then</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.130" end="01:16:03.320" style="s2">the speculative proposals they were just</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.060" end="01:16:06.170" style="s2">speculative number one and they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.320" end="01:16:08.540" style="s2">a panacea but they were also selfishly</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.170" end="01:16:10.940" style="s2">motivated or there&#39;s a selfish bias</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.540" end="01:16:13.489" style="s2">there because when I wrote that paper</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.940" end="01:16:17.000" style="s2">and I still today there&#39;s like you know</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.489" end="01:16:19.400" style="s2">being not having a political home having</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.000" end="01:16:22.790" style="s2">that feeling and and being this state of</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.400" end="01:16:24.920" style="s2">a knowingness and just being like having</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.790" end="01:16:27.860" style="s2">a thirst for real dialogue so I can</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.920" end="01:16:30.500" style="s2">figure out what the heck is going on and</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.860" end="01:16:32.179" style="s2">then especially then and now to the</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.500" end="01:16:33.949" style="s2">environment when you think in public</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.179" end="01:16:36.170" style="s2">this is what the felt sense that I had</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.949" end="01:16:38.420" style="s2">is that there was a dangerous game to</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.170" end="01:16:40.190" style="s2">play and not just from kind of like the</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.420" end="01:16:41.960" style="s2">social justice activist but from all</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.190" end="01:16:44.329" style="s2">kinds of medic tribes reactionary or</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.960" end="01:16:46.550" style="s2">whatever it felt like you&#39;re being the</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.329" end="01:16:48.110" style="s2">medically gaslighted and attacked for</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.550" end="01:16:49.699" style="s2">thinking something that does not</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.110" end="01:16:53.329" style="s2">correspond to what they believe to be</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.699" end="01:16:54.530" style="s2">true and then there is this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.329" end="01:16:56.119" style="s2">sense of making space we talk about</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.530" end="01:16:58.790" style="s2">others as meta crisis where there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.119" end="01:17:00.619" style="s2">sort of like ecology of existential risk</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.790" end="01:17:02.750" style="s2">and suffering risks and you know social</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.619" end="01:17:05.000" style="s2">economic issues is definitely one of</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.750" end="01:17:06.920" style="s2">them so I&#39;m fully on board that we</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.000" end="01:17:10.130" style="s2">need to have what you said a</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.920" end="01:17:13.550" style="s2">socio-economic solution but I&#39;m curious</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.130" end="01:17:17.870" style="s2">how what do you think the role of good</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.550" end="01:17:20.180" style="s2">dialogue is in regards to that which</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.870" end="01:17:21.620" style="s2">those speculate proposals a lot of them</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.180" end="01:17:24.530" style="s2">not all of them but a lot of the gesture</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.620" end="01:17:25.940" style="s2">towards do you mean do you mean how do</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.530" end="01:17:28.310" style="s2">you mean like do you mean good dialogue</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.940" end="01:17:29.720" style="s2">like as regards socio-economic issues or</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.310" end="01:17:33.500" style="s2">just can you frame that a little for me</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.720" end="01:17:34.760" style="s2">yeah so so like let&#39;s say good dialogue</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.500" end="01:17:38.350" style="s2">that will help resolve the medical</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.760" end="01:17:45.460" style="s2">crisis including social economic issues</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.350" end="01:17:51.530" style="s2">okay um I mean I think for me I think a</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.460" end="01:17:54.800" style="s2">big problem is that you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.530" end="01:17:56.990" style="s2">real hesitancy it I think in our in our</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.800" end="01:18:01.970" style="s2">world and and I don&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.990" end="01:18:02.720" style="s2">approach it narrowly and and you know so</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.970" end="01:18:05.390" style="s2">naturalistically</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.720" end="01:18:08.360" style="s2">but this is one thing I do you know kind</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.390" end="01:18:14.000" style="s2">of like about Peterson&#39;s cynicism is I</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.360" end="01:18:15.890" style="s2">think there&#39;s a real hesitancy you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.000" end="01:18:18.440" style="s2">by anyone especially who has achieved</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.890" end="01:18:20.960" style="s2">any level of privilege and I don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.440" end="01:18:24.470" style="s2">that in like the SJW sense just you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.960" end="01:18:26.630" style="s2">in general to acknowledge the important</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.470" end="01:18:29.300" style="s2">role that forms of social determination</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.630" end="01:18:30.380" style="s2">play in where we are right so if you</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.300" end="01:18:31.730" style="s2">look in the United States your</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.380" end="01:18:33.860" style="s2">likelihood of going to university is</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.730" end="01:18:37.790" style="s2">exactly the same as the wealth level of</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.860" end="01:18:39.260" style="s2">your parents right and you know again if</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.790" end="01:18:40.970" style="s2">you get a discourse like philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.260" end="01:18:42.920" style="s2">right I think a big part of the problem</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.970" end="01:18:44.960" style="s2">is that most of the people who have the</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.920" end="01:18:47.690" style="s2">ability to study philosophy are already</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.960" end="01:18:49.700" style="s2">people who come from these you know more</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.690" end="01:18:51.500" style="s2">affluent backgrounds you know if you</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.700" end="01:18:53.000" style="s2">tell someone who comes from a more</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.500" end="01:18:54.770" style="s2">socially mobile kind of bourgeois</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.000" end="01:18:56.510" style="s2">background if you say well look you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.770" end="01:18:57.650" style="s2">very socially determined I find they</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.510" end="01:18:59.270" style="s2">almost always have a very negative</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.650" end="01:19:00.830" style="s2">reaction to it um if you tell</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.270" end="01:19:02.360" style="s2">working-class people that the reaction</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.830" end="01:19:04.390" style="s2">is usually less negative because they</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.360" end="01:19:06.110" style="s2">live that known that in many cases for</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.390" end="01:19:09.110" style="s2">every day of their lives</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.110" end="01:19:12.020" style="s2">and some way or another so again I think</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.110" end="01:19:15.350" style="s2">the first step toward you know I see a</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.020" end="01:19:18.349" style="s2">lot of these problems in terms of this</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.350" end="01:19:21.530" style="s2">anger as being</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.349" end="01:19:23.329" style="s2">driven by kind of abstract moral</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.530" end="01:19:25.519" style="s2">presentation of how people develop these</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.329" end="01:19:27.530" style="s2">views right and I think when you</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.519" end="01:19:29.239" style="s2">consider how much were structured by our</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.530" end="01:19:30.709" style="s2">communities how much were structured by</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.239" end="01:19:32.689" style="s2">our families how much was destructed by</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.709" end="01:19:35.300" style="s2">our level of wealth I&#39;m we talking about</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.689" end="01:19:37.849" style="s2">race gender so many things I think that</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.300" end="01:19:39.109" style="s2">in a way it becomes easier in a certain</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.849" end="01:19:42.769" style="s2">way to facilitate dialogue because</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.109" end="01:19:44.239" style="s2">you&#39;re not just blaming people right you</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.769" end="01:19:46.369" style="s2">know for the disposition that they have</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.239" end="01:19:47.689" style="s2">right of course I do think people have</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.369" end="01:19:51.109" style="s2">access to more education of more</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.689" end="01:19:52.159" style="s2">responsibility to probe right because of</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.109" end="01:19:53.629" style="s2">that that privilege that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.159" end="01:19:55.639" style="s2">bestowed with but I think it&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.629" end="01:19:58.099" style="s2">important when you engage with anyone to</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.639" end="01:20:00.349" style="s2">try to appreciate how their positions</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.099" end="01:20:01.609" style="s2">and including our own by the way right I</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.349" end="01:20:02.929" style="s2">don&#39;t mean to say like one&#39;s gonna be a</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.609" end="01:20:05.359" style="s2">philosopher God and helper above</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.929" end="01:20:06.559" style="s2">everyone on the contrary it&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.359" end="01:20:09.409" style="s2">important to consider the way those are</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.559" end="01:20:11.090" style="s2">structured by social factors but again</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.409" end="01:20:12.619" style="s2">that also requires because you know</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.090" end="01:20:15.050" style="s2">philosophy as a sort of bourgeois</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.619" end="01:20:17.300" style="s2">discourse has this accept obsession with</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.050" end="01:20:19.280" style="s2">kind of freedom and social flight I</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.300" end="01:20:22.280" style="s2">think it requires a kind of remedial</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.280" end="01:20:25.999" style="s2">intervention into philosophy you know to</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.280" end="01:20:27.760" style="s2">try to accept social determination as a</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.999" end="01:20:33.499" style="s2">way of addressing it and reducing it</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.760" end="01:20:35.119" style="s2">right does that kind of make sense the</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.499" end="01:20:37.010" style="s2">other may just double-check the time so</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.119" end="01:20:38.449" style="s2">my understanding is that you need a</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.010" end="01:20:41.719" style="s2">really good kind of social economic</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.449" end="01:20:44.119" style="s2">analysis on people&#39;s sort of positions</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.719" end="01:20:45.859" style="s2">so you get a feel of like the I guess</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.119" end="01:20:47.269" style="s2">the privilege hierarchy and so then you</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.859" end="01:20:50.899" style="s2">can address it accordingly</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.269" end="01:20:55.249" style="s2">appropriately to the context yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.899" end="01:21:00.739" style="s2">yeah and I think like I think you know I</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.249" end="01:21:01.969" style="s2">think this this you know I I think this</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.739" end="01:21:03.619" style="s2">is like very very common to how our</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.969" end="01:21:05.300" style="s2">ideological structure works or you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.619" end="01:21:06.800" style="s2">really understand the implicit and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.300" end="01:21:07.969" style="s2">not encouraged necessarily to understand</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.800" end="01:21:10.459" style="s2">the imperatives the drive different</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.969" end="01:21:14.510" style="s2">groups right so again like you know you</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.459" end="01:21:16.039" style="s2">look at now like this whole kind of you</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.510" end="01:21:17.479" style="s2">know talk about breaking down a dialogue</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.039" end="01:21:20.030" style="s2">if you look a little anti-china thing</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.479" end="01:21:21.409" style="s2">that&#39;s emerging right it&#39;s like you know</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.030" end="01:21:22.639" style="s2">and invariably we always look at China</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.409" end="01:21:23.959" style="s2">and we say like and I&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.639" end="01:21:25.699" style="s2">everything is right or anything like</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.959" end="01:21:27.070" style="s2">that but it&#39;s very easy to look at it</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.699" end="01:21:29.449" style="s2">and say well they&#39;re not you know</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.070" end="01:21:31.129" style="s2">liberal-democratic like us or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.449" end="01:21:32.340" style="s2">um but it&#39;s like wait how did our</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.129" end="01:21:34.710" style="s2">republics emerge</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.340" end="01:21:35.850" style="s2">was that peaceful you know because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.710" end="01:21:37.890" style="s2">pretty sure it wasn&#39;t when we were that</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.850" end="01:21:39.690" style="s2">dis unified right so when you actually</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.890" end="01:21:42.170" style="s2">situate something like the Chinese</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.690" end="01:21:45.000" style="s2">political project in a certain kind of</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.170" end="01:21:46.190" style="s2">socio-economic structure you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.000" end="01:21:48.270" style="s2">not like saying well this is just good</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.190" end="01:21:51.390" style="s2">right but it gives you a basis to</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.270" end="01:21:52.560" style="s2">actually have an honest dialogue you</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.390" end="01:21:53.580" style="s2">know and I think the same you know if</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.560" end="01:21:56.040" style="s2">you&#39;re approaching anyone like someone</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.580" end="01:21:57.750" style="s2">from an older generation men and women</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.040" end="01:22:01.580" style="s2">across social classes I think it really</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.750" end="01:22:04.460" style="s2">really helps have that framework right</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.580" end="01:22:08.430" style="s2">right so you&#39;re gonna just appropriately</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.460" end="01:22:11.640" style="s2">one thing terms that I like it was like</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.430" end="01:22:13.710" style="s2">civility porn and then I think another</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.640" end="01:22:16.800" style="s2">would be like dialogue porn he looks</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.710" end="01:22:18.630" style="s2">like by a sort of proselytizing dialogue</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.800" end="01:22:21.090" style="s2">in a certain way that&#39;s tone-deaf from</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.630" end="01:22:22.260" style="s2">you know certain kind of different</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.090" end="01:22:27.360" style="s2">analysis then I think that could be</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.260" end="01:22:30.270" style="s2">dangerous or not productive so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.360" end="01:22:40.050" style="s2">wrap it up there Conor have any closing</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.270" end="01:22:42.720" style="s2">thoughts for us yeah yeah I think I</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.050" end="01:22:46.860" style="s2">think you know I just want to stress</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.720" end="01:22:51.500" style="s2">that you know it makes sense if someone</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.860" end="01:22:56.240" style="s2">is trying to defend you know somewhat</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.500" end="01:22:59.010" style="s2">you know kind of strictly sort of rigid</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.240" end="01:23:02.280" style="s2">conceptions of social hierarchy that</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.010" end="01:23:08.040" style="s2">they would appeal to those kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.280" end="01:23:10.530" style="s2">ideas in nature and you know again I</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.040" end="01:23:12.990" style="s2">think I think nature is is is but I do</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.530" end="01:23:14.850" style="s2">think nature is much more variable than</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.990" end="01:23:16.470" style="s2">we give it credit for</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.850" end="01:23:20.970" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of potential for flux</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.470" end="01:23:23.010" style="s2">contingency radical change and so forth</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.970" end="01:23:24.420" style="s2">and I just want to you know I want to</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.010" end="01:23:27.090" style="s2">point out you know if we talk about</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.420" end="01:23:31.410" style="s2">Peterson very often</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.090" end="01:23:33.510" style="s2">he uses the word merit right you know we</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.410" end="01:23:34.680" style="s2">need societies based on merit well this</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.510" end="01:23:40.860" style="s2">is very interesting right where does the</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.680" end="01:23:44.670" style="s2">term merit come from right and you know</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.860" end="01:23:45.870" style="s2">if you look at the term merit basically</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.670" end="01:23:48.000" style="s2">it comes from this I</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.870" end="01:23:51.930" style="s2">yeah and this is laid out explicitly in</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.000" end="01:23:53.970" style="s2">an address made by the founder of seals</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.930" end="01:23:56.820" style="s2">Paul when he launched the university he</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.970" end="01:23:58.500" style="s2">says you know we&#39;re no longer us rich</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.820" end="01:24:00.960" style="s2">people us aristocrats we&#39;re no longer</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.500" end="01:24:02.940" style="s2">going to be able to dominate society</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.960" end="01:24:06.450" style="s2">just based on our vested privilege so we</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.940" end="01:24:08.310" style="s2">have to begin to acquire merit right you</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.450" end="01:24:10.650" style="s2">know in order to justify our ongoing</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.310" end="01:24:13.770" style="s2">domination now the term meritocracy</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.650" end="01:24:16.880" style="s2">actually comes from a parody write a</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.770" end="01:24:19.560" style="s2">satirical work of this sort of ideology</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.880" end="01:24:22.260" style="s2">this kind of bourgeois rationalization</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.560" end="01:24:25.530" style="s2">of social domination on the basis of</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.260" end="01:24:28.200" style="s2">merit rather than vested privilege so</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.530" end="01:24:29.460" style="s2">again I think you know there&#39;s the pub</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.200" end="01:24:36.900" style="s2">there is a I think it can be very</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.460" end="01:24:40.140" style="s2">compelling to try to you know and</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.900" end="01:24:41.640" style="s2">worthwhile right to try to look at the</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.140" end="01:24:43.560" style="s2">structure of nature as a way of posing</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.640" end="01:24:45.510" style="s2">the question of how we ought to behave</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.560" end="01:24:47.250" style="s2">are you not dismissed that but I think</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.510" end="01:24:49.470" style="s2">we have to be very very careful about</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.250" end="01:24:52.040" style="s2">the way that a lot of people you know</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.470" end="01:24:55.530" style="s2">when they look at nature what they see</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.040" end="01:24:57.600" style="s2">is a rationalization of the dominant</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.530" end="01:25:01.190" style="s2">social order or paradoxically just a</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.600" end="01:25:04.620" style="s2">rationalization for you know a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.190" end="01:25:07.200" style="s2">intellectually pallid leftist politics</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.620" end="01:25:08.550" style="s2">and that&#39;s the risk I mean mark says and</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.200" end="01:25:10.410" style="s2">his early work he says you know the</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.550" end="01:25:12.060" style="s2">problem with the German force is when</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.410" end="01:25:16.200" style="s2">you showed in to them they don&#39;t show</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.060" end="01:25:18.180" style="s2">back right so you know I think we need</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.200" end="01:25:21.210" style="s2">to pursue the question of nature but we</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.180" end="01:25:23.510" style="s2">have to be very very sensitive about how</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.210" end="01:25:26.280" style="s2">it can be manipulated when we pursue it</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.510" end="01:25:29.070" style="s2">cool awesome so I&#39;ll make some</p>
