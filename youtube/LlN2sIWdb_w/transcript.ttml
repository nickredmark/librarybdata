<p begin="00:02:17.120" end="00:02:23.719" style="s2">life action redesign which we&#39;ve done a</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.799" end="00:02:25.700" style="s2">few times before in our kickoff calls</p>

<p begin="00:02:28.819" end="00:02:34.639" style="s2">we think put together it could look like</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.290" end="00:02:37.150" style="s2">and we&#39;ve never done it and such a big</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.639" end="00:02:41.900" style="s2">public setting just exciting</p>

<p begin="00:02:48.109" end="00:02:52.069" style="s2">things about human systems Sarah&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.120" end="00:02:54.859" style="s2">tell you a few things about how you</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.069" end="00:02:58.219" style="s2">could be here and then Nathan and I will</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.859" end="00:03:00.290" style="s2">interview one volunteer after you&#39;ve you</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.219" end="00:03:02.750" style="s2">submitted ideas of what we could</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.290" end="00:03:05.359" style="s2">redesign today before end and you read</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.750" end="00:03:07.250" style="s2">through them and we will interview one</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.359" end="00:03:09.560" style="s2">person and kind of articulate what the</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.250" end="00:03:10.609" style="s2">value at the core of their story might</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.560" end="00:03:13.489" style="s2">be that might have been really difficult</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.609" end="00:03:17.719" style="s2">to live by and then Nathan I will</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.489" end="00:03:19.189" style="s2">disappear and Joe and Sarah will guide</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.719" end="00:03:21.159" style="s2">you through two different games</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.189" end="00:03:24.079" style="s2">depending on your preference tonight</p>

<p begin="00:03:29.959" end="00:03:40.129" style="s2">half-day depending on the times when we</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.579" end="00:03:43.639" style="s2">win Joe what&#39;s human systems about hi</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.129" end="00:03:47.269" style="s2">everybody this is cool some of you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.639" end="00:03:48.560" style="s2">so I apologize I&#39;m gonna take a few</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.269" end="00:03:54.500" style="s2">sentences to tell you stuff you already</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.560" end="00:03:56.479" style="s2">know we work on redesigning things</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.500" end="00:04:02.439" style="s2">around values most of our society is</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.479" end="00:04:04.549" style="s2">designed around metrics goals norms</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.439" end="00:04:06.829" style="s2">complying with the way that people</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.549" end="00:04:13.909" style="s2">usually act or like norms like</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.829" end="00:04:15.709" style="s2">professionalism or goals like maximizing</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.909" end="00:04:17.509" style="s2">profit this kind of stuff and we have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.709" end="00:04:19.280" style="s2">kind of a shortage of systems that are</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.509" end="00:04:20.659" style="s2">designed around values and often the</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.280" end="00:04:24.800" style="s2">systems that are designed around goals</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.659" end="00:04:27.770" style="s2">or norms are they they block our values</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.800" end="00:04:30.110" style="s2">they make it harder to be creative or</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.770" end="00:04:31.400" style="s2">playful or honest or however we actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.110" end="00:04:34.070" style="s2">want to be with the people in our lives</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.400" end="00:04:36.590" style="s2">so that&#39;s what we teach is just a simple</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.070" end="00:04:39.469" style="s2">thing about figuring out what people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.590" end="00:04:43.360" style="s2">values are and how to redesign the</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.469" end="00:04:47.060" style="s2">systems of our lives</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.360" end="00:04:51.169" style="s2">organizations birthday parties dinner</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.060" end="00:04:54.160" style="s2">family dinners up to social networks</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.169" end="00:04:56.660" style="s2">earlier today I helped redesign a</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.160" end="00:05:00.050" style="s2">difficult family dinner arrangement and</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.660" end="00:05:01.850" style="s2">a social network but according to values</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.050" end="00:05:03.800" style="s2">so that&#39;s what we do and that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.850" end="00:05:06.500" style="s2">what we&#39;re gonna demonstrate today and</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.800" end="00:05:08.570" style="s2">will also play a few games that show</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.500" end="00:05:09.430" style="s2">just give you a kind of clue about how</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.570" end="00:05:11.889" style="s2">we do that</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.430" end="00:05:14.570" style="s2">hopefully the demonstration will be</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.889" end="00:05:16.130" style="s2">you&#39;ll be like wow I wouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.570" end="00:05:20.690" style="s2">thought about how to redesign that</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.130" end="00:05:23.930" style="s2">myself and if you do have that reaction</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.690" end="00:05:33.260" style="s2">then we can help you learn to redesign</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.930" end="00:05:38.750" style="s2">things the way we do cool I guess I talk</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.260" end="00:05:42.320" style="s2">now so I want to give a couple of things</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.750" end="00:05:43.789" style="s2">to keep in mind while you&#39;re here to</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.320" end="00:05:44.960" style="s2">help you get the most out of it because</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.789" end="00:05:48.380" style="s2">this is actually gonna be pretty</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.960" end="00:05:49.940" style="s2">participatory the first part where we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.380" end="00:05:51.380" style="s2">taken a couple of submissions before the</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.940" end="00:05:55.160" style="s2">column we&#39;ve chosen one person that</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.380" end="00:05:56.720" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna do a redesign for and so the</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.160" end="00:05:57.830" style="s2">human systems members will be asking</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.720" end="00:05:59.240" style="s2">them some questions to get the</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.830" end="00:06:01.550" style="s2">information they need to do the redesign</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.240" end="00:06:03.260" style="s2">but we&#39;ll also be asking you what sort</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.550" end="00:06:05.030" style="s2">of questions would you need to do this</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.260" end="00:06:07.099" style="s2">we design because afterwards you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.030" end="00:06:08.750" style="s2">going to get the chance to split into</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.099" end="00:06:10.580" style="s2">groups and one of the groups is going to</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.750" end="00:06:13.729" style="s2">try their hands at doing redesigns too</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.580" end="00:06:15.919" style="s2">so the first rule this is to keep your</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.729" end="00:06:17.419" style="s2">brain on think about like what</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.919" end="00:06:20.510" style="s2">information would you need to know to</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.419" end="00:06:22.970" style="s2">redesign systems and also maybe keep in</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.510" end="00:06:24.349" style="s2">mind a system of your own and just kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.970" end="00:06:28.130" style="s2">of call this to mind right now like if</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.349" end="00:06:30.229" style="s2">you had expert help what situation in</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.130" end="00:06:33.409" style="s2">your life do you feel is not letting you</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.229" end="00:06:34.909" style="s2">live in the way that you want to because</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.409" end="00:06:36.770" style="s2">we have this really different world with</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.909" end="00:06:38.419" style="s2">quarantine and I was I was just on a</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.770" end="00:06:40.310" style="s2">call with Google earlier where you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.419" end="00:06:44.240" style="s2">some of the people were like um you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.310" end="00:06:45.590" style="s2">eating more than I want to or I&#39;m kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.240" end="00:06:46.970" style="s2">of having trouble having meetings where</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.590" end="00:06:48.830" style="s2">I can feel really connected to people</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.970" end="00:06:50.419" style="s2">what are the what&#39;s one thing you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.830" end="00:06:52.430" style="s2">struggling with and and you can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.419" end="00:06:55.650" style="s2">use that as a reference point as we play</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.430" end="00:06:59.290" style="s2">these games and do these redesigns</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.650" end="00:07:01.000" style="s2">and the other part of this is we get a</p>

<p begin="00:09:15.920" end="00:09:20.149" style="s2">disappointed</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.050" end="00:09:21.709" style="s2">particularly at one of the guys that was</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.149" end="00:09:26.389" style="s2">doing this because he was one of my</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.709" end="00:09:29.120" style="s2">friends so I yeah I I confronted him</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.389" end="00:09:30.860" style="s2">about it I said you know you should be</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.120" end="00:09:33.199" style="s2">doing this I can get some you know</p>

<p begin="00:09:36.290" end="00:09:43.810" style="s2">think you should be doing it and he made</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.610" end="00:09:45.980" style="s2">me feel like I was the person that was</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.810" end="00:09:50.060" style="s2">betraying him because I was threatening</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.980" end="00:09:52.639" style="s2">to tell the boss and if I did that then</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.060" end="00:09:55.399" style="s2">I would be harming him because I would</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.639" end="00:09:58.459" style="s2">you know be causing him to lose his job</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.399" end="00:10:01.940" style="s2">so he made me feel like I was the one</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.459" end="00:10:04.459" style="s2">that was being unfair and it it wasn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:10:08.750" end="00:10:13.279" style="s2">and you know the bosses are under paying</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.779" end="00:10:14.930" style="s2">you and everyone else in the business so</p>

<p begin="00:10:20.120" end="00:10:23.269" style="s2">putting a really awkward decision</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.170" end="00:10:26.209" style="s2">because I valued my friendship with this</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.269" end="00:10:29.500" style="s2">guy previously I really enjoyed hanging</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.209" end="00:10:32.839" style="s2">out with it but he really made me feel</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.500" end="00:10:35.420" style="s2">just kind of well because I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.839" end="00:10:38.540" style="s2">preserve my friendship with him but I</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.420" end="00:10:40.040" style="s2">also didn&#39;t want the business to fail</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.540" end="00:10:46.160" style="s2">and didn&#39;t want that habit negative pick</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.040" end="00:10:49.519" style="s2">on me thank you</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.160" end="00:10:51.920" style="s2">ya know but they like the rest of the</p>

<p begin="00:10:51.920" end="00:10:58.220" style="s2">what did you do it well actually like I</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.230" end="00:10:59.180" style="s2">end up doing absolutely nothing I like</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.220" end="00:11:01.519" style="s2">it really</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.180" end="00:11:04.910" style="s2">I read deliberated over for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.519" end="00:11:06.380" style="s2">but I just did nothing and I regretted</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.910" end="00:11:10.100" style="s2">not doing that because eventually the</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.380" end="00:11:13.010" style="s2">whole situation unraveled because he</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.100" end="00:11:15.800" style="s2">sent him emails who is I think like</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.010" end="00:11:19.250" style="s2">Chris who is the other co-conspirator</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.800" end="00:11:21.260" style="s2">and he accidentally cc&#39;d everyone in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.250" end="00:11:22.780" style="s2">business and revealed like the whole</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.260" end="00:11:27.050" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.780" end="00:11:29.690" style="s2">so it was yeah like basically shit hit</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.050" end="00:11:33.260" style="s2">the fan and as you say I guess we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.690" end="00:11:36.380" style="s2">stay in Australia and like the his whole</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.260" end="00:11:40.910" style="s2">couple was blowing and you know the</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.380" end="00:11:44.480" style="s2">situation unraveled anywhere so I really</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.910" end="00:11:45.350" style="s2">liked what I you know what I realized</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.480" end="00:11:47.510" style="s2">that I should have done at that point</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.350" end="00:11:55.660" style="s2">it&#39;s just like I should have told the</p>

<p begin="00:14:38.470" end="00:14:46.000" style="s2">like the way that this company was set</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.640" end="00:14:48.790" style="s2">up like you had clients yeah they were</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.000" end="00:14:49.580" style="s2">running like the guy the boss is the guy</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.790" end="00:14:51.830" style="s2">that started to come</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.580" end="00:14:53.630" style="s2">and hired you guys on to help deal with</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.830" end="00:14:55.280" style="s2">these clients that gun more and more how</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.630" end="00:14:58.520" style="s2">did that work how do you just get built</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.280" end="00:15:02.300" style="s2">up sure yeah the company was started by</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.520" end="00:15:05.030" style="s2">two guys and then it grew to enable and</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.300" end="00:15:09.590" style="s2">it was a marketing agency so we had like</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.030" end="00:15:17.300" style="s2">quite a large number of clients and you</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.590" end="00:15:18.680" style="s2">know a elaborate scheme to try and to</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.300" end="00:15:21.710" style="s2">try and steal the clients where they</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.680" end="00:15:23.630" style="s2">would register domain names that were</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.710" end="00:15:26.210" style="s2">very similar to the clients domain names</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.630" end="00:15:28.400" style="s2">so then they could send emails through</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.210" end="00:15:31.850" style="s2">the clock to the business pretending to</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.400" end="00:15:33.050" style="s2">be the clients so they could spoof email</p>

<p begin="00:16:54.050" end="00:16:58.430" style="s2">he yeah so Chris started the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.930" end="00:17:01.700" style="s2">and then he tried to recruit other</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.430" end="00:17:02.910" style="s2">people my other colleagues into the into</p>

<p begin="00:17:26.100" end="00:17:30.660" style="s2">along with it so I didn&#39;t consider him</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.200" end="00:17:36.260" style="s2">as guilty as the guy who organized the</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.660" end="00:17:39.150" style="s2">whole thing but yeah what&#39;s this like I</p>

<p begin="00:17:42.810" end="00:17:45.270" style="s2">you kind of felt like you weren&#39;t able</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.800" end="00:17:47.220" style="s2">to like show up with this courage and</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.270" end="00:17:52.920" style="s2">integrity or were there other moments</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.220" end="00:17:57.540" style="s2">that like we&#39;re all so difficult no I</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.920" end="00:18:00.510" style="s2">always felt like I was able to to work</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.540" end="00:18:03.270" style="s2">with integrity and an honor and tell the</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.510" end="00:18:06.540" style="s2">truth this is the first time that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.270" end="00:18:08.670" style="s2">encountered that yeah okay so it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.540" end="00:18:11.490" style="s2">of the it&#39;s because of his friend</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.670" end="00:18:13.890" style="s2">essentially yeah yeah it was just you</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.490" end="00:18:19.080" style="s2">know I was just worried about losing</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.890" end="00:18:19.920" style="s2">this friendship because yeah and the</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.080" end="00:18:22.440" style="s2">other thing that made it quite difficult</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.920" end="00:18:24.210" style="s2">is like you know my friend said to me I</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.440" end="00:18:26.700" style="s2">hey you know this is this isn&#39;t a big</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.210" end="00:18:28.140" style="s2">deal what I&#39;m doing because the bosses</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.700" end="00:18:29.700" style="s2">are under paying you and there are under</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.140" end="00:18:32.310" style="s2">paying everyone else they&#39;re making all</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.700" end="00:18:36.540" style="s2">this money and because I didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.310" end="00:18:38.190" style="s2">access to you know any of the finances I</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.540" end="00:18:42.060" style="s2">didn&#39;t know whether I was being</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.190" end="00:18:48.480" style="s2">underpaid or not so I had to kind of you</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.060" end="00:18:53.370" style="s2">know maybe I am being screwed over by</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.480" end="00:18:56.040" style="s2">the boss here so maybe maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.370" end="00:19:02.010" style="s2">actually consider this but I didn&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.040" end="00:19:03.590" style="s2">to if you could go back now and talk to</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.010" end="00:19:05.940" style="s2">yourself when you&#39;re in that situation</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.590" end="00:19:11.700" style="s2">like what did what advice would you give</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.940" end="00:19:15.080" style="s2">to yourself I would say you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.700" end="00:19:16.690" style="s2">to worry about losing your friendship I</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.080" end="00:19:21.400" style="s2">because the friendship</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.690" end="00:19:22.930" style="s2">was already lost anyway like I I felt</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.400" end="00:19:25.330" style="s2">betrayed by him so I didn&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.930" end="00:19:28.180" style="s2">his friend so I really didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.330" end="00:19:32.380" style="s2">anything to lose by telling the boss</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.180" end="00:19:34.870" style="s2">what was happening I mean did you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.380" end="00:19:36.370" style="s2">that at the time I&#39;m kind of wondering</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.870" end="00:19:38.740" style="s2">what would you say to yourself if you</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.370" end="00:19:41.230" style="s2">were to like try to maybe this is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.740" end="00:19:42.910" style="s2">different question but again if you were</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.230" end="00:19:44.170" style="s2">to like sort of advise yourself like</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.910" end="00:19:46.570" style="s2">where are you in a situation like that</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.170" end="00:19:48.760" style="s2">right now what kind of thing would you</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.570" end="00:19:50.380" style="s2">try to focus on what would you like to</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.760" end="00:20:00.970" style="s2">pay attention to to figure out what to</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.380" end="00:20:02.830" style="s2">do what would I pay attention to I guess</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.970" end="00:20:04.990" style="s2">or outs of what I value more whether I</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.830" end="00:20:11.230" style="s2">value my friendship with my work</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.990" end="00:20:17.380" style="s2">colleague or whether I value having a</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.230" end="00:20:19.000" style="s2">secure job and a secure income whether I</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.380" end="00:20:20.890" style="s2">maybe not maybe not to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.000" end="00:20:28.080" style="s2">secure income thing maybe whether I</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.890" end="00:20:30.430" style="s2">value being able to tell the truth um</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.080" end="00:20:31.990" style="s2">you just mentioned like two or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.430" end="00:20:34.000" style="s2">three things that are kind of like hard</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.990" end="00:20:35.340" style="s2">of living with this courage and</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.000" end="00:20:36.550" style="s2">integrity in that particular situation</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.340" end="00:20:37.870" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.550" end="00:20:40.030" style="s2">one of them is maybe something like</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.870" end="00:20:42.520" style="s2">doubt maybe they&#39;re right maybe you act</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.030" end="00:20:43.990" style="s2">in screwed over by your boss in some</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.520" end="00:20:47.410" style="s2">kind of like mourning something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.990" end="00:20:48.850" style="s2">already lost yeah and then third one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.410" end="00:20:52.480" style="s2">maybe like some kind of like weighing of</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.850" end="00:20:54.760" style="s2">different importances if these three</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.480" end="00:21:01.210" style="s2">things had worked out would you have</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.760" end="00:21:06.040" style="s2">been alright well actually so what are</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.210" end="00:21:07.420" style="s2">the three things the &#39;i like maybe your</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.040" end="00:21:11.440" style="s2">boss is really screwing you over maybe</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.420" end="00:21:14.980" style="s2">they are right yeah not quite seeing</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.440" end="00:21:17.170" style="s2">that like a thing is already lost and</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.980" end="00:21:23.650" style="s2">trading off different and different</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.170" end="00:21:27.130" style="s2">interests different goals yeah well I</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.650" end="00:21:28.280" style="s2">never found out whether the owners of</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.130" end="00:21:33.140" style="s2">the business word</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.280" end="00:21:39.410" style="s2">screwing us all over and I actually did</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.140" end="00:21:43.940" style="s2">manage to salvage my friendship so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.410" end="00:21:47.060" style="s2">I guess some if I had found out that it</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.940" end="00:21:48.890" style="s2">was true then the bosses were screwing</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.060" end="00:21:57.710" style="s2">us all over then I guess I would have</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.890" end="00:21:59.720" style="s2">been okay with it I mean maybe like the</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.710" end="00:22:02.810" style="s2">thing I&#39;m curious about is if those if</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.720" end="00:22:04.400" style="s2">all of that had been easy like some</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.810" end="00:22:07.670" style="s2">magic trick would you have been alright</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.400" end="00:22:09.200" style="s2">would it have made it possible to have</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.670" end="00:22:18.580" style="s2">the curse integrity that was difficult</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.200" end="00:22:18.580" style="s2">or is there more what do you mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.820" end="00:22:24.700" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.760" end="00:22:28.270" style="s2">if in that situation those three things</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.700" end="00:22:29.950" style="s2">by some solution had been possible yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.270" end="00:22:33.430" style="s2">like you you you&#39;re absolutely sure that</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.950" end="00:22:35.260" style="s2">you&#39;re not being screwed over you fully</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.430" end="00:22:37.660" style="s2">aware that this friendship is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.260" end="00:22:38.860" style="s2">lost in some way and it&#39;s clear to you</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.660" end="00:22:39.910" style="s2">that the job is more important than the</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.860" end="00:22:42.180" style="s2">friendship would that have been enough</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.910" end="00:22:57.040" style="s2">for you to feel at ease</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.180" end="00:22:59.140" style="s2">encouragement integrity yeah because the</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.040" end="00:23:01.450" style="s2">biggest thing I was worried about was</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.140" end="00:23:11.580" style="s2">the friendship and I didn&#39;t believe that</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.450" end="00:23:15.160" style="s2">the the the friendship was lost so if I</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.580" end="00:23:17.740" style="s2">knew that I didn&#39;t have to continue</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.160" end="00:23:19.570" style="s2">being friends with this person then and</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.740" end="00:23:21.760" style="s2">I was totally comfortable with that then</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.570" end="00:23:24.610" style="s2">yeah I would have had no problem living</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.760" end="00:23:26.470" style="s2">up to that value at least I think I</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.610" end="00:23:30.610" style="s2">would it still would have been a very</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.470" end="00:23:32.230" style="s2">awkward conversation with my boss but I</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.610" end="00:23:33.800" style="s2">think I would have had the courage to do</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.230" end="00:23:36.740" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.800" end="00:23:39.910" style="s2">I just had to look at the there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.740" end="00:23:51.650" style="s2">some of the questions in the in the chat</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.910" end="00:23:53.330" style="s2">they just like check them out and one of</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.650" end="00:23:54.710" style="s2">them is what about the relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.330" end="00:23:57.070" style="s2">your friend made it hard to confront him</p>

<p begin="00:29:48.649" end="00:29:52.500" style="s2">so here&#39;s the thing I&#39;m trying to do we</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.210" end="00:29:54.149" style="s2">just kind of like talked a bit of audio</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.500" end="00:29:56.669" style="s2">story and the emotions that came up in</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.149" end="00:29:58.440" style="s2">it and kind of what was difficult what</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.669" end="00:30:00.090" style="s2">was the situation like and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.440" end="00:30:01.649" style="s2">bunch of different kinds of information</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.090" end="00:30:03.960" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to kind of filter out of</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.649" end="00:30:06.480" style="s2">that which you&#39;ll see again later how</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.960" end="00:30:09.179" style="s2">they come back there&#39;s one very specific</p>

<p begin="00:30:09.179" end="00:30:11.909" style="s2">for and that is kind of the thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.590" end="00:30:13.950" style="s2">important in the situation that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.909" end="00:30:15.090" style="s2">difficult and I think we&#39;re very close</p>

<p begin="00:30:15.090" end="00:30:19.919" style="s2">integrity about honesty I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.389" end="00:30:21.690" style="s2">something about like boundaries or like</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.919" end="00:30:24.330" style="s2">like asserting yourself some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.690" end="00:30:25.740" style="s2">assertiveness and I&#39;m mostly just kind</p>

<p begin="00:30:25.740" end="00:30:29.789" style="s2">particular neurons of it like what</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.809" end="00:30:34.379" style="s2">exactly is this kind of assertiveness it</p>

<p begin="00:37:25.049" end="00:37:31.920" style="s2">going to try something and this is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.079" end="00:37:33.900" style="s2">be a bit of an experiment in full</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.920" end="00:37:35.579" style="s2">disclosure I joined human systems rather</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.900" end="00:37:37.319" style="s2">recently so I&#39;m still learning their</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.579" end="00:37:39.750" style="s2">practices as well although I do some</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.319" end="00:37:41.250" style="s2">similar things on my own and we&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.750" end="00:37:42.539" style="s2">tried to have a group just do a redesign</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.250" end="00:37:44.549" style="s2">on their own without going through the</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.539" end="00:37:46.950" style="s2">class but I thought it would be a really</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.549" end="00:37:48.720" style="s2">cool experiment to have us do the same</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.950" end="00:37:51.029" style="s2">thing that they&#39;re going away and doing</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.720" end="00:37:53.549" style="s2">and so I&#39;m gonna teach you one more of</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.029" end="00:37:55.349" style="s2">the tools that human systems uses and</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.549" end="00:37:57.960" style="s2">then I&#39;m gonna break you into groups of</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.349" end="00:38:00.029" style="s2">about four people each to try your hand</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.960" end="00:38:01.200" style="s2">at it we design and so what we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.029" end="00:38:03.869" style="s2">do first is we&#39;re gonna do something</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.200" end="00:38:06.779" style="s2">called structural features and that is</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.869" end="00:38:08.599" style="s2">if you go to the notes stock that Bilal</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.779" end="00:38:10.559" style="s2">posted I&#39;m gonna post this in chat again</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.599" end="00:38:13.730" style="s2">because this has notes on it which you</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.559" end="00:38:15.960" style="s2">might be able to use for your redesign</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.730" end="00:38:18.799" style="s2">one of the things you also see in there</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.960" end="00:38:18.799" style="s2">is a</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.330" end="00:38:28.720" style="s2">structural features document I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.410" end="00:38:31.610" style="s2">put in a shot as Wow cool so so</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.720" end="00:38:32.810" style="s2">basically like when we do a redesign the</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.610" end="00:38:35.210" style="s2">first thing that we try to do is</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.810" end="00:38:37.550" style="s2">identify what happened in a situation</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.210" end="00:38:40.250" style="s2">and then what value the person was</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.550" end="00:38:41.600" style="s2">holding because everyone everyone like</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.250" end="00:38:44.360" style="s2">cares about different things in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.600" end="00:38:47.000" style="s2">situation right like for Lachlan what</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.360" end="00:38:48.200" style="s2">his value was basically like I would say</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.000" end="00:38:51.050" style="s2">to something like staying committed to</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.200" end="00:38:54.920" style="s2">this like higher ideal that he holds</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.050" end="00:38:55.730" style="s2">regardless of the consequences but for</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.920" end="00:39:00.860" style="s2">someone else</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.730" end="00:39:01.970" style="s2">the ideal might be something like making</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.860" end="00:39:05.180" style="s2">sure that they stay true to their</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.970" end="00:39:08.360" style="s2">standard of integrity or respecting</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.180" end="00:39:10.010" style="s2">friendship or you know there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.360" end="00:39:11.870" style="s2">many different ways and and to do a</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.010" end="00:39:14.810" style="s2">redesign we need to understand what we</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.870" end="00:39:16.670" style="s2">need to keep in mind because if we do a</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.810" end="00:39:20.870" style="s2">whole redesign and it doesn&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.670" end="00:39:22.730" style="s2">keep in mind that value like then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.870" end="00:39:25.660" style="s2">not gonna be effective for him might be</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.730" end="00:39:28.490" style="s2">effective for whoever did that we design</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.660" end="00:39:30.140" style="s2">so the other thing that we that helps us</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.490" end="00:39:31.700" style="s2">do these redesigns is thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.140" end="00:39:35.990" style="s2">what are the features of the situation</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.700" end="00:39:40.820" style="s2">that are unique so the the graph the</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.990" end="00:39:42.110" style="s2">chart the chart posted gives some of</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.820" end="00:39:44.570" style="s2">these and there might be others as well</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.110" end="00:39:47.720" style="s2">and so what I want to invite is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.570" end="00:39:50.420" style="s2">gonna try to put in chat what are things</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.720" end="00:39:52.070" style="s2">that were characteristics of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.420" end="00:39:56.210" style="s2">situation with Lachlan that could maybe</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.070" end="00:39:58.730" style="s2">be changed an example of one might be</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.210" end="00:40:06.140" style="s2">that the interactions were just going on</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.730" end="00:40:10.160" style="s2">between him and his coworker so we call</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.140" end="00:40:12.200" style="s2">that instead of being the size was like</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.160" end="00:40:14.000" style="s2">you know a small number of people so 1 2</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.200" end="00:40:15.380" style="s2">1 imagine what the situation might have</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.000" end="00:40:16.790" style="s2">been different if instead Lachlan like</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.380" end="00:40:18.920" style="s2">gathered a whole group of his co-workers</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.790" end="00:40:20.060" style="s2">to talk about it together that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.920" end="00:40:22.660" style="s2">thing that could be changed</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.060" end="00:40:25.310" style="s2">so one structural feature is group size</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.660" end="00:40:27.080" style="s2">are there any others feel free to put</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.310" end="00:40:28.310" style="s2">them in chat if you&#39;re if you&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.080" end="00:40:31.759" style="s2">understanding this at all</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.310" end="00:40:37.609" style="s2">anonymity if who submits the report</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.759" end="00:40:41.509" style="s2">like what if it had been public what</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.609" end="00:40:43.389" style="s2">things could you change lack of clarity</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.509" end="00:41:08.630" style="s2">and transparency so yeah something like</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.389" end="00:41:11.439" style="s2">who holds the information any others</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.630" end="00:41:14.179" style="s2">they don&#39;t have to be from this list but</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.439" end="00:41:17.179" style="s2">yeah norms around who you can ask for</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.179" end="00:41:18.409" style="s2">advice what would actually what I love</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.179" end="00:41:21.139" style="s2">about that is like what were the roles</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.409" end="00:41:22.459" style="s2">of people on the team and was that</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.139" end="00:41:25.479" style="s2">they&#39;re like did you have a confidant</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.459" end="00:41:25.479" style="s2">you could go to for instance</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.069" end="00:41:33.499" style="s2">expectations about value alignment where</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.509" end="00:41:34.729" style="s2">their norms so you see like as we give</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.499" end="00:41:36.319" style="s2">these there&#39;s like lots of different</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.729" end="00:41:38.659" style="s2">things when they got the type of</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.319" end="00:41:42.229" style="s2">hierarchy could you go to the managers</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.659" end="00:41:44.149" style="s2">easily for instance we don&#39;t know the</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.229" end="00:41:45.259" style="s2">depth of the relationship maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.149" end="00:41:47.149" style="s2">depth of the relationship with his</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.259" end="00:41:48.889" style="s2">friend versus with other co-workers or</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.149" end="00:41:50.689" style="s2">with other people in town like a</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.889" end="00:41:52.369" style="s2">redesign could be make friends outside</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.689" end="00:41:54.169" style="s2">of the company and then come back to the</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.369" end="00:41:58.479" style="s2">situation so you&#39;re not gonna lose so</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.169" end="00:42:03.199" style="s2">losing that friend isn&#39;t this big great</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.479" end="00:42:05.209" style="s2">so what we&#39;re gonna do now and you can</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.199" end="00:42:09.049" style="s2">keep putting these in chat if you want</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.209" end="00:42:11.239" style="s2">to but I&#39;m going to put each of y&#39;all</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.049" end="00:42:12.589" style="s2">into groups of four people and since</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.239" end="00:42:14.239" style="s2">some people have kind of been dropping</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.589" end="00:42:16.699" style="s2">in and out you might be in groups of</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.239" end="00:42:19.069" style="s2">three that&#39;s fine as well</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.699" end="00:42:20.630" style="s2">but each group is going to when you get</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.069" end="00:42:24.429" style="s2">into your group change choose one</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.630" end="00:42:26.599" style="s2">feature that you&#39;d like to work on and</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.429" end="00:42:30.439" style="s2">try to spend as little time as possible</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.599" end="00:42:33.829" style="s2">choosing a feature and then you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.439" end="00:42:36.979" style="s2">see if you can redesign the situation</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.829" end="00:42:38.299" style="s2">based on changing that feature so for</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.979" end="00:42:42.259" style="s2">instance if the feature that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.299" end="00:42:43.009" style="s2">choosing and and try to choose you can</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.259" end="00:42:44.329" style="s2">try to choose something that&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.009" end="00:42:45.200" style="s2">bit easier so like ownership of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.329" end="00:42:46.849" style="s2">company</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.200" end="00:42:49.430" style="s2">definitely one might be a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.849" end="00:42:50.750" style="s2">harder to change something like like you</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.430" end="00:42:52.910" style="s2">know depth what I was just saying like</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.750" end="00:42:54.349" style="s2">you have that this person is a good</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.910" end="00:42:56.690" style="s2">acquaintance so where else could you</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.349" end="00:42:58.099" style="s2">find depths of friendship if it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.690" end="00:43:00.680" style="s2">with that person what might be a</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.099" end="00:43:02.210" style="s2">redesign what can you change the depth</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.680" end="00:43:05.660" style="s2">of friendship with this person or make</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.210" end="00:43:07.010" style="s2">yourself less dependent on them what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.660" end="00:43:08.780" style="s2">the quality of relationship with other</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.010" end="00:43:10.460" style="s2">people and you&#39;re not gonna have all the</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.780" end="00:43:11.660" style="s2">options obviously because you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.460" end="00:43:15.410" style="s2">Lachlan unless you have them in yours</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.660" end="00:43:16.940" style="s2">group in which case you kind of win so</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.410" end="00:43:18.770" style="s2">you can kind of like make up some of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.940" end="00:43:21.079" style="s2">details if you don&#39;t have them cuz part</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.770" end="00:43:24.760" style="s2">of this is just really a chance to try</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.079" end="00:43:29.540" style="s2">your hand at this and you&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.760" end="00:43:32.420" style="s2">about 10 minutes or so to try doing a</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.540" end="00:43:35.089" style="s2">redesign and my suggestion is for the</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.420" end="00:43:38.270" style="s2">first four or five minutes of that just</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.089" end="00:43:40.670" style="s2">bling storm like all the things you can</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.270" end="00:43:42.890" style="s2">imagine changing about this feature all</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.670" end="00:43:44.750" style="s2">the creative you know ways you can play</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.890" end="00:43:46.490" style="s2">with it if you want to step outside the</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.750" end="00:43:48.970" style="s2">future and like you know suggest some</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.490" end="00:43:51.140" style="s2">other redesigns that&#39;s fine too but I</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.970" end="00:43:52.640" style="s2">find this the feature like helped sway</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.140" end="00:43:55.099" style="s2">my thoughts so it&#39;s not just this big</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.640" end="00:43:56.630" style="s2">unknown and then for the next five</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.099" end="00:43:58.940" style="s2">minutes I&#39;ll send you a message when you</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.630" end="00:44:01.010" style="s2">can stop playing storming or if you stop</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.940" end="00:44:02.030" style="s2">before that that&#39;s fine for the next</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.010" end="00:44:04.040" style="s2">couple of minutes you&#39;re gonna figure</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.030" end="00:44:07.700" style="s2">out which of those options might be best</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.040" end="00:44:11.900" style="s2">keeping in mind Laughlin&#39;s value so if</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.700" end="00:44:14.540" style="s2">his value that we&#39;ve identified is doing</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.900" end="00:44:16.790" style="s2">what you think is right without regard</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.540" end="00:44:18.319" style="s2">without holding in so high regard what</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.790" end="00:44:20.119" style="s2">other people think of you like having</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.319" end="00:44:21.740" style="s2">what is right at the top does that</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.119" end="00:44:24.260" style="s2">effect at all which sort of solution</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.740" end="00:44:26.240" style="s2">that you choose and I&#39;m gonna put that</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.260" end="00:44:31.990" style="s2">in chat again just so everyone has it</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.240" end="00:44:34.670" style="s2">handy and it&#39;s in this document great um</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.990" end="00:44:36.559" style="s2">you actually will have access to the</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.670" end="00:44:38.150" style="s2">chat and the breakouts you won&#39;t be able</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.559" end="00:44:39.349" style="s2">when you go into breakout so you can</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.150" end="00:44:41.299" style="s2">still see everything that&#39;s been posted</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.349" end="00:44:42.890" style="s2">in chat thus far but when you&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.299" end="00:44:44.599" style="s2">breakout if you post something in chat</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.890" end="00:44:46.670" style="s2">the whole group won&#39;t see it only your</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.599" end="00:44:47.960" style="s2">breakout group will see it so just keep</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.670" end="00:44:49.309" style="s2">that in mind if you want to make</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.960" end="00:44:50.720" style="s2">comments that the whole group can see</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.309" end="00:44:51.650" style="s2">maybe do it on the document and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.720" end="00:44:54.130" style="s2">we&#39;ll come back we&#39;ll give you a minute</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.650" end="00:44:56.420" style="s2">or two to share your redesigns as well</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.130" end="00:44:58.520" style="s2">any questions on this I know it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.420" end="00:44:59.210" style="s2">little bit complicated and when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.520" end="00:45:00.680" style="s2">in the group you can be</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.210" end="00:45:03.920" style="s2">your hand if you get stuck you lead a</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.680" end="00:45:06.230" style="s2">question yeah I was wondering if you</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.920" end="00:45:08.630" style="s2">could just repeat the values again and</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.230" end="00:45:11.960" style="s2">then maybe slight expansion on the idea</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.630" end="00:45:13.310" style="s2">of like the idea of not wanting to care</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.960" end="00:45:15.910" style="s2">so much what other people think of you</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.310" end="00:45:18.859" style="s2">yeah the idea that that&#39;s not a value</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.910" end="00:45:20.480" style="s2">even though it&#39;s still exerted force in</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.859" end="00:45:21.950" style="s2">his decision-making process to me seems</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.480" end="00:45:28.099" style="s2">a bit wonky I wonder if you just clarify</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.950" end="00:45:32.150" style="s2">that bit I values are aspirational so if</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.099" end="00:45:33.260" style="s2">the value Lachlan held was I want to do</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.150" end="00:45:34.970" style="s2">what&#39;s right without regard to</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.260" end="00:45:37.369" style="s2">consequence there was something that was</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.970" end="00:45:38.990" style="s2">blocking that out you like he could hold</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.369" end="00:45:40.490" style="s2">it in the situation of like getting his</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.990" end="00:45:41.990" style="s2">friend into an uber but he couldn&#39;t hold</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.490" end="00:45:43.369" style="s2">it in this situation so what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.990" end="00:45:45.849" style="s2">trying to do is remove some of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.369" end="00:45:52.790" style="s2">impediments to him holding his value</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.849" end="00:45:57.260" style="s2">okay a question um so again you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.790" end="00:45:59.210" style="s2">choose one structural feature and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.260" end="00:46:01.130" style="s2">going to try to redesign the situation</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.210" end="00:46:03.020" style="s2">by changing that feature in such a way</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.130" end="00:46:07.940" style="s2">that it&#39;s easier for Lachlan to live by</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.020" end="00:46:11.530" style="s2">his value let&#39;s give it a try if you get</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.940" end="00:46:17.540" style="s2">stuck feel free to just raise a hand and</p>

<p begin="00:58:52.030" end="00:58:55.910" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna have a little bit less time</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.990" end="00:58:58.150" style="s2">and then you thought like maybe five</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.910" end="00:58:58.150" style="s2">minutes</p>

<p begin="01:00:04.420" end="01:00:09.819" style="s2">trainers are gonna present their</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.190" end="01:00:12.160" style="s2">redesign but first I&#39;d love to just hear</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.819" end="01:00:15.549" style="s2">a couple highlights anyone who wants to</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.160" end="01:00:17.440" style="s2">share from either grave upscale like for</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.549" end="01:00:28.930" style="s2">four minutes or so to take a couple of</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.440" end="01:00:32.410" style="s2">shares so you can unmute yourself if you</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.930" end="01:00:35.229" style="s2">have something you did yeah I&#39;ll share</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.410" end="01:00:37.749" style="s2">something so myself and Rhys were in a</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.229" end="01:00:41.049" style="s2">room together and we chose the feature</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.749" end="01:00:42.609" style="s2">of expectations around a value alignment</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.049" end="01:00:44.410" style="s2">across cases so like how do you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.609" end="01:00:46.119" style="s2">what&#39;s an emergency state where you have</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.410" end="01:00:49.239" style="s2">to have a different orientation what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.119" end="01:00:50.979" style="s2">the balance of all your values and we</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.239" end="01:00:52.239" style="s2">didn&#39;t come up with full fledged</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.979" end="01:00:53.229" style="s2">solutions but we identified some</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.239" end="01:00:56.229" style="s2">features that are worth thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.229" end="01:00:58.930" style="s2">of that feature so one is that</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.229" end="01:01:00.940" style="s2">essentially you might not be able to</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.930" end="01:01:02.469" style="s2">always hire people with perfect values</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.940" end="01:01:03.999" style="s2">but you essentially want people to know</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.469" end="01:01:07.719" style="s2">their own belly so you can have a</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.999" end="01:01:09.249" style="s2">transparent discussion around how value</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.719" end="01:01:12.609" style="s2">orientation is going to change during</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.249" end="01:01:15.009" style="s2">emergencies and sort of like during you</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.609" end="01:01:16.719" style="s2">know more serious cases and so you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.009" end="01:01:19.119" style="s2">you could you could basically facilitate</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.719" end="01:01:20.619" style="s2">that you could facilitate conversations</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.119" end="01:01:23.199" style="s2">with employees that that allow them to</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.619" end="01:01:25.029" style="s2">understand their own value set and and</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.199" end="01:01:26.559" style="s2">have that sort of like marriage process</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.029" end="01:01:29.140" style="s2">between them and the company going on</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.559" end="01:01:30.900" style="s2">forward and then you could have an open</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.140" end="01:01:33.849" style="s2">and transparent conversations about what</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.900" end="01:01:36.069" style="s2">qualifies an emergency State a state</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.849" end="01:01:38.559" style="s2">where people begin to have a different</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.069" end="01:01:41.469" style="s2">balance an orientation towards balance</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.559" end="01:01:43.209" style="s2">between their different values and there</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.469" end="01:01:44.469" style="s2">was a couple of other items but I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.209" end="01:01:51.670" style="s2">skim past them because they have less</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.469" end="01:01:53.140" style="s2">detail okay thank you you Lee um so we</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.670" end="01:01:58.449" style="s2">were in the group that cheated and got</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.140" end="01:02:00.489" style="s2">Lachlan and one of the structural</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.449" end="01:02:04.209" style="s2">features that we were looking at was</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.489" end="01:02:05.709" style="s2">group size in this company it was about</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.209" end="01:02:07.810" style="s2">10 people as I said the contractors were</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.709" end="01:02:10.120" style="s2">basically working by themselves and look</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.810" end="01:02:14.080" style="s2">said they meant that it felt like he</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.120" end="01:02:15.970" style="s2">couldn&#39;t share his concerns with other</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.080" end="01:02:17.920" style="s2">people because he hadn&#39;t wasn&#39;t able to</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.970" end="01:02:20.530" style="s2">build up those relationships with other</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.920" end="01:02:23.110" style="s2">people in the company and so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.530" end="01:02:25.030" style="s2">proposing that if instead of most</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.110" end="01:02:27.340" style="s2">contractors working by themselves they</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.030" end="01:02:29.230" style="s2">worked in a group of three that when</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.340" end="01:02:31.510" style="s2">this problem came up he would have this</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.230" end="01:02:33.910" style="s2">group that he had already built quite a</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.510" end="01:02:35.710" style="s2">lot of trust with from working on</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.910" end="01:02:37.210" style="s2">existing projects and he could have not</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.710" end="01:02:38.890" style="s2">only brought it to them and discussed it</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.210" end="01:02:40.630" style="s2">with them but if they agreed then they</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.890" end="01:02:46.870" style="s2">could be his allies in confronting their</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.630" end="01:02:48.910" style="s2">a friend so let&#39;s let&#39;s get just one</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.870" end="01:02:51.160" style="s2">share from Joe&#39;s group and if you all</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.910" end="01:02:53.140" style="s2">had other solutions you came up with</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.160" end="01:02:54.340" style="s2">around structural features please feel</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.140" end="01:02:55.900" style="s2">free to put them in the chat or in the</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.340" end="01:02:59.110" style="s2">document and then we&#39;ll house our</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.900" end="01:03:06.880" style="s2">trainers present there&#39;s someone from</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.110" end="01:03:09.490" style="s2">Joseph Joe you can call him someone of</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.880" end="01:03:11.800" style="s2">you maybe Lily or Tonya could go because</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.490" end="01:03:18.700" style="s2">they both seem to have a good time and</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.800" end="01:03:19.900" style="s2">they didn&#39;t talk about sure um yeah</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.700" end="01:03:25.020" style="s2">actually I was</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.900" end="01:03:29.260" style="s2">I got a lot from Lily chair and she was</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.020" end="01:03:31.990" style="s2">noticing that there are sort of these</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.260" end="01:03:34.240" style="s2">external things that she was doing when</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.990" end="01:03:37.050" style="s2">she was trying to seem to be in</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.240" end="01:03:42.610" style="s2">alignment with a value that she had</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.050" end="01:03:45.220" style="s2">versus when she was just wanting like to</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.610" end="01:03:49.810" style="s2">be that way on her own terms it felt</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.220" end="01:03:52.150" style="s2">like Oh like I don&#39;t it was less of a an</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.810" end="01:03:53.740" style="s2">active thing I noticed it seemed to be</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.150" end="01:03:56.680" style="s2">more about sort of creating the</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.740" end="01:03:59.050" style="s2">conditions in myself for that value to</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.680" end="01:04:01.420" style="s2">emerge where is the one I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.050" end="01:04:04.150" style="s2">I&#39;m seeming trying to seem like I&#39;m that</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.420" end="01:04:07.060" style="s2">way it feels more like I&#39;m performing</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.150" end="01:04:11.520" style="s2">and externally it&#39;s more of an active</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.060" end="01:04:13.840" style="s2">external it could be performing yeah</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.520" end="01:04:16.600" style="s2">I&#39;ll just say a word of explanation</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.840" end="01:04:20.230" style="s2">which is like our exercise for those who</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.600" end="01:04:21.580" style="s2">didn&#39;t do it was about looking at the</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.230" end="01:04:24.010" style="s2">difference between how we</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.580" end="01:04:26.710" style="s2">act 2 seem certain ways so like norms</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.010" end="01:04:28.630" style="s2">that we comply with and how oxen our own</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.710" end="01:04:30.580" style="s2">terms which is often revealing of our</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.630" end="01:04:32.500" style="s2">personal values so it was a exercise</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.580" end="01:04:34.480" style="s2">about starting to look inside and see</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.500" end="01:04:36.960" style="s2">where we&#39;re operating from our values</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.480" end="01:04:40.030" style="s2">we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.960" end="01:04:41.740" style="s2">and ours identified the features of a</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.030" end="01:04:43.480" style="s2">situation that might be blocking the</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.740" end="01:04:46.630" style="s2">value and then had people do redesigns</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.480" end="01:04:49.660" style="s2">changing different features so now I</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.630" end="01:04:51.610" style="s2">want to bring our trainers back and and</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.660" end="01:04:52.930" style="s2">Nathan so that they can give us some</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.610" end="01:04:55.810" style="s2">ideas of what they came up with and you</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.930" end="01:04:59.760" style="s2">can see what every design looks like yes</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.810" end="01:04:59.760" style="s2">it&#39;s Nathan&#39;s here are you here Nathan</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.530" end="01:05:09.870" style="s2">so we just this was like like a pressure</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.410" end="01:05:17.800" style="s2">cooker</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.870" end="01:05:19.330" style="s2">whoo and we did the following we we had</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.800" end="01:05:20.980" style="s2">basically like a few questions in mind</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.330" end="01:05:22.660" style="s2">as we thought about laughlin story I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.980" end="01:05:23.950" style="s2">gonna quickly recap it because he did</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.660" end="01:05:25.390" style="s2">other things in between maybe you had</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.950" end="01:05:27.640" style="s2">amnesia and you don&#39;t know anymore what</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.390" end="01:05:29.890" style="s2">I&#39;m talking about so that I worked in a</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.640" end="01:05:32.050" style="s2">company relatively small time people and</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.890" end="01:05:33.820" style="s2">one of his colleagues was also at that</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.050" end="01:05:37.120" style="s2">time was a close friend actually one of</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.820" end="01:05:38.890" style="s2">his closest had a scheme to kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.120" end="01:05:41.460" style="s2">steal clients from the company which</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.890" end="01:05:44.620" style="s2">sounded like a bad idea but also kind of</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.460" end="01:05:50.200" style="s2">detrimental to the feeling of safety in</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.620" end="01:05:52.330" style="s2">his job and he found it difficult to</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.200" end="01:05:58.860" style="s2">speak to his boss about it and didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.330" end="01:06:01.570" style="s2">and later wish he had so he&#39;s what I did</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.860" end="01:06:08.080" style="s2">the value that we kind of articulated</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.570" end="01:06:12.550" style="s2">out of that was crawling up where did I</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.080" end="01:06:14.500" style="s2">put it yeah doing what you think is</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.550" end="01:06:17.710" style="s2">right without regard of the consequences</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.500" end="01:06:19.870" style="s2">or what other people think of you and I</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.710" end="01:06:23.070" style="s2">asked myself what&#39;s really hard about</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.870" end="01:06:25.540" style="s2">that why is it difficult to do for</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.070" end="01:06:28.990" style="s2">laughlin why would it be difficult to do</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.540" end="01:06:30.190" style="s2">for me and I&#39;m asking that because by</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.990" end="01:06:32.530" style="s2">looking for the points that are really</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.190" end="01:06:34.690" style="s2">difficult I can then think about how to</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.530" end="01:06:35.200" style="s2">make them easier so basically I look for</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.690" end="01:06:36.970" style="s2">the breaking</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.200" end="01:06:39.670" style="s2">poins why are people unable to do this</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.970" end="01:06:41.290" style="s2">thing that they really care about and in</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.670" end="01:06:43.119" style="s2">asking that I found a bunch of things</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.290" end="01:06:45.099" style="s2">and some of them are kind of</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.119" end="01:06:46.390" style="s2">surprisingly long-term they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.099" end="01:06:47.920" style="s2">actually have anything to do with the</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.390" end="01:06:49.240" style="s2">situation of talking with your boss or</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.920" end="01:06:52.920" style="s2">your friend but they start like years</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.240" end="01:06:52.920" style="s2">earlier so here here we go</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.520" end="01:06:59.260" style="s2">I&#39;m scrolling down again and my</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.660" end="01:07:01.329" style="s2">incredibly long document so one of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.260" end="01:07:03.609" style="s2">things that&#39;s important to do is kind of</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.329" end="01:07:06.160" style="s2">like having a clear feeling about what</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.609" end="01:07:07.780" style="s2">is right for you and that might involve</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.160" end="01:07:10.210" style="s2">questioning and improving your</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.780" end="01:07:15.040" style="s2">understanding of what is right</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.210" end="01:07:17.290" style="s2">evolving it over time and one one little</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.040" end="01:07:19.300" style="s2">game idea that I had how to address this</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.290" end="01:07:21.700" style="s2">is you could kind of like invite a few</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.300" end="01:07:25.140" style="s2">friends over for dinner and together you</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.700" end="01:07:27.579" style="s2">hunt for moments of uncertainty for</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.140" end="01:07:30.250" style="s2">things that you didn&#39;t quite know how to</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.579" end="01:07:32.500" style="s2">do and you play them through together</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.250" end="01:07:34.540" style="s2">and you just spend evening thinking</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.500" end="01:07:37.000" style="s2">through the things that you you were</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.540" end="01:07:38.740" style="s2">struggling making a Colin and figuring</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.000" end="01:07:40.599" style="s2">all together what a good car would have</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.740" end="01:07:42.160" style="s2">been for you to kind of take the intense</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.599" end="01:07:44.380" style="s2">pressure off the situation out and have</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.160" end="01:07:46.079" style="s2">more time to do the same thing with a</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.380" end="01:07:49.540" style="s2">bit more leisurely</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.079" end="01:07:51.190" style="s2">low-stakes another really big batch of</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.540" end="01:07:53.920" style="s2">stuff that&#39;s super hard to do about this</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.190" end="01:07:55.599" style="s2">value is reframing and building</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.920" end="01:07:57.460" style="s2">friendship asking what is friendship</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.599" end="01:07:58.750" style="s2">awards and how do I make the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.460" end="01:08:01.720" style="s2">friendship I really want to have in my</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.750" end="01:08:03.460" style="s2">life and one thing in particular that I</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.720" end="01:08:05.770" style="s2">think I would find hard in the Helens</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.460" end="01:08:08.940" style="s2">situation is to keep along and what by</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.770" end="01:08:12.720" style="s2">it wide here&#39;s the German coming through</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.940" end="01:08:15.339" style="s2">long and wide view of friendship in mind</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.720" end="01:08:16.359" style="s2">so both keep in mind what kind of</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.339" end="01:08:18.609" style="s2">friendship do I want to have with this</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.359" end="01:08:20.319" style="s2">person over the next 10 15 years but</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.609" end="01:08:23.109" style="s2">also what kinds of friends do I want to</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.319" end="01:08:25.029" style="s2">have in my life and I think one way I</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.109" end="01:08:27.009" style="s2">would address that as to give that on</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.029" end="01:08:31.150" style="s2">like an audio meditation to meditate on</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.009" end="01:08:33.219" style="s2">what friendships he wants and this</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.150" end="01:08:35.560" style="s2">process the sadness of not having that</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.219" end="01:08:36.790" style="s2">right now and checking and whether he</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.560" end="01:08:39.460" style="s2">has hope to actually make that possible</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.790" end="01:08:41.080" style="s2">or talk to a friend who&#39;s 10 15 years</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.460" end="01:08:42.640" style="s2">older and ask what friendships they</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.080" end="01:08:45.270" style="s2">really cherished and how they got them</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.640" end="01:08:45.270" style="s2">into their life</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.509" end="01:08:55.710" style="s2">mmm cool I&#39;m gonna skip these and then I</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.210" end="01:08:57.450" style="s2">think another batch of stuff that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.710" end="01:09:00.900" style="s2">really hard is in the conversation</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.450" end="01:09:03.299" style="s2">itself to notice when Lachlan kind of</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.900" end="01:09:06.569" style="s2">gets out of what he thinks is right into</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.299" end="01:09:09.120" style="s2">some kind of other mode and find his way</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.569" end="01:09:11.250" style="s2">back and this is like a gigantic batch</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.120" end="01:09:14.239" style="s2">of things that people find hard in a lot</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.250" end="01:09:14.239" style="s2">of scenarios and</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.679" end="01:09:20.370" style="s2">I thought about the best way to fix that</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.929" end="01:09:23.279" style="s2">is to change the context of the</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.370" end="01:09:27.750" style="s2">conversation which is my Chi to pass</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.279" end="01:09:29.819" style="s2">over to me right so Lachlan could have</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.750" end="01:09:31.440" style="s2">changed a number of things about how</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.819" end="01:09:34.650" style="s2">this conversation was taking place that</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.440" end="01:09:36.060" style="s2">would have made it easier for him to to</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.650" end="01:09:37.469" style="s2">do what he thought was right regardless</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.060" end="01:09:40.469" style="s2">of the consequences or what people</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.469" end="01:09:42.810" style="s2">thought of him one of them is that he</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.469" end="01:09:44.210" style="s2">there was a status thing going on he was</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.810" end="01:09:46.799" style="s2">being approached as a co-conspirator</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.210" end="01:09:49.679" style="s2">against the boss and so like you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.799" end="01:09:53.159" style="s2">in the in-group here and he could have</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.679" end="01:09:54.780" style="s2">named his agency saying something like</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.159" end="01:09:56.820" style="s2">that&#39;s a pretty strange move that you</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.780" end="01:09:58.469" style="s2">tell me about your COO before you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.820" end="01:10:02.130" style="s2">pulled it off like you might be the guy</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.469" end="01:10:07.020" style="s2">who&#39;s trying to sync my job just to name</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.130" end="01:10:09.120" style="s2">that like he&#39;s not in this group and he</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.020" end="01:10:10.170" style="s2">could have there was there evidently it</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.120" end="01:10:12.540" style="s2">seemed like these conversations were</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.170" end="01:10:13.830" style="s2">taking place in a really brief time like</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.540" end="01:10:16.409" style="s2">people were kind of like just on the</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.830" end="01:10:18.840" style="s2">side talking about it so he could have</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.409" end="01:10:20.610" style="s2">said after having established his agency</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.840" end="01:10:22.530" style="s2">and removed himself from this sort of</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.610" end="01:10:24.719" style="s2">like co-conspirator role he was being</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.530" end="01:10:27.360" style="s2">portrayed in um could have invited the</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.719" end="01:10:29.159" style="s2">other people who wanted to do this - a</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.360" end="01:10:32.370" style="s2">weekend getaway with all of the</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.159" end="01:10:34.620" style="s2">potential co-conspirators and instead of</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.370" end="01:10:36.030" style="s2">the pretext of goals which they had like</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.620" end="01:10:39.090" style="s2">well we could make more money you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.030" end="01:10:42.540" style="s2">getting screwed these kind of things he</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.090" end="01:10:44.190" style="s2">could have changed that to be about a</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.540" end="01:10:45.830" style="s2">shared value this weekend getaway is</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.190" end="01:10:49.739" style="s2">about how would we want to do business</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.830" end="01:10:52.440" style="s2">so and in that context it would have</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.739" end="01:10:54.420" style="s2">been with without being part of this</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.440" end="01:10:56.460" style="s2">conspiratorial group having named his</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.420" end="01:10:59.040" style="s2">agency having had a longer time to talk</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.460" end="01:11:01.650" style="s2">and making the conversation not about</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.040" end="01:11:04.110" style="s2">what are we gonna do but how do we want</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.650" end="01:11:06.120" style="s2">to be in business it would have been a</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.110" end="01:11:08.730" style="s2">lot easier for him to speak to what he</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.120" end="01:11:11.370" style="s2">thought was right this would have just</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.730" end="01:11:12.570" style="s2">like made it made it a like cleared a</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.370" end="01:11:17.070" style="s2">lot of the obstacles out of the way for</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.570" end="01:11:19.409" style="s2">him so yeah those are what we call</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.070" end="01:11:21.560" style="s2">structural features you guys worked on -</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.409" end="01:11:24.750" style="s2">but that&#39;s what I came up with for that</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.560" end="01:11:27.389" style="s2">and now I hand it back over to Sarah or</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.750" end="01:11:31.679" style="s2">and I guess that&#39;s all I have to say</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.389" end="01:11:33.900" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna hand it to Joe actually to</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.679" end="01:11:36.750" style="s2">close us out with a little bit about how</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.900" end="01:11:43.380" style="s2">to do more of this a lot of handing</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.750" end="01:11:46.590" style="s2">going on I have hands so this has been a</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.380" end="01:11:47.969" style="s2">little demo of what we do something that</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.590" end="01:11:50.100" style="s2">I would love to if we had a little more</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.969" end="01:11:53.219" style="s2">time with that redesign I would love to</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.100" end="01:11:55.619" style="s2">try to wrap those hard steps that Ann</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.219" end="01:11:57.389" style="s2">mentioned of living by this value and</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.619" end="01:11:59.880" style="s2">those structural feature changes that</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.389" end="01:12:03.630" style="s2">Nathan mentioned and wrap them up into a</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.880" end="01:12:05.010" style="s2">like a business structure like so that</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.630" end="01:12:08.400" style="s2">if you were starting a business with a</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.010" end="01:12:10.619" style="s2">small team you know how would you end up</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.400" end="01:12:12.690" style="s2">having shared values like Nathan was</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.619" end="01:12:15.389" style="s2">saying how would you end up making these</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.690" end="01:12:18.659" style="s2">hard steps easier for your employees or</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.389" end="01:12:20.010" style="s2">for everyone working with and and if you</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.659" end="01:12:21.360" style="s2">were able to do that as part of your</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.010" end="01:12:22.590" style="s2">business as part of the structure of</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.360" end="01:12:26.310" style="s2">your business then you would have a</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.590" end="01:12:29.670" style="s2">business in which the value that that</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.310" end="01:12:32.639" style="s2">locky wanted to live by was easier in</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.670" end="01:12:35.760" style="s2">that business and so that&#39;s kind of what</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.639" end="01:12:38.460" style="s2">we do we figure out how to make values</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.760" end="01:12:40.010" style="s2">easier to live by in different kinds of</p>
