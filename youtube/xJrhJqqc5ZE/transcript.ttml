<p begin="00:00:10.080" end="00:00:13.519" style="s2">former students and</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.280" end="00:00:14.559" style="s2">a current colleague we are working on a</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.519" end="00:00:17.680" style="s2">book together</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.559" end="00:00:20.640" style="s2">and he is daniel is here to talk to us</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.680" end="00:00:23.039" style="s2">uh today about some work he&#39;s doing on</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.640" end="00:00:25.279" style="s2">in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.039" end="00:00:26.160" style="s2">an artist collective and an alternative</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.279" end="00:00:27.680" style="s2">reality</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.160" end="00:00:29.599" style="s2">and although that sounds a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.680" end="00:00:31.840" style="s2">off topic it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.599" end="00:00:33.120" style="s2">central centrally on topic because</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.840" end="00:00:36.719" style="s2">daniel&#39;s main</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.120" end="00:00:39.840" style="s2">uh goal in all of this is to uh</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.719" end="00:00:43.040" style="s2">create a you know a</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.840" end="00:00:45.120" style="s2">widely shareable way in which people can</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.040" end="00:00:47.120" style="s2">bridge between science and spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.120" end="00:00:48.480" style="s2">which of course is the main purview of</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.120" end="00:00:51.760" style="s2">voices with for vague so</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.480" end="00:00:53.520" style="s2">welcome daniel hi yeah thanks for having</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.760" end="00:00:54.559" style="s2">me i&#39;m really excited to talk about this</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.520" end="00:00:56.800" style="s2">i&#39;ve had a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.559" end="00:00:58.079" style="s2">intellectual developments um since i</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.800" end="00:01:00.559" style="s2">just recently graduated</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.079" end="00:01:02.079" style="s2">i&#39;ve had a bit of a return to the uh</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.559" end="00:01:03.520" style="s2">artist identity that</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.079" end="00:01:05.280" style="s2">i kind of turned away from when i was</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.520" end="00:01:06.880" style="s2">doing my undergrad i really bought</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.280" end="00:01:08.479" style="s2">deeply into this sort of academic and</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.880" end="00:01:09.040" style="s2">scientific side of things i was like i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.479" end="00:01:10.560" style="s2">gonna</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.040" end="00:01:12.799" style="s2">buckle down and be a researcher and all</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.560" end="00:01:14.640" style="s2">of that but</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.799" end="00:01:16.240" style="s2">a few existential transformations later</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.640" end="00:01:18.240" style="s2">and i&#39;m like wait you know maybe there</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.240" end="00:01:20.799" style="s2">are more fun and playful ways to</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.240" end="00:01:22.240" style="s2">accomplish the same kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.799" end="00:01:24.240" style="s2">and along with that i think this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.240" end="00:01:25.439" style="s2">more playful mode of engagement with</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.240" end="00:01:27.600" style="s2">reality is perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.439" end="00:01:29.600" style="s2">um what we need and something that the</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.600" end="00:01:31.360" style="s2">scientific mode on its own simply can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.600" end="00:01:31.920" style="s2">give us because of the very conservative</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.360" end="00:01:34.240" style="s2">standards</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.920" end="00:01:36.720" style="s2">of um judgment and decision making that</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.240" end="00:01:40.320" style="s2">are inherent to the scientific process</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.720" end="00:01:42.000" style="s2">so i take it i mean and you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.320" end="00:01:43.920" style="s2">obviously you and i are working together</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.000" end="00:01:47.520" style="s2">but i take it that this</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.920" end="00:01:49.520" style="s2">what you want to talk about would be a</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.520" end="00:01:50.960" style="s2">significant instance of what i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.520" end="00:01:51.759" style="s2">talking about when i talk about serious</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.960" end="00:01:54.799" style="s2">play</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.759" end="00:01:56.000" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly um</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.799" end="00:01:57.200" style="s2">serious play i think that&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.000" end="00:01:58.399" style="s2">really great way that&#39;s always stood out</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.200" end="00:01:59.759" style="s2">to me as like a really good way to talk</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.399" end="00:02:03.119" style="s2">about like what&#39;s going on with</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.759" end="00:02:05.680" style="s2">um a religious uh community right</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.119" end="00:02:07.280" style="s2">there&#39;s this kind of reality this</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.680" end="00:02:09.360" style="s2">mystical spiritual reality</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.280" end="00:02:11.440" style="s2">that is concentrated in the temple or in</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.360" end="00:02:13.040" style="s2">the church and you know in heinekerian</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.440" end="00:02:14.239" style="s2">terms the purpose of the temple is to</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.040" end="00:02:17.200" style="s2">open up a world</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.239" end="00:02:18.720" style="s2">um predicated upon these uh more</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.200" end="00:02:21.599" style="s2">spiritualistic</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.720" end="00:02:22.879" style="s2">modes of experience and along line with</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.599" end="00:02:24.480" style="s2">the book that we&#39;re writing um that</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.879" end="00:02:27.840" style="s2">spiritual dimension of experiences</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.480" end="00:02:28.640" style="s2">is critical for actually um enabling an</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.840" end="00:02:30.720" style="s2">authentic</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.640" end="00:02:31.920" style="s2">dialogue with not only other people but</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.720" end="00:02:34.080" style="s2">with reality</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.920" end="00:02:35.440" style="s2">um and we can judge the efficacy of that</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.080" end="00:02:37.599" style="s2">dialogue not in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.440" end="00:02:40.080" style="s2">propositions that we generate about it</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.599" end="00:02:41.599" style="s2">but in how well we can relate to others</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.080" end="00:02:42.080" style="s2">how well we can relate to the natural</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.599" end="00:02:43.920" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.080" end="00:02:45.599" style="s2">and how sustainable that relation is</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.920" end="00:02:48.560" style="s2">over a long period of time</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.599" end="00:02:49.360" style="s2">so so the touchstone is something more</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.560" end="00:02:51.840" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.360" end="00:02:53.599" style="s2">wisdom broadly construed rather than the</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.840" end="00:02:54.879" style="s2">acquisition of sort of theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.599" end="00:02:56.879" style="s2">knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.879" end="00:02:57.920" style="s2">yes definitely and along with the wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.879" end="00:02:58.959" style="s2">stuff something that i&#39;m really trying</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.920" end="00:03:01.120" style="s2">to add um</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.959" end="00:03:02.959" style="s2">in this book is the importance of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.120" end="00:03:04.239" style="s2">idea of divine wisdom which kind of got</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.959" end="00:03:05.440" style="s2">like thrown out um</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.239" end="00:03:06.879" style="s2">which i think is kind of throwing out</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.440" end="00:03:08.080" style="s2">the baby with the bath water we got rid</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.879" end="00:03:08.800" style="s2">of the god thing and then we also</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.080" end="00:03:10.800" style="s2">thought oh</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.800" end="00:03:12.159" style="s2">this whole system&#39;s involving wisdom we</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.800" end="00:03:13.280" style="s2">can probably throw that out too</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.159" end="00:03:15.599" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s really missing from</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.280" end="00:03:17.200" style="s2">the psychological research into wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.599" end="00:03:18.560" style="s2">right um because if you look at just the</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.200" end="00:03:19.840" style="s2">individual character traits and</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.560" end="00:03:22.959" style="s2">personality traits</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.840" end="00:03:24.959" style="s2">uh things like um openness to experience</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.959" end="00:03:26.400" style="s2">or um you know grossman talks about</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.959" end="00:03:28.640" style="s2">emotional complexity being really</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.400" end="00:03:30.000" style="s2">important and making decisions wisely</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.640" end="00:03:32.480" style="s2">those kinds of things they don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.000" end="00:03:34.400" style="s2">distinguish the sage from</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.480" end="00:03:36.000" style="s2">um somebody who is perhaps a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.400" end="00:03:36.879" style="s2">more nefarious but has like really good</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.000" end="00:03:39.519" style="s2">social skills</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.879" end="00:03:40.080" style="s2">for example right right right yeah so i</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.519" end="00:03:41.680" style="s2">think this</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.080" end="00:03:43.280" style="s2">the notion of divine wisdom is really</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.680" end="00:03:45.120" style="s2">important um and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.280" end="00:03:47.040" style="s2">notion traditionally has been that there</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.120" end="00:03:49.760" style="s2">is some kind of creative force</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.040" end="00:03:51.519" style="s2">emanating into our reality um starting</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.760" end="00:03:53.680" style="s2">in god flowing through the angels</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.519" end="00:03:54.720" style="s2">and then entering into the hearts of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.680" end="00:03:56.640" style="s2">community um</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.720" end="00:03:58.159" style="s2">in christianity that&#39;s often been</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.640" end="00:03:59.439" style="s2">through the hierarchy of the church it</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.159" end="00:04:03.040" style="s2">concentrates</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.439" end="00:04:05.200" style="s2">the um the creative force of god</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.040" end="00:04:06.400" style="s2">um through that hierarchical structure</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.200" end="00:04:08.560" style="s2">and brings everybody</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.400" end="00:04:09.920" style="s2">into this sort of systems involving</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.560" end="00:04:13.200" style="s2">world involving</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.920" end="00:04:14.080" style="s2">um form of wisdom so that brings in</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.200" end="00:04:15.760" style="s2">something and</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.080" end="00:04:16.959" style="s2">you know and it&#39;s relevant to the book</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.760" end="00:04:17.840" style="s2">we&#39;re writing and it&#39;s been sort of my</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.959" end="00:04:20.160" style="s2">concern with</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.840" end="00:04:21.519" style="s2">i mean i was i was involved with igor</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.160" end="00:04:23.840" style="s2">igor grossman</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.519" end="00:04:25.440" style="s2">in uh the wisdom consensus paper and i</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.840" end="00:04:26.080" style="s2">i&#39;m how did that work i think there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.440" end="00:04:29.199" style="s2">excellent work</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.080" end="00:04:31.919" style="s2">that was done there but i do think that</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.199" end="00:04:33.199" style="s2">yeah this notion of of self</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.919" end="00:04:34.639" style="s2">transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.199" end="00:04:36.240" style="s2">and its attendant notion because i think</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.639" end="00:04:39.759" style="s2">they belong together uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.240" end="00:04:42.560" style="s2">of uh you know communitas with others</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.759" end="00:04:43.840" style="s2">it&#39;s not those are not yet finding a</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.560" end="00:04:46.000" style="s2">proper home</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.840" end="00:04:48.800" style="s2">uh within the current scientific</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.000" end="00:04:50.720" style="s2">discussion of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.800" end="00:04:52.000" style="s2">yeah i definitely agree and in order to</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.720" end="00:04:54.080" style="s2">get that um</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.000" end="00:04:56.160" style="s2">you do have to have a picture of like</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.080" end="00:04:58.800" style="s2">what the wise community looks like</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.160" end="00:04:59.440" style="s2">right and and you know for that i really</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.800" end="00:05:01.759" style="s2">like the</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.440" end="00:05:03.360" style="s2">the theory of iambicus iambicus is like</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.759" end="00:05:06.000" style="s2">the most righteous of all neoplatonists</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.360" end="00:05:07.440" style="s2">he&#39;s like a really down-to-earth guy</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.000" end="00:05:09.360" style="s2">i definitely think that&#39;s really well</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.440" end="00:05:10.720" style="s2">that&#39;s what you mean by righteous uh you</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.360" end="00:05:12.080" style="s2">have to remember daniel i&#39;m older than</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.720" end="00:05:12.560" style="s2">you so righteous carries a different</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.080" end="00:05:16.560" style="s2">meaning</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.560" end="00:05:18.000" style="s2">for me right i mean he&#39;s like super cool</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.560" end="00:05:21.199" style="s2">and he&#39;s on to some good stuff</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.000" end="00:05:23.120" style="s2">right okay go ahead so let me um</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.199" end="00:05:24.560" style="s2">let me just like flash out these uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.120" end="00:05:26.479" style="s2">projects that i want to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.560" end="00:05:28.000" style="s2">because what i really want to get out of</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.479" end="00:05:31.360" style="s2">this um</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.000" end="00:05:31.840" style="s2">interaction is twofold so on one side i</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.360" end="00:05:33.919" style="s2">want to</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.840" end="00:05:35.520" style="s2">broadcast these ideas to people because</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.919" end="00:05:37.280" style="s2">i need to start recruiting people</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.520" end="00:05:39.360" style="s2">to be doing a lot of work that i simply</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.280" end="00:05:41.520" style="s2">can&#39;t do on my own yes i need to</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.360" end="00:05:43.840" style="s2">establish the kind of wise community</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.520" end="00:05:45.919" style="s2">that i&#39;m seeking to implement</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.840" end="00:05:46.880" style="s2">and secondly i think you know it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.919" end="00:05:48.000" style="s2">a long time since we&#39;ve had a</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.880" end="00:05:49.199" style="s2">conversation and i think that you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.000" end="00:05:50.560" style="s2">have some really good input for how to</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.199" end="00:05:52.720" style="s2">effectively implement this so</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.560" end="00:05:54.000" style="s2">i also want to get a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.720" end="00:05:55.919" style="s2">insight into how to</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.000" end="00:05:59.840" style="s2">effectively carry this out from you as</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.919" end="00:06:03.600" style="s2">well that that&#39;d be great i mean i</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.840" end="00:06:04.720" style="s2">um i consider myself a dedicated novice</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.600" end="00:06:06.319" style="s2">to this project of</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.720" end="00:06:08.080" style="s2">community building i&#39;ve been engaging in</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.319" end="00:06:10.800" style="s2">it for a couple i guess</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.080" end="00:06:12.720" style="s2">close to a year and a half now um</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.800" end="00:06:14.720" style="s2">outside of university and of course</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.720" end="00:06:16.319" style="s2">i&#39;ve been engaging in it uh within the</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.720" end="00:06:17.600" style="s2">university of the cogside community for</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.319" end="00:06:19.199" style="s2">a couple of decades</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.600" end="00:06:20.880" style="s2">but that was a very special kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.199" end="00:06:22.479" style="s2">community an academic community</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.880" end="00:06:25.120" style="s2">this broader kind of community that you</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.479" end="00:06:27.600" style="s2">and i are talking about uh has of course</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.120" end="00:06:29.360" style="s2">uh unique and different features that</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.600" end="00:06:32.000" style="s2">make it especially challenging</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.360" end="00:06:33.520" style="s2">um so yeah i&#39;m happy to discuss that but</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.000" end="00:06:35.199" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s discuss the first thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.520" end="00:06:37.680" style="s2">let&#39;s discuss these projects</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.199" end="00:06:40.000" style="s2">and how they involve serious play uh the</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.680" end="00:06:42.880" style="s2">cultivation of wisdom the affording of</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.000" end="00:06:43.440" style="s2">self-transcendence and communitas so</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.880" end="00:06:46.560" style="s2">let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.440" end="00:06:49.680" style="s2">start explaining them and how they</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.560" end="00:06:50.639" style="s2">uh fulfill these functions and why they</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.680" end="00:06:53.919" style="s2">might contribute to</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.639" end="00:06:57.120" style="s2">human flourishing in some fashion sure</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.919" end="00:06:58.720" style="s2">so i&#39;ll start with the art collective</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.120" end="00:06:59.440" style="s2">side of it i think that&#39;s important for</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.720" end="00:07:01.120" style="s2">grounding it</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.440" end="00:07:02.400" style="s2">i i just have some working titles right</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.120" end="00:07:02.880" style="s2">now but i think the working titles will</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.400" end="00:07:04.800" style="s2">give you</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.880" end="00:07:07.280" style="s2">a bit of insight into where i&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.800" end="00:07:10.479" style="s2">with this so what i want to call it</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.280" end="00:07:13.599" style="s2">right now is harmonia and then subtitle</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.479" end="00:07:14.720" style="s2">and an active vision collective oh</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.599" end="00:07:17.680" style="s2">that&#39;s nice</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.720" end="00:07:19.120" style="s2">so harmonia is based on the idea um in</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.680" end="00:07:20.880" style="s2">the ancient world and in the renaissance</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.120" end="00:07:23.919" style="s2">of the harmony of the spheres</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.880" end="00:07:27.280" style="s2">right so it was generally well um</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.919" end="00:07:29.120" style="s2">well understood that music was a</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.280" end="00:07:30.639" style="s2">product of motion the vibration of</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.120" end="00:07:32.479" style="s2">strings would move the air and then that</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.639" end="00:07:34.319" style="s2">movement would initiate a musical</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.479" end="00:07:34.800" style="s2">experience upon the meeting of that</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.319" end="00:07:38.880" style="s2">movement</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.800" end="00:07:40.880" style="s2">in our sensory apparatus now</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.880" end="00:07:42.080" style="s2">the ancient thinkers also looked up at</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.880" end="00:07:42.960" style="s2">the stars and saw that they were in</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.080" end="00:07:44.720" style="s2">constant motion</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.960" end="00:07:46.479" style="s2">and they reasoned that if motion was the</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.720" end="00:07:47.039" style="s2">source of music and if the heavens were</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.479" end="00:07:49.599" style="s2">in motion</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.039" end="00:07:51.520" style="s2">then there would also be some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.599" end="00:07:54.960" style="s2">heavenly divine music</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.520" end="00:07:56.080" style="s2">which had a state of harmony a state of</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.960" end="00:07:57.520" style="s2">divine harmony</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.080" end="00:07:59.680" style="s2">everything&#39;s working in order right</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.520" end="00:08:02.639" style="s2">harmony is when things are complementary</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.680" end="00:08:04.000" style="s2">they work with each other in cohesion to</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.639" end="00:08:06.479" style="s2">create a state of beauty</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.000" end="00:08:07.840" style="s2">and a state of harmony and if you look</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.479" end="00:08:09.520" style="s2">at the</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.840" end="00:08:11.199" style="s2">function of the mystical experience</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.520" end="00:08:13.199" style="s2">according to like platinus and iamblicus</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.199" end="00:08:15.120" style="s2">and these other neoplatonists</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.199" end="00:08:17.360" style="s2">what is happening is a harmonization of</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.120" end="00:08:19.599" style="s2">the soul all of the parts of the soul</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.360" end="00:08:22.639" style="s2">are coming to operate in</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.599" end="00:08:24.560" style="s2">a harmonious unity and as a part of that</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.639" end="00:08:25.199" style="s2">harmonious unity you get the powers of</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.560" end="00:08:27.120" style="s2">agency</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.199" end="00:08:28.319" style="s2">and you also get the power of god&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.120" end="00:08:30.080" style="s2">divine providence</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.319" end="00:08:32.159" style="s2">you get to participate in the creative</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.080" end="00:08:34.320" style="s2">force of god</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.159" end="00:08:35.839" style="s2">um so that&#39;s something that i think is</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.320" end="00:08:37.519" style="s2">uh really important i think</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.839" end="00:08:39.279" style="s2">it&#39;s you could say something more of a</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.519" end="00:08:40.560" style="s2">metaphorical lens but i think that that</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.279" end="00:08:43.519" style="s2">metaphor enables</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.560" end="00:08:44.399" style="s2">a really profound relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.519" end="00:08:47.040" style="s2">reality</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.399" end="00:08:48.560" style="s2">if you understand the universe as music</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.040" end="00:08:50.880" style="s2">and harmony compared to</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.560" end="00:08:53.040" style="s2">mechanism and logic you get very</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.880" end="00:08:55.839" style="s2">different relationships out of reality</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.040" end="00:08:57.279" style="s2">so part of this art collective and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.839" end="00:09:00.320" style="s2">projects that i&#39;m going to be running</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.279" end="00:09:03.920" style="s2">with it are meant to educate people</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.320" end="00:09:05.120" style="s2">into a universe which is predicated on</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.920" end="00:09:08.240" style="s2">the metaphors of music</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.120" end="00:09:09.279" style="s2">harmony and the living being compared to</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.240" end="00:09:11.120" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.279" end="00:09:12.399" style="s2">more recent world view in which we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.120" end="00:09:14.640" style="s2">been situated in the one</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.399" end="00:09:16.000" style="s2">dominated by technology and logic and</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.640" end="00:09:17.600" style="s2">formal systems all of those kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.000" end="00:09:20.160" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.600" end="00:09:21.760" style="s2">so the inactive vision part of it um</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.160" end="00:09:22.800" style="s2">refers of course to an active cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.760" end="00:09:25.279" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.800" end="00:09:26.880" style="s2">the idea that an organism has the kind</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.279" end="00:09:30.080" style="s2">of conscious experience that it does</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.880" end="00:09:31.760" style="s2">because of how it learns to negotiate</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.080" end="00:09:32.399" style="s2">its embodied relationships with the</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.760" end="00:09:34.480" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.399" end="00:09:36.000" style="s2">right by acting in the world it carves</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.480" end="00:09:39.440" style="s2">out its conscious experience</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.000" end="00:09:40.000" style="s2">right right and so i think that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.440" end="00:09:42.000" style="s2">also been</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.000" end="00:09:43.120" style="s2">uh missing out on an important kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.000" end="00:09:44.480" style="s2">knowledge right this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.120" end="00:09:46.880" style="s2">participatory knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.480" end="00:09:47.600" style="s2">yep that you like to talk about so much</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.880" end="00:09:49.519" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.600" end="00:09:51.440" style="s2">the inactive vision i think is something</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.519" end="00:09:53.519" style="s2">like this participatory kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.440" end="00:09:56.959" style="s2">knowledge that being in a transformative</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.519" end="00:09:58.640" style="s2">space with um art and play and metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.959" end="00:10:00.800" style="s2">it will enable people not to necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.640" end="00:10:03.120" style="s2">grasp propositions but to</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.800" end="00:10:04.240" style="s2">experience the embodied vision of what</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.120" end="00:10:07.760" style="s2">it&#39;s like to inhabit</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.240" end="00:10:09.200" style="s2">a particular kind of world in order to</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.760" end="00:10:10.800" style="s2">take that world out into the world</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.200" end="00:10:11.600" style="s2">beyond which is you know exactly how</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.800" end="00:10:14.480" style="s2">you&#39;ve described</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.600" end="00:10:15.440" style="s2">uh religious practices in the past right</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.480" end="00:10:18.399" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.440" end="00:10:19.120" style="s2">um it sounds like and that would make</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.399" end="00:10:21.040" style="s2">sense to me</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.120" end="00:10:23.279" style="s2">it sounds like this is making use of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.040" end="00:10:26.320" style="s2">arguments i&#39;ve sort of drawn from</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.279" end="00:10:29.600" style="s2">l.a paul and agnes callard about</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.320" end="00:10:31.600" style="s2">you know the the aspirational project</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.600" end="00:10:33.839" style="s2">the kind of knowing that it involves a</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.600" end="00:10:35.519" style="s2">transformation of your existential modes</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.839" end="00:10:37.040" style="s2">a transformation of your participatory</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.519" end="00:10:39.120" style="s2">knowing so you</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.040" end="00:10:41.519" style="s2">it&#39;s not that you come to possess or</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.120" end="00:10:43.200" style="s2">have new propositions you come to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.519" end="00:10:45.040" style="s2">a different kind of agent in a different</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.200" end="00:10:46.640" style="s2">kind of arena is that a fair way of</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.040" end="00:10:49.360" style="s2">putting it yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.640" end="00:10:50.800" style="s2">absolutely um radical arena</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.360" end="00:10:52.240" style="s2">transformation is precisely the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.800" end="00:10:54.079" style="s2">thing i&#39;m going for</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.240" end="00:10:56.160" style="s2">so it would be also therefore radical</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.079" end="00:10:59.279" style="s2">agency transformation too wouldn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.160" end="00:11:02.240" style="s2">uh yes yes yes yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.279" end="00:11:04.320" style="s2">and so that would also be so i i i mean</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.240" end="00:11:07.760" style="s2">this sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.320" end="00:11:10.560" style="s2">uh a way of really uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.760" end="00:11:12.160" style="s2">doing a couple of things deepening the</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.560" end="00:11:14.720" style="s2">sense of the being mode and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.160" end="00:11:18.399" style="s2">developmental aspiration they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.720" end="00:11:21.120" style="s2">uh but it also affords people</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.399" end="00:11:22.399" style="s2">playing in this alternative reality if</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.120" end="00:11:24.560" style="s2">i&#39;ll put it that way or</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.399" end="00:11:26.240" style="s2">augment it i sometimes call it the trans</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.560" end="00:11:29.440" style="s2">world where i&#39;m using</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.240" end="00:11:31.120" style="s2">a token&#39;s notion of fantasy not as an uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.440" end="00:11:32.480" style="s2">an escapist other world but as a</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.120" end="00:11:33.200" style="s2">different way of returning and seeing</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.480" end="00:11:36.320" style="s2">this world</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.200" end="00:11:40.000" style="s2">or something like that but the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.320" end="00:11:42.079" style="s2">a serious play is um that it allows you</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.000" end="00:11:43.839" style="s2">to get a participatory and perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.079" end="00:11:46.560" style="s2">taste of that other</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.839" end="00:11:47.680" style="s2">world without having gone over into a</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.560" end="00:11:49.440" style="s2">full-blown</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.680" end="00:11:52.000" style="s2">sort of abandonment of everything that</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.440" end="00:11:55.200" style="s2">you have here is that is that the idea</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.000" end="00:11:56.160" style="s2">yeah yeah absolutely and i&#39;ll clarify</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.200" end="00:11:58.079" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.160" end="00:11:59.760" style="s2">the project that is going to carry this</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.079" end="00:12:00.480" style="s2">out in a moment but i also wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.760" end="00:12:02.160" style="s2">mention this thing about the</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.480" end="00:12:03.680" style="s2">transformative experience paradox right</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.160" end="00:12:05.440" style="s2">which i&#39;m sure people who listen to this</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.680" end="00:12:07.440" style="s2">are very familiar with the problem that</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.440" end="00:12:09.200" style="s2">wow how do i become that other person</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.440" end="00:12:10.720" style="s2">that i am not because my preferences are</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.200" end="00:12:11.839" style="s2">not even those person&#39;s preferences i</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.720" end="00:12:12.800" style="s2">don&#39;t even know how to relate to that</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.839" end="00:12:15.040" style="s2">future character</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.800" end="00:12:16.800" style="s2">right exactly so that problem has been</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.040" end="00:12:18.959" style="s2">solved in the past by having a</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.800" end="00:12:20.880" style="s2">community of people who are sustaining a</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.959" end="00:12:21.920" style="s2">vision of life that you can then bind</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.880" end="00:12:24.160" style="s2">yourself to</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.920" end="00:12:25.519" style="s2">yes yes right the buddhist community the</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.160" end="00:12:26.240" style="s2">christian community those are places</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.519" end="00:12:29.360" style="s2">that you can go</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.240" end="00:12:30.560" style="s2">to find the answer to who that you you</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.360" end="00:12:33.600" style="s2">should become</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.560" end="00:12:35.920" style="s2">actually is and what that looks like so</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.600" end="00:12:36.959" style="s2">within our culture we actually i think</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.920" end="00:12:39.680" style="s2">need to have</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.959" end="00:12:41.440" style="s2">some kind of space some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.680" end="00:12:43.200" style="s2">situational arena</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.440" end="00:12:45.360" style="s2">that solves the problem of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.200" end="00:12:47.760" style="s2">transformative experience paradox</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.360" end="00:12:49.279" style="s2">for people we have to have that answer</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.760" end="00:12:51.600" style="s2">available so that when people</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.279" end="00:12:52.320" style="s2">experience deep dissatisfaction and they</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.600" end="00:12:54.320" style="s2">feel that</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.320" end="00:12:56.160" style="s2">call to go on what might be called the</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.320" end="00:12:58.240" style="s2">enlightenment journey by diving into</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.160" end="00:13:00.399" style="s2">transformative states of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.240" end="00:13:02.880" style="s2">trying to become wise trying to become</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.399" end="00:13:05.360" style="s2">satisfied to overcome suffering</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.880" end="00:13:06.079" style="s2">that&#39;s an impossible task or at least a</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.360" end="00:13:08.160" style="s2">near impossible</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.079" end="00:13:10.800" style="s2">task to do on your own and you know the</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.160" end="00:13:13.040" style="s2">theravadan buddhists they</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.800" end="00:13:14.880" style="s2">would claim for example that the only</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.040" end="00:13:15.920" style="s2">true buddha is the one who initiates</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.880" end="00:13:18.160" style="s2">this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.920" end="00:13:19.680" style="s2">novel practice this kind of novel way of</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.160" end="00:13:22.320" style="s2">life which is a really</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.680" end="00:13:24.079" style="s2">tall order to expect of anybody i think</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.320" end="00:13:25.839" style="s2">it is like a wise thing to say well you</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.079" end="00:13:27.440" style="s2">know we have people who can</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.839" end="00:13:28.959" style="s2">set this vision for life and then we</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.440" end="00:13:31.760" style="s2">have a community of practice</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.959" end="00:13:33.200" style="s2">who binds themselves to this vision it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.760" end="00:13:35.440" style="s2">like a distributed</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.200" end="00:13:38.480" style="s2">computation uh solution to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.440" end="00:13:42.320" style="s2">transformative experience problem</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.480" end="00:13:44.240" style="s2">so so uh i mean uh one</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.320" end="00:13:45.680" style="s2">answer that i sometimes get when i talk</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.240" end="00:13:47.040" style="s2">about this with people is they say well</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.680" end="00:13:49.120" style="s2">we already have</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.040" end="00:13:50.959" style="s2">i don&#39;t know we already have sort of a a</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.120" end="00:13:52.880" style="s2">socially uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.959" end="00:13:54.959" style="s2">acceptable way in which people go and</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.880" end="00:13:56.720" style="s2">experience this kind of serious play</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.959" end="00:13:58.480" style="s2">to engage in this kind of transformation</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.720" end="00:13:58.720" style="s2">it&#39;s called therapy and people go and</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.480" end="00:14:01.199" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.720" end="00:14:03.040" style="s2">therapists and how they undergo so are</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.199" end="00:14:03.519" style="s2">you just proposing i know you&#39;re not so</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.040" end="00:14:05.120" style="s2">this is</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.519" end="00:14:06.800" style="s2">a bit of a softball question but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.120" end="00:14:08.320" style="s2">it&#39;s an invitation question you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.800" end="00:14:10.160" style="s2">just proposing some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.320" end="00:14:11.440" style="s2">art therapy you&#39;re proposing something</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.160" end="00:14:13.760" style="s2">greater than that right</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.440" end="00:14:15.760" style="s2">something far greater than that because</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.760" end="00:14:16.880" style="s2">therapy is highly individualistic and</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.760" end="00:14:19.360" style="s2">all that it can do</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.880" end="00:14:20.000" style="s2">is bind you to the way that things are</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.360" end="00:14:22.000" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.000" end="00:14:23.440" style="s2">but the way that things are now are</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.000" end="00:14:26.480" style="s2">instrumental in</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.440" end="00:14:28.240" style="s2">everybody&#39;s suffering um the quote</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.480" end="00:14:29.760" style="s2">that&#39;s always stuck with me from like</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.240" end="00:14:31.680" style="s2">my early days as a psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.760" end="00:14:32.240" style="s2">enthusiast is the quote by krishnamurti</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.680" end="00:14:33.839" style="s2">which goes</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.240" end="00:14:36.160" style="s2">it&#39;s no measure of health to be well</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.839" end="00:14:37.920" style="s2">adjusted to a profoundly sick society</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.160" end="00:14:39.600" style="s2">right right and i think therapy is great</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.920" end="00:14:41.760" style="s2">and i think that psychedelic therapy is</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.600" end="00:14:43.839" style="s2">also an amazing and wonderful thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.760" end="00:14:44.800" style="s2">but we have to look at transformative</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.839" end="00:14:48.160" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.800" end="00:14:50.000" style="s2">and the project of wisdom aspiration</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.160" end="00:14:52.720" style="s2">in a way that i think parallels how we</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.000" end="00:14:55.760" style="s2">can talk about drug policy for example</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.720" end="00:14:55.760" style="s2">you can have um</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.839" end="00:14:58.720" style="s2">there&#39;s a number of different strategies</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.279" end="00:15:00.480" style="s2">you can have you can have a harm</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.720" end="00:15:02.800" style="s2">reduction strategy for example</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.480" end="00:15:04.480" style="s2">which seeks to simply remove the harms</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.800" end="00:15:06.160" style="s2">from drug use</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.480" end="00:15:07.920" style="s2">or you can have a benefit maximization</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.160" end="00:15:10.000" style="s2">strategy which recognizes that things</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.920" end="00:15:13.440" style="s2">like psychedelics or other substances</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.000" end="00:15:17.040" style="s2">are radically profound and powerful</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.440" end="00:15:18.800" style="s2">and then looks to</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.040" end="00:15:20.399" style="s2">integrate those kinds of things into our</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.800" end="00:15:21.199" style="s2">culture in a way that maximizes the</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.399" end="00:15:24.160" style="s2">benefits</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.199" end="00:15:25.279" style="s2">safely and rationally and so i think</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.160" end="00:15:27.839" style="s2">that thing kind of goes</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.279" end="00:15:29.120" style="s2">also just for transformations of self</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.839" end="00:15:29.759" style="s2">and transformations of consciousness in</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.120" end="00:15:32.639" style="s2">general</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.759" end="00:15:33.519" style="s2">and i very much see one-on-one therapy</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.639" end="00:15:35.759" style="s2">as something that</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.519" end="00:15:38.160" style="s2">is just incapable of maximizing the</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.759" end="00:15:40.160" style="s2">benefits of transformative experience</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.160" end="00:15:41.920" style="s2">compared to something that is more</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.160" end="00:15:42.480" style="s2">culturally relevant and culturally</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.920" end="00:15:43.759" style="s2">active</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.480" end="00:15:45.519" style="s2">which is why i think that an art</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.759" end="00:15:47.440" style="s2">collective is necessary because we need</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.519" end="00:15:49.680" style="s2">to start informing the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.440" end="00:15:52.880" style="s2">structures at play in our reality</p>

<p begin="00:16:30.399" end="00:16:34.320" style="s2">alluding to this book and you have no no</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.320" end="00:16:35.600" style="s2">no idea what we&#39;re talking about but now</p>

<p begin="00:16:35.600" end="00:16:38.959" style="s2">the more specific you know proposals</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.399" end="00:16:42.560" style="s2">that you have</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.959" end="00:16:45.199" style="s2">so please okay so</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.560" end="00:16:47.040" style="s2">here&#39;s here&#39;s what i think the religion</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.199" end="00:16:48.839" style="s2">that&#39;s not a religion</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.040" end="00:16:50.320" style="s2">requires i think this is a necessary</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.839" end="00:16:53.600" style="s2">element</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.320" end="00:16:55.279" style="s2">so for a while i had been trying to plan</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.600" end="00:16:56.959" style="s2">this project trying to conceive of it</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.279" end="00:16:58.480" style="s2">um and i&#39;ve been thinking in like very</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.959" end="00:17:00.079" style="s2">serious terms you know like we have to</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.480" end="00:17:01.440" style="s2">have like a building and it has to like</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.079" end="00:17:02.800" style="s2">have meditation teachers and we have to</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.440" end="00:17:04.480" style="s2">like teach people philosophy and all of</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.800" end="00:17:06.880" style="s2">this stuff but then</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.480" end="00:17:08.079" style="s2">i was i was talking to someone um i know</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.880" end="00:17:10.400" style="s2">you&#39;ve been on their podcast</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.079" end="00:17:11.439" style="s2">tim from from voice club oh tim edelman</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.400" end="00:17:12.799" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.439" end="00:17:14.880" style="s2">i was having a conversation with him and</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.799" end="00:17:16.480" style="s2">he was like questioning me about well</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.880" end="00:17:18.240" style="s2">is this kind of thing like very viable</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.480" end="00:17:19.760" style="s2">if we need social distancing measures</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.240" end="00:17:21.839" style="s2">and just that was enough to like click</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.760" end="00:17:25.679" style="s2">in my head i was like holy crap</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.839" end="00:17:28.319" style="s2">i could make this a game i could make</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.679" end="00:17:30.480" style="s2">an online run alternate reality game</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.319" end="00:17:33.280" style="s2">that has occasional in-person activities</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.480" end="00:17:35.039" style="s2">but it has resiliency um against you</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.280" end="00:17:36.799" style="s2">know perhaps a second wave of covet or</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.039" end="00:17:40.000" style="s2">some other future issue that might</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.799" end="00:17:42.160" style="s2">emerge however long down the road um</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.000" end="00:17:43.280" style="s2">to run this as kind of a decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.160" end="00:17:45.120" style="s2">platform</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.280" end="00:17:47.440" style="s2">and so as i got thinking about how i</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.120" end="00:17:48.320" style="s2">could run that i came up with the idea</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.440" end="00:17:51.440" style="s2">for the great</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.320" end="00:17:52.400" style="s2">awakening and so the great awakening is</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.440" end="00:17:54.880" style="s2">the name of this game</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.400" end="00:17:56.559" style="s2">um i think it&#39;s very culturally apropos</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.880" end="00:17:59.679" style="s2">because that&#39;s the hashtag that you see</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.559" end="00:18:00.080" style="s2">always um on this q a narrative stuff</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.679" end="00:18:02.799" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.080" end="00:18:04.799" style="s2">this very interesting and intricate kind</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.799" end="00:18:06.080" style="s2">of psycho-spiritual warfare that people</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.799" end="00:18:08.080" style="s2">are engaged with</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.080" end="00:18:09.520" style="s2">you know the deep state against</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.080" end="00:18:10.720" style="s2">everybody else</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.520" end="00:18:13.520" style="s2">it&#39;s a bizarre thing we can start</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.720" end="00:18:14.960" style="s2">talking about it but i think that</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.520" end="00:18:16.880" style="s2">the way that people make meaning is</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.960" end="00:18:19.520" style="s2">already you know as you say it&#39;s like an</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.880" end="00:18:20.640" style="s2">agent arena relationship thing going on</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.520" end="00:18:22.000" style="s2">i think that we can articulate</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.640" end="00:18:25.120" style="s2">consciousness in general</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.000" end="00:18:26.080" style="s2">as a process of augmented reality game</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.120" end="00:18:27.280" style="s2">generation</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.080" end="00:18:28.640" style="s2">and then if we did something like that</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.280" end="00:18:30.080" style="s2">we&#39;d probably all be a little bit better</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.640" end="00:18:31.360" style="s2">off because we&#39;re all just playing games</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.080" end="00:18:32.799" style="s2">at the end of the day</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.360" end="00:18:34.559" style="s2">how seriously we take those games</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.799" end="00:18:37.919" style="s2">depends on the parameters of the game</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.559" end="00:18:39.600" style="s2">and the games that we make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.919" end="00:18:41.120" style="s2">determine our action they determine our</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.600" end="00:18:42.880" style="s2">relationship to the world</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.120" end="00:18:44.559" style="s2">so in the question of what is the best</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.880" end="00:18:46.320" style="s2">game that we can play i thought that we</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.559" end="00:18:49.440" style="s2">probably need to really</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.320" end="00:18:50.960" style="s2">clearly get some alternative game out</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.440" end="00:18:53.039" style="s2">there that can</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.960" end="00:18:54.160" style="s2">interface with people&#39;s meaning making</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.039" end="00:18:56.799" style="s2">powers</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.160" end="00:18:58.720" style="s2">and to draw them out of this descent</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.799" end="00:19:01.840" style="s2">into self-deception and foolishness</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.720" end="00:19:03.840" style="s2">and and bind them to um a cultural hyper</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.840" end="00:19:07.200" style="s2">object that is in their better interest</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.840" end="00:19:10.480" style="s2">right right so the</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.200" end="00:19:13.760" style="s2">so can i ask a question so yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.480" end="00:19:15.840" style="s2">that this game is not meant to exclude</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.760" end="00:19:18.240" style="s2">people undertaking the task of training</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.840" end="00:19:19.760" style="s2">skills of mindfulness or rationality</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.240" end="00:19:21.679" style="s2">or anything like that that&#39;s not what</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.760" end="00:19:24.080" style="s2">because what you might what you said</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.679" end="00:19:25.919" style="s2">might have been taken to convey that no</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.080" end="00:19:27.440" style="s2">actually that stuff is a part of it</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.919" end="00:19:29.360" style="s2">right right so let me lay out what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.440" end="00:19:31.280" style="s2">going to look like so</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.360" end="00:19:33.039" style="s2">basically it&#39;s a live-action role-play</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.280" end="00:19:36.160" style="s2">secret society simulator</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.039" end="00:19:38.640" style="s2">right okay larps yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.160" end="00:19:40.160" style="s2">and so what happens is you um you</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.640" end="00:19:42.480" style="s2">actually let me start with the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.160" end="00:19:43.600" style="s2">cosmic narrative in which it&#39;s situated</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.480" end="00:19:45.919" style="s2">right okay</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.600" end="00:19:48.080" style="s2">so there&#39;s a god his name is anthem he</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.919" end="00:19:50.000" style="s2">is the god of stories and time</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.080" end="00:19:51.679" style="s2">because that is the his name is a play</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.000" end="00:19:52.960" style="s2">on the structure of stories and then and</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.679" end="00:19:55.360" style="s2">then and then and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.960" end="00:19:57.039" style="s2">right right and and so this is one of</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.360" end="00:19:59.200" style="s2">the the primordial old gods</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.039" end="00:20:01.200" style="s2">so if we think back to like uh hp</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.200" end="00:20:03.039" style="s2">lovecraft&#39;s cosmos he has like the</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.200" end="00:20:04.880" style="s2">um you know the outer ones who are like</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.039" end="00:20:07.280" style="s2">massive forces of chaos and</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.880" end="00:20:10.799" style="s2">incomprehensible cosmic power</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.280" end="00:20:13.200" style="s2">and and then is one of those but</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.799" end="00:20:14.240" style="s2">because it&#39;s so fundamental to change</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.200" end="00:20:16.240" style="s2">into time</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.240" end="00:20:17.760" style="s2">and then permeates everything and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.240" end="00:20:19.919" style="s2">he&#39;s a force that can become</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.760" end="00:20:20.880" style="s2">personal and can address us as an</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.919" end="00:20:23.120" style="s2">individual</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.880" end="00:20:24.480" style="s2">right okay and especially because human</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.120" end="00:20:26.159" style="s2">beings we have such a</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.480" end="00:20:27.919" style="s2">profound capacity for storytelling and</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.159" end="00:20:29.520" style="s2">for story generation and then is</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.919" end="00:20:32.159" style="s2">particularly close with us</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.520" end="00:20:34.159" style="s2">because we kind of maximize that latent</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.159" end="00:20:35.679" style="s2">power for creation within the and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.159" end="00:20:38.080" style="s2">structure of reality</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.679" end="00:20:39.280" style="s2">right right right so and that is very</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.080" end="00:20:40.720" style="s2">deeply concerned</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.280" end="00:20:42.320" style="s2">about the narrative structures that are</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.720" end="00:20:45.200" style="s2">at play in our reality</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.320" end="00:20:46.640" style="s2">and building on um federico campania&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.200" end="00:20:49.039" style="s2">technique and magic i&#39;m calling</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.640" end="00:20:51.039" style="s2">the deity that governs the current</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.039" end="00:20:53.360" style="s2">narrative structure is technic</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.039" end="00:20:55.120" style="s2">right right so technic he likes</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.360" end="00:20:56.559" style="s2">production and he likes capital</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.120" end="00:20:58.240" style="s2">accumulation</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.559" end="00:21:00.240" style="s2">he tries to reduce everything into a</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.240" end="00:21:01.679" style="s2">productive analytical series</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.240" end="00:21:03.120" style="s2">formal systems are the only things that</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.679" end="00:21:04.559" style="s2">are allowed to exist in that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.120" end="00:21:06.400" style="s2">reality system</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.559" end="00:21:07.679" style="s2">and the necessary end of that is our</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.400" end="00:21:10.159" style="s2">annihilation the</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.679" end="00:21:10.720" style="s2">incorporation of everything into this</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.159" end="00:21:13.840" style="s2">flat</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.720" end="00:21:16.240" style="s2">ontology of serial production</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.840" end="00:21:17.679" style="s2">right right right so and that is</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.240" end="00:21:19.360" style="s2">concerned because he doesn&#39;t want us to</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.679" end="00:21:20.159" style="s2">die he&#39;s very fond of us because we can</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.360" end="00:21:22.159" style="s2">like give him</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.159" end="00:21:24.400" style="s2">greater and more interesting things to</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.159" end="00:21:26.400" style="s2">do and so what he does is he</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.400" end="00:21:28.720" style="s2">sets up a secret society called the</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.400" end="00:21:31.840" style="s2">academy for existential excellence</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.720" end="00:21:35.360" style="s2">and his task is to</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.840" end="00:21:37.200" style="s2">incorporate people into a</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.360" end="00:21:38.480" style="s2">a new way of being a new kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.200" end="00:21:39.840" style="s2">narrative structure that can then</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.480" end="00:21:42.720" style="s2">replace and topple</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.840" end="00:21:44.640" style="s2">uh the old one uh governed by technic</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.720" end="00:21:46.880" style="s2">which is leading to our demise</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.640" end="00:21:48.960" style="s2">and so as a part of the existential x um</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.880" end="00:21:50.960" style="s2">the economy for existential excellence</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.960" end="00:21:52.159" style="s2">um it&#39;ll be about a three-month journey</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.960" end="00:21:52.720" style="s2">and in the first month you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.159" end="00:21:55.840" style="s2">mostly</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.720" end="00:21:58.640" style="s2">um coursework and wisdom-based practices</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.840" end="00:21:59.919" style="s2">um so you know meditation um we could do</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.640" end="00:22:01.679" style="s2">horses and logic</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.919" end="00:22:02.960" style="s2">um i&#39;m getting alex jetovic who just</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.679" end="00:22:06.080" style="s2">finished his phd</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.960" end="00:22:08.000" style="s2">uh to do a course on uh natural agency</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.080" end="00:22:09.760" style="s2">and the metaphor of the living being</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.000" end="00:22:11.760" style="s2">right right as like a better way to</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.760" end="00:22:13.360" style="s2">understand evolution and agency</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.760" end="00:22:15.120" style="s2">so there&#39;ll be some good rigorous cog</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.360" end="00:22:16.960" style="s2">sci stuff in there but it&#39;ll all be</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.120" end="00:22:18.640" style="s2">embedded within this playful narrative</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.960" end="00:22:20.400" style="s2">um which will also have some</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.640" end="00:22:22.400" style="s2">kind of semi-fictional content that&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.400" end="00:22:24.000" style="s2">be entertaining and educate you into the</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.400" end="00:22:24.960" style="s2">history and the story of this particular</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.000" end="00:22:28.240" style="s2">narrative</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.960" end="00:22:30.320" style="s2">right and after that first month and a</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.240" end="00:22:32.240" style="s2">half though things start to get weird</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.320" end="00:22:34.000" style="s2">because the alternate reality that and</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.240" end="00:22:36.960" style="s2">then is trying to get us to</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.000" end="00:22:38.080" style="s2">move towards is starting to phase into</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.960" end="00:22:39.919" style="s2">our reality</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.080" end="00:22:42.400" style="s2">the members of the academy are called</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.919" end="00:22:44.080" style="s2">synthesis i really like synthesizers as</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.400" end="00:22:46.240" style="s2">a metaphor for consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.080" end="00:22:48.320" style="s2">um the synthesizer is like your basic</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.240" end="00:22:49.440" style="s2">dynamical system it has like a space of</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.320" end="00:22:51.440" style="s2">all possible sound</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.440" end="00:22:53.120" style="s2">and then with different um oscillators</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.440" end="00:22:55.520" style="s2">and um effects</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.120" end="00:22:56.799" style="s2">you like change it so that it has a</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.520" end="00:22:58.159" style="s2">different kind of outcome</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.799" end="00:22:59.280" style="s2">right so i think that the individual</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.159" end="00:23:00.960" style="s2">consciousness is kind of like a</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.280" end="00:23:02.960" style="s2">synthesizer in that respect we can like</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.960" end="00:23:05.440" style="s2">apply these warps and oscillations to it</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.960" end="00:23:07.200" style="s2">to like change the output</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.440" end="00:23:09.280" style="s2">and so you learn the skills of synthesis</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.200" end="00:23:10.799" style="s2">which is basically a skill of like magic</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.280" end="00:23:13.919" style="s2">and channeling and the point</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.799" end="00:23:16.159" style="s2">um of this educational system is to have</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.919" end="00:23:17.200" style="s2">a whole set of minds synthesizing new</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.159" end="00:23:20.559" style="s2">beings and new</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.200" end="00:23:21.360" style="s2">cultural entities into reality and so as</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.559" end="00:23:23.280" style="s2">a part of that</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.360" end="00:23:24.960" style="s2">once enough power has been built built</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.280" end="00:23:26.240" style="s2">up by people doing these practices and</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.960" end="00:23:27.600" style="s2">congregating and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.240" end="00:23:29.679" style="s2">you know performing some ritualistic</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.600" end="00:23:31.360" style="s2">acts etc um</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.679" end="00:23:32.960" style="s2">then then it gets interesting because</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.360" end="00:23:33.919" style="s2">that alternate timeline that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.960" end="00:23:35.600" style="s2">trying to</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.919" end="00:23:37.600" style="s2">coordinate ourselves with starts phasing</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.600" end="00:23:40.000" style="s2">into reality so there&#39;s a number of</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.600" end="00:23:41.120" style="s2">immersive theater shows which will allow</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.000" end="00:23:42.640" style="s2">people to go and visit</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.120" end="00:23:44.799" style="s2">and participate in this alternate</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.640" end="00:23:46.559" style="s2">reality that we could have been living</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.799" end="00:23:48.480" style="s2">in now if only we had done things</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.559" end="00:23:51.919" style="s2">differently a few hundred years ago</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.480" end="00:23:54.159" style="s2">but that we can match ourselves up with</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.919" end="00:23:56.080" style="s2">down the road if only we engage in this</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.159" end="00:23:57.840" style="s2">process of synthesis effectively</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.080" end="00:23:59.279" style="s2">right and at the end there will be this</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.840" end="00:24:02.000" style="s2">grand ritual</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.279" end="00:24:04.000" style="s2">initiation um i have an art collective</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.000" end="00:24:04.880" style="s2">called komatica they&#39;re from the uk um</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.000" end="00:24:06.480" style="s2">they&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.880" end="00:24:08.720" style="s2">networked with the imperial college</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.480" end="00:24:11.520" style="s2">people uh researching psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.720" end="00:24:12.240" style="s2">to build um transformative profoundly</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.520" end="00:24:14.720" style="s2">altering</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.240" end="00:24:15.360" style="s2">um ritualistic performance experiences</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.720" end="00:24:16.720" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.360" end="00:24:18.480" style="s2">so i&#39;ve been talking to them about</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.720" end="00:24:19.760" style="s2">having some kind of grand initiation at</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.480" end="00:24:21.520" style="s2">the end which will then</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.760" end="00:24:23.679" style="s2">make you sort of a permanent member of</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.520" end="00:24:25.520" style="s2">this community of the academy</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.679" end="00:24:26.720" style="s2">that&#39;s cool that&#39;s what so it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.520" end="00:24:29.200" style="s2">like something like</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.720" end="00:24:30.799" style="s2">the eleusian mysteries at the end that</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.200" end="00:24:33.039" style="s2">they had in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.799" end="00:24:34.400" style="s2">hellenic culture yeah yeah it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.039" end="00:24:35.279" style="s2">very mystery school vibe there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.400" end="00:24:36.559" style="s2">number of um</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.279" end="00:24:38.880" style="s2">you know secrets that have to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.559" end="00:24:41.039" style="s2">initiated in lots of symbols that&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.880" end="00:24:44.159" style="s2">primed throughout the experience that</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.039" end="00:24:48.000" style="s2">um will take a central role in that</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.159" end="00:24:50.799" style="s2">uh final ritual culmination</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.000" end="00:24:51.600" style="s2">so what can there&#39;s lots of practical</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.799" end="00:24:53.440" style="s2">questions but</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.600" end="00:24:56.080" style="s2">maybe a more high-level question first</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.440" end="00:24:59.200" style="s2">what connection is there between</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.080" end="00:25:02.480" style="s2">um the game and</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.200" end="00:25:04.000" style="s2">um and what you&#39;re calling the art</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.480" end="00:25:05.520" style="s2">collective like what&#39;s that what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.000" end="00:25:07.520" style="s2">relationship there</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.520" end="00:25:10.159" style="s2">so the art collective is the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.520" end="00:25:12.880" style="s2">is going to implement and build the game</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.159" end="00:25:13.760" style="s2">i see i see it&#39;s also going to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.880" end="00:25:16.880" style="s2">something that</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.760" end="00:25:17.919" style="s2">i take at homes the final stage of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.880" end="00:25:21.120" style="s2">initiation</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.919" end="00:25:22.480" style="s2">sort of practice that um is</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.120" end="00:25:24.880" style="s2">is that is that is that like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.480" end="00:25:26.159" style="s2">going to help uh create that space in</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.880" end="00:25:28.159" style="s2">which that occurs</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.159" end="00:25:29.520" style="s2">yeah yeah absolutely so you know i need</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.159" end="00:25:30.880" style="s2">to establish an art collective because i</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.520" end="00:25:33.039" style="s2">need a number of people with like</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.880" end="00:25:34.880" style="s2">skills um i need people for doing like</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.039" end="00:25:36.559" style="s2">set design and stage design</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.880" end="00:25:38.640" style="s2">uh i need people to help me produce</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.559" end="00:25:39.440" style="s2">video content for the online courses and</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.640" end="00:25:41.760" style="s2">all of this</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.440" end="00:25:43.360" style="s2">um so the the collective will be the</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.760" end="00:25:45.120" style="s2">community of people that are responsible</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.360" end="00:25:46.640" style="s2">for constructing and building and then</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.120" end="00:25:48.960" style="s2">carrying out the game</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.640" end="00:25:50.799" style="s2">you&#39;re also i guess going to need people</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.960" end="00:25:52.480" style="s2">who are good at programming</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.799" end="00:25:54.480" style="s2">and video game production and things</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.480" end="00:25:56.799" style="s2">like that as well um well there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.480" end="00:25:58.159" style="s2">going to be really much on the</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.799" end="00:26:00.400" style="s2">you know it&#39;s an alternate reality game</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.159" end="00:26:03.360" style="s2">but that doesn&#39;t mean that there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.400" end="00:26:04.240" style="s2">virtual reality stuff necessarily um</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.360" end="00:26:07.120" style="s2">it&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.240" end="00:26:07.679" style="s2">kind of like a live action role play um</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.120" end="00:26:10.320" style="s2">so so</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.679" end="00:26:11.679" style="s2">yeah right right right okay so most of</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.320" end="00:26:14.559" style="s2">it is taking place</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.679" end="00:26:15.200" style="s2">in sort of the imaginal space a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.559" end="00:26:16.320" style="s2">it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.200" end="00:26:17.679" style="s2">and then there will be um there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.320" end="00:26:19.039" style="s2">an online platform called mighty</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.679" end="00:26:20.720" style="s2">networks that i want to run it off it</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.039" end="00:26:21.200" style="s2">allows you to have a social network that</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.720" end="00:26:23.279" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.200" end="00:26:24.480" style="s2">allows you to run courses off of so</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.279" end="00:26:25.520" style="s2">that&#39;s the online platform that i want</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.480" end="00:26:27.760" style="s2">to use and then it&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.520" end="00:26:29.279" style="s2">you know you go on coursera you find um</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.760" end="00:26:30.000" style="s2">online courses it&#39;ll look very similar</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.279" end="00:26:31.760" style="s2">to that</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.000" end="00:26:34.880" style="s2">but it&#39;ll all be sort of networked in</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.760" end="00:26:38.320" style="s2">with this larger narrative structure</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.880" end="00:26:41.279" style="s2">right and so the goal is that</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.320" end="00:26:42.080" style="s2">people will come out of this in</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.279" end="00:26:43.840" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.080" end="00:26:46.320" style="s2">something analogous to having belonged</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.840" end="00:26:48.240" style="s2">to a church or to a temple</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.320" end="00:26:49.919" style="s2">or something like that or a mosque for</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.240" end="00:26:53.120" style="s2">an extended period of time</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.919" end="00:26:56.320" style="s2">yeah yeah exactly that&#39;s cool</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.120" end="00:26:59.520" style="s2">and and who&#39;s gonna like moderate it</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.320" end="00:27:01.360" style="s2">uh because i can i can also imagine</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.520" end="00:27:03.200" style="s2">that this kind of game will attract</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.360" end="00:27:05.520" style="s2">attention from</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.200" end="00:27:06.720" style="s2">uh bad faith players who don&#39;t want it</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.520" end="00:27:09.919" style="s2">to succeed</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.720" end="00:27:12.240" style="s2">um for various nefarious reasons</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.919" end="00:27:14.559" style="s2">right that is possible there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.240" end="00:27:16.559" style="s2">logistical things that i i need to</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.559" end="00:27:17.919" style="s2">work out and that is for sure right now</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.559" end="00:27:19.279" style="s2">i&#39;m very much in the in the phase of</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.919" end="00:27:21.200" style="s2">like idea generation and story</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.279" end="00:27:22.480" style="s2">generations i&#39;ve been focusing mostly on</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.200" end="00:27:25.120" style="s2">on world building</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.480" end="00:27:26.960" style="s2">right um for moderation the the</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.120" end="00:27:27.520" style="s2">particular theater shows that i&#39;ve come</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.960" end="00:27:28.559" style="s2">up with</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.520" end="00:27:30.080" style="s2">which i don&#39;t want to share because you</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.559" end="00:27:31.120" style="s2">know spoilers would kind of ruin the</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.080" end="00:27:33.919" style="s2">effect of the game</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.120" end="00:27:35.520" style="s2">right um i have ways of incorporating</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.919" end="00:27:38.640" style="s2">people who are like part of the game</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.520" end="00:27:40.399" style="s2">uh as sort of in situation</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.640" end="00:27:42.480" style="s2">moderators to kind of control moments</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.399" end="00:27:44.559" style="s2">like that right</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.480" end="00:27:46.320" style="s2">so like i said so this is very much the</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.559" end="00:27:48.960" style="s2">live action the larping</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.320" end="00:27:49.840" style="s2">right um so are you after are you after</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.960" end="00:27:51.440" style="s2">something like</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.840" end="00:27:53.279" style="s2">uh what happens in jeep form are you</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.440" end="00:27:56.559" style="s2">after the bleed phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.279" end="00:27:57.600" style="s2">where the line between the play</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.559" end="00:28:00.320" style="s2">environment and</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.600" end="00:28:01.520" style="s2">and the everyday world bleeds and you</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.320" end="00:28:03.120" style="s2">start to get a transformative</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.520" end="00:28:05.039" style="s2">relationship between them is that</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.120" end="00:28:06.480" style="s2">is bleed sort of the goal that is being</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.039" end="00:28:10.000" style="s2">saw yes</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.480" end="00:28:12.000" style="s2">absolutely while it is situated in a</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.000" end="00:28:15.360" style="s2">playful context i do think that</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.000" end="00:28:17.520" style="s2">the metaphor of life and music</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.360" end="00:28:18.960" style="s2">are much better ways for modeling</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.520" end="00:28:20.240" style="s2">reality especially if we&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.960" end="00:28:23.039" style="s2">how we develop the right kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.240" end="00:28:24.960" style="s2">participatory relationships with reality</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.039" end="00:28:26.559" style="s2">so i think that you know not only are</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.960" end="00:28:28.240" style="s2">they this is is this the optimal</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.559" end="00:28:29.440" style="s2">framework in terms of it promoting the</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.240" end="00:28:30.080" style="s2">best kind of relationship i also think</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.440" end="00:28:33.039" style="s2">that it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.080" end="00:28:34.240" style="s2">a lot more true than a strictly</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.039" end="00:28:35.760" style="s2">mechanistic view</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.240" end="00:28:37.760" style="s2">and so you can look at like for example</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.760" end="00:28:39.919" style="s2">the work of dennis walsh and lee smallin</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.760" end="00:28:42.080" style="s2">roberto unger</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.919" end="00:28:44.240" style="s2">there&#39;s numerous people coming out now</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.080" end="00:28:46.080" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to resurrect this idea that</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.240" end="00:28:47.760" style="s2">the cosmos is something more like an</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.080" end="00:28:50.080" style="s2">organism in how it</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.760" end="00:28:51.679" style="s2">evolves and changes yes and how the</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.080" end="00:28:54.080" style="s2">process of creation carries out</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.679" end="00:28:55.679" style="s2">um yeah so yeah it&#39;s playful but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.080" end="00:28:58.000" style="s2">also like i think that this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.679" end="00:28:58.720" style="s2">reality is like literally true at least</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.000" end="00:29:01.360" style="s2">those</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.720" end="00:29:02.480" style="s2">fundamental propositions that it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.360" end="00:29:04.799" style="s2">grounded upon</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.480" end="00:29:06.559" style="s2">so it&#39;s kind of uh a white hedian</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.799" end="00:29:09.360" style="s2">version of neoplatonism</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.559" end="00:29:10.399" style="s2">then i i think you&#39;ll have to elaborate</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.360" end="00:29:13.440" style="s2">that reference for me</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.399" end="00:29:16.080" style="s2">uh so uh you know how</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.440" end="00:29:16.799" style="s2">whitehead basically tried to bring back</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.080" end="00:29:19.840" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.799" end="00:29:23.279" style="s2">organic an organic model um</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.840" end="00:29:25.120" style="s2">on organic metaphysics um in</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.279" end="00:29:26.320" style="s2">but in a way that was very uh</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.120" end="00:29:29.039" style="s2">neoplatonic</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.320" end="00:29:29.520" style="s2">but he tried to do it in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.039" end="00:29:31.919" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.520" end="00:29:33.520" style="s2">ultimately be consonant with two</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.919" end="00:29:34.320" style="s2">projects one was what he called religion</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.520" end="00:29:36.159" style="s2">in the making</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.320" end="00:29:37.520" style="s2">the title of one of his books and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.159" end="00:29:39.200" style="s2">other project was</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.520" end="00:29:41.120" style="s2">getting uh get and these two projects</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.200" end="00:29:44.559" style="s2">are supposed to be linked getting us</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.120" end="00:29:46.240" style="s2">into a metaphysics that is also um</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.559" end="00:29:48.559" style="s2">gives us a better way of interpreting</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.240" end="00:29:50.320" style="s2">and understanding our science</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.559" end="00:29:51.679" style="s2">but interpreting and understanding it in</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.320" end="00:29:52.240" style="s2">a way that is consonant with the</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.679" end="00:29:54.960" style="s2">religion</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.240" end="00:29:56.240" style="s2">in the making um that&#39;s that&#39;s very much</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.960" end="00:29:58.080" style="s2">his project</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.240" end="00:29:59.760" style="s2">yeah yeah that sounds just about right</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.080" end="00:30:01.200" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting i&#39;ve been putting off</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.760" end="00:30:02.640" style="s2">reading whitehead for a while maybe</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.200" end="00:30:04.399" style="s2">that&#39;s been a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.640" end="00:30:05.679" style="s2">i would do not start with process in</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.399" end="00:30:06.799" style="s2">reality which is one of the hardest</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.679" end="00:30:09.120" style="s2">books to read</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.799" end="00:30:10.880" style="s2">um you might want the book that might be</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.120" end="00:30:11.919" style="s2">uh the two books that would be relevant</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.880" end="00:30:14.720" style="s2">to your project might be</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.919" end="00:30:15.440" style="s2">um i think science and education maybe</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.720" end="00:30:17.440" style="s2">or at least</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.440" end="00:30:19.679" style="s2">um a really good book would probably be</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.440" end="00:30:20.960" style="s2">religion in the making</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.679" end="00:30:23.679" style="s2">oh yeah yeah that sounds about right</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.960" end="00:30:27.760" style="s2">excellent i&#39;ve also come across a recent</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.679" end="00:30:29.279" style="s2">um thing sent by my friend simon cook</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.760" end="00:30:31.520" style="s2">there was this guy in like the early</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.279" end="00:30:33.679" style="s2">20th century who was a part of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.520" end="00:30:35.120" style="s2">sort of socialist movements in russia he</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.679" end="00:30:36.960" style="s2">was one of the ones who got sort of</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.120" end="00:30:38.320" style="s2">you know excommunicated and not taken</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.960" end="00:30:40.399" style="s2">seriously but</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.320" end="00:30:42.159" style="s2">he had this project called god building</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.399" end="00:30:43.600" style="s2">and i was like amazed it seemed like</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.159" end="00:30:45.600" style="s2">very much similar to like what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.600" end="00:30:47.679" style="s2">trying to do what i&#39;m trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.600" end="00:30:49.039" style="s2">um and the idea was to like look at how</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.679" end="00:30:51.600" style="s2">religion was positive</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.039" end="00:30:54.559" style="s2">and to construct a religion that would</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.600" end="00:30:56.480" style="s2">best meet the needs of a society that</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.559" end="00:30:59.039" style="s2">could meet everybody&#39;s needs who is this</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.480" end="00:31:01.200" style="s2">theorist his name is luna charsky</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.039" end="00:31:03.440" style="s2">i&#39;d like to know more about it so i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.200" end="00:31:05.679" style="s2">thank simon for passing that on</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.440" end="00:31:07.279" style="s2">uh but yeah if you i&#39;d like to know if</p>

<p begin="00:31:13.039" end="00:31:15.919" style="s2">unfortunately not a lot of his books</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.559" end="00:31:16.960" style="s2">still left out because he was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.919" end="00:31:18.640" style="s2">like forgotten about</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.960" end="00:31:21.039" style="s2">um i think maybe he was a bit too kind</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.640" end="00:31:22.559" style="s2">for to religion for the the soviets to</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.039" end="00:31:24.320" style="s2">really</p>

<p begin="00:32:49.840" end="00:32:52.000" style="s2">actually a very good time for many</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.279" end="00:32:54.480" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.000" end="00:32:55.279" style="s2">uh since covet has shifted schedules</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.480" end="00:32:58.480" style="s2">around</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.279" end="00:33:00.080" style="s2">a lot for a lot of yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.480" end="00:33:01.519" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s been a blessing and a curse</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.080" end="00:33:03.279" style="s2">you know it&#39;s given me a lot of time to</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.519" end="00:33:04.240" style="s2">like work on a lot of music production</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.279" end="00:33:06.320" style="s2">to work on this book</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.240" end="00:33:07.679" style="s2">and to also uh kind of conceive this</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.320" end="00:33:08.240" style="s2">project it&#39;s been kind of nice although</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.679" end="00:33:10.559" style="s2">i i</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.240" end="00:33:13.039" style="s2">definitely am finding i&#39;m yearning for</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.559" end="00:33:16.240" style="s2">that more collective kind of experience</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.039" end="00:33:17.760" style="s2">sure sure so is there anything else you</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.240" end="00:33:19.519" style="s2">want to talk about in connection</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.760" end="00:33:21.600" style="s2">on with these two projects i mean you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.519" end="00:33:25.200" style="s2">been very eloquent so far</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.600" end="00:33:28.080" style="s2">we can talk about literally anything um</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.200" end="00:33:29.519" style="s2">like this project is the culmination of</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.080" end="00:33:30.799" style="s2">basically all of the research all of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.519" end="00:33:32.080" style="s2">study that i&#39;ve been doing so</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.799" end="00:33:33.440" style="s2">um i don&#39;t know where do you want to</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.080" end="00:33:35.039" style="s2">take it i mean we could talk about</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.440" end="00:33:38.000" style="s2">mystical experiences the spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.039" end="00:33:38.000" style="s2">dimension of experience</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.840" end="00:33:42.480" style="s2">but they might be more practical and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.360" end="00:33:44.559" style="s2">worried about those questions being</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.480" end="00:33:46.720" style="s2">premature because of the stage you&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.559" end="00:33:48.080" style="s2">so if i ask them don&#39;t don&#39;t feel that</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.720" end="00:33:49.200" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re obligated to have an</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.080" end="00:33:51.840" style="s2">answer right now</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.200" end="00:33:52.320" style="s2">right uh so you know one of my questions</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.840" end="00:33:54.559" style="s2">will white</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.320" end="00:33:55.919" style="s2">what might be what do you do when people</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.559" end="00:33:58.320" style="s2">have various</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.919" end="00:34:00.159" style="s2">mystical experiences uh and because</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.320" end="00:34:02.159" style="s2">people have variation in that</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.159" end="00:34:03.919" style="s2">uh how is that going to be integrated</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.159" end="00:34:04.880" style="s2">into what&#39;s happening to them</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.919" end="00:34:07.120" style="s2">how are you going to help people</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.880" end="00:34:08.720" style="s2">distinguish between</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.120" end="00:34:10.800" style="s2">you know mystical experiences and</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.720" end="00:34:14.399" style="s2">perhaps psychotic experiences</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.800" end="00:34:16.560" style="s2">or other kinds of breakdown issues um</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.399" end="00:34:17.440" style="s2">there&#39;s that concern uh you know we</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.560" end="00:34:19.679" style="s2">don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.440" end="00:34:20.960" style="s2">i would not want to be involved in</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.679" end="00:34:22.960" style="s2">creating</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.960" end="00:34:25.200" style="s2">yet another game that contributes to the</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.960" end="00:34:28.159" style="s2">virtual exodus from reality</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.200" end="00:34:29.599" style="s2">right right uh and so what what would be</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.159" end="00:34:31.839" style="s2">the constraints in there that</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.599" end="00:34:34.000" style="s2">actually so i mentioned talk and tolkien</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.839" end="00:34:35.359" style="s2">has the recovery theory where he</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.000" end="00:34:37.359" style="s2">distinguishes between good and bad</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.359" end="00:34:40.159" style="s2">fantasy in terms of recovery</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.359" end="00:34:41.760" style="s2">bad fantasy is escapist right good</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.159" end="00:34:42.399" style="s2">fantasy is you go there you go through</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.760" end="00:34:44.000" style="s2">something like an</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.399" end="00:34:46.000" style="s2">anthropological experience to become</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.000" end="00:34:48.320" style="s2">enculturated in that other</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.000" end="00:34:50.480" style="s2">world so that when you return to this</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.320" end="00:34:52.879" style="s2">one you see it in a new way</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.480" end="00:34:54.720" style="s2">the point is to recover this world</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.879" end="00:34:57.839" style="s2">through the augmentation of</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.720" end="00:34:59.599" style="s2">the fantasy world and i think that what</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.839" end="00:35:02.160" style="s2">you&#39;re proposing is of course this</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.599" end="00:35:04.160" style="s2">the second not the escapist first</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.160" end="00:35:05.599" style="s2">because we have lots of escapist games</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.160" end="00:35:07.520" style="s2">we have lots of them and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.599" end="00:35:09.040" style="s2">proliferating and they&#39;re actually being</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.520" end="00:35:10.160" style="s2">quite destructive of individual and</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.040" end="00:35:12.320" style="s2">collective lives</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.160" end="00:35:14.880" style="s2">so my concern would be how to structure</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.320" end="00:35:18.720" style="s2">this so that it doesn&#39;t become escapist</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.880" end="00:35:21.520" style="s2">instead how it how it affords recovery</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.720" end="00:35:22.880" style="s2">so the framing of the game just</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.520" end="00:35:26.160" style="s2">inherently</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.880" end="00:35:27.280" style="s2">promotes that kind of um return to the</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.160" end="00:35:29.839" style="s2">natural world</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.280" end="00:35:31.680" style="s2">um and this kind of recovery of not only</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.839" end="00:35:33.760" style="s2">meaning but also of active</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.680" end="00:35:35.359" style="s2">agent-oriented participation right</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.760" end="00:35:37.040" style="s2">because the whole premise is that</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.359" end="00:35:39.440" style="s2">the world around you is kind of messed</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.040" end="00:35:40.800" style="s2">up for a lot of reasons and we can</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.440" end="00:35:42.960" style="s2">relate to the way in which it&#39;s messed</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.800" end="00:35:44.560" style="s2">up by articulating it as this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.960" end="00:35:46.720" style="s2">person technic</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.560" end="00:35:47.920" style="s2">who has this kind of power and force</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.720" end="00:35:49.920" style="s2">over the world</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.920" end="00:35:51.119" style="s2">and then the school the academy is put</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.920" end="00:35:53.440" style="s2">into direct</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.119" end="00:35:55.280" style="s2">opposition um collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.440" end="00:35:57.040" style="s2">participation with that reality</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.280" end="00:35:58.720" style="s2">so the whole point of the game is to</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.040" end="00:36:01.680" style="s2">grapple with things that are happening</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.720" end="00:36:03.599" style="s2">in the here and now right excellent so</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.680" end="00:36:05.440" style="s2">that will be a strong thematic thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.599" end="00:36:06.640" style="s2">throughout all of the game so that</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.440" end="00:36:07.920" style="s2">people yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.640" end="00:36:09.839" style="s2">yeah and what i really want to do is i</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.920" end="00:36:12.079" style="s2">want to like be able to facilitate</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.839" end="00:36:13.839" style="s2">um perspectival shifts so that even when</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.079" end="00:36:15.680" style="s2">somebody&#39;s not actively in a game</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.839" end="00:36:17.920" style="s2">scenario just out in the world</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.680" end="00:36:19.200" style="s2">they can see an advertisement or see a</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.920" end="00:36:21.280" style="s2">business or</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.200" end="00:36:22.720" style="s2">you know they&#39;re searching on amazon one</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.280" end="00:36:24.800" style="s2">day and maybe they&#39;re like oh my god i</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.720" end="00:36:27.920" style="s2">can really see how this is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.800" end="00:36:29.599" style="s2">you know bound to this entity technic</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.920" end="00:36:31.520" style="s2">right um i want to be able to shift</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.599" end="00:36:32.720" style="s2">these kinds of uh promote these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.520" end="00:36:35.920" style="s2">shifts in perspective</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.720" end="00:36:39.680" style="s2">in the everyday world excellent</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.920" end="00:36:41.520" style="s2">so how would you also</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.680" end="00:36:43.839" style="s2">keep it symbolic and metaphoric so</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.520" end="00:36:45.760" style="s2">people don&#39;t generate just yet another</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.839" end="00:36:47.200" style="s2">wacky conspiracy theory out of all of</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.760" end="00:36:49.760" style="s2">this yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.200" end="00:36:50.800" style="s2">so i mean the conspiratorial aspect is</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.760" end="00:36:53.680" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.800" end="00:36:54.960" style="s2">great like it&#39;s it&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.680" end="00:36:56.560" style="s2">tongue-in-cheek</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.960" end="00:36:58.560" style="s2">right because you&#39;re participating in a</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.560" end="00:37:00.079" style="s2">secret society and right now</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.560" end="00:37:01.839" style="s2">in the cultural mind there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.079" end="00:37:02.720" style="s2">talk about secret societies and how</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.839" end="00:37:05.040" style="s2">they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.720" end="00:37:06.560" style="s2">manipulating reality right there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.040" end="00:37:08.560" style="s2">narrative where obama created the</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.560" end="00:37:10.480" style="s2">coronavirus as part of a democratic</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.560" end="00:37:12.240" style="s2">communist takeover</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.480" end="00:37:14.160" style="s2">none of this really makes any like good</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.240" end="00:37:16.960" style="s2">rational sense you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.160" end="00:37:18.880" style="s2">i mean sure maybe there are some</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.960" end="00:37:20.240" style="s2">nefarious things happening with the the</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.880" end="00:37:22.160" style="s2">coronavirus but like</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.240" end="00:37:23.920" style="s2">i don&#39;t know the the whole narrative</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.160" end="00:37:26.079" style="s2">where it&#39;s webbed into this thing where</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.920" end="00:37:27.839" style="s2">america is the prime actor in all global</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.079" end="00:37:28.960" style="s2">affairs and so therefore we need to vote</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.839" end="00:37:31.599" style="s2">for donald trump</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.960" end="00:37:32.720" style="s2">that seems a little bit like the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.599" end="00:37:36.079" style="s2">kind of way to go</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.720" end="00:37:37.680" style="s2">you know um so what i really want this</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.079" end="00:37:39.680" style="s2">game to do is to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.680" end="00:37:41.440" style="s2">capture and interface with these</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.680" end="00:37:43.440" style="s2">tendencies that people have towards</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.440" end="00:37:43.839" style="s2">conspiratorial thinking to allow for a</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.440" end="00:37:46.960" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.839" end="00:37:48.800" style="s2">healthy avenue and arena for expression</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.960" end="00:37:50.480" style="s2">so you&#39;re trying to trigger but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.800" end="00:37:51.359" style="s2">trying to trigger that machinery but</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.480" end="00:37:54.000" style="s2">exact it</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.359" end="00:37:55.280" style="s2">uh for uh uh uh for the training of</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.000" end="00:37:56.880" style="s2">wisdom basically</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.280" end="00:37:58.640" style="s2">yeah yeah like there&#39;s a need that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.880" end="00:38:00.960" style="s2">being unmet in people which is</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.640" end="00:38:03.040" style="s2">promoting them making meaning according</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.960" end="00:38:04.720" style="s2">to these maladaptive</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.040" end="00:38:06.560" style="s2">schemas right because i would say that</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.720" end="00:38:08.160" style="s2">the embodied relationship of like</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.560" end="00:38:10.560" style="s2">voting for somebody who is like an</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.160" end="00:38:12.240" style="s2">incoherent and possibly fascist mess</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.560" end="00:38:14.160" style="s2">that&#39;s not like a great relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.240" end="00:38:15.839" style="s2">take to reality and those beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.160" end="00:38:18.240" style="s2">are promoting that relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.839" end="00:38:20.400" style="s2">reality they&#39;re promoting that action</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.240" end="00:38:21.680" style="s2">and if you look at how global affairs</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.400" end="00:38:25.359" style="s2">have been in the last</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.680" end="00:38:27.680" style="s2">like 50 years you know we have been</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.359" end="00:38:29.119" style="s2">far removed from a world that is built</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.680" end="00:38:31.440" style="s2">on truth</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.119" end="00:38:33.839" style="s2">everything is show everything is theater</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.440" end="00:38:36.400" style="s2">right this is an explicit part of</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.839" end="00:38:37.920" style="s2">um the conservative ethos i remember you</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.400" end="00:38:38.320" style="s2">know back when there was another wave of</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.920" end="00:38:40.240" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.320" end="00:38:42.160" style="s2">um worry about sort of fascism</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.240" end="00:38:43.920" style="s2">especially in the united states</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.160" end="00:38:45.680" style="s2">um there was a lot of talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.920" end="00:38:47.599" style="s2">post-truth world and how</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.680" end="00:38:50.160" style="s2">what people perceive is a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.599" end="00:38:51.680" style="s2">important than what actually is the case</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.160" end="00:38:54.000" style="s2">and so a lot of political actors and a</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.680" end="00:38:56.720" style="s2">lot of news sources will attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.000" end="00:38:58.320" style="s2">broadcast information warped into this</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.720" end="00:38:58.880" style="s2">kind of narrative that promotes an</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.320" end="00:39:00.880" style="s2">action</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.880" end="00:39:02.880" style="s2">in their favor as opposed to actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.880" end="00:39:05.040" style="s2">broadcasting and demonstrating truth</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.880" end="00:39:06.320" style="s2">this has also been very common in russia</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.040" end="00:39:06.960" style="s2">i was watching a documentary with my</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.320" end="00:39:09.119" style="s2">roommates</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.960" end="00:39:10.560" style="s2">just the other day and i learned that</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.119" end="00:39:13.440" style="s2">one of putin&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.560" end="00:39:14.800" style="s2">right hand guys is he comes from</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.440" end="00:39:17.440" style="s2">absurdist theater</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.800" end="00:39:19.040" style="s2">and so he has made the political arena</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.440" end="00:39:20.880" style="s2">an absurdist theater act</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.040" end="00:39:22.320" style="s2">trying to constantly destabilize</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.880" end="00:39:24.800" style="s2">people&#39;s perceptions</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.320" end="00:39:26.800" style="s2">and to do that he stages protests he</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.800" end="00:39:29.280" style="s2">uses like secret service money</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.800" end="00:39:30.320" style="s2">in russia to fund entire opposition</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.280" end="00:39:32.960" style="s2">parties</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.320" end="00:39:33.359" style="s2">um different human rights movements that</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.960" end="00:39:35.440" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.359" end="00:39:36.960" style="s2">um harass the president and everything</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.440" end="00:39:38.320" style="s2">and then after a while he came out and</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.960" end="00:39:39.839" style="s2">was like yes this is what i&#39;m doing i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.320" end="00:39:40.160" style="s2">basically just been paying everybody to</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.839" end="00:39:43.440" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.160" end="00:39:45.359" style="s2">you know have these political conflicts</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.440" end="00:39:47.040" style="s2">and now nobody knows what the hell to do</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.359" end="00:39:48.720" style="s2">right right right</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.040" end="00:39:49.520" style="s2">and so there&#39;s and they don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.720" end="00:39:51.040" style="s2">to do because they don&#39;t know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.520" end="00:39:51.839" style="s2">real they don&#39;t know what to act on they</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.040" end="00:39:55.040" style="s2">don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.839" end="00:39:56.720" style="s2">propositions what beliefs to use as a</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.040" end="00:39:59.440" style="s2">way to inform their relationship</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.720" end="00:40:00.480" style="s2">to reality um and so that just allows</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.440" end="00:40:03.520" style="s2">the the powers</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.480" end="00:40:05.680" style="s2">that be to push their agendas uh and to</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.520" end="00:40:06.960" style="s2">have minimal opposition in that fact</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.680" end="00:40:08.480" style="s2">and while it&#39;s very clear to see that</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.960" end="00:40:09.760" style="s2">happening in russia i think it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.480" end="00:40:11.200" style="s2">very clear to see that happening in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.760" end="00:40:13.280" style="s2">united states which of course</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.200" end="00:40:14.400" style="s2">influences how we do things in canada</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.280" end="00:40:17.440" style="s2">right right</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.400" end="00:40:20.400" style="s2">and so the idea again is um</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.440" end="00:40:22.160" style="s2">the kind of the way a parable may looks</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.400" end="00:40:24.480" style="s2">like it&#39;s making use of narrative</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.160" end="00:40:25.440" style="s2">but then undermines it from within that</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.480" end="00:40:28.640" style="s2">narrative</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.440" end="00:40:30.560" style="s2">uh uh you know that that</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.640" end="00:40:31.839" style="s2">narrative habit and so what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.560" end="00:40:32.880" style="s2">trying to do is sort of trigger a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.839" end="00:40:34.720" style="s2">these habits</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.880" end="00:40:36.400" style="s2">but undermine them within so you get</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.720" end="00:40:37.280" style="s2">well a great awakening so people start</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.400" end="00:40:40.240" style="s2">to awaken</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.280" end="00:40:40.560" style="s2">towards an orientation towards one of</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.240" end="00:40:43.440" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.560" end="00:40:45.200" style="s2">sort of central features i argued for</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.440" end="00:40:48.400" style="s2">wisdom by socrates which is</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.200" end="00:40:50.720" style="s2">to recouple what you find salient</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.400" end="00:40:51.520" style="s2">to your seeking of what is true and most</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.720" end="00:40:53.599" style="s2">real</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.520" end="00:40:54.880" style="s2">yeah absolutely and i&#39;m glad that you</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.599" end="00:40:55.520" style="s2">brought up socrates here because i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.880" end="00:40:58.400" style="s2">been thinking</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.520" end="00:40:59.440" style="s2">um in terms of so in in the book that</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.400" end="00:41:00.800" style="s2">we&#39;re writing</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.440" end="00:41:02.000" style="s2">one of the things that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.800" end="00:41:03.280" style="s2">important is the distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.000" end="00:41:04.560" style="s2">different theories of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.280" end="00:41:06.319" style="s2">right so we have the correspondence</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.560" end="00:41:06.880" style="s2">theory and the conformity theory right</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.319" end="00:41:08.319" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.880" end="00:41:09.760" style="s2">so i think that both of those are true i</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.319" end="00:41:12.720" style="s2">think that the conformity theory is the</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.760" end="00:41:14.800" style="s2">foundation for knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.720" end="00:41:16.400" style="s2">the uh the embodied relationship that an</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.800" end="00:41:18.720" style="s2">organism takes to its</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.400" end="00:41:19.520" style="s2">environment which promotes its continued</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.720" end="00:41:21.599" style="s2">existence</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.520" end="00:41:23.200" style="s2">um that is the organism knowing its</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.599" end="00:41:25.760" style="s2">environment by conforming to it</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.200" end="00:41:27.200" style="s2">yes exactly participatory knowing yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.760" end="00:41:28.480" style="s2">yeah and so like most of the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.200" end="00:41:29.920" style="s2">knowing that we have are like that i</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.480" end="00:41:32.319" style="s2">think participatory</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.920" end="00:41:33.200" style="s2">um perspectival and even procedural</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.319" end="00:41:36.000" style="s2">knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.200" end="00:41:37.280" style="s2">are about conformity yeah yeah whereas</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.000" end="00:41:38.960" style="s2">the propositions that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.280" end="00:41:40.400" style="s2">very small slice of knowledge it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.960" end="00:41:40.880" style="s2">the after effect of just like this</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.400" end="00:41:43.119" style="s2">massive</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.880" end="00:41:44.960" style="s2">neural output that&#39;s when you finally</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.119" end="00:41:47.760" style="s2">get propositions it&#39;s like the crust</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.960" end="00:41:48.880" style="s2">on top of how we know reality yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.760" end="00:41:51.680" style="s2">that&#39;s where coherence and</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.880" end="00:41:54.880" style="s2">correspondence come out as more crucial</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.680" end="00:41:55.760" style="s2">yeah yeah so in relation to socrates</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.880" end="00:41:57.680" style="s2">i&#39;ve been thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.760" end="00:41:59.040" style="s2">his propositions of you know claiming to</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.680" end="00:42:01.440" style="s2">not really know anything</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.040" end="00:42:02.560" style="s2">and i was thinking hmm that makes a lot</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.440" end="00:42:04.560" style="s2">of sense if you think about that in</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.560" end="00:42:07.520" style="s2">terms of the embodied relationship</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.560" end="00:42:09.520" style="s2">if you act as if you know nothing i</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.520" end="00:42:12.480" style="s2">think that you&#39;re much more likely to</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.520" end="00:42:13.920" style="s2">have a pro-social and adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.480" end="00:42:14.800" style="s2">relationship with reality one that</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.920" end="00:42:17.119" style="s2">allows you to</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.800" end="00:42:18.800" style="s2">change your frame in an ongoing way to</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.119" end="00:42:19.520" style="s2">pick up on the nuance of the present</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.800" end="00:42:21.119" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.520" end="00:42:23.599" style="s2">right if you&#39;re too dogmatic about a</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.119" end="00:42:26.640" style="s2">proposition matt acts as</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.599" end="00:42:29.040" style="s2">a kind of bayesian filter which makes</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.640" end="00:42:30.560" style="s2">unlikely things that you don&#39;t expect</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.040" end="00:42:32.000" style="s2">right if you think that this proposition</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.560" end="00:42:34.319" style="s2">is always true</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.000" end="00:42:36.240" style="s2">it&#39;s going to impair how you&#39;re updating</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.319" end="00:42:38.640" style="s2">your beliefs because maybe in one</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.240" end="00:42:39.920" style="s2">context it isn&#39;t and i think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.640" end="00:42:41.440" style="s2">like actually a pretty good lesson for</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.920" end="00:42:43.280" style="s2">how to deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.440" end="00:42:44.560" style="s2">weird situation that we have now where</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.280" end="00:42:46.000" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of conspiratorial</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.560" end="00:42:47.680" style="s2">narratives there&#39;s a lot of genuinely</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.000" end="00:42:48.640" style="s2">fake news we don&#39;t really know what to</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.680" end="00:42:50.960" style="s2">do about it</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.640" end="00:42:51.839" style="s2">um there&#39;s a lot of propaganda out there</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.960" end="00:42:53.520" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.839" end="00:42:55.280" style="s2">as opposed to trying to orient ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.520" end="00:42:56.640" style="s2">towards knowing deeply what is</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.280" end="00:42:57.839" style="s2">propositionally true</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.640" end="00:43:00.640" style="s2">i think that if we followed that</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.839" end="00:43:01.040" style="s2">socratic method and acted as if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.640" end="00:43:02.720" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.040" end="00:43:04.160" style="s2">know but we&#39;re just trying to have the</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.720" end="00:43:06.480" style="s2">best kind of relationship</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.160" end="00:43:07.440" style="s2">um with reality uh knowing what to care</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.480" end="00:43:08.960" style="s2">about right</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.440" end="00:43:10.960" style="s2">the one thing that socrates did claim to</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.960" end="00:43:11.680" style="s2">know i think that&#39;s a pretty good lesson</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.960" end="00:43:14.000" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.680" end="00:43:15.680" style="s2">could be taken up to mitigate some of</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.000" end="00:43:17.359" style="s2">the harms of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.680" end="00:43:18.960" style="s2">current narrative chaos that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.359" end="00:43:21.280" style="s2">situated in</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.960" end="00:43:22.160" style="s2">so the kind of play is not only a</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.280" end="00:43:25.520" style="s2">serious play it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.160" end="00:43:27.440" style="s2">it&#39;s socratically serious play right</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.520" end="00:43:29.920" style="s2">and and you of course there&#39;s a there is</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.440" end="00:43:32.480" style="s2">a huge element of playfulness within</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.920" end="00:43:33.280" style="s2">uh socrates uh performance within the</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.480" end="00:43:35.440" style="s2">dialogues</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.280" end="00:43:36.560" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of a lot of play in there</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.440" end="00:43:38.880" style="s2">but that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.560" end="00:43:42.640" style="s2">i like that that&#39;s very it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.880" end="00:43:45.760" style="s2">interesting uh way of bringing it in</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.640" end="00:43:47.599" style="s2">so what&#39;s what&#39;s sort of the i mean this</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.760" end="00:43:49.440" style="s2">is probably</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.599" end="00:43:51.280" style="s2">this is definitely a premature question</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.440" end="00:43:52.640" style="s2">so i take it that you can answer it very</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.280" end="00:43:54.480" style="s2">vaguely and schematically</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.640" end="00:43:56.160" style="s2">but what&#39;s sort of the timeline you see</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.480" end="00:43:59.280" style="s2">for this</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.160" end="00:44:02.160" style="s2">i would love to be able to run the first</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.280" end="00:44:03.839" style="s2">rendition of this next spring summer</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.160" end="00:44:07.040" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.839" end="00:44:08.160" style="s2">that&#39;s great wow that&#39;s really cool</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.040" end="00:44:09.760" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s gonna be a lot of work which</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.160" end="00:44:11.200" style="s2">is why i need to like you know get it</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.760" end="00:44:12.480" style="s2">out there that i need help and i need to</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.200" end="00:44:13.119" style="s2">like build a collective of people to</p>

<p begin="00:44:13.119" end="00:44:16.400" style="s2">because like i don&#39;t know i&#39;ve done a</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.640" end="00:44:18.079" style="s2">lot of organizing but i tend to</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.400" end="00:44:19.520" style="s2">uh take on way too much work and trying</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.079" end="00:44:20.640" style="s2">to do everything myself and i was</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.520" end="00:44:22.000" style="s2">thinking about this project and i was</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.640" end="00:44:24.480" style="s2">like there&#39;s no way that i could do</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.000" end="00:44:26.640" style="s2">anything remotely like that yeah yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.480" end="00:44:27.280" style="s2">agree i i also suffer from that the</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.640" end="00:44:31.200" style="s2">setting sin</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.280" end="00:44:34.560" style="s2">as well that i take out way too much um</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.200" end="00:44:37.040" style="s2">is there anything else that</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.560" end="00:44:38.319" style="s2">i mean i&#39;m hoping that because you&#39;re on</p>

<p begin="00:44:39.839" end="00:44:42.800" style="s2">invited to the discord server</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.520" end="00:44:44.079" style="s2">and i think there&#39;s like over a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.800" end="00:44:44.720" style="s2">people there there&#39;s a very extensive</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.079" end="00:44:46.560" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.720" end="00:44:48.079" style="s2">so you get to interact with them and be</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.560" end="00:44:51.040" style="s2">involved with them they&#39;ll have</p>

<p begin="00:44:56.400" end="00:44:59.599" style="s2">is there anything else i could do to</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.000" end="00:45:00.960" style="s2">help um</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.599" end="00:45:02.640" style="s2">you know i feel like we could talk about</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.960" end="00:45:05.280" style="s2">that stuff um</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.640" end="00:45:06.720" style="s2">in the in the after math of the video um</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.280" end="00:45:07.920" style="s2">i&#39;m really interested in talking about</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.720" end="00:45:10.560" style="s2">some of the more specifics</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.920" end="00:45:11.040" style="s2">uh theoretically um i&#39;d like to have</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.560" end="00:45:13.280" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.040" end="00:45:14.319" style="s2">have a good thorough understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.280" end="00:45:15.440" style="s2">like where i&#39;m coming from what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.319" end="00:45:16.960" style="s2">trying to achieve</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.440" end="00:45:18.079" style="s2">um and we can also bring in some of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.960" end="00:45:19.599" style="s2">stuff about the book as well because</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.079" end="00:45:20.240" style="s2">that&#39;s basically the foundational</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.599" end="00:45:24.000" style="s2">document</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.240" end="00:45:26.000" style="s2">that&#39;s really helping me uh orient my</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.000" end="00:45:27.680" style="s2">uh implementation of this project well</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.000" end="00:45:29.520" style="s2">there&#39;s a way i can bring the practical</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.680" end="00:45:30.560" style="s2">and the theoretical together then on</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.520" end="00:45:33.280" style="s2">the question do you think it&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.560" end="00:45:36.880" style="s2">possible uh to coordinate the release</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.280" end="00:45:38.400" style="s2">of the great awakening with the book</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.880" end="00:45:40.480" style="s2">because they would probably therefore</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.400" end="00:45:43.520" style="s2">mutually afford each other</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.480" end="00:45:45.040" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s possible let me think</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.520" end="00:45:47.839" style="s2">about that</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.040" end="00:45:47.839" style="s2">hmm</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.240" end="00:45:50.960" style="s2">my intuition right now is that i think</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.920" end="00:45:52.319" style="s2">just because we&#39;ve already done like a</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.960" end="00:45:53.599" style="s2">crowdfunding campaign for and we have a</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.319" end="00:45:55.920" style="s2">bunch of people waiting for it</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.599" end="00:45:57.200" style="s2">that it might be good to get that out</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.920" end="00:45:59.760" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.200" end="00:46:01.280" style="s2">as soon as possible um and then i think</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.760" end="00:46:01.920" style="s2">that also just having the book available</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.280" end="00:46:03.040" style="s2">to be read</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.920" end="00:46:04.960" style="s2">and then telling people that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.040" end="00:46:07.359" style="s2">like a game that you can like</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.960" end="00:46:09.440" style="s2">uh play to learn more and to have um</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.359" end="00:46:11.119" style="s2">some more education in these concepts</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.440" end="00:46:12.960" style="s2">i think that might be a good way to go</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.119" end="00:46:14.400" style="s2">about it and the reverse once people</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.960" end="00:46:16.240" style="s2">start taking up the game you can point</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.400" end="00:46:17.760" style="s2">them to the existing book</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.240" end="00:46:19.520" style="s2">yeah what i&#39;ve been wanting to do is to</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.760" end="00:46:22.240" style="s2">build an online course about the book</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.520" end="00:46:23.760" style="s2">because it&#39;s a little bit dense but um i</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.240" end="00:46:25.599" style="s2">was thinking that i could just have that</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.760" end="00:46:28.240" style="s2">course be a part of that game</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.599" end="00:46:29.680" style="s2">oh that&#39;s cool that&#39;s cool so this game</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.240" end="00:46:30.800" style="s2">will take a long time to play you said</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.680" end="00:46:33.839" style="s2">about three months</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.800" end="00:46:37.040" style="s2">yeah at least that yeah how much per day</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.839" end="00:46:39.119" style="s2">would people be committing time uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.040" end="00:46:40.640" style="s2">that&#39;s a good question i&#39;m thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.119" end="00:46:43.440" style="s2">something along the lines of like</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.640" end="00:46:43.920" style="s2">like a part-time uh university course</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.440" end="00:46:46.079" style="s2">load</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.920" end="00:46:46.960" style="s2">so maybe like 10 to 15 hours a week</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.079" end="00:46:49.119" style="s2">something like that so</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.960" end="00:46:50.000" style="s2">it&#39;s you got to really set the time</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.119" end="00:46:51.359" style="s2">aside but</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.000" end="00:46:53.040" style="s2">you know the more the more you give the</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.359" end="00:46:55.839" style="s2">more you get out of it of course</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.040" end="00:46:56.800" style="s2">like any good game so now up back to a</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.839" end="00:46:59.359" style="s2">more theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.800" end="00:47:00.880" style="s2">level um tonight on peter lindberg&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.359" end="00:47:01.599" style="s2">estoa i&#39;m going to be talking with james</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.880" end="00:47:03.359" style="s2">cars</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.599" end="00:47:05.520" style="s2">who wrote the religious case against</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.359" end="00:47:07.760" style="s2">belief but more relevant right now</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.520" end="00:47:09.040" style="s2">he wrote a book that on reading called</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.760" end="00:47:10.480" style="s2">finite and infinite games and he</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.040" end="00:47:11.599" style="s2">distinguishes between trying to play a</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.480" end="00:47:14.000" style="s2">finite game</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.599" end="00:47:14.960" style="s2">and trying to play an infinite game the</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.000" end="00:47:16.640" style="s2">finite game</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.960" end="00:47:18.400" style="s2">the goal of the finite game is to end</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.640" end="00:47:20.160" style="s2">the game so no so nobody can play it</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.400" end="00:47:23.440" style="s2">anymore by having somebody declared</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.160" end="00:47:24.960" style="s2">and entitled as the winner whereas the</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.440" end="00:47:27.599" style="s2">point of the infinite game</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.960" end="00:47:28.480" style="s2">is to figure out how to constantly you</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.599" end="00:47:31.680" style="s2">know adjust</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.480" end="00:47:32.160" style="s2">and modify the rules so that the game</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.680" end="00:47:34.160" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.160" end="00:47:35.920" style="s2">continue to be played over and over</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.160" end="00:47:37.280" style="s2">again i&#39;m very interested in this</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.920" end="00:47:39.839" style="s2">distinction because</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.280" end="00:47:40.720" style="s2">i see debate as a finite game but i see</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.839" end="00:47:42.800" style="s2">via logos</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.720" end="00:47:44.480" style="s2">as an infinite game and trying to figure</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.800" end="00:47:46.240" style="s2">out and therefore the way we</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.480" end="00:47:48.960" style="s2">do debate should not be the way in which</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.240" end="00:47:51.440" style="s2">we try to do via logos</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.960" end="00:47:53.280" style="s2">you can incorporate smaller finite games</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.440" end="00:47:55.040" style="s2">as moves within an infinite game</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.280" end="00:47:57.200" style="s2">but they always have to be encompassed</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.040" end="00:48:00.640" style="s2">within um the larger</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.200" end="00:48:04.160" style="s2">uh project of maintaining play</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.640" end="00:48:06.720" style="s2">um and there and so no one is seeking</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.160" end="00:48:08.400" style="s2">um to be entitled so obviously the</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.720" end="00:48:09.200" style="s2">finite game is much more in metallic</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.400" end="00:48:10.720" style="s2">mode</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.200" end="00:48:13.040" style="s2">and the infinite game is much more</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.720" end="00:48:16.319" style="s2">peritolic etc</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.040" end="00:48:17.599" style="s2">so it sounds to me like one of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.319" end="00:48:20.640" style="s2">things you&#39;re trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.599" end="00:48:21.839" style="s2">also is to take people who are used to</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.640" end="00:48:25.280" style="s2">playing</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.839" end="00:48:28.079" style="s2">finite games virtual games and</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.280" end="00:48:28.880" style="s2">educate them in how to play an infinite</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.079" end="00:48:31.119" style="s2">game</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.880" end="00:48:32.160" style="s2">which is the love of wisdom because we</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.119" end="00:48:34.960" style="s2">never become</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.160" end="00:48:35.680" style="s2">gods we are always in the infinite game</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.960" end="00:48:37.359" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.680" end="00:48:39.440" style="s2">trying to become more and more like the</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.359" end="00:48:41.920" style="s2">gods to use a socratic model</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.440" end="00:48:43.599" style="s2">yeah yeah that sounds exactly like what</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.920" end="00:48:45.440" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to achieve</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.599" end="00:48:47.119" style="s2">within the neoplatonic framework um you</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.440" end="00:48:50.400" style="s2">know theosis is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.119" end="00:48:52.000" style="s2">the primary goals becoming godlike</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.400" end="00:48:54.160" style="s2">and so that&#39;s very much informing how</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.000" end="00:48:55.760" style="s2">i&#39;m structuring this game and it is very</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.160" end="00:48:57.359" style="s2">much an infinite game because there are</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.760" end="00:48:59.280" style="s2">certain perennial problems that</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.359" end="00:49:01.680" style="s2">spirituality is intended to solve</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.280" end="00:49:03.839" style="s2">our tendency towards self-deception yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.680" end="00:49:06.400" style="s2">a tendency towards nihilism</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.839" end="00:49:07.760" style="s2">you know all of those things and so</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.400" end="00:49:09.599" style="s2">those things are never going to go away</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.760" end="00:49:12.000" style="s2">so you have to have an ongoing game that</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.599" end="00:49:13.760" style="s2">can consistently interface with these to</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.000" end="00:49:15.440" style="s2">mitigate these perennial problems</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.760" end="00:49:17.680" style="s2">perennially</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.440" end="00:49:18.800" style="s2">so it sounds like therefore people might</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.680" end="00:49:21.920" style="s2">play the game</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.800" end="00:49:23.839" style="s2">multiple times um yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.920" end="00:49:25.119" style="s2">i want to be able to change it as it</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.839" end="00:49:27.359" style="s2">goes um</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.119" end="00:49:29.200" style="s2">so the game that i&#39;m developing right</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.359" end="00:49:30.000" style="s2">now is very much tailored towards the</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.200" end="00:49:32.160" style="s2">needs of the current</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.000" end="00:49:33.359" style="s2">culture but as the needs of the culture</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.160" end="00:49:34.960" style="s2">change then there will be different</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.359" end="00:49:38.480" style="s2">scenarios that can</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.960" end="00:49:40.480" style="s2">meet those needs excellent excellent</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.480" end="00:49:41.839" style="s2">there&#39;s also like a permanent community</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.480" end="00:49:44.400" style="s2">that you get initiated into</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.839" end="00:49:45.599" style="s2">so once you go through a round of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.400" end="00:49:47.760" style="s2">game then you</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.599" end="00:49:48.960" style="s2">sort of graduate you get like a degree</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.760" end="00:49:50.079" style="s2">in the game and you&#39;re a part of that</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.960" end="00:49:51.359" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.079" end="00:49:53.200" style="s2">kind of similar to like a freemason</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.359" end="00:49:54.720" style="s2">degree and then you sort of unlock new</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.200" end="00:49:56.880" style="s2">capacities so there&#39;ll be certain</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.720" end="00:49:58.960" style="s2">member-only events that you can go to</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.880" end="00:50:00.960" style="s2">i want to have like a big yearly party</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.960" end="00:50:02.480" style="s2">where this alternate timeline phases in</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.960" end="00:50:04.240" style="s2">and you can like hang out with these</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.480" end="00:50:06.720" style="s2">alien beings for a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.240" end="00:50:07.839" style="s2">um this constant festival this return to</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.720" end="00:50:09.440" style="s2">this other reality</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.839" end="00:50:11.680" style="s2">so it&#39;ll be something that&#39;s ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.440" end="00:50:13.599" style="s2">that is mutable that changes</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.680" end="00:50:14.800" style="s2">that allows ongoing participation to</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.599" end="00:50:18.160" style="s2">meet the needs of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.800" end="00:50:20.079" style="s2">current time perhaps the that that</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.160" end="00:50:21.520" style="s2">community will also be a reservoir of</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.079" end="00:50:24.160" style="s2">distributed cognition</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.520" end="00:50:25.599" style="s2">for updating and revising the game yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.160" end="00:50:26.160" style="s2">yeah what i want to do is i want to have</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.599" end="00:50:28.480" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.160" end="00:50:29.200" style="s2">people who graduate the game i want that</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.480" end="00:50:32.319" style="s2">to be the</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.200" end="00:50:34.880" style="s2">um hiring pool ah right right</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.319" end="00:50:36.559" style="s2">that&#39;s cool that&#39;s very very cool yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.880" end="00:50:38.720" style="s2">so if this grows large enough um</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.559" end="00:50:40.000" style="s2">which i hope it does i&#39;d like to be like</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.720" end="00:50:41.760" style="s2">a very</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.000" end="00:50:44.160" style="s2">large and comprehensive media production</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.760" end="00:50:45.839" style="s2">thing as well um and i&#39;d like to have</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.160" end="00:50:47.920" style="s2">members who have gone through the game</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.839" end="00:50:48.480" style="s2">uh be the primary people who get hired</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.920" end="00:50:50.720" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.480" end="00:50:52.400" style="s2">work on projects and like way down the</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.720" end="00:50:54.640" style="s2">line you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.400" end="00:50:56.800" style="s2">the the current narrative apparatus of</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.640" end="00:50:58.720" style="s2">our current society you know the</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.800" end="00:51:00.640" style="s2">studios of hollywood and disney all of</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.720" end="00:51:03.599" style="s2">these people that um</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.640" end="00:51:04.559" style="s2">create and sustain our perceptions and</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.599" end="00:51:06.559" style="s2">determine what</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.559" end="00:51:08.079" style="s2">archetypal symbolic narratives are</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.559" end="00:51:10.640" style="s2">activated in us</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.079" end="00:51:12.640" style="s2">these institutions are doing these</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.640" end="00:51:13.680" style="s2">things because they want our capital and</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.640" end="00:51:16.240" style="s2">i think we would be</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.680" end="00:51:18.000" style="s2">foolish to think that the stories aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.240" end="00:51:19.920" style="s2">influenced</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.000" end="00:51:21.680" style="s2">at the end of the day only by that which</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.920" end="00:51:23.599" style="s2">will maximize capital</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.680" end="00:51:25.200" style="s2">and so i&#39;d like to have a system of</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.599" end="00:51:27.280" style="s2">media production of um</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.200" end="00:51:28.800" style="s2">you know movies comic books something</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.280" end="00:51:32.000" style="s2">like a marvel universe</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.800" end="00:51:34.000" style="s2">within this um cosmic narrative</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.000" end="00:51:35.920" style="s2">that can be broadcast out to people but</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.000" end="00:51:37.839" style="s2">then there&#39;s this central mystery school</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.920" end="00:51:40.720" style="s2">that if you want to learn certain core</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.839" end="00:51:42.079" style="s2">truths within this extended uh universe</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.720" end="00:51:43.839" style="s2">uh you go and you participate in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.079" end="00:51:45.920" style="s2">game to like really get the full</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.839" end="00:51:47.200" style="s2">depth that&#39;s being hinted at in all of</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.920" end="00:51:49.040" style="s2">these narratives that are happening in</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.200" end="00:51:51.359" style="s2">this alternate timeline</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.040" end="00:51:52.240" style="s2">so kind of like neoplatonic christianity</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.359" end="00:51:54.000" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.240" end="00:51:56.720" style="s2">yeah yeah it&#39;s very much similar to that</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.000" end="00:51:58.480" style="s2">sort of um sacramental liturgical</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.720" end="00:52:00.160" style="s2">kind of lifestyle which you see being</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.480" end="00:52:02.240" style="s2">reenacted by things like um</p>

<p begin="00:52:02.240" end="00:52:05.839" style="s2">like people desperately want to</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.559" end="00:52:08.480" style="s2">live in these kinds of immersive</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.839" end="00:52:11.680" style="s2">universes yes very much</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.480" end="00:52:13.200" style="s2">right that&#39;s that&#39;s very good</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.680" end="00:52:15.040" style="s2">that&#39;s very good i&#39;m wondering if</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.200" end="00:52:17.520" style="s2">there&#39;s a connection between</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.040" end="00:52:19.280" style="s2">playing finite games and seeking escape</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.520" end="00:52:20.079" style="s2">and playing infinite games and seeking</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.280" end="00:52:22.079" style="s2">recovery</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.079" end="00:52:24.240" style="s2">that&#39;s something that&#39;s that&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.079" end="00:52:26.000" style="s2">sort of reflecting on and trying to draw</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.240" end="00:52:27.760" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.000" end="00:52:29.599" style="s2">what i what comes to mind first when i</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.760" end="00:52:30.319" style="s2">think of that is something like call of</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.599" end="00:52:32.559" style="s2">duty or</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.319" end="00:52:34.480" style="s2">modern warfare which is a finite game</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.559" end="00:52:36.480" style="s2">that you can infinitely play</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.480" end="00:52:38.400" style="s2">it&#39;s something that is simple enough</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.480" end="00:52:41.680" style="s2">that you can have your attention be</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.400" end="00:52:45.040" style="s2">yoked to it for you know hours days</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.680" end="00:52:45.599" style="s2">years but it does have this winner loser</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.040" end="00:52:47.040" style="s2">structure</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.599" end="00:52:48.720" style="s2">so it&#39;s very much a finite game you</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.040" end="00:52:49.920" style="s2">could put it down and leave afterwards</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.720" end="00:52:52.720" style="s2">but very often people</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.920" end="00:52:54.079" style="s2">attempt to um infinitely replicate their</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.720" end="00:52:55.520" style="s2">experience with this game i think league</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.079" end="00:52:57.280" style="s2">of legends is one of those games that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.520" end="00:52:58.720" style="s2">like notorious for this for sucking</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.280" end="00:53:01.280" style="s2">people&#39;s attention in</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.720" end="00:53:02.640" style="s2">right right right right so i think maybe</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.280" end="00:53:03.760" style="s2">there could be like a modal confusion</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.640" end="00:53:07.200" style="s2">thing happening where</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.760" end="00:53:10.559" style="s2">the attempt to um escape to the</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.200" end="00:53:12.079" style="s2">finite game infinitely is more a symptom</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.559" end="00:53:14.400" style="s2">of this mass exodus</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.079" end="00:53:16.000" style="s2">yeah yeah that&#39;s well put i like that i</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.400" end="00:53:17.280" style="s2">like that as a way of responding to my</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.000" end="00:53:20.880" style="s2">question i think that&#39;s very good</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.280" end="00:53:23.760" style="s2">i like that so what about people</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.880" end="00:53:24.880" style="s2">who have established religious</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.760" end="00:53:27.440" style="s2">traditions</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.880" end="00:53:29.680" style="s2">um uh do you think they&#39;d want to play</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.440" end="00:53:32.720" style="s2">this game</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.680" end="00:53:32.720" style="s2">um i hope so</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.200" end="00:53:37.760" style="s2">you know as as as you do as well i try</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.520" end="00:53:40.800" style="s2">to be as respectful as possible to</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.760" end="00:53:42.800" style="s2">all kinds of religious philosophies</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.800" end="00:53:44.160" style="s2">and you know sometimes that goes well</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.800" end="00:53:45.440" style="s2">sometimes it doesn&#39;t well</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.160" end="00:53:47.040" style="s2">let me let me tell you there&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.440" end="00:53:49.200" style="s2">bit more behind my question i i am</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.040" end="00:53:51.599" style="s2">influenced by verse lewis&#39;s argument</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.200" end="00:53:53.119" style="s2">that neoplatonism is sort of the grammar</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.599" end="00:53:54.800" style="s2">of the spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.119" end="00:53:56.800" style="s2">of the west you know of the of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.800" end="00:53:59.200" style="s2">mystical traditions within christianity</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.800" end="00:54:00.559" style="s2">within islam within judaism and degree</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.200" end="00:54:01.839" style="s2">to which i think you&#39;re trying to plug</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.559" end="00:54:04.000" style="s2">into that grammar</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.839" end="00:54:05.359" style="s2">might afford people from different</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.000" end="00:54:07.760" style="s2">faiths being able to</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.359" end="00:54:10.480" style="s2">participate in the game cooperatively</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.760" end="00:54:11.760" style="s2">and even commune together through it</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.480" end="00:54:14.000" style="s2">yeah i think that&#39;s about right i mean</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.760" end="00:54:15.280" style="s2">neoplatonism i i agree with that thesis</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.000" end="00:54:16.720" style="s2">and i i&#39;m definitely</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.280" end="00:54:18.480" style="s2">deeply influenced by that myself and</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.720" end="00:54:18.960" style="s2">it&#39;s what i&#39;m trying to implement here</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.480" end="00:54:20.800" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.960" end="00:54:22.319" style="s2">i think that shared cognitive grammar</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.800" end="00:54:22.880" style="s2">will be something that people can</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.319" end="00:54:26.160" style="s2">readily</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.880" end="00:54:29.839" style="s2">attach to i also think the fact that um</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.160" end="00:54:33.200" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to re-initiate people into</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.839" end="00:54:35.760" style="s2">a world based on the ideas of life</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.200" end="00:54:37.599" style="s2">and music also is helpful in that</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.760" end="00:54:38.000" style="s2">project because that is the world in</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.599" end="00:54:40.400" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.000" end="00:54:41.920" style="s2">these uh older traditions are situated</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.400" end="00:54:44.079" style="s2">right that&#39;s much more amenable to a</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.920" end="00:54:44.559" style="s2">christian world than is this mechanistic</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.079" end="00:54:46.319" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.559" end="00:54:48.400" style="s2">when we tried to fit god into that world</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.319" end="00:54:52.000" style="s2">he died yes</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.400" end="00:54:53.680" style="s2">yes so would part of the courses</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.000" end="00:54:55.760" style="s2">also be the more philosophically</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.680" end="00:54:58.640" style="s2">challenging project of taking</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.760" end="00:54:59.520" style="s2">so i mean this is analogous to the</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.640" end="00:55:01.280" style="s2">argument i&#39;ve made about</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.520" end="00:55:03.200" style="s2">psychotechnologies you adopt them for</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.280" end="00:55:05.040" style="s2">certain reasons and then they permeate</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.200" end="00:55:06.559" style="s2">and then you end up being exacted your</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.040" end="00:55:09.119" style="s2">cognition gets accepted</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.559" end="00:55:10.799" style="s2">and then your your your experience</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.119" end="00:55:11.839" style="s2">changes and then you come up with a new</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.799" end="00:55:14.559" style="s2">metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.839" end="00:55:16.160" style="s2">to try and make sense of that change</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.559" end="00:55:16.799" style="s2">like the axial revolution or something</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.160" end="00:55:18.480" style="s2">like that right</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.799" end="00:55:20.000" style="s2">is it going to be like you&#39;re inducing</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.480" end="00:55:23.040" style="s2">you&#39;re going to be inducing all this in</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.000" end="00:55:25.520" style="s2">people uh but there&#39;s still the</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.040" end="00:55:26.799" style="s2">very difficult project which not</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.520" end="00:55:29.280" style="s2">everybody has to undertake</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.799" end="00:55:31.040" style="s2">i acknowledge that right now but some</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.280" end="00:55:31.760" style="s2">people will need to and some people will</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.040" end="00:55:33.680" style="s2">want to</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.760" end="00:55:36.079" style="s2">undertake the project the philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.680" end="00:55:38.160" style="s2">project of okay i have this</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.079" end="00:55:39.280" style="s2">and then here is the this mechanistic</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.160" end="00:55:41.440" style="s2">worldview that is</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.280" end="00:55:42.559" style="s2">still wrapped up in science and certain</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.440" end="00:55:44.960" style="s2">models</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.559" end="00:55:46.799" style="s2">the philosophical project of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.960" end="00:55:48.960" style="s2">integrate and bridge between them</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.799" end="00:55:50.960" style="s2">seems like something that some people</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.960" end="00:55:54.079" style="s2">are going to want to pursue after</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.960" end="00:55:56.000" style="s2">playing the great awakening</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.079" end="00:55:57.280" style="s2">that is something that i want to work on</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.000" end="00:55:59.839" style="s2">as well</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.280" end="00:56:00.799" style="s2">so with these world views i think that</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.839" end="00:56:03.359" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.799" end="00:56:05.440" style="s2">would do well to recognize them as</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.359" end="00:56:06.079" style="s2">models as opposed to what reality</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.440" end="00:56:09.359" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.079" end="00:56:09.920" style="s2">is i think that this search to need to</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.359" end="00:56:12.559" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.920" end="00:56:14.880" style="s2">certainly what the stuff of being is is</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.559" end="00:56:17.760" style="s2">kind of a confused search</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.880" end="00:56:18.559" style="s2">we are i think always kind of at a</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.760" end="00:56:21.440" style="s2">remove</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.559" end="00:56:22.000" style="s2">from phenomena we are always translating</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.440" end="00:56:23.920" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.000" end="00:56:26.240" style="s2">into a way that makes sense to us and by</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.920" end="00:56:29.520" style="s2">doing that we are abstracting it</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.240" end="00:56:30.000" style="s2">so it it&#39;s not that the cosmos is</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.520" end="00:56:32.240" style="s2">literally</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.000" end="00:56:33.760" style="s2">like an organism or that the cosmos is</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.240" end="00:56:36.559" style="s2">literally like the machine</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.760" end="00:56:38.640" style="s2">but we can utilize different ways of</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.559" end="00:56:41.359" style="s2">relating to reality and understanding it</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.640" end="00:56:42.640" style="s2">uh to articulate it in those terms and</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.359" end="00:56:45.359" style="s2">then to act on it</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.640" end="00:56:45.680" style="s2">according to what those terms motivates</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.359" end="00:56:48.880" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.680" end="00:56:50.720" style="s2">to do right so what i really like is</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.880" end="00:56:52.079" style="s2">this object-oriented ontology framework</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.720" end="00:56:53.760" style="s2">which is also built into this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.079" end="00:56:56.640" style="s2">hydagarian view of</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.760" end="00:56:58.480" style="s2">um nature and like the the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.640" end="00:57:00.640" style="s2">to nature and so</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.480" end="00:57:01.920" style="s2">within object or objected oriented</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.640" end="00:57:05.359" style="s2">ontology um</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.920" end="00:57:06.880" style="s2">it articulates all objects as</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.359" end="00:57:08.480" style="s2">similar to like the medieval view of</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.880" end="00:57:10.000" style="s2">like these um</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.480" end="00:57:12.079" style="s2">inherent substances that are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.000" end="00:57:14.240" style="s2">beyond phenomena there&#39;s this little</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.079" end="00:57:15.760" style="s2">kernel of ineffability in everything</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.240" end="00:57:17.280" style="s2">there&#39;s always going to be something</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.760" end="00:57:19.760" style="s2">that we can&#39;t grasp</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.280" end="00:57:21.200" style="s2">and so what we&#39;re tasked with doing is</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.760" end="00:57:22.960" style="s2">establishing a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.200" end="00:57:25.040" style="s2">with that which we simply cannot know</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.960" end="00:57:28.480" style="s2">literally and so we have</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.040" end="00:57:30.880" style="s2">options we have the model of life</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.480" end="00:57:32.079" style="s2">or we have the model of mechanism and</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.880" end="00:57:34.400" style="s2">these actually map</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.079" end="00:57:36.319" style="s2">fairly well on to um right and left</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.400" end="00:57:37.119" style="s2">hemispheric processing right so if you</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.319" end="00:57:40.240" style="s2">look at the work of</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.119" end="00:57:42.000" style="s2">uh ian mcgill christ mastering emissary</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.240" end="00:57:44.640" style="s2">he goes on at length to talk about how</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.000" end="00:57:46.960" style="s2">the implicit intuitive effective</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.640" end="00:57:48.079" style="s2">processes that are more common to the</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.960" end="00:57:50.559" style="s2">right hemisphere</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.079" end="00:57:52.400" style="s2">promote a relationship to reality which</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.559" end="00:57:54.799" style="s2">is more like a relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.400" end="00:57:55.680" style="s2">a lived being and another lived being</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.799" end="00:57:57.839" style="s2">yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.680" end="00:57:59.280" style="s2">and then with the left side which has</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.839" end="00:58:00.720" style="s2">all of your language articulation</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.280" end="00:58:04.480" style="s2">functions</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.720" end="00:58:07.280" style="s2">that is much more heavily involved in</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.480" end="00:58:08.640" style="s2">tool use and tool manipulation so these</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.280" end="00:58:11.280" style="s2">two modes of uh</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.640" end="00:58:12.880" style="s2">life and lived relationship versus</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.280" end="00:58:15.760" style="s2">manipulation and mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.880" end="00:58:17.040" style="s2">map onto very basic neural cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.760" end="00:58:18.160" style="s2">parameters that we&#39;re never really going</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.040" end="00:58:19.440" style="s2">to get out of</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.160" end="00:58:21.440" style="s2">so reality is always going to be</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.440" end="00:58:23.599" style="s2">something in between these two modes and</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.440" end="00:58:25.040" style="s2">we have to be able to learn to oscillate</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.599" end="00:58:26.880" style="s2">between them flexibly</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.040" end="00:58:28.640" style="s2">and to learn when one provides the</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.880" end="00:58:30.160" style="s2">optimal relationship in this situation</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.640" end="00:58:33.119" style="s2">and when the other one does</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.160" end="00:58:34.319" style="s2">right and so educating people in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.119" end="00:58:36.480" style="s2">fact that</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.319" end="00:58:38.559" style="s2">how we understand reality is always</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.480" end="00:58:39.280" style="s2">about the participatory relationship</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.559" end="00:58:41.680" style="s2">with it</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.280" end="00:58:42.880" style="s2">and that these explicit modes are tools</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.680" end="00:58:45.599" style="s2">that we can employ</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.880" end="00:58:47.440" style="s2">i think that that will do wonders to um</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.599" end="00:58:49.359" style="s2">facilitate this integration of these</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.440" end="00:58:51.760" style="s2">modes and in line with mcgill chris</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.359" end="00:58:52.400" style="s2">i do think that it&#39;s correct to say that</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.760" end="00:58:54.960" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.400" end="00:58:56.000" style="s2">of the um sorts of things that are being</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.960" end="00:58:57.680" style="s2">processed by these</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.000" end="00:58:59.040" style="s2">hemispheric areas that that should be</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.680" end="00:59:00.799" style="s2">the master and the other should be the</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.040" end="00:59:03.359" style="s2">emissary</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.799" end="00:59:04.720" style="s2">yeah i you probably know that some of</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.359" end="00:59:06.640" style="s2">the viewers will know</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.720" end="00:59:07.920" style="s2">i had a really wonderful conversation</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.640" end="00:59:09.440" style="s2">with ian um</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.920" end="00:59:10.960" style="s2">on rebel wisdom i hope to have another</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.440" end="00:59:14.160" style="s2">one in the future um</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.960" end="00:59:16.160" style="s2">yeah i i think that&#39;s very well said um</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.160" end="00:59:17.440" style="s2">and i sort of i think of wisdom as what</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.160" end="00:59:18.880" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.440" end="00:59:21.200" style="s2">what it what one of the things wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.880" end="00:59:22.720" style="s2">should function to do is optimize the</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.200" end="00:59:25.839" style="s2">relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.720" end="00:59:27.119" style="s2">the left and right uh uh hemispheric</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.839" end="00:59:30.960" style="s2">ways of</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.119" end="00:59:33.839" style="s2">of of of constituting the agent arena</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.960" end="00:59:33.839" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.920" end="00:59:37.599" style="s2">and and that&#39;s why i think insight is</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.160" end="00:59:39.040" style="s2">such an important phenomenon because</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.599" end="00:59:41.760" style="s2">insight is a moment</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.040" end="00:59:44.240" style="s2">of reconfiguration where you get at</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.760" end="00:59:46.079" style="s2">least a momentary optimization between</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.240" end="00:59:46.720" style="s2">the right and the left hemispheres and</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.079" end="00:59:48.480" style="s2">that&#39;s why i think</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.720" end="00:59:49.839" style="s2">insight is such a central feature of</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.480" end="00:59:52.160" style="s2">wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.839" end="00:59:53.839" style="s2">so the game should be very insight</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.160" end="00:59:55.520" style="s2">provoking i hope</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.839" end="00:59:57.119" style="s2">yeah yeah absolutely insight provoking</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.520" end="00:59:58.079" style="s2">and also giving people the explicit</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.119" end="01:00:00.240" style="s2">tools</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.079" end="01:00:01.680" style="s2">to make sense of um the insights that</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.240" end="01:00:04.960" style="s2">are being evoked exactly</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.680" end="01:00:08.319" style="s2">exactly always you need both</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.960" end="01:00:11.200" style="s2">okay well um that&#39;s about our time</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.319" end="01:00:13.599" style="s2">um is there anything you&#39;d like to say</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.200" end="01:00:15.040" style="s2">something i think</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.599" end="01:00:18.000" style="s2">daniel this was you were you were</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.040" end="01:00:21.040" style="s2">extremely like just bang on today it was</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.000" end="01:00:21.760" style="s2">very eloquent uh very rich um very</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.040" end="01:00:24.319" style="s2">flowing</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.760" end="01:00:25.359" style="s2">and highly enjoyable um but i&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.319" end="01:00:28.400" style="s2">give you sort of</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.359" end="01:00:30.640" style="s2">the last word yeah um</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.400" end="01:00:32.240" style="s2">let me see geez i feel like i can tell</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.640" end="01:00:33.520" style="s2">that i was very flowy today because like</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.240" end="01:00:35.760" style="s2">it feels like it&#39;s been like 10 minutes</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.520" end="01:00:35.760" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.079" end="01:00:39.440" style="s2">uh let me see oh god what do i what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.079" end="01:00:40.839" style="s2">the last thing that i want to leave</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.440" end="01:00:43.839" style="s2">people with</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.839" end="01:00:43.839" style="s2">hmm</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.280" end="01:00:55.440" style="s2">oh yeah i&#39;m kind of at an impasse let me</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.160" end="01:00:56.480" style="s2">what&#39;s coming to me right now is this</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.440" end="01:00:57.920" style="s2">quote i&#39;ve been reading a book on</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.480" end="01:00:58.319" style="s2">krishna so i think i might just want to</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.920" end="01:01:00.240" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.319" end="01:01:03.520" style="s2">read this quote and then expand on it</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.240" end="01:01:03.520" style="s2">for like a minute okay</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.960" end="01:01:08.240" style="s2">it has to do with the importance of play</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.880" end="01:01:08.640" style="s2">and one thing that i i didn&#39;t know is</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.240" end="01:01:10.000" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.640" end="01:01:12.319" style="s2">the story of krishna is called the</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.000" end="01:01:14.000" style="s2">divine play and the metaphor of game and</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.319" end="01:01:15.040" style="s2">theater is saturated throughout the</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.000" end="01:01:18.960" style="s2">story</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.040" end="01:01:20.400" style="s2">oh yeah so it&#39;s really interesting so</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.960" end="01:01:21.440" style="s2">he&#39;s born at a time of maximal</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.400" end="01:01:24.400" style="s2">wickedness</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.440" end="01:01:25.359" style="s2">and his role is to introduce like</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.400" end="01:01:28.400" style="s2">playfulness</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.359" end="01:01:29.760" style="s2">into reality and that playfulness is</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.400" end="01:01:31.680" style="s2">what helps to</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.760" end="01:01:33.599" style="s2">alleviate the wickedness of men to</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.680" end="01:01:35.839" style="s2">overthrow the demon king</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.599" end="01:01:37.040" style="s2">um so it&#39;s it&#39;s really interesting</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.839" end="01:01:38.000" style="s2">because usually you have these kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.040" end="01:01:40.480" style="s2">like cosmic god</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.000" end="01:01:42.400" style="s2">narratives and it&#39;s like very serious</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.480" end="01:01:44.640" style="s2">right even like the christ story krishna</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.400" end="01:01:47.680" style="s2">and christ have a lot in common</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.640" end="01:01:49.359" style="s2">um but you know christ goes through this</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.680" end="01:01:52.319" style="s2">drama where he&#39;s like murdered and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.359" end="01:01:53.920" style="s2">very dramatic but for krishna he like</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.319" end="01:01:56.319" style="s2">you know steals butter and he plays</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.920" end="01:02:00.079" style="s2">music and he&#39;s like a playful little kid</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.319" end="01:02:02.079" style="s2">right right let me just where is it here</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.079" end="01:02:03.280" style="s2">uh yes so this is um i think a prayer to</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.079" end="01:02:05.200" style="s2">krishna</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.280" end="01:02:07.039" style="s2">hail to the divine child who has taken</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.200" end="01:02:08.960" style="s2">on a forum for sport</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.039" end="01:02:11.039" style="s2">seeing his playful exploits even the</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.960" end="01:02:13.520" style="s2">minds of the sirius will be swayed</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.039" end="01:02:16.480" style="s2">may that may that playful form lead me</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.520" end="01:02:18.559" style="s2">to the end of the game of life</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.480" end="01:02:20.160" style="s2">and i i&#39;ve noticed that for people that</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.559" end="01:02:22.160" style="s2">i know who have</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.160" end="01:02:23.839" style="s2">become deeply involved in in spiritual</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.160" end="01:02:25.440" style="s2">experiences utilizing psychedelic</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.839" end="01:02:27.200" style="s2">medicines and so on</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.440" end="01:02:28.960" style="s2">it&#39;s really interesting how frequently</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.200" end="01:02:30.240" style="s2">people come to the insight that life is</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.960" end="01:02:32.160" style="s2">like a game</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.240" end="01:02:34.240" style="s2">but i think you know some people will</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.160" end="01:02:35.200" style="s2">claim life is literally a game my soul</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.240" end="01:02:38.000" style="s2">chose to be</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.200" end="01:02:39.280" style="s2">incarnated in this arena for particular</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.000" end="01:02:40.640" style="s2">game purposes</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.280" end="01:02:42.000" style="s2">but i think that if we understand that</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.640" end="01:02:43.920" style="s2">as an embodied participatory</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.000" end="01:02:45.520" style="s2">relationship it is genuinely the case</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.920" end="01:02:48.960" style="s2">that life is better live</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.520" end="01:02:51.680" style="s2">if it&#39;s understood as a game right right</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.960" end="01:02:53.119" style="s2">and this seriousness you know clinging</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.680" end="01:02:55.920" style="s2">to things clinging to</p>
