<p begin="00:01:05.680" end="00:01:09.680" style="s2">of a population that actually had uh</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.000" end="00:01:13.040" style="s2">legitimate and good criticism</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.680" end="00:01:15.200" style="s2">and uh mostly around the integral left</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.040" end="00:01:17.439" style="s2">i would say and jeremy johnson was one</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.200" end="00:01:19.520" style="s2">of them and so he tweeted something out</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.439" end="00:01:20.320" style="s2">and invited him to the stoa to present</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.520" end="00:01:23.920" style="s2">his thoughts</p>

<p begin="00:01:26.560" end="00:01:29.759" style="s2">it is but it&#39;s not just a critique on</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.080" end="00:01:30.560" style="s2">the the piece that i did but a critique</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.759" end="00:01:33.360" style="s2">on the whole</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.560" end="00:01:35.280" style="s2">uh cancel culture critique from the</p>

<p begin="00:02:43.040" end="00:02:46.000" style="s2">with the video and some of the initial</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.720" end="00:02:49.760" style="s2">ideas</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.000" end="00:02:51.440" style="s2">you had sent it in a kind of a group dm</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.760" end="00:02:52.800" style="s2">and there was a lot of playful banter</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.440" end="00:02:53.440" style="s2">back and forth with the number of us who</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.800" end="00:02:57.040" style="s2">were here</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.440" end="00:03:00.800" style="s2">just about the using a metaphor of</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.040" end="00:03:04.159" style="s2">of this this sort of uh archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.800" end="00:03:07.440" style="s2">uh creepypasta style uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.159" end="00:03:09.360" style="s2">internet tulpa or being right</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.440" end="00:03:10.560" style="s2">the cancel god right and trying to</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.360" end="00:03:13.760" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.560" end="00:03:17.040" style="s2">cancel culture as a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.760" end="00:03:18.319" style="s2">theological structure of behavior um a</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.040" end="00:03:20.480" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.319" end="00:03:23.120" style="s2">capture of religious imagination maybe</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.480" end="00:03:25.840" style="s2">moving towards puritanism or</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.120" end="00:03:26.159" style="s2">mind hijacking and obviously you know i</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.840" end="00:03:29.120" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.159" end="00:03:30.319" style="s2">your own steel manning of the leftist</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.120" end="00:03:32.959" style="s2">position was actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.319" end="00:03:34.319" style="s2">quite coherent and clear enough that not</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.959" end="00:03:35.360" style="s2">too much more needs to be said about</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.319" end="00:03:37.440" style="s2">that specifically</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.360" end="00:03:39.280" style="s2">i think generally speaking folks on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.440" end="00:03:40.239" style="s2">left who did engage with you probably</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.280" end="00:03:44.000" style="s2">had</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.239" end="00:03:46.560" style="s2">similar critiques in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.000" end="00:03:48.400" style="s2">wondering who this video was for in</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.560" end="00:03:49.760" style="s2">terms of who it was addressing and how</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.400" end="00:03:53.120" style="s2">it was</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.760" end="00:03:55.439" style="s2">framing cancel culture so yes i think</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.120" end="00:03:57.599" style="s2">for people who have criticisms of cancer</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.439" end="00:03:58.400" style="s2">culture and feel that it is an outspoken</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.599" end="00:04:00.640" style="s2">phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.400" end="00:04:01.920" style="s2">that it&#39;s a real problem um i think</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.640" end="00:04:02.400" style="s2">they&#39;d see that video and probably be</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.920" end="00:04:04.959" style="s2">like okay</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.400" end="00:04:06.400" style="s2">cool for a lot of folks on the left i</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.959" end="00:04:08.000" style="s2">think there was a kind of a throwing up</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.400" end="00:04:09.840" style="s2">of hands and i&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.000" end="00:04:11.680" style="s2">there&#39;s so much more we could talk about</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.840" end="00:04:13.439" style="s2">here but rather than</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.680" end="00:04:15.040" style="s2">engage with you in that way i thought it</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.439" end="00:04:18.479" style="s2">would be fun to take that</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.040" end="00:04:21.359" style="s2">metaphor of the canceled god and</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.479" end="00:04:22.000" style="s2">flip it into a kind of gnostic metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.359" end="00:04:23.199" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.000" end="00:04:25.759" style="s2">and that was part of our initial</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.199" end="00:04:26.880" style="s2">exchange that the canceled god is really</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.759" end="00:04:29.040" style="s2">a demiurge</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.880" end="00:04:30.080" style="s2">right of some kind of deeper and i wrote</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.040" end="00:04:33.919" style="s2">this in my</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.080" end="00:04:37.360" style="s2">in my article a kind of uh catholic</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.919" end="00:04:39.840" style="s2">uh um neoliberalism right that there is</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.360" end="00:04:41.520" style="s2">a sort of substrata a sort of negative</p>

<p begin="00:04:41.520" end="00:04:47.360" style="s2">that this particular social behavior</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.800" end="00:04:48.560" style="s2">is a part of right and if we really want</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.360" end="00:04:50.720" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.560" end="00:04:52.000" style="s2">borrowing that religious metaphor in</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.720" end="00:04:55.040" style="s2">some sense uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.000" end="00:04:58.240" style="s2">transcend cancel culture or</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.040" end="00:05:00.240" style="s2">address in a really substantive way</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.240" end="00:05:03.199" style="s2">the cultural polemics that are occurring</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.240" end="00:05:05.520" style="s2">right now we need to actually go</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.199" end="00:05:08.240" style="s2">beyond that demiurge right or trace that</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.520" end="00:05:11.120" style="s2">demiurge into some deeper substratum</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.240" end="00:05:13.120" style="s2">that is that has produced it right so</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.120" end="00:05:15.280" style="s2">using that metaphor playfully</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.120" end="00:05:16.960" style="s2">i took that as an opportunity to go okay</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.280" end="00:05:18.560" style="s2">so we have</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.960" end="00:05:20.320" style="s2">especially in the intellectual dark web</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.560" end="00:05:23.919" style="s2">especially in a lot of circles</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.320" end="00:05:24.880" style="s2">um that recently even in terms of like</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.919" end="00:05:26.800" style="s2">leftist</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.880" end="00:05:28.960" style="s2">liberals have been critiquing cancer</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.800" end="00:05:32.080" style="s2">culture there&#39;s a kind of um</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.960" end="00:05:33.360" style="s2">uh the onus is on cancel culture right</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.080" end="00:05:35.520" style="s2">the onus is on</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.360" end="00:05:37.280" style="s2">as ken wilber talks about mean green</p>

<p begin="00:11:17.600" end="00:11:20.959" style="s2">um and we see a kind of pivot of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.839" end="00:11:23.600" style="s2">left from a labor</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.959" end="00:11:25.200" style="s2">left which had an intersection of of</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.600" end="00:11:28.240" style="s2">class and race</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.200" end="00:11:30.480" style="s2">to a a move into</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.240" end="00:11:31.279" style="s2">more of this fighting in the culture war</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.480" end="00:11:33.279" style="s2">right so</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.279" end="00:11:35.600" style="s2">there&#39;s obviously been an impotency in</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.279" end="00:11:38.000" style="s2">the left in terms of class politics</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.600" end="00:11:39.600" style="s2">and labor um and a lot of this has been</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.000" end="00:11:41.600" style="s2">redirected towards culture</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.600" end="00:11:42.880" style="s2">and there&#39;s been some tremendous gains</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.600" end="00:11:43.440" style="s2">in that and i think this is sort of what</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.880" end="00:11:46.480" style="s2">i mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.440" end="00:11:47.519" style="s2">in the article as well is that um this</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.480" end="00:11:50.399" style="s2">is not to</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.519" end="00:11:51.360" style="s2">say that wokeness or fighting in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.399" end="00:11:53.760" style="s2">culture war</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.360" end="00:11:55.839" style="s2">that is that has become increasingly and</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.760" end="00:11:56.639" style="s2">problematically separated from class</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.839" end="00:12:00.560" style="s2">struggle</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.639" end="00:12:00.800" style="s2">is somehow a lesser form of the left i</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.560" end="00:12:02.880" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.800" end="00:12:04.720" style="s2">no i think i think the gains have been</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.880" end="00:12:06.880" style="s2">genuinely positive and i think the</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.720" end="00:12:08.959" style="s2">internet and digital culture has enabled</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.880" end="00:12:10.880" style="s2">us to some degree to</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.959" end="00:12:12.240" style="s2">make those gains in a way we hadn&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.880" end="00:12:13.760" style="s2">able to before</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.240" end="00:12:15.920" style="s2">but now i think and especially we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.760" end="00:12:17.839" style="s2">seen in the past four to five years</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.920" end="00:12:19.440" style="s2">a tremendous awakening of the left and a</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.839" end="00:12:21.040" style="s2">lot of questions about well</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.440" end="00:12:22.399" style="s2">if we have no class consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.040" end="00:12:23.120" style="s2">anymore if there is no labor</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.399" end="00:12:24.959" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.120" end="00:12:26.880" style="s2">if that is still eroded how do we</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.959" end="00:12:29.920" style="s2">actually gain traction in movements like</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.880" end="00:12:32.720" style="s2">black lives matter recently right so</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.920" end="00:12:33.760" style="s2">i think we&#39;re looking at a a need to</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.720" end="00:12:37.120" style="s2">synthesize</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.760" end="00:12:39.279" style="s2">both this is again a gross</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.120" end="00:12:41.279" style="s2">simplification of the woke left and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.279" end="00:12:44.000" style="s2">class oriented left</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.279" end="00:12:45.120" style="s2">synthesize these two forces bring them</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.000" end="00:12:47.600" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.120" end="00:12:48.240" style="s2">if there&#39;s any critique i think in terms</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.600" end="00:12:50.639" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.240" end="00:12:52.720" style="s2">wokeness on the internet right in a sort</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.639" end="00:12:54.880" style="s2">of hyper-vigilant wokeness that</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.720" end="00:12:56.000" style="s2">people have been i think appropriately</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.880" end="00:12:59.120" style="s2">concerned about</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.000" end="00:13:00.320" style="s2">i i believe this kind of problem would</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.120" end="00:13:02.720" style="s2">be ameliorated</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.320" end="00:13:04.399" style="s2">if we began to focus more on actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.720" end="00:13:07.680" style="s2">gaining economic and social</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.399" end="00:13:09.200" style="s2">legal structural power right not just</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.680" end="00:13:11.760" style="s2">institutional power not just</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.200" end="00:13:13.839" style="s2">representation in ceo boards not just</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.760" end="00:13:15.040" style="s2">political correctness in corporations</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.839" end="00:13:17.200" style="s2">and representation</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.040" end="00:13:19.279" style="s2">but actual structural systemic and</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.200" end="00:13:21.680" style="s2">economic redistribution</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.279" end="00:13:23.120" style="s2">um that is the kind of power that really</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.680" end="00:13:25.120" style="s2">needs to be re</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.120" end="00:13:26.880" style="s2">reintroduced in the left and i think</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.120" end="00:13:29.120" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to figure that out right</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.880" end="00:13:30.800" style="s2">so i think those are the two very</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.120" end="00:13:34.000" style="s2">important layers here</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.800" end="00:13:35.279" style="s2">that need to be developed</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.000" end="00:13:36.880" style="s2">as a competency if we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.279" end="00:13:38.880" style="s2">critique the left if we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.880" end="00:13:40.000" style="s2">critique cancel culture and wokeness we</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.880" end="00:13:42.560" style="s2">have to see</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.000" end="00:13:45.199" style="s2">what it stems from we have to see that</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.560" end="00:13:47.920" style="s2">perhaps some of its over exaggerations</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.199" end="00:13:48.800" style="s2">and hyper vigilance have been a result</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.920" end="00:13:50.720" style="s2">of this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.800" end="00:13:52.240" style="s2">impotency for actual structural</p>

<p begin="00:13:52.240" end="00:13:56.320" style="s2">um and then as i mentioned in that tweet</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.320" end="00:13:59.199" style="s2">thread too right like</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.320" end="00:13:59.760" style="s2">in terms of the culture wars it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.199" end="00:14:02.720" style="s2">left</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.760" end="00:14:04.639" style="s2">you know may have symbolically dominated</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.720" end="00:14:06.480" style="s2">the conversation but</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.639" end="00:14:08.079" style="s2">they haven&#39;t actually won the culture</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.480" end="00:14:10.880" style="s2">war like ideologically</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.079" end="00:14:12.399" style="s2">economically we are still functioning</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.880" end="00:14:15.440" style="s2">and perhaps even more so</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.399" end="00:14:17.199" style="s2">on the right than we ever have before so</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.440" end="00:14:19.920" style="s2">you know i think we have to really kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.199" end="00:14:22.079" style="s2">of make some important distinctions here</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.920" end="00:14:23.120" style="s2">about what actually is going on with the</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.079" end="00:14:25.040" style="s2">culture war</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.120" end="00:14:27.120" style="s2">what the historical analysis the</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.040" end="00:14:28.240" style="s2">material historical analysis right of</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.120" end="00:14:30.639" style="s2">class politics</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.240" end="00:14:31.519" style="s2">can inform us about that uh that</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.639" end="00:14:34.000" style="s2">frustration</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.519" end="00:14:35.600" style="s2">how that is also doubly right on the</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.000" end="00:14:37.680" style="s2">other end has fueled</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.600" end="00:14:39.680" style="s2">a lot of the reactionary politics that</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.680" end="00:14:40.800" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen crop up over the past 10</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.680" end="00:14:42.959" style="s2">years or so</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.800" end="00:14:44.720" style="s2">with increasing austerity and increasing</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.959" end="00:14:45.360" style="s2">loss of labor in the united states et</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.720" end="00:14:48.560" style="s2">cetera or</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.360" end="00:14:50.399" style="s2">abroad so there&#39;s a lot to go in here</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.560" end="00:14:52.399" style="s2">but this is why the left analysis has</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.399" end="00:14:54.320" style="s2">really needed to be integrated right</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.399" end="00:14:56.959" style="s2">like let&#39;s subsume</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.320" end="00:14:57.920" style="s2">um what the left has to say about class</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.959" end="00:14:59.519" style="s2">and race and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.920" end="00:15:01.120" style="s2">intersectionality of those things and</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.519" end="00:15:03.839" style="s2">the history of those things</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.120" end="00:15:05.920" style="s2">before we take down a straw man about</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.839" end="00:15:08.480" style="s2">okay wokeness is the real problem</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.920" end="00:15:09.600" style="s2">there&#39;s these deeper historical forces</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.480" end="00:15:14.240" style="s2">that are</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.600" end="00:15:16.639" style="s2">um to strongly use the word producing</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.240" end="00:15:18.000" style="s2">some of this cultural fragmentation</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.639" end="00:15:19.680" style="s2">neoliberalism</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.000" end="00:15:22.240" style="s2">and really like this is again where the</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.680" end="00:15:25.760" style="s2">class analysis comes in and we we know</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.240" end="00:15:28.320" style="s2">that the ideology of our economic system</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.760" end="00:15:29.440" style="s2">is extractive it&#39;s atomizing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.320" end="00:15:31.680" style="s2">segmenting</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.440" end="00:15:33.920" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s unidirectional is one</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.680" end="00:15:37.279" style="s2">directional in terms of growth right</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.920" end="00:15:38.160" style="s2">um this process of of globalization</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.279" end="00:15:40.480" style="s2">which we have seen</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.160" end="00:15:42.560" style="s2">sort of hijacked economics over the past</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.480" end="00:15:44.560" style="s2">30 40 years with neoliberalism</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.560" end="00:15:46.240" style="s2">is part of the reason why we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.560" end="00:15:46.720" style="s2">this massive cultural breakdown right</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.240" end="00:15:48.720" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.720" end="00:15:50.560" style="s2">and we might say that&#39;s not enough we</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.720" end="00:15:53.199" style="s2">might say that there needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.560" end="00:15:55.120" style="s2">an integral or a meta modern or a</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.199" end="00:15:56.800" style="s2">systemic turn and say no no the problem</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.120" end="00:15:57.759" style="s2">isn&#39;t just neoliberalism it&#39;s the whole</p>

<p begin="00:15:57.759" end="00:16:01.440" style="s2">we need a game b et cetera i think</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.160" end="00:16:04.480" style="s2">that&#39;s fine but</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.440" end="00:16:06.560" style="s2">without this material analysis as one of</p>

<p begin="00:16:08.399" end="00:16:11.600" style="s2">be able to do much right if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.000" end="00:16:13.920" style="s2">have a literacy about</p>

<p begin="00:16:39.920" end="00:16:42.880" style="s2">then we&#39;re not going to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.360" end="00:16:43.759" style="s2">really see through some of these</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.880" end="00:16:45.759" style="s2">processes</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.759" end="00:16:47.199" style="s2">that need to be ameliorated and the left</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.759" end="00:16:48.240" style="s2">is an ally and i guess that&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.199" end="00:16:49.839" style="s2">that i was</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.240" end="00:16:51.279" style="s2">kind of concluding in those first two</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.839" end="00:16:54.399" style="s2">sections the left becomes an</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.279" end="00:16:56.959" style="s2">ally here if we can take that theory and</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.399" end="00:16:58.079" style="s2">and wield it right use that analysis</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.959" end="00:17:01.279" style="s2">appropriately</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.079" end="00:17:03.440" style="s2">to work towards solutions to maybe</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.279" end="00:17:04.880" style="s2">create alternative platforms on social</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.440" end="00:17:07.360" style="s2">media to</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.880" end="00:17:08.079" style="s2">amplify certain experimental economic</p>

<p begin="00:17:08.079" end="00:17:12.400" style="s2">and etc so this is not to say everyone</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.799" end="00:17:13.839" style="s2">needs to become leftist i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.400" end="00:17:17.919" style="s2">just to say that</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.839" end="00:17:18.720" style="s2">leftism in theory and practice has a lot</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.919" end="00:17:21.439" style="s2">to teach us</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.720" end="00:17:22.720" style="s2">right there&#39;s a lot to integrate for</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.439" end="00:17:24.559" style="s2">folks who are more interested in</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.720" end="00:17:28.000" style="s2">experimenting with</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.559" end="00:17:30.720" style="s2">new paradigms and new models um</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.000" end="00:17:33.120" style="s2">so the deeper they perhaps the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.720" end="00:17:34.320" style="s2">the the finer final layer here at least</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.120" end="00:17:37.840" style="s2">in the article</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.320" end="00:17:39.360" style="s2">is taking this to the deeper substratum</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.840" end="00:17:41.760" style="s2">the deeper cathodic</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.360" end="00:17:43.120" style="s2">elements which have more to do with i</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.760" end="00:17:44.960" style="s2">think what we&#39;re interested in</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.120" end="00:17:46.320" style="s2">in a lot of the consciousness culture</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.960" end="00:17:47.679" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.320" end="00:17:49.919" style="s2">consciousness studies which is</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.679" end="00:17:53.120" style="s2">phenomenology which is</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.919" end="00:17:55.280" style="s2">what what is the ontology that produces</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.120" end="00:17:56.240" style="s2">these forces of colonialism and</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.280" end="00:17:58.880" style="s2">capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.240" end="00:18:00.799" style="s2">or as as some folks have popularized the</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.880" end="00:18:04.080" style="s2">phrase the capital low scene</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.799" end="00:18:04.720" style="s2">what is the sense-making orientation</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.080" end="00:18:07.840" style="s2">that our</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.720" end="00:18:10.160" style="s2">culture has produced and inhabits</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.840" end="00:18:11.679" style="s2">that is able to bring that form of</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.160" end="00:18:14.080" style="s2">economic ideology</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.679" end="00:18:15.039" style="s2">material social policy et cetera and</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.080" end="00:18:17.280" style="s2">enact it</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.039" end="00:18:18.720" style="s2">right and then how can we overcome that</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.280" end="00:18:21.360" style="s2">in ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.720" end="00:18:23.600" style="s2">in that very true kind of subjective</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.360" end="00:18:25.760" style="s2">sense that phenomenological sense</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.600" end="00:18:27.440" style="s2">to be able to imagine different</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.760" end="00:18:30.320" style="s2">possibilities in the world</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.440" end="00:18:31.840" style="s2">to enable ourselves to think both media</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.320" end="00:18:33.840" style="s2">ecologically and to see these</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.840" end="00:18:37.120" style="s2">environmental historical pressures</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.840" end="00:18:38.400" style="s2">but not be reductive which i admit it is</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.120" end="00:18:41.200" style="s2">a leftist i think there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.400" end="00:18:44.960" style="s2">reductionism and anti-spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.200" end="00:18:46.880" style="s2">to see that those um those insights are</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.960" end="00:18:48.320" style="s2">equally as important for overcoming</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.880" end="00:18:49.679" style="s2">capitalism and imagining a</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.320" end="00:18:52.720" style="s2">post-capitalist future</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.679" end="00:18:54.240" style="s2">right so those are the three kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.720" end="00:18:57.200" style="s2">literacies we have</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.240" end="00:18:58.960" style="s2">again the market social media literacy</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.200" end="00:19:01.200" style="s2">neoliberalism as a literacy</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.960" end="00:19:02.480" style="s2">just sort of the history of that the</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.200" end="00:19:06.080" style="s2">forces that have shaped</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.480" end="00:19:08.240" style="s2">the contemporary day and age and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.080" end="00:19:09.440" style="s2">the deeper history the history of</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.240" end="00:19:12.400" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.440" end="00:19:14.000" style="s2">in terms of how sense making has evolved</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.400" end="00:19:15.440" style="s2">through cultural evolution to bring us</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.000" end="00:19:16.960" style="s2">to where we are today</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.440" end="00:19:18.720" style="s2">and i would say my final point about</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.960" end="00:19:20.080" style="s2">that i have some differences about</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.720" end="00:19:22.559" style="s2">wilbur because i think wilbur</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.080" end="00:19:24.160" style="s2">in a post-truth world and a lot of his</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.559" end="00:19:27.760" style="s2">analysis has been</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.160" end="00:19:30.720" style="s2">on um just just not sufficiently</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.760" end="00:19:32.559" style="s2">his theory hasn&#39;t been sufficiently used</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.720" end="00:19:34.240" style="s2">to comment on what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.559" end="00:19:35.600" style="s2">because he makes the same mistake he</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.240" end="00:19:37.919" style="s2">blames it on mean</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.600" end="00:19:39.280" style="s2">green meme as the leading the bleeding</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.919" end="00:19:42.160" style="s2">edge pathology</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.280" end="00:19:43.840" style="s2">that&#39;s causing all of these problems um</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.160" end="00:19:47.039" style="s2">i will quickly mention</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.840" end="00:19:48.080" style="s2">that i think of a more appropriate use</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.039" end="00:19:50.640" style="s2">of his model</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.080" end="00:19:53.600" style="s2">would be to situate a lot of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.640" end="00:19:55.520" style="s2">going on not in the pathologies of green</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.600" end="00:19:57.120" style="s2">but a sort of arrested development</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.520" end="00:19:58.559" style="s2">that&#39;s free for those who aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.120" end="00:20:00.480" style="s2">familiar with the terminology green is</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.559" end="00:20:03.360" style="s2">like progressive it&#39;s leftist</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.480" end="00:20:04.720" style="s2">you know uh there&#39;s an arrested</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.360" end="00:20:08.080" style="s2">development at amber</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.720" end="00:20:10.400" style="s2">or orange or modernistic stage for him</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.080" end="00:20:12.400" style="s2">and what we really need to see is the</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.400" end="00:20:16.240" style="s2">center of gravity moving more</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.400" end="00:20:18.720" style="s2">into green the the kind of things that</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.240" end="00:20:20.640" style="s2">amber used to do or modernism used to do</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.720" end="00:20:23.360" style="s2">in terms of economics etc</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.640" end="00:20:24.080" style="s2">that have been left alone for that stage</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.360" end="00:20:25.520" style="s2">to do</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.080" end="00:20:28.080" style="s2">need to move their center of gravity</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.520" end="00:20:29.840" style="s2">into green like economics needs to be a</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.080" end="00:20:32.080" style="s2">green thing green thing isn&#39;t just peace</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.840" end="00:20:34.640" style="s2">and love and everybody&#39;s got to be equal</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.080" end="00:20:36.480" style="s2">green is let us innovate economic and</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.640" end="00:20:38.799" style="s2">social systems for better equity</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.480" end="00:20:41.120" style="s2">and more resilience on the planet right</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.799" end="00:20:44.080" style="s2">so green needs to kind of come of</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.120" end="00:20:45.200" style="s2">age in that sense but amber is present</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.080" end="00:20:47.520" style="s2">preventing that</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.200" end="00:20:48.799" style="s2">and i think in many senses that is why</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.520" end="00:20:50.640" style="s2">we see</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.799" end="00:20:52.720" style="s2">i&#39;m sorry i&#39;m using amber i think i mean</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.640" end="00:20:53.840" style="s2">orange i&#39;m sorry the colors mixed they</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.720" end="00:20:57.520" style="s2">used to be different</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.840" end="00:21:00.080" style="s2">but modernism the modernistic stage</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.520" end="00:21:02.000" style="s2">is holding everyone hostage we have the</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.080" end="00:21:05.120" style="s2">reactionary pre-modern</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.000" end="00:21:07.120" style="s2">sort of mythical entrenchment and then</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.120" end="00:21:07.760" style="s2">we have the reactionary hyper-vigilant</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.120" end="00:21:10.000" style="s2">green</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.760" end="00:21:10.960" style="s2">but in the center is this center of</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.000" end="00:21:12.720" style="s2">gravity</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.960" end="00:21:14.720" style="s2">which takes the longest to change right</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.720" end="00:21:19.240" style="s2">economics legal systems</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.720" end="00:21:22.320" style="s2">civilizations this is the the the most</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.240" end="00:21:24.960" style="s2">coagulated crystallized</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.320" end="00:21:26.799" style="s2">i don&#39;t know what better word exfoliated</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.960" end="00:21:29.120" style="s2">expression of consciousness like this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.799" end="00:21:32.480" style="s2">this is it becoming a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.120" end="00:21:34.000" style="s2">material environment for us right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.480" end="00:21:36.159" style="s2">the hardest to overcome</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.000" end="00:21:37.440" style="s2">it&#39;s the hardest to transform and i</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.159" end="00:21:38.720" style="s2">think that is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.440" end="00:21:41.919" style="s2">arresting everyone else and</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.720" end="00:21:45.919" style="s2">pathologizing these these two</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.919" end="00:21:49.360" style="s2">wielding um memetic oscillations between</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.919" end="00:21:52.480" style="s2">mythic and then postmodern or green so</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.360" end="00:21:53.360" style="s2">that&#39;s just the wilbur analysis if we</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.480" end="00:21:56.720" style="s2">move again</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.360" end="00:21:59.360" style="s2">this is where i&#39;m coming from into</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.720" end="00:22:01.360" style="s2">a sort of gebsarian analysis which looks</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.360" end="00:22:02.480" style="s2">more at cultural phenomenology it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.360" end="00:22:06.400" style="s2">a stage centered</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.480" end="00:22:09.039" style="s2">we still have this deep insight about um</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.400" end="00:22:11.039" style="s2">not just neoliberalism but if we look at</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.039" end="00:22:13.440" style="s2">the kind of phenomena that most of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.039" end="00:22:16.640" style="s2">left from like mark fisher&#39;s acid</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.440" end="00:22:18.720" style="s2">acid communism and capitalist realism</p>

<p begin="00:22:44.559" end="00:22:48.400" style="s2">of modernity sort of beginning with this</p>

<p begin="00:22:48.400" end="00:22:52.320" style="s2">um this atomization this ability or</p>

<p begin="00:22:52.320" end="00:22:56.559" style="s2">and to break forth out of that mythical</p>

<p begin="00:22:56.559" end="00:22:59.840" style="s2">of the unperspective or the pre-modern</p>

<p begin="00:22:59.840" end="00:23:03.360" style="s2">that&#39;s great to be able to do that to</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.080" end="00:23:06.080" style="s2">make those measurements to</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.360" end="00:23:08.080" style="s2">spatialize time to explore the</p>

<p begin="00:23:17.120" end="00:23:20.640" style="s2">he says we need to move into this</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.480" end="00:23:22.000" style="s2">integral mode of being in the world a</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.640" end="00:23:24.640" style="s2">different ontology and a different</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.000" end="00:23:26.480" style="s2">phenomenology but until we do what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.640" end="00:23:27.200" style="s2">going to see and i think we see this</p>

<p begin="00:23:27.200" end="00:23:31.200" style="s2">and this is how i&#39;m looping it back to</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.799" end="00:23:32.080" style="s2">the bulk culture and the cancel culture</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.200" end="00:23:35.360" style="s2">et cetera</p>

<p begin="00:23:36.240" end="00:23:41.279" style="s2">um is for the time being still</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.440" end="00:23:42.559" style="s2">captured by the perspective of a world</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.279" end="00:23:44.640" style="s2">that atomization</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.559" end="00:23:45.600" style="s2">like epster was writing this in 1949 he</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.640" end="00:23:48.559" style="s2">was saying you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.600" end="00:23:50.080" style="s2">um atomization is increasing there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.559" end="00:23:52.240" style="s2">going to be basically a war</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.080" end="00:23:54.000" style="s2">of all against all nobody&#39;s perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.240" end="00:23:55.520" style="s2">will be able to jive with anybody else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.000" end="00:23:56.480" style="s2">perspectives there&#39;s everything is</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.520" end="00:23:58.880" style="s2">there&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.480" end="00:24:00.080" style="s2">cultural breakdown right cultural</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.880" end="00:24:01.760" style="s2">atomization</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.080" end="00:24:04.559" style="s2">that&#39;s the end point that&#39;s sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.760" end="00:24:05.120" style="s2">death expression of the perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.559" end="00:24:07.679" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.120" end="00:24:08.760" style="s2">and he saw that as sort of the an ever</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.679" end="00:24:11.039" style="s2">increasing</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.760" end="00:24:12.240" style="s2">intensification of that in our cultural</p>

<p begin="00:24:12.240" end="00:24:15.760" style="s2">that it would become increasingly</p>

<p begin="00:24:15.760" end="00:24:22.480" style="s2">to cross these bridges so i think</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.360" end="00:24:24.720" style="s2">to pause and sort of conclude here</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.480" end="00:24:26.080" style="s2">what we really need perhaps is an</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.720" end="00:24:28.400" style="s2">integral left</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.080" end="00:24:29.200" style="s2">a left that understands the criticisms</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.400" end="00:24:32.240" style="s2">that in</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.200" end="00:24:34.480" style="s2">integrates the material analysis that</p>

<p begin="00:24:34.480" end="00:24:37.760" style="s2">and intersectionality can offer us but</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.200" end="00:24:40.159" style="s2">doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.760" end="00:24:42.000" style="s2">stop there necessarily it adds and</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.159" end="00:24:43.279" style="s2">introduces this deeper cultural</p>

<p begin="00:24:43.279" end="00:24:46.720" style="s2">in the the becoming of consciousness to</p>

<p begin="00:24:51.919" end="00:24:55.559" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.799" end="00:24:57.200" style="s2">imagine the possible and how do we</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.559" end="00:25:00.080" style="s2">countervail</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.200" end="00:25:02.880" style="s2">a culture a neoliberal culture of hyper</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.080" end="00:25:04.960" style="s2">atomization and fragmentation well</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.880" end="00:25:06.559" style="s2">zack stein says we get offline we we</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.960" end="00:25:08.159" style="s2">meet each other face to face maybe</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.559" end="00:25:10.000" style="s2">that&#39;s hard right now</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.159" end="00:25:12.000" style="s2">but there are other ways we can do this</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.000" end="00:25:15.600" style="s2">right there are other ways like</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.000" end="00:25:18.559" style="s2">chilhan talks about um cultivating the</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.600" end="00:25:19.520" style="s2">via contemplativa in terms of becoming</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.559" end="00:25:21.200" style="s2">more present</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.520" end="00:25:23.919" style="s2">this is essentially what gepster</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.200" end="00:25:26.320" style="s2">suggests as this sort of radical act of</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.919" end="00:25:28.720" style="s2">becoming truly open to the present</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.320" end="00:25:30.320" style="s2">and to each other in empathy and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.720" end="00:25:33.279" style="s2">complexity of the present</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.320" end="00:25:34.640" style="s2">now this allows us to in some sense to</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.279" end="00:25:37.919" style="s2">overcome these</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.640" end="00:25:40.400" style="s2">social material economic and also um</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.919" end="00:25:42.080" style="s2">uh consciousness oriented crises that</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.400" end="00:25:44.320" style="s2">are manifesting right now in both the</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.080" end="00:25:46.720" style="s2">meaning crisis and the meta crisis</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.320" end="00:25:48.880" style="s2">um so i would say like the an integral</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.720" end="00:25:50.559" style="s2">left begins there somewhere it begins</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.880" end="00:25:54.400" style="s2">with our ability to</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.559" end="00:25:57.039" style="s2">become more present um to not</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.400" end="00:25:59.039" style="s2">um to have equanimity towards our</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.039" end="00:26:02.080" style="s2">allergies if we really feel</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.039" end="00:26:04.000" style="s2">like the left is is um we feel kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.080" end="00:26:05.760" style="s2">reactionary or don&#39;t want to touch</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.000" end="00:26:07.679" style="s2">leftist theory i think we have to i</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.760" end="00:26:10.320" style="s2">think we really have to move into it</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.679" end="00:26:11.600" style="s2">but do it in a way that is this more</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.320" end="00:26:14.799" style="s2">equanimous</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.600" end="00:26:16.000" style="s2">present and imminent attitude and when</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.799" end="00:26:18.720" style="s2">we do that i think</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.000" end="00:26:20.240" style="s2">you know at least individually we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.720" end="00:26:23.360" style="s2">overcome</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.240" end="00:26:26.640" style="s2">a culture of atomization if not</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.360" end="00:26:28.159" style="s2">culturally right i think um it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.640" end="00:26:30.080" style="s2">then we begin to cohere what the</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.159" end="00:26:31.679" style="s2">integral world looks like or what</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.080" end="00:26:34.799" style="s2">integrative thinking</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.679" end="00:26:36.880" style="s2">or what um what the world after hyper</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.799" end="00:26:39.840" style="s2">fragmentation atomization looks like if</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.880" end="00:26:42.159" style="s2">we can begin to live that in the present</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.840" end="00:26:43.919" style="s2">that is really our only shot that is</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.159" end="00:26:46.720" style="s2">really our only chance</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.919" end="00:26:47.600" style="s2">um so that&#39;s sort of my my whole my</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.720" end="00:26:50.640" style="s2">whole spiel</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.600" end="00:26:52.400" style="s2">right those three main points um</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.640" end="00:26:54.799" style="s2">and we can we can open it up here and we</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.400" end="00:26:57.760" style="s2">can we can start</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.799" end="00:26:59.120" style="s2">dancing very cool yeah that was awesome</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.760" end="00:27:00.960" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.120" end="00:27:02.640" style="s2">so if you have any questions for jeremy</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.960" end="00:27:03.760" style="s2">put him in the chat now just indicate</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.640" end="00:27:05.200" style="s2">highly question</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.760" end="00:27:06.559" style="s2">in front of your question so i can like</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.200" end="00:27:07.360" style="s2">you know determine if it&#39;s a question or</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.559" end="00:27:09.919" style="s2">statement</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.360" end="00:27:10.799" style="s2">um so i&#39;ll start off with one question</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.919" end="00:27:12.720" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.799" end="00:27:14.159" style="s2">i&#39;ll actually kind of talk about the the</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.720" end="00:27:14.960" style="s2">cancer culture piece a little bit that</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.159" end="00:27:16.880" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.960" end="00:27:18.480" style="s2">inspired this this talk and then that</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.880" end="00:27:21.039" style="s2">will lead into a question</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.480" end="00:27:21.919" style="s2">um so somebody earlier in the chat said</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.039" end="00:27:24.080" style="s2">what is the</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.919" end="00:27:25.679" style="s2">like a a right version or conservative</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.080" end="00:27:27.120" style="s2">version of cancel culture</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.679" end="00:27:28.799" style="s2">and so just to kind of give you how the</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.120" end="00:27:29.200" style="s2">sausage was made of that cancel that</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.799" end="00:27:30.720" style="s2">piece</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.200" end="00:27:32.559" style="s2">well for first people haven&#39;t read it it</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.720" end="00:27:33.039" style="s2">was a short like a thousand word kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.559" end="00:27:35.120" style="s2">essay</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.039" end="00:27:36.480" style="s2">and high existence then rebel wisdom did</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.120" end="00:27:37.760" style="s2">a short video on it</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.480" end="00:27:39.600" style="s2">the idea there is that through the</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.760" end="00:27:40.159" style="s2">culture of cancellation and i use that</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.600" end="00:27:41.760" style="s2">word</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.159" end="00:27:44.799" style="s2">uh specifically well i&#39;ll say that in a</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.760" end="00:27:45.919" style="s2">moment why uh a god emerge and now is to</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.799" end="00:27:47.120" style="s2">god emerge that</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.919" end="00:27:48.399" style="s2">wants to make everyone afraid to</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.120" end="00:27:48.960" style="s2">actually talk and then if everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.399" end="00:27:51.360" style="s2">afraid</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.960" end="00:27:53.039" style="s2">uh to talk then everyone&#39;s at jeopardy</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.360" end="00:27:54.559" style="s2">we&#39;re at risk of the medic crisis and</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.039" end="00:27:56.000" style="s2">going extinct as a species that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.559" end="00:27:58.640" style="s2">general idea</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.000" end="00:27:59.600" style="s2">um so how the sausage was made there</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.640" end="00:28:01.520" style="s2">originally</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.600" end="00:28:03.200" style="s2">i i was making the argument that every</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.520" end="00:28:04.720" style="s2">memetic tribe whether from left or right</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.200" end="00:28:06.000" style="s2">has their own version of a canceled</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.720" end="00:28:06.399" style="s2">culture there&#39;s an in-group and an out</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.000" end="00:28:09.600" style="s2">group</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.399" end="00:28:11.279" style="s2">and through that that that god emerged</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.600" end="00:28:12.880" style="s2">but the first essay people didn&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.279" end="00:28:14.159" style="s2">it has two nuances and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.880" end="00:28:15.760" style="s2">mythological there&#39;s a second essay they</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.159" end="00:28:17.039" style="s2">didn&#39;t like a third essay then</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.760" end="00:28:18.320" style="s2">through all that then like you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.039" end="00:28:19.039" style="s2">getting exhausted just wanting to get</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.320" end="00:28:21.279" style="s2">out there</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.039" end="00:28:23.039" style="s2">cut a lot of stuff so propositionally</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.279" end="00:28:24.399" style="s2">yeah it looked like the finger was being</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.039" end="00:28:26.799" style="s2">pointed at uh sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.399" end="00:28:28.640" style="s2">the woke social justice mean green meme</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.799" end="00:28:29.919" style="s2">which was not my original intention but</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.640" end="00:28:33.120" style="s2">it is something that</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.919" end="00:28:34.399" style="s2">i did right and then the the rebel</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.120" end="00:28:35.520" style="s2">wisdom piece was like three over three</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.399" end="00:28:37.360" style="s2">hours of filming cut down to five</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.520" end="00:28:40.720" style="s2">minutes a lot of nuance was cut</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.360" end="00:28:41.360" style="s2">so i understand how it did read like</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.720" end="00:28:43.200" style="s2">that and</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.360" end="00:28:45.679" style="s2">as jeremy said in the newsletter i said</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.200" end="00:28:47.360" style="s2">yeah this is ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.679" end="00:28:49.039" style="s2">was didn&#39;t serve as this kind of super</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.360" end="00:28:50.080" style="s2">ordinary meme that i was hoping for is</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.039" end="00:28:50.559" style="s2">just going to get collapsed into</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.080" end="00:28:52.559" style="s2">cultural</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.559" end="00:28:54.080" style="s2">argument and this was the case so a guy</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.559" end="00:28:55.840" style="s2">like mike cernovich retweeted it and a</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.080" end="00:28:57.200" style="s2">bunch of like make-a-goons were tweeting</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.840" end="00:29:00.960" style="s2">this i&#39;m like oh god</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.200" end="00:29:03.760" style="s2">um so i did uh admit confess to that</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.960" end="00:29:05.600" style="s2">um so but that being said and you said i</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.760" end="00:29:07.600" style="s2">still manda left this approach i think i</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.600" end="00:29:08.799" style="s2">i agreed with it i didn&#39;t understand i</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.600" end="00:29:11.200" style="s2">agreed with it uh in</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.799" end="00:29:12.159" style="s2">the newsletter so my first question to</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.200" end="00:29:14.960" style="s2">you uh</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.159" end="00:29:16.799" style="s2">this this talk was called transcending</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.960" end="00:29:18.080" style="s2">the cancel culture critique</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.799" end="00:29:19.679" style="s2">and uh you know when people hear</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.080" end="00:29:21.120" style="s2">transcending or at least the wilbur it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.679" end="00:29:24.000" style="s2">like transcendent conclude</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.120" end="00:29:25.440" style="s2">let&#39;s include a certain the good of of</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.000" end="00:29:26.799" style="s2">what we&#39;re criticizing or we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.440" end="00:29:30.000" style="s2">about i should say</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.799" end="00:29:31.600" style="s2">um and i imagine people who are making</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.000" end="00:29:32.799" style="s2">these sort of critiques against castle</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.600" end="00:29:34.320" style="s2">culture they say all this guy&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.799" end="00:29:35.840" style="s2">critiquing cancer culture he&#39;s not he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.320" end="00:29:39.200" style="s2">not transcending it</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.840" end="00:29:40.480" style="s2">um could you steel man the the cancel</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.200" end="00:29:43.840" style="s2">culture critique</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.480" end="00:29:45.600" style="s2">uh and maybe uh what&#39;s what&#39;s there a</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.840" end="00:29:48.480" style="s2">value that can be included</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.600" end="00:29:49.120" style="s2">before we transcend it yeah great</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.480" end="00:29:52.480" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.120" end="00:29:55.200" style="s2">um yeah so i think for me</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.480" end="00:29:55.679" style="s2">the best i can steal men at is is that</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.200" end="00:29:58.720" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.679" end="00:30:01.200" style="s2">obviously like obviously right that</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.720" end="00:30:02.399" style="s2">twitter dog piling and you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.200" end="00:30:05.200" style="s2">attacking people</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.399" end="00:30:07.120" style="s2">on the as a sort of collective mob for a</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.200" end="00:30:09.760" style="s2">particular kind of behavior</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.120" end="00:30:11.840" style="s2">definitely creates an environment where</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.760" end="00:30:12.559" style="s2">where there is no possibility and this</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.840" end="00:30:15.120" style="s2">is something that</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.559" end="00:30:16.799" style="s2">you know my my friend recently passed</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.120" end="00:30:18.480" style="s2">michael brooks talked about there is no</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.799" end="00:30:21.120" style="s2">room for redemption</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.480" end="00:30:23.120" style="s2">in a culture that really is is hyper</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.120" end="00:30:23.919" style="s2">vigilantly looking for somebody to make</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.120" end="00:30:26.159" style="s2">a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.919" end="00:30:27.919" style="s2">and to take them down and of course the</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.159" end="00:30:30.000" style="s2">argument against that is always</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.919" end="00:30:32.000" style="s2">well the people that are being canceled</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.000" end="00:30:32.559" style="s2">are rich celebrities and they don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.000" end="00:30:34.640" style="s2">our help</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.559" end="00:30:36.480" style="s2">and they don&#39;t need a job etc i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.640" end="00:30:37.360" style="s2">really think that&#39;s necessarily the case</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.480" end="00:30:40.640" style="s2">i think it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.360" end="00:30:42.640" style="s2">um it&#39;s just whoever right there there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.640" end="00:30:44.640" style="s2">no particular target i think</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.640" end="00:30:47.360" style="s2">celebrities have or maybe an easier</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.640" end="00:30:50.080" style="s2">target um but i i don&#39;t think that is</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.360" end="00:30:53.520" style="s2">conducive to a healthy environment</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.080" end="00:30:55.600" style="s2">um now i will i will suggest that</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.520" end="00:30:57.360" style="s2">there&#39;s some good arguments coming from</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.600" end="00:30:59.519" style="s2">the left that defend this behavior and</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.360" end="00:31:00.320" style="s2">say well okay there&#39;s some collateral in</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.519" end="00:31:02.480" style="s2">that but</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.320" end="00:31:04.559" style="s2">generally speaking people who&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.480" end="00:31:07.360" style="s2">had a voice or any kind of social</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.559" end="00:31:08.159" style="s2">um social clout or social empowerment</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.360" end="00:31:10.960" style="s2">before</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.159" end="00:31:12.720" style="s2">finally do right and they finally have</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.960" end="00:31:14.640" style="s2">some kind of amplification</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.720" end="00:31:16.320" style="s2">that the media certainly is not giving</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.640" end="00:31:18.159" style="s2">them the media certainly you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.320" end="00:31:20.720" style="s2">journalism certainly hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.159" end="00:31:22.320" style="s2">up until very recently um sort of turned</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.720" end="00:31:25.600" style="s2">towards a more</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.320" end="00:31:26.640" style="s2">more receptive um uh especially well</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.600" end="00:31:30.080" style="s2">this has been critiqued</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.640" end="00:31:32.960" style="s2">the new york times et cetera but um</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.080" end="00:31:34.880" style="s2">my response to that would be you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.960" end="00:31:39.120" style="s2">that that is a good point</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.880" end="00:31:42.559" style="s2">but what is the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.120" end="00:31:44.840" style="s2">end point of this is it to merely be</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.559" end="00:31:46.960" style="s2">represented well in a deeply</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.840" end="00:31:48.720" style="s2">pathological neoliberal system</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.960" end="00:31:50.399" style="s2">in terms of you know being on a</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.720" end="00:31:52.080" style="s2">corporate board and represented well et</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.399" end="00:31:55.120" style="s2">cetera or having kind of a pr</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.080" end="00:31:56.159" style="s2">firm um that goes around in capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.120" end="00:31:58.480" style="s2">teaching people to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.159" end="00:32:00.480" style="s2">much more equitable in their social</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.480" end="00:32:02.320" style="s2">behavior policing that like</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.480" end="00:32:04.159" style="s2">obviously that&#39;s not all we want we want</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.320" end="00:32:05.360" style="s2">a society that is fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.159" end="00:32:08.399" style="s2">transformed</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.360" end="00:32:11.039" style="s2">um so i think i think there are</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.399" end="00:32:11.679" style="s2">the the result of cancel culture as a</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.039" end="00:32:13.039" style="s2">whole</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.679" end="00:32:15.039" style="s2">creates an environment that is</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.039" end="00:32:18.880" style="s2">fundamentally unredemptive</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.039" end="00:32:22.080" style="s2">right and the the capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.880" end="00:32:25.039" style="s2">make mistakes and be human right is</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.080" end="00:32:25.919" style="s2">is not possible in a culture that is</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.039" end="00:32:27.679" style="s2">predominantly</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.919" end="00:32:29.679" style="s2">you know looking to cancel people and</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.679" end="00:32:32.799" style="s2">cancel them out forever right</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.679" end="00:32:33.919" style="s2">so i i would like to see and that that</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.799" end="00:32:35.840" style="s2">would be a a</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.919" end="00:32:37.840" style="s2">an attempt to steal man the critique</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.840" end="00:32:40.559" style="s2">against cancel culture is that like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.840" end="00:32:42.399" style="s2">the kind of consciousness that produces</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.559" end="00:32:45.600" style="s2">is is ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.399" end="00:32:48.320" style="s2">um is ultimately anti-human</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.600" end="00:32:49.200" style="s2">because to be human is to be deeply</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.320" end="00:32:51.919" style="s2">flawed</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.200" end="00:32:52.960" style="s2">to make mistakes and to hopefully at</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.919" end="00:32:55.200" style="s2">some point</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.960" end="00:32:56.000" style="s2">come around with empathy and if they</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.200" end="00:32:57.519" style="s2">don&#39;t that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.000" end="00:32:59.120" style="s2">case right like i think there are some</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.519" end="00:33:00.799" style="s2">situations where</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.120" end="00:33:02.399" style="s2">maybe somebody should be shamed out of</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.799" end="00:33:04.640" style="s2">public office for for</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.399" end="00:33:05.760" style="s2">some really horrendous kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.640" end="00:33:08.240" style="s2">commentary or</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.760" end="00:33:10.000" style="s2">something along those lines um but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.240" end="00:33:12.640" style="s2">a slippery slope to go down that</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.000" end="00:33:14.240" style="s2">route and i know there&#39;s the there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.640" end="00:33:16.159" style="s2">the liberal critique</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.240" end="00:33:17.760" style="s2">uh which is the other kind of steel man</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.159" end="00:33:19.440" style="s2">a lot of people say like well you know</p>

<p begin="00:33:28.960" end="00:33:32.640" style="s2">right that&#39;s another way of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.880" end="00:33:34.399" style="s2">taking and flipping</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.640" end="00:33:36.720" style="s2">the the cancel culture on its head and</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.399" end="00:33:39.679" style="s2">say like i don&#39;t know let people say it</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.720" end="00:33:40.080" style="s2">but you know laugh at them you know and</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.679" end="00:33:41.360" style="s2">i think</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.080" end="00:33:43.360" style="s2">michael brooks was quite good at doing</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.360" end="00:33:45.039" style="s2">that actually about a lot of folks</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.360" end="00:33:46.960" style="s2">on the right that he engaged with a lot</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.039" end="00:33:50.880" style="s2">of uh celebrities</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.960" end="00:33:51.440" style="s2">um so i guess that would be my response</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.880" end="00:33:53.279" style="s2">right like</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.440" end="00:33:54.799" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t produce a culture that is</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.279" end="00:33:57.919" style="s2">ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.799" end="00:34:00.799" style="s2">able to hold human flaws</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.919" end="00:34:02.320" style="s2">in complexity and therefore what is its</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.799" end="00:34:04.240" style="s2">real</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.320" end="00:34:06.159" style="s2">what is it really doing you know is it</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.240" end="00:34:08.399" style="s2">then it just sort of becomes</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.159" end="00:34:09.760" style="s2">an another anti-human force in a world</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.399" end="00:34:12.800" style="s2">where we really need</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.760" end="00:34:16.079" style="s2">a much more regenerative and redemptive</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.800" end="00:34:18.800" style="s2">and empathic approach empathy and</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.079" end="00:34:21.919" style="s2">compassion can be ruthless sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.800" end="00:34:22.480" style="s2">but i don&#39;t think mob mentalities on</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.919" end="00:34:25.599" style="s2">twitter</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.480" end="00:34:27.200" style="s2">again are a really</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.599" end="00:34:28.720" style="s2">stemming from the left they&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.200" end="00:34:30.240" style="s2">phenomenon that the left has taken on</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.720" end="00:34:32.839" style="s2">that&#39;s part of neoliberalism</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.240" end="00:34:35.599" style="s2">and b you know mobbing people there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.839" end="00:34:38.320" style="s2">just how can we really defend that</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.599" end="00:34:39.599" style="s2">ultimately right so i i would say those</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.320" end="00:34:41.520" style="s2">are those are at least two strong</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.599" end="00:34:43.200" style="s2">arguments against</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.520" end="00:34:44.639" style="s2">really endorsing this phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.200" end="00:34:47.520" style="s2">wholesale or whole cloth</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.639" end="00:34:49.040" style="s2">um but but the response isn&#39;t to fight</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.520" end="00:34:49.599" style="s2">it and say we shouldn&#39;t be doing that to</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.040" end="00:34:51.919" style="s2">say like</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.599" end="00:34:53.599" style="s2">well we what are we for right we&#39;re for</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.919" end="00:34:56.240" style="s2">a redemptive regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.599" end="00:34:58.720" style="s2">empathic culture that is fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.240" end="00:35:01.119" style="s2">pro-human and not anti-human</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.720" end="00:35:02.400" style="s2">um can we achieve that through this sort</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.119" end="00:35:04.000" style="s2">of collective behavior</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.400" end="00:35:05.760" style="s2">you know we should ask that question i</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.000" end="00:35:06.960" style="s2">don&#39;t think we can right i think we need</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.760" end="00:35:11.680" style="s2">a much more</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.960" end="00:35:13.520" style="s2">um uh human-oriented attitude but</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.680" end="00:35:14.720" style="s2">yeah um and what comes to mind is what</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.520" end="00:35:16.000" style="s2">you mentioned young childhood he has</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.720" end="00:35:19.520" style="s2">this excellent book uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.000" end="00:35:20.880" style="s2">in the swarm that talks about that um</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.520" end="00:35:22.400" style="s2">yeah so i&#39;ll sneak in another question</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.880" end="00:35:23.200" style="s2">then we&#39;ll go to the question in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.400" end="00:35:25.599" style="s2">chat</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.200" end="00:35:28.480" style="s2">um you talked a little bit about this</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.599" end="00:35:30.240" style="s2">the recuperation aspect um and</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.480" end="00:35:32.240" style="s2">the white paper i had on medic tribes i</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.240" end="00:35:33.680" style="s2">had this this line um</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.240" end="00:35:35.440" style="s2">corporations can be woke but they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.680" end="00:35:38.079" style="s2">be anti-capital and how this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.440" end="00:35:39.680" style="s2">like neutered the left and you know uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.079" end="00:35:41.599" style="s2">um a lot of people talk about this</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.680" end="00:35:44.720" style="s2">including the the late michael brooks</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.599" end="00:35:45.920" style="s2">um so i was wondering how uh if i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.720" end="00:35:48.000" style="s2">too sophisticated of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.920" end="00:35:49.520" style="s2">the new critiques or conversations</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.000" end="00:35:51.359" style="s2">around this but</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.520" end="00:35:53.200" style="s2">could you talk a little bit about how uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.359" end="00:35:55.680" style="s2">corporations are</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.200" end="00:35:56.400" style="s2">using cancel culture itself to neuter</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.680" end="00:35:58.400" style="s2">the the left</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.400" end="00:35:59.760" style="s2">especially kind of the anti-capitalist</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.400" end="00:36:01.920" style="s2">aspect of it</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.760" end="00:36:03.760" style="s2">yeah this is the strongest critique that</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.920" end="00:36:04.880" style="s2">i think has come from the left about</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.760" end="00:36:08.079" style="s2">this which is</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.880" end="00:36:11.920" style="s2">you know uh using</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.079" end="00:36:12.320" style="s2">using um uh this this new especially</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.920" end="00:36:15.599" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.320" end="00:36:17.040" style="s2">year with um uh deangelo&#39;s book on white</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.599" end="00:36:19.040" style="s2">fragility has been sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.040" end="00:36:20.320" style="s2">contesting point matt taibbi had that</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.040" end="00:36:22.320" style="s2">piece um</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.320" end="00:36:23.839" style="s2">um adolf reed had some interesting</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.320" end="00:36:24.880" style="s2">comments on that piece and so did</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.839" end="00:36:28.560" style="s2">michael brooks</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.880" end="00:36:31.040" style="s2">um and part of the issue here is again</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.560" end="00:36:32.720" style="s2">looking at what what is the ultimate aim</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.040" end="00:36:34.720" style="s2">and function of this if this simply</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.720" end="00:36:37.839" style="s2">becomes an armature of</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.720" end="00:36:40.480" style="s2">um the corporate sector to like</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.839" end="00:36:41.359" style="s2">make mindfulness appropriate a thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.480" end="00:36:44.880" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.359" end="00:36:47.599" style="s2">was genuinely interested in economic</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.880" end="00:36:49.680" style="s2">and racial justice right it could be</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.599" end="00:36:53.760" style="s2">genuinely transformative</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.680" end="00:36:55.680" style="s2">um and appropriate and sort of declaw it</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.760" end="00:36:57.599" style="s2">to allow it to fit into the armistice of</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.680" end="00:36:59.520" style="s2">corporatism and capitalism and this we</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.599" end="00:37:03.040" style="s2">see this everywhere and this is again</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.520" end="00:37:03.280" style="s2">um the reason why uh i see this is such</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.040" end="00:37:05.040" style="s2">an</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.280" end="00:37:07.040" style="s2">endemic phenomenon is that we can look</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.040" end="00:37:08.240" style="s2">at the intellectual dark web and see the</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.040" end="00:37:11.440" style="s2">same thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.240" end="00:37:14.480" style="s2">the same argument watered against um</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.440" end="00:37:17.520" style="s2">uh jordan peterson&#39;s work right which is</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.480" end="00:37:18.480" style="s2">cleaning your own room in a neoliberal</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.520" end="00:37:20.640" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.480" end="00:37:22.000" style="s2">is a great argument like that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.640" end="00:37:23.599" style="s2">fantastic yes like</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.000" end="00:37:25.040" style="s2">don&#39;t blame it on any kind of social</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.599" end="00:37:26.960" style="s2">exterior issues</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.040" end="00:37:28.960" style="s2">it&#39;s only about cleaning up your own</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.960" end="00:37:30.160" style="s2">interior your mess your own subjectivity</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.960" end="00:37:34.079" style="s2">and having a better</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.160" end="00:37:35.680" style="s2">um responsible orientation towards life</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.079" end="00:37:38.000" style="s2">don&#39;t worry about what the corporations</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.680" end="00:37:41.359" style="s2">are doing that&#39;s a slippery slope to the</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.000" end="00:37:42.800" style="s2">um the progressive leftist attitude that</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.359" end="00:37:44.320" style="s2">just wants everything handed to it and</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.800" end="00:37:46.960" style="s2">wants a perfect ideal</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.320" end="00:37:47.440" style="s2">world right so that is a great argument</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.960" end="00:37:48.880" style="s2">too</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.440" end="00:37:51.119" style="s2">but this is this is what i mean that</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.880" end="00:37:55.000" style="s2">this sort of neoliberal structure</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.119" end="00:37:57.599" style="s2">um in that sort of uh uh</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.000" end="00:37:59.760" style="s2">cthulhu-like capacity this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.599" end="00:38:01.280" style="s2">tentacular capacity can take things on</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.760" end="00:38:02.960" style="s2">the left and the right and appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.280" end="00:38:05.680" style="s2">them for itself right</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.960" end="00:38:06.800" style="s2">so we that is why we really need that</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.680" end="00:38:08.800" style="s2">literacy to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.800" end="00:38:10.640" style="s2">help us navigate this and make the</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.800" end="00:38:13.839" style="s2">critiques where they&#39;re necessary</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.640" end="00:38:17.680" style="s2">um so yeah i think you know having</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.839" end="00:38:19.680" style="s2">having a corporate uh woke</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.680" end="00:38:21.119" style="s2">culture going forward where this is just</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.680" end="00:38:23.839" style="s2">going to be part of</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.119" end="00:38:24.320" style="s2">um you know the congress taking taking a</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.839" end="00:38:27.040" style="s2">knee</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.320" end="00:38:28.320" style="s2">but then actively legislatively and</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.040" end="00:38:31.200" style="s2">economically</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.320" end="00:38:32.560" style="s2">you know not voting for racial justice</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.200" end="00:38:34.079" style="s2">in terms of you know where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.560" end="00:38:35.440" style="s2">putting their money where the where the</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.079" end="00:38:37.760" style="s2">power is going right</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.440" end="00:38:40.240" style="s2">where the institutional and structural</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.760" end="00:38:42.560" style="s2">redu redistribution isn&#39;t happening</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.240" end="00:38:44.160" style="s2">right but if they can symbolically do</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.560" end="00:38:46.720" style="s2">this then somehow</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.160" end="00:38:47.760" style="s2">you know replicated i think this that is</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.720" end="00:38:50.320" style="s2">very dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.760" end="00:38:51.839" style="s2">um so if anything though i would say</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.320" end="00:38:53.440" style="s2">like and i take this as a friendlier</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.839" end="00:38:54.960" style="s2">because a lot of people on the left are</p>

<p begin="00:39:27.359" end="00:39:30.960" style="s2">at the forefront of what we&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.280" end="00:39:32.720" style="s2">so when we show up to the starbucks</p>

<p begin="00:39:48.079" end="00:39:52.000" style="s2">um and use this as a sort of trojan</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.400" end="00:39:54.480" style="s2">horse for doing so</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.000" end="00:39:56.880" style="s2">and i think that requires this is the</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.480" end="00:39:58.720" style="s2">critique back on the left that requires</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.880" end="00:40:01.200" style="s2">a lot of synthesis and coalition</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.720" end="00:40:03.280" style="s2">building because again when we said</p>

<p begin="00:40:20.400" end="00:40:24.400" style="s2">michael used to call it a machiavellian</p>

<p begin="00:40:28.319" end="00:40:31.680" style="s2">very well</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.119" end="00:40:32.400" style="s2">and we have to make inroads where we can</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.680" end="00:40:34.319" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.400" end="00:40:36.160" style="s2">i think that&#39;s what&#39;s missing and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.319" end="00:40:39.359" style="s2">that&#39;s what we&#39;ve seen kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.160" end="00:40:40.960" style="s2">um fall back on or or the the issues</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.359" end="00:40:42.640" style="s2">right now with black lives matter a few</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.960" end="00:40:44.800" style="s2">months on have been like</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.640" end="00:40:45.920" style="s2">where does this really go from here you</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.800" end="00:40:48.000" style="s2">know um</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.920" end="00:40:48.960" style="s2">are we really going to just let congress</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.000" end="00:40:50.800" style="s2">argue about that</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.960" end="00:40:52.880" style="s2">where is our organizing and labor power</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.800" end="00:40:56.800" style="s2">here because that is integral to</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.880" end="00:40:59.920" style="s2">racial justice and vice versa</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.800" end="00:41:03.680" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a great response um</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.920" end="00:41:05.680" style="s2">so uh we&#39;ll go to uh lisa</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.680" end="00:41:07.119" style="s2">i copied and pasted your question uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.680" end="00:41:11.200" style="s2">below if you could uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.119" end="00:41:11.200" style="s2">mute yourself and read it to uh jeremy</p>

<p begin="00:41:17.119" end="00:41:23.920" style="s2">yeah sorry um i&#39;m here</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.040" end="00:41:26.079" style="s2">i think i have a new question uh based</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.920" end="00:41:27.680" style="s2">on what jeremy just said sorry i was</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.079" end="00:41:30.800" style="s2">camera off</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.680" end="00:41:32.000" style="s2">um what i mean i had i wanted to build</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.800" end="00:41:35.280" style="s2">on ron and</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.000" end="00:41:37.680" style="s2">jay i&#39;s point is the left right frame</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.280" end="00:41:39.920" style="s2">obscuring our ability to encounter the</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.680" end="00:41:40.800" style="s2">various splinters on the left the reason</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.920" end="00:41:43.520" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.800" end="00:41:44.800" style="s2">said that jeremy is ma and maybe i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.520" end="00:41:47.040" style="s2">like to pick up on</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.800" end="00:41:48.240" style="s2">the question that comes to mind after</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.040" end="00:41:51.440" style="s2">what you just said</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.240" end="00:41:56.160" style="s2">is those wedges you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.440" end="00:41:58.560" style="s2">really knowing the system um</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.160" end="00:42:00.880" style="s2">i think there&#39;s something tacit in this</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.560" end="00:42:03.920" style="s2">conversation about</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.880" end="00:42:07.520" style="s2">um to take</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.920" end="00:42:10.720" style="s2">a certain position toward the</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.520" end="00:42:11.680" style="s2">like admittedly these are effects these</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.720" end="00:42:16.240" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.680" end="00:42:18.079" style="s2">ephemeral effects of um you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.240" end="00:42:21.200" style="s2">canceled culture is just</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.079" end="00:42:24.079" style="s2">uh effects in a much bigger system and</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.200" end="00:42:25.119" style="s2">we don&#39;t need to you know double down on</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.079" end="00:42:29.040" style="s2">those and</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.119" end="00:42:33.040" style="s2">add to the hysteria and the polarization</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.040" end="00:42:36.640" style="s2">how would you think about for example</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.040" end="00:42:38.880" style="s2">uh you made the point that yet um</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.640" end="00:42:41.040" style="s2">i would you know i would use the new the</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.880" end="00:42:45.440" style="s2">term the new left</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.040" end="00:42:48.480" style="s2">what how would what would it look like</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.440" end="00:42:50.800" style="s2">for the new left to i don&#39;t really want</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.480" end="00:42:53.839" style="s2">to use the word ally because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.800" end="00:42:56.960" style="s2">um obscured but what would it look for</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.839" end="00:43:00.960" style="s2">that like today for the new left to</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.960" end="00:43:03.920" style="s2">find a sliver of common ground with say</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.960" end="00:43:03.920" style="s2">adolf reed</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.119" end="00:43:09.599" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a good question and this is</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.560" end="00:43:13.119" style="s2">an example i think of</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.599" end="00:43:14.400" style="s2">the the problems like the in-house</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.119" end="00:43:17.520" style="s2">problems on the left</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.400" end="00:43:18.160" style="s2">which is this um perceived divide</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.520" end="00:43:20.720" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.160" end="00:43:22.720" style="s2">class reductionists right and then</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.720" end="00:43:24.720" style="s2">identity politics they&#39;re seen as</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.720" end="00:43:26.240" style="s2">split whereas the history you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.720" end="00:43:28.000" style="s2">the new left uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.240" end="00:43:29.359" style="s2">the history of the new left since the</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.000" end="00:43:32.960" style="s2">1960s</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.359" end="00:43:35.520" style="s2">those two questions those two struggles</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.960" end="00:43:36.160" style="s2">class and race were very integral to</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.520" end="00:43:39.200" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.160" end="00:43:41.280" style="s2">very complex very nuanced approaches</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.200" end="00:43:42.720" style="s2">where you know you know one theorist may</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.280" end="00:43:45.119" style="s2">have leaned one way or the other</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.720" end="00:43:46.160" style="s2">but that was held together we really</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.119" end="00:43:48.960" style="s2">have seen</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.160" end="00:43:50.480" style="s2">the bifurcation even happen on the left</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.960" end="00:43:53.359" style="s2">which is a problem right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.480" end="00:43:54.880" style="s2">that&#39;s why um to take the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.359" end="00:43:56.880" style="s2">consciousness studies orientation or</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.880" end="00:43:59.119" style="s2">integral approach to this is</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.880" end="00:44:01.040" style="s2">okay this is a real problem that even</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.119" end="00:44:03.359" style="s2">and even in a um</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.040" end="00:44:04.319" style="s2">a body of work in literature and a</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.359" end="00:44:07.920" style="s2">history of different</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.319" end="00:44:09.040" style="s2">movements and traditions uh even there</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.920" end="00:44:10.880" style="s2">that understand</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.040" end="00:44:12.319" style="s2">that the commodification of the human</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.880" end="00:44:14.800" style="s2">being and the</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.319" end="00:44:16.000" style="s2">atomization of culture is a problem that</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.800" end="00:44:17.920" style="s2">we need to overcome</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.000" end="00:44:19.680" style="s2">and they have a literacy about that even</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.920" end="00:44:22.240" style="s2">they are</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.680" end="00:44:23.520" style="s2">undone by those same forces of hyper</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.240" end="00:44:26.480" style="s2">fragmentation</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.520" end="00:44:27.680" style="s2">which is again why i think the left</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.480" end="00:44:29.920" style="s2">can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.680" end="00:44:31.599" style="s2">supersede this without an integrative</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.920" end="00:44:34.480" style="s2">approach without really</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.599" end="00:44:36.560" style="s2">getting into that tertiary or that third</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.480" end="00:44:37.760" style="s2">form of literacy which is that</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.560" end="00:44:39.920" style="s2">okay we need to get into the</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.760" end="00:44:41.520" style="s2">phenomenology of this we need certain</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.920" end="00:44:44.640" style="s2">practices that help us get</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.520" end="00:44:46.560" style="s2">out of hyper polarization or fixed</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.640" end="00:44:47.760" style="s2">particular you know identity fight</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.560" end="00:44:51.440" style="s2">infighting online</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.760" end="00:44:54.960" style="s2">like what kind of practices</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.440" end="00:44:57.280" style="s2">both social and individual can help um</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.960" end="00:44:58.960" style="s2">um be a kind of corrosive against</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.280" end="00:45:00.640" style="s2">atomization right that can be</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.960" end="00:45:01.839" style="s2">integrative that can cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.640" end="00:45:03.440" style="s2">compassion right</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.839" end="00:45:05.920" style="s2">and that&#39;s one of the things uh michael</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.440" end="00:45:08.640" style="s2">brooks and i were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.920" end="00:45:09.760" style="s2">uh in terms of you know moving forward</p>

<p begin="00:45:16.880" end="00:45:20.720" style="s2">seeming like it was about to win here in</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.640" end="00:45:23.760" style="s2">the united states and then completely</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.720" end="00:45:24.560" style="s2">um rubber banding the other way there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.760" end="00:45:26.079" style="s2">there was a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.560" end="00:45:27.839" style="s2">failures there were a lot of gains there</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.079" end="00:45:29.760" style="s2">was a lot of awakening there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.839" end="00:45:32.079" style="s2">problems and there&#39;s a lot of divides so</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.760" end="00:45:34.160" style="s2">it&#39;s like where do we go from here and</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.079" end="00:45:36.319" style="s2">this is more of a question of the left</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.160" end="00:45:37.119" style="s2">but i think it also applies to anybody</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.319" end="00:45:38.720" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.119" end="00:45:41.280" style="s2">what are the techniques that help us</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.720" end="00:45:44.000" style="s2">overcome hyper fragmentation and</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.280" end="00:45:45.520" style="s2">atomization they can&#39;t just be</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.000" end="00:45:46.800" style="s2">you know reading leftist literature</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.520" end="00:45:48.880" style="s2">leftists have been doing that that</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.800" end="00:45:50.480" style="s2">hasn&#39;t necessarily worked right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.880" end="00:45:52.400" style="s2">only part of the literacy</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.480" end="00:45:53.760" style="s2">so i do think we need the via</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.400" end="00:45:55.680" style="s2">contemplativa</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.760" end="00:45:57.200" style="s2">we do need practices of presence and</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.680" end="00:45:59.040" style="s2">empathy and compassion</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.200" end="00:46:00.800" style="s2">and we do need to bring these into these</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.040" end="00:46:03.839" style="s2">kinds of conversations</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.800" end="00:46:07.040" style="s2">um because i do think you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.839" end="00:46:09.839" style="s2">mindfulness has been sort of</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.040" end="00:46:12.160" style="s2">depending on how we create and architect</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.839" end="00:46:15.440" style="s2">the environment for these practices</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.160" end="00:46:17.839" style="s2">um will also kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.440" end="00:46:19.040" style="s2">mold or frame how they how they come out</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.839" end="00:46:21.599" style="s2">right so if we create</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.040" end="00:46:23.359" style="s2">mindfulness and we say oh this will help</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.599" end="00:46:24.720" style="s2">you work better and you could become</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.359" end="00:46:26.480" style="s2">more present and you</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.720" end="00:46:28.480" style="s2">feel less stressed those are the</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.480" end="00:46:31.599" style="s2">outcomes then like yeah you&#39;re gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.480" end="00:46:34.160" style="s2">like a kind of a docile uh quasi</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.599" end="00:46:35.920" style="s2">quasi calm worker in an environment</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.160" end="00:46:38.720" style="s2">where nothing&#39;s actually changed</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.920" end="00:46:39.520" style="s2">but if we in frame these practices and</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.720" end="00:46:42.240" style="s2">modalities</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.520" end="00:46:43.680" style="s2">as radical things like if you really</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.240" end="00:46:46.800" style="s2">want to become radically</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.680" end="00:46:48.640" style="s2">present then you will have no no</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.800" end="00:46:51.359" style="s2">interest in continuing this culture of</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.640" end="00:46:53.760" style="s2">atomization and your own</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.359" end="00:46:55.280" style="s2">endeavors creative social and just your</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.760" end="00:46:59.280" style="s2">mere presence</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.280" end="00:47:01.119" style="s2">are or uh um not anti but it&#39;s for the</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.280" end="00:47:02.800" style="s2">human and it&#39;s for the more than human i</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.119" end="00:47:04.560" style="s2">mentioned the post human is this turn i</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.800" end="00:47:07.760" style="s2">don&#39;t want to get into too many complex</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.560" end="00:47:10.720" style="s2">academic jargon phrases but what i mean</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.760" end="00:47:11.040" style="s2">for the sake of this conversation is is</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.720" end="00:47:13.760" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.040" end="00:47:15.280" style="s2">openness to ecological and and complex</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.760" end="00:47:18.319" style="s2">thought that we need</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.280" end="00:47:21.839" style="s2">is through this ability to achieve</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.319" end="00:47:24.559" style="s2">via contempliva to reclaim temporics</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.839" end="00:47:25.440" style="s2">to reclaim social and inter-subjective</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.559" end="00:47:27.520" style="s2">spaces</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.440" end="00:47:29.359" style="s2">and to say no to like i don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.520" end="00:47:30.079" style="s2">atomization i don&#39;t want to go on</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.359" end="00:47:32.400" style="s2">twitter and</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.079" end="00:47:33.839" style="s2">fire up my twitter and take somebody</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.400" end="00:47:35.680" style="s2">down and these great</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.839" end="00:47:38.640" style="s2">these great like sharp shooting tweets</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.680" end="00:47:41.119" style="s2">like we all will make mistakes but</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.640" end="00:47:43.119" style="s2">we need to be thinking about this</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.119" end="00:47:45.119" style="s2">looping it back to the environmental</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.119" end="00:47:46.240" style="s2">as well like what are the environments</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.119" end="00:47:48.160" style="s2">that were facilitating these</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.240" end="00:47:48.800" style="s2">conversations how can they actually be</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.160" end="00:47:51.440" style="s2">radical</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.800" end="00:47:52.000" style="s2">and integrative um and again that</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.440" end="00:47:53.440" style="s2">doesn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.000" end="00:47:55.440" style="s2">apply to the left i think this is a</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.440" end="00:47:57.680" style="s2">question everybody</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.440" end="00:47:59.040" style="s2">is needs to be thinking about in their</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.680" end="00:48:00.480" style="s2">own domains</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.040" end="00:48:03.119" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if that directly answered</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.480" end="00:48:03.119" style="s2">your question but</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.839" end="00:48:07.200" style="s2">thank you lisa dylan you had a question</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.640" end="00:48:08.720" style="s2">i</p>

<p begin="00:48:08.720" end="00:48:13.680" style="s2">to mute yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.720" end="00:48:13.680" style="s2">uh read it to jeremy</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.119" end="00:48:21.119" style="s2">uh yeah um so</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.240" end="00:48:22.880" style="s2">if cancer in part a function of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.119" end="00:48:24.319" style="s2">mediums we&#39;re using for public discourse</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.880" end="00:48:26.880" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.319" end="00:48:28.240" style="s2">how can we mitigate that um would</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.880" end="00:48:29.280" style="s2">efforts to improve rhetoric and</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.240" end="00:48:32.319" style="s2">emotional literacy</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.280" end="00:48:32.880" style="s2">fit into the spectrum of platforms we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.319" end="00:48:35.839" style="s2">using</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.880" end="00:48:36.559" style="s2">today and i&#39;m asking this i&#39;m interested</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.839" end="00:48:39.440" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.559" end="00:48:40.240" style="s2">the potential of things like for example</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.440" end="00:48:43.280" style="s2">the stoa</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.240" end="00:48:46.640" style="s2">and letters.wiki to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.280" end="00:48:47.599" style="s2">improve our public discourse as we go</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.640" end="00:48:50.960" style="s2">forward</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.599" end="00:48:53.520" style="s2">thanks yeah that&#39;s a great question</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.960" end="00:48:55.280" style="s2">you know i i would say like we&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.520" end="00:48:57.839" style="s2">this point where</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.280" end="00:48:59.359" style="s2">like this is just beginning to be a</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.839" end="00:49:01.280" style="s2">conversation and it may be</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.359" end="00:49:02.720" style="s2">it took the pandemic for us to all be</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.280" end="00:49:05.920" style="s2">stuck online</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.720" end="00:49:06.640" style="s2">seeing the the the potential and the</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.920" end="00:49:09.920" style="s2">pitfalls</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.640" end="00:49:12.079" style="s2">of completely replacing you know human</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.920" end="00:49:13.280" style="s2">to human contact with the prosthetic of</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.079" end="00:49:15.040" style="s2">social media</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.280" end="00:49:16.880" style="s2">that like oh there&#39;s a lot of limits to</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.040" end="00:49:20.240" style="s2">this right so</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.880" end="00:49:22.400" style="s2">um yes i think any kind of modalities</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.240" end="00:49:23.599" style="s2">and practices and practice spaces</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.400" end="00:49:25.520" style="s2">that have different techniques you</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.599" end="00:49:28.160" style="s2">mentioned rhetoric and emotional</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.520" end="00:49:31.359" style="s2">literacy i think those are great ideas</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.160" end="00:49:32.880" style="s2">um i would love to see just more</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.359" end="00:49:34.079" style="s2">concrete practices in terms of what</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.880" end="00:49:37.520" style="s2">you&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.079" end="00:49:38.079" style="s2">um whatever you know part of like the</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.520" end="00:49:39.839" style="s2">integral</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.079" end="00:49:41.599" style="s2">response i think is is getting a sense</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.839" end="00:49:44.400" style="s2">of coherence about what we&#39;re for</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.599" end="00:49:46.480" style="s2">not just what we&#39;re against and then</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.400" end="00:49:49.680" style="s2">developing the techniques that</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.480" end="00:49:50.880" style="s2">that move towards that or help achieve</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.680" end="00:49:53.680" style="s2">that in some way</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.880" end="00:49:55.359" style="s2">so those could be two mentioned via</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.680" end="00:49:57.440" style="s2">contemplativa is another one</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.359" end="00:49:59.599" style="s2">you know this whole idea in my next book</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.440" end="00:50:01.440" style="s2">um fragments of an integral future</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.599" end="00:50:02.960" style="s2">futurism i&#39;m talking about reclaiming</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.440" end="00:50:04.720" style="s2">time and presence</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.960" end="00:50:06.319" style="s2">as a sort of radical openness that i was</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.720" end="00:50:09.680" style="s2">just mentioning i think</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.319" end="00:50:10.559" style="s2">some kind of practice or praxis in which</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.680" end="00:50:12.960" style="s2">we are</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.559" end="00:50:13.920" style="s2">using theory in a container of other</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.960" end="00:50:17.680" style="s2">modalities</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.920" end="00:50:19.440" style="s2">together integrally can be very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.680" end="00:50:20.880" style="s2">and i don&#39;t think there will be single</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.440" end="00:50:22.960" style="s2">answers i think</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.880" end="00:50:24.480" style="s2">what would be great to see is if the</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.960" end="00:50:27.760" style="s2">stoa was a platform</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.480" end="00:50:29.200" style="s2">and i think it is uh to an extent</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.760" end="00:50:31.119" style="s2">that is exploring these different</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.200" end="00:50:32.400" style="s2">modalities and seeing what sticks and</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.119" end="00:50:33.440" style="s2">what&#39;s working right</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.400" end="00:50:35.119" style="s2">because part of what i think this</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.440" end="00:50:37.119" style="s2">integral turn is is really kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.119" end="00:50:39.359" style="s2">embracing what nora bateson talks about</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.119" end="00:50:41.760" style="s2">like mutual learning and symmetry</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.359" end="00:50:43.520" style="s2">right so this is an open-ended learning</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.760" end="00:50:45.520" style="s2">and mutual learning process that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.520" end="00:50:48.880" style="s2">all trying to explore together</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.520" end="00:50:52.000" style="s2">so feedback for each other</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.880" end="00:50:53.280" style="s2">experimentation right um and innovation</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.000" end="00:50:55.200" style="s2">and then sharing you know like</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.280" end="00:50:56.559" style="s2">let other communities pop up that are</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.200" end="00:50:59.599" style="s2">in-house or in a city</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.559" end="00:51:02.400" style="s2">um uh halfway across the world</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.599" end="00:51:02.960" style="s2">um that are also exploring these things</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.400" end="00:51:06.160" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.960" end="00:51:08.000" style="s2">when we&#39;re talking about liberalism and</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.160" end="00:51:09.440" style="s2">late capitalism and the climate crisis</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.000" end="00:51:10.800" style="s2">and then we&#39;re also talking on the</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.440" end="00:51:13.119" style="s2">the sub-layer of that is the</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.800" end="00:51:15.520" style="s2">perspectival crisis that gepsor talks</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.119" end="00:51:18.160" style="s2">about the crisis of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.520" end="00:51:19.680" style="s2">this is a world crisis that like we need</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.160" end="00:51:20.880" style="s2">to be building these mesh works of</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.680" end="00:51:23.200" style="s2">mutual learning</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.880" end="00:51:24.559" style="s2">to figure out to solve together right to</p>

<p begin="00:51:24.559" end="00:51:30.160" style="s2">so yeah i would just say wholeheartedly</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.520" end="00:51:32.800" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.160" end="00:51:33.760" style="s2">that&#39;s awesome um and it looks like</p>

<p begin="00:51:33.760" end="00:51:36.880" style="s2">uh released a video with john verviki</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.839" end="00:51:37.520" style="s2">myself talking about some of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.880" end="00:51:38.800" style="s2">research</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.520" end="00:51:40.000" style="s2">uh that we&#39;re doing with the psychology</p>

<p begin="00:51:40.000" end="00:51:43.760" style="s2">modalities that we&#39;re experimenting here</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.280" end="00:51:45.119" style="s2">with the stoa so i put that in the chat</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.760" end="00:51:46.480" style="s2">so many good questions we&#39;re not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.119" end="00:51:48.640" style="s2">get to all of them but maybe we can</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.480" end="00:51:49.920" style="s2">sneak in one or two more uh</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.640" end="00:51:51.520" style="s2">maggie you just had a really good</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.920" end="00:51:52.160" style="s2">question if you can unmute yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.520" end="00:51:55.760" style="s2">ask it to</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.160" end="00:51:56.160" style="s2">jeremy yeah sure thank you so much for</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.760" end="00:51:58.880" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.160" end="00:52:00.400" style="s2">excellent um overview um i&#39;ve really</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.880" end="00:52:01.839" style="s2">enjoyed the integral left</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.400" end="00:52:03.839" style="s2">kind of systemic structural critique</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.839" end="00:52:05.119" style="s2">which is how i&#39;ve always understood and</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.839" end="00:52:07.440" style="s2">learned about the left</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.119" end="00:52:09.119" style="s2">and i think yeah i appreciate that</p>

<p begin="00:52:09.119" end="00:52:12.160" style="s2">and how that distinguishes from i think</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.440" end="00:52:14.400" style="s2">how</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.160" end="00:52:15.760" style="s2">kinds of cultures commonly critiqued my</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.400" end="00:52:18.240" style="s2">question is around</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.760" end="00:52:19.200" style="s2">that kind of integral left aspiration</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.240" end="00:52:21.280" style="s2">and i&#39;m hearing you</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.200" end="00:52:22.240" style="s2">emphasize kind of collective spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.280" end="00:52:23.839" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.240" end="00:52:26.640" style="s2">this kind of oneness between different</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.839" end="00:52:29.280" style="s2">identities and also class and economic</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.640" end="00:52:30.000" style="s2">equity and structural equity and i feel</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.280" end="00:52:31.440" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.000" end="00:52:33.119" style="s2">fundamentally contradicts some of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.440" end="00:52:34.800" style="s2">more traditional conservative</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.119" end="00:52:36.160" style="s2">you know peterson right wing values of</p>

<p begin="00:52:40.079" end="00:52:43.280" style="s2">and ethically</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.880" end="00:52:44.160" style="s2">incompatible with the system and so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.280" end="00:52:47.520" style="s2">just curious</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.160" end="00:52:49.280" style="s2">how you can really transcend and include</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.520" end="00:52:51.440" style="s2">both those things because they feel</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.280" end="00:52:52.400" style="s2">fundamentally incompatible and i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.440" end="00:52:55.200" style="s2">struggling</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.400" end="00:52:55.680" style="s2">to reconcile the both and within these</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.200" end="00:52:59.200" style="s2">two</p>

<p begin="00:52:59.200" end="00:53:03.200" style="s2">canceled culture and broader critiques</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.520" end="00:53:04.079" style="s2">of integrating the left and right</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.200" end="00:53:06.559" style="s2">political</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.079" end="00:53:07.599" style="s2">being sure great question and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.559" end="00:53:10.400" style="s2">something that comes up</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.599" end="00:53:11.599" style="s2">um in a recent conversation with uh</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.400" end="00:53:13.760" style="s2">jason snyder</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.599" end="00:53:14.960" style="s2">and jared james and we were talking with</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.760" end="00:53:16.720" style="s2">them uh on</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.960" end="00:53:18.160" style="s2">growingdown podcast and it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.720" end="00:53:20.559" style="s2">question of where</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.160" end="00:53:21.280" style="s2">you know in this in this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.559" end="00:53:23.520" style="s2">thematic</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.280" end="00:53:25.359" style="s2">of the emergent integral left and how</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.520" end="00:53:26.800" style="s2">you know where the where the coherencies</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.359" end="00:53:27.599" style="s2">of the integral of the a perspective of</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.800" end="00:53:31.200" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.599" end="00:53:33.680" style="s2">um seemed to be friendlier to</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.200" end="00:53:34.240" style="s2">leftist positions of reclaiming the</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.680" end="00:53:36.079" style="s2">common</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.240" end="00:53:38.160" style="s2">social redis social and structural</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.079" end="00:53:41.119" style="s2">redistribution even like in gepser in</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.160" end="00:53:43.119" style="s2">1949 he was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.119" end="00:53:45.440" style="s2">uh the restructuration of power the</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.119" end="00:53:47.119" style="s2">supersession of patriarchy</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.440" end="00:53:49.040" style="s2">um so he was thinking this is quite</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.119" end="00:53:51.040" style="s2">quite a big overturning</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.040" end="00:53:53.440" style="s2">and so how do these how do these</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.040" end="00:53:55.040" style="s2">emergent themes reconcile with</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.440" end="00:53:57.359" style="s2">more conservative principles of</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.040" end="00:54:01.040" style="s2">individualism and i think</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.359" end="00:54:02.079" style="s2">to some degree the transcendent include</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.040" end="00:54:04.079" style="s2">or perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.079" end="00:54:06.160" style="s2">the uh maybe a better metaphor than</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.079" end="00:54:08.640" style="s2">transcendent include would be</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.160" end="00:54:11.440" style="s2">borrowing from lynne margus margulis and</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.640" end="00:54:14.319" style="s2">donna haraway&#39;s symbiogenesis</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.440" end="00:54:15.760" style="s2">in which there are certain functions</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.319" end="00:54:16.400" style="s2">that will always exist and need to</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.760" end="00:54:18.960" style="s2">persist</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.400" end="00:54:19.920" style="s2">such as individualism personal</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.960" end="00:54:23.760" style="s2">subjectivity</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.920" end="00:54:25.680" style="s2">sovereignty autonomy but they exist</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.760" end="00:54:27.920" style="s2">within a larger</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.680" end="00:54:30.319" style="s2">relationship and they exist because of</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.920" end="00:54:32.319" style="s2">that ecological relationship</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.319" end="00:54:34.000" style="s2">right that the individual arises from</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.319" end="00:54:35.760" style="s2">the collective and vice versa</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.000" end="00:54:37.200" style="s2">so seeing them more as a continuum</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.760" end="00:54:40.079" style="s2">rather as an</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.200" end="00:54:41.200" style="s2">antithesis um to collectivity or</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.079" end="00:54:42.960" style="s2">progressive values</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.200" end="00:54:45.200" style="s2">i think is helpful right like we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.960" end="00:54:46.799" style="s2">want to eliminate individuality we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.200" end="00:54:48.079" style="s2">want to eliminate personal</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.799" end="00:54:51.920" style="s2">responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.079" end="00:54:53.440" style="s2">it&#39;s recognizing like a healthier left</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.920" end="00:54:54.960" style="s2">is not</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.440" end="00:54:56.559" style="s2">and this doesn&#39;t always happen right</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.960" end="00:54:57.599" style="s2">because they&#39;re the back and forth is</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.559" end="00:55:00.559" style="s2">always going on</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.599" end="00:55:02.480" style="s2">but a healthier left is recognizing that</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.559" end="00:55:06.000" style="s2">individuals are individuals</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.480" end="00:55:08.880" style="s2">within a rhizomatic strata of becoming</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.000" end="00:55:10.319" style="s2">right that that you are a cell within</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.880" end="00:55:12.000" style="s2">this larger organism</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.319" end="00:55:14.000" style="s2">and you have your own domain of</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.000" end="00:55:14.720" style="s2">individuality and autonomy but you have</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.000" end="00:55:17.520" style="s2">it because</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.720" end="00:55:19.520" style="s2">of everything that has coalesced to</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.520" end="00:55:20.079" style="s2">allow you to become and have that</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.520" end="00:55:22.799" style="s2">freedom</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.079" end="00:55:24.319" style="s2">right that agency so and this is</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.799" end="00:55:26.000" style="s2">something that margulis talks about</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.319" end="00:55:28.960" style="s2">quite a bit in her</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.000" end="00:55:31.200" style="s2">her biology or talked about um the</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.960" end="00:55:31.920" style="s2">autonomy and the agency of a single</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.200" end="00:55:33.440" style="s2">organism</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.920" end="00:55:35.760" style="s2">is tremendously important for the</p>

<p begin="00:55:36.720" end="00:55:41.920" style="s2">life what a cell decides to do what what</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.760" end="00:55:43.920" style="s2">a cell decides to do with its own agency</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.920" end="00:55:46.880" style="s2">its own subjectivity</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.920" end="00:55:48.079" style="s2">is just as important as the more</p>

<p begin="00:55:48.079" end="00:55:52.240" style="s2">let&#39;s say collective forces of this</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.079" end="00:55:54.000" style="s2">random genetic mutation etc there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.240" end="00:55:55.839" style="s2">epigenetic there&#39;s creative there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:55:55.839" end="00:55:59.599" style="s2">so i would kind of i would kind of see</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.599" end="00:56:00.480" style="s2">the right and in this regard as sort of</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.599" end="00:56:03.520" style="s2">the agentic</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.480" end="00:56:04.960" style="s2">elements of our own subjectivity our own</p>

<p begin="00:56:09.119" end="00:56:13.440" style="s2">extent</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.760" end="00:56:15.119" style="s2">right but obviously if you cut off the</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.440" end="00:56:16.640" style="s2">individual from the whole</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.119" end="00:56:18.799" style="s2">then you don&#39;t have the individual</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.640" end="00:56:20.079" style="s2">anymore you lose the the conditions that</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.799" end="00:56:22.640" style="s2">create</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.079" end="00:56:23.280" style="s2">that person standing up with their back</p>

<p begin="00:56:23.280" end="00:56:26.799" style="s2">right and that&#39;s the side the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.200" end="00:56:29.680" style="s2">thing that i that i heard quite a bit</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.799" end="00:56:31.359" style="s2">um i talked about with brooks as well</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.680" end="00:56:34.720" style="s2">during the whole peterson</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.359" end="00:56:36.640" style="s2">uh it&#39;s popularity explosion that uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.720" end="00:56:38.400" style="s2">cleaning your room and making sure your</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.640" end="00:56:40.400" style="s2">you were taken care of</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.400" end="00:56:41.440" style="s2">um is really kind of only half the</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.400" end="00:56:44.319" style="s2">equation the other half</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.440" end="00:56:46.160" style="s2">is like the individual is also impressed</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.319" end="00:56:47.280" style="s2">upon by their society so if their</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.160" end="00:56:49.280" style="s2">society is sick</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.280" end="00:56:51.839" style="s2">if there&#39;s social phenomena that create</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.280" end="00:56:53.040" style="s2">illness um that creates certain mental</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.839" end="00:56:55.359" style="s2">illness etc</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.040" end="00:56:56.240" style="s2">depression these aren&#39;t just individual</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.359" end="00:56:57.760" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.240" end="00:57:00.240" style="s2">they have to you have to see it as a</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.760" end="00:57:01.280" style="s2">continuum so i guess that&#39;s how i would</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.240" end="00:57:03.839" style="s2">see it that</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.280" end="00:57:05.599" style="s2">they aren&#39;t antithetical so much as they</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.839" end="00:57:07.200" style="s2">have a relationship to the whole and</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.599" end="00:57:10.240" style="s2">they arise because of the hole</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.200" end="00:57:12.319" style="s2">right and i think maybe this wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.240" end="00:57:14.319" style="s2">a left position um</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.319" end="00:57:15.760" style="s2">this would just be a human position to</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.319" end="00:57:18.640" style="s2">see that</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.760" end="00:57:20.480" style="s2">mobius strip of individual collective is</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.640" end="00:57:21.119" style="s2">like this is how evolution works this is</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.480" end="00:57:23.359" style="s2">how any</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.119" end="00:57:25.200" style="s2">being is an individual being this is how</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.359" end="00:57:27.040" style="s2">any being is a collective being is this</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.200" end="00:57:28.079" style="s2">mobius strip of individuality and</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.040" end="00:57:30.559" style="s2">collectivity</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.079" end="00:57:32.640" style="s2">agency and then these you know these</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.559" end="00:57:33.520" style="s2">forces that press upon us and mold us a</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.640" end="00:57:37.119" style="s2">certain way</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.520" end="00:57:37.119" style="s2">it&#39;s the sort of dynamic downs</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.119" end="00:57:45.839" style="s2">any follow-up maggie or any comments</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.720" end="00:57:49.680" style="s2">um i mean i really appreciate that that</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.839" end="00:57:51.839" style="s2">view of um yeah it&#39;s a spectrum and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.680" end="00:57:53.839" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of embedded within more and</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.839" end="00:57:55.200" style="s2">more emergent pools or collective</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.839" end="00:57:57.040" style="s2">emergence</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.200" end="00:57:59.680" style="s2">i think i&#39;m just still confused about</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.040" end="00:58:02.960" style="s2">the structural design of that</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.680" end="00:58:06.079" style="s2">like to reconcile the structural</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.960" end="00:58:10.079" style="s2">you know incentivization of economic</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.079" end="00:58:12.720" style="s2">development and the collective</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.079" end="00:58:15.040" style="s2">spiritual consciousness oneness um</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.720" end="00:58:17.440" style="s2">especially when we have existing</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.040" end="00:58:18.160" style="s2">socioeconomic inequality that is so</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.440" end="00:58:21.119" style="s2">deeply</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.160" end="00:58:22.000" style="s2">interconnected with race and you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.119" end="00:58:25.520" style="s2">all of these identity</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.000" end="00:58:27.119" style="s2">politics that is material and real so</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.520" end="00:58:28.480" style="s2">i&#39;m just more curious i think about the</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.119" end="00:58:29.680" style="s2">system i critique all that and that</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.480" end="00:58:32.880" style="s2">philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.680" end="00:58:34.400" style="s2">conception it&#39;s really helpful sure</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.880" end="00:58:36.559" style="s2">yeah i&#39;ll just briefly say i know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.400" end="00:58:38.480" style="s2">at the top of the hour that um</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.559" end="00:58:40.160" style="s2">that they think there are like concrete</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.480" end="00:58:41.280" style="s2">models that we can look at and think</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.160" end="00:58:42.880" style="s2">about adapting</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.280" end="00:58:45.520" style="s2">in places like the united states</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.880" end="00:58:46.799" style="s2">obviously um but i really like thomas</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.520" end="00:58:50.000" style="s2">bjorkman&#39;s whole</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.799" end="00:58:52.640" style="s2">um bildung or</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.000" end="00:58:54.240" style="s2">the the sort of self-realization process</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.640" end="00:58:55.839" style="s2">that a collectivist society</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.240" end="00:58:57.680" style="s2">you know a more socialist-oriented</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.839" end="00:59:00.880" style="s2">society actually</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.680" end="00:59:02.880" style="s2">endorses and puts into practice so</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.880" end="00:59:04.000" style="s2">individual realization becomes very</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.880" end="00:59:05.760" style="s2">important to the well-being</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.000" end="00:59:07.440" style="s2">of the whole and they have institutions</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.760" end="00:59:09.839" style="s2">that put that into place</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.440" end="00:59:11.920" style="s2">so when we&#39;re talking about things like</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.839" end="00:59:12.640" style="s2">health care we&#39;re talking about social</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.920" end="00:59:14.079" style="s2">equity</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.640" end="00:59:16.160" style="s2">and the policies that put that into</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.079" end="00:59:18.240" style="s2">place those aren&#39;t just for the</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.160" end="00:59:19.520" style="s2">collective they also become extremely</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.240" end="00:59:20.559" style="s2">significant for the health and</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.520" end="00:59:22.720" style="s2">resilience of</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.559" end="00:59:24.319" style="s2">and the self-actualization right</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.720" end="00:59:24.960" style="s2">spiritual or otherwise of the of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.319" end="00:59:27.280" style="s2">individual</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.960" end="00:59:28.880" style="s2">my my buddy ryan mcaday is on a kick</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.280" end="00:59:31.200" style="s2">with this kind of synthesis</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.880" end="00:59:33.119" style="s2">of uh uh what these socialist countries</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.200" end="00:59:35.520" style="s2">are doing and bjorkman&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.119" end="00:59:37.680" style="s2">and maybe some ways to translate that</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.520" end="00:59:39.119" style="s2">into the kind of rugged individualism of</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.680" end="00:59:40.480" style="s2">of american culture</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.119" end="00:59:42.079" style="s2">right because i think that is a problem</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.480" end="00:59:43.520" style="s2">we sort of see ourselves as sort of</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.079" end="00:59:46.079" style="s2">going alone</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.520" end="00:59:47.440" style="s2">um and but i would also say that i think</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.079" end="00:59:50.720" style="s2">part of that</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.440" end="00:59:52.000" style="s2">um part of that rugged individualism</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.720" end="00:59:54.000" style="s2">even though it&#39;s been sort of an</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.000" end="00:59:56.799" style="s2">integral component of american culture</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.000" end="01:00:00.160" style="s2">the american imaginary it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.799" end="01:00:03.599" style="s2">um been hyper actualized by</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.160" end="01:00:05.920" style="s2">again the 35 40 years of of um</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.599" end="01:00:07.040" style="s2">the erosion of class and labor politics</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.920" end="01:00:08.960" style="s2">um you know uh</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.040" end="01:00:10.079" style="s2">in that documentary i shared in that uh</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.960" end="01:00:12.559" style="s2">in my article</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.079" end="01:00:13.440" style="s2">that minidoc uh one of the interesting</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.559" end="01:00:16.400" style="s2">things i learned</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.440" end="01:00:17.359" style="s2">was you know when you joined a a union</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.400" end="01:00:19.119" style="s2">for your job</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.359" end="01:00:20.880" style="s2">your union took you to school and made</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.119" end="01:00:22.799" style="s2">you learn about uh</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.880" end="01:00:24.640" style="s2">how politics how economics work what</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.799" end="01:00:25.119" style="s2">your role is in the union what to look</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.640" end="01:00:28.559" style="s2">out for</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.119" end="01:00:30.880" style="s2">on the job etc so you know in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.559" end="01:00:33.760" style="s2">like really practical institutional</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.880" end="01:00:34.960" style="s2">policies we&#39;ve lost quite a lot of that</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.760" end="01:00:36.480" style="s2">social cohesion</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.960" end="01:00:38.799" style="s2">over the past 40 years which again is</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.480" end="01:00:41.359" style="s2">part of that problem of atomization</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.799" end="01:00:42.559" style="s2">so yeah i think i think there&#39;s a lot we</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.359" end="01:00:44.960" style="s2">need to talk about</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.559" end="01:00:45.680" style="s2">and obviously we can&#39;t get to it all</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.960" end="01:00:47.839" style="s2">here and</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.680" end="01:00:49.359" style="s2">i don&#39;t know all of the solutions that</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.839" end="01:00:50.400" style="s2">are emerging on the on the left but this</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.359" end="01:00:52.799" style="s2">is this is the</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.400" end="01:00:55.040" style="s2">like this is the question like okay the</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.799" end="01:00:56.720" style="s2">left is waking up again</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.040" end="01:00:58.640" style="s2">what do we do how do we organize how do</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.720" end="01:01:02.000" style="s2">we actually get traction</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.640" end="01:01:03.760" style="s2">with policy um consciousness raising</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.000" end="01:01:06.160" style="s2">and organization right how do we</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.760" end="01:01:07.119" style="s2">actually have power that&#39;s the question</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.160" end="01:01:08.880" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s sort of where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.119" end="01:01:11.040" style="s2">getting to in terms of like the</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.880" end="01:01:12.799" style="s2">conservative bent and then also this new</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.040" end="01:01:15.760" style="s2">kind of revival of</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.799" end="01:01:16.400" style="s2">socialism or leftism or collectivism</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.760" end="01:01:18.640" style="s2">that is</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.400" end="01:01:20.400" style="s2">re-emerging and integrating again but i</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.640" end="01:01:21.599" style="s2">would look to the history of socialism</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.400" end="01:01:24.400" style="s2">in the united states</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.599" end="01:01:25.920" style="s2">um as just great examples of historical</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.400" end="01:01:27.920" style="s2">precedence i think</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.920" end="01:01:29.760" style="s2">um harvey k has some great writing on</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.920" end="01:01:31.440" style="s2">that um richard wolff</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.760" end="01:01:33.359" style="s2">has some great writing on understanding</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.440" end="01:01:36.839" style="s2">socialism and</p>
