<p begin="00:00:02.510" end="00:00:08.639" style="s2">it requires year-over-year growth</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.450" end="00:00:10.530" style="s2">requires it because your fractional</p>

<p begin="00:00:10.530" end="00:00:13.769" style="s2">than that just interest where the</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.969" end="00:00:16.529" style="s2">monetary supply has to fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.769" end="00:00:18.539" style="s2">expand right then to not debase the</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.529" end="00:00:20.910" style="s2">currency you have to increase the total</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.539" end="00:00:23.189" style="s2">amount of goods and services services</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.910" end="00:00:25.949" style="s2">sit on top of product economies which</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.189" end="00:00:28.890" style="s2">relate to a linear materials economy</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.949" end="00:00:30.000" style="s2">product materials economy which the</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.890" end="00:00:31.910" style="s2">linear materials economy means</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.000" end="00:00:34.290" style="s2">extracting resources from the planet</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.910" end="00:00:37.110" style="s2">under nobley which means devastation of</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.290" end="00:00:39.510" style="s2">ecosystems and things like that and then</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.110" end="00:00:41.340" style="s2">turning them into trash in ways that</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.510" end="00:00:42.960" style="s2">usually consume a good bit of energy</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.340" end="00:00:44.969" style="s2">from dirty sources create a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.960" end="00:00:46.920" style="s2">pollution and externalize harm to people</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.969" end="00:00:48.989" style="s2">environments along the way you know and</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.920" end="00:00:52.410" style="s2">then end with waste so that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.989" end="00:00:55.230" style="s2">exponential growth economy and attached</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.410" end="00:00:57.420" style="s2">to a linear materials economy just</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.230" end="00:01:00.030" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work ongoingly on finite planet</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.420" end="00:01:01.530" style="s2">right it only would work ongoingly on an</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.030" end="00:01:05.189" style="s2">infinite playing field which were not on</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.530" end="00:01:07.920" style="s2">and so that is a fundamentally self</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.189" end="00:01:10.020" style="s2">terminating system it makes plenty of</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.920" end="00:01:12.750" style="s2">sense that when there was just so much</p>

<p begin="00:01:12.750" end="00:01:16.799" style="s2">oil and fish and trees and etc that we</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.000" end="00:01:18.869" style="s2">would do this exponential boom kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.799" end="00:01:21.540" style="s2">thing it&#39;s just that&#39;s not viable</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.869" end="00:01:23.220" style="s2">anymore it also happens to be that the</p>

<p begin="00:01:23.220" end="00:01:27.750" style="s2">really viable in a post growth economic</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.860" end="00:01:30.570" style="s2">system it&#39;s not about net more</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.750" end="00:01:32.640" style="s2">consumption but about using the same</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.570" end="00:01:36.360" style="s2">things in a closed-loop materials</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.640" end="00:01:38.610" style="s2">economy in ever more interesting ways so</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.360" end="00:01:41.880" style="s2">a materials economy that is closed-loop</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.610" end="00:01:44.700" style="s2">post growth and upcycling continuously</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.880" end="00:01:46.229" style="s2">upcycling the technology it takes to do</p>

<p begin="00:01:48.810" end="00:01:52.500" style="s2">same time that we are just now getting</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.310" end="00:01:54.869" style="s2">to the point of self-determination of</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.500" end="00:01:58.759" style="s2">the old system right so we both have to</p>
