<p begin="00:00:06.930" end="00:00:13.889" style="s2">the situation here welcome to the March</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.929" end="00:00:18.390" style="s2">QA glad to see you all here thanks for</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.889" end="00:00:20.490" style="s2">tuning in so let&#39;s see if we can get</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.390" end="00:00:22.529" style="s2">somewhere reasonable today I guess I</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.490" end="00:00:24.930" style="s2">could update you a little bit if you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.529" end="00:00:29.519" style="s2">be interested tell you what has been</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.930" end="00:00:32.099" style="s2">going on my wife Tammy and I came back</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.519" end="00:00:35.040" style="s2">from Australia New Zealand at the end of</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.099" end="00:00:38.129" style="s2">February we had a really good tour there</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.040" end="00:00:41.370" style="s2">I would say about a dozen places maybe</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.129" end="00:00:44.340" style="s2">15 hard to keep track as we went to a</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.370" end="00:00:47.489" style="s2">number of places more than once large</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.340" end="00:00:50.340" style="s2">crowds some of the bigger venues</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.489" end="00:00:52.289" style="s2">Melbourne for example is 5500 people so</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.340" end="00:00:54.239" style="s2">I think that was the biggest audience</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.289" end="00:00:58.680" style="s2">that I had spoken to independently of</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.239" end="00:01:01.649" style="s2">the discussions with sam harris so that</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.680" end="00:01:03.719" style="s2">was very interesting to see that crowds</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.649" end="00:01:05.400" style="s2">of that magnitude would show up got to</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.719" end="00:01:07.619" style="s2">speak at the Sydney Opera House which</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.400" end="00:01:09.360" style="s2">was extremely exciting you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.619" end="00:01:11.520" style="s2">such an iconic building so that was a</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.360" end="00:01:12.900" style="s2">real honor it&#39;s been like that for lots</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.520" end="00:01:14.760" style="s2">of the theaters that I&#39;ve been in you</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.900" end="00:01:17.159" style="s2">know these old iconic buildings that so</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.760" end="00:01:19.650" style="s2">many people have performed in it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.159" end="00:01:21.270" style="s2">a privilege to be able to get backstage</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.650" end="00:01:23.820" style="s2">and take a look</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.270" end="00:01:27.600" style="s2">we enjoyed Australia and New Zealand a</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.820" end="00:01:30.060" style="s2">lot the company tagged a tea that hosted</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.600" end="00:01:34.049" style="s2">it hosted the tour did an outstanding</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.060" end="00:01:36.060" style="s2">job and the press even was reasonably</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.049" end="00:01:38.159" style="s2">welcoming I would say at least in</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.060" end="00:01:40.350" style="s2">Australia and New Zealand it was a bit</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.159" end="00:01:43.590" style="s2">of a different story they seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.350" end="00:01:47.670" style="s2">more polarized there as recent events</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.590" end="00:01:50.009" style="s2">have clearly indicated so since I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.670" end="00:01:53.549" style="s2">been back well I haven&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.009" end="00:01:56.310" style="s2">particularly productive I&#39;ve mostly been</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.549" end="00:02:00.270" style="s2">sleeping as it turns out so I guess I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.310" end="00:02:03.479" style="s2">worn out after a year of touring but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.270" end="00:02:06.149" style="s2">hard at work on my next book tentatively</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.479" end="00:02:08.970" style="s2">entitled beyond order or beyond mere</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.149" end="00:02:11.009" style="s2">order twelve more rules for life I&#39;m up</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.970" end="00:02:13.050" style="s2">to chapter nine and I would say I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.009" end="00:02:14.940" style="s2">pretty stuck on it at the moment I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.050" end="00:02:17.760" style="s2">I&#39;m having a hard time slogging through</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.940" end="00:02:20.700" style="s2">it brain isn&#39;t as sharp as it could be</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.760" end="00:02:23.130" style="s2">and have to be sharp to edit so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.700" end="00:02:26.070" style="s2">some set up some new offices this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.130" end="00:02:28.800" style="s2">this week to get my team together for</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.070" end="00:02:31.530" style="s2">the online education project so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.800" end="00:02:34.440" style="s2">exciting about five of us that will be</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.530" end="00:02:37.230" style="s2">working together in some offices with a</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.440" end="00:02:42.540" style="s2">company called post media who I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.230" end="00:02:47.760" style="s2">working with writing journal newspaper</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.540" end="00:02:50.910" style="s2">articles so that&#39;s exciting and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.760" end="00:02:55.320" style="s2">hoping for good things from the online</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.910" end="00:02:56.040" style="s2">education program no timelines or</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.320" end="00:02:58.290" style="s2">anything like that</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.040" end="00:02:59.880" style="s2">still it&#39;s a complicated system I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.290" end="00:03:01.590" style="s2">been working as well on the patreon</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.880" end="00:03:03.720" style="s2">replacement that&#39;s looking really good I</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.590" end="00:03:07.860" style="s2">would say I met with the developer this</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.720" end="00:03:10.050" style="s2">week we&#39;re hoping well we&#39;re hoping to</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.860" end="00:03:11.780" style="s2">have some of it functional by April 1st</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.050" end="00:03:14.310" style="s2">and they&#39;ll be a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.780" end="00:03:18.660" style="s2">information about that available act on</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.310" end="00:03:21.840" style="s2">April 1st I have a talk in New York on</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.660" end="00:03:24.930" style="s2">April 17th at the Beacon Theater I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.840" end="00:03:29.100" style="s2">it&#39;s sold out I have a talk on April</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.930" end="00:03:31.470" style="s2">19th at the Sony Centre in Toronto with</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.100" end="00:03:34.620" style="s2">Slava Dziedzic who&#39;s probably the</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.470" end="00:03:38.660" style="s2">world&#39;s most famous Marxist philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.620" end="00:03:42.090" style="s2">and so that should be interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.660" end="00:03:44.580" style="s2">challenging and hopefully productive and</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.090" end="00:03:47.250" style="s2">then for those of you who might be</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.580" end="00:03:50.040" style="s2">watching from the UK or from somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.250" end="00:03:52.620" style="s2">reasonably accessible to the UK I am</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.040" end="00:03:56.790" style="s2">doing at 12 rules for life lecture tour</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.620" end="00:03:59.100" style="s2">show may 8th in London which is the same</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.790" end="00:04:01.860" style="s2">time that the paperback version of 12</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.100" end="00:04:04.770" style="s2">rules for life is coming up so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.860" end="00:04:08.280" style="s2">basically that for updates</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.770" end="00:04:14.519" style="s2">I guess now maybe there&#39;s a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.280" end="00:04:16.109" style="s2">i&#39;ve videotaped a number of my lectures</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.519" end="00:04:17.970" style="s2">in australia which is the first time</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.109" end="00:04:20.850" style="s2">i&#39;ve done that professionally videotaped</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.970" end="00:04:23.850" style="s2">them I think I taped six and so we&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.850" end="00:04:25.979" style="s2">releasing them in some form yet to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.850" end="00:04:26.430" style="s2">determined maybe on the new platform in</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.979" end="00:04:28.410" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.430" end="00:04:33.350" style="s2">relatively new future and I have about</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.410" end="00:04:35.699" style="s2">50 of them 55 of them audio taped and</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.350" end="00:04:37.289" style="s2">transcribed and so I&#39;ve put together the</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.699" end="00:04:39.919" style="s2">transcriptions it&#39;s about a million</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.289" end="00:04:42.720" style="s2">words and I&#39;m hoping that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.919" end="00:04:44.130" style="s2">possibly books I can derive from that</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.720" end="00:04:45.870" style="s2">but if there&#39;s not folks there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.130" end="00:04:49.680" style="s2">certainly podcasts and that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.870" end="00:04:53.520" style="s2">thing so and I have a lot of interviews</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.680" end="00:04:56.460" style="s2">coming up as well so that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.520" end="00:05:00.060" style="s2">happening on this end of the universe</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.460" end="00:05:00.919" style="s2">so let&#39;s take some questions and see how</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.060" end="00:05:04.130" style="s2">that goes</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.919" end="00:05:06.720" style="s2">so I don&#39;t know why this question is so</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.130" end="00:05:09.320" style="s2">popular but and it&#39;s completely</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.720" end="00:05:12.449" style="s2">ridiculous but that&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.320" end="00:05:14.340" style="s2">Stephen shudders who obviously hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.449" end="00:05:16.919" style="s2">got anything better to do</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.340" end="00:05:20.520" style="s2">wants to know what is my favorite soup</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.919" end="00:05:23.550" style="s2">and apparently 333 people are also</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.520" end="00:05:26.449" style="s2">interested in that particular topic and</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.550" end="00:05:29.210" style="s2">I would say it&#39;s actually irrelevant</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.449" end="00:05:33.659" style="s2">unfortunately because I don&#39;t eat soup</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.210" end="00:05:35.669" style="s2">I&#39;m on this crazy on meat diet that some</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.659" end="00:05:40.050" style="s2">of you know about and that doesn&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.669" end="00:05:42.599" style="s2">along very well with soup but if I had</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.050" end="00:05:44.970" style="s2">to pick a soup that I ate at one point</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.599" end="00:05:48.810" style="s2">my favorite soup was a clam chowder that</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.970" end="00:05:51.000" style="s2">I used to make with corn and I was a</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.810" end="00:05:53.370" style="s2">dish I was particularly proud of I was</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.000" end="00:05:55.110" style="s2">actually not a bad cook I spent a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.370" end="00:05:57.419" style="s2">time cooking in restaurants and really</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.110" end="00:06:01.169" style="s2">enjoyed it and miss it a lot the</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.419" end="00:06:05.550" style="s2">diversity you know of cuisine and so it</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.169" end="00:06:07.169" style="s2">would have to be clam chowder so now you</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.550" end="00:06:12.000" style="s2">know the most important thing about me</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.169" end="00:06:13.770" style="s2">that you could possibly know when will</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.000" end="00:06:18.020" style="s2">you be starting back up your Bible</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.770" end="00:06:20.970" style="s2">series well that&#39;s a good question and</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.020" end="00:06:24.900" style="s2">it looks like it&#39;ll be the fall now</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.970" end="00:06:27.650" style="s2">what&#39;s happening in October is that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.900" end="00:06:30.599" style="s2">going to Cambridge University in the UK</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.650" end="00:06:32.699" style="s2">for two months and I&#39;m going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.599" end="00:06:34.950" style="s2">visiting fellow there at the Divinity</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.699" end="00:06:37.349" style="s2">School and that should give me an</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.950" end="00:06:39.120" style="s2">opportunity to talk to religious experts</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.349" end="00:06:40.409" style="s2">of all types for a couple of months as</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.120" end="00:06:43.289" style="s2">well as students</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.409" end="00:06:46.369" style="s2">and the plan at the moment is to do that</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.289" end="00:06:51.779" style="s2">at the same time that I start recording</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.369" end="00:06:54.059" style="s2">the lectures on Exodus so I figured I</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.779" end="00:06:56.550" style="s2">could kill two birds with one stone that</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.059" end="00:06:57.989" style="s2">way I could start the biblical lectures</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.550" end="00:07:02.159" style="s2">again which I&#39;m really looking forward</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.989" end="00:07:04.199" style="s2">to and also update my biblical knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.159" end="00:07:06.419" style="s2">substantially as well as having the</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.199" end="00:07:08.399" style="s2">opportunity to spend some time in</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.419" end="00:07:10.529" style="s2">Cambridge which I think would be really</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.399" end="00:07:12.409" style="s2">exciting I was there a little bit this</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.529" end="00:07:15.509" style="s2">summer and it&#39;s known absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.409" end="00:07:17.159" style="s2">beautiful University and it&#39;s quite a</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.509" end="00:07:20.159" style="s2">thrill for someone who&#39;s academically</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.159" end="00:07:24.499" style="s2">minded to be to be their period but also</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.159" end="00:07:27.869" style="s2">to be invited there too to sit in and</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.499" end="00:07:32.069" style="s2">participate for a couple of months and</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.869" end="00:07:34.739" style="s2">so anyways maybe I can get 10 or so</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.069" end="00:07:36.569" style="s2">lectures out in that period of time</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.739" end="00:07:38.069" style="s2">let&#39;s say if I did one a week I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.569" end="00:07:40.169" style="s2">exactly sure how I&#39;m going to do it if</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.069" end="00:07:42.569" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna rent a public theater like I</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.169" end="00:07:43.919" style="s2">did in Toronto I think that&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.569" end="00:07:46.949" style="s2">the plan</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.919" end="00:07:49.979" style="s2">but anyways assume October or November</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.949" end="00:07:52.050" style="s2">that&#39;s the that&#39;s the plan at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.979" end="00:07:56.399" style="s2">what I&#39;m trying to concentrate on right</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.050" end="00:08:00.089" style="s2">now is finishing my new book which has a</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.399" end="00:08:02.249" style="s2">relatively sudden or you know relatively</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.089" end="00:08:05.399" style="s2">it has a due date that&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.249" end="00:08:07.199" style="s2">relatively recent future and so I like</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.399" end="00:08:08.550" style="s2">to stay on top of those things it&#39;s easy</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.199" end="00:08:11.429" style="s2">to get behind when you&#39;re writing a book</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.550" end="00:08:13.499" style="s2">and to rush it and to do it badly and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.429" end="00:08:16.800" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to make sure that I&#39;ve got my</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.499" end="00:08:19.979" style="s2">priorities straight so anyways that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.800" end="00:08:22.139" style="s2">the situation with the biblical series</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.979" end="00:08:24.029" style="s2">I&#39;m really looking forward to it I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.139" end="00:08:26.249" style="s2">one of the most worthwhile things I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.029" end="00:08:28.889" style="s2">done in my academic career was that</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.249" end="00:08:30.779" style="s2">series on Genesis and I learned a</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.889" end="00:08:32.099" style="s2">tremendous amount and so I&#39;m assuming</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.779" end="00:08:35.849" style="s2">the same thing will happen with the</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.099" end="00:08:39.629" style="s2">Exodus stories which I know better so</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.849" end="00:08:41.759" style="s2">that should be slightly easier on me</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.629" end="00:08:43.439" style="s2">from a rate of learning perspective and</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.759" end="00:08:45.059" style="s2">hopefully I&#39;ll be able to go deeper</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.439" end="00:08:49.339" style="s2">because they are really remarkable</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.059" end="00:08:52.079" style="s2">stories so I&#39;ve also been struck by the</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.339" end="00:08:55.430" style="s2">you know the reception to those biblical</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.079" end="00:08:55.430" style="s2">stories I&#39;ve read</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.529" end="00:09:02.079" style="s2">surprising number for example of a</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.809" end="00:09:03.850" style="s2">surprising number for example of letters</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.079" end="00:09:05.499" style="s2">from Islamic viewers who&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.850" end="00:09:08.559" style="s2">watching them and the letters have been</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.499" end="00:09:10.839" style="s2">very positive and so that&#39;s that&#39;s made</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.559" end="00:09:13.420" style="s2">me think very hard about the overall</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.839" end="00:09:16.240" style="s2">potential effect of delineating the</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.420" end="00:09:18.939" style="s2">meaning of all these old stories I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.240" end="00:09:20.949" style="s2">that to the degree that we want to</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.939" end="00:09:24.569" style="s2">preserve the understructure of our</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.949" end="00:09:26.559" style="s2">culture and I regard that as grounded in</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.569" end="00:09:28.779" style="s2">judeo-christian tradition very very</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.559" end="00:09:32.559" style="s2">firmly as well as other traditions</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.779" end="00:09:36.459" style="s2">obviously the greco-roman tradition</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.559" end="00:09:38.439" style="s2">probably foremost among them the stories</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.459" end="00:09:39.879" style="s2">have to be brought alive again and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.439" end="00:09:42.339" style="s2">don&#39;t think there&#39;s any more effective</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.879" end="00:09:46.949" style="s2">way of demonstrating their utility than</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.339" end="00:09:50.980" style="s2">to make them come alive Mir what your</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.949" end="00:09:53.019" style="s2">profession of belief and value isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.980" end="00:09:54.759" style="s2">sufficient one thing you might guys</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.019" end="00:09:58.929" style="s2">might be interested in to it this is a</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.759" end="00:10:01.949" style="s2">video or a an audio I think I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.929" end="00:10:05.259" style="s2">if I videotaped this one or just audio</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.949" end="00:10:08.079" style="s2">recorded it I did a lecture in Australia</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.259" end="00:10:10.089" style="s2">on this question about belief in God and</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.079" end="00:10:12.790" style="s2">why I&#39;m not very happy about the</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.089" end="00:10:17.230" style="s2">question and unwilling in some sense to</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.790" end="00:10:20.139" style="s2">answer it so I did in to our snow 70</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.230" end="00:10:23.410" style="s2">minute lecture on how that question why</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.139" end="00:10:24.459" style="s2">that question is problematic for me and</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.410" end="00:10:26.980" style="s2">what can be done about it</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.459" end="00:10:29.379" style="s2">what what the proper answer is to it I</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.980" end="00:10:31.360" style="s2">think so hopefully you&#39;ll find something</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.379" end="00:10:32.980" style="s2">interesting in that when it&#39;s finally</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.360" end="00:10:41.290" style="s2">released</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.980" end="00:10:43.179" style="s2">I do not attend church how can I teach</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.290" end="00:10:45.819" style="s2">my children the biblical stories in a</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.179" end="00:10:48.009" style="s2">productive way without the dogma or</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.819" end="00:10:53.230" style="s2">little and literal interpretation of</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.009" end="00:10:56.259" style="s2">organized religion well that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.230" end="00:10:59.019" style="s2">unbelievably complicated problem and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.259" end="00:11:00.970" style="s2">actually don&#39;t know the answer to it I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.019" end="00:11:03.429" style="s2">not sure that I did a particularly good</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.970" end="00:11:05.259" style="s2">job of teaching my children the biblical</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.429" end="00:11:07.089" style="s2">stories in a productive way without the</p>

<p begin="00:11:12.160" end="00:11:16.900" style="s2">just reading them the stories you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.080" end="00:11:19.750" style="s2">there are decent plain English</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.900" end="00:11:22.450" style="s2">translations of the biblical stories and</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.750" end="00:11:23.800" style="s2">you might find that just reading the</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.450" end="00:11:26.530" style="s2">stories to them at least they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.800" end="00:11:28.690" style="s2">familiar with them that way and you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.530" end="00:11:30.040" style="s2">have to pick and choose obviously</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.690" end="00:11:31.450" style="s2">because they&#39;re not going to be too</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.040" end="00:11:35.440" style="s2">thrilled by sitting through endless</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.450" end="00:11:39.610" style="s2">genealogies but there are also biblical</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.440" end="00:11:42.040" style="s2">translations available that put the</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.610" end="00:11:43.750" style="s2">stories out in prose form and do a</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.040" end="00:11:45.490" style="s2">pretty good job of editing out the</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.750" end="00:11:48.550" style="s2">genealogical material and the other</p>

<p begin="00:11:51.030" end="00:11:55.630" style="s2">particularly well I can&#39;t think of any</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.800" end="00:11:58.060" style="s2">better way of doing it than just reading</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.630" end="00:11:59.680" style="s2">the stories to them and perhaps to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.060" end="00:12:01.270" style="s2">degree that it&#39;s possible to discuss</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.680" end="00:12:05.080" style="s2">them and see if that works</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.270" end="00:12:08.010" style="s2">maybe it&#39;ll work maybe it won&#39;t I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.080" end="00:12:10.480" style="s2">didn&#39;t take my kids to church you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.010" end="00:12:13.270" style="s2">having stopped attending really when I</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.480" end="00:12:15.610" style="s2">was 13 and I have my reasons for not</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.270" end="00:12:18.640" style="s2">attending maybe they&#39;re good and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.610" end="00:12:21.700" style="s2">they&#39;re not I very back and forth with</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.640" end="00:12:23.650" style="s2">that one of the downsides of that was</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.700" end="00:12:25.570" style="s2">that though they didn&#39;t develop the same</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.650" end="00:12:27.700" style="s2">familiarity with the stories that I had</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.570" end="00:12:29.560" style="s2">developed when I was a kid because I did</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.700" end="00:12:35.130" style="s2">go to church fairly regularly until I</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.560" end="00:12:35.130" style="s2">was 13 and it&#39;s it&#39;s definitely a loss</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.220" end="00:12:42.040" style="s2">my cynicism about church organization</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.590" end="00:12:47.920" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s cynicism I don&#39;t know what it</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.040" end="00:12:49.690" style="s2">is exactly well I didn&#39;t do my</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.920" end="00:12:54.400" style="s2">children&#39;s education on the biblical</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.690" end="00:12:56.290" style="s2">front any good so I&#39;m still at sixes and</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.400" end="00:12:57.640" style="s2">sevens let&#39;s say about that and about</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.290" end="00:12:59.290" style="s2">exactly what to do about it but you</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.640" end="00:13:00.520" style="s2">could try reading I&#39;m reading the</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.290" end="00:13:02.050" style="s2">stories to them and see how that goes</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.520" end="00:13:03.340" style="s2">and there are children&#39;s versions</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.050" end="00:13:05.980" style="s2">available as well you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.340" end="00:13:08.140" style="s2">suspect if you look carefully on Amazon</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.980" end="00:13:10.060" style="s2">you could find ones that were well</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.140" end="00:13:16.840" style="s2">reviewed and so that might be another</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.060" end="00:13:20.529" style="s2">way of approaching it what question are</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.840" end="00:13:24.939" style="s2">you asked way too seldom</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.529" end="00:13:28.179" style="s2">oh well that&#39;s pretty easy at least if</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.939" end="00:13:31.919" style="s2">if the question is what question am I</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.179" end="00:13:37.449" style="s2">asked by journalists way too seldom and</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.919" end="00:13:41.379" style="s2">the answer to that would be dr. Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.449" end="00:13:44.769" style="s2">what the hell is going on and what I</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.379" end="00:13:46.599" style="s2">mean by that is why are so many people</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.769" end="00:13:48.969" style="s2">coming to your lectures let&#39;s say and</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.599" end="00:13:50.709" style="s2">why did your book strike such a chord I</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.969" end="00:13:52.779" style="s2">think the first one is the most</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.709" end="00:13:56.949" style="s2">important one you know generally what</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.779" end="00:14:00.989" style="s2">happens with with journalists is that</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.949" end="00:14:03.279" style="s2">they&#39;re very cynical about what is</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.989" end="00:14:08.069" style="s2">happening at my lectures and also who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.279" end="00:14:08.069" style="s2">attending and it&#39;s really very</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.189" end="00:14:21.309" style="s2">pejorative demeaning thoughtless</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.109" end="00:14:24.279" style="s2">prejudiced and I would say cruel all at</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.309" end="00:14:27.539" style="s2">once because the first assumption is</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.279" end="00:14:33.549" style="s2">that you know I&#39;m talking primarily to</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.539" end="00:14:36.099" style="s2">angry white young man and there</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.549" end="00:14:38.739" style="s2">certainly isn&#39;t a lot of evidence for</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.099" end="00:14:43.029" style="s2">that I would say the average age of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.739" end="00:14:45.970" style="s2">people in my audience is 30s and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.029" end="00:14:49.179" style="s2">not exactly young and then I would say</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.970" end="00:14:50.949" style="s2">well it&#39;s at least 30% women and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.179" end="00:14:54.249" style="s2">been increasing as the book has sold</p>

<p begin="00:14:54.249" end="00:15:01.569" style="s2">primarily to begin with I think is</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.739" end="00:15:05.349" style="s2">because well there are many men starving</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.569" end="00:15:07.839" style="s2">for an encouraging voice and also the</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.349" end="00:15:09.699" style="s2">fact that YouTube which is where I</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.839" end="00:15:12.519" style="s2">picked up my primary audience to begin</p>

<p begin="00:15:14.859" end="00:15:19.689" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have anything to do with me</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.359" end="00:15:21.639" style="s2">right that&#39;s just a what do you call</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.689" end="00:15:23.859" style="s2">that that&#39;s a baseline phenomena that</p>

<p begin="00:15:31.419" end="00:15:36.400" style="s2">but the presumption is is that you</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.390" end="00:15:39.220" style="s2">I&#39;m speaking politically and in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.400" end="00:15:43.980" style="s2">divisive way to the people who show up</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.220" end="00:15:47.410" style="s2">to my to my lectures into my talks and</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.980" end="00:15:50.700" style="s2">I&#39;m just not true the lectures aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.410" end="00:15:54.040" style="s2">political except peripherally I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.700" end="00:15:58.050" style="s2">now and then throw a critical comment or</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.040" end="00:16:02.460" style="s2">two out about the manner in which this</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.050" end="00:16:05.380" style="s2">strange alliance of post-modernism and</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.460" end="00:16:07.330" style="s2">neo Marxism has been dominating the</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.380" end="00:16:09.880" style="s2">university but I think that&#39;s perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.330" end="00:16:12.600" style="s2">reasonable thing to point out apart from</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.880" end="00:16:15.370" style="s2">that the lecture is almost all</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.600" end="00:16:17.440" style="s2">concentrate on psychological</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.370" end="00:16:20.050" style="s2">self-improvement and it seems almost</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.440" end="00:16:23.470" style="s2">impossible for the media to be not</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.050" end="00:16:25.300" style="s2">cynical about that you know I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.470" end="00:16:27.490" style="s2">partly because almost everything that</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.300" end="00:16:29.920" style="s2">the classic media covers has to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.490" end="00:16:33.310" style="s2">politicized and I was on a show for</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.920" end="00:16:35.140" style="s2">example called Q&amp;A in Australian show</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.310" end="00:16:37.660" style="s2">which was it&#39;s their biggest political</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.140" end="00:16:39.640" style="s2">show it&#39;s modeled on one in the UK which</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.660" end="00:16:42.970" style="s2">is also quite big which I was also on a</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.640" end="00:16:46.360" style="s2">while back and every issue immediately</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.970" end="00:16:49.030" style="s2">becomes discussed among polarized</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.360" end="00:16:50.920" style="s2">political lines it&#39;s as if our discourse</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.030" end="00:16:54.040" style="s2">has degenerated to the point where the</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.920" end="00:16:56.350" style="s2">only possible response to a question</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.040" end="00:16:59.470" style="s2">about anything important has to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.350" end="00:17:02.290" style="s2">ideological so left or right and it has</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.470" end="00:17:05.470" style="s2">to be political and so I think part of</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.290" end="00:17:09.030" style="s2">the problem is perhaps that the</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.470" end="00:17:11.140" style="s2">phenomenon that constitutes the</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.030" end="00:17:14.949" style="s2">attendance at my lectures</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.140" end="00:17:19.990" style="s2">doesn&#39;t fit the standard news media</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.949" end="00:17:22.860" style="s2">narrative which is driven by journalists</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.990" end="00:17:25.030" style="s2">I think who had political ambitions</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.860" end="00:17:27.010" style="s2">fundamentally or still have political</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.030" end="00:17:29.740" style="s2">ambitions of one sort or another and who</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.010" end="00:17:33.690" style="s2">tend to view worldly through a political</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.740" end="00:17:36.550" style="s2">means but for me the experience of my</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.690" end="00:17:40.120" style="s2">lectures is actually an unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.550" end="00:17:41.950" style="s2">positive one and and not particularly</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.120" end="00:17:45.610" style="s2">stressful like it&#39;s nowhere near as</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.950" end="00:17:48.310" style="s2">stressful as almost any interview I have</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.610" end="00:17:50.620" style="s2">with almost any journalist</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.310" end="00:17:53.110" style="s2">because again things get politicized</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.620" end="00:17:55.930" style="s2">very rapidly what happens in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.110" end="00:17:58.810" style="s2">lectures is that you know 3,000 people</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.930" end="00:18:00.550" style="s2">show up and they&#39;re happy to be there</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.810" end="00:18:05.500" style="s2">and so it&#39;s a very welcoming atmosphere</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.550" end="00:18:08.530" style="s2">and I get to talk to them for 70 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.500" end="00:18:10.450" style="s2">about some psychological problem I would</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.530" end="00:18:12.850" style="s2">say often associated with one of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.450" end="00:18:17.020" style="s2">chapters in my book like what it means</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.850" end="00:18:19.290" style="s2">to what what a human competence</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.020" end="00:18:22.660" style="s2">hierarchy might look like say if I was</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.290" end="00:18:25.450" style="s2">talking about chapter 1 because we do</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.660" end="00:18:27.280" style="s2">organize hierarchies human beings</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.450" end="00:18:28.960" style="s2">naturally organize hierarchies like</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.280" end="00:18:31.510" style="s2">other animals too but we tend to</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.960" end="00:18:34.390" style="s2">organize hierarchies to achieve valuable</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.510" end="00:18:37.870" style="s2">goals you know valuable in that their</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.390" end="00:18:41.080" style="s2">goals that people assume would be</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.870" end="00:18:42.970" style="s2">usefully achieved to decrease the some</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.080" end="00:18:44.620" style="s2">amount of suffering in the world or</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.970" end="00:18:47.350" style="s2">maybe to bring happiness to people or a</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.620" end="00:18:49.480" style="s2">bit of luxury or something generally</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.350" end="00:18:52.360" style="s2">something of at least limited use and</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.480" end="00:18:55.390" style="s2">often far more than limited you know and</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.360" end="00:18:57.370" style="s2">I talked to people about the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.390" end="00:18:59.530" style="s2">the best way to make progress in human</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.370" end="00:19:02.680" style="s2">hierarchy has nothing to do with power</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.530" end="00:19:06.070" style="s2">but everything to do with reciprocity</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.680" end="00:19:09.370" style="s2">and responsibility I just read this or</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.070" end="00:19:11.560" style="s2">watched this really cool TED talk I</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.370" end="00:19:17.350" style="s2">think it was a TED talk by friends de</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.560" end="00:19:20.260" style="s2">Waal FR ANS de wal and he studied</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.350" end="00:19:25.480" style="s2">political behavior in chimpanzees so I</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.260" end="00:19:27.910" style="s2">wish I had the URL for it maybe somebody</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.480" end="00:19:29.680" style="s2">can post that if they would but one of</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.910" end="00:19:33.750" style="s2">the things that do all pointed out was</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.680" end="00:19:36.640" style="s2">that the most impact</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.750" end="00:19:38.860" style="s2">chimpanzees in a chimpanzee troop are</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.640" end="00:19:40.750" style="s2">actually the dominant the most dominant</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.860" end="00:19:43.060" style="s2">males they&#39;re the ones who do the most</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.750" end="00:19:45.460" style="s2">comforting and the most care like the</p>

<p begin="00:19:45.460" end="00:19:50.680" style="s2">on average but across all of the</p>

<p begin="00:19:52.240" end="00:19:58.630" style="s2">responses and that&#39;s part of their walls</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.640" end="00:20:00.850" style="s2">and he&#39;s not the only animal ethologist</p>

<p begin="00:20:03.820" end="00:20:09.490" style="s2">sort of thing out you know is that the</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.490" end="00:20:12.370" style="s2">ability to move forward in a hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.490" end="00:20:15.220" style="s2">is dependent on far more than power and</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.370" end="00:20:17.559" style="s2">aggression and it&#39;s dependent on</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.220" end="00:20:19.690" style="s2">reciprocity and friendship but also</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.559" end="00:20:23.919" style="s2">especially in the case of human beings</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.690" end="00:20:26.110" style="s2">on skill because hopefully when we</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.919" end="00:20:28.450" style="s2">organize our hierarchies and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.110" end="00:20:30.549" style="s2">attempting to solve complex problems by</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.450" end="00:20:33.220" style="s2">setting up a hierarchy that allows for</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.549" end="00:20:35.559" style="s2">competition and cooperation that the</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.220" end="00:20:37.510" style="s2">hierarchy organizes itself so that the</p>

<p begin="00:20:37.510" end="00:20:41.860" style="s2">and I actually think that generally</p>

<p begin="00:20:53.470" end="00:20:58.179" style="s2">might be their attractiveness or their</p>

<p begin="00:22:18.730" end="00:22:23.710" style="s2">I talked to people about taking care of</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.580" end="00:22:26.200" style="s2">themselves like there&#39;s someone who they</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.710" end="00:22:29.110" style="s2">have responsibility for and that&#39;s not a</p>

<p begin="00:22:38.110" end="00:22:43.450" style="s2">manifest itself for you to push yourself</p>

<p begin="00:22:56.500" end="00:23:00.550" style="s2">yourself against it in order for and you</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.080" end="00:23:03.070" style="s2">have to try to do that truthfully and</p>

<p begin="00:23:09.130" end="00:23:15.370" style="s2">that seems like a very positive thing as</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.520" end="00:23:17.680" style="s2">far as I&#39;m concerned to encourage people</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.370" end="00:23:19.510" style="s2">to be responsible for themselves and for</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.680" end="00:23:22.420" style="s2">other people and also to point out that</p>

<p begin="00:23:29.950" end="00:23:36.370" style="s2">has been very helpful to people at least</p>

<p begin="00:23:57.940" end="00:24:02.560" style="s2">also the idea that men and women alike</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.880" end="00:24:05.920" style="s2">are made in the image of God which</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.560" end="00:24:09.610" style="s2">suggests that like God we have the</p>

<p begin="00:26:04.720" end="00:26:09.040" style="s2">it&#39;s so interesting to me that the</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.179" end="00:26:14.650" style="s2">journalists who interview me have no</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.040" end="00:26:16.600" style="s2">curiosity about why it is that so many</p>

<p begin="00:26:19.300" end="00:26:23.740" style="s2">boiled out of them in some sense because</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.340" end="00:26:26.170" style="s2">it certainly makes me curious I&#39;ve every</p>

<p begin="00:26:30.850" end="00:26:34.390" style="s2">they&#39;re there and so we have a</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.740" end="00:26:36.309" style="s2">discussion about all these things that</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.390" end="00:26:37.870" style="s2">I&#39;ve been talking about and I can tell</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.309" end="00:26:40.390" style="s2">you too that the one thing that really</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.870" end="00:26:42.429" style="s2">brings the house to a dead silence which</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.390" end="00:26:46.090" style="s2">is very much worth</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.429" end="00:26:47.889" style="s2">attention to is the discussion anytime I</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.090" end="00:26:50.379" style="s2">have a discussion about the relationship</p>

<p begin="00:26:54.999" end="00:27:00.309" style="s2">maps of meaning is that because life is</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.139" end="00:27:03.999" style="s2">essentially tragic in its fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.309" end="00:27:07.059" style="s2">essence you need a sustaining meaning</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.999" end="00:27:08.740" style="s2">that&#39;s deep and and profound and and</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.059" end="00:27:11.049" style="s2">deep and profound enough to get you</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.740" end="00:27:13.899" style="s2">through bad times because there will be</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.049" end="00:27:16.840" style="s2">very bad times in your life there&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.899" end="00:27:19.210" style="s2">death and they&#39;ll be illness and they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.840" end="00:27:21.519" style="s2">be disappointment of of all sorts and</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.210" end="00:27:23.590" style="s2">and there&#39;ll be just the standard</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.519" end="00:27:26.679" style="s2">difficulties of life in the world to</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.590" end="00:27:30.340" style="s2">contend with and you really must have</p>

<p begin="00:27:30.340" end="00:27:37.509" style="s2">to set up against that and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.940" end="00:27:43.029" style="s2">your voluntary adoption of the struggle</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.509" end="00:27:45.220" style="s2">to improve being is the proper antidote</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.029" end="00:27:47.249" style="s2">to that and and that the best way to do</p>

<p begin="00:27:47.249" end="00:27:54.159" style="s2">truthfully I truly believe that and I</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.450" end="00:27:55.960" style="s2">think that people know this you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.159" end="00:27:58.119" style="s2">because when I talk to my audiences</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.960" end="00:28:01.480" style="s2">about exactly this about who they admire</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.119" end="00:28:03.129" style="s2">for example you know it&#39;s like well you</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.480" end="00:28:04.749" style="s2">don&#39;t admire people who lie and cheat</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.129" end="00:28:06.340" style="s2">and deceive if you don&#39;t teach your</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.749" end="00:28:08.619" style="s2">children to do that</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.340" end="00:28:10.690" style="s2">you admire people who keep their word</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.619" end="00:28:12.220" style="s2">who are honest and reliable and you want</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.690" end="00:28:14.649" style="s2">them around especially in times of</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.220" end="00:28:16.600" style="s2">trouble and you want people who are</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.649" end="00:28:18.340" style="s2">capable of being responsible for</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.600" end="00:28:20.409" style="s2">themselves and to take care of</p>

<p begin="00:28:20.409" end="00:28:26.710" style="s2">a moral duty and then you also want</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.820" end="00:28:28.600" style="s2">people who have extended themselves past</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.710" end="00:28:30.789" style="s2">that so that they can take care of their</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.600" end="00:28:32.919" style="s2">family and regard that as a noble and</p>

<p begin="00:28:36.909" end="00:28:41.860" style="s2">want people who are capable of extending</p>

<p begin="00:28:46.779" end="00:28:51.309" style="s2">meaning in your life if you&#39;re if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.909" end="00:28:53.919" style="s2">looking for it it&#39;s not in happiness and</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.309" end="00:28:56.320" style="s2">it&#39;s not an impulsive pleasure none of</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.919" end="00:28:58.960" style="s2">that works for any length of time</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.320" end="00:29:02.140" style="s2">well it tends to kick back hard and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.960" end="00:29:04.330" style="s2">certainly not something that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.140" end="00:29:07.110" style="s2">get you through rough times it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.330" end="00:29:09.160" style="s2">ability to pick up a heavy load of</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.110" end="00:29:11.800" style="s2">responsibility and to move forward with</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.160" end="00:29:14.140" style="s2">it and what&#39;s so interesting is that</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.800" end="00:29:17.680" style="s2">every time I talk about this with my</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.140" end="00:29:21.220" style="s2">audiences they&#39;re reduced to complete</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.680" end="00:29:23.140" style="s2">silence and there&#39;s I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.220" end="00:29:24.610" style="s2">something and then that&#39;s you know I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.140" end="00:29:26.620" style="s2">noticed that in a hundred and fifty</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.610" end="00:29:28.390" style="s2">different cities now and it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.620" end="00:29:30.190" style="s2">you really have to take seriously when</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.390" end="00:29:32.020" style="s2">you see it happening over and over and I</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.190" end="00:29:34.540" style="s2">do believe that a huge part of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.020" end="00:29:38.580" style="s2">reason that people are coming to watch</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.540" end="00:29:41.140" style="s2">my lectures and to buy my book</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.580" end="00:29:42.850" style="s2">the lectures of course have more direct</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.140" end="00:29:44.260" style="s2">impact on me than the book sales</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.850" end="00:29:46.420" style="s2">although the book sales now have</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.260" end="00:29:49.210" style="s2">approached three million copies which is</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.420" end="00:29:52.060" style="s2">quite something in hardcover around the</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.210" end="00:29:53.530" style="s2">world and they&#39;re not translated into</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.060" end="00:29:55.900" style="s2">all the languages they&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.530" end="00:29:57.870" style="s2">translated into that&#39;s I think 50</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.900" end="00:30:00.730" style="s2">languages is what they&#39;re slated for now</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.870" end="00:30:02.590" style="s2">but the lectures have more impact on me</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.730" end="00:30:04.030" style="s2">because I get to see the audience and</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.590" end="00:30:05.440" style="s2">then to talk to people afterwards you</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.030" end="00:30:08.290" style="s2">know when they tell me the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.440" end="00:30:11.290" style="s2">many people who come up to me in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.290" end="00:30:14.350" style="s2">meet and greets because people can come</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.290" end="00:30:16.150" style="s2">and talk to me after the after the</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.350" end="00:30:19.030" style="s2">lecture there&#39;s special tickets arranged</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.150" end="00:30:21.940" style="s2">for that that&#39;s handled by a particular</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.030" end="00:30:23.770" style="s2">company and they tell me you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.940" end="00:30:25.960" style="s2">they&#39;ve been trying to develop a vision</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.770" end="00:30:27.640" style="s2">for their life and to act more</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.960" end="00:30:29.710" style="s2">responsibility and to speak more</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.640" end="00:30:31.960" style="s2">truthfully and to take more</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.710" end="00:30:34.300" style="s2">responsibility maybe I already said that</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.960" end="00:30:35.950" style="s2">and that the changes in their lives have</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.300" end="00:30:38.800" style="s2">been overwhelming as a consequence</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.950" end="00:30:41.710" style="s2">merely trying to just speak the truth or</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.800" end="00:30:44.200" style="s2">not lie has had a huge effect on many of</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.710" end="00:30:46.120" style="s2">the people that I&#39;ve talked to and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.200" end="00:30:48.220" style="s2">not a simple thing to do you know and</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.120" end="00:30:50.110" style="s2">it&#39;s a risky thing because the</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.220" end="00:30:51.550" style="s2">consequences of speaking the truth in</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.110" end="00:30:53.080" style="s2">the short term especially if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.550" end="00:30:54.640" style="s2">very practiced at it can be quite</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.080" end="00:30:58.540" style="s2">devastating which is of course why</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.640" end="00:31:00.460" style="s2">people don&#39;t do it but the medium to</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.540" end="00:31:02.470" style="s2">long term consequences are extremely</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.460" end="00:31:06.670" style="s2">beneficial and it&#39;s what sets the world</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.470" end="00:31:09.630" style="s2">straight and so what question are you</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.670" end="00:31:09.630" style="s2">asked way too seldom</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.899" end="00:31:14.649" style="s2">well dr. Peterson don&#39;t you think that</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.940" end="00:31:16.389" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting that so many people are</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.649" end="00:31:18.399" style="s2">coming to your lectures that are</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.389" end="00:31:20.979" style="s2">fundamentally psychological and</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.399" end="00:31:22.659" style="s2">philosophical in nature and apparently</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.979" end="00:31:24.279" style="s2">doing so because they&#39;re really trying</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.659" end="00:31:27.279" style="s2">hard to get their lives together it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.279" end="00:31:29.229" style="s2">like yeah I think that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.279" end="00:31:32.769" style="s2">interesting and it&#39;s a question that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.229" end="00:31:34.690" style="s2">really worth pursuing it&#39;s the only</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.769" end="00:31:36.070" style="s2">question that&#39;s worth pursuing as far as</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.690" end="00:31:39.009" style="s2">I&#39;m concerned because it&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.070" end="00:31:41.979" style="s2">mystery that there&#39;s such a demand for</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.009" end="00:31:45.369" style="s2">this I can&#39;t I can&#39;t fathom it I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.979" end="00:31:49.259" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s being a source of tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.369" end="00:31:54.329" style="s2">optimism to me that people have that</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.259" end="00:31:56.529" style="s2">burning desire for a more profound</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.329" end="00:31:58.479" style="s2">dialogue and you know it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.529" end="00:32:01.269" style="s2">necessarily the people that you expect</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.479" end="00:32:03.639" style="s2">to so the journalists you know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.269" end="00:32:06.039" style="s2">very cynical about my hypothetically</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.639" end="00:32:09.249" style="s2">angry audience for example and you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.039" end="00:32:11.709" style="s2">I&#39;ve spoken now to I think three hundred</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.249" end="00:32:13.690" style="s2">and fifty thousand people right three</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.709" end="00:32:15.729" style="s2">hundred and fifty thousand people in a</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.690" end="00:32:19.089" style="s2">hundred and fifty cities and we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.729" end="00:32:22.209" style="s2">had one episode of misbehavior from</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.089" end="00:32:25.929" style="s2">anybody in the audience except for one</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.209" end="00:32:29.200" style="s2">person who stood up in some City and had</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.929" end="00:32:32.529" style="s2">a few you know rebellious things to say</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.200" end="00:32:33.999" style="s2">but they that person wasn&#39;t a partisan</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.529" end="00:32:34.839" style="s2">of mine by any stretch of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.999" end="00:32:39.849" style="s2">imagination</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.839" end="00:32:42.519" style="s2">the lectures of being very very peaceful</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.849" end="00:32:44.349" style="s2">and they&#39;re very very positive and</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.519" end="00:32:47.079" style="s2">that&#39;s part of the reason why I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.349" end="00:32:49.209" style="s2">able to travel around so regularly over</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.079" end="00:32:53.459" style="s2">the last year with my wife and do 150</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.209" end="00:32:55.779" style="s2">lectures you know cuz it&#39;s quite well</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.459" end="00:32:57.039" style="s2">demanding all that traveling and all</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.779" end="00:32:58.839" style="s2">that thinking because each of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.039" end="00:33:00.639" style="s2">lectures is different at least the</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.839" end="00:33:05.159" style="s2">degree that I can make it but they&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.639" end="00:33:10.269" style="s2">positive and it&#39;s so exciting at a</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.159" end="00:33:13.359" style="s2">fundamental level to see people want to</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.269" end="00:33:20.139" style="s2">engage in serious dialogue of that sort</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.359" end="00:33:23.420" style="s2">that it&#39;s unbelievably sustaining let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.139" end="00:33:27.890" style="s2">call it that it makes up for the inner</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.420" end="00:33:29.750" style="s2">to use Australia tired me out I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.890" end="00:33:32.720" style="s2">I&#39;ve maybe did do a bit too much</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.750" end="00:33:34.640" style="s2">travelling around and you know there</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.720" end="00:33:36.770" style="s2">were some other issues in my family that</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.640" end="00:33:38.360" style="s2">had to be dealt with in January and</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.770" end="00:33:40.990" style="s2">March that were quite serious and so</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.360" end="00:33:44.000" style="s2">that was another issue that that was</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.990" end="00:33:46.430" style="s2">draining let&#39;s say but I&#39;ll tell you</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.000" end="00:33:50.180" style="s2">both my wife and I am Dave Rubin - and</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.430" end="00:33:52.250" style="s2">and my tour manager John O&#39;Connell who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.180" end="00:33:54.910" style="s2">been a really good guy you know we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.250" end="00:33:58.070" style="s2">all found this entire experience</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.910" end="00:33:59.570" style="s2">extraordinarily positive and are the</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.070" end="00:34:01.160" style="s2">same thing happens with the people who</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.570" end="00:34:09.050" style="s2">are arranging the tours it&#39;s their</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.160" end="00:34:11.660" style="s2">experiences is the same so how to</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.050" end="00:34:13.880" style="s2">balance between making peace and</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.660" end="00:34:16.640" style="s2">speaking the truth in intimate relations</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.880" end="00:34:18.320" style="s2">what if truth hurts the other or two</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.640" end="00:34:20.080" style="s2">sides conflict well you can be</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.320" end="00:34:23.330" style="s2">absolutely certain that that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.080" end="00:34:25.070" style="s2">happen I mean look the first thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.330" end="00:34:27.770" style="s2">that&#39;s a really good question</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.070" end="00:34:28.910" style="s2">that&#39;s from Vincent it&#39;s a really good</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.770" end="00:34:35.210" style="s2">question it&#39;s a really difficult</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.910" end="00:34:37.400" style="s2">question the first thing you have to</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.210" end="00:34:39.800" style="s2">decide is this goes back to what I was</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.400" end="00:34:43.300" style="s2">discussing about 10 minutes ago about</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.800" end="00:34:46.040" style="s2">what your aims are you know your whole</p>

<p begin="00:34:46.040" end="00:34:51.980" style="s2">dependent on what you&#39;re on the aim of</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.650" end="00:34:55.160" style="s2">your ethical structure and so that</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.980" end="00:34:57.710" style="s2">ethical structure is is a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.160" end="00:35:00.680" style="s2">hierarchy with something at the top</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.710" end="00:35:02.480" style="s2">that&#39;s of crucial importance and Carl</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.680" end="00:35:05.200" style="s2">Jung would say that whatever is at the</p>

<p begin="00:35:05.200" end="00:35:10.250" style="s2">psychologically as if it&#39;s God for you</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.120" end="00:35:13.280" style="s2">it&#39;s because it&#39;s the highest of all</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.250" end="00:35:16.970" style="s2">possible values and you can think of God</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.280" end="00:35:19.010" style="s2">in that sense as a personality that</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.970" end="00:35:21.050" style="s2">perhaps a personality that you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.010" end="00:35:24.140" style="s2">to mimic because a value structure</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.050" end="00:35:27.230" style="s2">actually constitutes a personality that</p>

<p begin="00:35:36.260" end="00:35:40.040" style="s2">say well what do you</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.280" end="00:35:41.930" style="s2">want what do you want if you could have</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.040" end="00:35:44.630" style="s2">what you wanted if you could knock in</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.930" end="00:35:46.760" style="s2">the door would open so to speak and if</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.630" end="00:35:49.940" style="s2">you could ask and you would receive what</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.760" end="00:35:54.020" style="s2">would you want and and that means what</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.940" end="00:35:55.430" style="s2">would you give what would you give what</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.020" end="00:35:58.250" style="s2">would you be willing to give up</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.430" end="00:36:00.260" style="s2">important things for how would you</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.250" end="00:36:03.790" style="s2">prioritize which is the same as giving</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.260" end="00:36:06.140" style="s2">up important things and it&#39;s not easy to</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.790" end="00:36:08.060" style="s2">come to terms with what you want because</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.140" end="00:36:10.610" style="s2">you might be angry and resentful and</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.060" end="00:36:13.580" style="s2">bitter and you might have your reasons</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.610" end="00:36:16.130" style="s2">for that and and that might contaminate</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.580" end="00:36:18.830" style="s2">your ethical structure let&#39;s say and</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.130" end="00:36:20.510" style="s2">make it so that there&#39;s large parts of</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.830" end="00:36:22.100" style="s2">you that would be the shadow part from</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.510" end="00:36:25.400" style="s2">the Union perspectives who&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.100" end="00:36:30.080" style="s2">that are actually after conflict and and</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.400" end="00:36:32.120" style="s2">harm and cruelty and suffering out of</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.080" end="00:36:33.770" style="s2">spite and revenge and then the</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.120" end="00:36:35.990" style="s2">probability that part of you is like</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.770" end="00:36:38.270" style="s2">that is unbelievably high because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.990" end="00:36:40.700" style="s2">it&#39;s very hard to be pure of spirit</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.270" end="00:36:42.140" style="s2">let&#39;s say given how much suffering and</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.700" end="00:36:45.470" style="s2">malevolence there is in the world and</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.140" end="00:36:49.520" style="s2">how much were exposed to that so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.470" end="00:36:51.620" style="s2">very easy to take the low road if you if</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.520" end="00:36:53.690" style="s2">you are married let&#39;s say or you have a</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.620" end="00:36:55.910" style="s2">close relationship with someone and you</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.690" end="00:36:57.740" style="s2">want that relationship to be good then</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.910" end="00:37:02.510" style="s2">the first thing that you have to figure</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.740" end="00:37:05.540" style="s2">out is well what do you mean by good you</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.510" end="00:37:09.830" style="s2">know so and I would say well good would</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.540" end="00:37:13.070" style="s2">be loving let&#39;s say and what that would</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.830" end="00:37:15.170" style="s2">mean is that each of you would be trying</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.070" end="00:37:18.980" style="s2">to take care of the other and yourself</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.170" end="00:37:21.920" style="s2">as if you&#39;re of equal import and that</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.980" end="00:37:23.450" style="s2">that import is high and so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.920" end="00:37:26.090" style="s2">once you&#39;re married to someone for</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.450" end="00:37:27.800" style="s2">example or once you have children and</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.090" end="00:37:31.070" style="s2">then maybe this the same thing applies</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.800" end="00:37:34.100" style="s2">to your immediate family your parents</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.070" end="00:37:37.510" style="s2">and your siblings is that probably</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.100" end="00:37:40.190" style="s2">somewhat less so for them although still</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.510" end="00:37:44.270" style="s2">significantly that you have to treat</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.190" end="00:37:47.690" style="s2">your spouse and your children as if they</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.270" end="00:37:50.270" style="s2">are yourself and I know that&#39;s an old</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.690" end="00:37:51.680" style="s2">idea and it&#39;s not often explained well</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.270" end="00:37:56.130" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.680" end="00:37:57.509" style="s2">you you well that also assumes that what</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.130" end="00:37:59.609" style="s2">you want for yourself is something</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.509" end="00:38:01.049" style="s2">approximating what would be best for you</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.609" end="00:38:03.930" style="s2">and you&#39;d have to figure that out as</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.049" end="00:38:07.650" style="s2">well and I don&#39;t know it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.930" end="00:38:09.269" style="s2">that well you want to like the people</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.650" end="00:38:11.789" style="s2">that you&#39;re with and so you have to</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.269" end="00:38:13.980" style="s2">treat them well and you want them to</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.789" end="00:38:16.650" style="s2">love you and to love them</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.980" end="00:38:19.829" style="s2">I would say at least to the same degree</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.650" end="00:38:21.480" style="s2">that you&#39;d want that from a pet you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.829" end="00:38:23.309" style="s2">it&#39;s very nice to come home if you have</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.480" end="00:38:25.680" style="s2">a dog or another animal that loves you</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.309" end="00:38:27.509" style="s2">to have something there that&#39;s really on</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.680" end="00:38:29.190" style="s2">your side that&#39;s happy to see you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.509" end="00:38:31.650" style="s2">one of the wonderful things that can</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.190" end="00:38:33.690" style="s2">happen well in a marriage but also when</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.650" end="00:38:35.549" style="s2">you have children so you want to like</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.690" end="00:38:38.400" style="s2">the people you&#39;re around you want to</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.549" end="00:38:41.220" style="s2">love them you want to support them when</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.400" end="00:38:44.849" style="s2">they&#39;re having a hard time and vice</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.220" end="00:38:48.499" style="s2">versa so you want to make your the</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.849" end="00:38:52.109" style="s2">vessel in which your family&#39;s ensconced</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.499" end="00:38:54.890" style="s2">watertight and and capable of</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.109" end="00:38:56.970" style="s2">withstanding storms you want to</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.890" end="00:38:59.279" style="s2">discipline yourself so that you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.970" end="00:39:01.380" style="s2">doing things that you&#39;re ashamed of you</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.279" end="00:39:04.410" style="s2">want to tell the truth you want to work</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.380" end="00:39:06.210" style="s2">responsibly and be a good provider</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.410" end="00:39:08.579" style="s2">whether you&#39;re female or male in</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.210" end="00:39:10.619" style="s2">whatever capacity you can manage and I</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.579" end="00:39:12.029" style="s2">would say that also goes for children to</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.619" end="00:39:14.190" style="s2">the degree that they&#39;re capable of</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.029" end="00:39:16.619" style="s2">contributing to the family environment</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.190" end="00:39:19.079" style="s2">and you have to think that all through</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.619" end="00:39:21.630" style="s2">you want to embed your family in a</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.079" end="00:39:24.150" style="s2">healthy social life too and in a healthy</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.630" end="00:39:27.690" style="s2">community life but that all has to be</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.150" end="00:39:31.910" style="s2">conscious and thought through before you</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.690" end="00:39:31.910" style="s2">can start telling the truth</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.059" end="00:39:37.529" style="s2">know how to balance between making peace</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.940" end="00:39:38.309" style="s2">and speaking truth in intimate</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.529" end="00:39:40.140" style="s2">relationships</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.309" end="00:39:42.539" style="s2">what if truth hurts the other or two</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.140" end="00:39:44.069" style="s2">sides conflict okay so the first thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.539" end="00:39:46.170" style="s2">you have to do is with the person that</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.069" end="00:39:48.150" style="s2">you&#39;re communicating with you both have</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.170" end="00:39:51.089" style="s2">to figure out well what it is it what</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.150" end="00:39:54.989" style="s2">are you aiming at you know I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.089" end="00:39:56.279" style="s2">in rule 9 which is assume that the</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.989" end="00:39:57.869" style="s2">person you&#39;re listening to knows</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.279" end="00:40:00.480" style="s2">something that you don&#39;t that I outlined</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.869" end="00:40:02.670" style="s2">a number of different conversational</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.480" end="00:40:04.530" style="s2">types you know and there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.670" end="00:40:07.020" style="s2">conversational type that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.530" end="00:40:08.790" style="s2">designed to mutually amuse and that can</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.020" end="00:40:11.820" style="s2">be lots of fun and there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.790" end="00:40:14.220" style="s2">conversational type that&#39;s designed to</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.820" end="00:40:15.900" style="s2">win that&#39;s where I have a point of view</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.220" end="00:40:18.480" style="s2">and you have a point of view and and we</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.900" end="00:40:21.240" style="s2">engage in a power dispute especially</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.480" end="00:40:24.480" style="s2">essentially a Dominus dispute where the</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.240" end="00:40:28.020" style="s2">goal is for one of the positions to come</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.480" end="00:40:29.640" style="s2">out on top and win and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.020" end="00:40:34.590" style="s2">another conversation where the goal is</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.640" end="00:40:38.280" style="s2">to explore a problem and to come to a</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.590" end="00:40:41.040" style="s2">joint to jointly further the</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.280" end="00:40:43.950" style="s2">understanding of that problem and I</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.040" end="00:40:46.140" style="s2">would say that that&#39;s how you balance</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.950" end="00:40:48.780" style="s2">making peace and speaking the truth in</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.140" end="00:40:50.970" style="s2">intimate relationships is that you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.780" end="00:40:53.790" style="s2">the first thing you have to do is well</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.970" end="00:40:56.100" style="s2">you have to have a conversation about</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.790" end="00:40:58.740" style="s2">just exactly what the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.100" end="00:41:01.560" style="s2">and that might take a long time and a</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.740" end="00:41:04.080" style="s2">lot of listening because when people are</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.560" end="00:41:06.300" style="s2">upset about something they don&#39;t always</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.080" end="00:41:08.730" style="s2">know what it is that they&#39;re upset about</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.300" end="00:41:10.170" style="s2">and what they&#39;re upset about might be</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.730" end="00:41:11.700" style="s2">associated with a hundred other things</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.170" end="00:41:13.620" style="s2">that they&#39;re upset about that they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.700" end="00:41:15.300" style="s2">not dealt with and some of those can be</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.620" end="00:41:18.090" style="s2">directly germane to the issue at hand</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.300" end="00:41:22.470" style="s2">but some of them can be a consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.090" end="00:41:25.260" style="s2">Oh old family trouble or old trauma to</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.470" end="00:41:26.790" style="s2">use a very overused word but trouble in</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.260" end="00:41:29.550" style="s2">the past that hasn&#39;t been dealt with</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.790" end="00:41:31.920" style="s2">properly and it all amalgamates into a</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.550" end="00:41:35.220" style="s2">complex that&#39;s the psychoanalytic idea</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.920" end="00:41:37.740" style="s2">that consists of all the problems that</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.220" end="00:41:40.170" style="s2">the person is dealing with that haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.740" end="00:41:45.240" style="s2">been resolved and then any new problem</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.170" end="00:41:48.030" style="s2">gets it gets it&#39;s poorly separated from</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.240" end="00:41:50.610" style="s2">that entire complex of problems and so</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.030" end="00:41:52.440" style="s2">when the person is upset then all the</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.610" end="00:41:56.250" style="s2">things they&#39;re upset about can sort of</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.440" end="00:41:58.620" style="s2">manifest themselves in in a incoherent</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.250" end="00:42:01.260" style="s2">and chaotic manner and that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.620" end="00:42:04.080" style="s2">hard and so if someone&#39;s upset about</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.260" end="00:42:06.000" style="s2">something you or the other person might</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.080" end="00:42:08.640" style="s2">take a tremendous amount of listening</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.000" end="00:42:12.780" style="s2">before you can even get to what the</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.640" end="00:42:14.700" style="s2">problem is and often during that process</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.780" end="00:42:17.010" style="s2">of listening there&#39;s a lot of mutual</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.700" end="00:42:18.210" style="s2">recrimination and accusations as each</p>

<p begin="00:42:38.550" end="00:42:43.620" style="s2">a lot and then that person has to defend</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.890" end="00:42:45.960" style="s2">themselves like mad just so that they</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.620" end="00:42:47.820" style="s2">can not be the target of all that</p>

<p begin="00:42:47.820" end="00:42:54.300" style="s2">tremendous length of time so anyways you</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.260" end="00:42:58.890" style="s2">have to listen to each other a lot it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.300" end="00:43:00.810" style="s2">like okay what&#39;s the problem and then a</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.890" end="00:43:03.150" style="s2">rule there might be well what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.810" end="00:43:05.220" style="s2">minimum problem it&#39;s like while our</p>

<p begin="00:43:05.220" end="00:43:11.250" style="s2">a non-starter for a discussion man</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.570" end="00:43:14.520" style="s2">because you can&#39;t fix your whole</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.250" end="00:43:17.370" style="s2">relationship you have to be more precise</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.520" end="00:43:19.050" style="s2">you have to think and maybe your partner</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.370" end="00:43:22.860" style="s2">has to help you figure out what it is</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.050" end="00:43:25.860" style="s2">that you&#39;re upset about right now that</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.860" end="00:43:28.140" style="s2">could be rectified I mean maybe you made</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.860" end="00:43:31.980" style="s2">a nice dinner or even a dinner that</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.140" end="00:43:34.140" style="s2">wasn&#39;t so nice and you got treated</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.980" end="00:43:36.480" style="s2">casually and with a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.140" end="00:43:37.950" style="s2">contempt well everyone was eating it you</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.480" end="00:43:40.530" style="s2">know they came in and grabbed the food</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.950" end="00:43:42.810" style="s2">scattered to the four ends of the house</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.530" end="00:43:44.670" style="s2">and ate it and didn&#39;t bring their dishes</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.810" end="00:43:46.320" style="s2">back and didn&#39;t say thank you and you</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.670" end="00:43:49.350" style="s2">know you&#39;re very irritated about that</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.320" end="00:43:51.060" style="s2">and you have your reasons and you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.350" end="00:43:53.400" style="s2">the way you might respond to that is</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.060" end="00:43:56.150" style="s2">well this relationship isn&#39;t working but</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.400" end="00:43:59.700" style="s2">it&#39;s not precise enough you think well I</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.150" end="00:44:01.800" style="s2">have this specific problem I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.700" end="00:44:03.240" style="s2">make it a specific problem then I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.800" end="00:44:06.110" style="s2">trying to come up with a specific</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.240" end="00:44:08.160" style="s2">solution that might make this</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.110" end="00:44:13.200" style="s2">relationship this part of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.160" end="00:44:15.540" style="s2">relationship work better and so look you</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.200" end="00:44:18.060" style="s2">have to aim at peace and you have to aim</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.540" end="00:44:22.860" style="s2">at love and responsibility and mutual</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.060" end="00:44:24.300" style="s2">support you have to want that for the</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.860" end="00:44:27.630" style="s2">people that are important to you in your</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.300" end="00:44:29.820" style="s2">life and then you can start to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.630" end="00:44:31.480" style="s2">them because you&#39;re gonna listen in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.820" end="00:44:33.640" style="s2">proper way you&#39;re gonna listen</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.480" end="00:44:38.859" style="s2">in a way that&#39;s aiming at that higher</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.640" end="00:44:42.490" style="s2">good which is mutual peace amongst the</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.859" end="00:44:44.530" style="s2">members of the community something that</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.490" end="00:44:47.170" style="s2">I learned for example from Jean Piaget</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.530" end="00:44:49.330" style="s2">he called that an equilibrated state and</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.170" end="00:44:52.000" style="s2">the collaborated state is like a game</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.330" end="00:44:54.550" style="s2">that everyone wants to play and so if</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.000" end="00:44:56.530" style="s2">you set your household up properly then</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.550" end="00:44:58.840" style="s2">it&#39;s a game that everybody is</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.530" end="00:45:00.670" style="s2">participating in voluntarily and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.840" end="00:45:02.800" style="s2">going to be predicated on the desire for</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.670" end="00:45:05.200" style="s2">peace and the willingness to speak truth</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.800" end="00:45:07.119" style="s2">and the ability to take responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.200" end="00:45:09.580" style="s2">so that has to be part of your higher</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.119" end="00:45:11.230" style="s2">order more lame and then when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.580" end="00:45:15.840" style="s2">having a difficult discussion with</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.230" end="00:45:19.150" style="s2">someone the discussion is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.840" end="00:45:21.340" style="s2">affected by that higher-order moral aim</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.150" end="00:45:23.890" style="s2">it&#39;s not going to be contaminated to the</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.340" end="00:45:27.040" style="s2">same degree by your desire to inflict</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.890" end="00:45:29.200" style="s2">pain and attain victory and you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.040" end="00:45:33.040" style="s2">crush your opponent and punish them for</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.200" end="00:45:34.780" style="s2">their previous sins and indicate your</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.040" end="00:45:39.490" style="s2">disappointment things they&#39;ve done over</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.780" end="00:45:41.530" style="s2">the years and all of that and so you can</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.490" end="00:45:44.380" style="s2">tell if you&#39;ve got it balanced by the</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.530" end="00:45:48.850" style="s2">way Vincent if the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.380" end="00:45:50.560" style="s2">continues you know when when we used to</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.850" end="00:45:53.680" style="s2">sit down for family meetings which</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.560" end="00:45:55.090" style="s2">happened on a bi-monthly basis something</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.680" end="00:45:58.800" style="s2">like that once every two months</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.090" end="00:46:02.800" style="s2">when we return to Davitt divide up</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.800" end="00:46:05.619" style="s2">economic and practical duties amongst my</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.800" end="00:46:08.440" style="s2">wife and up and I and the kids we had</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.619" end="00:46:09.850" style="s2">some rules and the rules were well you</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.440" end="00:46:11.440" style="s2">know there&#39;s a certain number of things</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.850" end="00:46:14.470" style="s2">that have to be done in the house to</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.440" end="00:46:16.600" style="s2">keep it running in a manner that anyone</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.470" end="00:46:18.760" style="s2">with any sense would want it to run and</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.600" end="00:46:22.210" style="s2">there are certain responsibilities that</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.760" end="00:46:25.030" style="s2">everyone has to undertake to facilitate</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.210" end="00:46:27.850" style="s2">that and there&#39;s difficult discussions</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.030" end="00:46:32.170" style="s2">that have to be had about who&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.850" end="00:46:33.940" style="s2">do what and so here&#39;s the rules we have</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.170" end="00:46:36.520" style="s2">to make a list of what needs to be done</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.940" end="00:46:40.359" style="s2">we have to agree on that and then we</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.520" end="00:46:42.790" style="s2">have to each accept the responsibilities</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.359" end="00:46:43.270" style="s2">that go along with that in some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.790" end="00:46:45.160" style="s2">order</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.270" end="00:46:46.869" style="s2">maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.160" end="00:46:48.640" style="s2">choose one and then I choose one and</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.869" end="00:46:51.160" style="s2">then someone else chooses one assuming</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.640" end="00:46:54.609" style="s2">that everybody&#39;s mature enough and</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.160" end="00:46:59.680" style="s2">capable of doing the jobs that they pick</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.609" end="00:47:01.630" style="s2">and that you have to negotiate until you</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.680" end="00:47:03.730" style="s2">come to the best solution that can be</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.630" end="00:47:05.349" style="s2">negotiated which isn&#39;t necessarily a</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.730" end="00:47:07.089" style="s2">perfect solution but it might be the</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.349" end="00:47:08.920" style="s2">best one that can be done and then you</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.089" end="00:47:11.920" style="s2">have to stick with it until the next</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.920" end="00:47:14.559" style="s2">negotiation and if you get upset during</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.920" end="00:47:17.380" style="s2">the negotiations which you likely will</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.559" end="00:47:19.270" style="s2">because these are difficult topics how</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.380" end="00:47:20.829" style="s2">to divide up responsibilities in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.270" end="00:47:22.510" style="s2">house and people get mad because they</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.829" end="00:47:24.970" style="s2">feel they&#39;ve been taken advantage of her</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.510" end="00:47:26.980" style="s2">are being listened to one of the rules</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.970" end="00:47:29.530" style="s2">was well you can leave the discussion</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.980" end="00:47:31.210" style="s2">but only until you calm down and then</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.530" end="00:47:34.569" style="s2">you have to come back because these</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.210" end="00:47:36.280" style="s2">things have to be pushed through they</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.569" end="00:47:38.589" style="s2">have to be negotiated through because</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.280" end="00:47:41.670" style="s2">the alternative is well important things</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.589" end="00:47:43.809" style="s2">don&#39;t get done or people do them</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.670" end="00:47:46.059" style="s2">resentfully because they&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.809" end="00:47:50.559" style="s2">forced by their own orderliness or their</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.059" end="00:47:52.930" style="s2">own conscientiousness or or but we know</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.559" end="00:47:54.369" style="s2">by force psychological or otherwise on</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.930" end="00:47:57.130" style="s2">the part of other people these things</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.369" end="00:47:59.289" style="s2">have to be negotiated through you can</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.130" end="00:48:01.089" style="s2">tell if you&#39;ve got the balance between</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.289" end="00:48:03.640" style="s2">making peace and speaking the truth</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.089" end="00:48:06.250" style="s2">right if the conversation continues and</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.640" end="00:48:08.470" style="s2">it can be emotional and will be and can</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.250" end="00:48:11.140" style="s2">be difficult because important things</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.470" end="00:48:13.299" style="s2">have to be dealt with but as long as the</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.140" end="00:48:15.849" style="s2">people are still in that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.299" end="00:48:17.589" style="s2">and communicating then you then you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.849" end="00:48:20.079" style="s2">got the balance right you know and you</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.589" end="00:48:23.289" style="s2">might have to take a break maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.079" end="00:48:25.349" style="s2">have to hold off till the next day maybe</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.289" end="00:48:27.609" style="s2">sometimes when you&#39;re negotiating</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.349" end="00:48:30.099" style="s2">something that&#39;s difficult you have to</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.609" end="00:48:32.799" style="s2">offer the other person the opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.099" end="00:48:35.109" style="s2">to sleep on their decision - which i</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.799" end="00:48:36.520" style="s2">think is often a very good idea if you</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.109" end="00:48:39.099" style="s2">have to make an important decision in</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.520" end="00:48:40.869" style="s2">your life it&#39;s very useful to tell the</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.099" end="00:48:42.789" style="s2">person that you&#39;re negotiating with it</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.869" end="00:48:45.220" style="s2">look I&#39;m interested in this and it seems</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.789" end="00:48:48.460" style="s2">good but I&#39;m not gonna agree until I</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.220" end="00:48:49.839" style="s2">sleep on it gives you well lots of</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.460" end="00:48:52.240" style="s2">things happen when you sleep you</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.839" end="00:48:53.589" style="s2">organize your brain when you sleep at</p>

<p begin="00:48:53.589" end="00:48:58.779" style="s2">organize it and you can often be more</p>

<p begin="00:49:24.849" end="00:49:28.989" style="s2">down cuz I don&#39;t know the specifics of</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.739" end="00:49:31.390" style="s2">your situation and you sound like an</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.989" end="00:49:34.509" style="s2">extroverted person and extroverted</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.390" end="00:49:38.049" style="s2">people like to be in the center of a</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.509" end="00:49:39.729" style="s2">large group of people and you know they</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.049" end="00:49:42.069" style="s2">like parties and they like to tell jokes</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.729" end="00:49:43.989" style="s2">and they&#39;re energized by social</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.069" end="00:49:48.699" style="s2">interactions and so they can have a</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.989" end="00:49:50.919" style="s2">fairly large group of friends that where</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.699" end="00:49:55.859" style="s2">their attention is spread across many</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.919" end="00:49:59.259" style="s2">people now and you know that can perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.859" end="00:50:01.719" style="s2">be a contour or one of the consequences</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.259" end="00:50:03.390" style="s2">of that can be this feeling that you</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.719" end="00:50:06.489" style="s2">have that the friendships are shallow</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.390" end="00:50:08.469" style="s2">because there&#39;s not much to them the</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.489" end="00:50:10.559" style="s2">first question might be well you know do</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.469" end="00:50:17.289" style="s2">you have an intimate relationship</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.559" end="00:50:19.659" style="s2">because a fair bit of depth of human</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.289" end="00:50:21.519" style="s2">interaction comes as a consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.659" end="00:50:23.199" style="s2">long-term committed relationships right</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.519" end="00:50:24.699" style="s2">with your wife or your husband or your</p>

<p begin="00:50:24.699" end="00:50:30.519" style="s2">children and so I would say the true</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.999" end="00:50:33.009" style="s2">depth in relationship is generally to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.519" end="00:50:35.349" style="s2">found within family that doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.009" end="00:50:38.409" style="s2">that friends aren&#39;t important and the</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.349" end="00:50:40.089" style="s2">next issue is well are there things that</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.409" end="00:50:43.209" style="s2">you&#39;re doing with your friends are there</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.089" end="00:50:46.239" style="s2">activities that you&#39;re undertaking with</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.209" end="00:50:49.929" style="s2">your friends that are more significant</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.239" end="00:50:52.599" style="s2">than mere casual amusement you know or</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.929" end="00:50:55.209" style="s2">is it it&#39;s just casual amusement because</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.599" end="00:50:59.289" style="s2">if it is you know the bar scene or or</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.209" end="00:51:02.229" style="s2">that kind of party</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.289" end="00:51:05.259" style="s2">life let&#39;s say the friendships aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.229" end="00:51:09.539" style="s2">going to be very deep because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.259" end="00:51:11.440" style="s2">not they&#39;re predicated on shallow</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.539" end="00:51:14.950" style="s2">activities and</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.440" end="00:51:18.730" style="s2">maybe that you need to find some</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.950" end="00:51:21.069" style="s2">activities that you feel are profound on</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.730" end="00:51:23.470" style="s2">your own and find people that you can</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.069" end="00:51:26.319" style="s2">share them with because a fair bit of</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.470" end="00:51:29.380" style="s2">friendship is in fact the engagement in</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.319" end="00:51:32.140" style="s2">shared activity and so the more profound</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.380" end="00:51:34.980" style="s2">the activity at least in principle then</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.140" end="00:51:39.490" style="s2">perhaps the more profound the friendship</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.980" end="00:51:42.240" style="s2">certainly the people whose friendships I</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.490" end="00:51:48.789" style="s2">would regard as most crucial to me are</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.240" end="00:51:54.190" style="s2">people with whom I&#39;m involved in complex</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.789" end="00:51:55.809" style="s2">and difficult in endeavors as well as</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.190" end="00:51:58.660" style="s2">friendships there are things that we are</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.809" end="00:52:02.319" style="s2">doing together that we both regardless</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.660" end="00:52:04.599" style="s2">of crucial importance and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.319" end="00:52:06.309" style="s2">necessary because I think that a fair</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.599" end="00:52:08.740" style="s2">bit of friendship apart from you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.309" end="00:52:11.980" style="s2">the part that&#39;s amusement and fun which</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.740" end="00:52:14.799" style="s2">is important is a consequence of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.980" end="00:52:16.299" style="s2">profundity of shared activities and so</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.799" end="00:52:18.579" style="s2">you might want to ask yourself you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.299" end="00:52:23.109" style="s2">are you doing anything with anyone that</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.579" end="00:52:24.910" style="s2">you regard is important and and then the</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.109" end="00:52:27.130" style="s2">other thing I would ask is well you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.910" end="00:52:29.589" style="s2">do you have an assortment of intimate</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.130" end="00:52:32.230" style="s2">relationships do you have a partner a</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.589" end="00:52:35.170" style="s2">wife or a husband do you have children I</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.230" end="00:52:37.900" style="s2">don&#39;t know how old you are because and</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.170" end="00:52:41.380" style="s2">are you spending enough time attending</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.900" end="00:52:44.079" style="s2">to your parents and your siblings to</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.380" end="00:52:46.089" style="s2">keep those relationships alive with</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.079" end="00:52:50.279" style="s2">holidays and with visits and that sort</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.089" end="00:52:52.150" style="s2">of thing that&#39;s where you find that</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.279" end="00:52:54.880" style="s2">relationships that generally speaking</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.150" end="00:52:56.440" style="s2">are deep and meaningful and lasting even</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.880" end="00:53:02.020" style="s2">though they&#39;re often the ones that are</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.440" end="00:53:05.200" style="s2">also the most problematic Disney has</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.020" end="00:53:07.510" style="s2">taken a direction towards promoting SJW</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.200" end="00:53:10.089" style="s2">agendas yes well you can say that again</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.510" end="00:53:12.069" style="s2">this has been reflected despite backlash</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.089" end="00:53:15.069" style="s2">in the Marvel and Star Wars movies</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.069" end="00:53:16.779" style="s2">thoughts my sense is that self-limiting</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.069" end="00:53:18.520" style="s2">I mean I know that one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.779" end="00:53:20.980" style="s2">that&#39;s I know some people in the comics</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.520" end="00:53:24.670" style="s2">industry comic-book industry and I know</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.980" end="00:53:26.799" style="s2">that the</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.670" end="00:53:30.549" style="s2">superhero types that have been put</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.799" end="00:53:32.890" style="s2">forward to manifest a diversity agenda</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.549" end="00:53:35.260" style="s2">have generally been colossal failures</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.890" end="00:53:39.190" style="s2">and that tends to be the case at the box</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.260" end="00:53:41.260" style="s2">office as well and so look here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.190" end="00:53:45.309" style="s2">something that I think is universally</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.260" end="00:53:48.700" style="s2">true as soon as you subvert art and I</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.309" end="00:53:51.400" style="s2">would regard movies as art they&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.700" end="00:53:53.079" style="s2">form of literature and they can be a</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.400" end="00:53:55.299" style="s2">very profound form of literature but</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.079" end="00:53:58.240" style="s2">even if they&#39;re not even if they&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.299" end="00:54:04.119" style="s2">know like an well paced and well-written</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.240" end="00:54:08.140" style="s2">action thriller if the story which is</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.119" end="00:54:10.720" style="s2">the art in the movie part of the art in</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.140" end="00:54:13.750" style="s2">the movie if the story is subverted to a</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.720" end="00:54:15.609" style="s2">political agenda then it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.750" end="00:54:18.280" style="s2">punished for that at the box-office</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.609" end="00:54:19.869" style="s2">because no one except for the odd</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.280" end="00:54:21.670" style="s2">acolyte is going to be the least bit</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.869" end="00:54:23.980" style="s2">happy with that and even they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.670" end="00:54:25.599" style="s2">they&#39;ll they&#39;ll mouth their approval but</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.980" end="00:54:27.819" style="s2">they won&#39;t to watch the movies because</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.599" end="00:54:29.500" style="s2">they just hear what they they already</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.819" end="00:54:33.160" style="s2">know there&#39;s no mystery there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.500" end="00:54:35.109" style="s2">investigation in a good story the</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.160" end="00:54:37.270" style="s2">storyteller should be trying to figure</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.109" end="00:54:39.790" style="s2">out the story as he or she writes and</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.270" end="00:54:43.150" style="s2">the audience should be participating in</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.790" end="00:54:46.210" style="s2">that process the the moral of the story</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.150" end="00:54:47.770" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be stamped on the story right</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.210" end="00:54:53.349" style="s2">from the beginning because what you have</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.770" end="00:54:56.859" style="s2">then is not art you have propaganda and</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.349" end="00:54:58.960" style="s2">when people are out to see a movie or to</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.859" end="00:55:03.760" style="s2">watch something on television that that</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.960" end="00:55:07.630" style="s2">has an artistic a fundamental artistic</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.760" end="00:55:09.220" style="s2">nature if it&#39;s subverted to propaganda</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.630" end="00:55:14.470" style="s2">then it&#39;s going to fail</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.220" end="00:55:18.910" style="s2">and thank God for that so that&#39;s I think</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.470" end="00:55:20.920" style="s2">it&#39;s self-defeating we&#39;ll see there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.910" end="00:55:23.559" style="s2">nothing that beats a good story you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.920" end="00:55:29.470" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s no propaganda that can</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.559" end="00:55:32.579" style="s2">compete with a good story so I think</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.470" end="00:55:32.579" style="s2">it&#39;ll burn itself out</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.690" end="00:55:43.110" style="s2">oh here&#39;s a simple one what is the soul</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.420" end="00:55:43.110" style="s2">to you</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.140" end="00:56:14.910" style="s2">that&#39;s a hard question I would say like</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.990" end="00:56:18.420" style="s2">theologically a soul is that aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.910" end="00:56:20.970" style="s2">the human that aspect of human being</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.420" end="00:56:27.240" style="s2">that&#39;s akin to divinity that&#39;s made in</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.970" end="00:56:30.150" style="s2">the image of God and so and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.240" end="00:56:32.700" style="s2">that&#39;s a very very important concept I</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.150" end="00:56:34.500" style="s2">don&#39;t think a society can survive I</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.700" end="00:56:37.800" style="s2">don&#39;t think that you can survive a</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.500" end="00:56:39.270" style="s2">relationship with yourself I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.800" end="00:56:42.030" style="s2">you can have a relationship with another</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.270" end="00:56:44.940" style="s2">person and I don&#39;t think a society can</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.030" end="00:56:49.110" style="s2">organize itself in a productive and</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.940" end="00:56:53.280" style="s2">sustainable and peaceful manner without</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.110" end="00:56:56.750" style="s2">that idea as the core idea and so the</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.280" end="00:57:00.090" style="s2">core idea is that there&#39;s something of</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.750" end="00:57:05.970" style="s2">irreducible value that characterizes</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.090" end="00:57:08.550" style="s2">each human being and that it&#39;s of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.970" end="00:57:12.410" style="s2">highest value which is what makes it say</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.550" end="00:57:17.700" style="s2">akin to God or akin to divinity and so</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.410" end="00:57:20.400" style="s2">that&#39;s the soul and then the question is</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.700" end="00:57:23.760" style="s2">maybe how does that manifest itself in</p>

<p begin="00:57:27.300" end="00:57:34.010" style="s2">very tightly associated with what modern</p>

<p begin="01:00:10.200" end="01:00:14.940" style="s2">transforms it into the being of the</p>

<p begin="01:00:42.550" end="01:00:48.250" style="s2">choices something akin to what people</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.480" end="01:00:52.960" style="s2">more classically have referred to as</p>

<p begin="01:00:52.960" end="01:01:00.130" style="s2">really about the metaphysics of the soul</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.410" end="01:01:02.170" style="s2">except that it&#39;s very mysterious that we</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.130" end="01:01:08.170" style="s2">have this capacity for consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.170" end="01:01:10.720" style="s2">which is completely I would say beyond</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.170" end="01:01:13.180" style="s2">our current understanding we have no</p>

<p begin="01:01:16.110" end="01:01:21.070" style="s2">to deny the very existence of something</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.210" end="01:01:22.690" style="s2">like consciousness and freewill and the</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.070" end="01:01:25.150" style="s2">problem I have with those arguments is</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.690" end="01:01:26.980" style="s2">that well the first thing is that you</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.150" end="01:01:29.350" style="s2">don&#39;t look deterministic until you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.980" end="01:01:31.090" style="s2">built habits sets and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.350" end="01:01:33.490" style="s2">consequence of consciousness because</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.090" end="01:01:35.200" style="s2">consciousness builds habit sets and the</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.490" end="01:01:37.930" style="s2">second is that it doesn&#39;t seem to be</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.200" end="01:01:40.750" style="s2">possible to organize a relationship with</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.930" end="01:01:43.900" style="s2">yourself or an intimate partner or a</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.750" end="01:01:46.030" style="s2">family or a community without the</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.900" end="01:01:48.970" style="s2">concept of the divine value of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.030" end="01:01:52.720" style="s2">individual and the capacity of that</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.970" end="01:01:55.360" style="s2">divine spark let&#39;s say to manifest</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.720" end="01:01:56.650" style="s2">itself in free will I don&#39;t see how</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.360" end="01:01:59.050" style="s2">societies can organize themselves</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.650" end="01:02:00.580" style="s2">without those principles and to me that</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.050" end="01:02:03.120" style="s2">indicates that there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.580" end="01:02:06.250" style="s2">them that&#39;s profoundly true now you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.120" end="01:02:08.500" style="s2">we all have our definitions of what</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.250" end="01:02:11.380" style="s2">constitutes sufficient proof for truth</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.500" end="01:02:16.360" style="s2">but I think that&#39;s powerful those are</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.380" end="01:02:18.580" style="s2">those are two powerful arguments so the</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.360" end="01:02:21.130" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to say what the sole means</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.580" end="01:02:23.620" style="s2">metaphysically because you know say</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.130" end="01:02:26.860" style="s2">beyond the console on the confines of a</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.620" end="01:02:29.470" style="s2">single human being we do have this sense</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.860" end="01:02:32.320" style="s2">that the soul can expand itself into</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.470" end="01:02:34.240" style="s2">something that&#39;s greater than well</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.320" end="01:02:37.210" style="s2">greater than it has been it has this</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.240" end="01:02:40.390" style="s2">capacity for growth and we do have the</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.210" end="01:02:41.030" style="s2">sense that the soul can expand itself to</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.390" end="01:02:44.690" style="s2">the point where</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.030" end="01:02:48.680" style="s2">it it&#39;s enlightened for lack of a better</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.690" end="01:02:52.510" style="s2">word that it&#39;s working as efficiently as</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.680" end="01:02:54.890" style="s2">possible to transform everything that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.510" end="01:02:57.530" style="s2">unnecessarily painful and malevolent</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.890" end="01:03:00.650" style="s2">about the world into what&#39;s positive and</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.530" end="01:03:02.300" style="s2">good and and and that it does that as a</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.650" end="01:03:04.550" style="s2">consequence of confronting the world</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.300" end="01:03:07.010" style="s2">with courage and truth and I think</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.550" end="01:03:09.560" style="s2">that&#39;s right and I do think that that</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.010" end="01:03:12.350" style="s2">means that the soul participates in</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.560" end="01:03:16.600" style="s2">something eternal which is the attempt</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.350" end="01:03:19.130" style="s2">of being itself to transform what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.600" end="01:03:21.530" style="s2">unnecessarily painful and malevolent</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.130" end="01:03:23.420" style="s2">into what&#39;s good and that human beings</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.530" end="01:03:25.790" style="s2">actually do participate in that and that</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.420" end="01:03:29.360" style="s2">that&#39;s part of the reason that our</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.790" end="01:03:33.080" style="s2">ancient tradition insists that were made</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.360" end="01:03:35.870" style="s2">in the image of God and I think that</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.080" end="01:03:38.570" style="s2">it&#39;s a mistake to underestimate the</p>

<p begin="01:07:30.230" end="01:07:34.280" style="s2">straightforward I mean Nietzsche&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.390" end="01:07:36.500" style="s2">Beyond Good and Evil is a difficult book</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.280" end="01:07:40.180" style="s2">but it&#39;s easier than those the two I</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.500" end="01:07:43.280" style="s2">just mentioned start a discussion group</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.180" end="01:07:47.540" style="s2">start a book group that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="01:08:10.760" end="01:08:16.299" style="s2">so that it&#39;s predicated on truth and</p>

<p begin="01:08:24.920" end="01:08:28.969" style="s2">to your organization I mean I&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.600" end="01:08:30.890" style="s2">people now go into large-scale</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.969" end="01:08:35.170" style="s2">organizations that were collapsing quite</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.890" end="01:08:39.670" style="s2">badly under the weight of accumulated</p>

<p begin="01:08:44.750" end="01:08:48.799" style="s2">everyone in the organization these are</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.819" end="01:08:50.569" style="s2">large-scale organizations to listen to</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.799" end="01:08:52.250" style="s2">everyone in the organization to say look</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.569" end="01:08:54.410" style="s2">I&#39;m here to find out what the problems</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.250" end="01:08:57.319" style="s2">are you can actually tell me like a real</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.410" end="01:08:59.960" style="s2">high alpha male like you know real</p>

<p begin="01:09:05.630" end="01:09:08.390" style="s2">reason I don&#39;t want it sugar-coated is</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.100" end="01:09:09.980" style="s2">because I want to know what the problems</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.390" end="01:09:12.440" style="s2">are and the reason that I want to know</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.980" end="01:09:14.839" style="s2">is because I think that if we face them</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.440" end="01:09:18.200" style="s2">we could fix them and that that would be</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.839" end="01:09:20.870" style="s2">better for everyone and then to start to</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.200" end="01:09:22.400" style="s2">gather information about what it is in</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.870" end="01:09:24.980" style="s2">the instance</p>

<p begin="01:09:27.470" end="01:09:33.560" style="s2">and that works and like the evidence for</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.430" end="01:09:38.120" style="s2">this I think is solid that it works</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.560" end="01:09:39.710" style="s2">there&#39;s good evidence that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.120" end="01:09:41.450" style="s2">good book for example called the wealth</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.710" end="01:09:43.730" style="s2">and poverty of Nations written by a</p>

<p begin="01:09:46.400" end="01:09:53.120" style="s2">about the unbelievably high economic</p>

<p begin="01:10:04.400" end="01:10:08.750" style="s2">agreeableness or compassion which is the</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.980" end="01:10:10.550" style="s2">only virtue that seems to matter at the</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.750" end="01:10:12.860" style="s2">moment even though its status as a</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.550" end="01:10:15.680" style="s2">virtue is highly debatable in my</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.860" end="01:10:18.380" style="s2">estimation because compassion has to be</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.680" end="01:10:21.530" style="s2">temp tempered with judgment</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.380" end="01:10:23.150" style="s2">otherwise it&#39;s devouring uh-huh but</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.530" end="01:10:25.220" style="s2">conscientiousness is an excellent</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.150" end="01:10:27.170" style="s2">predictor of long-term success for</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.220" end="01:10:29.750" style="s2">individuals and conscientious people are</p>

<p begin="01:10:29.750" end="01:10:35.240" style="s2">and orderly you know that can be a</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.270" end="01:10:37.820" style="s2">problem because it it can lead to a kind</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.240" end="01:10:40.940" style="s2">of rigidity so it&#39;s not the only virtue</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.820" end="01:10:45.110" style="s2">that&#39;s necessary but it does seem to be</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.940" end="01:10:48.260" style="s2">the case that honesty is a productive</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.110" end="01:10:50.990" style="s2">policy and I would also say that if you</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.260" end="01:10:53.360" style="s2">look around the world the cultures that</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.990" end="01:10:55.850" style="s2">are the most corrupt are the cultures</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.360" end="01:10:57.500" style="s2">that are the most poor and you could say</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.850" end="01:10:59.480" style="s2">well the reason that they&#39;re corrupt is</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.500" end="01:11:01.190" style="s2">because they&#39;re poor but I don&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.480" end="01:11:04.130" style="s2">that because then you&#39;d have to also</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.190" end="01:11:06.710" style="s2">agree that if you&#39;re poor you&#39;re corrupt</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.130" end="01:11:09.140" style="s2">and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.710" end="01:11:12.350" style="s2">I think the corruption drives the</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.140" end="01:11:16.940" style="s2">poverty now there&#39;s no doubt somewhat of</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.350" end="01:11:18.830" style="s2">a feedback loop there but you get rid of</p>

<p begin="01:11:18.830" end="01:11:23.210" style="s2">my sense and like like I said you can</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.710" end="01:11:26.030" style="s2">make the opposite argument if you want</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.210" end="01:11:28.700" style="s2">while poverty causes corruption well</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.030" end="01:11:31.160" style="s2">really so your claim is that the poor</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.700" end="01:11:34.040" style="s2">are more corrupt because they&#39;re poor</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.160" end="01:11:35.900" style="s2">that&#39;s your fundamental claim and that</p>

<p begin="01:11:51.260" end="01:11:54.830" style="s2">materially I don&#39;t believe that there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:15:31.370" end="01:15:36.080" style="s2">was the Pew Research Foundation that</p>

<p begin="01:15:41.120" end="01:15:47.840" style="s2">important and I believe it was 76% of</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.770" end="01:15:52.490" style="s2">respondents indicated that it was family</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.840" end="01:15:55.490" style="s2">and family is more important than career</p>

<p begin="01:21:36.190" end="01:21:40.690" style="s2">feminist I guess probably what I would</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.560" end="01:21:43.720" style="s2">recommend there is just stop saying that</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.690" end="01:21:47.200" style="s2">all it sounds to me like is that it gets</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.720" end="01:21:48.790" style="s2">you in trouble I mean I think what you</p>

<p begin="01:21:48.790" end="01:21:55.810" style="s2">question is that because you have some</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.900" end="01:21:57.730" style="s2">traditional ideas about family it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.810" end="01:22:00.430" style="s2">difficult for you to reconcile that with</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.730" end="01:22:02.250" style="s2">the rhetoric of modern feminism and</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.430" end="01:22:05.950" style="s2">that&#39;s perfectly understandable because</p>

<p begin="01:22:05.950" end="01:22:10.960" style="s2">seem to be particularly antipathetic</p>

<p begin="01:22:10.960" end="01:22:14.350" style="s2">quite remarkable achievement given that</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.060" end="01:22:19.380" style="s2">they&#39;re supposed to be on the side of</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.350" end="01:22:23.620" style="s2">women but I would say if you want kids</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.380" end="01:22:26.890" style="s2">you talk to people who are positively</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.620" end="01:22:31.120" style="s2">inclined to your motivation and ambition</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.890" end="01:22:33.640" style="s2">and you don&#39;t discuss it with people who</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.120" end="01:22:36.700" style="s2">are inclined to put you down and</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.640" end="01:22:39.100" style="s2">denigrate that because they&#39;re deceiving</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.700" end="01:22:41.620" style="s2">themselves they&#39;re acting cruelly and</p>

<p begin="01:22:49.090" end="01:22:56.240" style="s2">desire and more power to you as far as</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.510" end="01:22:57.770" style="s2">I&#39;m concerned so it&#39;s a very courageous</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.240" end="01:23:00.320" style="s2">thing to bring a child into the world</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.770" end="01:23:02.510" style="s2">you know and then it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.320" end="01:23:07.460" style="s2">responsible thing to do it properly and</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.510" end="01:23:08.990" style="s2">you can&#39;t grow up you won&#39;t grow up and</p>

<p begin="01:23:08.990" end="01:23:18.170" style="s2">until you do that and you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.430" end="01:23:22.280" style="s2">certainly possible too that the people</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.170" end="01:23:23.960" style="s2">that are attacking you are even</p>

<p begin="01:23:32.750" end="01:23:39.050" style="s2">subordinate as I said for for</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.100" end="01:23:41.420" style="s2">ideological reasons that to have a child</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.050" end="01:23:45.320" style="s2">is to damage the world that would be one</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.420" end="01:23:47.450" style="s2">part of it or to subordinate yourself to</p>

<p begin="01:23:53.120" end="01:23:59.060" style="s2">ambition but that&#39;s so shallow and so</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.990" end="01:24:02.000" style="s2">superficial all of that and so self</p>

<p begin="01:24:08.990" end="01:24:15.470" style="s2">necessary manner and having a family is</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.400" end="01:24:17.660" style="s2">definitely one of those it&#39;s maybe half</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.470" end="01:24:20.060" style="s2">of your life it might be more than that</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.660" end="01:24:21.980" style="s2">but it&#39;s definitely at least half your</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.060" end="01:24:24.350" style="s2">life you figure intimate relationship</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.980" end="01:24:26.390" style="s2">that&#39;s a big part of your life your</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.350" end="01:24:27.980" style="s2">career and the useful things and</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.390" end="01:24:33.010" style="s2">productive things that you do outside</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.980" end="01:24:36.670" style="s2">that&#39;s another part but fundamentally</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.010" end="01:24:36.670" style="s2">fundamentally it&#39;s family</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.380" end="01:24:52.670" style="s2">paulla how do I stop emotional eating I</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.460" end="01:24:55.190" style="s2">am prone to addictive behavior makes me</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.670" end="01:24:58.040" style="s2">feel in control I would appreciate your</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.190" end="01:25:01.159" style="s2">thoughts on this look Paula the first</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.040" end="01:25:03.260" style="s2">thing that I would suggest is that you</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.159" end="01:25:08.150" style="s2">probably eat because it makes you feel</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.260" end="01:25:11.000" style="s2">better I mean physically so lots of</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.150" end="01:25:13.389" style="s2">times I&#39;ve had clients this has happened</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.000" end="01:25:16.400" style="s2">endless numbers of times I&#39;ve seen it</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.389" end="01:25:19.130" style="s2">where people are extremely anxious and</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.400" end="01:25:21.500" style="s2">nervous and they eat something and they</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.130" end="01:25:23.719" style="s2">feel way better and the reason they feel</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.500" end="01:25:25.610" style="s2">better is because well they&#39;ve either</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.719" end="01:25:28.340" style="s2">not been eating enough or they&#39;re eating</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.610" end="01:25:30.500" style="s2">wrong now I constantly recommend it to</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.340" end="01:25:33.530" style="s2">my clients if they were arguing with</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.500" end="01:25:34.880" style="s2">their spouses and this is something I</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.530" end="01:25:37.489" style="s2">could generally recommend to everyone</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.880" end="01:25:39.560" style="s2">that&#39;s out there if if the two of you</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.489" end="01:25:44.030" style="s2">are involved in a particularly stupid</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.560" end="01:25:46.940" style="s2">argument then break and have something</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.030" end="01:25:49.630" style="s2">to eat have some cheese have some have</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.940" end="01:25:53.690" style="s2">something that&#39;s protein and fat heavy</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.630" end="01:25:56.000" style="s2">like a snack and wait 10 minutes and</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.690" end="01:25:59.270" style="s2">then talk again and see you might find</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.000" end="01:26:02.630" style="s2">that you&#39;re endlessly more reasonable</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.270" end="01:26:06.980" style="s2">and so I would also say generally</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.630" end="01:26:09.739" style="s2">speaking Paula you should eat a fat and</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.980" end="01:26:11.780" style="s2">protein heavy breakfast and a lot of it</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.739" end="01:26:14.840" style="s2">probably more than you want probably</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.780" end="01:26:18.469" style="s2">more than you would feel comfortable</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.840" end="01:26:21.940" style="s2">with it&#39;s the most important meal of the</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.469" end="01:26:25.280" style="s2">day and it&#39;s possible that your</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.940" end="01:26:27.560" style="s2">dysregulated psycho physiologically so</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.280" end="01:26:29.840" style="s2">that if you get stressed your body over</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.560" end="01:26:32.870" style="s2">produces insulin and takes all the blood</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.840" end="01:26:35.929" style="s2">sugar out of your out of your blood</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.870" end="01:26:38.900" style="s2">system and that makes you anxious and</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.929" end="01:26:40.639" style="s2">and irritable and makes it difficult for</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.900" end="01:26:42.320" style="s2">you to think and then if you eat</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.639" end="01:26:44.300" style="s2">something and it could be something</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.320" end="01:26:46.960" style="s2">sweet although I wouldn&#39;t recommend that</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.300" end="01:26:49.580" style="s2">because it&#39;s a bad medium to long term</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.960" end="01:26:51.830" style="s2">solution if you eat something you</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.580" end="01:26:54.949" style="s2">probably feel way better like literally</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.830" end="01:26:58.310" style="s2">not psychologically so the trick there</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.949" end="01:26:59.060" style="s2">is to eat a big breakfast and then not</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.310" end="01:27:01.430" style="s2">allow you</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.060" end="01:27:04.550" style="s2">self to get hungry during the day you</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.430" end="01:27:06.530" style="s2">know so eat three meals make them a</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.550" end="01:27:08.660" style="s2">decent size and if you need to carry a</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.530" end="01:27:11.780" style="s2">snack or something like that nuts are</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.660" end="01:27:15.440" style="s2">really useful can be really useful if</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.780" end="01:27:17.120" style="s2">you can tolerate them or something like</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.440" end="01:27:23.840" style="s2">beef jerky which i think is actually</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.120" end="01:27:25.490" style="s2">better so try that try eating a big</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.840" end="01:27:27.710" style="s2">breakfast and then try not letting</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.490" end="01:27:30.680" style="s2">yourself get hungry and see if that</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.710" end="01:27:35.120" style="s2">so-called emotional eating decreases now</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.680" end="01:27:37.670" style="s2">what you could do along with that is see</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.120" end="01:27:40.210" style="s2">to what degree you can decrease your</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.670" end="01:27:42.830" style="s2">intake of carbohydrates and sugar</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.210" end="01:27:46.090" style="s2">because that may be causing you a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.830" end="01:27:50.420" style="s2">trouble and I would say if you are</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.090" end="01:27:52.670" style="s2">inclined to eat emotionally don&#39;t eat</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.420" end="01:27:55.220" style="s2">carbohydrates and sugar because it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.670" end="01:28:01.210" style="s2">fix it temporarily but it&#39;ll make it</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.220" end="01:28:03.710" style="s2">worse like an hour later so assume a</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.210" end="01:28:08.590" style="s2">problem with eating habit before you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.710" end="01:28:08.590" style="s2">assuming a psychological problem so</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.250" end="01:28:20.570" style="s2">I&#39;m a Silicon Valley founder and find</p>

<p begin="01:29:52.400" end="01:29:56.750" style="s2">any of that and you have to make it</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.380" end="01:29:58.790" style="s2">known to your peers which would be other</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.750" end="01:30:02.510" style="s2">Silicon Valley founders I would presume</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.790" end="01:30:07.130" style="s2">that you&#39;re not doing any of that and so</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.510" end="01:30:09.890" style="s2">that&#39;s the that&#39;s the best advice that I</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.130" end="01:30:12.110" style="s2">have is don&#39;t start playing the game and</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.890" end="01:30:15.620" style="s2">really keep an eye on your HR people</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.110" end="01:30:20.540" style="s2">because that&#39;s their new pathway to</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.620" end="01:30:24.830" style="s2">unearned power and influence and not of</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.540" end="01:30:27.740" style="s2">an appropriate sort so you know you</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.830" end="01:30:29.620" style="s2">might think as well what your values are</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.740" end="01:30:32.170" style="s2">I don&#39;t mean in a mish</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.620" end="01:30:36.400" style="s2">statement sort of way because I tend to</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.170" end="01:30:39.540" style="s2">think that that&#39;s often casual to the</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.400" end="01:30:42.820" style="s2">point of virtue signaling but you know</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.540" end="01:30:44.890" style="s2">you need to think through what sort of</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.820" end="01:30:46.870" style="s2">organization that you want to have and</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.890" end="01:30:50.140" style="s2">what the principles are going to be and</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.870" end="01:30:53.470" style="s2">make those clear as an alternative story</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.140" end="01:30:56.500" style="s2">to the diversity inclusivity and equity</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.470" end="01:30:58.740" style="s2">rhetoric so that&#39;s what I would</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.500" end="01:30:58.740" style="s2">recommend</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.539" end="01:31:28.130" style="s2">dan I habitually procrastinate on</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.679" end="01:31:29.749" style="s2">important tasks CV writing for example</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.130" end="01:31:30.260" style="s2">for months on end waiting for the right</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.749" end="01:31:32.989" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.260" end="01:31:33.949" style="s2">it is severely holding me back how to</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.989" end="01:31:36.530" style="s2">avoid this</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.949" end="01:31:38.239" style="s2">well I covered that in Chapter four and</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.530" end="01:31:39.769" style="s2">twelve rules for life so you could read</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.239" end="01:31:41.599" style="s2">that that would help</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.769" end="01:31:44.059" style="s2">it&#39;s called comparing yourself to who</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.599" end="01:31:48.579" style="s2">you were yesterday instead of who</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.059" end="01:31:53.380" style="s2">someone else is today look if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.579" end="01:31:56.689" style="s2">procrastinating on your CV writing then</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.380" end="01:31:58.939" style="s2">you&#39;re biting off more than you can chew</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.689" end="01:32:00.949" style="s2">and I would say to some degree it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.939" end="01:32:03.380" style="s2">reflection and I don&#39;t mean this in a</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.949" end="01:32:06.469" style="s2">pejorative way it&#39;s a reflection of a</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.380" end="01:32:09.650" style="s2">lack of humility you think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.469" end="01:32:11.869" style="s2">capable of taking on larger tasks than</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.650" end="01:32:13.999" style="s2">you actually are and the proof of that</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.869" end="01:32:16.130" style="s2">is in what you said you take on these</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.999" end="01:32:18.679" style="s2">large tasks and then you don&#39;t complete</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.130" end="01:32:20.780" style="s2">them so obviously you&#39;re not capable of</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.679" end="01:32:24.260" style="s2">taking on the large tasks and completing</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.780" end="01:32:26.479" style="s2">them so with regards to CV writing you</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.260" end="01:32:28.880" style="s2">you have to sit down and negotiate with</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.479" end="01:32:33.110" style="s2">yourself you have to ask yourself like</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.880" end="01:32:38.179" style="s2">seriously okay I need to do something</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.110" end="01:32:39.919" style="s2">about this CV I need to at least start</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.179" end="01:32:42.919" style="s2">it because obviously you&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.919" end="01:32:44.630" style="s2">finish it unless you start it and then</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.919" end="01:32:46.699" style="s2">you have to ask yourself like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.630" end="01:32:49.249" style="s2">asking someone that you don&#39;t know and</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.699" end="01:32:52.849" style="s2">that you can&#39;t negotiate with very well</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.249" end="01:32:54.979" style="s2">what you might be willing to do like so</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.849" end="01:32:57.079" style="s2">if you come to see a behavior therapist</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.979" end="01:33:00.139" style="s2">and and the problem was well I can&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.079" end="01:33:01.579" style="s2">started on my CV the therapist might say</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.139" end="01:33:03.079" style="s2">well why don&#39;t you just bring your CV</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.579" end="01:33:08.119" style="s2">next week and we&#39;ll take a look at it</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.079" end="01:33:09.979" style="s2">just just uh you know bring it rough</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.119" end="01:33:11.869" style="s2">form don&#39;t all you have to do is</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.979" end="01:33:13.939" style="s2">download and on disk or email it and</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.869" end="01:33:15.530" style="s2">then the person may or may not do that</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.939" end="01:33:18.320" style="s2">and if they don&#39;t do it well then you</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.530" end="01:33:21.050" style="s2">have to find out huh then you may have</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.320" end="01:33:23.360" style="s2">to say okay well I notice you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.050" end="01:33:25.010" style="s2">email mice your CV to me this week so</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.360" end="01:33:28.610" style="s2">how about this how about we make an</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.010" end="01:33:32.239" style="s2">appointment by phone tomorrow at 10:30</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.610" end="01:33:32.750" style="s2">and I&#39;ll phone you or you phone me and</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.239" end="01:33:35.150" style="s2">you&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.750" end="01:33:38.930" style="s2">on your computer and you&#39;ll go through</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.150" end="01:33:41.540" style="s2">your files with me and then you&#39;ll email</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.930" end="01:33:45.050" style="s2">me the CV do you think you can do that</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.540" end="01:33:47.210" style="s2">and then usually people will manage that</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.050" end="01:33:48.770" style="s2">but maybe they come back the next week</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.210" end="01:33:51.620" style="s2">and they haven&#39;t even done that and so</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.770" end="01:33:53.840" style="s2">then you say well look why don&#39;t next</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.620" end="01:33:57.140" style="s2">week why don&#39;t you bring your computer</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.840" end="01:34:00.650" style="s2">or your disk and we&#39;ll go through it</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.140" end="01:34:02.630" style="s2">together and find your CV and bring it</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.650" end="01:34:05.270" style="s2">up on screen and just take a look at it</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.630" end="01:34:07.280" style="s2">you know because actually a CV is quite</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.270" end="01:34:09.440" style="s2">a daunting thing to work on because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.280" end="01:34:11.780" style="s2">your whole past and your whole future</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.440" end="01:34:18.100" style="s2">and so it&#39;s a pretty big dragon the</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.780" end="01:34:22.100" style="s2">trick is to find a piece of the solution</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.100" end="01:34:25.190" style="s2">that you would be willing to engage in</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.100" end="01:34:28.610" style="s2">that you would actually do and so you</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.190" end="01:34:30.950" style="s2">know I might also recommend to one of my</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.610" end="01:34:34.490" style="s2">clients that all they do is go onto</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.950" end="01:34:38.480" style="s2">their computer and find out which folder</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.490" end="01:34:41.630" style="s2">their CV is in and open it just open the</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.480" end="01:34:43.730" style="s2">file or sorry open the folder and then</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.630" end="01:34:46.190" style="s2">if they that&#39;d be one day&#39;s work is just</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.730" end="01:34:48.860" style="s2">go open the folder and then maybe the</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.190" end="01:34:52.100" style="s2">next day is well drag the file onto your</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.860" end="01:34:55.880" style="s2">desktop so it&#39;s there and then maybe the</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.100" end="01:34:58.190" style="s2">next day&#39;s job just open it just open it</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.880" end="01:35:00.650" style="s2">and just like glance at the first page</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.190" end="01:35:02.360" style="s2">and then close it and I know this seems</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.650" end="01:35:04.100" style="s2">ridiculous because you think well I&#39;m an</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.360" end="01:35:07.220" style="s2">adult and I should be able to do more</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.100" end="01:35:09.050" style="s2">than that and maybe you can but it</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.220" end="01:35:10.910" style="s2">sounds like you can&#39;t so you have to</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.050" end="01:35:12.560" style="s2">start where you can start and I also</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.910" end="01:35:14.090" style="s2">recommend to my clients that once they</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.560" end="01:35:16.940" style="s2">make themselves a deal about what</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.090" end="01:35:18.770" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna do they stick to it so if</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.940" end="01:35:23.000" style="s2">the deal is well I&#39;m just going to drag</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.770" end="01:35:25.820" style="s2">the file with my CV in it onto my</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.000" end="01:35:27.410" style="s2">desktop and that&#39;s today&#39;s task I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.820" end="01:35:28.670" style="s2">going to open start working on it</p>
<p begin="01:35:27.410" end="01:35:30.860" style="s2">because once you make a deal with</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.670" end="01:35:32.330" style="s2">yourself especially with regards to</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.860" end="01:35:34.880" style="s2">something you&#39;re afraid of and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.330" end="01:35:38.210" style="s2">avoiding if you push yourself farther</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.880" end="01:35:40.310" style="s2">than what you&#39;ve negotiated with</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.210" end="01:35:42.530" style="s2">yourself honestly then you&#39;ll find that</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.310" end="01:35:45.020" style="s2">you won&#39;t get back to the work because</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.530" end="01:35:46.610" style="s2">you don&#39;t trust your negotiating</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.020" end="01:35:48.470" style="s2">abilities anymore</p>

<p begin="01:38:59.090" end="01:39:05.270" style="s2">handle and be humble enough not to be</p>
<p begin="01:39:02.360" end="01:39:08.090" style="s2">too irritated at yourself when you find</p>
<p begin="01:39:05.270" end="01:39:11.409" style="s2">out just how small those pieces have to</p>
<p begin="01:39:08.090" end="01:39:14.619" style="s2">be in order for you to successfully</p>
