<p begin="00:02:14.800" end="00:02:19.280" style="s2">focused on the board</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.239" end="00:02:22.400" style="s2">so hopefully for all of that we&#39;ll get</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.280" end="00:02:23.440" style="s2">everything uh working well okay so we</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.400" end="00:02:26.560" style="s2">were taking a look</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.440" end="00:02:28.160" style="s2">at uh the epicurean</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.560" end="00:02:30.000" style="s2">and we&#39;ve up until now we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.160" end="00:02:31.920" style="s2">concentrating on one of the two polls of</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.000" end="00:02:34.239" style="s2">epicureanism which is dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.920" end="00:02:36.239" style="s2">our our desires dealing with pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.239" end="00:02:38.879" style="s2">now we want to move from</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.239" end="00:02:39.599" style="s2">the discussion of desire uh to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.879" end="00:02:42.720" style="s2">discussion</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.599" end="00:02:43.440" style="s2">of fear of course uh the two are related</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.720" end="00:02:45.440" style="s2">because fear</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.440" end="00:02:47.360" style="s2">is usually a sense that something that</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.440" end="00:02:48.480" style="s2">we desire is under threat so they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.360" end="00:02:49.680" style="s2">completely separate</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.480" end="00:02:52.879" style="s2">but we are moving to a different</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.680" end="00:02:54.800" style="s2">emphasis now i</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.879" end="00:02:56.319" style="s2">am very much in the same mind with</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.800" end="00:02:59.200" style="s2">mclennan on this</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.319" end="00:03:00.319" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t regard epicureanism as</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.200" end="00:03:02.959" style="s2">sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.319" end="00:03:04.000" style="s2">he regards it as a necessary and</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.959" end="00:03:05.200" style="s2">powerful</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.000" end="00:03:07.280" style="s2">first stage i like to think of</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.200" end="00:03:09.760" style="s2">epicureanism as primary school</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.280" end="00:03:10.800" style="s2">stoicism is high school and neoplatonism</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.760" end="00:03:13.120" style="s2">as university</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.800" end="00:03:14.480" style="s2">i think it&#39;s important to remember that</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.120" end="00:03:16.000" style="s2">especially with the topics that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.480" end="00:03:19.440" style="s2">going to wrestle with today</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.000" end="00:03:21.360" style="s2">um now while i find well i find</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.440" end="00:03:22.879" style="s2">with mcclellan and others that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.360" end="00:03:25.120" style="s2">epicurean</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.879" end="00:03:26.159" style="s2">cures or solutions that we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.120" end="00:03:28.799" style="s2">talk about today</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.159" end="00:03:29.680" style="s2">are not sufficient i nevertheless</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.799" end="00:03:32.000" style="s2">acknowledge</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.680" end="00:03:33.519" style="s2">that many people throughout the ancient</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.000" end="00:03:36.080" style="s2">world many people</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.519" end="00:03:37.519" style="s2">found them sufficient and that means</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.080" end="00:03:38.239" style="s2">that they are at least should be</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.519" end="00:03:40.480" style="s2">recognized</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.239" end="00:03:41.360" style="s2">as powerful and therefore worthy of</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.480" end="00:03:43.519" style="s2">respect</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.360" end="00:03:44.480" style="s2">and that they can at least be extremely</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.519" end="00:03:48.239" style="s2">helpful</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.480" end="00:03:50.159" style="s2">if not you know ultimate and</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.239" end="00:03:51.519" style="s2">ultimate in their ability to afford us</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.159" end="00:03:53.200" style="s2">to deal with some of the ultimate issues</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.519" end="00:03:57.040" style="s2">we&#39;re going to talk about today</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.200" end="00:04:00.480" style="s2">all right so the dealing with fear</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.040" end="00:04:02.799" style="s2">um so there&#39;s a kind of fear that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.480" end="00:04:06.319" style="s2">being talked about here it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.799" end="00:04:07.760" style="s2">um it&#39;s not so much instinctive fear</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.319" end="00:04:09.840" style="s2">that we get as biological</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.760" end="00:04:11.439" style="s2">entities uh the kind of fear that we</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.840" end="00:04:12.239" style="s2">share with cats and dogs and things like</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.439" end="00:04:13.439" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.239" end="00:04:14.959" style="s2">because of course being instinctive</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.439" end="00:04:15.760" style="s2">there&#39;s not too much we can do about</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.959" end="00:04:17.759" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.760" end="00:04:19.440" style="s2">uh what the epicureans though are</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.759" end="00:04:23.360" style="s2">talking about is</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.440" end="00:04:25.199" style="s2">um the way in which we self-terrify</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.360" end="00:04:28.560" style="s2">ourselves uh because of our</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.199" end="00:04:32.560" style="s2">undisciplined imaginations so</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.560" end="00:04:32.560" style="s2">let me say that again we self-terrify</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.080" end="00:04:43.840" style="s2">because of undisciplined</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.479" end="00:04:47.280" style="s2">imagination</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.160" end="00:04:56.000" style="s2">okay so let&#39;s take a quick look at this</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.240" end="00:04:57.520" style="s2">we can help procure us out by following</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.000" end="00:04:59.840" style="s2">his model of using the best science of</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.520" end="00:05:02.080" style="s2">the time what is our best account</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.840" end="00:05:02.960" style="s2">of what imagination is and here i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.080" end="00:05:05.759" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.960" end="00:05:06.960" style="s2">uh what&#39;s called the imaginary like</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.759" end="00:05:09.440" style="s2">mental imagery</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.960" end="00:05:10.960" style="s2">not what corbyn calls the imaginal or</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.440" end="00:05:12.720" style="s2">we&#39;ll come back to the imaginal much</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.960" end="00:05:15.919" style="s2">later</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.720" end="00:05:16.720" style="s2">so the best idea uh and because i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.919" end="00:05:19.039" style="s2">given you some</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.720" end="00:05:19.840" style="s2">background on this i can make use of it</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.039" end="00:05:22.840" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.840" end="00:05:25.440" style="s2">that imagination is basically the</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.840" end="00:05:28.560" style="s2">predictive</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.440" end="00:05:28.560" style="s2">prehension function</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.800" end="00:05:33.759" style="s2">so if you remember when we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.759" end="00:05:35.440" style="s2">savoring</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.759" end="00:05:37.759" style="s2">there&#39;s perception which is the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.440" end="00:05:39.199" style="s2">up opening up of new information from</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.759" end="00:05:41.759" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.199" end="00:05:43.199" style="s2">and the prehension is the act of looking</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.759" end="00:05:47.680" style="s2">for patterns</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.199" end="00:05:50.560" style="s2">finding patterns seeking patterns</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.680" end="00:05:51.840" style="s2">and the idea of what&#39;s called predictive</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.560" end="00:05:53.840" style="s2">processing is</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.840" end="00:05:55.199" style="s2">that what your brain does is it tries to</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.840" end="00:05:57.600" style="s2">predict the patterns</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.199" end="00:05:59.039" style="s2">it&#39;s going to encounter before it</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.600" end="00:06:00.319" style="s2">encounters them because that&#39;s way more</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.039" end="00:06:02.800" style="s2">adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.319" end="00:06:04.720" style="s2">and then what imagination is is when you</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.800" end="00:06:07.440" style="s2">run this predictive</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.720" end="00:06:09.039" style="s2">prediction apprehension of patterns</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.440" end="00:06:10.560" style="s2">independent of getting new information</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.039" end="00:06:12.400" style="s2">from the world that&#39;s why we often close</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.560" end="00:06:14.720" style="s2">our eyes in order to imagine better</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.400" end="00:06:15.600" style="s2">right so all you&#39;re getting is the</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.720" end="00:06:18.880" style="s2">top-down</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.600" end="00:06:20.560" style="s2">prediction of patterns that are going to</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.880" end="00:06:22.880" style="s2">be grasped in the world</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.560" end="00:06:25.199" style="s2">and you&#39;re actually cutting off all the</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.880" end="00:06:28.800" style="s2">flow of incoming</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.199" end="00:06:31.440" style="s2">information now the problem with that is</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.800" end="00:06:32.960" style="s2">perception gives you the data that</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.440" end="00:06:33.759" style="s2">corrects when these predictions are</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.960" end="00:06:36.400" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.759" end="00:06:37.759" style="s2">so when we move to imagination we are</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.400" end="00:06:39.840" style="s2">we&#39;re engaging something that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.759" end="00:06:41.520" style="s2">powerful very needed for us i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.840" end="00:06:43.600" style="s2">i&#39;m not a calvinist i don&#39;t hate the</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.520" end="00:06:45.759" style="s2">imagination but we have to remember that</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.600" end="00:06:49.120" style="s2">imagination on its own</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.759" end="00:06:52.720" style="s2">is very very lopsided</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.120" end="00:06:56.880" style="s2">it&#39;s because it is</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.720" end="00:07:00.080" style="s2">prediction without data it is a place</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.880" end="00:07:01.120" style="s2">that is very susceptible to cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.080" end="00:07:04.000" style="s2">bias</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.120" end="00:07:05.599" style="s2">because without that incoming data our</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.000" end="00:07:07.840" style="s2">theorizing if you&#39;ll allow me to use</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.599" end="00:07:10.880" style="s2">that as a metaphor is unconstrained</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.840" end="00:07:13.599" style="s2">and our worst biases come to the fore</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.880" end="00:07:15.199" style="s2">and so an undisciplined imagination is</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.599" end="00:07:17.759" style="s2">an imagination</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.199" end="00:07:18.639" style="s2">that is especially rife with cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.759" end="00:07:20.720" style="s2">biasing</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.639" end="00:07:22.160" style="s2">and the problem in our culture is we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.720" end="00:07:23.039" style="s2">had two traditions around the</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.160" end="00:07:25.199" style="s2">imagination</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.039" end="00:07:26.639" style="s2">one i&#39;ve just mentioned calvin it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.199" end="00:07:28.960" style="s2">puritanical thing that says</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.639" end="00:07:30.400" style="s2">you know the imagination is a permanent</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.960" end="00:07:31.199" style="s2">factory for the production of idols the</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.400" end="00:07:32.639" style="s2">imaginati</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.199" end="00:07:34.240" style="s2">you know idol hands or the devil&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.639" end="00:07:36.639" style="s2">workshop and and then we&#39;ve had the</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.240" end="00:07:41.680" style="s2">romantics who said that imagination is</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.639" end="00:07:43.520" style="s2">is the root to god etc and both of these</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.680" end="00:07:45.120" style="s2">as they were at war with themselves in</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.520" end="00:07:48.160" style="s2">their extremism</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.120" end="00:07:51.759" style="s2">both of them ignore the proper</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.160" end="00:07:53.599" style="s2">education of the imagination</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.759" end="00:07:54.960" style="s2">and not just repressing it like the</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.599" end="00:07:58.000" style="s2">calvinist and not just</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.960" end="00:08:01.120" style="s2">expressing it like the romantics</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.000" end="00:08:03.759" style="s2">so we need i one way of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.120" end="00:08:04.720" style="s2">the epicureans is that they had a method</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.759" end="00:08:08.720" style="s2">for trying</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.720" end="00:08:12.720" style="s2">to educate the imagination</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.720" end="00:08:16.639" style="s2">because unconstrained the imagination</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.720" end="00:08:19.680" style="s2">is a place that is</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.639" end="00:08:21.280" style="s2">beset with cognitive bias but properly</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.680" end="00:08:23.039" style="s2">educated and think about this this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.280" end="00:08:24.240" style="s2">the befriending there&#39;s no enemy worse</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.039" end="00:08:26.960" style="s2">than your own mind and body</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.240" end="00:08:28.960" style="s2">but there&#39;s no friend that&#39;s greater but</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.960" end="00:08:30.720" style="s2">an educated imagination is one of our</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.960" end="00:08:33.599" style="s2">most powerful allies</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.720" end="00:08:34.479" style="s2">okay so let&#39;s think of it that way so</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.599" end="00:08:38.640" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.479" end="00:08:38.640" style="s2">they have what they call the four-fold</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.839" end="00:08:41.839" style="s2">cure</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.320" end="00:08:46.800" style="s2">for fear where fear again isn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.120" end="00:08:47.600" style="s2">instinctive taking your hand away from</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.800" end="00:08:50.399" style="s2">the fire</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.600" end="00:08:51.200" style="s2">but the way in which we sort of terrify</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.399" end="00:08:55.120" style="s2">ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.200" end="00:08:58.160" style="s2">with our imagination so the four full</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.120" end="00:08:59.600" style="s2">cure is a set of maxims</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.160" end="00:09:01.440" style="s2">and so you&#39;re supposed to use it in</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.600" end="00:09:03.680" style="s2">maximization and what</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.440" end="00:09:04.720" style="s2">we&#39;re going to learn today is the</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.680" end="00:09:08.160" style="s2">practice of</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.720" end="00:09:11.600" style="s2">reflective explication okay</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.160" end="00:09:13.519" style="s2">so a maxim has a lot of ideas compressed</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.600" end="00:09:15.279" style="s2">so it&#39;s easy to transport around and</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.519" end="00:09:16.959" style="s2">remember but you have to remember that a</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.279" end="00:09:19.200" style="s2">maxim is just a remember</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.959" end="00:09:20.959" style="s2">doorway and the point of a maxim is</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.200" end="00:09:23.279" style="s2">always to make explicit that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.959" end="00:09:26.480" style="s2">explicate means explicate is not</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.279" end="00:09:26.959" style="s2">a synonym for imagine explicate means to</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.480" end="00:09:30.080" style="s2">make</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.959" end="00:09:31.279" style="s2">explicit what is implicit okay we want</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.080" end="00:09:34.839" style="s2">to explicate</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.279" end="00:09:37.440" style="s2">the maximum and we want to do this</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.839" end="00:09:41.920" style="s2">reflectively</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.440" end="00:09:41.920" style="s2">okay so reflective explication</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.080" end="00:09:45.680" style="s2">okay so let&#39;s take a look at these</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.360" end="00:09:46.480" style="s2">maxims and go through them and explicate</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.680" end="00:09:47.680" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.480" end="00:09:49.680" style="s2">we&#39;re going to explicate them</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.680" end="00:09:51.120" style="s2">reflectively what are we reflecting on</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.680" end="00:09:53.600" style="s2">we&#39;re reflecting on</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.120" end="00:09:54.880" style="s2">how we can educate our moments of</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.600" end="00:09:57.200" style="s2">imagination</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.880" end="00:09:58.240" style="s2">so what i&#39;m teaching here is something</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.200" end="00:10:02.320" style="s2">that you bring</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.240" end="00:10:05.440" style="s2">into practice when you start to imagine</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.320" end="00:10:08.959" style="s2">when you start to imagine</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.440" end="00:10:12.160" style="s2">okay so the first of the fourfold cures</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.959" end="00:10:13.600" style="s2">is a very famous one and</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.160" end="00:10:15.279" style="s2">we&#39;ve got to do some work on it because</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.600" end="00:10:17.200" style="s2">its relevancy has changed i think</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.279" end="00:10:20.959" style="s2">because we&#39;re not in the same situation</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.200" end="00:10:24.000" style="s2">the gods or god</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.959" end="00:10:24.000" style="s2">are not to be feared</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.519" end="00:10:31.680" style="s2">okay so let&#39;s put this into the first</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.079" end="00:10:33.120" style="s2">the historical situation</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.680" end="00:10:35.200" style="s2">there&#39;s a multiplicity of gods in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.120" end="00:10:36.800" style="s2">ancient world they&#39;re very capricious</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.200" end="00:10:38.800" style="s2">um they don&#39;t act according to moral</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.800" end="00:10:40.079" style="s2">principles and then what epicurus</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.800" end="00:10:42.480" style="s2">basically argues</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.079" end="00:10:44.240" style="s2">is those kinds of gods don&#39;t exist the</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.480" end="00:10:45.760" style="s2">only kinds of gods that could exist are</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.240" end="00:10:47.920" style="s2">ones that are sages</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.760" end="00:10:49.920" style="s2">that have wisdom and therefore they</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.920" end="00:10:51.839" style="s2">would have no reason to be capricious or</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.920" end="00:10:54.000" style="s2">act immorally towards us etc</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.839" end="00:10:55.920" style="s2">and that sort of aspect of it has</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.000" end="00:10:58.320" style="s2">largely been taken care of</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.920" end="00:10:59.760" style="s2">uh by a couple of millennia of</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.320" end="00:11:00.240" style="s2">christianity in which we have been</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.760" end="00:11:03.200" style="s2">taught</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.240" end="00:11:04.880" style="s2">that god is good or or and and you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.200" end="00:11:05.680" style="s2">and i&#39;m not advocating for the existence</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.880" end="00:11:07.440" style="s2">of god uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.680" end="00:11:09.519" style="s2">i mean i&#39;m gonna put that problem aside</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.440" end="00:11:10.800" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna talk about it in the series of</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.519" end="00:11:14.560" style="s2">the god beyond god</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.800" end="00:11:17.680" style="s2">what i think we can draw from this</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.560" end="00:11:18.240" style="s2">are two different fears that were</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.680" end="00:11:20.480" style="s2">present</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.240" end="00:11:21.600" style="s2">behind this mythological representation</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.480" end="00:11:24.079" style="s2">in the ancient world</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.600" end="00:11:24.720" style="s2">that are still relevant to us today that</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.079" end="00:11:28.320" style="s2">the first</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.720" end="00:11:30.800" style="s2">is the fear of fate where fate</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.320" end="00:11:31.760" style="s2">doesn&#39;t necessarily mean destiny fate</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.800" end="00:11:35.519" style="s2">means</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.760" end="00:11:38.560" style="s2">um the the how things are beyond</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.519" end="00:11:41.760" style="s2">our control beyond our understanding</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.560" end="00:11:43.360" style="s2">and uh a book i recommend about how this</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.760" end="00:11:45.839" style="s2">was the one of the central issues</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.360" end="00:11:47.200" style="s2">in the ancient world is a book called</p>

<p begin="00:11:47.200" end="00:11:53.360" style="s2">uh by margaret visser beyond fate and</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.959" end="00:11:54.880" style="s2">notice the title beyond fate</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.360" end="00:11:56.480" style="s2">what what was going on in the ancient</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.880" end="00:11:58.079" style="s2">world was a way of</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.480" end="00:12:00.000" style="s2">trying to find a way of living that was</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.079" end="00:12:03.360" style="s2">beyond fate um</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.000" end="00:12:06.560" style="s2">notice that we get this word out of it</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.360" end="00:12:09.120" style="s2">fatality fatality doesn&#39;t or didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.560" end="00:12:12.240" style="s2">originally mean having to do with death</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.120" end="00:12:14.800" style="s2">fatality meant when something struck us</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.240" end="00:12:16.639" style="s2">that was beyond our control beyond our</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.800" end="00:12:19.440" style="s2">understanding beyond the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.639" end="00:12:20.880" style="s2">structure of our lives right death of</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.440" end="00:12:22.800" style="s2">course is a primary example</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.880" end="00:12:24.320" style="s2">of being struck by something beyond our</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.800" end="00:12:25.440" style="s2">control and outside the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.320" end="00:12:27.839" style="s2">control of our life</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.440" end="00:12:29.519" style="s2">but many things many things</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.839" end="00:12:32.160" style="s2">relationships career</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.519" end="00:12:32.959" style="s2">many things are subject to fatality in</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.160" end="00:12:34.880" style="s2">that sense</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.959" end="00:12:36.639" style="s2">so please remember that please remember</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.880" end="00:12:40.480" style="s2">that we&#39;re going to need to know that</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.639" end="00:12:43.920" style="s2">especially when we talk about stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.480" end="00:12:45.440" style="s2">okay so what this turns what</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.920" end="00:12:47.839" style="s2">what you can see in here is this is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.440" end="00:12:52.560" style="s2">fear of two facts about us our finitude</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.839" end="00:12:56.880" style="s2">that we are finite and our fallibility</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.560" end="00:12:59.920" style="s2">that we will always be making mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.880" end="00:13:02.320" style="s2">okay and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.920" end="00:13:02.959" style="s2">the basic answer and that comes from</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.320" end="00:13:04.639" style="s2">visser&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.959" end="00:13:06.240" style="s2">title that the ancient world came up</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.639" end="00:13:08.240" style="s2">with beyond fate</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.240" end="00:13:09.360" style="s2">was a recognition that although human</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.240" end="00:13:12.320" style="s2">beings are subject</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.360" end="00:13:13.040" style="s2">to finitude infallibility they are also</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.320" end="00:13:15.360" style="s2">capable</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.040" end="00:13:17.440" style="s2">of transcendence they are capable of</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.360" end="00:13:18.720" style="s2">transcendence and virtue so virtuous</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.440" end="00:13:21.839" style="s2">transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.720" end="00:13:23.440" style="s2">right was the main idea</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.839" end="00:13:25.600" style="s2">and you may say well that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.440" end="00:13:27.200" style="s2">protect me it doesn&#39;t protect you</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.600" end="00:13:28.720" style="s2">from the events and here&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.200" end="00:13:30.399" style="s2">stoicism is going to be much more</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.720" end="00:13:32.399" style="s2">helpful than epicureanism</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.399" end="00:13:34.240" style="s2">but it protects you to a large degree</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.399" end="00:13:34.880" style="s2">from a meaning from the meaning of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.240" end="00:13:37.279" style="s2">events</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.880" end="00:13:38.959" style="s2">remember we&#39;re not talking about you</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.279" end="00:13:40.000" style="s2">know events that we have an instinctive</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.959" end="00:13:42.160" style="s2">reaction to</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.000" end="00:13:43.040" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about the meaning of</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.160" end="00:13:46.560" style="s2">events when</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.040" end="00:13:49.600" style="s2">we imagine about them or project</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.560" end="00:13:52.880" style="s2">our projects or concerns onto them</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.600" end="00:13:54.720" style="s2">so the idea uh that we are capable of</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.880" end="00:13:57.839" style="s2">finite transcendence however</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.720" end="00:14:00.240" style="s2">isn&#39;t really that well discussed</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.839" end="00:14:02.639" style="s2">in epicureanism so here&#39;s one area where</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.240" end="00:14:04.399" style="s2">i think it&#39;s inadequate</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.639" end="00:14:06.160" style="s2">i think epicureanism provides us a place</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.399" end="00:14:08.880" style="s2">where we can start to experience it</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.160" end="00:14:10.240" style="s2">like in adoraxia but it wasn&#39;t very well</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.880" end="00:14:12.720" style="s2">discussed</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.240" end="00:14:14.399" style="s2">when we get to neoplatonism stoicism and</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.720" end="00:14:17.120" style="s2">then neoplatonism we&#39;ll see that there</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.399" end="00:14:19.360" style="s2">is a very good way of</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.120" end="00:14:20.639" style="s2">addressing finite transcendence but for</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.360" end="00:14:21.440" style="s2">those of you who have been through the</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.639" end="00:14:24.000" style="s2">course already</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.440" end="00:14:24.880" style="s2">you already have a lot of that empowered</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.000" end="00:14:26.240" style="s2">in you</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.880" end="00:14:28.399" style="s2">from the eastern tradition because</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.240" end="00:14:30.079" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly what meditation and</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.399" end="00:14:31.600" style="s2">contemplation bring about they have you</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.079" end="00:14:33.760" style="s2">accept your finitude</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.600" end="00:14:35.360" style="s2">while affording your capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.760" end="00:14:37.519" style="s2">virtuous transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.360" end="00:14:39.040" style="s2">neoplatonism says that what we are</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.519" end="00:14:41.680" style="s2">actually looking for</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.040" end="00:14:42.560" style="s2">as a response to fate is to come into</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.680" end="00:14:46.399" style="s2">contact</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.560" end="00:14:48.240" style="s2">with what is most real what is most real</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.399" end="00:14:50.399" style="s2">and that&#39;s of course what transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.240" end="00:14:51.519" style="s2">is it&#39;s a longing to come into right</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.399" end="00:14:54.399" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.519" end="00:14:56.480" style="s2">with what is ultimately real and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.399" end="00:14:58.160" style="s2">degree to which we can cultivate a right</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.480" end="00:14:58.959" style="s2">relationship with what is ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.160" end="00:15:02.240" style="s2">real</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.959" end="00:15:03.600" style="s2">we can address this side so</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.240" end="00:15:05.279" style="s2">there&#39;s a little bit here in</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.600" end="00:15:06.399" style="s2">epicureanism but i think this is where</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.279" end="00:15:08.480" style="s2">we will need</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.399" end="00:15:10.560" style="s2">uh neoplatonism to re stoicism and</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.480" end="00:15:12.399" style="s2">neoplate and neoplatonism to really give</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.560" end="00:15:14.480" style="s2">us a more comprehensive answer</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.399" end="00:15:16.240" style="s2">now here is one where the epicureans did</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.480" end="00:15:19.680" style="s2">do a lot</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.240" end="00:15:23.839" style="s2">and this is um about</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.680" end="00:15:23.839" style="s2">the afterlife um</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.079" end="00:15:30.000" style="s2">and so this is a very of course fraught</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.440" end="00:15:31.680" style="s2">issue uh for a lot of people and i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.000" end="00:15:32.240" style="s2">try and speak on the epicureans behalf</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.680" end="00:15:35.040" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.240" end="00:15:36.399" style="s2">um my own view i can&#39;t keep my own view</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.040" end="00:15:38.639" style="s2">completely separate from this</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.399" end="00:15:39.519" style="s2">but i&#39;m trying its best to mediate</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.639" end="00:15:42.320" style="s2">epicurus</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.519" end="00:15:44.079" style="s2">to you a reminder by the way that uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.320" end="00:15:44.800" style="s2">monday wednesdays and fridays are longer</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.079" end="00:15:46.079" style="s2">classes</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.800" end="00:15:48.160" style="s2">we&#39;re not going to get through all of</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.079" end="00:15:49.759" style="s2">this lesson today we&#39;re going to have</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.160" end="00:15:51.199" style="s2">this week is going to be a three dharma</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.759" end="00:15:53.680" style="s2">day monday</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.199" end="00:15:54.320" style="s2">wednesday and friday will all be dormant</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.680" end="00:15:57.360" style="s2">days</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.320" end="00:16:00.720" style="s2">okay so the afterlife</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.360" end="00:16:04.560" style="s2">okay so we can make use of epicurus here</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.720" end="00:16:04.560" style="s2">um and</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.399" end="00:16:10.639" style="s2">scientifically improbable okay</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.440" end="00:16:19.120" style="s2">so the idea that something of me</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.000" end="00:16:20.639" style="s2">can survive the the undeniable death of</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.120" end="00:16:24.320" style="s2">my brain and body</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.639" end="00:16:27.600" style="s2">um is coming increasingly um improbable</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.320" end="00:16:29.759" style="s2">as our knowledge of the brain and</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.600" end="00:16:30.639" style="s2">the mind&#39;s relationship to the brain</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.759" end="00:16:33.839" style="s2">grows</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.639" end="00:16:35.199" style="s2">um it&#39;s coming to the and so and this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.839" end="00:16:36.959" style="s2">something taken very seriously by</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.199" end="00:16:37.920" style="s2">foreign cognitive science we are deeply</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.959" end="00:16:40.560" style="s2">embodied</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.920" end="00:16:41.279" style="s2">um the idea that our cognition could in</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.560" end="00:16:43.600" style="s2">any way</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.279" end="00:16:44.800" style="s2">exist or function separately from our</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.600" end="00:16:48.399" style="s2">embodied brain</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.800" end="00:16:51.440" style="s2">is becoming really</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.399" end="00:16:54.079" style="s2">deeply deeply questionable um</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.440" end="00:16:55.360" style="s2">so there&#39;s that but you say well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.079" end="00:16:58.160" style="s2">not based on science</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.360" end="00:16:58.639" style="s2">and that&#39;s right and i got acknowledged</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.160" end="00:17:00.160" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.639" end="00:17:02.240" style="s2">that&#39;s where we have to acknowledge that</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.160" end="00:17:03.759" style="s2">we&#39;re using imagination</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.240" end="00:17:05.600" style="s2">we&#39;re thinking mythically which doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.759" end="00:17:08.640" style="s2">mean we&#39;re necessarily thinking falsely</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.600" end="00:17:11.919" style="s2">i&#39;m not simplistic like that</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.640" end="00:17:12.720" style="s2">but then the epicureans right did a lot</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.919" end="00:17:15.760" style="s2">to try and</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.720" end="00:17:17.600" style="s2">sort of critique the mythology</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.760" end="00:17:19.039" style="s2">of the afterlife in their world what can</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.600" end="00:17:20.799" style="s2">we do about ours well</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.039" end="00:17:22.400" style="s2">for me this is what i do you may find it</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.799" end="00:17:25.360" style="s2">helpful and here&#39;s again where i go</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.400" end="00:17:26.799" style="s2">outside epicurus the eastern traditions</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.360" end="00:17:27.919" style="s2">have a very different view of</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.799" end="00:17:31.120" style="s2">immortality</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.919" end="00:17:32.720" style="s2">than the west life after death it is</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.120" end="00:17:35.120" style="s2">viewed with horror</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.720" end="00:17:36.799" style="s2">personal immortality is not thought to</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.120" end="00:17:38.720" style="s2">be a good thing</p>

<p begin="00:17:38.720" end="00:17:42.799" style="s2">horrific thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.840" end="00:17:44.000" style="s2">because we are we are we are finite and</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.799" end="00:17:47.200" style="s2">we&#39;re fallible</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.000" end="00:17:50.880" style="s2">and extending that uh forever and ever</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.200" end="00:17:53.039" style="s2">would be uh horrible but this is why the</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.880" end="00:17:54.480" style="s2">let&#39;s think of a vedanta the the thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.039" end="00:17:56.480" style="s2">you seek is moksa</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.480" end="00:17:57.600" style="s2">muksha you seek release from</p>

<p begin="00:17:57.600" end="00:18:04.320" style="s2">you seek release from immortality or</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.799" end="00:18:07.440" style="s2">nirvana to blow out you seek release</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.320" end="00:18:08.480" style="s2">from personal immortality because if you</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.440" end="00:18:10.240" style="s2">think about it</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.480" end="00:18:11.679" style="s2">what what do you what would you want</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.240" end="00:18:12.799" style="s2">well i want to just keep doing all the</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.679" end="00:18:15.919" style="s2">things that i do</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.799" end="00:18:17.280" style="s2">but forever and</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.919" end="00:18:18.880" style="s2">would you want to do them would you want</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.280" end="00:18:19.840" style="s2">to watch your friends die well i need my</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.880" end="00:18:22.400" style="s2">friends to all keep</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.840" end="00:18:24.240" style="s2">living forever and then you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.400" end="00:18:25.600" style="s2">be living with them forever can you even</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.240" end="00:18:28.000" style="s2">live with anybody</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.600" end="00:18:29.280" style="s2">more one or two people for a lifetime</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.000" end="00:18:32.240" style="s2">think about how hard it is to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.280" end="00:18:34.080" style="s2">married and then but my friends are</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.240" end="00:18:36.000" style="s2">going to need their friends and family</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.080" end="00:18:37.840" style="s2">and their friends and family and their</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.000" end="00:18:41.039" style="s2">friends and family and then the work</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.840" end="00:18:44.080" style="s2">so what you want is the world to freeze</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.039" end="00:18:45.360" style="s2">but with that forever would that be a</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.080" end="00:18:47.360" style="s2">good thing</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.360" end="00:18:48.799" style="s2">do you really want that see this is what</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.360" end="00:18:51.520" style="s2">i mean you have to</p>

<p begin="00:19:50.960" end="00:19:56.559" style="s2">in which immortality is imagined</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.000" end="00:19:57.600" style="s2">in a fuller richer way and revealed to</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.559" end="00:20:00.640" style="s2">be something</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.600" end="00:20:06.960" style="s2">potentially quite horrific</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.640" end="00:20:09.200" style="s2">okay so you say that&#39;s all fine and good</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.960" end="00:20:12.080" style="s2">and that&#39;s not what was really going on</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.200" end="00:20:21.840" style="s2">what&#39;s really going on in immortality</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.080" end="00:20:21.840" style="s2">is the fear of death</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.080" end="00:20:27.520" style="s2">so what we&#39;re really trying to do is</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.039" end="00:20:29.280" style="s2">avoid our mortality</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.520" end="00:20:34.880" style="s2">um that&#39;s what&#39;s and now this is where</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.280" end="00:20:36.640" style="s2">the epicureans are terrifically helpful</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.880" end="00:20:38.240" style="s2">once again we must make a distinction</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.640" end="00:20:39.520" style="s2">between that you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.240" end="00:20:41.840" style="s2">a version of the distinction i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.520" end="00:20:43.760" style="s2">already made we must distinguish between</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.840" end="00:20:44.159" style="s2">our fear of death as an instinctive</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.760" end="00:20:46.000" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.159" end="00:20:47.919" style="s2">like avoiding the fire which we share</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.000" end="00:20:48.960" style="s2">with all animals and our fear of our</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.919" end="00:20:51.360" style="s2">mortality</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.960" end="00:20:52.320" style="s2">animals are not aware of their mortality</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.360" end="00:20:54.400" style="s2">they fear</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.320" end="00:20:55.919" style="s2">they instinctively avoid threats to</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.400" end="00:20:57.919" style="s2">their biological life</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.919" end="00:20:59.840" style="s2">but they do not have the capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.919" end="00:21:02.080" style="s2">fall into despair</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.840" end="00:21:03.200" style="s2">about their mortality and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.080" end="00:21:07.440" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about here</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.200" end="00:21:09.600" style="s2">the despair about your mortality</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.440" end="00:21:10.720" style="s2">so there&#39;s two things that need to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.600" end="00:21:13.200" style="s2">separated here</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.720" end="00:21:15.360" style="s2">which the epicureans do one is the fear</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.200" end="00:21:19.679" style="s2">of non-existence</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.360" end="00:21:19.679" style="s2">and the other is the fear of dying</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.559" end="00:21:33.200" style="s2">okay so the epicureans say the fear of</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.080" end="00:21:34.240" style="s2">non-existence</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.200" end="00:21:35.919" style="s2">and then what they&#39;re going to try and</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.240" end="00:21:38.640" style="s2">do is they&#39;re going to try and say</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.919" end="00:21:38.640" style="s2">you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.440" end="00:21:44.000" style="s2">imagining in a self-contradictory manner</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.640" end="00:21:46.799" style="s2">first of all they say</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.000" end="00:21:48.880" style="s2">you don&#39;t fear non-existence the thought</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.799" end="00:21:50.400" style="s2">of non-existence isn&#39;t itself terrifying</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.880" end="00:21:53.039" style="s2">and what they do is they say</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.400" end="00:21:55.520" style="s2">what i want you to do is imagine all of</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.039" end="00:21:58.080" style="s2">the time before you existed</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.520" end="00:21:59.600" style="s2">you weren&#39;t there just imagine it</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.080" end="00:22:02.159" style="s2">terrifying to you</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.600" end="00:22:03.760" style="s2">most people say no i just i wasn&#39;t there</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.159" end="00:22:07.840" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.760" end="00:22:10.240" style="s2">right so</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.840" end="00:22:12.159" style="s2">you say but it&#39;s the fear of me being</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.240" end="00:22:14.480" style="s2">non-existent not just that well you were</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.159" end="00:22:16.000" style="s2">non-existent before you were born</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.480" end="00:22:17.919" style="s2">so there&#39;s something else mixed up there</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.000" end="00:22:19.280" style="s2">right there&#39;s something else confused in</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.919" end="00:22:22.240" style="s2">the image</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.280" end="00:22:23.919" style="s2">they bring in another one they say well</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.240" end="00:22:26.320" style="s2">your non-existence</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.919" end="00:22:27.919" style="s2">is not something you can ever experience</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.320" end="00:22:31.120" style="s2">epicurus famously said</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.919" end="00:22:31.840" style="s2">where death is i am not where i am death</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.120" end="00:22:34.799" style="s2">is not</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.840" end="00:22:35.840" style="s2">namely if i&#39;m in non-existence i can</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.799" end="00:22:37.760" style="s2">never know it</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.840" end="00:22:39.120" style="s2">it is not something i can ever</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.760" end="00:22:41.520" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.120" end="00:22:43.679" style="s2">so i should never be afraid of it and as</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.520" end="00:22:46.480" style="s2">long as i&#39;m experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.679" end="00:22:49.120" style="s2">that means i still exist and therefore i</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.480" end="00:22:50.559" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be afraid of non-existence</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.120" end="00:22:52.559" style="s2">now you might feel like that&#39;s just sort</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.559" end="00:22:55.600" style="s2">of a logical trick but what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.559" end="00:22:56.080" style="s2">getting you to do is to say what is it</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.600" end="00:22:59.840" style="s2">you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.080" end="00:23:04.559" style="s2">actually imagining</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.840" end="00:23:04.559" style="s2">that&#39;s at the core of your fear of</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.840" end="00:23:13.120" style="s2">non-existence</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.159" end="00:23:13.120" style="s2">now i think what&#39;s happening here</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.240" end="00:23:19.600" style="s2">is that our death is something that is</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.679" end="00:23:22.480" style="s2">mysterious to us</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.600" end="00:23:22.880" style="s2">and i mean precisely that not not in</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.480" end="00:23:25.440" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.880" end="00:23:26.080" style="s2">just something we don&#39;t know a mystery</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.440" end="00:23:27.200" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.080" end="00:23:29.360" style="s2">and that&#39;s the basis of the word</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.200" end="00:23:30.880" style="s2">mystical is something that we cannot</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.360" end="00:23:32.000" style="s2">directly comprehend now we have to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.880" end="00:23:34.559" style="s2">careful</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.000" end="00:23:36.240" style="s2">i can comprehend my non-existence</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.559" end="00:23:39.120" style="s2">propositionally i can say</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.240" end="00:23:41.919" style="s2">i didn&#39;t exist in the year 1888 i won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.120" end="00:23:45.200" style="s2">exist in the year 4054.</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.919" end="00:23:48.720" style="s2">that&#39;s no problem but what i can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.200" end="00:23:48.720" style="s2">is experientially</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.799" end="00:23:52.559" style="s2">i can&#39;t experience even in my</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.120" end="00:23:54.320" style="s2">imagination</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.559" end="00:23:56.799" style="s2">my own non-existence because whenever i</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.320" end="00:23:59.360" style="s2">try to imagine it</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.799" end="00:24:01.679" style="s2">i&#39;m actually there experience it and</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.360" end="00:24:05.279" style="s2">therefore i fall into self-contradiction</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.679" end="00:24:08.000" style="s2">and so there&#39;s something ungraspable</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.279" end="00:24:08.799" style="s2">not conceptually but experientially</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.000" end="00:24:11.279" style="s2">about my</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.799" end="00:24:12.480" style="s2">my own so literally that&#39;s what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.279" end="00:24:14.279" style="s2">proposing to you</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.480" end="00:24:15.840" style="s2">non-existence is something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.279" end="00:24:17.919" style="s2">unimaginable</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.840" end="00:24:19.120" style="s2">and what&#39;s actually happening i suggest</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.919" end="00:24:19.679" style="s2">you this is what the epicureans are</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.120" end="00:24:21.520" style="s2">saying</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.679" end="00:24:22.799" style="s2">is your imagination machinery is</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.520" end="00:24:24.880" style="s2">panicking</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.799" end="00:24:27.039" style="s2">because it can&#39;t predict this because</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.880" end="00:24:30.320" style="s2">it&#39;s not imaginable</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.039" end="00:24:31.120" style="s2">it&#39;s not imaginable and so it turns it</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.320" end="00:24:33.919" style="s2">into an um</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.120" end="00:24:35.200" style="s2">it turns it into some unpredictable</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.919" end="00:24:39.360" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.200" end="00:24:39.360" style="s2">when in fact that&#39;s a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.039" end="00:24:44.480" style="s2">how could we respond to the that</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.120" end="00:24:46.720" style="s2">experience because</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.480" end="00:24:48.799" style="s2">your imagination confronting something</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.720" end="00:24:51.120" style="s2">that is a mystery to it</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.799" end="00:24:52.240" style="s2">something that is actually a black hole</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.120" end="00:24:54.880" style="s2">in your imagination</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.240" end="00:24:55.919" style="s2">oh and this is again where i think</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.880" end="00:25:00.640" style="s2">neoplatonism</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.919" end="00:25:03.600" style="s2">is going to come into play</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.640" end="00:25:05.120" style="s2">we need more practice in the positive</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.600" end="00:25:08.080" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.120" end="00:25:10.400" style="s2">of mystery of that which exceeds our</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.080" end="00:25:12.080" style="s2">imagination which has a no thing-ness to</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.400" end="00:25:15.440" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.080" end="00:25:19.200" style="s2">so the cultivation of awe</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.440" end="00:25:22.480" style="s2">gives us a education of</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.200" end="00:25:23.520" style="s2">right that reduces the panic that our</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.480" end="00:25:25.760" style="s2">imagination</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.520" end="00:25:29.840" style="s2">comes into when it confronts something</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.760" end="00:25:29.840" style="s2">that is mysterious to us</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.440" end="00:25:38.320" style="s2">okay what also happens</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.960" end="00:25:43.760" style="s2">and that&#39;s very helpful here</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.320" end="00:25:47.120" style="s2">is again to remember that continued</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.760" end="00:25:49.679" style="s2">un you know forever immortal existence</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.120" end="00:25:50.240" style="s2">is also horrific and that is something</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.679" end="00:25:52.480" style="s2">you can</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.240" end="00:25:54.480" style="s2">imagine to some degree but when you</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.480" end="00:25:56.320" style="s2">start to extend it towards infinity</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.480" end="00:25:57.919" style="s2">and your imagination starts to block</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.320" end="00:26:00.080" style="s2">everything of value</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.919" end="00:26:01.279" style="s2">because given an infinite amount of time</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.080" end="00:26:02.799" style="s2">you are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.279" end="00:26:04.400" style="s2">go through so many changes that you will</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.799" end="00:26:05.840" style="s2">be completely different</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.400" end="00:26:07.520" style="s2">from the person you are all the</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.840" end="00:26:08.400" style="s2">relationships you have could they</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.520" end="00:26:11.760" style="s2">survive</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.400" end="00:26:14.960" style="s2">all of the time all of infinity</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.760" end="00:26:18.000" style="s2">we are mortal and our meaning is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.960" end="00:26:20.400" style="s2">meaning of mortals</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.000" end="00:26:22.400" style="s2">and uh the line from melville comes to</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.400" end="00:26:24.320" style="s2">me right here from moby dick</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.400" end="00:26:26.400" style="s2">what is man that he should try to seek</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.320" end="00:26:28.880" style="s2">out to live out the lifetime of his god</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.400" end="00:26:30.320" style="s2">right okay so we&#39;re about halfway</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.880" end="00:26:32.000" style="s2">through the four-fold cure</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.320" end="00:26:33.679" style="s2">it sounds like what you&#39;ve got sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.000" end="00:26:35.279" style="s2">one and a half</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.679" end="00:26:36.799" style="s2">on wednesday we&#39;re going to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.279" end="00:26:38.880" style="s2">the fear of dying</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.799" end="00:26:40.080" style="s2">which is not the same thing as the fear</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.880" end="00:26:42.080" style="s2">of non-existence</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.080" end="00:26:43.520" style="s2">the fear of dying is something you can</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.080" end="00:26:44.480" style="s2">experience you can go through the</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.520" end="00:26:47.120" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.480" end="00:26:49.279" style="s2">of loss what i&#39;m going to show you is</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.120" end="00:26:53.360" style="s2">this is precisely the place</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.279" end="00:26:56.400" style="s2">where our imagination runs wild</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.360" end="00:26:57.279" style="s2">and we can address the fear of dying by</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.400" end="00:26:59.120" style="s2">getting</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.279" end="00:27:00.880" style="s2">bringing a better by bringing some of</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.120" end="00:27:01.520" style="s2">the best cognitive science we have to</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.880" end="00:27:05.440" style="s2">bear on</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.520" end="00:27:08.559" style="s2">educating our imagination around</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.440" end="00:27:11.600" style="s2">the future of us dying</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.559" end="00:27:13.279" style="s2">okay and then we will continue on with</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.600" end="00:27:15.200" style="s2">and that will lead us into the two other</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.279" end="00:27:17.600" style="s2">aspects of the four-fold cure</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.200" end="00:27:19.360" style="s2">right your fear of loss of pleasure your</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.600" end="00:27:21.360" style="s2">fear of increase in pain</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.360" end="00:27:22.559" style="s2">and that will actually come out of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.360" end="00:27:25.120" style="s2">fear of dying</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.559" end="00:27:27.679" style="s2">and so we&#39;re halfway through but what</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.120" end="00:27:30.559" style="s2">what you can do right now</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.679" end="00:27:33.039" style="s2">is you can start to catalog the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.559" end="00:27:34.799" style="s2">imaginings you have</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.039" end="00:27:37.279" style="s2">when and the imaginings that are</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.799" end="00:27:40.399" style="s2">bringing about self terrifying</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.279" end="00:27:42.960" style="s2">when there&#39;s imaginings about fate</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.399" end="00:27:44.159" style="s2">think about the capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.960" end="00:27:46.480" style="s2">transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.159" end="00:27:47.679" style="s2">and coming into right relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.480" end="00:27:51.120" style="s2">what is most real</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.679" end="00:27:54.480" style="s2">because that seems to allay that fear</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.120" end="00:27:57.279" style="s2">for the fear of the afterlife</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.480" end="00:27:58.159" style="s2">think about its scientific improbability</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.279" end="00:28:00.080" style="s2">and think about</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.159" end="00:28:01.440" style="s2">well nevertheless you may have a mythic</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.080" end="00:28:02.480" style="s2">and i remember for me that&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.440" end="00:28:04.720" style="s2">insult word</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.480" end="00:28:06.480" style="s2">they have a mythic imagination of it but</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.720" end="00:28:08.799" style="s2">then remember</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.480" end="00:28:09.679" style="s2">that maybe you should extend and more</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.799" end="00:28:12.159" style="s2">fully develop</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.679" end="00:28:14.240" style="s2">with the help of the eastern traditions</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.159" end="00:28:17.120" style="s2">what that mythic imagination</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.240" end="00:28:18.640" style="s2">is really like and do you really want</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.120" end="00:28:22.480" style="s2">that more developed</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.640" end="00:28:24.399" style="s2">imagined afterlife then</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.480" end="00:28:26.080" style="s2">that will actually take you to okay</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.399" end="00:28:28.720" style="s2">what&#39;s actually at work here</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.080" end="00:28:30.320" style="s2">is not the quest for immortality it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.720" end="00:28:31.440" style="s2">the fear of mortality</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.320" end="00:28:32.960" style="s2">and i&#39;m sorry i&#39;m going to leave you</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.440" end="00:28:34.080" style="s2">sort of halfway through and i apologize</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.960" end="00:28:36.399" style="s2">for that</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.080" end="00:28:38.000" style="s2">i can&#39;t teach everything at once and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.399" end="00:28:41.120" style="s2">finite infallible</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.000" end="00:28:41.120" style="s2">and we have limited time</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.760" end="00:28:45.120" style="s2">but you have to break up your fear of</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.120" end="00:28:46.720" style="s2">death into two things the fear of</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.120" end="00:28:50.240" style="s2">non-existence which is</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.720" end="00:28:52.399" style="s2">actually absurd it&#39;s not something</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.240" end="00:28:54.320" style="s2">it&#39;s not what what&#39;s actually happening</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.399" end="00:28:56.799" style="s2">is is not anything you imagine</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.320" end="00:28:58.080" style="s2">it&#39;s your imagination is encountering</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.799" end="00:29:00.000" style="s2">something that is mysterious</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.080" end="00:29:02.320" style="s2">to it something that is ungraspable</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.000" end="00:29:04.640" style="s2">unpredictable and that is panicking</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.320" end="00:29:05.679" style="s2">our brain does not like what it cannot</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.640" end="00:29:07.440" style="s2">predict</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.679" end="00:29:09.440" style="s2">but it&#39;s not unpredictable because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.440" end="00:29:11.919" style="s2">an uncertain event in the future</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.440" end="00:29:14.000" style="s2">that&#39;s a mistake it&#39;s unpredictable</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.919" end="00:29:16.000" style="s2">because our imaginative faculty can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.000" end="00:29:17.440" style="s2">grasp it</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.000" end="00:29:19.120" style="s2">then what do you then what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.440" end="00:29:22.159" style="s2">response then you say to yourself</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.120" end="00:29:24.799" style="s2">i need to get better at confronting</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.159" end="00:29:26.320" style="s2">mystery i need to and we have an</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.799" end="00:29:30.159" style="s2">emotional experience</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.320" end="00:29:31.919" style="s2">ah that allows us to encounter mystery</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.159" end="00:29:33.200" style="s2">in a much more positive and</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.919" end="00:29:34.240" style="s2">transformative</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.200" end="00:29:36.559" style="s2">manner and you&#39;ve already been</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.240" end="00:29:38.799" style="s2">practicing some of that in the eastern</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.559" end="00:29:41.520" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.799" end="00:29:43.679" style="s2">so as i said i&#39;m sorry um to leave it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.520" end="00:29:45.520" style="s2">about halfway through the four-fold cure</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.679" end="00:29:47.919" style="s2">i&#39;ll quickly review this on wednesday</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.520" end="00:29:49.120" style="s2">what we&#39;ve done so far i&#39;ll finish it up</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.919" end="00:29:49.919" style="s2">and did you notice i&#39;m indicating</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.120" end="00:29:52.000" style="s2">throughout that i don&#39;t think the</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.919" end="00:29:53.840" style="s2">epicureans are sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.000" end="00:29:55.360" style="s2">we need more i try to indicate where</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.840" end="00:29:56.960" style="s2">that&#39;s going to come in but i want to</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.360" end="00:29:58.640" style="s2">finish the epicureans</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.960" end="00:30:00.480" style="s2">on the fourfold cure on wednesday and</p>
