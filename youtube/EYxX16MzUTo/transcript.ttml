<p begin="00:19:24.590" end="00:19:29.570" style="s2">that&#39;s both because of them our and</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.870" end="00:19:33.800" style="s2">because of my new schedule these</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.570" end="00:19:36.260" style="s2">teachings of courses the first question</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.800" end="00:19:38.600" style="s2">is from 10,000 things can you recommend</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.260" end="00:19:41.300" style="s2">any good online Tai Chi Chuan channels</p>

<p begin="00:19:41.300" end="00:19:45.260" style="s2">what I want to do is I&#39;ve had a few</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.460" end="00:19:47.000" style="s2">questions about this there&#39;s a few I&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:19:47.000" end="00:19:53.120" style="s2">and then I will come up with some good</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.290" end="00:19:54.260" style="s2">recommendations I don&#39;t want to just do</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.120" end="00:19:57.320" style="s2">it off the top of my head I want to put</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.260" end="00:20:00.380" style="s2">a little bit of reflection into this and</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.320" end="00:20:03.710" style="s2">then I will send that information to</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.380" end="00:20:05.720" style="s2">Amara and I will post it in the notes</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.710" end="00:20:09.020" style="s2">for this video perhaps at some point</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.720" end="00:20:12.440" style="s2">I&#39;ll do a review video observe all</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.020" end="00:20:14.930" style="s2">important information that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.440" end="00:20:16.580" style="s2">sort of collect together in one spot was</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.930" end="00:20:18.260" style="s2">a good question and I will endeavor to</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.580" end="00:20:21.470" style="s2">do that for you guys</p>

<p begin="00:21:05.480" end="00:21:12.290" style="s2">in the practice so what&#39;s tends to</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.840" end="00:21:14.590" style="s2">happen in daydreaming is you you might</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.290" end="00:21:18.530" style="s2">be giving in to sort of you know just</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.590" end="00:21:20.269" style="s2">your reactive emotional feelings and</p>

<p begin="00:21:20.269" end="00:21:23.509" style="s2">some of them might be unpleasant and</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.409" end="00:21:25.519" style="s2">you&#39;re spinning off a narrative and</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.509" end="00:21:27.769" style="s2">that&#39;s very understandable so be</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.519" end="00:21:30.769" style="s2">compassionate with yourself but the</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.769" end="00:21:33.889" style="s2">point is what you need to do is try to</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.769" end="00:21:36.589" style="s2">try to really zero in and magnify and</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.889" end="00:21:39.289" style="s2">amplify what does this what like what is</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.589" end="00:21:42.589" style="s2">it does this feel like not in the in my</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.289" end="00:21:45.950" style="s2">thoughts but in the tempo and texture</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.589" end="00:21:48.309" style="s2">the the tenor and the temperature of my</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.950" end="00:21:52.129" style="s2">mind same thing my body how am i</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.309" end="00:21:55.579" style="s2">inhabited this I identity what world is</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.129" end="00:21:59.079" style="s2">being structured around that person when</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.579" end="00:22:02.570" style="s2">I&#39;m projecting an identity onto them</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.079" end="00:22:04.820" style="s2">that right so that is very much an act</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.570" end="00:22:06.349" style="s2">now you can see it of inquiring</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.820" end="00:22:08.179" style="s2">mindfulness now you don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.349" end="00:22:10.399" style="s2">necessarily go through all the stages</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.179" end="00:22:12.320" style="s2">because I could get too complicated but</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.399" end="00:22:14.719" style="s2">just the the inquiring mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.320" end="00:22:16.579" style="s2">they&#39;ve already started to cultivate and</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.719" end="00:22:18.679" style="s2">you&#39;re already getting an understanding</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.579" end="00:22:21.619" style="s2">of how to apply it you apply that deeply</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.679" end="00:22:25.389" style="s2">as I said into all those T&#39;s of them on</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.619" end="00:22:30.109" style="s2">the temperature the texture the tenor</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.389" end="00:22:33.409" style="s2">the tempo right the body but how are you</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.109" end="00:22:35.959" style="s2">inhabiting mind and body what world are</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.409" end="00:22:39.079" style="s2">you structuring around yourself or sorry</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.959" end="00:22:42.709" style="s2">around that person and yourself as you</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.079" end="00:22:43.219" style="s2">assign an identity to them and how is it</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.709" end="00:22:44.690" style="s2">locked</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.219" end="00:22:46.789" style="s2">how is it trying to sense how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.690" end="00:22:48.859" style="s2">automatic how it&#39;s reactive there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.789" end="00:22:51.229" style="s2">law to be explored there so you have to</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.859" end="00:22:52.639" style="s2">push yourself if you&#39;re daydreaming you</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.229" end="00:22:54.529" style="s2">know what you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.639" end="00:22:56.269" style="s2">you&#39;re letting just automatic narrative</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.529" end="00:22:58.309" style="s2">come up and instead you have to increase</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.269" end="00:23:00.409" style="s2">the demand and we are always trying to</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.309" end="00:23:02.809" style="s2">get right effort increase the demand so</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.409" end="00:23:04.759" style="s2">that you start to get into the flow</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.809" end="00:23:13.279" style="s2">state with respect to exploring the</p>
