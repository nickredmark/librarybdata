<p begin="00:00:28.830" end="00:00:36.630" style="s2">talking before went live I participated</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.650" end="00:00:39.329" style="s2">slash hosted for idea cafes this week on</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.630" end="00:00:41.280" style="s2">communism and Marxism because that was a</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.329" end="00:00:43.040" style="s2">somewhat divisive topic and the group</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.280" end="00:00:44.850" style="s2">were both part of and people were</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.040" end="00:00:47.460" style="s2">seeking like getting their feathers</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.850" end="00:00:50.789" style="s2">ruffled over miscommunication of</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.460" end="00:00:53.699" style="s2">definitions and and how much is Marxism</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.789" end="00:00:55.920" style="s2">ideals and values could be part of a</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.699" end="00:00:57.870" style="s2">game be and some people think not at all</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.920" end="00:01:00.840" style="s2">can&#39;t be other people were like well</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.870" end="00:01:03.809" style="s2">there&#39;s some good stuff here and so I</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.840" end="00:01:06.450" style="s2">set up what was going to be one idea</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.809" end="00:01:07.979" style="s2">cafe and then Jordan hall suggested</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.450" end="00:01:10.890" style="s2">people sign up for them so then a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.979" end="00:01:14.610" style="s2">people signed up for them and it ended</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.890" end="00:01:17.009" style="s2">up being one very popular one which I</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.610" end="00:01:19.350" style="s2">then Slyke shifted people around and got</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.009" end="00:01:22.950" style="s2">it ended up that it was just three of us</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.350" end="00:01:25.170" style="s2">at each of them which is kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.950" end="00:01:26.850" style="s2">perfect number for an idea cafe three or</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.170" end="00:01:29.040" style="s2">four five is a little too many for a</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.850" end="00:01:30.540" style="s2">half an hour conversation two is great I</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.040" end="00:01:33.770" style="s2">mean it&#39;s a conversation but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.540" end="00:01:35.970" style="s2">really an idea cafe and three is</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.770" end="00:01:38.670" style="s2">everyone has up to five minutes to talk</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.970" end="00:01:43.439" style="s2">that&#39;s 15 minutes maximum and then 15</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.670" end="00:01:45.090" style="s2">minutes of dialogue after so I it was</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.439" end="00:01:46.619" style="s2">interesting because I learned a lot I</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.090" end="00:01:47.880" style="s2">mean it wasn&#39;t divisive it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.619" end="00:01:49.790" style="s2">divisive at all it was like well I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.880" end="00:01:51.840" style="s2">know whether it was the group of people</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.790" end="00:01:54.360" style="s2">that they were game be people who were</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.840" end="00:01:57.030" style="s2">practicing the Omega rule or whether it</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.360" end="00:01:59.700" style="s2">was the topic it just so happened that</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.030" end="00:02:00.930" style="s2">most of the people were exactly what I</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.700" end="00:02:02.759" style="s2">was saying they were like there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.930" end="00:02:04.140" style="s2">beauty there&#39;s some good stuff here and</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.759" end="00:02:05.759" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of bad stuff under</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.140" end="00:02:08.220" style="s2">communism Marxism and we want the good</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.759" end="00:02:09.660" style="s2">and not the bad and that&#39;s of course my</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.220" end="00:02:12.180" style="s2">interpretation of what they said but</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.660" end="00:02:13.280" style="s2">there was no division in that there was</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.180" end="00:02:14.930" style="s2">no yes it</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.280" end="00:02:18.200" style="s2">100% right we should be trying to</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.930" end="00:02:21.950" style="s2">instill it nor was it 100% wrong there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.200" end="00:02:24.140" style="s2">nothing of value there it was</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.950" end="00:02:29.240" style="s2">interesting because because of this</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.140" end="00:02:31.040" style="s2">format I had suggested we record it like</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.240" end="00:02:33.050" style="s2">I do with all the idea cafes on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.040" end="00:02:34.400" style="s2">channel and then afterwards we would</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.050" end="00:02:36.310" style="s2">stop recording and we would vote on</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.400" end="00:02:39.230" style="s2">whether or not to make it public and</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.310" end="00:02:41.390" style="s2">everyone voted to make it public but the</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.230" end="00:02:44.200" style="s2">fact that they could vote to delete it</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.390" end="00:02:47.000" style="s2">and they could vote to keep it private</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.200" end="00:02:49.790" style="s2">meant that they were more comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.000" end="00:02:51.440" style="s2">speaking their mind and then after the</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.790" end="00:02:53.989" style="s2">fact the fact that everyone voted to</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.440" end="00:02:55.580" style="s2">make it public was interesting because I</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.989" end="00:02:58.760" style="s2">think that that that gives it a</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.580" end="00:03:02.030" style="s2">different dynamic then it automatically</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.760" end="00:03:03.830" style="s2">been recorded and published or not being</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.030" end="00:03:05.810" style="s2">recorded at all right like it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.830" end="00:03:07.310" style="s2">different it also though even under that</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.810" end="00:03:09.260" style="s2">we kind of generally ended up having a</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.310" end="00:03:11.720" style="s2">bit of a conversation after we stopped</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.260" end="00:03:13.580" style="s2">recording and it&#39;s still a different</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.720" end="00:03:16.130" style="s2">energy and a different dynamic when</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.580" end="00:03:17.150" style="s2">you&#39;re not recording at all then like</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.130" end="00:03:18.230" style="s2">where they know it&#39;s not gonna be on</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.150" end="00:03:19.940" style="s2">YouTube and that&#39;s the difference</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.230" end="00:03:23.000" style="s2">between the idea cafe that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.940" end="00:03:24.799" style="s2">creating the platform and the YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.000" end="00:03:26.480" style="s2">channel is there isn&#39;t kind of an option</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.799" end="00:03:28.700" style="s2">for it to be on the YouTube channel and</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.480" end="00:03:29.959" style="s2">not have people watch it unless it stays</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.700" end="00:03:34.459" style="s2">private but then it&#39;s not really on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.959" end="00:03:36.590" style="s2">YouTube channel versus the platform were</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.459" end="00:03:38.090" style="s2">creating where it can be you have access</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.590" end="00:03:40.549" style="s2">to yours and the people who participated</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.090" end="00:03:42.410" style="s2">have access to it but not the general</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.549" end="00:03:44.239" style="s2">public how about access to it and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.410" end="00:03:46.670" style="s2">people voting and say yes we want people</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.239" end="00:03:48.260" style="s2">to have general access to it so that was</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.670" end="00:03:50.660" style="s2">just a really good learning and I felt</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.260" end="00:03:52.280" style="s2">after the fourth one like I kind of want</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.660" end="00:03:55.790" style="s2">to pick a more divisive topic like I</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.280" end="00:03:57.560" style="s2">want to have like a real one with like I</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.790" end="00:03:59.540" style="s2">don&#39;t say like everyday people but like</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.560" end="00:04:01.070" style="s2">random people that are like this is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.540" end="00:04:03.140" style="s2">divisive topic like what do you think</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.070" end="00:04:05.480" style="s2">about Trump from Trump supporters and</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.140" end="00:04:06.980" style="s2">not and like see see how that works just</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.480" end="00:04:11.410" style="s2">because I wanted to kind of see how</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.980" end="00:04:13.549" style="s2">conflict works in a video type format</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.410" end="00:04:15.170" style="s2">because the questions designed for it</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.549" end="00:04:17.390" style="s2">not necessarily to be divisive but quite</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.170" end="00:04:19.400" style="s2">frankly how do you feel / think about</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.390" end="00:04:22.159" style="s2">Marxism communism isn&#39;t an undivided</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.400" end="00:04:25.280" style="s2">question it&#39;s not really like designed</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.159" end="00:04:27.260" style="s2">in a way to not be confrontational but</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.280" end="00:04:29.930" style="s2">it&#39;s also not do you agree</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.260" end="00:04:31.910" style="s2">with Marxism communism right which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.930" end="00:04:34.760" style="s2">like then we&#39;re kind of starting off on</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.910" end="00:04:35.810" style="s2">a debate instead of right yeah you can</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.760" end="00:04:37.220" style="s2">give your thoughts and I can give my</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.810" end="00:04:40.280" style="s2">thoughts and they don&#39;t have to match up</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.220" end="00:04:44.420" style="s2">but they did you know they did tend to</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.280" end="00:04:46.490" style="s2">find the connections the truth truth</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.420" end="00:04:47.330" style="s2">amongst it so I just want to update you</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.490" end="00:04:48.710" style="s2">on that I don&#39;t want to take too long</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.330" end="00:04:52.670" style="s2">talking about that because we have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.710" end="00:04:54.500" style="s2">agenda or going through but I just</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.670" end="00:04:55.940" style="s2">wanted to let you know I do think that</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.500" end="00:04:57.740" style="s2">maybe you might want to participate in</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.940" end="00:05:00.500" style="s2">an idea cafe at some point so maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.740" end="00:05:02.030" style="s2">can brainstorm what topic you&#39;d really</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.500" end="00:05:03.500" style="s2">like to discuss that&#39;s a big piece of it</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.030" end="00:05:06.290" style="s2">is if it&#39;s something you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.500" end="00:05:08.450" style="s2">talk about it&#39;s not gonna be as</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.290" end="00:05:10.190" style="s2">interesting as yeah I wish I could have</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.450" end="00:05:12.560" style="s2">made one of those I was just wasn&#39;t able</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.190" end="00:05:14.060" style="s2">to but they sounded interesting do you</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.560" end="00:05:19.940" style="s2">know there seem to have been at least</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.060" end="00:05:21.980" style="s2">one person that was very that was seem</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.940" end="00:05:23.360" style="s2">to be very emotional about the topic do</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.980" end="00:05:26.300" style="s2">you know if that was if that person</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.360" end="00:05:29.540" style="s2">participated the other people you happen</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.300" end="00:05:35.330" style="s2">to know she did not did she develop a</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.540" end="00:05:36.920" style="s2">she was kind of and so but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.330" end="00:05:39.320" style="s2">actually looking at doing one together</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.920" end="00:05:40.250" style="s2">next week I kind of offered her any</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.320" end="00:05:41.750" style="s2">gauge she didn&#39;t want to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.250" end="00:05:45.710" style="s2">communism Marx says because it is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.750" end="00:05:48.160" style="s2">hot-button issue for her and so finding</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.710" end="00:05:55.820" style="s2">one that she does want to talk about and</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.160" end="00:05:57.620" style="s2">that&#39;s good yeah sorry continually I was</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.820" end="00:05:59.690" style="s2">just when I posted the four the four</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.620" end="00:06:02.090" style="s2">idea cafes in the game B space and</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.690" end="00:06:05.990" style="s2">Facebook and I also suggested that I</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.090" end="00:06:08.990" style="s2">would like to have a weekly game B idea</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.990" end="00:06:12.010" style="s2">cafe that is just to like explore those</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.990" end="00:06:14.210" style="s2">issues I think that&#39;s the most powerful</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.010" end="00:06:17.360" style="s2">conversations to kind of see what idea</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.210" end="00:06:20.050" style="s2">cafe can be right that is people who</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.360" end="00:06:23.030" style="s2">want to help create a better world</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.050" end="00:06:25.100" style="s2">facilitating conversations and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.030" end="00:06:26.240" style="s2">figuring out what that platform looks</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.100" end="00:06:28.400" style="s2">like to facilitate those conversations</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.240" end="00:06:30.920" style="s2">and they&#39;re just conversations I want to</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.400" end="00:06:32.390" style="s2">be a part of and so if you also want to</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.920" end="00:06:34.820" style="s2">be a part of those conversations maybe</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.390" end="00:06:36.770" style="s2">we can pick another time that isn&#39;t 11</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.820" end="00:06:37.820" style="s2">a.m. on Friday right that works for both</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.770" end="00:06:39.670" style="s2">of us and you don&#39;t have to make</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.820" end="00:06:41.110" style="s2">everyone right but if you&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.670" end="00:06:43.000" style="s2">one every couple weeks and then other</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.110" end="00:06:44.680" style="s2">people know to keep coming to that one I</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.000" end="00:06:46.990" style="s2">don&#39;t know if that appeals to you but we</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.680" end="00:06:49.660" style="s2">can always it&#39;d be good to yeah it&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.990" end="00:06:51.400" style="s2">good to experience it from the inside I</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.660" end="00:06:53.050" style="s2">think that also provides a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.400" end="00:06:55.450" style="s2">insight like you said you thought you</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.050" end="00:07:01.690" style="s2">learned a lot from it</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.450" end="00:07:04.510" style="s2">so yeah yeah do you want to do we this</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.690" end="00:07:07.870" style="s2">first time using the agenda we have we</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.510" end="00:07:09.730" style="s2">have a strip&#39;s by a few things do you</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.870" end="00:07:13.870" style="s2">want to just go by the ones with the</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.730" end="00:07:15.850" style="s2">most asterisks there were two yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.870" end="00:07:16.960" style="s2">just I mean you added someone that I</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.850" end="00:07:18.790" style="s2">think Gutter of you added your own</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.960" end="00:07:20.350" style="s2">Asterix I did and then I added an</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.790" end="00:07:21.610" style="s2">Asterix to one of yours and so yeah we</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.350" end="00:07:24.570" style="s2">have two with asterisks and let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.610" end="00:07:27.340" style="s2">what else we got through I think sure</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.570" end="00:07:29.440" style="s2">yeah so the first one I&#39;d put on there</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.340" end="00:07:32.620" style="s2">discuss where the goals benefits and</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.440" end="00:07:35.530" style="s2">values of ideas cafe and the reason that</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.620" end="00:07:38.260" style="s2">that came up and I&#39;m thinking now it may</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.530" end="00:07:40.780" style="s2">be premature for this but was that I was</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.260" end="00:07:42.610" style="s2">kind of writing down some of the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.780" end="00:07:45.010" style="s2">feature ideas we had and I was realizing</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.610" end="00:07:46.810" style="s2">that the way those features are written</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.010" end="00:07:51.880" style="s2">and implemented will have a lot to do</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.810" end="00:07:53.560" style="s2">with what we want the result to be so I</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.880" end="00:07:55.300" style="s2">want to see if you&#39;ve thought about that</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.560" end="00:07:56.500" style="s2">yet and the other option could be you</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.300" end="00:07:57.940" style="s2">know we&#39;re too early let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.500" end="00:08:00.670" style="s2">experiment with it and let something</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.940" end="00:08:01.870" style="s2">grow out of it so yeah I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.670" end="00:08:03.220" style="s2">little bit of both I don&#39;t know can you</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.870" end="00:08:05.080" style="s2">see people&#39;s comments when they ask</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.220" end="00:08:07.990" style="s2">questions on here could you see it on</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.080" end="00:08:09.520" style="s2">the side the comment Jacob had just</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.990" end="00:08:10.750" style="s2">asked I think it I don&#39;t know if we need</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.520" end="00:08:12.100" style="s2">to talk about it now because we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.750" end="00:08:13.210" style="s2">with the agenda but I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.100" end="00:08:15.280" style="s2">good question of how do you come up with</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.210" end="00:08:17.080" style="s2">or decide on the topics would you accept</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.280" end="00:08:18.730" style="s2">questions from the audience watching and</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.080" end="00:08:20.080" style="s2">yes absolutely not aside from this</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.730" end="00:08:22.450" style="s2">because we&#39;re doing kind of a board</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.080" end="00:08:24.160" style="s2">meeting an agenda from the idea cafe</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.450" end="00:08:27.310" style="s2">absolutely that&#39;s kind of part of it is</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.160" end="00:08:29.050" style="s2">asking what people want to talk about on</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.310" end="00:08:30.880" style="s2">the YouTube channel and then talking</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.050" end="00:08:33.490" style="s2">about it and engaging and eventually on</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.880" end="00:08:34.780" style="s2">the platform that is what I have kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.490" end="00:08:38.860" style="s2">written down here for more of the user</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.780" end="00:08:40.420" style="s2">story of if you want people to be able</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.860" end="00:08:42.690" style="s2">to participate in a way that they want</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.420" end="00:08:45.250" style="s2">that yeah submitting a question and and</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.690" end="00:08:46.690" style="s2">honing a question so it&#39;s less divisive</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.250" end="00:08:49.000" style="s2">and just something that people want to</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.690" end="00:08:50.530" style="s2">talk about and that&#39;s I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.000" end="00:08:51.700" style="s2">have to come up with every question yes</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.530" end="00:08:53.350" style="s2">I would love people to submit questions</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.700" end="00:08:54.910" style="s2">I&#39;d be able to</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.350" end="00:08:56.830" style="s2">both and that&#39;s why we&#39;re playing with</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.910" end="00:08:59.260" style="s2">the tools like for the agenda of how do</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.830" end="00:09:01.660" style="s2">we upload even agenda items that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.260" end="00:09:05.200" style="s2">going to be talking about yeah maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.660" end="00:09:11.160" style="s2">maybe just you so I proposed a couple</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.200" end="00:09:13.660" style="s2">tools there&#39;s a meeting meeting pulse</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.160" end="00:09:15.460" style="s2">where people can anonymously put things</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.660" end="00:09:18.640" style="s2">in and vote things up which you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.460" end="00:09:20.350" style="s2">would have its disadvantages but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.640" end="00:09:23.020" style="s2">one option to use that just for idea</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.350" end="00:09:24.250" style="s2">cafe as well and that that would be a</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.020" end="00:09:26.740" style="s2">quick link that you can just throw</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.250" end="00:09:28.930" style="s2">everywhere and people can that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.740" end="00:09:31.510" style="s2">there&#39;s enough context yeah then they</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.930" end="00:09:33.700" style="s2">can just put ideas in and people can</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.510" end="00:09:35.890" style="s2">vote them up especially for the game be</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.700" end="00:09:39.030" style="s2">idea cafe if we want it to be weekly</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.890" end="00:09:41.860" style="s2">both the time period the time and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.030" end="00:09:44.740" style="s2">question itself let&#39;s yeah it&#39;s thinking</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.860" end="00:09:47.710" style="s2">for the time period there&#39;s also doodle</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.740" end="00:09:49.300" style="s2">doodle comm allows people to put in</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.710" end="00:09:53.350" style="s2">their kind of calendar and availability</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.300" end="00:09:55.090" style="s2">and find the most available time so</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.350" end="00:09:56.650" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s one of the options out</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.090" end="00:09:58.450" style="s2">there I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s easier to do</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.650" end="00:10:01.960" style="s2">that or to just like set out a couple</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.450" end="00:10:05.590" style="s2">times and who can attend is who can the</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.960" end="00:10:07.660" style="s2">first like it was super popular it was</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.590" end="00:10:09.220" style="s2">too popular right once Jordan was like</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.660" end="00:10:11.470" style="s2">yeah people should attend this I was</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.220" end="00:10:13.840" style="s2">like no fifteen people&#39;s too many five</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.470" end="00:10:15.130" style="s2">is the maximum like there was going to</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.840" end="00:10:16.420" style="s2">be one with five and I would have been</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.130" end="00:10:18.160" style="s2">the sixth person and I was just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.420" end="00:10:20.230" style="s2">host it and hope one person kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.160" end="00:10:21.370" style="s2">didn&#39;t show up which and then many of</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.230" end="00:10:25.600" style="s2">them didn&#39;t show up but it was just the</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.370" end="00:10:27.220" style="s2">three of us so that&#39;s part of I guess my</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.600" end="00:10:28.750" style="s2">own internal struggle is like how do you</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.220" end="00:10:31.270" style="s2">put something out there and then also</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.750" end="00:10:34.900" style="s2">limit it like also be like the first</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.270" end="00:10:37.780" style="s2">three or the three that just where my</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.900" end="00:10:40.000" style="s2">need for infinity has to be honed in of</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.780" end="00:10:42.460" style="s2">like do I have the same people again and</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.000" end="00:10:45.490" style="s2">again because that can be its own mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.460" end="00:10:47.470" style="s2">beautiful thing or you didn&#39;t get a</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.490" end="00:10:49.780" style="s2">participate before so someone who hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.470" end="00:10:51.760" style="s2">participated gets priority right and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.780" end="00:10:55.540" style="s2">think there&#39;s both first room for both</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.760" end="00:10:58.090" style="s2">and opening it up to have more more idea</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.540" end="00:10:59.950" style="s2">cafes like yeah so we we definitely need</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.090" end="00:11:01.570" style="s2">to figure out that scheduling thing that</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.950" end="00:11:05.020" style="s2">seems like one of the main features that</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.570" end="00:11:06.400" style="s2">is not well I don&#39;t know like you said</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.020" end="00:11:07.960" style="s2">it could it could</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.400" end="00:11:09.700" style="s2">affect a lot of what the final</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.960" end="00:11:11.770" style="s2">experience is based on that because is</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.700" end="00:11:14.950" style="s2">it is it always trying to get new people</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.770" end="00:11:16.660" style="s2">is it always trying to ask the same</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.950" end="00:11:18.790" style="s2">question in multiple groups like we</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.660" end="00:11:20.470" style="s2">talked about you know if we want these</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.790" end="00:11:22.900" style="s2">ideas to build on each other that it</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.470" end="00:11:26.620" style="s2">almost be useful although it can happen</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.900" end="00:11:28.930" style="s2">if we&#39;re posting videos on on some if</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.620" end="00:11:32.470" style="s2">we&#39;re posting the videos then people can</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.930" end="00:11:34.420" style="s2">build on that on the next meeting if you</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.470" end="00:11:38.020" style="s2">if you want to have that topic happen</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.420" end="00:11:40.180" style="s2">multiple times but it comes down to are</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.020" end="00:11:42.400" style="s2">we are we trying to build up a knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.180" end="00:11:44.590" style="s2">and get a consensus among a community or</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.400" end="00:11:48.090" style="s2">are we just creating a space for people</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.590" end="00:11:51.610" style="s2">to communicate on challenging ideas okay</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.090" end="00:11:53.380" style="s2">so do you have a preference okay but</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.610" end="00:11:55.600" style="s2">which really means the first one right</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.380" end="00:11:57.160" style="s2">to be able to and that&#39;s where with the</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.600" end="00:11:58.900" style="s2">with I don&#39;t remember the exact question</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.160" end="00:12:00.880" style="s2">you asked on the agenda but that discuss</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.900" end="00:12:04.150" style="s2">the goals benefits and values for the</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.880" end="00:12:05.140" style="s2">idea cafe and I wrote like to me values</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.150" end="00:12:06.190" style="s2">that I don&#39;t even think this is Vanessa</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.140" end="00:12:08.680" style="s2">you&#39;re talking I think you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.190" end="00:12:10.360" style="s2">more like the value that the customer /</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.680" end="00:12:12.550" style="s2">user gets right like what is it would</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.360" end="00:12:15.610" style="s2">have been DM and I was kind of answering</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.550" end="00:12:17.530" style="s2">it in terms of like value driven right</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.610" end="00:12:19.240" style="s2">like bringing love in bringing passion</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.530" end="00:12:20.890" style="s2">like values and I was like I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.240" end="00:12:23.050" style="s2">if this is the same question but at any</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.890" end="00:12:24.610" style="s2">rate I said diversity in connection and</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.050" end="00:12:26.800" style="s2">I think both of those things are for</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.610" end="00:12:29.140" style="s2">both like those are the values that I</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.800" end="00:12:31.720" style="s2">want it to instill is the diversity of</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.140" end="00:12:33.490" style="s2">like you don&#39;t need to agree with me to</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.720" end="00:12:35.320" style="s2">attend right we need to be able to have</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.490" end="00:12:42.130" style="s2">a diversity of ways of communicating a</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.320" end="00:12:45.010" style="s2">diversity of I don&#39;t and build into the</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.130" end="00:12:46.860" style="s2">system to to maybe not in the beta but</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.010" end="00:12:50.230" style="s2">build into the system how to keep</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.860" end="00:12:52.540" style="s2">diversity and safety right like how do</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.230" end="00:12:54.520" style="s2">we make sure everyone can use it if they</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.540" end="00:12:56.290" style="s2">want to and yet at the same time people</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.520" end="00:12:58.330" style="s2">who don&#39;t want to be at the same table</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.290" end="00:13:00.970" style="s2">which already happens in the idea cafe</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.330" end="00:13:02.470" style="s2">last week how do I get them separate</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.970" end="00:13:05.470" style="s2">right and then moving people around and</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.470" end="00:13:07.210" style="s2">that was part of usually utilizing the</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.470" end="00:13:12.010" style="s2">tools for both scheduling and</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.210" end="00:13:13.450" style="s2">coordinating like there was the one</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.010" end="00:13:15.420" style="s2">where five people were going to attend</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.450" end="00:13:17.740" style="s2">and two people showed up because</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.420" end="00:13:19.480" style="s2">contacting people on Facebook in a group</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.740" end="00:13:20.250" style="s2">message and I&#39;m not friends with them</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.480" end="00:13:21.780" style="s2">they don&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.250" end="00:13:22.980" style="s2">get it they don&#39;t necessarily know plans</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.780" end="00:13:26.820" style="s2">change there&#39;s no way to communicate</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.980" end="00:13:27.840" style="s2">back and so even having I mean I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.820" end="00:13:29.340" style="s2">want to say the people who didn&#39;t show</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.840" end="00:13:31.020" style="s2">up get it like a mark against them or</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.340" end="00:13:32.430" style="s2">something but at the same time to see</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.020" end="00:13:34.050" style="s2">okay well if you say you&#39;re gonna show</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.430" end="00:13:36.330" style="s2">up repeatedly and you don&#39;t show up</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.050" end="00:13:37.860" style="s2">there&#39;s a problem there especially if</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.330" end="00:13:40.110" style="s2">you&#39;re taking a time spell oh like a</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.860" end="00:13:42.030" style="s2">space spot that somebody else would have</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.110" end="00:13:43.080" style="s2">used right it&#39;s different when there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.030" end="00:13:44.610" style="s2">thousands of people having a</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.080" end="00:13:46.710" style="s2">conversation and a table went from</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.610" end="00:13:48.690" style="s2">having four people to three people not a</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.710" end="00:13:51.240" style="s2">problem but when it&#39;s the YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.690" end="00:13:52.940" style="s2">channel and there&#39;s only so many space</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.240" end="00:13:58.800" style="s2">for people to be able to participate</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.940" end="00:14:00.570" style="s2">that&#39;s a it&#39;s different yeah yeah if</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.800" end="00:14:02.310" style="s2">there&#39;s enough people then it could just</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.570" end="00:14:04.950" style="s2">be who&#39;s ever available and it would</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.310" end="00:14:07.230" style="s2">limit it to four people but we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.950" end="00:14:09.300" style="s2">have to have scheduling mm-hmm I mean</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.230" end="00:14:11.490" style="s2">even when it reaches that mass the</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.300" end="00:14:13.110" style="s2">scheduling would still be helpful like</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.490" end="00:14:14.640" style="s2">if you know you&#39;re gonna be available at</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.110" end="00:14:16.500" style="s2">a certain time yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.640" end="00:14:18.330" style="s2">and I&#39;m down like this one was a little</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.500" end="00:14:19.290" style="s2">too much doing the four doing it on</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.330" end="00:14:21.540" style="s2">something I thought was going to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.290" end="00:14:22.650" style="s2">divisive just yesterday I had two of</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.540" end="00:14:25.680" style="s2">them which is maybe what made me a</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.650" end="00:14:28.140" style="s2">little more exhausted but having three</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.680" end="00:14:29.610" style="s2">maybe even like an hour apart on one day</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.140" end="00:14:33.360" style="s2">which works a little better from even if</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.610" end="00:14:34.589" style="s2">by the end if I&#39;m hosting instead of</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.360" end="00:14:36.120" style="s2">participating I think that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.589" end="00:14:38.700" style="s2">different I don&#39;t need to have my brain</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.120" end="00:14:40.140" style="s2">on as much like I could participate and</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.700" end="00:14:44.070" style="s2">then host another two and have them on</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.140" end="00:14:45.480" style="s2">one day and have it be the same question</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.070" end="00:14:46.830" style="s2">if there&#39;s multiple people who want to</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.480" end="00:14:48.690" style="s2">participate in that game b-type</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.830" end="00:14:50.700" style="s2">conversation right if we have an amazing</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.690" end="00:14:52.500" style="s2">question it starts with like this one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.700" end="00:14:54.900" style="s2">available I don&#39;t know just playing off</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.500" end="00:14:59.810" style="s2">of like what could could be within my</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.900" end="00:15:04.710" style="s2">capacity I know the tool to to build it</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.810" end="00:15:07.770" style="s2">to grow it yeah so let me think through</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.710" end="00:15:10.320" style="s2">this so the we know the scheduling is a</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.770" end="00:15:16.860" style="s2">big feature mm-hmm the feature we</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.320" end="00:15:19.410" style="s2">discussed so if the - if what we want to</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.860" end="00:15:21.540" style="s2">get out of this is is is a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.410" end="00:15:25.950" style="s2">one-time experience that people will</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.540" end="00:15:29.630" style="s2">hopefully grow from then we don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.950" end="00:15:29.630" style="s2">to repeat the questions</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.560" end="00:15:37.090" style="s2">yeah so I&#39;m just kind of analyzing what</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.410" end="00:15:39.160" style="s2">our initial goal is and then we can</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.090" end="00:15:41.080" style="s2">build upon it but it sounds like we</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.160" end="00:15:43.630" style="s2">don&#39;t need to have to roll anything into</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.080" end="00:15:45.850" style="s2">the design immediately that that is</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.630" end="00:15:48.550" style="s2">trying to you know do what we talked</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.850" end="00:15:51.310" style="s2">about before where you&#39;re we&#39;re pulling</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.550" end="00:15:53.920" style="s2">information out of those meetings and in</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.310" end="00:15:58.920" style="s2">building upon that it&#39;s really just if</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.920" end="00:16:01.090" style="s2">we can have people talk and safely about</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.920" end="00:16:03.220" style="s2">interesting or challenging discussions</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.090" end="00:16:05.470" style="s2">then that&#39;s a win mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.220" end="00:16:06.610" style="s2">yeah no absolutely because also I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.470" end="00:16:07.440" style="s2">eventually I kind of have written down</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.610" end="00:16:10.000" style="s2">here somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.440" end="00:16:12.670" style="s2">part of we had top of this last week</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.000" end="00:16:14.410" style="s2">part of creating the idea cafe is to use</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.670" end="00:16:17.230" style="s2">the idea cafe to create all of together</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.410" end="00:16:18.550" style="s2">text projects and so a piece of that is</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.230" end="00:16:20.200" style="s2">once we have the beta once we have</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.550" end="00:16:21.250" style="s2">something that&#39;s very easy to use even</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.200" end="00:16:27.040" style="s2">if the beta it&#39;s just the YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.250" end="00:16:29.410" style="s2">channel and and zoom that the community</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.040" end="00:16:31.150" style="s2">the crowd can help us build that right</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.410" end="00:16:32.800" style="s2">and say what works for them is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.150" end="00:16:34.540" style="s2">Google Doc work does you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.800" end="00:16:36.220" style="s2">mean like what what do we need to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.540" end="00:16:37.720" style="s2">able to for you to understand the</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.220" end="00:16:39.370" style="s2">information that came before what do you</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.720" end="00:16:40.840" style="s2">need to sit here and have built on the</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.370" end="00:16:43.000" style="s2">last questions</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.840" end="00:16:44.680" style="s2">nothing you just want to attend and be</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.000" end="00:16:47.260" style="s2">part of it or do you want kind of you</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.680" end="00:16:49.300" style="s2">know like a broken down version of what</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.260" end="00:16:50.860" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;ve you&#39;ve come to so far my</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.300" end="00:16:52.120" style="s2">guess is both there&#39;s gonna be people</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.860" end="00:16:53.680" style="s2">who want to just show up and have a</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.120" end="00:16:55.150" style="s2">conversation and people who wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.680" end="00:16:57.340" style="s2">both and they might be in opposition</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.150" end="00:16:58.540" style="s2">right you might not want to sit at a</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.340" end="00:16:59.350" style="s2">table with people who don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.540" end="00:17:01.600" style="s2">what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.350" end="00:17:04.840" style="s2">and so there might need to be that how</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.600" end="00:17:06.910" style="s2">do we um orchestrate you know those kind</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.840" end="00:17:08.290" style="s2">of those kind of issues but I like to</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.910" end="00:17:10.690" style="s2">solve problems before they occur and</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.290" end="00:17:13.870" style="s2">that&#39;s not necessarily the best the best</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.690" end="00:17:15.640" style="s2">thing right like if yeah that&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.870" end="00:17:17.800" style="s2">there&#39;s both infinite possibility and</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.640" end="00:17:19.570" style="s2">also yeah like until there&#39;s someone who</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.800" end="00:17:21.100" style="s2">says this is the kind of tool and that</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.570" end="00:17:23.290" style="s2">one that you guys already decided on</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.100" end="00:17:28.480" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work for me we work with what we</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.290" end="00:17:29.890" style="s2">got yeah so I&#39;m thinking though if we</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.480" end="00:17:35.140" style="s2">want to get people interested in</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.890" end="00:17:37.390" style="s2">building idea cafe what we tell them</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.140" end="00:17:39.730" style="s2">we&#39;re building from the beginning is the</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.390" end="00:17:41.830" style="s2">thing that people will be attracted to</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.730" end="00:17:42.850" style="s2">or not attracted to so that will kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.830" end="00:17:45.970" style="s2">bias the people</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.850" end="00:17:47.650" style="s2">being involved so if we say it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.970" end="00:17:49.480" style="s2">it&#39;s an experience</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.650" end="00:17:52.210" style="s2">it&#39;s the singular experience that you</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.480" end="00:17:53.980" style="s2">can repeat and then that would attract</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.210" end="00:17:56.410" style="s2">certain people and have people focus on</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.980" end="00:17:59.230" style="s2">a certain thing if we say it&#39;s a mass</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.410" end="00:18:01.570" style="s2">agreement tool right to build agreement</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.230" end="00:18:04.929" style="s2">or to fight our divisive &#39;no sin our</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.570" end="00:18:06.940" style="s2">society then that would kind of attract</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.929" end="00:18:09.429" style="s2">a separate group of people on the design</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.940" end="00:18:11.980" style="s2">but if we don&#39;t have anything if we say</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.429" end="00:18:14.289" style="s2">this is just a thing if we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.980" end="00:18:15.909" style="s2">specific about that I don&#39;t think it&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.289" end="00:18:17.590" style="s2">attract anybody because people won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.909" end="00:18:20.250" style="s2">have a place in their mind to put it</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.590" end="00:18:25.240" style="s2">mm-hmm so I&#39;m struggling with how to</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.250" end="00:18:28.510" style="s2">describe it in a way that&#39;s attractive</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.240" end="00:18:30.280" style="s2">but isn&#39;t pigeonhole it yeah and I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.510" end="00:18:32.980" style="s2">that that is something that I struggle</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.280" end="00:18:35.110" style="s2">with personally as an individual is like</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.980" end="00:18:38.230" style="s2">creating the elevator pitch creating the</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.110" end="00:18:41.470" style="s2">the thing of like this is what it is and</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.230" end="00:18:43.659" style="s2">so I can brainstorm about it we can kind</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.470" end="00:18:44.919" style="s2">of keep figuring out what what that is</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.659" end="00:18:46.360" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t need to be like it can</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.919" end="00:18:49.960" style="s2">change back and forth from week to week</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.360" end="00:18:51.580" style="s2">until we kind of get to a yes this is it</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.960" end="00:18:53.200" style="s2">right and until it does resonate and we</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.580" end="00:18:55.510" style="s2">do have a group of people then kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.200" end="00:18:57.820" style="s2">almost create it together I have here</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.510" end="00:18:59.590" style="s2">that what I see it being is very much</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.820" end="00:19:03.010" style="s2">this individual piece and the group</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.590" end="00:19:05.200" style="s2">piece that for the individual it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.010" end="00:19:07.240" style="s2">being heard and connecting right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.200" end="00:19:09.580" style="s2">the experience like you said and for the</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.240" end="00:19:11.380" style="s2">group it&#39;s about having an effective</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.580" end="00:19:12.640" style="s2">conversation that is moved forward that</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.380" end="00:19:14.799" style="s2">moves your product you know like that</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.640" end="00:19:16.270" style="s2">and those things are very intertwined</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.799" end="00:19:17.890" style="s2">that of course if you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.270" end="00:19:19.870" style="s2">individuals you don&#39;t have a group but</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.890" end="00:19:22.600" style="s2">also if it&#39;s not enjoyable for the</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.870" end="00:19:24.250" style="s2">individual they&#39;re not going to show up</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.600" end="00:19:27.159" style="s2">again to be part of the group and if the</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.250" end="00:19:28.270" style="s2">group becomes dominant it&#39;s all about</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.159" end="00:19:29.950" style="s2">the group and all about it being</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.270" end="00:19:31.780" style="s2">effective then it&#39;s gonna be pushing</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.950" end="00:19:33.340" style="s2">people out who aren&#39;t having an</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.780" end="00:19:35.320" style="s2">enjoyable experience right if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.340" end="00:19:37.539" style="s2">just there to be seen it heard and</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.320" end="00:19:40.750" style="s2">they&#39;re not part of creating an</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.539" end="00:19:44.830" style="s2">effective you know project together and</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.750" end="00:19:46.299" style="s2">so there&#39;s something about it of like</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.830" end="00:19:48.370" style="s2">it&#39;s showing up and having it for the</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.299" end="00:19:51.040" style="s2">individual with the understanding that</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.370" end="00:19:53.140" style="s2">underlining that is when groups</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.040" end="00:19:56.659" style="s2">naturally form we want to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.140" end="00:19:59.239" style="s2">support that and be able to like</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.659" end="00:20:01.639" style="s2">learn how to guide that process for the</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.239" end="00:20:02.989" style="s2">group right like the same as for the</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.639" end="00:20:05.479" style="s2">individual like how do we make it</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.989" end="00:20:07.220" style="s2">enjoyable and effective for you as an</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.479" end="00:20:09.679" style="s2">individual to participate in and grow as</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.220" end="00:20:10.940" style="s2">a human being awesome that&#39;s all we ever</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.679" end="00:20:13.999" style="s2">accomplish that&#39;s huge</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.940" end="00:20:15.950" style="s2">and then when groups naturally form how</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.999" end="00:20:18.139" style="s2">do we have that same thing exist for</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.950" end="00:20:21.590" style="s2">groups does that make some amount of</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.139" end="00:20:24.609" style="s2">sense yeah so building on that I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.590" end="00:20:27.200" style="s2">though if if you&#39;re gonna have a group</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.609" end="00:20:29.359" style="s2">this type of tool seems to only be</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.200" end="00:20:33.320" style="s2">needed in a group with over like 10</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.359" end="00:20:35.330" style="s2">people over 12 right so it&#39;s when you</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.320" end="00:20:39.019" style="s2">have a large group of people that are</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.330" end="00:20:40.399" style="s2">interested in a goal having them work</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.019" end="00:20:43.309" style="s2">together where they&#39;re not all in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.399" end="00:20:47.929" style="s2">same meeting you know they don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.309" end="00:20:53.149" style="s2">all yeah where everyone has a chance to</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.929" end="00:20:56.179" style="s2">speak yeah and that&#39;s the weird part</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.149" end="00:20:57.859" style="s2">about it being a YouTube channel is</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.179" end="00:21:02.059" style="s2">they&#39;re actually very different things</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.859" end="00:21:04.279" style="s2">right the conversation itself is</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.059" end="00:21:06.440" style="s2">important and about the individual and</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.279" end="00:21:08.119" style="s2">then the group piece is how do you all</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.440" end="00:21:10.519" style="s2">have an effective individual piece and</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.119" end="00:21:14.059" style="s2">have that come together and the platform</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.519" end="00:21:15.649" style="s2">we&#39;re creating I believe focuses on the</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.059" end="00:21:17.659" style="s2">second one because we can do the first</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.649" end="00:21:19.070" style="s2">one just on the YouTube channel like you</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.659" end="00:21:20.570" style="s2">can have just a conversation on</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.070" end="00:21:22.159" style="s2">everything it&#39;s the coordination of</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.570" end="00:21:24.499" style="s2">those conversations that the platform</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.159" end="00:21:25.759" style="s2">will do so no it does both there was</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.499" end="00:21:26.389" style="s2">something other piece there that was</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.759" end="00:21:32.570" style="s2">underlining</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.389" end="00:21:33.649" style="s2">I remember I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll come back so</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.570" end="00:21:35.389" style="s2">what I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.649" end="00:21:40.009" style="s2">with our talking is that&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.389" end="00:21:45.559" style="s2">mass brainstorming tool like you know so</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.009" end="00:21:47.200" style="s2">like large groups can explore a goal or</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.559" end="00:21:49.970" style="s2">a thought space or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.200" end="00:21:53.359" style="s2">together without having to be all</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.970" end="00:21:54.710" style="s2">together at the same time and because</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.359" end="00:21:57.590" style="s2">the conversation doesn&#39;t get effective</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.710" end="00:22:00.499" style="s2">above isn&#39;t effective above for people</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.590" end="00:22:03.139" style="s2">it&#39;s that&#39;s direct communication like</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.499" end="00:22:04.220" style="s2">YouTube or television or something when</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.139" end="00:22:06.019" style="s2">you get above a certain number of people</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.220" end="00:22:07.639" style="s2">it&#39;s not a conversation but this is a</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.019" end="00:22:08.770" style="s2">way to have a lot conversation among a</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.639" end="00:22:11.600" style="s2">large group of people</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.770" end="00:22:12.530" style="s2">that is individual right like because</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.600" end="00:22:13.700" style="s2">I&#39;m in Twitter he&#39;s having a</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.530" end="00:22:15.830" style="s2">conversation with a large group of</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.700" end="00:22:17.750" style="s2">people but it&#39;s not effective it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.830" end="00:22:19.429" style="s2">having that interpersonal I feel like I</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.750" end="00:22:22.370" style="s2">contributed I feel like I was heard and</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.429" end="00:22:24.169" style="s2">having that move the group forward still</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.370" end="00:22:26.059" style="s2">and that&#39;s what the World Cafe does that</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.169" end="00:22:29.299" style="s2">were kind of trying to mimic and I guess</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.059" end="00:22:38.900" style="s2">that was my it keeps almost being there</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.299" end="00:22:41.210" style="s2">and then going away like the</p>

<p begin="00:24:35.990" end="00:24:38.420" style="s2">want three people because one person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.310" end="00:24:40.100" style="s2">maybe not going to show up and then you</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.420" end="00:24:43.880" style="s2">have two people like three to five</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.100" end="00:24:46.070" style="s2">people per timeslot on the platform on</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.880" end="00:24:50.200" style="s2">YouTube that&#39;s what I want per timeslot</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.070" end="00:24:53.420" style="s2">to be an effective an effective host</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.200" end="00:24:55.430" style="s2">once we have that we can use zoom to</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.420" end="00:24:57.050" style="s2">kind of really branch out and have then</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.430" end="00:24:59.030" style="s2">we want more than three then we want a</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.050" end="00:25:01.610" style="s2">minimum of twelve people per time so we</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.030" end="00:25:03.410" style="s2">can actually have a cafe like where</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.610" end="00:25:04.940" style="s2">you&#39;re breaking off into groups and then</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.410" end="00:25:06.500" style="s2">coming back in and breaking off into</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.940" end="00:25:09.340" style="s2">groups and you have them you know half</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.500" end="00:25:12.140" style="s2">an hour but you&#39;re randomly put into a</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.340" end="00:25:13.640" style="s2">three to five person group right to have</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.140" end="00:25:15.560" style="s2">to have a conversation for half an hour</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.640" end="00:25:17.060" style="s2">and then brought back in and then either</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.560" end="00:25:19.400" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole new group of people for</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.060" end="00:25:22.130" style="s2">the next time slot or you can continue</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.400" end="00:25:23.510" style="s2">to be part of it and experience it again</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.130" end="00:25:26.990" style="s2">although when you&#39;re brought back</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.510" end="00:25:28.820" style="s2">together as a main group in those cafes</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.990" end="00:25:30.620" style="s2">is there is there actual</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.820" end="00:25:34.040" style="s2">because what I guess what I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.620" end="00:25:36.790" style="s2">is that we have the benefit of not</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.040" end="00:25:39.980" style="s2">having everyone in one physical location</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.790" end="00:25:42.260" style="s2">so it could be a grouping those</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.980" end="00:25:44.450" style="s2">groupings can happen at any time but</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.260" end="00:25:46.310" style="s2">what&#39;s what&#39;s when the group comes</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.450" end="00:25:48.440" style="s2">together so you have like you know 50</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.310" end="00:25:49.730" style="s2">people in a room after the things is</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.440" end="00:25:51.890" style="s2">there any value that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.730" end="00:25:53.900" style="s2">replicate in the system that happens as</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.890" end="00:25:55.640" style="s2">a group or is that just disseminating</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.900" end="00:25:57.260" style="s2">like if they&#39;re reading off their sheets</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.640" end="00:25:58.700" style="s2">of paper of the things that they did and</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.260" end="00:26:01.280" style="s2">the whole group&#39;s hearing that then</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.700" end="00:26:03.770" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s the whole group watching</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.280" end="00:26:05.390" style="s2">the summary video at the end of someone</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.770" end="00:26:07.610" style="s2">summarizing what they learned or</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.390" end="00:26:09.860" style="s2">something rather than having it all have</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.610" end="00:26:11.240" style="s2">to be scheduled at the same time yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.860" end="00:26:15.260" style="s2">doesn&#39;t necessarily need to be scheduled</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.240" end="00:26:17.060" style="s2">at the same time it&#39;s more if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.260" end="00:26:18.260" style="s2">only four people available no problem</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.060" end="00:26:20.150" style="s2">we&#39;re hosted on YouTube and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.260" end="00:26:21.470" style="s2">growing it we&#39;re playing with it and</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.150" end="00:26:21.950" style="s2">find you know how it works and what</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.470" end="00:26:24.980" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.950" end="00:26:27.380" style="s2">once there&#39;s more people for a specific</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.980" end="00:26:30.170" style="s2">time slot then we go to zoom and do it</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.380" end="00:26:31.370" style="s2">so I guess what I&#39;m it&#39;s more a tool to</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.170" end="00:26:34.790" style="s2">find out where we are</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.370" end="00:26:37.370" style="s2">with the lit minimal amount of my labour</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.790" end="00:26:39.320" style="s2">human labour right to be like it took a</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.370" end="00:26:40.760" style="s2">lot of work to organize the idea cafe</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.320" end="00:26:42.110" style="s2">isn&#39;t be like who&#39;s available when and</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.760" end="00:26:45.500" style="s2">who&#39;s sitting with whom and who&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.110" end="00:26:47.060" style="s2">to be able to say okay well when are you</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.500" end="00:26:49.940" style="s2">available and how do we get you to an</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.060" end="00:26:52.820" style="s2">idea cafe as a user and how do we make</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.940" end="00:26:54.860" style="s2">them so that there&#39;s the table of three</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.820" end="00:26:56.480" style="s2">to five people and when there are</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.860" end="00:26:58.340" style="s2">multiple people who want to be part of</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.480" end="00:27:00.110" style="s2">that time slot how do we effectively</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.340" end="00:27:02.150" style="s2">break you into groups and that&#39;s using</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.110" end="00:27:05.270" style="s2">zoom and not YouTube channel right and</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.150" end="00:27:06.710" style="s2">so I don&#39;t know because I&#39;m not I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.270" end="00:27:09.410" style="s2">know how to what the beta it looks like</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.710" end="00:27:12.710" style="s2">at all of like what that bridge is right</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.410" end="00:27:16.550" style="s2">like what that is the platform right is</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.710" end="00:27:20.660" style="s2">to get individuals just kind of submit</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.550" end="00:27:22.100" style="s2">their schedule to say what when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.660" end="00:27:24.080" style="s2">gonna be available and then have them</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.100" end="00:27:26.060" style="s2">show actually show up right because if I</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.080" end="00:27:27.860" style="s2">say I&#39;m available Monday to Friday 9:00</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.060" end="00:27:29.450" style="s2">to 4:00 I&#39;m not really available Monday</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.860" end="00:27:31.220" style="s2">to Friday 9:00 to 4:00 I want two slots</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.450" end="00:27:32.780" style="s2">during that time period and I want a</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.220" end="00:27:35.960" style="s2">week&#39;s advance notice or I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.780" end="00:27:38.660" style="s2">24-hour advance notice um and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.960" end="00:27:40.790" style="s2">making sure if it does that make sense</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.660" end="00:27:41.960" style="s2">like it&#39;s so although I have my schedule</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.790" end="00:27:43.730" style="s2">when I&#39;m free I don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.960" end="00:27:45.590" style="s2">scheduled for that entire amount of time</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.730" end="00:27:47.180" style="s2">I want to know who I&#39;m talking to and</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.590" end="00:27:48.590" style="s2">then be matched up and then yes it can</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.180" end="00:27:51.560" style="s2">happen all throughout the week and it</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.590" end="00:27:55.850" style="s2">doesn&#39;t need to be everyone&#39;s talking</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.560" end="00:27:57.260" style="s2">all at the same time yeah I&#39;m just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.850" end="00:27:59.420" style="s2">put them on here so I can read them like</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.260" end="00:28:00.710" style="s2">random one slot minutes for the</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.420" end="00:28:02.540" style="s2">participants to ensure everyone is</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.710" end="00:28:03.800" style="s2">listening and paying attention sorry</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.540" end="00:28:06.800" style="s2">honest I don&#39;t know what that means</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.800" end="00:28:08.600" style="s2">I think it&#39;s talking about a larger</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.800" end="00:28:12.110" style="s2">group and tell me if my audio is really</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.600" end="00:28:14.360" style="s2">bad but well you can have an audience of</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.110" end="00:28:16.580" style="s2">fifty people but these five minute slots</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.360" end="00:28:20.270" style="s2">maybe that one person being shown to all</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.580" end="00:28:21.200" style="s2">50 people oh that&#39;s what yeah no no and</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.270" end="00:28:23.540" style="s2">then he said so everyone knows that</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.200" end="00:28:25.880" style="s2">you&#39;re being that they&#39;re listening and</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.540" end="00:28:26.990" style="s2">paying attention so it&#39;s not like that</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.880" end="00:28:28.730" style="s2">would kind of make sense in what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.990" end="00:28:29.870" style="s2">doing right now if we really cared that</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.730" end="00:28:30.950" style="s2">there was an audience of twenty people</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.870" end="00:28:33.020" style="s2">and we care if they were listening to</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.950" end="00:28:34.760" style="s2">paying attention that&#39;s not really a</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.020" end="00:28:35.930" style="s2">problem an idea Cafe because you&#39;re it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.760" end="00:28:38.690" style="s2">like sitting around a coffee table</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.930" end="00:28:39.800" style="s2">having a conversation you can see that</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.690" end="00:28:42.170" style="s2">the people are paying attention or not</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.800" end="00:28:43.460" style="s2">cuz you&#39;re talking to them and there was</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.170" end="00:28:44.880" style="s2">like one of them where I was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.460" end="00:28:46.530" style="s2">find this because there was echo</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.880" end="00:28:48.000" style="s2">and so I was off-screen while I was</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.530" end="00:28:50.370" style="s2">searching around for it and I was still</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.000" end="00:28:53.490" style="s2">listening but I had to verbally say that</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.370" end="00:28:55.970" style="s2">right like it&#39;s a different it&#39;s as in</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.490" end="00:28:57.990" style="s2">person as you can get well it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.970" end="00:29:00.150" style="s2">part of it and if there&#39;s someone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.990" end="00:29:02.280" style="s2">not painted who&#39;s like you know not</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.150" end="00:29:04.200" style="s2">being like interrupting everyone not</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.280" end="00:29:05.340" style="s2">paying attention doing everything but</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.200" end="00:29:06.600" style="s2">paying attention they&#39;re not gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.340" end="00:29:07.680" style="s2">invited you&#39;re not gonna want to sit</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.600" end="00:29:09.330" style="s2">with them again and if there&#39;s a way to</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.680" end="00:29:10.500" style="s2">actually say those things like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.330" end="00:29:10.920" style="s2">want to be matched with this person</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.500" end="00:29:13.590" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.920" end="00:29:17.340" style="s2">yeah that part of the attack that might</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.590" end="00:29:19.740" style="s2">not be beta and Jubilee the the plan so</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.340" end="00:29:21.300" style="s2">the way you did those four is that each</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.740" end="00:29:23.280" style="s2">person had five minutes to talk and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.300" end="00:29:26.910" style="s2">you had fifty 15 minutes of pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.280" end="00:29:28.650" style="s2">unstructured discussion time yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.910" end="00:29:30.570" style="s2">so it is important that everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.650" end="00:29:32.400" style="s2">present at the same time so that you can</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.570" end="00:29:35.520" style="s2">have that structured time after they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.400" end="00:29:37.200" style="s2">fully listened to the other participants</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.520" end="00:29:39.990" style="s2">right that&#39;s an important important part</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.200" end="00:29:41.580" style="s2">oh yes no the three to five people being</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.990" end="00:29:43.830" style="s2">available at the same time for the</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.580" end="00:29:47.730" style="s2">entire conversation that is key that is</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.830" end="00:29:49.410" style="s2">an idea cafe that ours happens at 1 p.m.</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.730" end="00:29:51.690" style="s2">and someone else has happens at 3 p.m.</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.410" end="00:29:53.190" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t necessarily matter but it</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.690" end="00:29:54.270" style="s2">very much matters we were present during</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.190" end="00:29:55.740" style="s2">the same time otherwise it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.270" end="00:29:57.990" style="s2">completely different platform right if</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.740" end="00:29:59.940" style="s2">I&#39;m just putting out my 5 minutes of</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.990" end="00:30:01.860" style="s2">what I think about Marxism communism and</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.940" end="00:30:04.020" style="s2">then other people are listening to that</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.860" end="00:30:06.840" style="s2">and responding that could be a platform</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.020" end="00:30:08.730" style="s2">but it&#39;s not a conversation right then</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.840" end="00:30:10.830" style="s2">I&#39;m looking at you like I look at anyone</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.730" end="00:30:12.510" style="s2">on YouTube and I&#39;m like judging you and</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.830" end="00:30:14.670" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna make this point at this point</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.510" end="00:30:16.950" style="s2">right like we&#39;re not connecting we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.670" end="00:30:20.250" style="s2">not having an actual conversation yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.950" end="00:30:23.510" style="s2">I&#39;m responding to a video let me throw</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.250" end="00:30:27.540" style="s2">an idea out that made me horrible a</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.510" end="00:30:30.840" style="s2">brainstorm is what if we recorded the 5</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.540" end="00:30:33.000" style="s2">minutes beforehand and then part of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.840" end="00:30:34.920" style="s2">process is you could watch that</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.000" end="00:30:38.550" style="s2">beforehand and then you&#39;re scheduled for</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.920" end="00:30:40.650" style="s2">the time to talk together I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.550" end="00:30:42.120" style="s2">if that&#39;s better or worse it would it</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.650" end="00:30:47.280" style="s2">might make the schedule a little easier</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.120" end="00:30:49.650" style="s2">but it also I don&#39;t know I think I like</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.280" end="00:30:51.210" style="s2">it both ways because I think that one</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.650" end="00:30:53.160" style="s2">we&#39;re not using a half an hour but then</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.210" end="00:30:54.810" style="s2">also you&#39;re using 15 minutes like if</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.160" end="00:30:56.910" style="s2">we&#39;re if I know I&#39;m scheduled with you</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.810" end="00:30:57.450" style="s2">and three other people I&#39;m kind of have</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.910" end="00:30:58.850" style="s2">homework</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.450" end="00:31:02.360" style="s2">I&#39;ve listening to those before I should</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.850" end="00:31:04.220" style="s2">up and talked there&#39;s a beauty there</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.360" end="00:31:06.500" style="s2">that I&#39;m recording mine first so I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.220" end="00:31:08.240" style="s2">basing them on what you said right so</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.500" end="00:31:11.659" style="s2">I&#39;m giving you my full unfiltered</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.240" end="00:31:14.210" style="s2">version of my question unpin it which is</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.659" end="00:31:16.519" style="s2">just not quite a conversation but it has</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.210" end="00:31:17.960" style="s2">power in and of itself the issue is then</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.519" end="00:31:20.090" style="s2">are people actually gonna sit there and</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.960" end="00:31:23.059" style="s2">listen to them right or we&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.090" end="00:31:24.889" style="s2">different and so and the other question</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.059" end="00:31:26.240" style="s2">is so then I&#39;m scheduled to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.889" end="00:31:28.789" style="s2">three other people and I sit and listen</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.240" end="00:31:30.440" style="s2">through 15 minutes of listening and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.789" end="00:31:32.690" style="s2">two of them don&#39;t show up and I now have</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.440" end="00:31:34.279" style="s2">two other random people right it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.690" end="00:31:35.659" style="s2">that&#39;s part of it it&#39;s like oh wait I</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.279" end="00:31:37.840" style="s2">listen to the different homework now</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.659" end="00:31:40.340" style="s2">I&#39;ve got to listen to these people talk</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.840" end="00:31:42.230" style="s2">so I don&#39;t know if it would be effective</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.340" end="00:31:44.179" style="s2">with an idea cafe but it&#39;s possibly an</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.230" end="00:31:46.059" style="s2">iteration down the line of like what</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.179" end="00:31:48.409" style="s2">people might want write it to be like</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.059" end="00:31:49.850" style="s2">right and the more because you could</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.409" end="00:31:50.899" style="s2">watch a ton of them be like I want to</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.850" end="00:31:52.490" style="s2">talk to these people I would actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.899" end="00:31:54.200" style="s2">sit you at a table with people that you</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.490" end="00:31:57.200" style="s2">like want to have a conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.200" end="00:31:59.360" style="s2">right and someone who has let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.200" end="00:32:01.639" style="s2">Jordan Hall in the game v-space has tons</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.360" end="00:32:03.529" style="s2">of people who want to talk to him either</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.639" end="00:32:06.379" style="s2">he has his pick of who he wants to talk</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.529" end="00:32:08.149" style="s2">to or it&#39;s randomized for you know what</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.379" end="00:32:09.350" style="s2">I mean he&#39;s he&#39;s picked his people and</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.149" end="00:32:11.659" style="s2">because they&#39;ve picked him he kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.350" end="00:32:12.769" style="s2">has his pick right and the rest of us</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.659" end="00:32:14.929" style="s2">are like yes I want to talk to these</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.769" end="00:32:19.070" style="s2">people in it and it matches us up based</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.929" end="00:32:20.539" style="s2">on I didn&#39;t hate you you know you were</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.070" end="00:32:22.429" style="s2">we were okay with each other like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.539" end="00:32:24.200" style="s2">up voting and down voting right there</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.429" end="00:32:26.690" style="s2">were there weren&#39;t enough people present</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.200" end="00:32:28.549" style="s2">who you up voted so instead you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.690" end="00:32:30.559" style="s2">down vote them right like I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.549" end="00:32:31.879" style="s2">those kind yeah something like that we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.559" end="00:32:38.120" style="s2">have to work out all those different</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.879" end="00:32:40.460" style="s2">yeah things so I see it&#39;s moving forward</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.120" end="00:32:43.759" style="s2">what we need to accomplish is for the</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.460" end="00:32:47.029" style="s2">next steps is to figuring out just the</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.759" end="00:32:49.909" style="s2">feature set for the scheduling that we</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.029" end="00:32:51.679" style="s2">need because everything else I was</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.909" end="00:32:53.570" style="s2">trying to build out too far in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.679" end="00:32:55.429" style="s2">future which is like we said that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.570" end="00:32:56.840" style="s2">of my biases is always trying to design</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.429" end="00:33:00.169" style="s2">way far down we don&#39;t have people</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.840" end="00:33:01.610" style="s2">participating and then like you said we</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.169" end="00:33:03.559" style="s2">need to really kind of figure out the</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.610" end="00:33:08.600" style="s2">pitch the pitch has to be broad enough</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.559" end="00:33:09.950" style="s2">that that it doesn&#39;t pigeonhole anyone</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.600" end="00:33:12.269" style="s2">into what this is going to look like</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.950" end="00:33:14.339" style="s2">which is my big problem</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.269" end="00:33:16.109" style="s2">then but it needs to be specific enough</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.339" end="00:33:18.059" style="s2">that people are interested in it because</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.109" end="00:33:20.849" style="s2">if it&#39;s like oh we&#39;re just solving the</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.059" end="00:33:22.409" style="s2">world&#39;s problems everyone&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.849" end="00:33:26.190" style="s2">like well I&#39;d you know I&#39;m not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.409" end="00:33:28.309" style="s2">find time for that mm-hmm and I yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.190" end="00:33:31.169" style="s2">that&#39;s the question is do we want to</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.309" end="00:33:33.419" style="s2">draw in the people who want to solve the</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.169" end="00:33:34.979" style="s2">world&#39;s problems I kind of do I hate</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.419" end="00:33:37.219" style="s2">like I thought it&#39;s kind of and that</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.979" end="00:33:39.269" style="s2">sort with the user stories I was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.219" end="00:33:40.889" style="s2">after having looked through like the</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.269" end="00:33:42.419" style="s2">inmates running the asylum I was drawn</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.889" end="00:33:45.329" style="s2">to this book which is kind of a bad name</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.419" end="00:33:46.769" style="s2">but it&#39;s called why high tech products</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.329" end="00:33:48.389" style="s2">drive us crazy and how to restore the</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.769" end="00:33:51.059" style="s2">sanity and it talks about of course the</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.389" end="00:33:53.039" style="s2">user user experience and picking someone</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.059" end="00:33:56.249" style="s2">who&#39;s like somewhat a real person and</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.039" end="00:33:57.809" style="s2">and building it for them and sitting</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.249" end="00:33:59.700" style="s2">with that I was like we&#39;re the real</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.809" end="00:34:02.279" style="s2">people were building it for right like</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.700" end="00:34:03.869" style="s2">right now it&#39;s you and I and so yes I</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.279" end="00:34:05.219" style="s2">know we kind of need to think about like</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.869" end="00:34:07.320" style="s2">mythical people that will come on board</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.219" end="00:34:11.010" style="s2">but also we kind of don&#39;t that like what</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.320" end="00:34:12.629" style="s2">we want is I want to help the world you</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.010" end="00:34:13.859" style="s2">want to help the world what what areas</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.629" end="00:34:15.389" style="s2">do we want to help it we both want to</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.859" end="00:34:18.799" style="s2">help it in tech it sounds like but what</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.389" end="00:34:21.419" style="s2">other areas right and then building it</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.799" end="00:34:23.819" style="s2">potentially for two to three like food</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.419" end="00:34:26.639" style="s2">or I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know if that</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.819" end="00:34:28.619" style="s2">appeals but having the people themselves</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.639" end="00:34:30.869" style="s2">saying what they want to work on instead</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.619" end="00:34:32.789" style="s2">of thinking what other people want to</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.869" end="00:34:34.289" style="s2">work on and making a user profile that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.789" end="00:34:35.760" style="s2">the beauty of creating a cooperative and</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.289" end="00:34:38.190" style="s2">having people involved and having to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.760" end="00:34:42.629" style="s2">transparent is we somewhat don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.190" end="00:34:45.119" style="s2">make up mythical people we get real</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.629" end="00:34:47.190" style="s2">people and ask them does this meet your</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.119" end="00:34:52.679" style="s2">needs how is this for you</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.190" end="00:34:56.159" style="s2">what would make it better so I also had</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.679" end="00:34:57.990" style="s2">a thought that it&#39;d be good to get some</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.159" end="00:35:01.260" style="s2">sort of scheduling system but if there</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.990" end="00:35:03.029" style="s2">isn&#39;t if there isn&#39;t something that</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.260" end="00:35:05.849" style="s2">already exists that we can&#39;t kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.029" end="00:35:08.250" style="s2">like hack together to make something</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.849" end="00:35:10.410" style="s2">that works and there might be but</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.250" end="00:35:13.230" style="s2">another option is to hire a virtual</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.410" end="00:35:17.130" style="s2">assistant and just have a real person</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.230" end="00:35:20.760" style="s2">kind of handle that scheduling stuff</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.130" end="00:35:23.710" style="s2">temporarily and see how it works that</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.760" end="00:35:25.840" style="s2">would have a cost of course but yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.710" end="00:35:28.780" style="s2">know even working on systems has a cost</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.840" end="00:35:31.150" style="s2">of time right yeah absolutely and and</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.780" end="00:35:33.400" style="s2">that&#39;s also although we&#39;re not in silly</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.150" end="00:35:35.050" style="s2">there yet if we grow this and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.400" end="00:35:36.850" style="s2">people watching it there can be someone</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.050" end="00:35:38.530" style="s2">who&#39;s like listen I have four hours to</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.850" end="00:35:40.260" style="s2">dedicate to that a week right it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.530" end="00:35:42.220" style="s2">necessarily need to be a paid position</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.260" end="00:35:43.810" style="s2">someone who&#39;s not comfortable being on</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.220" end="00:35:46.090" style="s2">camera but is comfortable to be no</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.810" end="00:35:47.920" style="s2">scheduling piece there&#39;s a piece of it I</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.090" end="00:35:49.210" style="s2">like but I don&#39;t like all of it like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.920" end="00:35:50.680" style="s2">like I kind of liked figure you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.210" end="00:35:52.330" style="s2">like okay this person&#39;s available at</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.680" end="00:35:55.090" style="s2">this point and spreadsheet in it I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.330" end="00:35:56.619" style="s2">like a piece of paper and doing that but</p>

<p begin="00:35:56.619" end="00:36:00.580" style="s2">so it doesn&#39;t really work and just how</p>

<p begin="00:36:06.550" end="00:36:12.460" style="s2">action items that I&#39;m building it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.300" end="00:36:13.330" style="s2">figure out if we could build a</p>

<p begin="00:36:19.090" end="00:36:22.990" style="s2">are out there to build it like you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.340" end="00:36:27.250" style="s2">how can doodle be used how can other</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.990" end="00:36:34.359" style="s2">things views and then just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.250" end="00:36:36.250" style="s2">brainstorm on on the elevator pitch yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.359" end="00:36:38.170" style="s2">I think those are three things that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.250" end="00:36:40.510" style="s2">seeing that that we could probably work</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.170" end="00:36:43.060" style="s2">on yeah we might not get through those</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.510" end="00:36:44.980" style="s2">today we might be sitting with them for</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.060" end="00:36:46.660" style="s2">the agenda next week also I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.980" end="00:36:50.380" style="s2">if you saw just on the agenda</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.660" end="00:36:52.510" style="s2">I had hyperlinks to these so after we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.380" end="00:36:54.430" style="s2">talked about it I made it like each date</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.510" end="00:36:56.710" style="s2">you can go back and watch it if you want</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.430" end="00:36:58.090" style="s2">to so that anyone else going forward</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.710" end="00:36:59.260" style="s2">they come and be the third person if</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.090" end="00:37:00.820" style="s2">they wanted to they could go back and</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.260" end="00:37:03.550" style="s2">watch them right and if not they have</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.820" end="00:37:05.290" style="s2">the UM what we talked about and find out</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.550" end="00:37:06.940" style="s2">what we what we decided the glass we can</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.290" end="00:37:09.369" style="s2">we decided the idea cafes what word is</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.940" end="00:37:11.050" style="s2">our first project and so all along we</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.369" end="00:37:12.910" style="s2">didn&#39;t talk about maybe we should make a</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.050" end="00:37:17.380" style="s2">separate section just for potential</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.910" end="00:37:19.030" style="s2">discussions me aside from agenda like</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.380" end="00:37:20.320" style="s2">meeting well I&#39;m missing like agenda I</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.030" end="00:37:21.760" style="s2">don&#39;t we&#39;re not going to get through a</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.320" end="00:37:23.230" style="s2">ton of this mm-hm</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.760" end="00:37:24.850" style="s2">we have some things on there that I</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.230" end="00:37:28.119" style="s2">suggested that we&#39;re probably not going</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.850" end="00:37:29.900" style="s2">to I think we just copy like anything we</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.119" end="00:37:31.310" style="s2">didn&#39;t finish and</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.900" end="00:37:33.710" style="s2">and shiny but we just mention a tweet</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.310" end="00:37:35.360" style="s2">right and yeah is what I thought how I</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.710" end="00:37:37.370" style="s2">thought it was going to go I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.360" end="00:37:41.360" style="s2">me but there&#39;s some that&#39;s a good idea</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.370" end="00:37:43.040" style="s2">tech stuff but or if there doesn&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.360" end="00:37:45.350" style="s2">to necessarily be in there</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.040" end="00:37:47.990" style="s2">my edition did not even think made sense</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.350" end="00:37:49.820" style="s2">no it&#39;s like rule Omega and quirks I was</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.990" end="00:37:52.790" style="s2">just that was more dealing with the</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.820" end="00:37:56.330" style="s2">individual person that there&#39;s yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.790" end="00:37:58.220" style="s2">anyway I don&#39;t even know we&#39;ll discuss</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.330" end="00:38:00.800" style="s2">that in a future date of like how you</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.220" end="00:38:01.880" style="s2">deal with people who like it in person</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.800" end="00:38:03.740" style="s2">this is kind what I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.880" end="00:38:05.740" style="s2">in person if we&#39;re talking I would tell</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.740" end="00:38:07.790" style="s2">you I&#39;m deaf in one ear so that you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.740" end="00:38:09.470" style="s2">not talk to be on that side I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.790" end="00:38:11.030" style="s2">ignoring you there&#39;s other things that</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.470" end="00:38:13.730" style="s2">happen online and it can be like listen</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.030" end="00:38:17.660" style="s2">I clear my throat so in rolls their eyes</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.730" end="00:38:19.430" style="s2">it&#39;s not acting like and so I did having</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.660" end="00:38:22.190" style="s2">that as a piece of communication so that</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.430" end="00:38:24.140" style="s2">you know this doesn&#39;t mean what it</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.190" end="00:38:25.430" style="s2">usually means in human language right</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.140" end="00:38:26.930" style="s2">and happy not be a piece of it is an</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.430" end="00:38:30.620" style="s2">important piece for me as someone with a</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.930" end="00:38:32.180" style="s2">disability to say hey I have autism I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.620" end="00:38:33.170" style="s2">gonna come off a little different I have</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.180" end="00:38:35.210" style="s2">a TD I&#39;m gonna come off a little</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.170" end="00:38:37.340" style="s2">different and that&#39;s not I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.210" end="00:38:38.810" style="s2">you to gauge it based on based on that</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.340" end="00:38:39.920" style="s2">and I do think that at some point we</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.810" end="00:38:42.140" style="s2">need to talk about that but I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.920" end="00:38:45.620" style="s2">know how to write that out and to put it</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.140" end="00:38:50.540" style="s2">in the agenda besides what I put which I</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.620" end="00:38:52.100" style="s2">think personal quirks Omega which I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.540" end="00:38:56.270" style="s2">trying to abide by more and more just in</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.100" end="00:38:58.430" style="s2">everyday life yeah maybe just to start</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.270" end="00:39:02.930" style="s2">if people have any things that they</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.430" end="00:39:04.520" style="s2">think that they&#39;re aware of that other</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.930" end="00:39:07.430" style="s2">people on the first time meeting on my</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.520" end="00:39:09.500" style="s2">you know to mention that you have any</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.430" end="00:39:11.510" style="s2">effect ations or anything that yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.500" end="00:39:13.040" style="s2">that&#39;s a part of it though is like that</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.510" end="00:39:15.800" style="s2">your pronouns like there&#39;s certain</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.040" end="00:39:17.180" style="s2">things that although I&#39;m comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.800" end="00:39:18.980" style="s2">sharing that I&#39;m deaf with you 30</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.180" end="00:39:21.020" style="s2">seconds into meeting you most people</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.980" end="00:39:23.030" style="s2">aren&#39;t and having almost like a business</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.020" end="00:39:24.290" style="s2">card as part of your profile of like hey</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.030" end="00:39:26.270" style="s2">these are the people you&#39;re talking to</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.290" end="00:39:28.130" style="s2">so you&#39;re not using time every time</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.270" end="00:39:30.200" style="s2">you&#39;re like one because then you can</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.130" end="00:39:32.390" style="s2">mismatch with people that aren&#39;t part of</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.200" end="00:39:34.070" style="s2">the quirks right like if me clearing my</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.390" end="00:39:35.120" style="s2">throat is gonna really annoy someone we</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.070" end="00:39:38.780" style="s2">probably shouldn&#39;t be matched up</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.120" end="00:39:42.020" style="s2">together if someone has you know ticks</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.780" end="00:39:43.700" style="s2">and Tourette&#39;s and and like making sure</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.020" end="00:39:45.500" style="s2">that not only do you not want to take</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.700" end="00:39:47.150" style="s2">the time every time to explain that and</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.500" end="00:39:48.950" style="s2">the vulnerability every time to explain</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.150" end="00:39:50.690" style="s2">that but it also means whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.950" end="00:39:52.849" style="s2">we&#39;re compatible or not right to have it</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.690" end="00:39:54.440" style="s2">to have a conversation because none of</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.849" end="00:39:56.660" style="s2">those things make us go to bad people</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.440" end="00:39:59.510" style="s2">right like I clear my throat or that you</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.660" end="00:40:00.859" style="s2">get annoyed by it isn&#39;t it&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.510" end="00:40:03.200" style="s2">relevant that we don&#39;t want it to</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.859" end="00:40:04.849" style="s2">detract from the conversation and so to</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.200" end="00:40:07.190" style="s2">have that be a piece of like user</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.849" end="00:40:08.780" style="s2">profiles again we might not be able to</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.190" end="00:40:12.910" style="s2">match people in the beta based on that</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.780" end="00:40:15.349" style="s2">but later on with more money more</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.910" end="00:40:17.510" style="s2">project power more you know people who</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.349" end="00:40:19.130" style="s2">know how to code those kind of things we</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.510" end="00:40:21.140" style="s2">have more and more ways of doing that</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.130" end="00:40:23.570" style="s2">and honor you know that it was that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.140" end="00:40:26.510" style="s2">part of the diversity of values the</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.570" end="00:40:27.920" style="s2">values and diversity is like how do you</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.510" end="00:40:31.450" style="s2">match people up without making anyone</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.920" end="00:40:33.500" style="s2">wrong so that they can connect further</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.450" end="00:40:34.970" style="s2">right so they&#39;re not sitting there with</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.500" end="00:40:39.589" style="s2">those triggers that don&#39;t need to be</p>

<p begin="00:44:02.560" end="00:44:05.350" style="s2">kind of in there and then it was like</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.820" end="00:44:07.000" style="s2">right they get that right you don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.350" end="00:44:09.130" style="s2">to put on Twitter that it&#39;s like their</p>

<p begin="00:44:16.600" end="00:44:19.780" style="s2">that would be like the full mission</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.770" end="00:44:21.070" style="s2">statement but just a tagline or slogan</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.780" end="00:44:25.090" style="s2">it&#39;ll be something like meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.070" end="00:44:28.290" style="s2">conversations that generate solutions or</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.090" end="00:44:30.609" style="s2">I&#39;m wondering meaningful is useful but</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.290" end="00:44:34.330" style="s2">one of the interesting things about this</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.609" end="00:44:37.420" style="s2">is that so I don&#39;t know if word like</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.330" end="00:44:40.000" style="s2">intimate might even work because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.420" end="00:44:46.359" style="s2">taking the extra energy to put everyone</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.000" end="00:44:48.190" style="s2">on video together at the same time so</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.359" end="00:44:50.109" style="s2">that&#39;s where people come for intimate</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.190" end="00:44:52.690" style="s2">conversations and generate solutions</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.109" end="00:44:54.460" style="s2">together or just where people come for</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.690" end="00:44:56.380" style="s2">intimate conversations is kind of what</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.460" end="00:44:58.450" style="s2">we&#39;re that is kind of what I do at cafe</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.380" end="00:45:00.100" style="s2">that YouTube channel is mmhmm right</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.450" end="00:45:02.050" style="s2">because we&#39;re not generating solutions</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.100" end="00:45:05.020" style="s2">together it&#39;s like how do you guys all</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.050" end="00:45:06.609" style="s2">help me deal with my like my need for</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.020" end="00:45:08.710" style="s2">conversation and to create this platform</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.609" end="00:45:11.230" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of what without saying that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.710" end="00:45:12.820" style="s2">what it is like it&#39;s what conversations</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.230" end="00:45:14.770" style="s2">do I want to be a part of and host and</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.820" end="00:45:16.420" style="s2">I&#39;m totally open to whatever</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.770" end="00:45:18.340" style="s2">conversations other people want to be a</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.420" end="00:45:20.619" style="s2">part of but I&#39;ve never hosting one on</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.340" end="00:45:22.810" style="s2">sports like it&#39;s just not right so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.619" end="00:45:24.130" style="s2">I want to do is somebody else like once</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.810" end="00:45:25.930" style="s2">we have the platform and someone else</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.130" end="00:45:26.950" style="s2">wants to show up I would never tell</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.930" end="00:45:33.520" style="s2">anyone else they can&#39;t have that</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.950" end="00:45:35.290" style="s2">conversation but yes and that&#39;s good I</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.520" end="00:45:37.330" style="s2">think I&#39;ll think more about that in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.290" end="00:45:39.820" style="s2">coming weekend all right maybe we can</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.330" end="00:45:41.980" style="s2">have a couple ideas to review for next</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.820" end="00:45:43.960" style="s2">all right and the schedule requirements</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.980" end="00:45:45.700" style="s2">I can also kind of sit and brainstorm as</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.960" end="00:45:49.210" style="s2">far as like I don&#39;t necessarily know the</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.700" end="00:45:50.890" style="s2">language around it but I have sat with</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.210" end="00:45:52.090" style="s2">like this is what as an individual I</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.890" end="00:45:53.770" style="s2">want it to do right like this is what I</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.090" end="00:45:55.000" style="s2">want my dashboard to kind of have</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.770" end="00:45:57.160" style="s2">like I want to be able to say my</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.000" end="00:45:59.350" style="s2">schedule and have it match me with</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.160" end="00:46:00.970" style="s2">people and tell me how does it tell me</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.350" end="00:46:04.180" style="s2">right it needs to have an alert that</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.970" end="00:46:08.380" style="s2">says yes you&#39;re talking at 2:00 p.m. on</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.180" end="00:46:10.480" style="s2">Tuesday two people confirm needs to have</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.380" end="00:46:12.130" style="s2">that confirmation piece so that yes oh</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.480" end="00:46:15.720" style="s2">turns out no I was available all week</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.130" end="00:46:18.670" style="s2">and then things got nope not available</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.720" end="00:46:22.390" style="s2">yeah I would be perfect so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.670" end="00:46:24.850" style="s2">yeah any any any requirements that you</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.390" end="00:46:26.770" style="s2">can think of all right sounds good do</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.850" end="00:46:27.940" style="s2">you want to I know it wasn&#39;t really on</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.770" end="00:46:30.610" style="s2">the agenda today but I think those are</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.940" end="00:46:32.470" style="s2">kind of the action items as far as we</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.610" end="00:46:37.030" style="s2">could talk through that more here or we</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.470" end="00:46:39.670" style="s2">could um the spreadsheet for tech that</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.030" end="00:46:41.380" style="s2">exists to have the the columns I know we</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.670" end="00:46:43.060" style="s2">didn&#39;t asterisk next to those ones but</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.380" end="00:46:44.680" style="s2">it used to had said you had some ideas</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.060" end="00:46:46.960" style="s2">of what I just kind of threw up what</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.680" end="00:46:48.730" style="s2">what works because I keep coming into</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.960" end="00:46:50.080" style="s2">contact with new tech and then I want to</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.730" end="00:46:53.170" style="s2">put it somewhere so I don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.080" end="00:46:57.120" style="s2">constantly keep them straight or have</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.170" end="00:47:00.340" style="s2">them be told about again and again and I</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.120" end="00:47:02.830" style="s2">think it helps if and when one of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.340" end="00:47:06.460" style="s2">projects is the app for ideas too or</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.830" end="00:47:07.690" style="s2">sorry the app for tech Yelp for apps be</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.460" end="00:47:09.790" style="s2">able to say these ones are what already</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.690" end="00:47:12.070" style="s2">exists this is already within that that</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.790" end="00:47:13.390" style="s2">realm of and I liked your idea of not</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.070" end="00:47:15.810" style="s2">having the tabs along the bottom and</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.390" end="00:47:19.750" style="s2">have you notes own column of like that</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.810" end="00:47:23.350" style="s2">yeah Kory a category of what it what it</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.750" end="00:47:24.820" style="s2">solves yeah so I was also wondering I</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.350" end="00:47:28.330" style="s2">was thinking through this like some of</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.820" end="00:47:30.700" style="s2">them are tools that we just would use to</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.330" end="00:47:35.050" style="s2">get to game B but they wouldn&#39;t they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.700" end="00:47:37.600" style="s2">not necessarily a tool designed some of</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.050" end="00:47:39.190" style="s2">them we would be using because we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.600" end="00:47:45.850" style="s2">have time to build a whole tool but</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.190" end="00:47:47.710" style="s2">they&#39;re very kind of anti game be like</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.850" end="00:47:49.000" style="s2">to have a discussion on you know and and</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.710" end="00:47:50.860" style="s2">maybe there&#39;s some stuff out there that</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.000" end="00:47:53.920" style="s2">it&#39;s like this was game B before we knew</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.860" end="00:47:56.050" style="s2">a game he was right so it&#39;d be nice to</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.920" end="00:47:58.540" style="s2">have some something that says like how</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.050" end="00:48:00.310" style="s2">game B ish it is or of course we</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.540" end="00:48:03.580" style="s2">probably don&#39;t know enough about game B</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.310" end="00:48:06.400" style="s2">to do that yet yeah but something that</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.580" end="00:48:07.540" style="s2">had some of the values a game be like</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.400" end="00:48:12.430" style="s2">you know is it for profit</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.540" end="00:48:14.470" style="s2">and all the stuff is it I think without</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.430" end="00:48:16.510" style="s2">it necessarily saying game be checkmark</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.470" end="00:48:18.670" style="s2">not checkmark or you know score out of</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.510" end="00:48:19.600" style="s2">10 who oh that&#39;s where I was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.670" end="00:48:21.250" style="s2">like I&#39;m like I don&#39;t even know how to</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.600" end="00:48:23.050" style="s2">tell who owns it but like is it owns</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.250" end="00:48:24.910" style="s2">right is it owned on the stock market is</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.050" end="00:48:26.800" style="s2">it owned by ten people is it owned is it</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.910" end="00:48:28.060" style="s2">like Wikipedia is a not-for-profit but</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.800" end="00:48:29.710" style="s2">it&#39;s still owned by specific group of</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.060" end="00:48:31.900" style="s2">people right it&#39;s not owned by humanity</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.710" end="00:48:33.070" style="s2">but nothing is owned by humanity that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.900" end="00:48:34.120" style="s2">why we&#39;re creating the one that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.070" end="00:48:37.240" style="s2">of owned by humanity</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.120" end="00:48:39.310" style="s2">yeah but there are ones like the holo</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.240" end="00:48:41.290" style="s2">chain and stuff that again they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.310" end="00:48:43.030" style="s2">like who owns it who&#39;s actually in</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.290" end="00:48:44.890" style="s2">charge of this but the idea is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.030" end="00:48:48.480" style="s2">decentralized and you can add on to it I</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.890" end="00:48:50.950" style="s2">don&#39;t even understand it necessarily but</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.480" end="00:48:52.150" style="s2">business structure like how what is the</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.950" end="00:48:54.040" style="s2">business structure of it what is the</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.150" end="00:48:55.780" style="s2">corporate structure of it how do they</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.040" end="00:49:00.040" style="s2">make their money and that&#39;s not an easy</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.780" end="00:49:01.870" style="s2">column right what is there like this is</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.040" end="00:49:03.580" style="s2">unclear so they clearly make their money</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.870" end="00:49:05.080" style="s2">from somewhere is a very important piece</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.580" end="00:49:07.540" style="s2">Wikipedia is like they make them from</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.080" end="00:49:09.840" style="s2">donations right then a lot of Em&#39;s ad</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.540" end="00:49:12.760" style="s2">revenue or whatever it happens to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.840" end="00:49:14.290" style="s2">like what are the important pieces cuz</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.760" end="00:49:16.630" style="s2">we don&#39;t need to fill them all out right</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.290" end="00:49:19.060" style="s2">if I hear of next door I can just put</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.630" end="00:49:20.950" style="s2">that in put a URL to it and someone else</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.060" end="00:49:22.600" style="s2">could fill that out eventually but we</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.950" end="00:49:24.820" style="s2">want to be able to have columns for the</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.600" end="00:49:26.670" style="s2">things that we care about so that if</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.820" end="00:49:28.930" style="s2">they&#39;re part of it that would be</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.670" end="00:49:33.790" style="s2">especially for people who have projects</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.930" end="00:49:36.270" style="s2">in game B right who like Jonelle who has</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.790" end="00:49:39.730" style="s2">I can never remember the name of it her</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.270" end="00:49:41.620" style="s2">plat for that she&#39;s creating that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.730" end="00:49:43.480" style="s2">I&#39;m not gonna it is but she&#39;s constantly</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.620" end="00:49:44.470" style="s2">adding things to it and having it be</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.480" end="00:49:45.640" style="s2">like what&#39;s your tagline</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.470" end="00:49:46.870" style="s2">what&#39;s your elevator pitch she or</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.640" end="00:49:48.430" style="s2">Janelle you&#39;re the one you know I mean</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.870" end="00:49:50.530" style="s2">who&#39;s kind of in charge of it and what</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.430" end="00:49:51.670" style="s2">is it hope to accomplish and what like</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.530" end="00:49:53.200" style="s2">there&#39;s ones that will be able to fill</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.670" end="00:49:55.840" style="s2">out better because we know the people</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.200" end="00:49:57.460" style="s2">creating them and then ones that we</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.840" end="00:50:00.040" style="s2">don&#39;t but that&#39;s part of the lack of</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.460" end="00:50:03.610" style="s2">transparency in there in the tech space</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.040" end="00:50:05.410" style="s2">and online of how do you trust who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.610" end="00:50:06.910" style="s2">making it how&#39;d people trust your notes</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.410" end="00:50:08.140" style="s2">and they don&#39;t know her right yeah like</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.910" end="00:50:10.840" style="s2">we&#39;ll want to fly and say these are</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.140" end="00:50:13.810" style="s2">these are tools from within the</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.840" end="00:50:16.590" style="s2">community itself well within the game be</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.810" end="00:50:19.590" style="s2">community or the idea cafe community or</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.590" end="00:50:19.590" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.290" end="00:50:24.500" style="s2">you can do because part of what I would</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.490" end="00:50:26.780" style="s2">love to do with them one of our projects</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.500" end="00:50:28.970" style="s2">at one point in time is those Maps of</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.780" end="00:50:30.830" style="s2">like who owns what right like how much</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.970" end="00:50:33.080" style="s2">food is Nestle owned how many companies</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.830" end="00:50:34.870" style="s2">is Nestle owned I think it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.080" end="00:50:36.710" style="s2">to have that internally as well like</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.870" end="00:50:39.770" style="s2">transparently so everyone can see it but</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.710" end="00:50:41.480" style="s2">like hey how we know each other&#39;s from</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.770" end="00:50:43.400" style="s2">the game bSpace right how someone else</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.480" end="00:50:45.350" style="s2">might come on board is I don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.400" end="00:50:46.550" style="s2">met them at my kids school right like to</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.350" end="00:50:48.950" style="s2">be able to see a how do these people</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.550" end="00:50:50.690" style="s2">actually come on board and be part of it</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.950" end="00:50:52.820" style="s2">more so with like my brother we meet</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.690" end="00:50:53.630" style="s2">tomorrow we&#39;re siblings like you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.820" end="00:50:55.280" style="s2">we&#39;ve known each other our whole lives</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.630" end="00:50:56.690" style="s2">that&#39;s an important piece if we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.280" end="00:50:59.660" style="s2">putting our last names on the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.690" end="00:51:02.180" style="s2">right like yeah both this dynamic is a</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.660" end="00:51:05.300" style="s2">sibling dynamic and also like of a third</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.180" end="00:51:06.860" style="s2">persons coming on board and also people</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.300" end="00:51:08.420" style="s2">just understand that that I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.860" end="00:51:10.370" style="s2">trust him more than I&#39;m gonna trust some</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.420" end="00:51:12.380" style="s2">other random person that I&#39;m probably</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.370" end="00:51:12.830" style="s2">gonna support his ideas and tear them</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.380" end="00:51:21.410" style="s2">apart</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.830" end="00:51:23.590" style="s2">that&#39;s what siblings are for yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.410" end="00:51:27.380" style="s2">that&#39;s all I was thinking of columns was</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.590" end="00:51:29.900" style="s2">what you know something to kind of say</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.380" end="00:51:32.420" style="s2">are these just tools were using or which</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.900" end="00:51:36.410" style="s2">might be in the in that category like</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.420" end="00:51:37.460" style="s2">you said oh must be the connection</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.410" end="00:51:39.320" style="s2">problem that&#39;s never happened on here</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.460" end="00:51:41.480" style="s2">before oh did I lose you for a minute</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.320" end="00:51:45.040" style="s2">yeah yeah we both went there was like</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.480" end="00:51:49.700" style="s2">little a little spinning thing on there</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.040" end="00:51:51.020" style="s2">and say like if Elon Musk&#39;s cuz these</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.700" end="00:51:52.640" style="s2">who comes to mind</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.020" end="00:51:54.230" style="s2">everyone kind of who has so maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.640" end="00:51:55.160" style="s2">don&#39;t need it on him but anyone else who</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.230" end="00:51:57.290" style="s2">creates something what were your</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.160" end="00:51:58.910" style="s2">previous projects right like stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.290" end="00:51:59.840" style="s2">tracks the person but now I&#39;m getting on</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.910" end="00:52:02.630" style="s2">to a whole new project that we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.840" end="00:52:04.430" style="s2">doing so I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.630" end="00:52:06.140" style="s2">just jump and create that but like those</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.430" end="00:52:07.910" style="s2">are pieces of it right if we know that</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.140" end="00:52:10.070" style="s2">these five people are founding members</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.910" end="00:52:11.720" style="s2">and they happen to have also been</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.070" end="00:52:13.700" style="s2">founding members on these other ones I</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.720" end="00:52:16.640" style="s2">think that&#39;s like just a part of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.700" end="00:52:20.810" style="s2">column be able to find people but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.640" end="00:52:24.320" style="s2">hard to do on a spreadsheet I think yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.810" end="00:52:25.760" style="s2">so I&#39;m wondering like a column just to</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.320" end="00:52:28.460" style="s2">indicate whether or not they&#39;re from</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.760" end="00:52:33.250" style="s2">this these communities and then maybe</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.460" end="00:52:33.250" style="s2">one for you know are they</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.590" end="00:52:37.610" style="s2">yeah and then like you know what what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.270" end="00:52:41.780" style="s2">there this is it you know like you have</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.610" end="00:52:43.850" style="s2">for profit is one of the things and for</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.780" end="00:52:44.930" style="s2">profit not-for-profit cooperative I</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.850" end="00:52:48.620" style="s2">don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.930" end="00:52:49.850" style="s2">HM blockchain which even blockchain can</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.620" end="00:52:51.650" style="s2">be any of those other three like</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.850" end="00:52:53.630" style="s2">blockchain has to kind of be there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.650" end="00:52:56.120" style="s2">like a legal corporate structure what is</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.630" end="00:52:58.730" style="s2">it but I don&#39;t know how to find that out</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.120" end="00:53:02.200" style="s2">for a website but it exists like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.730" end="00:53:05.000" style="s2">somewhere online and that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.200" end="00:53:07.190" style="s2">making information that&#39;s already exists</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.000" end="00:53:10.610" style="s2">and is out there but usable right</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.190" end="00:53:12.980" style="s2">creating and the spread she doesn&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.610" end="00:53:14.840" style="s2">to do all of that but to be able to have</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.980" end="00:53:16.550" style="s2">that call and just even own that like</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.840" end="00:53:17.930" style="s2">this is a piece of information that</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.550" end="00:53:20.000" style="s2">would be great to have even if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.930" end="00:53:23.500" style="s2">have it we might have it for one in ten</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.000" end="00:53:26.380" style="s2">of them or one in a hundred of them but</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.500" end="00:53:29.750" style="s2">we decide on do we decide on columns</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.380" end="00:53:30.380" style="s2">like well we definitely add a category</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.750" end="00:53:36.050" style="s2">column</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.380" end="00:53:37.970" style="s2">okay so category name which can have the</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.050" end="00:53:39.470" style="s2">URL right there it&#39;s just easier and</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.970" end="00:53:41.420" style="s2">that&#39;s also what I did I don&#39;t know on</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.470" end="00:53:43.280" style="s2">which one oh and the pricing structure</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.420" end="00:53:45.290" style="s2">because there&#39;s pricing which i think is</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.280" end="00:53:46.700" style="s2">an important feature but you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.290" end="00:53:48.800" style="s2">really include that in the spreadsheet</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.700" end="00:53:52.040" style="s2">so just linking to it back to their</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.800" end="00:53:54.200" style="s2">their pricing on theirs right or free</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.040" end="00:53:55.640" style="s2">because that&#39;s a really easy pricing</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.200" end="00:53:58.310" style="s2">structure to put on there right like</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.640" end="00:54:01.070" style="s2">Wikipedia is free you don&#39;t need to pay</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.310" end="00:54:03.230" style="s2">for it and those are important factors I</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.070" end="00:54:05.270" style="s2">think I just put like I don&#39;t know which</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.230" end="00:54:07.070" style="s2">one it was for but I put free - like 60</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.270" end="00:54:09.110" style="s2">bucks a month per user and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.070" end="00:54:11.330" style="s2">it is but then I linked back to the to</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.110" end="00:54:13.550" style="s2">the pricing structure it was pricing</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.330" end="00:54:19.640" style="s2">pricing but I also feel like beyond just</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.550" end="00:54:21.200" style="s2">the pricing model like they they&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.640" end="00:54:23.690" style="s2">subscription base that they charge</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.200" end="00:54:25.220" style="s2">monthly that like there&#39;s to me at least</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.690" end="00:54:27.290" style="s2">as a consumer a big difference between I</p>

<p begin="00:59:47.830" end="00:59:54.220" style="s2">Ernesto seen sort of me space automation</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.490" end="00:59:55.750" style="s2">it what we&#39;re specifically referring to</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.220" end="00:59:58.060" style="s2">are all they would all be tech based I</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.750" end="00:59:59.200" style="s2">know I said Tesla but that just comes</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.060" end="01:00:00.760" style="s2">out somewhat I know you love mollusk I</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.200" end="01:00:03.160" style="s2">know he also has apps and other stuff I</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.760" end="01:00:06.670" style="s2">just don&#39;t know what they are but these</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.160" end="01:00:09.430" style="s2">are all about apps websites technology</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.670" end="01:00:11.080" style="s2">specifically because that&#39;s what people</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.430" end="01:00:12.940" style="s2">keep saying hey have you heard of this</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.080" end="01:00:14.260" style="s2">this already exists and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.940" end="01:00:15.580" style="s2">nowhere to put it besides in my head</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.260" end="01:00:18.670" style="s2">where it&#39;s gonna go out because it&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.580" end="01:00:21.160" style="s2">because of my memory so yeah as category</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.670" end="01:00:23.320" style="s2">references yeah those are important but</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.160" end="01:00:25.080" style="s2">also I don&#39;t know how to I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.320" end="01:00:27.490" style="s2">the ability to do that on a spreadsheet</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.080" end="01:00:28.840" style="s2">yeah I don&#39;t know if we want to spend</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.490" end="01:00:32.650" style="s2">that much time maintaining that level</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.840" end="01:00:33.730" style="s2">detail no it&#39;s just it this is why we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.650" end="01:00:36.550" style="s2">probably ready you know take it too much</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.730" end="01:00:38.140" style="s2">time talking about it but having the</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.550" end="01:00:40.120" style="s2">bare minimum of columns that like we can</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.140" end="01:00:42.250" style="s2">kind of fill out as we find one as we</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.120" end="01:00:43.660" style="s2">meet people who are part of their own</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.250" end="01:00:44.830" style="s2">tech like even if they&#39;re coming on</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.660" end="01:00:46.120" style="s2">board to be part of this and they also</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.830" end="01:00:47.890" style="s2">have their own technology it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.120" end="01:00:49.690" style="s2">important piece to know about right that</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.890" end="01:00:51.340" style="s2">yeah is that conflict of interest and</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.690" end="01:00:53.680" style="s2">not a conflict of interest it&#39;s like hey</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.340" end="01:00:58.120" style="s2">yeah I think maybe just a box that</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.680" end="01:01:00.880" style="s2">describes maybe even just relation ship</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.120" end="01:01:02.260" style="s2">to this idea and then you know we could</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.880" end="01:01:04.150" style="s2">just ride out there hey you know these</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.260" end="01:01:06.610" style="s2">people were inspired by this idea and</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.150" end="01:01:09.490" style="s2">you know for now let it be a paragraph</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.610" end="01:01:16.990" style="s2">and then we can and we see a pattern we</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.490" end="01:01:17.660" style="s2">can put ten columns sounds good so</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.990" end="01:01:20.690" style="s2">anything else you want</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.660" end="01:01:24.140" style="s2">talk about today right now before else</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.690" end="01:01:25.670" style="s2">need to write down what it is we know</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.140" end="01:01:26.569" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna brainstorm the missions team</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.670" end="01:01:28.039" style="s2">we kind of already came up with the</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.569" end="01:01:29.990" style="s2">mission statement but sitting with it</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.039" end="01:01:31.700" style="s2">that may be seen whether that</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.990" end="01:01:34.579" style="s2">encompasses like you had talked about an</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.700" end="01:01:36.170" style="s2">intimate conversation right um yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.579" end="01:01:37.940" style="s2">just think about it a bit and then maybe</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.170" end="01:01:40.430" style="s2">we could finalize on next meeting unless</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.940" end="01:01:41.900" style="s2">we don&#39;t feel comfortable with that yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.430" end="01:01:43.700" style="s2">and then the schedule requirements I</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.900" end="01:01:45.079" style="s2">think just individually brainstorming</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.700" end="01:01:47.150" style="s2">what we think that could look like and</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.079" end="01:01:51.380" style="s2">then coming back together and seeing how</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.150" end="01:01:52.640" style="s2">much we had in common as well as there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.380" end="01:01:54.200" style="s2">gonna be ones that you&#39;re I&#39;m like yes</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.640" end="01:01:58.400" style="s2">we need that and vice versa</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.200" end="01:02:01.400" style="s2">yeah yeah great to do together on air so</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.400" end="01:02:02.380" style="s2">people can see the discussion yeah</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.400" end="01:02:04.819" style="s2">absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.380" end="01:02:07.549" style="s2">right out scheduled requirements and</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.819" end="01:02:09.619" style="s2">we&#39;ve done a bit of that this week but</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.549" end="01:02:11.690" style="s2">for me I want to sit down with a piece</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.619" end="01:02:12.890" style="s2">of paper and be like as a user here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.690" end="01:02:14.599" style="s2">what I want it to look like because</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.890" end="01:02:16.339" style="s2">that&#39;s what I had to offer as far as</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.599" end="01:02:19.849" style="s2">I&#39;ve no idea how to actually code it or</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.339" end="01:02:21.740" style="s2">schedule it but like I have scheduled</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.849" end="01:02:23.869" style="s2">idea cafes and so I know what work is</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.740" end="01:02:25.130" style="s2">involved in that and knowing I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.869" end="01:02:27.079" style="s2">even know how to separate those in my</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.130" end="01:02:28.700" style="s2">mind like my experience as a user who</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.079" end="01:02:30.529" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have anything to do with it and</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.700" end="01:02:32.299" style="s2">my experience is the person coordinating</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.529" end="01:02:34.160" style="s2">it so I&#39;m gonna sit down and tease those</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.299" end="01:02:35.900" style="s2">apart a little bit of legs right those</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.160" end="01:02:39.650" style="s2">are very different but important</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.900" end="01:02:41.089" style="s2">important features yeah all right so</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.650" end="01:02:45.289" style="s2">that is what I&#39;m gonna do between now</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.089" end="01:02:47.390" style="s2">and next week next the other question</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.289" end="01:02:50.089" style="s2">was just what I had we discussed at the</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.390" end="01:02:53.059" style="s2">beginning for if you want to talk about</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.089" end="01:02:57.500" style="s2">create like an idea cafe I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.059" end="01:02:59.359" style="s2">I want a game B idea cafe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.500" end="01:03:01.160" style="s2">scheduled the same time every week</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.359" end="01:03:02.299" style="s2">because then I know it&#39;s in my schedule</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.160" end="01:03:04.400" style="s2">and I just want to have those</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.299" end="01:03:05.930" style="s2">conversations with game B people then</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.400" end="01:03:07.819" style="s2">people know to kind of show up that they</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.930" end="01:03:10.010" style="s2">know it&#39;s at that that time every time</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.819" end="01:03:11.569" style="s2">yeah I don&#39;t know if you want to work on</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.010" end="01:03:13.789" style="s2">that with me as far as I pick a time</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.569" end="01:03:14.900" style="s2">that you know you&#39;re generally available</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.789" end="01:03:16.010" style="s2">again you don&#39;t need to be available</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.900" end="01:03:18.859" style="s2">every week that you can come and</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.010" end="01:03:20.480" style="s2">participate but both a time it might</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.859" end="01:03:21.619" style="s2">work for you that it&#39;s not a time you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.480" end="01:03:25.760" style="s2">definitely not available</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.619" end="01:03:27.559" style="s2">yeah and a topic and I&#39;m doing that with</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.760" end="01:03:29.960" style="s2">with someone from game B as well she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.559" end="01:03:31.260" style="s2">the one who had wasn&#39;t able to go decks</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.960" end="01:03:33.000" style="s2">last week but</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.260" end="01:03:36.930" style="s2">being of conflict in the game be space</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.000" end="01:03:37.859" style="s2">that coordinating what am a topic</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.930" end="01:03:40.619" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t look like and that doesn&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.859" end="01:03:43.140" style="s2">to be one time slot will coordinate with</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.619" end="01:03:44.369" style="s2">a time slot that works for her and I and</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.140" end="01:03:46.260" style="s2">then put it out to the game be community</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.369" end="01:03:48.240" style="s2">who else wants to join the one I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.260" end="01:03:50.430" style="s2">talking about I want to have a time</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.240" end="01:03:53.910" style="s2">period that works for more people and so</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.430" end="01:03:55.109" style="s2">maybe what am I asking a doodle poll so</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.910" end="01:03:56.910" style="s2">we can pick times that we&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.109" end="01:03:58.619" style="s2">usually available and then also putting</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.910" end="01:03:59.970" style="s2">a note to them like if we can pick three</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.619" end="01:04:02.130" style="s2">or four times and then put it out to the</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.970" end="01:04:03.270" style="s2">game be space to see which times more</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.130" end="01:04:04.290" style="s2">people because if there&#39;s like twelve</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.270" end="01:04:06.599" style="s2">people that are available</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.290" end="01:04:09.230" style="s2">who will consistently have four people</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.599" end="01:04:12.869" style="s2">show up to those ones to be part of it</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.230" end="01:04:16.829" style="s2">so yeah I can create a quick doodle poll</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.869" end="01:04:19.500" style="s2">and then send you the link and then we</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.829" end="01:04:24.060" style="s2">can just I&#39;m my schedule is pretty darn</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.500" end="01:04:27.060" style="s2">flexible actually but it may be easier</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.060" end="01:04:28.800" style="s2">to kind of coordinate with that I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.060" end="01:04:30.960" style="s2">just need to tell everyone you know your</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.800" end="01:04:32.369" style="s2">scheduling on this one specific week but</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.960" end="01:04:33.690" style="s2">think about all your weeks because they</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.369" end="01:04:40.410" style="s2">don&#39;t have a thing that says what am I</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.690" end="01:04:41.670" style="s2">generally available yes so guess what</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.410" end="01:04:42.900" style="s2">I&#39;m asking is I don&#39;t want just a doodle</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.670" end="01:04:44.910" style="s2">poll minute to go out there and me not</p>

<p begin="01:05:25.890" end="01:05:31.470" style="s2">in so that that that works yeah it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.220" end="01:05:34.680" style="s2">big piece of the scheduler time zones is</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.470" end="01:05:39.810" style="s2">like 90% of it yeah right</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.680" end="01:05:43.619" style="s2">I I am pretty darn flexible so Sunday</p>

<p begin="01:05:55.530" end="01:06:00.540" style="s2">best time is when my child is in school</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.589" end="01:06:02.250" style="s2">and my brain works better in them or</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.540" end="01:06:04.680" style="s2">like before she wakes up so like 6:00</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.250" end="01:06:06.060" style="s2">a.m. my time works well however then</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.680" end="01:06:07.349" style="s2">sometimes she wakes up during that time</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.060" end="01:06:09.570" style="s2">and if we&#39;re doing it for her</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.349" end="01:06:10.920" style="s2">it&#39;s an idea Cafe is half an hour so 6</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.570" end="01:06:13.109" style="s2">o&#39;clock in the morning on a weekday</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.920" end="01:06:15.150" style="s2">works great the weekends don&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.109" end="01:06:16.890" style="s2">great I already have my 9:00 a.m. on</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.150" end="01:06:18.150" style="s2">Saturdays with my brother and having</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.890" end="01:06:21.020" style="s2">other people and I&#39;m trying to keep my</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.150" end="01:06:24.180" style="s2">weekends with my kid and you know family</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.020" end="01:06:26.520" style="s2">but this is a big priority as far as her</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.180" end="01:06:29.460" style="s2">future and the planet so like if other</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.520" end="01:06:31.200" style="s2">people are available on Saturdays let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.460" end="01:06:32.820" style="s2">say 10:00 a.m. I&#39;m down with that</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.200" end="01:06:34.589" style="s2">because then at least it&#39;s like just</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.820" end="01:06:35.760" style="s2">Saturday mornings that I&#39;m concentrating</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.589" end="01:06:37.950" style="s2">this and then Saturday afternoons and</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.760" end="01:06:39.240" style="s2">all day sunday and Friday afternoons I</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.950" end="01:06:43.050" style="s2">have with her</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.240" end="01:06:44.250" style="s2">but generally 9:30 in the morning so I</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.050" end="01:06:48.060" style="s2">can drop her off at school and walk back</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.250" end="01:06:48.960" style="s2">to about 245 s have to be done by 2:45</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.060" end="01:06:58.050" style="s2">to go and pick her up</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.960" end="01:07:01.140" style="s2">so in in that time period is so I think</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.050" end="01:07:03.569" style="s2">if we put that in then I could block out</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.140" end="01:07:06.960" style="s2">the times I&#39;m not available it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.569" end="01:07:09.210" style="s2">like you said 9:30 was that mine sorry</p>

<p begin="01:08:46.500" end="01:08:52.770" style="s2">is just technology it should be it</p>

<p begin="01:08:52.770" end="01:08:57.060" style="s2">when I&#39;m available yeah or a group and</p>
