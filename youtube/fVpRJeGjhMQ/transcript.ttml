<p begin="00:00:04.240" end="00:00:07.839" style="s2">um i&#39;ve really been looking forward to</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.480" end="00:00:09.840" style="s2">this conversation for</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.839" end="00:00:10.960" style="s2">um quite some time now since since you</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.840" end="00:00:14.559" style="s2">agreed to have it</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.960" end="00:00:15.200" style="s2">um for me this is a special day because</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.559" end="00:00:17.600" style="s2">i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.200" end="00:00:19.279" style="s2">aware of your work for 25 years of doing</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.600" end="00:00:21.439" style="s2">research and</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.279" end="00:00:23.680" style="s2">exploring practice and sustainability</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.439" end="00:00:27.199" style="s2">and regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.680" end="00:00:28.800" style="s2">methods to avoid the trajectory that you</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.199" end="00:00:32.079" style="s2">warned of</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.800" end="00:00:35.600" style="s2">by now 48 years ago with your co-authors</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.079" end="00:00:39.040" style="s2">and it&#39;s a simple seemingly</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.600" end="00:00:41.680" style="s2">obvious truth that you cannot have</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.040" end="00:00:45.680" style="s2">exponential growth on a finite planet</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.680" end="00:00:49.520" style="s2">but for some reason humanity has</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.680" end="00:00:52.640" style="s2">been unable or the</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.520" end="00:00:53.760" style="s2">the people in charge or whoever has been</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.640" end="00:00:56.399" style="s2">unable</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.760" end="00:00:57.360" style="s2">to really respond to this truth in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.399" end="00:00:59.600" style="s2">appropriate way</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.360" end="00:01:01.199" style="s2">and i&#39;m i&#39;m remembering a conversation i</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.600" end="00:01:04.159" style="s2">had a couple of years ago</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.199" end="00:01:05.360" style="s2">with um dr michael mcdonald who in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.159" end="00:01:08.880" style="s2">1980s</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.360" end="00:01:12.479" style="s2">did some work for the us government</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.880" end="00:01:15.360" style="s2">where they ended up with a report in</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.479" end="00:01:17.200" style="s2">late 1980s basically saying that if we</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.360" end="00:01:20.880" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t change our trajectory</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.200" end="00:01:23.920" style="s2">by the mid 1990s then</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.880" end="00:01:26.799" style="s2">according to their work by the somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.920" end="00:01:29.040" style="s2">between 2030 and 2050</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.799" end="00:01:31.280" style="s2">a massive die off of global population</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.040" end="00:01:31.840" style="s2">would happen and collapses of ecosystems</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.280" end="00:01:35.439" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.840" end="00:01:37.360" style="s2">cascade and obviously we haven&#39;t um</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.439" end="00:01:38.960" style="s2">made that change and i&#39;ve also recently</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.360" end="00:01:41.280" style="s2">heard heard you a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.960" end="00:01:42.000" style="s2">years ago also make that point and when</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.280" end="00:01:44.000" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.000" end="00:01:46.159" style="s2">45th anniversary of limits to growth</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.000" end="00:01:49.360" style="s2">happened you basically said there is now</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.159" end="00:01:52.399" style="s2">no chance to avoid collapse um</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.360" end="00:01:55.520" style="s2">how would you turn that</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.399" end="00:01:57.600" style="s2">problem into</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.520" end="00:01:59.600" style="s2">a potential do you still see a potential</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.600" end="00:02:02.479" style="s2">for us if if we do the right things</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.600" end="00:02:03.280" style="s2">as a species and in our communities</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.479" end="00:02:06.000" style="s2">locally</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.280" end="00:02:06.719" style="s2">to respond to the reality that we&#39;re now</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.000" end="00:02:08.800" style="s2">heading</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.719" end="00:02:10.560" style="s2">for collapse and we&#39;re seeing systems</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.800" end="00:02:14.480" style="s2">collapse all around us</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.560" end="00:02:16.560" style="s2">and what do you think needs to be done</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.480" end="00:02:19.040" style="s2">you&#39;ve spent 50 years of your career</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.560" end="00:02:22.959" style="s2">working on this</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.040" end="00:02:26.640" style="s2">so at each moment</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.959" end="00:02:29.760" style="s2">each of us has uh choices</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.640" end="00:02:31.680" style="s2">uh between different actions and some of</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.760" end="00:02:33.280" style="s2">those actions will make the future</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.680" end="00:02:35.200" style="s2">better than it would have been otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.280" end="00:02:37.920" style="s2">and some of those choices</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.200" end="00:02:40.160" style="s2">will make it worse or at least not</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.920" end="00:02:43.680" style="s2">improve it very much</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.160" end="00:02:47.599" style="s2">that&#39;s still true absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.680" end="00:02:48.239" style="s2">however the notion that there is some</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.599" end="00:02:52.400" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.239" end="00:02:54.319" style="s2">fairly attractive sustainable society</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.400" end="00:02:56.239" style="s2">ahead of us if we can only find it i</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.319" end="00:02:59.760" style="s2">think is now</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.239" end="00:03:02.800" style="s2">a fantasy the</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.760" end="00:03:05.840" style="s2">global population its</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.800" end="00:03:09.280" style="s2">use of materials its uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.840" end="00:03:13.120" style="s2">generation of uh wastes</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.280" end="00:03:16.840" style="s2">has grown so far above the sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.120" end="00:03:19.760" style="s2">capacity of the planet that uh there is</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.840" end="00:03:24.000" style="s2">that there&#39;s nothing ahead that it</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.760" end="00:03:25.840" style="s2">uh it looks like this um</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.000" end="00:03:27.599" style="s2">you know i don&#39;t know sustainable utopia</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.840" end="00:03:31.599" style="s2">people might talk about</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.599" end="00:03:35.599" style="s2">so what can you do well uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.599" end="00:03:38.000" style="s2">i a global die-off is</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.599" end="00:03:40.560" style="s2">of course one possibility you can come</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.000" end="00:03:42.640" style="s2">up with a number of realistic</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.560" end="00:03:43.760" style="s2">uh scenarios that would produce that</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.640" end="00:03:45.840" style="s2">ranging from a</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.760" end="00:03:47.040" style="s2">massive volcanic explosion that shuts</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.840" end="00:03:50.400" style="s2">down food production</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.040" end="00:03:55.200" style="s2">to you know asteroids hitting us and uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.400" end="00:03:56.560" style="s2">or a really uh vicious uh pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.200" end="00:03:59.120" style="s2">you know it&#39;s useful to remember that</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.560" end="00:04:01.200" style="s2">this virus we&#39;re dealing with now is</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.120" end="00:04:04.239" style="s2">actually not a vicious virus it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.200" end="00:04:07.519" style="s2">infectious but it&#39;s not very lethal</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.239" end="00:04:10.560" style="s2">and sars for example was very lethal</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.519" end="00:04:12.239" style="s2">but not very infectious it sars killed i</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.560" end="00:04:15.840" style="s2">don&#39;t know 20 30 percent of the people</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.239" end="00:04:16.320" style="s2">infected this one is uh not even able to</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.840" end="00:04:18.720" style="s2">manage</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.320" end="00:04:19.840" style="s2">uh one percent so if you got something</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.720" end="00:04:21.359" style="s2">in both infectious</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.840" end="00:04:23.680" style="s2">and lethal then you that would be</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.359" end="00:04:25.280" style="s2">another well so those scenarios are</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.680" end="00:04:29.600" style="s2">possible but there are also</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.280" end="00:04:31.600" style="s2">scenarios in which the system sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.600" end="00:04:33.199" style="s2">struggles and through fits and starts</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.600" end="00:04:35.840" style="s2">gets down to a</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.199" end="00:04:36.720" style="s2">lower level of population and material</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.840" end="00:04:39.759" style="s2">flow</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.720" end="00:04:40.400" style="s2">i i hope for the second because it means</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.759" end="00:04:42.639" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.400" end="00:04:45.120" style="s2">am able within my own community to do</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.639" end="00:04:48.560" style="s2">things that</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.120" end="00:04:51.919" style="s2">are have a have potential</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.560" end="00:04:51.919" style="s2">but now instead of</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.240" end="00:04:56.880" style="s2">trying to achieve sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.040" end="00:04:59.520" style="s2">development i am looking for</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.880" end="00:05:01.600" style="s2">ways to change achieve what i call</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.520" end="00:05:06.000" style="s2">resilient development uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.600" end="00:05:09.039" style="s2">patterns of social society that are</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.000" end="00:05:10.880" style="s2">relatively immune to big shocks</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.039" end="00:05:13.039" style="s2">i could get into a lot of detail about</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.880" end="00:05:14.400" style="s2">that not relevant here but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.039" end="00:05:16.160" style="s2">those are the areas where i see</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.400" end="00:05:16.479" style="s2">interesting things to be done now well</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.160" end="00:05:20.000" style="s2">i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.479" end="00:05:22.560" style="s2">i&#39;d love to just very briefly outline</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.000" end="00:05:23.280" style="s2">some of my perspective that resonates</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.560" end="00:05:25.919" style="s2">with this</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.280" end="00:05:27.280" style="s2">around like i would call it um like in</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.919" end="00:05:29.759" style="s2">my book i speak about this</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.280" end="00:05:30.400" style="s2">designing regenerative cultures plural</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.759" end="00:05:34.479" style="s2">and i</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.400" end="00:05:37.600" style="s2">i um invite people through 250 questions</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.479" end="00:05:38.080" style="s2">into a process of at their local level</p>

<p begin="00:05:42.160" end="00:05:46.400" style="s2">um set in to explore these questions in</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.199" end="00:05:49.039" style="s2">order to</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.400" end="00:05:51.520" style="s2">what i engage in what i would call a</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.039" end="00:05:55.039" style="s2">dual pathway which is on the one hand</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.520" end="00:05:57.120" style="s2">um the resilience building for</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.039" end="00:05:58.800" style="s2">the disruptions that are just going to</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.120" end="00:06:00.720" style="s2">come hitting harder and faster in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.800" end="00:06:02.960" style="s2">next two or three decades</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.720" end="00:06:04.080" style="s2">but at the same time by engaging people</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.960" end="00:06:07.680" style="s2">really in</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.080" end="00:06:09.800" style="s2">local ecosystems restoration and um</p>

<p begin="00:06:34.639" end="00:06:38.000" style="s2">collapsing partially because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.000" end="00:06:39.600" style="s2">patterns that no longer serve and that</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.000" end="00:06:43.360" style="s2">cannot be sustained</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.600" end="00:06:46.160" style="s2">but um what i would hope is that because</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.360" end="00:06:47.039" style="s2">this dual path of preparing for the</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.160" end="00:06:50.160" style="s2">worst</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.039" end="00:06:53.039" style="s2">and trying to engage in</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.160" end="00:06:54.160" style="s2">um drawing down carbon and healing</p>

<p begin="00:06:54.160" end="00:06:59.680" style="s2">we might just if we engage all of her</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.440" end="00:07:00.720" style="s2">humanity in global solidarity in this</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.680" end="00:07:03.199" style="s2">which i know is</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.720" end="00:07:04.080" style="s2">is a utopian in and of itself to some</p>

<p begin="00:07:04.080" end="00:07:11.280" style="s2">um we might still have a snowball&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.440" end="00:07:13.120" style="s2">chance in hell if we decide to do this</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.280" end="00:07:14.560" style="s2">relatively quickly would you would you</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.120" end="00:07:18.319" style="s2">say that that is</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.560" end="00:07:18.319" style="s2">also too optimistic</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.000" end="00:07:23.120" style="s2">well you&#39;ve covered a lot of ground with</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.599" end="00:07:26.800" style="s2">your uh narrative</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.120" end="00:07:30.319" style="s2">um some of which seemed</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.800" end="00:07:32.639" style="s2">to me uh quite uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.319" end="00:07:34.000" style="s2">fantastical and others uh perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.639" end="00:07:38.000" style="s2">realistic</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.000" end="00:07:41.919" style="s2">uh let&#39;s put this in uh context</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.000" end="00:07:44.800" style="s2">we or you use the term collapse</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.919" end="00:07:46.319" style="s2">actually we never used that term in any</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.800" end="00:07:50.080" style="s2">of our work</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.319" end="00:07:53.280" style="s2">uh i i don&#39;t think it generates</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.080" end="00:07:56.479" style="s2">um useful thinking</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.280" end="00:07:59.520" style="s2">uh and and it&#39;s actually uh from</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.479" end="00:08:01.840" style="s2">some perspectives not accurate from the</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.520" end="00:08:03.199" style="s2">perspective of industrial society or</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.840" end="00:08:07.440" style="s2">from the perspective</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.199" end="00:08:11.039" style="s2">of uh our species</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.440" end="00:08:14.560" style="s2">uh some things are collapsing now</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.039" end="00:08:17.599" style="s2">uh uh the climate uh is</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.560" end="00:08:19.520" style="s2">changing drastically etc but from the</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.599" end="00:08:21.440" style="s2">perspective of the planet</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.520" end="00:08:23.199" style="s2">you know it&#39;s not a collapse it&#39;s simply</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.440" end="00:08:26.560" style="s2">moving over into a new mode</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.199" end="00:08:28.479" style="s2">of uh behavior i was</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.560" end="00:08:29.840" style="s2">talking about these issues recently with</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.479" end="00:08:32.240" style="s2">a friend and</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.840" end="00:08:34.080" style="s2">he uh you know became alarmed and said</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.240" end="00:08:37.200" style="s2">oh my goodness we have to</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.080" end="00:08:39.279" style="s2">uh save the planet and i said no we</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.200" end="00:08:41.919" style="s2">don&#39;t have to save the planet the planet</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.279" end="00:08:43.440" style="s2">knows how to save itself it&#39;s uh been</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.919" end="00:08:44.480" style="s2">doing that for several hundred million</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.440" end="00:08:46.080" style="s2">years and i have</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.480" end="00:08:48.240" style="s2">absolute confidence is going to keep</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.080" end="00:08:49.680" style="s2">doing it for another</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.240" end="00:08:51.680" style="s2">couple hundred million years till the</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.680" end="00:08:54.399" style="s2">sun blows up yeah anyway</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.680" end="00:08:55.040" style="s2">and uh so it&#39;s we don&#39;t have to save the</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.399" end="00:08:57.600" style="s2">planet</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.040" end="00:08:58.880" style="s2">uh what&#39;s of concern to us is whether we</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.600" end="00:09:01.680" style="s2">can save</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.880" end="00:09:02.160" style="s2">some of the elements of what we consider</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.680" end="00:09:04.720" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.160" end="00:09:06.720" style="s2">an acceptable decent attractive</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.720" end="00:09:09.839" style="s2">lifestyle</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.720" end="00:09:11.440" style="s2">so uh process collapsing for</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.839" end="00:09:12.959" style="s2">you know for most everybody else it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.440" end="00:09:15.920" style="s2">not actually the</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.959" end="00:09:16.800" style="s2">critters in my backyard uh are enjoying</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.920" end="00:09:19.760" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.800" end="00:09:21.440" style="s2">the virus it&#39;s uh reduced the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.760" end="00:09:23.519" style="s2">traffic on the road and</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.440" end="00:09:25.120" style="s2">the noise levels etc you know so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.519" end="00:09:27.600" style="s2">just a question of perspective</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.120" end="00:09:29.440" style="s2">and just to clarify when i use the word</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.600" end="00:09:30.240" style="s2">collapse and mine i mean collapse in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.440" end="00:09:32.240" style="s2">context of</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.240" end="00:09:33.839" style="s2">um if you if you think of buzz hollings</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.240" end="00:09:36.720" style="s2">work on um</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.839" end="00:09:38.320" style="s2">the adaptive cycle and systems that you</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.720" end="00:09:39.760" style="s2">that you do have phases</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.320" end="00:09:42.720" style="s2">in in the sort of what he called a</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.760" end="00:09:45.040" style="s2">panicky you have this nested system</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.720" end="00:09:46.240" style="s2">where you find collapses and happening</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.040" end="00:09:48.959" style="s2">at different scales</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.240" end="00:09:50.160" style="s2">and both temporally and spatially and</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.959" end="00:09:52.480" style="s2">they&#39;re really just</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.160" end="00:09:54.399" style="s2">a dissolution of system structures and</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.480" end="00:09:57.120" style="s2">patterns that no longer serve</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.399" end="00:09:57.440" style="s2">and that then enable the reorganization</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.120" end="00:10:01.360" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.440" end="00:10:04.160" style="s2">have a new loop of um innovation so</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.360" end="00:10:05.360" style="s2">so i agree that gaia will be fine</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.160" end="00:10:07.600" style="s2">without us um</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.360" end="00:10:09.600" style="s2">but so i admired buzz i actually worked</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.600" end="00:10:11.920" style="s2">under him uh when he</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.600" end="00:10:14.079" style="s2">briefly ran the institute for applied</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.920" end="00:10:16.880" style="s2">systems analysis in vienna</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.079" end="00:10:18.560" style="s2">and i i gained a lot from his work i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.880" end="00:10:20.560" style="s2">have to go back and look i&#39;m not sure he</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.560" end="00:10:22.240" style="s2">used the term collapse</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.560" end="00:10:26.000" style="s2">you know he was interested in different</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.240" end="00:10:30.000" style="s2">dynamic uh behavior patterns</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.000" end="00:10:31.040" style="s2">i think in this connection it may be</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.000" end="00:10:34.079" style="s2">useful</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.040" end="00:10:36.880" style="s2">and again trying to give you a</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.079" end="00:10:40.560" style="s2">a a framework within which you can</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.880" end="00:10:40.560" style="s2">discuss this idea of what you can do</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.640" end="00:10:48.320" style="s2">uh we are uh confronted</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.480" end="00:10:52.399" style="s2">with a variety of different uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.320" end="00:10:54.720" style="s2">existential issues the virus is</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.399" end="00:10:56.240" style="s2">actually one of them uh nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.720" end="00:10:59.440" style="s2">proliferation</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.240" end="00:11:02.560" style="s2">climate change uh and and many others</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.440" end="00:11:04.399" style="s2">i find it useful to uh separate these</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.560" end="00:11:08.000" style="s2">into two categories</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.399" end="00:11:10.880" style="s2">universal and global universal problems</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.000" end="00:11:12.399" style="s2">uh affect everybody uh but they manifest</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.880" end="00:11:15.839" style="s2">locally and there are things you can do</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.399" end="00:11:18.720" style="s2">locally to reduce their</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.839" end="00:11:21.120" style="s2">problems and and when you invest in</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.720" end="00:11:24.480" style="s2">local solutions</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.120" end="00:11:28.240" style="s2">rather soon and rather nearby</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.480" end="00:11:28.480" style="s2">there&#39;s benefit that&#39;s uh such things as</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.240" end="00:11:31.600" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.480" end="00:11:34.880" style="s2">water contamination noise</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.600" end="00:11:37.839" style="s2">uh let&#39;s say deforestation everybody</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.880" end="00:11:39.600" style="s2">suffers from deforestation but uh in</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.839" end="00:11:42.640" style="s2">nigeria or in texas</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.600" end="00:11:43.200" style="s2">or in china you can do something about</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.640" end="00:11:45.200" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.200" end="00:11:47.040" style="s2">and realize the benefits without waiting</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.200" end="00:11:49.839" style="s2">for the whole rest of the planet</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.040" end="00:11:51.680" style="s2">uh to fall in line and help out other</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.839" end="00:11:54.800" style="s2">problems like nuclear proliferation</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.680" end="00:11:57.920" style="s2">climate change uh and</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.800" end="00:11:59.120" style="s2">and now i will say this virus uh are</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.920" end="00:12:01.040" style="s2">global problems</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.120" end="00:12:02.240" style="s2">there is a virtually nothing you can do</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.040" end="00:12:05.279" style="s2">locally</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.240" end="00:12:06.399" style="s2">uh to solve the problem you need for</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.279" end="00:12:10.639" style="s2">everybody to get</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.399" end="00:12:12.880" style="s2">on board and agree about a solution</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.639" end="00:12:14.320" style="s2">this distinction is useful and in my</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.880" end="00:12:17.760" style="s2">thinking because i see</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.320" end="00:12:20.560" style="s2">no hope whatsoever for achieving</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.760" end="00:12:22.160" style="s2">a solution to global problems i i just</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.560" end="00:12:24.399" style="s2">do not</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.160" end="00:12:26.639" style="s2">see any basis in history or anything in</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.399" end="00:12:29.360" style="s2">the current news to suggest</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.639" end="00:12:31.360" style="s2">that suddenly people are going to start</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.360" end="00:12:33.680" style="s2">sacrificing what they perceive to be in</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.360" end="00:12:37.519" style="s2">their own short-term best interest</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.680" end="00:12:39.440" style="s2">for the better and longer term good</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.519" end="00:12:41.760" style="s2">these issues like climate change will</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.440" end="00:12:44.880" style="s2">resolve themselves but they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.760" end="00:12:46.720" style="s2">uh produce uh solutions that are imposed</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.880" end="00:12:50.320" style="s2">on us not ones that we</p>

<p begin="00:13:36.399" end="00:13:39.440" style="s2">typically</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.519" end="00:13:40.959" style="s2">a small group of people working in</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.440" end="00:13:43.839" style="s2">alignment uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.959" end="00:13:45.120" style="s2">can have a significant constructive</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.839" end="00:13:48.320" style="s2">impact</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.120" end="00:13:51.440" style="s2">yeah no i completely agree with that</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.320" end="00:13:52.959" style="s2">and i mean for a long part of my work</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.440" end="00:13:53.600" style="s2">i&#39;ve been working with the eco village</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.959" end="00:13:55.600" style="s2">movement</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.600" end="00:13:56.880" style="s2">and the transition town movement and</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.600" end="00:13:59.199" style="s2">engaging people</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.880" end="00:14:00.399" style="s2">with basically local resilience building</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.199" end="00:14:03.199" style="s2">and doing</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.399" end="00:14:04.000" style="s2">what they can in their region um</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.199" end="00:14:05.760" style="s2">creating</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.000" end="00:14:07.839" style="s2">models of more sustainable ways of</p>

<p begin="00:14:07.839" end="00:14:11.920" style="s2">i i do sense that we&#39;re now at a point</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.839" end="00:14:13.199" style="s2">where we&#39;re beginning to wake up that if</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.920" end="00:14:15.519" style="s2">we all did this</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.199" end="00:14:16.399" style="s2">well in our bioregions i think the shift</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.519" end="00:14:18.880" style="s2">that i&#39;ve made</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.399" end="00:14:20.560" style="s2">is that i used to be very focused on the</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.880" end="00:14:22.720" style="s2">very small community scale</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.560" end="00:14:24.399" style="s2">like neighborhood size or intentional</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.720" end="00:14:24.800" style="s2">community size a few hundred people a</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.399" end="00:14:28.000" style="s2">few</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.800" end="00:14:30.480" style="s2">thousand people and um what i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.000" end="00:14:31.440" style="s2">come to see is that the the systemic</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.480" end="00:14:34.000" style="s2">integration</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.440" end="00:14:36.320" style="s2">of how to meet basic needs of a</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.000" end="00:14:38.959" style="s2">population within</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.320" end="00:14:39.360" style="s2">a given spatial context you need a</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.959" end="00:14:41.519" style="s2">little</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.360" end="00:14:44.160" style="s2">larger area than just a community and</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.519" end="00:14:45.760" style="s2">and so the bioregional approach that has</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.160" end="00:14:48.000" style="s2">been around for a long time but</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.760" end="00:14:48.880" style="s2">but has found it hard to sort of get off</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.000" end="00:14:50.639" style="s2">the ground</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.880" end="00:14:52.959" style="s2">um is something that i i see a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.639" end="00:14:56.160" style="s2">people converging on now</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.959" end="00:14:57.680" style="s2">um do you have any comments on on the</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.160" end="00:15:01.360" style="s2">difference between working</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.680" end="00:15:02.240" style="s2">like as we&#39;re working more on universal</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.360" end="00:15:05.120" style="s2">problems</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.240" end="00:15:06.560" style="s2">at the local stroke regional level um</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.120" end="00:15:07.600" style="s2">how do you see that the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.560" end="00:15:09.600" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.600" end="00:15:11.199" style="s2">those scales that the small community</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.600" end="00:15:12.000" style="s2">scale and the wider region of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.199" end="00:15:16.399" style="s2">community sits</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.000" end="00:15:18.480" style="s2">in well first of all i&#39;d comment that</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.399" end="00:15:20.959" style="s2">uh at least for myself i&#39;m always</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.480" end="00:15:22.160" style="s2">skeptical about my opinions because i</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.959" end="00:15:25.040" style="s2">realize</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.160" end="00:15:26.000" style="s2">the extent to which each of us moves in</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.040" end="00:15:28.079" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.000" end="00:15:30.160" style="s2">information bubble which tends to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.079" end="00:15:34.480" style="s2">self-confirming</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.160" end="00:15:37.519" style="s2">uh you know i i used to call this the</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.480" end="00:15:39.680" style="s2">boston san francisco syndrome i would</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.519" end="00:15:41.199" style="s2">work in i taught for a while in boston</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.680" end="00:15:43.600" style="s2">and i would fly out and talk to my</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.199" end="00:15:45.920" style="s2">colleagues in san francisco</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.600" end="00:15:48.000" style="s2">and they had the same opinions and uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.920" end="00:15:49.600" style="s2">were worried about the same things as</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.000" end="00:15:50.959" style="s2">we were in boston and i would sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.600" end="00:15:52.320" style="s2">then look at a map of the united states</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.959" end="00:15:55.040" style="s2">and say my gosh</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.320" end="00:15:57.120" style="s2">look at the whole country is uh moving</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.040" end="00:16:00.079" style="s2">in the right direction and of course</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.120" end="00:16:01.519" style="s2">if i&#39;d stopped off in des moines or uh</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.079" end="00:16:03.360" style="s2">ohio or</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.519" end="00:16:05.440" style="s2">montana on the way between the two</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.360" end="00:16:06.399" style="s2">cities i would have been forced to have</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.440" end="00:16:09.120" style="s2">a different opinion</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.399" end="00:16:09.440" style="s2">and now it&#39;s not only your social circle</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.120" end="00:16:12.399" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.440" end="00:16:14.399" style="s2">it&#39;s the algorithms on google which</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.399" end="00:16:16.399" style="s2">decide which pieces of news</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.399" end="00:16:18.160" style="s2">you&#39;re likely to be interested in or</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.399" end="00:16:20.160" style="s2">what kind of products you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.160" end="00:16:21.360" style="s2">most likely to want to buy so so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.160" end="00:16:24.320" style="s2">always skeptical</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.360" end="00:16:25.759" style="s2">about my own opinions now do i have</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.320" end="00:16:29.600" style="s2">opinions like you have</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.759" end="00:16:32.880" style="s2">um to some extent and in limited</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.600" end="00:16:36.399" style="s2">areas for example in my region where i</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.880" end="00:16:39.279" style="s2">live there</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.399" end="00:16:41.279" style="s2">is a regeneration of small-scale</p>

<p begin="00:16:41.279" end="00:16:47.360" style="s2">i have seen over the last 10 or 20 years</p>

<p begin="00:16:51.199" end="00:16:58.320" style="s2">and uh you know alternative energy</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.120" end="00:17:00.800" style="s2">uh healthier lifestyles are these things</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.320" end="00:17:00.800" style="s2">you can see</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.959" end="00:17:04.799" style="s2">but how characteristic are they of</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.199" end="00:17:07.760" style="s2">what&#39;s happening around the planet</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.799" end="00:17:10.000" style="s2">uh i don&#39;t think very uh the vast</p>

<p begin="00:17:14.160" end="00:17:18.240" style="s2">and trying to secure enough food and</p>

<p begin="00:17:22.559" end="00:17:29.960" style="s2">uh short-term sacrifices you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.559" end="00:17:32.880" style="s2">you know the the issue that we face is</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.960" end="00:17:37.280" style="s2">that um</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.880" end="00:17:41.440" style="s2">some problems let you</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.280" end="00:17:41.440" style="s2">pay now and get the benefits now</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.000" end="00:17:48.160" style="s2">other problems force you to pay now</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.280" end="00:17:49.280" style="s2">and then somebody else over elsewhere</p>

<p begin="00:17:49.280" end="00:17:53.600" style="s2">gets the benefits uh climate change is a</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.360" end="00:17:56.480" style="s2">good example of the second one</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.600" end="00:17:57.520" style="s2">uh any sacrifice i make for climate</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.480" end="00:17:59.200" style="s2">change is</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.520" end="00:18:01.200" style="s2">basically not going to accrue to me</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.200" end="00:18:04.400" style="s2">personally but to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.200" end="00:18:05.280" style="s2">general system well most people aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.400" end="00:18:08.240" style="s2">in a position</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.280" end="00:18:10.880" style="s2">to make those short-term sacrifices for</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.240" end="00:18:15.039" style="s2">long-term results</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.880" end="00:18:18.559" style="s2">i um i developed a uh computerized</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.039" end="00:18:20.720" style="s2">fishing game which was an attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.559" end="00:18:21.840" style="s2">let people role play uh running a</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.720" end="00:18:23.600" style="s2">fishing fleet and</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.840" end="00:18:25.120" style="s2">make some points about sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.600" end="00:18:26.480" style="s2">harvest and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.120" end="00:18:28.880" style="s2">i played it with a group of maine</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.480" end="00:18:32.000" style="s2">fishermen who rather quickly</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.880" end="00:18:32.799" style="s2">in the game over harvested the marine</p>

<p begin="00:18:32.799" end="00:18:36.320" style="s2">and collapsed the industry you know and</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.120" end="00:18:37.919" style="s2">then we stopped the game and talked</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.320" end="00:18:39.360" style="s2">about it and most of them said you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.919" end="00:18:42.240" style="s2">you&#39;re absolutely right this game</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.360" end="00:18:45.200" style="s2">exactly captures the features of reality</p>

<p begin="00:21:56.320" end="00:21:59.440" style="s2">basically we would need to transform our</p>

<p begin="00:25:42.880" end="00:25:46.720" style="s2">i completely agree with you</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.559" end="00:25:48.640" style="s2">yeah so now but the narrow answer to</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.720" end="00:25:52.000" style="s2">your question uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.640" end="00:25:55.919" style="s2">is there any chance that we could muster</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.000" end="00:25:58.159" style="s2">the technological and economic uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.919" end="00:26:01.919" style="s2">resources of the planet</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.159" end="00:26:04.960" style="s2">to create a society</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.919" end="00:26:08.159" style="s2">which uh sustainably uses four</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.960" end="00:26:11.279" style="s2">elements no not a not on your life</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.159" end="00:26:13.279" style="s2">i mean that&#39;s such a remote and i must</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.279" end="00:26:15.360" style="s2">say unattractive idea that i</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.279" end="00:26:17.600" style="s2">uh i i don&#39;t see why somebody would</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.360" end="00:26:21.340" style="s2">spend 20 years of their life on it but</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.600" end="00:26:22.880" style="s2">you know no that&#39;s not my okay i mean i</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.340" end="00:26:25.440" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.880" end="00:26:26.720" style="s2">first of all it&#39;s in the context of like</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.440" end="00:26:31.200" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m not at all</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.720" end="00:26:33.440" style="s2">a um sort of technological optimist or</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.200" end="00:26:35.120" style="s2">pretending that technology will ride</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.440" end="00:26:38.400" style="s2">over the hill to save us</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.120" end="00:26:40.380" style="s2">um what i think uh ian was exploring</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.400" end="00:26:42.640" style="s2">is how we can</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.380" end="00:26:45.520" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.640" end="00:26:46.159" style="s2">make it easier for these future ways of</p>

<p begin="00:26:46.159" end="00:26:50.640" style="s2">will be much closer to the past ways of</p>

<p begin="00:26:54.000" end="00:26:58.400" style="s2">ours um so i think indigenous there are</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.120" end="00:27:01.279" style="s2">plenty of examples of</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.400" end="00:27:02.960" style="s2">indigenous people um exploiting the</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.279" end="00:27:05.440" style="s2">ecosystems but there&#39;s also plenty of</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.960" end="00:27:08.159" style="s2">examples of indigenous people</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.440" end="00:27:09.840" style="s2">working as elegant keystone species</p>

<p begin="00:27:16.960" end="00:27:21.600" style="s2">and um my my sense is that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.919" end="00:27:25.200" style="s2">we&#39;re definitely not going to</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.600" end="00:27:27.360" style="s2">back to some kind of golden and past but</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.200" end="00:27:28.799" style="s2">with the right type of technology we</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.360" end="00:27:31.520" style="s2">could possibly</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.799" end="00:27:32.320" style="s2">blend a much more regionalized much</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.520" end="00:27:34.480" style="s2">simpler</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.320" end="00:27:35.600" style="s2">much lower level of consumption but</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.480" end="00:27:37.200" style="s2">possibly</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.600" end="00:27:39.039" style="s2">higher in meaning and higher in human</p>

<p begin="00:27:43.840" end="00:27:48.240" style="s2">um might still have that technological</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.320" end="00:27:51.919" style="s2">component and i think that&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.240" end="00:27:51.919" style="s2">where where the work is coming from</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.799" end="00:27:56.000" style="s2">is is that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.159" end="00:28:01.200" style="s2">more regionalized localized lower attack</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.360" end="00:28:04.720" style="s2">lower consumption</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.200" end="00:28:07.520" style="s2">but blended with some</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.720" end="00:28:08.399" style="s2">technology future at all something that</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.520" end="00:28:11.200" style="s2">you could</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.399" end="00:28:13.440" style="s2">imagine after the work that you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.200" end="00:28:13.440" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.320" end="00:28:18.159" style="s2">yes i could imagine it</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.799" end="00:28:23.120" style="s2">but unlikely or i mean</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.039" end="00:28:30.559" style="s2">well it&#39;s um i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.799" end="00:28:32.960" style="s2">you know i&#39;m thinking back i of course</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.559" end="00:28:35.039" style="s2">have been</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.960" end="00:28:37.120" style="s2">in discussions about these issues for</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.039" end="00:28:38.640" style="s2">almost 50 years now since uh limits to</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.120" end="00:28:41.919" style="s2">growth came out</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.640" end="00:28:46.799" style="s2">i&#39;ve been struck by the extent to which</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.919" end="00:28:49.440" style="s2">the let us call them social scientists</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.799" end="00:28:52.000" style="s2">uh believe that the solution to our</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.440" end="00:28:53.760" style="s2">problems lies in technology</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.000" end="00:28:55.039" style="s2">and the technologists when they look at</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.760" end="00:28:57.200" style="s2">these problems can</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.039" end="00:28:58.880" style="s2">conclude that actually the solution lies</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.200" end="00:29:02.640" style="s2">off in</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.880" end="00:29:05.120" style="s2">social innovation so</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.640" end="00:29:06.159" style="s2">my formal training as a scientist in</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.120" end="00:29:10.000" style="s2">chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.159" end="00:29:10.000" style="s2">i guess puts me in the second camp</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.559" end="00:29:14.080" style="s2">it would be intellectually challenging</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.200" end="00:29:18.080" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.080" end="00:29:20.159" style="s2">think how you could uh</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.080" end="00:29:22.000" style="s2">build up a society based on four</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.159" end="00:29:25.440" style="s2">elements that are</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.000" end="00:29:27.679" style="s2">continuously recycled but uh i think</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.440" end="00:29:30.399" style="s2">uh you won&#39;t succeed and if you did it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.679" end="00:29:34.159" style="s2">not gonna actually do much for you</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.399" end="00:29:35.840" style="s2">anyway i think i have found very useful</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.159" end="00:29:39.279" style="s2">to remember</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.840" end="00:29:43.279" style="s2">technology is not</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.279" end="00:29:46.799" style="s2">an independent value-free</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.279" end="00:29:50.720" style="s2">force that comes in looks around</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.799" end="00:29:54.080" style="s2">sees a problem and solves it technology</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.720" end="00:29:57.919" style="s2">is a value laden</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.080" end="00:30:01.200" style="s2">tool wielded developed and wielded</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.919" end="00:30:02.159" style="s2">by people who in most cases have their</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.200" end="00:30:05.840" style="s2">own</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.159" end="00:30:08.720" style="s2">short-term interests you know uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.840" end="00:30:10.320" style="s2">one of the dominant sources of funding</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.720" end="00:30:11.440" style="s2">for new technology in the united states</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.320" end="00:30:14.000" style="s2">these days</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.440" end="00:30:15.840" style="s2">is the defense department now do you</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.000" end="00:30:16.640" style="s2">imagine that the defense department is</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.840" end="00:30:19.360" style="s2">trying to create</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.640" end="00:30:21.760" style="s2">technologies that will solve the world&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.360" end="00:30:25.760" style="s2">global problems</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.760" end="00:30:27.919" style="s2">not my experience drug companies spend a</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.760" end="00:30:30.880" style="s2">lot of money on technology</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.919" end="00:30:32.799" style="s2">do they spend it on the common uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.880" end="00:30:35.279" style="s2">problems of poor people</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.799" end="00:30:36.640" style="s2">no by and large they spend more money on</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.279" end="00:30:39.440" style="s2">things like</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.640" end="00:30:40.080" style="s2">restoring hair uh to rich people than</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.440" end="00:30:43.279" style="s2">they do</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.080" end="00:30:46.640" style="s2">on uh curing uh the diseases</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.279" end="00:30:49.200" style="s2">of uh into the third world people</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.640" end="00:30:50.240" style="s2">so so when you start talking about</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.200" end="00:30:53.120" style="s2">technology it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.240" end="00:30:55.360" style="s2">uh you need to remember that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.120" end="00:30:58.080" style="s2">actually talking</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.360" end="00:31:00.080" style="s2">or making assumptions about the goals</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.080" end="00:31:02.640" style="s2">and the capacities</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.080" end="00:31:06.320" style="s2">of people who feel that they will gain</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.640" end="00:31:10.000" style="s2">something by creating a new capability</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.320" end="00:31:12.640" style="s2">gaining profit or power</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.000" end="00:31:15.039" style="s2">or conceivably the psychological</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.640" end="00:31:18.240" style="s2">satisfaction of a job well done but</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.039" end="00:31:21.039" style="s2">uh but it&#39;s we shouldn&#39;t talk about</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.240" end="00:31:24.159" style="s2">technology as its own independence thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.039" end="00:31:25.279" style="s2">absolutely i mean i&#39;m i&#39;m reminded of</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.159" end="00:31:28.159" style="s2">buckminster fuller&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.279" end="00:31:29.760" style="s2">statement um when you try to change the</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.159" end="00:31:30.559" style="s2">way people think don&#39;t tell them what to</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.760" end="00:31:32.799" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.559" end="00:31:34.559" style="s2">give them a tool the use of which will</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.799" end="00:31:37.600" style="s2">change the way they think</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.559" end="00:31:39.600" style="s2">and um pretty much every technology</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.600" end="00:31:41.360" style="s2">is such a tool and that starting with</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.600" end="00:31:44.240" style="s2">the printing press and even before that</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.360" end="00:31:46.240" style="s2">um it has drastically changed the way we</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.240" end="00:31:48.640" style="s2">think and how how we see the world</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.240" end="00:31:50.080" style="s2">and i mean your work because you</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.640" end="00:31:53.600" style="s2">directed the institute</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.080" end="00:31:55.760" style="s2">for policy and um social science</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.600" end="00:31:57.600" style="s2">and and you also did a lot of work on</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.760" end="00:31:59.200" style="s2">games you mentioned one of them</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.600" end="00:32:00.799" style="s2">and i mean these these artworks are</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.200" end="00:32:03.039" style="s2">actually one of my favorites</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.799" end="00:32:04.399" style="s2">is this book that you co-authored with</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.039" end="00:32:06.880" style="s2">linda booth swinney the</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.399" end="00:32:08.960" style="s2">the systems thinking playbook um because</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.880" end="00:32:11.360" style="s2">again i think that these</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.960" end="00:32:12.960" style="s2">these games are technologies that change</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.360" end="00:32:14.720" style="s2">the way people think that book is a</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.960" end="00:32:17.279" style="s2">technology that changed</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.720" end="00:32:20.480" style="s2">the way people think so how on two</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.279" end="00:32:23.760" style="s2">levels in terms of creating</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.480" end="00:32:25.440" style="s2">systemic ecological literacy for people</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.760" end="00:32:29.200" style="s2">in place at the local level</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.440" end="00:32:30.799" style="s2">um through games like this um and</p>

<p begin="00:32:36.480" end="00:32:42.640" style="s2">right now seems like a rather bleak</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.399" end="00:32:45.360" style="s2">um assessment of where we&#39;re heading and</p>

<p begin="00:34:24.960" end="00:34:29.679" style="s2">uh and my answer in part was yes</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.000" end="00:34:31.280" style="s2">absolutely no problem actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.679" end="00:34:33.119" style="s2">for the vast majority of its entire</p>

<p begin="00:34:38.240" end="00:34:43.040" style="s2">rapid forward movement to being uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.359" end="00:34:45.119" style="s2">quiescent you know it&#39;s like riding a</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.040" end="00:34:46.320" style="s2">bicycle it&#39;s relatively easy to ride a</p>

<p begin="00:34:46.320" end="00:34:50.639" style="s2">and it&#39;s also relatively easy to stand</p>

<p begin="00:34:50.639" end="00:34:54.879" style="s2">still but to get from rapid forward</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.320" end="00:34:57.599" style="s2">movement</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.879" end="00:34:58.079" style="s2">to be dismounting and getting up that is</p>

<p begin="00:35:01.040" end="00:35:06.720" style="s2">can cause a lot of damage</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.520" end="00:35:07.040" style="s2">and that&#39;s what we face in our society</p>

<p begin="00:35:10.960" end="00:35:15.920" style="s2">or at the national level</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.480" end="00:35:17.680" style="s2">how to envision a future that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:35:17.680" end="00:35:23.359" style="s2">have growth in it growth</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.359" end="00:35:26.560" style="s2">plays an extremely important role</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.359" end="00:35:30.480" style="s2">politically and socially politically</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.560" end="00:35:32.640" style="s2">growth is lets politicians uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.480" end="00:35:33.680" style="s2">reach compromises which don&#39;t give</p>

<p begin="00:35:33.680" end="00:35:37.839" style="s2">because they can promise that they&#39;ll</p>

<p begin="00:35:38.800" end="00:35:45.200" style="s2">you know and as soon as you</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.560" end="00:35:47.280" style="s2">eliminate the promise of growth and it</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.200" end="00:35:48.720" style="s2">starts to look like a zero-sum game at</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.280" end="00:35:52.000" style="s2">which point</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.720" end="00:35:55.200" style="s2">uh democracies don&#39;t function very well</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.000" end="00:35:55.200" style="s2">actually i think it&#39;s one of the key</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.839" end="00:36:00.480" style="s2">problems facing western democracies at</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.160" end="00:36:04.560" style="s2">the moment real growth is by and large</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.480" end="00:36:04.880" style="s2">uh gone away and we&#39;re now in a position</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.560" end="00:36:08.160" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.880" end="00:36:10.800" style="s2">uh zero sum negotiations and</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.160" end="00:36:12.320" style="s2">uh it doesn&#39;t work very well uh under</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.800" end="00:36:15.359" style="s2">those circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.320" end="00:36:18.560" style="s2">so what can you do well uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.359" end="00:36:18.560" style="s2">let&#39;s start with population</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.800" end="00:36:22.160" style="s2">it seems as though fertility is</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.359" end="00:36:25.119" style="s2">declining</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.160" end="00:36:26.960" style="s2">certainly it is declining objectively in</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.119" end="00:36:30.160" style="s2">some nations</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.960" end="00:36:34.079" style="s2">china and japan</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.160" end="00:36:36.560" style="s2">are uh russia and others</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.079" end="00:36:38.240" style="s2">so that that&#39;s an objective fact rather</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.560" end="00:36:41.440" style="s2">than fight it</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.240" end="00:36:43.760" style="s2">by offering subsidies or you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.440" end="00:36:44.960" style="s2">banning uh birth control it would be</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.760" end="00:36:46.640" style="s2">useful for</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.960" end="00:36:49.520" style="s2">uh governments to start trying to</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.640" end="00:36:51.680" style="s2">understand how they can run a system</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.520" end="00:36:53.359" style="s2">in which the population isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.680" end="00:36:54.720" style="s2">continuously expanding</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.359" end="00:36:56.560" style="s2">in which you don&#39;t need more and more</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.720" end="00:36:58.880" style="s2">building stock in which tax revenues</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.560" end="00:37:00.560" style="s2">don&#39;t keep going up and up and up</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.880" end="00:37:02.480" style="s2">and which there&#39;s not a steady flow of</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.560" end="00:37:03.280" style="s2">young people to support the old people</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.480" end="00:37:04.720" style="s2">in their</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.280" end="00:37:06.880" style="s2">pensions and so forth a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.720" end="00:37:07.520" style="s2">interesting problems which could be</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.880" end="00:37:09.280" style="s2">addressed</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.520" end="00:37:11.119" style="s2">and uh would be it&#39;ll actually be very</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.280" end="00:37:13.359" style="s2">challenging</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.119" end="00:37:14.640" style="s2">until we have answers to those questions</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.359" end="00:37:18.560" style="s2">we&#39;re going to ignore</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.640" end="00:37:20.720" style="s2">the fact that we are overpopulated</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.560" end="00:37:23.040" style="s2">so one thing i would start with at the</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.720" end="00:37:25.599" style="s2">community level at the</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.040" end="00:37:26.480" style="s2">individual level at the national level</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.599" end="00:37:28.160" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.480" end="00:37:29.920" style="s2">start playing this thought experiment</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.160" end="00:37:32.400" style="s2">that growth is going to stop</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.920" end="00:37:33.680" style="s2">and that you need to fashion the society</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.400" end="00:37:35.440" style="s2">which can function</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.680" end="00:37:37.920" style="s2">uh within the constraints of serial</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.440" end="00:37:40.560" style="s2">growth there are solutions</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.920" end="00:37:41.680" style="s2">it&#39;s just that we haven&#39;t bothered to</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.560" end="00:37:44.000" style="s2">look for them</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.680" end="00:37:46.880" style="s2">that&#39;d be one thing at the local level</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.000" end="00:37:49.119" style="s2">this can be things like</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.880" end="00:37:50.640" style="s2">deciding what is an attractive</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.119" end="00:37:53.040" style="s2">population for your community</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.640" end="00:37:54.160" style="s2">and understanding you know how you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.040" end="00:37:57.440" style="s2">get there and then</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.160" end="00:38:00.320" style="s2">uh stay there uh at the</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.440" end="00:38:02.160" style="s2">national level it gets off into issues</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.320" end="00:38:05.200" style="s2">of tax revenue and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.160" end="00:38:06.720" style="s2">that&#39;s one thing to do uh another thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.200" end="00:38:10.079" style="s2">to do</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.720" end="00:38:12.800" style="s2">is uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.079" end="00:38:14.000" style="s2">to start imagining other indicators of</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.800" end="00:38:17.040" style="s2">success</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.000" end="00:38:20.320" style="s2">i&#39;ve been struck uh by the extent</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.040" end="00:38:24.320" style="s2">to which the swedish approach</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.320" end="00:38:26.880" style="s2">to the virus has been forced</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.320" end="00:38:28.240" style="s2">into the metric two metrics really</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.880" end="00:38:32.880" style="s2">number of deaths</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.240" end="00:38:36.960" style="s2">short term and uh gmp growth</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.880" end="00:38:38.400" style="s2">and people uh use those two numbers in</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.960" end="00:38:40.160" style="s2">comparison with</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.400" end="00:38:42.560" style="s2">those two numbers from other countries</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.160" end="00:38:43.520" style="s2">to decide whether or not they think the</p>

<p begin="00:38:43.520" end="00:38:48.560" style="s2">uh experiment was successful well</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.800" end="00:38:50.720" style="s2">leaving aside the fact that we&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.560" end="00:38:51.440" style="s2">in the early stages is it&#39;s epidemic so</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.720" end="00:38:53.280" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.440" end="00:38:55.359" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like trying to call a race</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.280" end="00:38:56.800" style="s2">a marathon on the basis of who&#39;s ahead</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.359" end="00:39:00.079" style="s2">after three minutes</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.800" end="00:39:03.440" style="s2">uh it&#39;s clearly in sweden</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.079" end="00:39:05.680" style="s2">there are many other factors going on uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.440" end="00:39:07.520" style="s2">to define the psychological social</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.680" end="00:39:09.440" style="s2">economic well-being</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.520" end="00:39:10.800" style="s2">of the people and uh we don&#39;t pay</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.440" end="00:39:12.720" style="s2">attention to them because we bylaws</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.800" end="00:39:14.480" style="s2">don&#39;t have indicators of them</p>

<p begin="00:39:14.480" end="00:39:17.119" style="s2">start trying to think through how they</p>

<p begin="00:39:17.119" end="00:39:23.119" style="s2">and gather record and report</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.400" end="00:39:26.480" style="s2">a somewhat more diverse set of</p>

<p begin="00:39:31.359" end="00:39:36.079" style="s2">you start to see very large uh varieties</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.800" end="00:39:39.440" style="s2">of gray then you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.079" end="00:39:42.320" style="s2">there are other options available too so</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.440" end="00:39:44.079" style="s2">you know i could go on but those two</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.320" end="00:39:46.000" style="s2">things one</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.079" end="00:39:47.520" style="s2">starting systematically to explore the</p>

<p begin="00:42:30.160" end="00:42:34.720" style="s2">i think it&#39;s about sixty percent of the</p>

<p begin="00:42:34.720" end="00:42:38.319" style="s2">actually have to share three percent of</p>

<p begin="00:42:45.280" end="00:42:53.520" style="s2">um so inequality um is a big issue</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.280" end="00:42:55.200" style="s2">here too well i&#39;m happy that a growing</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.520" end="00:42:58.000" style="s2">number of people are looking at</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.200" end="00:42:58.800" style="s2">to find alternative indicators uh you</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.000" end="00:43:00.800" style="s2">held up</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.800" end="00:43:02.720" style="s2">that book uh system thinking playbook</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.800" end="00:43:06.640" style="s2">one of the exercises in there</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.720" end="00:43:10.400" style="s2">is uh you know called frame that&#39;s as uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.640" end="00:43:14.560" style="s2">called um secret code</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.400" end="00:43:18.400" style="s2">and it um it shows how</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.560" end="00:43:21.040" style="s2">you look for solutions within the box</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.400" end="00:43:22.480" style="s2">and often the solutions we need aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.040" end="00:43:26.240" style="s2">inside that box you have to</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.480" end="00:43:27.280" style="s2">think outside the box and uh the system</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.240" end="00:43:29.200" style="s2">of ac</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.280" end="00:43:31.280" style="s2">indicators that we have now constitute a</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.200" end="00:43:34.160" style="s2">box they uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.280" end="00:43:35.520" style="s2">they define the problem and they are</p>

<p begin="00:43:38.720" end="00:43:42.640" style="s2">the really good responses uh don&#39;t show</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.040" end="00:43:44.000" style="s2">up very well with those indicators you</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.640" end="00:43:48.960" style="s2">need new indicators to</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.000" end="00:43:48.960" style="s2">to take you in in the right direction um</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.680" end="00:43:54.400" style="s2">coming back to this issue of growth yes</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.599" end="00:43:55.839" style="s2">our book uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.400" end="00:43:58.160" style="s2">could have been called the limits to</p>

<p begin="00:44:07.119" end="00:44:12.319" style="s2">uh and the point we made in there i</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.280" end="00:44:16.160" style="s2">think bears uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.319" end="00:44:18.480" style="s2">repeating physical growth is not going</p>

<p begin="00:44:24.000" end="00:44:28.640" style="s2">the question is that&#39;s of interest to us</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.640" end="00:44:32.400" style="s2">what will be the mechanisms that stop</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.640" end="00:44:33.839" style="s2">it will they be limitations that we</p>

<p begin="00:44:33.839" end="00:44:40.079" style="s2">and impose on ourself or will they</p>

<p begin="00:44:41.599" end="00:44:44.960" style="s2">to make this concrete let&#39;s take</p>

<p begin="00:44:44.960" end="00:44:50.880" style="s2">you know population grows when the birth</p>

<p begin="00:45:42.160" end="00:45:47.119" style="s2">and so forth and</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.280" end="00:45:49.599" style="s2">you know what you&#39;re asking really is</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.119" end="00:45:51.040" style="s2">will this growing</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.599" end="00:45:52.720" style="s2">group of people interested in</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.040" end="00:45:54.960" style="s2">alternatives</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.720" end="00:45:56.000" style="s2">rise up in numbers of power quickly</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.960" end="00:45:59.440" style="s2">enough</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.000" end="00:46:00.079" style="s2">to begin enforcing proactive limitations</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.440" end="00:46:03.119" style="s2">on the growth</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.079" end="00:46:05.040" style="s2">or will they be too late</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.119" end="00:46:06.400" style="s2">in which case we will just sit here and</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.040" end="00:46:10.240" style="s2">wait for</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.400" end="00:46:13.119" style="s2">uh nature uh to decide how it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.240" end="00:46:15.200" style="s2">limit our earth i mean there is an</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.119" end="00:46:15.760" style="s2">equality issue that is really central</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.200" end="00:46:19.280" style="s2">and i</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.760" end="00:46:19.680" style="s2">i personally of course i would agree</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.280" end="00:46:22.960" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.680" end="00:46:26.079" style="s2">um coming on to eight billion people</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.960" end="00:46:28.000" style="s2">is too many humans for the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.079" end="00:46:30.960" style="s2">carrying capacity of the planet and</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.000" end="00:46:32.000" style="s2">we&#39;ve pretty much as humanity been in</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.960" end="00:46:33.599" style="s2">overshoot</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.000" end="00:46:35.920" style="s2">since since i was born i was born in</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.599" end="00:46:36.560" style="s2">1971 and we went into overshoot just</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.920" end="00:46:39.599" style="s2">before that</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.560" end="00:46:41.200" style="s2">um but</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.599" end="00:46:43.119" style="s2">sometimes this conversation about</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.200" end="00:46:46.400" style="s2">there&#39;s just too many of us</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.119" end="00:46:48.640" style="s2">obscures the fact that it&#39;s really a</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.400" end="00:46:50.000" style="s2">as you alluded to like the winners of</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.640" end="00:46:53.119" style="s2">these crisis</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.000" end="00:46:56.319" style="s2">um are the over consuming</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.119" end="00:47:00.160" style="s2">10 that have</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.319" end="00:47:04.319" style="s2">the the large part of um the impact</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.160" end="00:47:08.319" style="s2">and um so so really the the uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.319" end="00:47:09.599" style="s2">way of equitably or re-addressing the</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.319" end="00:47:12.800" style="s2">inequity issue</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.599" end="00:47:15.599" style="s2">would be to um respond to this not</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.800" end="00:47:16.640" style="s2">like the population growth as you also</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.599" end="00:47:19.200" style="s2">alluded to</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.640" end="00:47:21.359" style="s2">is naturally beginning to seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.200" end="00:47:22.800" style="s2">seems to be slowing down if we</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.359" end="00:47:24.640" style="s2">engage in the measures you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.800" end="00:47:25.599" style="s2">like educating women and so on we can</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.640" end="00:47:28.160" style="s2">probably do it</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.599" end="00:47:30.319" style="s2">even faster but really it is about</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.160" end="00:47:33.040" style="s2">changing the patterns of consumption and</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.319" end="00:47:34.880" style="s2">a while ago i think when the 45th</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.040" end="00:47:36.240" style="s2">anniversary of limits to growth happens</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.880" end="00:47:38.160" style="s2">you were interviewed by somebody in</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.240" end="00:47:40.079" style="s2">german tv and they put out a little</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.160" end="00:47:41.359" style="s2">video that i watched yesterday and in it</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.079" end="00:47:45.280" style="s2">you also made the point that</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.359" end="00:47:46.960" style="s2">there&#39;s no no way that we can um avoid</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.280" end="00:47:48.559" style="s2">the i thought you mentioned the word</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.960" end="00:47:48.960" style="s2">collapse but you must use the different</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.559" end="00:47:52.640" style="s2">words</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.960" end="00:47:56.079" style="s2">breakdown or this is not continuing</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.640" end="00:47:57.599" style="s2">um and you then said the only way we</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.079" end="00:48:00.960" style="s2">have is</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.599" end="00:48:04.559" style="s2">a change of cultural and societal norms</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.960" end="00:48:04.559" style="s2">um but that seemed to me</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.839" end="00:48:08.640" style="s2">still leaving the door open that we</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.680" end="00:48:10.880" style="s2">could</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.640" end="00:48:12.559" style="s2">engender such a change of cultural and</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.880" end="00:48:15.599" style="s2">societal norms</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.559" end="00:48:18.079" style="s2">um are you are you hopeful that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.599" end="00:48:18.079" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.680" end="00:48:29.200" style="s2">it is possible is it likely</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.240" end="00:48:29.200" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a different one um</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.359" end="00:48:35.839" style="s2">you know i um</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.240" end="00:48:44.079" style="s2">so i think about these things a lot and</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.280" end="00:48:47.200" style="s2">uh you know i spent 50 years</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.079" end="00:48:50.480" style="s2">trying to help people understand uh</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.200" end="00:48:53.520" style="s2">their realistic options and and start uh</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.480" end="00:48:54.800" style="s2">choosing a bit more wisely for the long</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.520" end="00:48:57.680" style="s2">term</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.800" end="00:48:58.640" style="s2">i would say by and large i failed i i</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.680" end="00:49:01.760" style="s2">don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.640" end="00:49:02.480" style="s2">think the planet is going to evolve on</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.760" end="00:49:04.400" style="s2">of course</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.480" end="00:49:05.920" style="s2">any different from i having been around</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.400" end="00:49:10.400" style="s2">than it would have if</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.920" end="00:49:10.400" style="s2">i hadn&#39;t been conceived um</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.880" end="00:49:15.280" style="s2">anything is possible and of course many</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.520" end="00:49:18.880" style="s2">things will happen i mean</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.280" end="00:49:20.720" style="s2">the one of my sorrows is that i won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.880" end="00:49:22.960" style="s2">alive 100 years from now to see what</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.720" end="00:49:26.160" style="s2">things look like</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.960" end="00:49:26.880" style="s2">they will be very different than they</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.160" end="00:49:30.240" style="s2">are now</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.880" end="00:49:33.520" style="s2">i uh you know i remember i</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.240" end="00:49:36.240" style="s2">uh i gave uh i</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.520" end="00:49:36.880" style="s2">i&#39;ve given many speeches in vienna to uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.240" end="00:49:40.400" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.880" end="00:49:43.040" style="s2">groups and one of the things i&#39;ve uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.400" end="00:49:45.280" style="s2">often said to them starting already uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.040" end="00:49:47.680" style="s2">10 15 years ago was that</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.280" end="00:49:50.400" style="s2">the next 20 years we&#39;ll see more changes</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.680" end="00:49:52.720" style="s2">in their life than the last hundred</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.400" end="00:49:54.319" style="s2">and in the case of austria that&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.720" end="00:49:58.079" style="s2">difference because 100 years ago they</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.319" end="00:50:01.119" style="s2">were a monarchy and a large empire</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.079" end="00:50:02.240" style="s2">uh but i think uh it&#39;s true i mean if</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.119" end="00:50:04.720" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.240" end="00:50:06.160" style="s2">you just uh look at what&#39;s happened even</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.720" end="00:50:08.160" style="s2">over the last uh</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.160" end="00:50:10.000" style="s2">six months the the pace of change is</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.160" end="00:50:13.440" style="s2">astonishing</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.000" end="00:50:15.440" style="s2">so uh so when you ask me is it possible</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.440" end="00:50:18.000" style="s2">yes anything is possible</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.440" end="00:50:19.200" style="s2">uh will it be likely and will it be</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.000" end="00:50:22.720" style="s2">effective you know those</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.200" end="00:50:24.880" style="s2">that that remains to be seen i&#39;ve uh</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.720" end="00:50:26.319" style="s2">i&#39;ve been impressed by the extent that</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.880" end="00:50:28.160" style="s2">um things</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.319" end="00:50:30.079" style="s2">usually take longer than you expect them</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.160" end="00:50:33.119" style="s2">to at least the positive ones</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.079" end="00:50:36.800" style="s2">yeah and so</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.119" end="00:50:41.040" style="s2">um i don&#39;t ex i don&#39;t expect personally</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.800" end="00:50:42.800" style="s2">to be alive when that has happened</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.040" end="00:50:44.880" style="s2">did i ask you a question like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.800" end="00:50:46.800" style="s2">there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.880" end="00:50:48.720" style="s2">there&#39;s something like i&#39;ve learned a</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.800" end="00:50:50.319" style="s2">lot from the writings of your late</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.720" end="00:50:54.319" style="s2">ex-wife donella</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.319" end="00:50:56.240" style="s2">and um i always found it fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.319" end="00:50:58.640" style="s2">that there&#39;s a there&#39;s an article that</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.240" end="00:51:01.760" style="s2">gets quoted a lot that she wrote called</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.640" end="00:51:04.000" style="s2">um leverage points</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.760" end="00:51:05.040" style="s2">to change a system to intervene in a</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.000" end="00:51:06.880" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.040" end="00:51:08.079" style="s2">and what i find particularly interesting</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.880" end="00:51:08.800" style="s2">about this article is that i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.079" end="00:51:10.240" style="s2">discovered that</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.800" end="00:51:12.240" style="s2">there are two versions of the same</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.240" end="00:51:15.520" style="s2">article one that that you wrote</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.240" end="00:51:17.839" style="s2">significantly earlier where the leverage</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.520" end="00:51:19.680" style="s2">points stop at the higher highest</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.839" end="00:51:21.760" style="s2">leverage point being called</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.680" end="00:51:23.680" style="s2">at the level of the paradigm and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.760" end="00:51:24.559" style="s2">basically still within that framing of</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.680" end="00:51:27.680" style="s2">the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.559" end="00:51:28.640" style="s2">kunyan paradigm shift from from this to</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.680" end="00:51:31.680" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.640" end="00:51:33.280" style="s2">and and then um towards the end of her</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.680" end="00:51:35.760" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.280" end="00:51:37.119" style="s2">there&#39;s this other version that came out</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.760" end="00:51:39.520" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.119" end="00:51:41.040" style="s2">where the highest point is going beyond</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.520" end="00:51:45.119" style="s2">paradigms</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.040" end="00:51:48.160" style="s2">and then that was elaborated on</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.119" end="00:51:50.319" style="s2">in in a way in something that was</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.160" end="00:51:51.839" style="s2">published posthumously first in a</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.319" end="00:51:52.480" style="s2">journal i think it was whole earth or</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.839" end="00:51:55.599" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.480" end="00:51:57.520" style="s2">something um a little piece called</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.599" end="00:51:58.559" style="s2">dancing with systems that then also</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.520" end="00:52:01.040" style="s2">ended up in her</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.559" end="00:52:01.920" style="s2">um systems thinking book that that was</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.040" end="00:52:05.119" style="s2">published</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.920" end="00:52:06.880" style="s2">and when i sense there and that&#39;s i&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:55:06.240" end="00:55:12.480" style="s2">with the virus</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.960" end="00:55:14.319" style="s2">people are adjusting</p>

<p begin="00:55:24.240" end="00:55:28.160" style="s2">so part of this way of adjusting will be</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.680" end="00:55:31.200" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.160" end="00:55:33.440" style="s2">knowing and you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.200" end="00:55:34.720" style="s2">i keep coming back to this our species</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.440" end="00:55:36.559" style="s2">has been on this planet for several</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.720" end="00:55:39.680" style="s2">hundred thousand years</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.559" end="00:55:40.799" style="s2">i remember when i was little and so</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.680" end="00:55:43.599" style="s2">enthralled with</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.799" end="00:55:45.520" style="s2">uh modern science and modern knowledge i</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.599" end="00:55:46.799" style="s2">i more or less implicitly thought that</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.520" end="00:55:48.640" style="s2">for the first couple hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.799" end="00:55:50.160" style="s2">years people&#39;s head must have been empty</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.640" end="00:55:52.559" style="s2">because it didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.160" end="00:55:53.280" style="s2">all this wonderful knowledge in it you</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.559" end="00:55:56.079" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.280" end="00:55:56.799" style="s2">but of course that&#39;s not true uh in some</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.079" end="00:56:00.079" style="s2">ways</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.799" end="00:56:03.280" style="s2">uh those earlier examples of us</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.079" end="00:56:04.960" style="s2">were more sophisticated more nuanced and</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.280" end="00:56:08.079" style="s2">more complex</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.960" end="00:56:11.040" style="s2">than we are today they had to be because</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.079" end="00:56:11.040" style="s2">if they didn&#39;t uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.200" end="00:56:14.640" style="s2">have a very very subtle understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.200" end="00:56:17.680" style="s2">their environment they</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.640" end="00:56:20.319" style="s2">would die off uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.680" end="00:56:21.920" style="s2">much less a threat uh today so they had</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.319" end="00:56:25.359" style="s2">different ways of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.920" end="00:56:25.839" style="s2">uh those ways will come back they still</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.359" end="00:56:28.480" style="s2">exist</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.839" end="00:56:31.839" style="s2">in places and in aspects and they will</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.480" end="00:56:31.839" style="s2">be re-accentuated</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.240" end="00:56:39.680" style="s2">and so you you think that this this uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.799" end="00:56:40.559" style="s2">adding going beyond paradigms wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.680" end="00:56:44.559" style="s2">because i always</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.559" end="00:56:46.559" style="s2">took it as speaking to the the value of</p>

<p begin="00:56:55.280" end="00:56:59.760" style="s2">draw some insight from all of them and</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.280" end="00:57:00.799" style="s2">because any perspective will always have</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.760" end="00:57:03.440" style="s2">a blind spot</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.799" end="00:57:05.760" style="s2">to to basically make wiser decisions</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.440" end="00:57:08.240" style="s2">because we&#39;re not just drawing from one</p>

<p begin="00:58:53.920" end="00:58:59.599" style="s2">how would you</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.880" end="00:59:03.280" style="s2">how could you imagine um life</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.599" end="00:59:06.400" style="s2">to be like in 100 years for our</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.280" end="00:59:06.400" style="s2">future ancestors</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.599" end="00:59:14.240" style="s2">well i i speculate about that i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.760" end="00:59:15.359" style="s2">imagine that i have any great insights</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.240" end="00:59:16.839" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.359" end="00:59:18.880" style="s2">it&#39;s certainly not a matter of</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.839" end="00:59:20.880" style="s2">scientific</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.880" end="00:59:25.200" style="s2">discovery that leads me to these</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.880" end="00:59:25.200" style="s2">thoughts but 100 years from now</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.680" end="00:59:34.720" style="s2">the planet will have a climate</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.000" end="00:59:36.559" style="s2">very different from the one it has now</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.720" end="00:59:39.680" style="s2">similar to what it has had</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.559" end="00:59:42.000" style="s2">at times in the past and since</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.680" end="00:59:43.599" style="s2">our civilization our modes of</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.000" end="00:59:46.880" style="s2">agricultural production</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.599" end="00:59:50.839" style="s2">our ways of generating and using energy</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.880" end="00:59:54.079" style="s2">are so uh in</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.839" end="00:59:56.240" style="s2">intertwined with the climate</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.079" end="00:59:57.119" style="s2">the fact that the climate is changing</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.240" end="00:59:59.040" style="s2">means that</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.119" end="01:00:02.079" style="s2">those modes will change our civilization</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.040" end="01:00:04.240" style="s2">will be very different</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.079" end="01:00:05.839" style="s2">a hundred years from now than it is now</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.240" end="01:00:08.400" style="s2">population will be lower</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.839" end="01:00:10.240" style="s2">and my guess is that the modes of social</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.400" end="01:00:13.440" style="s2">organization</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.240" end="01:00:16.799" style="s2">will be much more local</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.440" end="01:00:20.079" style="s2">and i&#39;ll use the term uh despite its</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.799" end="01:00:22.240" style="s2">negative kind tribal you know it&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.079" end="01:00:25.119" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.240" end="01:00:26.000" style="s2">uh in the early days when i was</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.119" end="01:00:29.680" style="s2">advocating</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.000" end="01:00:31.839" style="s2">uh for change people uh</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.680" end="01:00:33.440" style="s2">change because uh the current policies</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.839" end="01:00:36.160" style="s2">are leading us</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.440" end="01:00:36.799" style="s2">uh in the wrong direction people would</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.160" end="01:00:39.359" style="s2">say well</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.799" end="01:00:40.960" style="s2">i i guess that means you&#39;re in favor of</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.359" end="01:00:42.079" style="s2">communism or you&#39;re in favor of a</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.960" end="01:00:44.880" style="s2">dictatorship</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.079" end="01:00:46.160" style="s2">if you don&#39;t like democracy and my</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.880" end="01:00:49.760" style="s2">response was you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.160" end="01:00:51.760" style="s2">in the 200 000 years that we have been</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.760" end="01:00:53.119" style="s2">on this planet we&#39;ve had many many</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.760" end="01:00:56.880" style="s2">different ways</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.119" end="01:01:01.359" style="s2">of organizing ourselves dictatorship</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.880" end="01:01:02.640" style="s2">and uh fascism and so forth these are</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.359" end="01:01:04.799" style="s2">some ways that we&#39;ve done we&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.640" end="01:01:06.880" style="s2">many other ways the way which has</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.799" end="01:01:08.799" style="s2">actually been most stable</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.880" end="01:01:10.160" style="s2">and existed over the longest period time</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.799" end="01:01:12.720" style="s2">is tribal</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.160" end="01:01:15.680" style="s2">uh you know a mechanism by which</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.720" end="01:01:19.760" style="s2">relatively small groups typically</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.680" end="01:01:23.440" style="s2">uh genetically interconnected</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.760" end="01:01:26.319" style="s2">collaborate and make decisions</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.440" end="01:01:26.640" style="s2">um so i i think that will come back you</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.319" end="01:01:28.400" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.640" end="01:01:30.079" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting to look at what</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.400" end="01:01:31.760" style="s2">happened in europe after the collapse of</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.079" end="01:01:34.400" style="s2">the roman empire</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.760" end="01:01:34.880" style="s2">there was four five hundred years where</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.400" end="01:01:38.000" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.880" end="01:01:41.119" style="s2">we went back to being uh mainly</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.000" end="01:01:43.200" style="s2">a city-state mechanism for</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.119" end="01:01:44.960" style="s2">organization before feudalism and</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.200" end="01:01:47.440" style="s2">monarchies and so forth</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.960" end="01:01:47.440" style="s2">emerged</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.319" end="01:01:53.839" style="s2">it it requires a mode of organization</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.960" end="01:01:57.920" style="s2">where people feel some identity</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.839" end="01:01:57.920" style="s2">with others the only</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.960" end="01:02:06.319" style="s2">thing uh your own perceived interest</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.799" end="01:02:08.240" style="s2">is if somehow a collective</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.319" end="01:02:09.599" style="s2">group that you identify with will be</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.240" end="01:02:12.559" style="s2">better off and</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.599" end="01:02:13.520" style="s2">uh you know one of one of the issues uh</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.559" end="01:02:16.960" style="s2">we confront</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.520" end="01:02:20.480" style="s2">today is uh</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.960" end="01:02:24.319" style="s2">that migration travel</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.480" end="01:02:27.520" style="s2">movements have broken down this sense</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.319" end="01:02:31.440" style="s2">of identification with others</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.520" end="01:02:33.359" style="s2">so i think probably that will re-emerge</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.440" end="01:02:34.640" style="s2">uh settlement patterns will be very</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.359" end="01:02:36.240" style="s2">different uh</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.640" end="01:02:39.200" style="s2">parts of the planet are now in the</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.240" end="01:02:42.319" style="s2">process of becoming uninhabitable</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.200" end="01:02:43.200" style="s2">it was 125 degrees in baghdad two days</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.319" end="01:02:46.240" style="s2">ago</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.200" end="01:02:47.119" style="s2">i can&#39;t imagine what it&#39;s like and of</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.240" end="01:02:50.720" style="s2">course</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.119" end="01:02:54.240" style="s2">soon it will be 130 degrees in baghdad</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.720" end="01:02:57.440" style="s2">and at roughly 135 degrees uh</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.240" end="01:03:00.480" style="s2">life is becomes impossible so uh parts</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.440" end="01:03:03.599" style="s2">of the planet because of temperature</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.480" end="01:03:06.000" style="s2">sea level rise uh declining moisture</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.599" end="01:03:09.119" style="s2">will become uninhabited</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.000" end="01:03:12.480" style="s2">my panels will differ uh</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.119" end="01:03:14.720" style="s2">i think we will move much closer back to</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.480" end="01:03:16.799" style="s2">a period where people are more</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.720" end="01:03:19.359" style="s2">responsible for producing the energy</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.799" end="01:03:21.119" style="s2">that they need uh in traditional</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.359" end="01:03:22.319" style="s2">societies roughly 80 percent of the</p>

<p begin="01:03:30.640" end="01:03:34.640" style="s2">uh in our society it&#39;s three or four</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.119" end="01:03:35.280" style="s2">percent of the people who are producing</p>

<p begin="01:03:38.799" end="01:03:42.559" style="s2">uh declined uh we&#39;re going to have to go</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.160" end="01:03:45.359" style="s2">back</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.559" end="01:03:45.760" style="s2">and work to using a variety of sunlight</p>

<p begin="01:03:47.920" end="01:03:52.720" style="s2">put more of us back in the role of</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.160" end="01:03:54.640" style="s2">producing you know these are sort of</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.720" end="01:03:55.280" style="s2">general speculations they don&#39;t get to</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.640" end="01:03:57.359" style="s2">the</p>

<p begin="01:05:41.920" end="01:05:46.160" style="s2">and suddenly uh solve all these problems</p>

<p begin="01:05:57.359" end="01:06:01.520" style="s2">actually the cause of the problem</p>

<p begin="01:06:01.520" end="01:06:05.039" style="s2">agree on that and</p>

<p begin="01:06:26.400" end="01:06:29.039" style="s2">was the response of the reef and the</p>

<p begin="01:06:29.039" end="01:06:33.039" style="s2">was the atmospheric composition in in</p>

<p begin="01:06:59.200" end="01:07:05.119" style="s2">they really biosphere 2 gave us</p>

<p begin="01:07:22.400" end="01:07:27.599" style="s2">yeah for me that that</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.599" end="01:07:29.920" style="s2">lesson is is one that we still haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.599" end="01:07:32.160" style="s2">fully learned yet people still believe</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.920" end="01:07:33.280" style="s2">that um we have all these amazing high</p>

<p begin="01:07:33.280" end="01:07:37.119" style="s2">really compared to what the technology</p>

<p begin="01:07:37.119" end="01:07:44.799" style="s2">achieves it their their</p>

<p begin="01:07:52.559" end="01:07:56.559" style="s2">relevant here</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.359" end="01:08:00.559" style="s2">um some</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.559" end="01:08:02.720" style="s2">systems that we build must be</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.559" end="01:08:04.640" style="s2">fail safe you know when you build a</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.720" end="01:08:06.720" style="s2">nuclear reactor</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.640" end="01:08:08.559" style="s2">the consequences of failure are so</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.720" end="01:08:09.440" style="s2">horrendous that you have to say to</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.559" end="01:08:13.039" style="s2">yourself it is</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.440" end="01:08:17.920" style="s2">fail-safe it cannot fail certainly</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.039" end="01:08:21.199" style="s2">a space station which is going to house</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.920" end="01:08:22.960" style="s2">these people has to be fail-safe because</p>

<p begin="01:08:22.960" end="01:08:26.480" style="s2">makes a mistake you you don&#39;t have a</p>

<p begin="01:08:26.480" end="01:08:31.759" style="s2">and amrey has pointed out uh as</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.679" end="01:08:33.279" style="s2">and there&#39;s of course uh enormous</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.759" end="01:08:36.319" style="s2">empirical evidence for this</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.279" end="01:08:38.080" style="s2">you can&#39;t build plc systems so</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.319" end="01:08:39.920" style="s2">it is simply outside the capacity of</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.080" end="01:08:41.759" style="s2">humanity to design</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.920" end="01:08:44.319" style="s2">a complex system that is feel safe and</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.759" end="01:08:48.400" style="s2">so rather than try to do that</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.319" end="01:08:52.319" style="s2">you need design systems which fail</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.400" end="01:08:54.880" style="s2">safely where you can have mistakes</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.319" end="01:08:56.880" style="s2">and although they are cause problems</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.880" end="01:08:58.319" style="s2">they don&#39;t cause catastrophe</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.880" end="01:09:01.759" style="s2">and they become the basis for learning</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.319" end="01:09:01.759" style="s2">how to do it better</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.839" end="01:09:06.000" style="s2">you asked what can we do well another</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.440" end="01:09:08.080" style="s2">thing we can</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.000" end="01:09:10.239" style="s2">do is to begin looking around at the</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.080" end="01:09:13.600" style="s2">systems we depend on</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.239" end="01:09:16.480" style="s2">and ask how we can</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.600" end="01:09:18.239" style="s2">design them in a way that lets them fail</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.480" end="01:09:21.839" style="s2">safely</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.239" end="01:09:21.839" style="s2">because they are going to fail</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.880" end="01:09:29.279" style="s2">i mean earlier you said that um</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.159" end="01:09:31.759" style="s2">we either can get happy by um</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.279" end="01:09:33.679" style="s2">well basically how do you say it again</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.759" end="01:09:36.880" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.679" end="01:09:38.640" style="s2">liking what we get or um if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.880" end="01:09:41.839" style="s2">get what you want what will you get</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.640" end="01:09:44.880" style="s2">yeah what you get um for me that</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.839" end="01:09:47.120" style="s2">deep her insight and also hearing you</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.880" end="01:09:48.319" style="s2">really it inspired me for for many many</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.120" end="01:09:50.799" style="s2">years and you</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.319" end="01:09:51.359" style="s2">many other people around the world same</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.799" end="01:09:54.719" style="s2">as you did</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.359" end="01:09:56.880" style="s2">earlier but you you don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.719" end="01:09:58.880" style="s2">your 50 years of ringing your alarm bell</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.880" end="01:10:02.000" style="s2">and 30 years of trying to</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.880" end="01:10:04.800" style="s2">get people to take different</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.000" end="01:10:05.440" style="s2">paths will have had a long-term effect</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.800" end="01:10:11.120" style="s2">um it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.440" end="01:10:14.560" style="s2">somewhat making me reflect on</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.120" end="01:10:16.719" style="s2">how do i spend my time um do you feel</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.560" end="01:10:19.280" style="s2">like having spent your time this way</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.719" end="01:10:20.239" style="s2">um do you do you regret some of it what</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.280" end="01:10:22.719" style="s2">would you have done</p>

<p begin="01:13:07.520" end="01:13:10.719" style="s2">what might still be possible i often</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.679" end="01:13:14.640" style="s2">when i give talks</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.719" end="01:13:16.159" style="s2">end with with a quote um that</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.640" end="01:13:18.719" style="s2">we&#39;re now at a point where we have to do</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.159" end="01:13:21.280" style="s2">the impossible because</p>

<p begin="01:13:31.679" end="01:13:36.159" style="s2">and holding both possibilities lightly</p>
