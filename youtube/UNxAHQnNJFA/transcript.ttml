<p begin="00:00:00.560" end="00:00:06.000" style="s2">good morning today&#39;s video is my</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.600" end="00:00:07.500" style="s2">response to the video I watched this</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.000" end="00:00:09.769" style="s2">morning which was Richard Wolf&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.500" end="00:00:13.110" style="s2">economic update this one in particular</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.769" end="00:00:14.700" style="s2">reparations and forgiving student debts</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.110" end="00:00:16.350" style="s2">which he talks about in there because</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.700" end="00:00:18.210" style="s2">this is not anything about actually</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.350" end="00:00:21.510" style="s2">reparations or student debt he talks</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.210" end="00:00:22.949" style="s2">about uber and how Ober CEO makes a ton</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.510" end="00:00:25.619" style="s2">of money and of course the workers don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.949" end="00:00:27.660" style="s2">his solution for the economy is to</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.619" end="00:00:29.789" style="s2">create an economy for the u.s. that is</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.660" end="00:00:31.590" style="s2">all worker cooperatives I believe</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.789" end="00:00:33.899" style="s2">changing the law because I can&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.590" end="00:00:36.090" style="s2">happening at any other way where every</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.899" end="00:00:39.300" style="s2">workplace has to be a democratic worker</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.090" end="00:00:42.210" style="s2">cooperative I&#39;ve done videos before I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.300" end="00:00:43.980" style="s2">why that&#39;s not a feasible solution it</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.210" end="00:00:45.570" style="s2">takes way too much to implement it as</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.980" end="00:00:46.980" style="s2">well as even when it&#39;s implemented</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.570" end="00:00:49.710" style="s2">they&#39;re still competing against each</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.980" end="00:00:51.300" style="s2">other so it&#39;s not actually efficient and</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.710" end="00:00:56.070" style="s2">I&#39;m going to showcase that with the uber</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.300" end="00:00:58.850" style="s2">example so let&#39;s say after a lot of toil</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.070" end="00:01:01.469" style="s2">and labor we get those laws passed and</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.850" end="00:01:04.409" style="s2">or you because I&#39;m kind of American you</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.469" end="00:01:06.630" style="s2">get those laws passed and now the people</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.409" end="00:01:09.180" style="s2">who work for uber and lyft own uber and</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.630" end="00:01:11.369" style="s2">lyft they now are still in competition</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.180" end="00:01:13.830" style="s2">with each other so they decide in their</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.369" end="00:01:16.590" style="s2">workplace that they want to make $25 an</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.830" end="00:01:19.740" style="s2">hour&#39;s they each make $25 an hour they</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.590" end="00:01:23.520" style="s2">were working for $12 an hour under the</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.740" end="00:01:26.189" style="s2">old system in uber and lyft so they</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.520" end="00:01:27.479" style="s2">slowly though vote their way down to $12</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.189" end="00:01:30.810" style="s2">an hour because they were willing to</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.479" end="00:01:32.820" style="s2">work for $12 an hour and the consumer</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.810" end="00:01:35.880" style="s2">was willing and there is still in</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.820" end="00:01:37.350" style="s2">competition with each other and if one</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.880" end="00:01:40.290" style="s2">of them is willing to work for 24 or 15</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.350" end="00:01:41.880" style="s2">of those 24 35 50 3350 they eventually</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.290" end="00:01:43.380" style="s2">get down to the point with like oh this</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.880" end="00:01:46.229" style="s2">is the lowest we can go or we&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.380" end="00:01:47.610" style="s2">able to pay for ourselves because</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.229" end="00:01:50.970" style="s2">they&#39;re in competition with each other</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.610" end="00:01:53.280" style="s2">so you&#39;d have to also pass a clause in</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.970" end="00:01:55.170" style="s2">they were like there&#39;s one car driving</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.280" end="00:01:57.320" style="s2">company and then they set the rate and</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.170" end="00:02:00.420" style="s2">then consumers choose to use them or not</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.320" end="00:02:04.200" style="s2">they also under that system would never</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.420" end="00:02:05.579" style="s2">vote to automotive eeeh khals autonomous</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.200" end="00:02:07.229" style="s2">vehicles would take away from their jobs</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.579" end="00:02:10.590" style="s2">so they wouldn&#39;t want that they&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.229" end="00:02:12.760" style="s2">vote to maintain their work we&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.590" end="00:02:15.400" style="s2">new world where</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.760" end="00:02:21.030" style="s2">things can be automated as well as with</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.400" end="00:02:22.900" style="s2">globalization they the workplace</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.030" end="00:02:24.760" style="s2">cooperative would have been a great</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.900" end="00:02:27.640" style="s2">solution in the 70s and 80s it&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.760" end="00:02:30.459" style="s2">longer a great solution although if</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.640" end="00:02:33.010" style="s2">there is a worker cooperative user and</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.459" end="00:02:34.810" style="s2">lift I will use it in my city I agree</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.010" end="00:02:36.790" style="s2">more with using that and supporting</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.810" end="00:02:38.560" style="s2">paying them a living wage because the</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.790" end="00:02:40.599" style="s2">truth is they could absolutely compete</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.560" end="00:02:42.640" style="s2">with lifting and uber if we knew when a</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.599" end="00:02:45.609" style="s2">worker cooperative was and wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.640" end="00:02:47.920" style="s2">give them our values because they would</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.609" end="00:02:49.720" style="s2">vote to pay 25 dollars an hour we were</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.920" end="00:02:52.060" style="s2">do we either use or were already paying</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.720" end="00:02:55.239" style="s2">twenty five dollars an hour but instead</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.060" end="00:02:56.620" style="s2">of 50% of that or 30% of that going to</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.239" end="00:02:58.030" style="s2">to Eber and they still have to maintain</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.620" end="00:03:00.790" style="s2">their vehicle and so they end up getting</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.030" end="00:03:04.569" style="s2">only $12 an hour we would vote that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.790" end="00:03:07.629" style="s2">vast majority goes directly to thee to</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.569" end="00:03:10.389" style="s2">the driver so that we can use a system</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.629" end="00:03:12.430" style="s2">that is more equitable but that is why</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.389" end="00:03:16.000" style="s2">consumer cooperative is the answer for</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.430" end="00:03:18.790" style="s2">basically everything because a consumer</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.000" end="00:03:20.650" style="s2">cooperative overnight we don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.790" end="00:03:22.389" style="s2">wait to change the laws we can just come</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.650" end="00:03:23.560" style="s2">together in a city that is that allows</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.389" end="00:03:27.760" style="s2">super and left already</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.560" end="00:03:29.739" style="s2">Vancouver&#39;s not that city and get 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.760" end="00:03:32.500" style="s2">people together who use it and say okay</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.739" end="00:03:34.239" style="s2">well let&#39;s not have that money go to</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.500" end="00:03:36.940" style="s2">shareholders let&#39;s create our own</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.239" end="00:03:39.129" style="s2">platform because uber doesn&#39;t own cars</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.940" end="00:03:41.109" style="s2">they don&#39;t have driver employees they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.129" end="00:03:43.690" style="s2">only contractors they don&#39;t actually own</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.109" end="00:03:46.569" style="s2">anything proprietary we can recreate a</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.690" end="00:03:48.609" style="s2">platform that meets our needs that is as</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.569" end="00:03:51.129" style="s2">a female has a female driver if I want</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.609" end="00:03:53.019" style="s2">that enduring surge pricing is going to</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.129" end="00:03:55.629" style="s2">keep more drivers on the car on the road</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.019" end="00:03:57.159" style="s2">so we can get home as well as hey I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.629" end="00:03:59.109" style="s2">going home from this concert I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.159" end="00:04:01.239" style="s2">to this location in my neighborhood are</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.109" end="00:04:03.340" style="s2">there other drivers that us or other</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.239" end="00:04:06.129" style="s2">riders that also want to come so that I</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.340" end="00:04:08.230" style="s2">can pay less and the driver themselves</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.129" end="00:04:11.220" style="s2">can still make a beyond living wage</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.230" end="00:04:14.760" style="s2">especially of going during surge pricing</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.220" end="00:04:16.110" style="s2">we can create solutions okay so so where</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.760" end="00:04:17.640" style="s2">is all that money going for the worker</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.110" end="00:04:19.230" style="s2">it&#39;s go a lot of it&#39;s going to car</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.640" end="00:04:21.870" style="s2">maintenance well can we both buy fuel</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.230" end="00:04:25.200" style="s2">fuel I don&#39;t know can we can we have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.870" end="00:04:27.180" style="s2">car mechanic that we have vehicles that</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.200" end="00:04:29.220" style="s2">are loaned out can we have like what</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.180" end="00:04:30.960" style="s2">system can we create that actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.220" end="00:04:33.480" style="s2">solves all of the problems so more money</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.960" end="00:04:36.510" style="s2">is going to the labor and the worker and</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.480" end="00:04:38.220" style="s2">we the user would absolutely vote to</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.510" end="00:04:40.020" style="s2">have autonomous vehicles because that</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.220" end="00:04:43.220" style="s2">would solve a lot of our problems and</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.020" end="00:04:46.050" style="s2">when we create an economy where</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.220" end="00:04:48.510" style="s2">automation doesn&#39;t mean starvation where</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.050" end="00:04:49.590" style="s2">everyone&#39;s needs are met then we want to</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.510" end="00:04:52.110" style="s2">automate because it means there&#39;s less</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.590" end="00:04:54.270" style="s2">human labor involved and more time to</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.110" end="00:04:55.440" style="s2">enjoy everything in life we don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.270" end="00:04:57.720" style="s2">users on the road we don&#39;t need a</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.440" end="00:04:59.520" style="s2">piecemeal economy but as long as we have</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.720" end="00:05:01.920" style="s2">a piecemeal economy we might as well own</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.520" end="00:05:04.290" style="s2">it together and use it together and</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.920" end="00:05:06.240" style="s2">recreate it with the user base in mind</p>
