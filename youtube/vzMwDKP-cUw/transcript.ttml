<p begin="00:00:04.130" end="00:00:09.570" style="s2">you&#39;ve known Jordan Peterson since</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.080" end="00:00:12.059" style="s2">before kind of at all of the rest of us</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.570" end="00:00:13.889" style="s2">kind of got to know him I guess yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.059" end="00:00:17.270" style="s2">was a strange he was a kind of strange</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.889" end="00:00:21.180" style="s2">coincidence of events I met him in 2015</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.270" end="00:00:24.240" style="s2">or I I heard of him in 2015 and then I I</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.180" end="00:00:27.119" style="s2">connected with him about six months</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.240" end="00:00:30.630" style="s2">before the whole thing started to kind</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.119" end="00:00:33.750" style="s2">of fall apart explode and my it was</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.630" end="00:00:36.450" style="s2">trained because when I met him when I</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.750" end="00:00:38.100" style="s2">heard him I felt like IKEA he understood</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.450" end="00:00:39.660" style="s2">the types of things that I was asking</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.100" end="00:00:43.920" style="s2">myself like the types of questions about</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.660" end="00:00:46.469" style="s2">how reality exists and about symbolism</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.920" end="00:00:48.030" style="s2">and so when we met I felt like there was</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.469" end="00:00:50.579" style="s2">one thing I had to tell him it was so</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.030" end="00:00:52.230" style="s2">weird because we we right away we could</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.579" end="00:00:55.050" style="s2">see that we could we could understand</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.230" end="00:00:56.309" style="s2">each other and there was I just felt</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.050" end="00:00:58.379" style="s2">like there was one message I needed to</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.309" end="00:00:59.940" style="s2">communicate to him which was because he</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.379" end="00:01:01.350" style="s2">talked about this notion of the monster</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.940" end="00:01:03.539" style="s2">on the edge of the world and the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.350" end="00:01:07.860" style="s2">the dragon and chaos kind of on the edge</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.539" end="00:01:10.110" style="s2">of reality but III I felt like I had to</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.860" end="00:01:12.810" style="s2">kind of tell them that that monster also</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.110" end="00:01:14.340" style="s2">exists between categories like it so</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.810" end="00:01:15.900" style="s2">it&#39;s not just that it exists on the edge</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.340" end="00:01:18.270" style="s2">of something but that the world exists</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.900" end="00:01:21.390" style="s2">in this hierarchy of levels let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.270" end="00:01:23.640" style="s2">and at the edge of each rung of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.390" end="00:01:27.810" style="s2">hierarchy or also in between opposites</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.640" end="00:01:30.420" style="s2">there is a buffer of of chaos and which</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.810" end="00:01:32.430" style="s2">kind of protects the which both which</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.420" end="00:01:35.340" style="s2">can both threaten but also protects the</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.430" end="00:01:38.460" style="s2">integrity of identities right so you</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.340" end="00:01:42.150" style="s2">need a kind of a buffer of exceptions a</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.460" end="00:01:43.979" style="s2">buffer of things that don&#39;t quite fit on</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.150" end="00:01:45.600" style="s2">the edges of things because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.979" end="00:01:47.369" style="s2">that&#39;s what helps you kind of like we</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.600" end="00:01:50.100" style="s2">say the exception is the rule right it</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.369" end="00:01:51.689" style="s2">helps you to see the identity but it it</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.100" end="00:01:54.270" style="s2">if you&#39;re not careful it can actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.689" end="00:01:55.290" style="s2">start to eat at the the identities and</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.270" end="00:01:57.270" style="s2">so I was trying to explain like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.290" end="00:01:59.340" style="s2">what that&#39;s why we have cherubim you</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.270" end="00:02:01.049" style="s2">know in the temple between the holy</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.340" end="00:02:02.759" style="s2">place and the Holy of Holies in the holy</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.049" end="00:02:04.950" style="s2">and that&#39;s why we have we have</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.759" end="00:02:07.710" style="s2">guardians on the outside of holy places</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.950" end="00:02:10.800" style="s2">right that act as this kind of buffer of</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.710" end="00:02:13.980" style="s2">chaos and we talked about also the idea</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.800" end="00:02:15.810" style="s2">of the the threshold</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.980" end="00:02:17.730" style="s2">in a lot of cultures you&#39;re not supposed</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.810" end="00:02:19.680" style="s2">to step on the threshold if you if you</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.730" end="00:02:21.540" style="s2">enter someone&#39;s house you have to step</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.680" end="00:02:23.790" style="s2">over the threshold like the step on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.540" end="00:02:25.470" style="s2">threshold is that is considered a very</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.790" end="00:02:27.930" style="s2">dangerous thing and it has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.470" end="00:02:29.280" style="s2">this idea that there is no definite</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.930" end="00:02:32.040" style="s2">place where the inside and the outside</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.280" end="00:02:34.590" style="s2">of an of a house is right you couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.040" end="00:02:36.060" style="s2">say right here like this spot where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.590" end="00:02:38.069" style="s2">showing this is exactly the place where</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.060" end="00:02:40.019" style="s2">the house house and the outside and</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.069" end="00:02:42.360" style="s2">inside are because it&#39;s not something</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.019" end="00:02:45.150" style="s2">about quantifiable it&#39;s not quantifiable</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.360" end="00:02:47.370" style="s2">but there is a difference and so the</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.150" end="00:02:50.280" style="s2">threshold acts as this buffer of chaos</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.370" end="00:02:52.890" style="s2">which is neither inside or outside don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.280" end="00:02:55.170" style="s2">touch it leave it alone you know let the</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.890" end="00:02:56.970" style="s2">monster be just just step across it and</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.170" end="00:02:58.380" style="s2">then you&#39;re on the inside and you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.970" end="00:03:00.120" style="s2">you&#39;re on the inside so that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.380" end="00:03:01.829" style="s2">kind of felt like I had to talk to him</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.120" end="00:03:03.840" style="s2">about and Jenny was so strange that it</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.829" end="00:03:07.290" style="s2">was that it ended up being this this</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.840" end="00:03:09.599" style="s2">like idea of identities that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.290" end="00:03:11.700" style="s2">quite don&#39;t quite fit into the normal</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.599" end="00:03:14.220" style="s2">male outfield female opposite that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.700" end="00:03:16.319" style="s2">what exploded on the first show exactly</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.220" end="00:03:18.650" style="s2">and so he ended up well it&#39;s more that</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.319" end="00:03:21.750" style="s2">the threshold started to manifest itself</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.650" end="00:03:23.459" style="s2">like it&#39;s like the monsters which are in</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.750" end="00:03:25.739" style="s2">a way supposed to protect the identities</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.459" end="00:03:28.260" style="s2">such a turn on the inside has started to</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.739" end="00:03:30.389" style="s2">devour the categories you know you see</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.260" end="00:03:32.670" style="s2">that in a lot of stories where like I</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.389" end="00:03:34.319" style="s2">talked about the idea of the troll in</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.670" end="00:03:36.870" style="s2">the bridge right so the troll on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.319" end="00:03:39.060" style="s2">bridge he protects he stops you from</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.870" end="00:03:41.040" style="s2">crossing right he&#39;s there to prevent</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.060" end="00:03:43.079" style="s2">things that aren&#39;t supposed to cross the</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.040" end="00:03:44.370" style="s2">cross but then he can also start to give</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.079" end="00:03:46.620" style="s2">how&#39;re things like he can start to</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.370" end="00:03:49.319" style="s2">actually eat at those things that want</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.620" end="00:03:51.540" style="s2">to cross over and so it&#39;s a it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.319" end="00:03:53.160" style="s2">that&#39;s the ambiguity of the of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.540" end="00:03:55.470" style="s2">margin so anyway so I felt like I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.160" end="00:03:57.959" style="s2">explained that so then after that when</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.470" end="00:03:59.730" style="s2">the Pepe thing kind of came about then I</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.959" end="00:04:02.790" style="s2">knew that okay we need to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.730" end="00:04:05.670" style="s2">this and then since then like I feel I</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.790" end="00:04:07.349" style="s2">feel like Jordan he kind of he&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.670" end="00:04:08.880" style="s2">seen me as an ally in certain things</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.349" end="00:04:10.650" style="s2">like not everything that he does but in</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.880" end="00:04:13.410" style="s2">certain things that he does and so he&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.650" end="00:04:15.359" style="s2">call me usually very frantic you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.410" end="00:04:17.160" style="s2">because he he thought of some crazy</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.359" end="00:04:18.599" style="s2">connection and he can&#39;t you couldn&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.160" end="00:04:20.250" style="s2">publicly because it would just look</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.599" end="00:04:21.810" style="s2">insane if you just said it publicly but</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.250" end="00:04:23.940" style="s2">you just need someone to bounce it off</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.810" end="00:04:25.380" style="s2">and so then we&#39;ll talk it out and and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.940" end="00:04:26.430" style="s2">so that&#39;s kind of been my my</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.380" end="00:04:27.660" style="s2">relationship with Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.430" end="00:04:29.430" style="s2">so when</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.660" end="00:04:31.620" style="s2">you explain that thing to him was this</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.430" end="00:04:34.770" style="s2">something he had thought of before or</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.620" end="00:04:36.060" style="s2">was it completely new I think it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.770" end="00:04:38.460" style="s2">of those things where he hadn&#39;t thought</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.060" end="00:04:40.830" style="s2">about it explicitly but as soon as I</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.460" end="00:04:42.480" style="s2">said it it was like right he clicked</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.830" end="00:04:44.730" style="s2">right away it fit right away into the</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.480" end="00:04:46.170" style="s2">way he sees the world and and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.730" end="00:04:47.550" style="s2">kind of I think that&#39;s what happens with</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.170" end="00:04:49.530" style="s2">symbolism to some of the things that he</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.550" end="00:04:50.820" style="s2">says it does the same to me where I</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.530" end="00:04:53.190" style="s2">hadn&#39;t quite thought of it in those</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.820" end="00:04:54.810" style="s2">categories but as soon as he says it it</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.190" end="00:04:56.370" style="s2">just kind of right away you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.810" end="00:04:57.390" style="s2">intuitively that it&#39;s right and so that</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.370" end="00:04:59.130" style="s2">was the that was kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.390" end="00:05:01.650" style="s2">relationship that they developed right</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.130" end="00:05:03.450" style="s2">away and then after that it felt like</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.650" end="00:05:04.950" style="s2">that&#39;s always been kind of our</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.450" end="00:05:06.210" style="s2">discussion is that he&#39;ll say something</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.950" end="00:05:08.100" style="s2">then I&#39;ll say something we&#39;re both kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.210" end="00:05:10.020" style="s2">of like whoa you know look like two</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.100" end="00:05:12.600" style="s2">stoners you know kind of discovering the</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.020" end="00:05:14.910" style="s2">the world and so it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.600" end="00:05:17.160" style="s2">fun that&#39;s for sure yeah so that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.910" end="00:05:19.080" style="s2">that&#39;s and then when it happened I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.160" end="00:05:21.840" style="s2">obviously when it happened to him then</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.080" end="00:05:23.820" style="s2">it really became real you know and so he</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.840" end="00:05:28.650" style="s2">started to see this whole idea of the of</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.820" end="00:05:30.090" style="s2">chaos in that way as a the idea of also</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.650" end="00:05:33.000" style="s2">this notion of deconstructing like how</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.090" end="00:05:34.530" style="s2">post-modernism also plays a role that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.000" end="00:05:34.980" style="s2">similar because that&#39;s what Jacques</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.530" end="00:05:37.790" style="s2">Derrida</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.980" end="00:05:41.430" style="s2">that&#39;s all he talked about was how these</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.790" end="00:05:43.890" style="s2">indeterminate categories they can</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.430" end="00:05:45.870" style="s2">deconstruct the categories if you play</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.890" end="00:05:49.020" style="s2">with them in the right way they can turn</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.870" end="00:05:53.010" style="s2">on normal opposites and-and-and actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.020" end="00:05:55.169" style="s2">kind of not invalidate but like make the</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.010" end="00:05:56.850" style="s2">normal category start to slip and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.169" end="00:05:58.560" style="s2">you can&#39;t nothing nothing is stable</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.850" end="00:06:00.540" style="s2">anymore that&#39;s good that&#39;s kind of how</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.560" end="00:06:02.190" style="s2">we feel like things are going on right</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.540" end="00:06:05.520" style="s2">now like the world is kind of in that</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.190" end="00:06:07.050" style="s2">that weird space right now so I wonder</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.520" end="00:06:09.419" style="s2">if there&#39;s some of the ambivalence that</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.050" end="00:06:12.090" style="s2">I see and sense with Christians and</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.419" end="00:06:15.300" style="s2">Jordan Peterson because one he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.090" end="00:06:18.180" style="s2">identify himself as a Christian but he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.300" end="00:06:19.740" style="s2">also explaining Christian stories in a</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.180" end="00:06:22.820" style="s2">way sort of using the psychological</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.740" end="00:06:26.190" style="s2">mainly is there a sense that in a way</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.820" end="00:06:28.740" style="s2">he&#39;s he&#39;s sort of potentially explaining</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.190" end="00:06:30.780" style="s2">them away for some Christians like in a</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.740" end="00:06:33.560" style="s2">way if you&#39;ve explained them why do you</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.780" end="00:06:35.700" style="s2">need belief and faith in the same way</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.560" end="00:06:37.470" style="s2">how do you how do you see the the</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.700" end="00:06:39.090" style="s2">relationship between sort of traditional</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.470" end="00:06:41.610" style="s2">Christianity and what Jordan Peterson is</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.090" end="00:06:44.520" style="s2">offering yeah I think I keep</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.610" end="00:06:46.110" style="s2">thing is obviously not a Christian like</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.520" end="00:06:48.569" style="s2">I even said like Jordan is obviously a</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.110" end="00:06:51.870" style="s2">heretic like he&#39;s a lot of the things he</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.569" end="00:06:54.210" style="s2">says are completely wild but I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.870" end="00:06:56.129" style="s2">that I think that the way that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.210" end="00:06:58.409" style="s2">talking about things I think the way</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.129" end="00:07:00.870" style="s2">that he&#39;s talking about about these</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.409" end="00:07:03.689" style="s2">stories first of all it&#39;s not that new</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.870" end="00:07:07.909" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s only new it&#39;s only new for</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.689" end="00:07:10.199" style="s2">kind of weird literalists type</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.909" end="00:07:12.449" style="s2">Christians in the United States and in</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.199" end="00:07:14.219" style="s2">North America especially but it but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.449" end="00:07:16.080" style="s2">not weird at all for traditional</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.219" end="00:07:17.430" style="s2">Christians because this idea that there</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.080" end="00:07:18.930" style="s2">are first of all different levels of</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.430" end="00:07:22.169" style="s2">meaning in the text is very traditional</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.930" end="00:07:27.060" style="s2">and so this notion also that the the Old</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.169" end="00:07:29.610" style="s2">Testament is there to show us certain</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.060" end="00:07:31.319" style="s2">moral structure than kind of ways of</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.610" end="00:07:33.539" style="s2">interacting that can teach us lessons</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.319" end="00:07:35.789" style="s2">about how to live our lives I mean</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.539" end="00:07:37.319" style="s2">that&#39;s obviously very that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.789" end="00:07:39.620" style="s2">traditional I think that Jordan has</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.319" end="00:07:42.150" style="s2">found a way to talk about it using</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.620" end="00:07:44.159" style="s2">neuropsychology using the psychology of</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.150" end="00:07:46.800" style="s2">attention using also evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.159" end="00:07:49.020" style="s2">biology that is definitely surprising</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.800" end="00:07:52.500" style="s2">people because he&#39;s able to connect you</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.020" end="00:07:54.120" style="s2">know research in psychology to to to how</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.500" end="00:07:55.740" style="s2">the stories lay that some play</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.120" end="00:07:58.110" style="s2">themselves out and I think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.740" end="00:08:01.229" style="s2">been really fascinating for people um</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.110" end="00:08:02.639" style="s2">and and I think what I&#39;ve always said is</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.229" end="00:08:05.729" style="s2">I think that the fact that Jordan is not</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.639" end="00:08:08.250" style="s2">Christian is actually extremely helpful</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.729" end="00:08:10.680" style="s2">right now because would start listening</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.250" end="00:08:14.279" style="s2">to the media said that he was yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.680" end="00:08:16.710" style="s2">exactly it&#39;s like it&#39;s like I it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.279" end="00:08:19.319" style="s2">I I say explicitly that I&#39;m a Christian</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.710" end="00:08:21.870" style="s2">like it&#39;s part of my upfront identity</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.319" end="00:08:24.360" style="s2">and because of that I know that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.870" end="00:08:25.949" style="s2">a there&#39;s a limit to how many people are</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.360" end="00:08:27.659" style="s2">going to listen to what I&#39;m saying I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.949" end="00:08:29.189" style="s2">accepted that like it&#39;s something that I</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.659" end="00:08:31.919" style="s2">decided to do and I&#39;ve accepted it like</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.189" end="00:08:35.130" style="s2">because he&#39;s he&#39;s a he&#39;s acting as this</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.919" end="00:08:37.589" style="s2">weird kind of in-between figure he he</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.130" end="00:08:40.199" style="s2">doesn&#39;t he&#39;s not threatening to people</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.589" end="00:08:42.659" style="s2">they don&#39;t they don&#39;t feel like he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.199" end="00:08:44.159" style="s2">gonna try to convert them like they they</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.659" end="00:08:46.709" style="s2">feel like the discussion that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.159" end="00:08:48.600" style="s2">having is honest and genuine and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.709" end="00:08:50.850" style="s2">actually trying to work this stuff out</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.600" end="00:08:52.890" style="s2">and the truth is he really is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.850" end="00:08:54.600" style="s2">work this stuff out Jordan hasn&#39;t when</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.890" end="00:08:55.300" style="s2">Jordan says when he doesn&#39;t answer the</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.600" end="00:08:56.650" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.300" end="00:08:58.180" style="s2">like you believe in the resurrection of</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.650" end="00:09:01.390" style="s2">Christ if when he doesn&#39;t answer the</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.180" end="00:09:03.160" style="s2">question do you believe in God it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.390" end="00:09:04.990" style="s2">because he&#39;s really is trying to figure</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.160" end="00:09:07.810" style="s2">it out for himself he&#39;s not he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.990" end="00:09:10.360" style="s2">it&#39;s not a it&#39;s not a theater move that</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.810" end="00:09:13.300" style="s2">he&#39;s doing like he he you know I had up</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.360" end="00:09:15.550" style="s2">I had a discussion with Jordan just a</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.300" end="00:09:17.680" style="s2">few weeks ago where he he called me and</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.550" end="00:09:19.840" style="s2">we started talking about about Genesis</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.680" end="00:09:21.880" style="s2">again and attention and this hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.840" end="00:09:23.590" style="s2">of attention and everything and how how</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.880" end="00:09:25.030" style="s2">God gathering the dust and blowing his</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.590" end="00:09:26.980" style="s2">spirit into the dust is the same</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.030" end="00:09:28.150" style="s2">structure as how we basically encounter</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.980" end="00:09:31.270" style="s2">the world like we gather in this</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.150" end="00:09:32.920" style="s2">potentiality then we infuse meaning into</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.270" end="00:09:35.080" style="s2">it and he was like and then he said</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.920" end="00:09:36.550" style="s2">something he said he said Oh said it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.080" end="00:09:40.930" style="s2">so terrifying to think that these</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.550" end="00:09:42.730" style="s2">stories could actually be true like what</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.930" end="00:09:44.260" style="s2">do you mean what do you mean it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.730" end="00:09:45.850" style="s2">terrifying he said well what do we do</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.260" end="00:09:48.520" style="s2">what do we do if they&#39;re true you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.850" end="00:09:49.930" style="s2">and so it&#39;s like Jordan is actually he</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.520" end="00:09:51.370" style="s2">actually is working through this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.930" end="00:09:53.020" style="s2">he&#39;s not pretending and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.370" end="00:09:55.630" style="s2">one of the reasons why people have been</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.020" end="00:09:57.940" style="s2">so genuinely interested in what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.630" end="00:09:59.080" style="s2">saying he&#39;s no different in private than</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.940" end="00:10:01.240" style="s2">he is in public like this is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.080" end="00:10:02.350" style="s2">happening I think that the Christians</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.240" end="00:10:05.080" style="s2">most of the Christians that I&#39;ve reacted</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.350" end="00:10:07.960" style="s2">negatively to him have been the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.080" end="00:10:10.750" style="s2">Calvinist types that the kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.960" end="00:10:12.280" style="s2">more rigid are you saved</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.750" end="00:10:14.260" style="s2">are you not saved like that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.280" end="00:10:17.050" style="s2">Christian I think they&#39;re the ones who</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.260" end="00:10:19.840" style="s2">have been reacting more to him I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.050" end="00:10:21.280" style="s2">that most other people have just</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.840" end="00:10:22.390" style="s2">accepted that he personally he&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.280" end="00:10:25.540" style="s2">Christian he&#39;s not saying he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.390" end="00:10:28.780" style="s2">Christian and and he&#39;s just there I</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.540" end="00:10:31.300" style="s2">always talk about him as as a kind of uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.780" end="00:10:32.530" style="s2">as a transitional figure he said I</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.300" end="00:10:35.410" style="s2">always say that he&#39;s like King Cyrus</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.530" end="00:10:37.570" style="s2">King Cyrus in the Bible he he&#39;s the one</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.410" end="00:10:39.490" style="s2">who sent the Israelites back to build</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.570" end="00:10:40.660" style="s2">their temple like he wasn&#39;t any is he</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.490" end="00:10:43.210" style="s2">wasn&#39;t in his real light he didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.660" end="00:10:45.820" style="s2">believe in God like he he had all these</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.210" end="00:10:47.980" style="s2">idols and he and he he was he was a man</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.820" end="00:10:50.800" style="s2">of you know a powerful man but because</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.980" end="00:10:52.600" style="s2">he he was a then because of that he was</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.800" end="00:10:54.550" style="s2">the one who was able to say like hey you</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.600" end="00:10:55.840" style="s2">know why don&#39;t you go back in that</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.550" end="00:10:57.010" style="s2">temple that you had you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.840" end="00:10:58.510" style="s2">there&#39;s something interesting there was</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.010" end="00:11:00.100" style="s2">it interesting you you should do that</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.510" end="00:11:03.640" style="s2">you should go back like go back to your</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.100" end="00:11:05.380" style="s2">thing and because of that there have</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.640" end="00:11:07.870" style="s2">been I mean I&#39;ve been witnessing to</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.380" end="00:11:08.819" style="s2">myself like there are thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.870" end="00:11:10.410" style="s2">people that are going</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.819" end="00:11:12.119" style="s2">to church like at least at least</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.410" end="00:11:14.399" style="s2">hundreds of people have written me</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.119" end="00:11:16.350" style="s2">personally emails talking about how</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.399" end="00:11:18.029" style="s2">they&#39;re kind of rediscovering their</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.350" end="00:11:21.899" style="s2">Christian faith at a different level</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.029" end="00:11:23.970" style="s2">they kind of move past the the 13 year</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.899" end="00:11:25.559" style="s2">old version of Christianity and they</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.970" end="00:11:27.179" style="s2">discovered something more more powerful</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.559" end="00:11:29.129" style="s2">and I keep telling them like that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.179" end="00:11:31.559" style="s2">Christianity is it&#39;s all that&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.129" end="00:11:33.179" style="s2">what it&#39;s been maybe not obviously not</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.559" end="00:11:34.619" style="s2">the evolutionary biology so because they</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.179" end="00:11:36.509" style="s2">didn&#39;t talk about that stuff but the</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.619" end="00:11:39.239" style="s2">notion that these that these stories</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.509" end="00:11:41.489" style="s2">manifest these ways of being and these</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.239" end="00:11:43.079" style="s2">these manners of encountering the world</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.489" end="00:11:46.439" style="s2">and that it has to do with consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.079" end="00:11:48.269" style="s2">and has to do with our or our experience</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.439" end="00:11:50.129" style="s2">of the world like that there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.269" end="00:11:52.439" style="s2">mystery like that&#39;s really what what</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.129" end="00:11:55.709" style="s2">it&#39;s about you know so you can you can</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.439" end="00:11:57.239" style="s2">easily go back to church and then and</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.709" end="00:11:58.619" style="s2">then discover that now it doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.239" end="00:12:00.959" style="s2">that when you go back to church you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.619" end="00:12:04.229" style="s2">only going to encounter people who who</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.959" end="00:12:05.549" style="s2">understand that religion is a hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.229" end="00:12:07.319" style="s2">like the way it&#39;s set up is the</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.549" end="00:12:09.329" style="s2">hierarchy it&#39;s it&#39;s there the way the</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.319" end="00:12:12.569" style="s2">stories are told there they&#39;re supposed</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.329" end="00:12:15.479" style="s2">to be able to engage and touch the</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.569" end="00:12:17.879" style="s2">dumbest peasant right and at the same</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.479" end="00:12:21.029" style="s2">time engage and touch the scholar the</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.879" end="00:12:23.519" style="s2">the scholar of religion the philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.029" end="00:12:26.399" style="s2">okay but you can&#39;t expect everybody to</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.519" end="00:12:28.169" style="s2">have the same level of understanding so</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.399" end="00:12:30.299" style="s2">if you go to a church you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.169" end="00:12:33.959" style="s2">encounter someone who has a very direct</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.299" end="00:12:36.449" style="s2">very literal very kind of in-your-face</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.959" end="00:12:38.339" style="s2">vision of what those stories are about</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.449" end="00:12:38.669" style="s2">and you shouldn&#39;t be surprised about</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.339" end="00:12:42.449" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.669" end="00:12:44.369" style="s2">because that&#39;s for everybody to fit it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.449" end="00:12:45.989" style="s2">like the saying the sam harris version</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.369" end="00:12:48.089" style="s2">of religion he would be able to</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.989" end="00:12:49.439" style="s2">enlighten everybody so that everybody</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.089" end="00:12:51.809" style="s2">understood the higher meaning of</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.439" end="00:12:53.759" style="s2">religion and nobody was attached to</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.809" end="00:12:57.299" style="s2">their like the kind of more immediate</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.759" end="00:12:59.189" style="s2">lower version of of a believing stuff</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.299" end="00:13:02.129" style="s2">and it&#39;s like that&#39;s not gonna happen</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.189" end="00:13:03.329" style="s2">some people are never going to reach</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.129" end="00:13:06.269" style="s2">that some people are never going to</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.329" end="00:13:07.649" style="s2">reach that level it&#39;s impossible you the</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.269" end="00:13:10.129" style="s2">reason we&#39;re talking is you go in touch</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.649" end="00:13:12.809" style="s2">with me to talk about organized religion</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.129" end="00:13:14.249" style="s2">which is a subject I&#39;m really interested</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.809" end="00:13:17.189" style="s2">to hear your thoughts it&#39;s a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.249" end="00:13:19.319" style="s2">common the kind of common story for the</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.189" end="00:13:22.029" style="s2">last few generations in the West I grew</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.319" end="00:13:27.040" style="s2">up in a Protestant kind of Baptist</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.029" end="00:13:28.600" style="s2">background very very conservative I</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.040" end="00:13:30.700" style="s2">would say like a you know conservative</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.600" end="00:13:31.800" style="s2">thinking a lot of creationism all that</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.700" end="00:13:34.540" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.800" end="00:13:36.579" style="s2">luckily my father was a very intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.540" end="00:13:38.440" style="s2">person he was a pastor actually for a</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.579" end="00:13:39.970" style="s2">part of my youth and he was very he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.440" end="00:13:41.800" style="s2">very curious and very intelligent person</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.970" end="00:13:44.709" style="s2">you always encourage inquiry and</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.800" end="00:13:46.240" style="s2">encourage deeper thinking so the the</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.709" end="00:13:47.560" style="s2">whatever fundamentalism I was getting</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.240" end="00:13:49.420" style="s2">was mostly getting it from my</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.560" end="00:13:51.640" style="s2">surrounding not not necessarily for my</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.420" end="00:13:53.140" style="s2">family but I kind of had to say in</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.640" end="00:13:55.899" style="s2">university I started asking a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.140" end="00:13:59.709" style="s2">questions and I started seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.899" end="00:14:02.980" style="s2">limits let&#39;s say of where I was coming</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.709" end="00:14:04.570" style="s2">from and I started to discover the same</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.980" end="00:14:07.870" style="s2">as you I started to read texts from</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.570" end="00:14:10.750" style="s2">Eastern traditions from read more you</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.870" end="00:14:12.610" style="s2">know kind of Gnostic type text and I</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.750" end="00:14:13.750" style="s2">thought okay what I could understand</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.610" end="00:14:15.060" style="s2">what they&#39;re talking about like what</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.750" end="00:14:16.980" style="s2">they&#39;re talking about this this</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.060" end="00:14:19.300" style="s2">transformation of the person that</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.980" end="00:14:21.519" style="s2">salvation the way was presented to me as</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.300" end="00:14:23.740" style="s2">a as a child that&#39;s there as a young</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.519" end="00:14:25.930" style="s2">person was you believe in Jesus right</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.740" end="00:14:27.699" style="s2">you leave in Jesus and then you&#39;re saved</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.930" end="00:14:29.170" style="s2">so it was like believe in Jesus and you</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.699" end="00:14:31.540" style="s2">get this ticket you know you die you go</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.170" end="00:14:33.640" style="s2">to heaven like yeah I then I read the</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.540" end="00:14:35.290" style="s2">Mystics and I realize okay that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.640" end="00:14:37.720" style="s2">what it&#39;s about but that&#39;s not exactly</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.290" end="00:14:39.459" style="s2">what it&#39;s talking about it is talking</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.720" end="00:14:41.560" style="s2">about this transformation of the person</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.459" end="00:14:43.570" style="s2">and the notion of ascending into heaven</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.560" end="00:14:46.810" style="s2">it is it&#39;s a transformation of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.570" end="00:14:49.089" style="s2">person to become to be free from the</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.810" end="00:14:51.550" style="s2">let&#39;s say the things that hold us down</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.089" end="00:14:53.350" style="s2">like our passions and and you know our</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.550" end="00:14:55.810" style="s2">belly and all those things that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.350" end="00:14:59.019" style="s2">hold us back and our thoughts all of</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.810" end="00:15:01.149" style="s2">that needs to kind of to fall away and</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.019" end="00:15:03.699" style="s2">then to enter into that silence let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.149" end="00:15:06.250" style="s2">say that the inner silence and the this</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.699" end="00:15:07.839" style="s2">uh this transcendent place that we can</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.250" end="00:15:09.519" style="s2">find in our heart and that God can</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.839" end="00:15:11.290" style="s2">interact with us so I was like okay</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.519" end="00:15:13.660" style="s2">that&#39;s awesome and but at first I</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.290" end="00:15:15.610" style="s2">thought at first I thought okay well why</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.660" end="00:15:18.670" style="s2">is it that it doesn&#39;t why is it that I</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.610" end="00:15:20.589" style="s2">find this in reading you know Hindu</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.670" end="00:15:23.610" style="s2">texts or reading Gnostic texts or</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.589" end="00:15:26.199" style="s2">reading kind of weird weird text but</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.610" end="00:15:28.750" style="s2">it&#39;s not in Christianity why you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.199" end="00:15:30.190" style="s2">why is that the case and then I realized</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.750" end="00:15:31.660" style="s2">that it was in Christianity it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.190" end="00:15:34.300" style="s2">that no one had ever taught me those</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.660" end="00:15:35.010" style="s2">those traditions and then I discovered</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.300" end="00:15:38.490" style="s2">the church father</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.010" end="00:15:40.350" style="s2">and I discovered the the mystical</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.490" end="00:15:42.660" style="s2">Christian tradition hesychasm</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.350" end="00:15:44.760" style="s2">especially the the tradition of the east</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.660" end="00:15:47.310" style="s2">that&#39;s when I discovered st. gregory of</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.760" end="00:15:49.350" style="s2">nyssa and some maximus the confessor and</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.310" end="00:15:53.250" style="s2">gregory palamas this whole line of</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.350" end="00:15:55.020" style="s2">mystical teachers that that are in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.250" end="00:15:57.560" style="s2">Orthodox tradition and that led me</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.020" end="00:16:00.930" style="s2">finally to convert to orthodoxy where</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.560" end="00:16:02.640" style="s2">everything is seen through that mystical</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.930" end="00:16:05.340" style="s2">lens and so the whole purpose of</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.640" end="00:16:07.650" style="s2">everything we do even all the rules that</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.340" end="00:16:08.790" style="s2">we have they&#39;re not just simple moral</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.650" end="00:16:10.080" style="s2">rules of you should do this you</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.790" end="00:16:12.630" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t do that but they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.080" end="00:16:15.750" style="s2">just basically tools to help you move</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.630" end="00:16:18.840" style="s2">into your heart and encounter Christ and</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.750" end="00:16:22.380" style="s2">be illuminated by Christ and so that was</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.840" end="00:16:25.770" style="s2">kind of my my past and in that I</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.380" end="00:16:28.170" style="s2">discovered the symbolic language and and</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.770" end="00:16:30.420" style="s2">how the symbolic language had to do with</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.170" end="00:16:32.010" style="s2">this notion of I talked about kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.420" end="00:16:34.110" style="s2">entering the heart in terms of a person</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.010" end="00:16:35.310" style="s2">but you can do that in terms of of your</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.110" end="00:16:38.190" style="s2">experience of the world so the world</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.310" end="00:16:39.990" style="s2">actually comes together and starts to</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.190" end="00:16:43.530" style="s2">shine like things start to be brighter</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.990" end="00:16:47.040" style="s2">than they were before as you see things</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.530" end="00:16:48.660" style="s2">come together in in in the logo so you</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.040" end="00:16:49.830" style="s2">could say like I think people who are</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.660" end="00:16:51.720" style="s2">listening to you will now start to know</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.830" end="00:16:54.120" style="s2">with that that means it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.720" end="00:16:57.270" style="s2">gobbledygook right and so that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.120" end="00:17:02.670" style="s2">kind of what led me to to where I am and</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.270" end="00:17:05.250" style="s2">so for me the discovery for me in terms</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.670" end="00:17:06.839" style="s2">of organized religion I think that in</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.250" end="00:17:09.630" style="s2">order for all the levels to be stacked</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.839" end="00:17:11.670" style="s2">up properly you know because you one of</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.630" end="00:17:13.320" style="s2">the things that is still accessible to</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.670" end="00:17:15.900" style="s2">most people today is this idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.320" end="00:17:17.459" style="s2">personal mystical experience right but</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.900" end="00:17:19.770" style="s2">the difficulty with that personal</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.459" end="00:17:24.690" style="s2">mystical experience is that if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.770" end="00:17:27.390" style="s2">proper right it also has to to stack at</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.690" end="00:17:29.480" style="s2">the the next level and it also has to</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.390" end="00:17:31.860" style="s2">bring communities together</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.480" end="00:17:34.140" style="s2">ready can&#39;t just be on an individual</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.860" end="00:17:36.180" style="s2">level because it it has to line up with</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.140" end="00:17:40.400" style="s2">the way the world exists and so if you</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.180" end="00:17:42.390" style="s2">if you if you start to have let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.400" end="00:17:45.030" style="s2">intuitions mystical intuitions or you</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.390" end="00:17:46.650" style="s2">start to have that process of getting</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.030" end="00:17:47.030" style="s2">rid of these passions that you have and</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.650" end="00:17:49.790" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.030" end="00:17:53.120" style="s2">moving in then that also needs to happen</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.790" end="00:17:54.890" style="s2">at the communal level and then it has to</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.120" end="00:17:57.920" style="s2">have it it has to have a social</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.890" end="00:18:00.140" style="s2">equivalent or else it&#39;s not real it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.920" end="00:18:05.380" style="s2">not totally real so I think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.140" end="00:18:07.670" style="s2">why for me in the end there had to be a</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.380" end="00:18:09.950" style="s2">religious aspect to it religious and</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.670" end="00:18:12.770" style="s2">really in the sense of a place where you</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.950" end="00:18:14.720" style="s2">go and you are in communion with other</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.770" end="00:18:16.370" style="s2">people the same way that you&#39;re able to</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.720" end="00:18:18.320" style="s2">commune your thoughts together in your</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.370" end="00:18:20.480" style="s2">heart you have to rep that has to happen</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.320" end="00:18:21.710" style="s2">again at a social level and ideally it</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.480" end="00:18:24.020" style="s2">has to happen at a kind of universal</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.710" end="00:18:26.210" style="s2">level where those churches also are</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.020" end="00:18:28.460" style="s2">communion with other churches and that</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.210" end="00:18:29.900" style="s2">kind of creates this body which is in</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.460" end="00:18:32.120" style="s2">Christianity called the body of Christ</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.900" end="00:18:33.590" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of this this cosmic body you</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.120" end="00:18:37.400" style="s2">could say where everything kind of comes</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.590" end="00:18:39.650" style="s2">together and so it&#39;s like I think that</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.400" end="00:18:42.020" style="s2">we can do that we can kind of engage in</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.650" end="00:18:45.020" style="s2">in Christianity in the body of Christ</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.020" end="00:18:46.730" style="s2">without being naive right without being</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.020" end="00:18:49.040" style="s2">naive in not understanding that just</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.730" end="00:18:50.840" style="s2">like in myself I have all these things</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.040" end="00:18:52.340" style="s2">pulling me in all these directions that</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.840" end="00:18:54.320" style="s2">I have all these crazy thoughts that I</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.340" end="00:18:56.000" style="s2">have all these crazy desires that I have</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.320" end="00:18:57.830" style="s2">different personalities sometimes it</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.000" end="00:19:00.080" style="s2">manifests themselves and I start to act</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.830" end="00:19:02.560" style="s2">in these weird patterns so - on a social</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.080" end="00:19:04.670" style="s2">level you have the same problem you have</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.560" end="00:19:06.410" style="s2">perversions that set themselves up you</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.670" end="00:19:09.050" style="s2">have power struggles etcetera something</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.410" end="00:19:13.850" style="s2">all this stuff happens at at the church</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.050" end="00:19:15.830" style="s2">level and so I think it&#39;s it&#39;s incumbent</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.850" end="00:19:17.600" style="s2">on us not to be naive about it not also</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.830" end="00:19:18.980" style="s2">to just accept it but also not to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.600" end="00:19:21.170" style="s2">scandalized by the fact that that</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.980" end="00:19:23.390" style="s2">happened because if it happens in me</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.170" end="00:19:25.220" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna happen at the other level -</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.390" end="00:19:27.380" style="s2">like I&#39;m not I&#39;m not you know I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.220" end="00:19:31.850" style="s2">fully illuminated let&#39;s say I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.380" end="00:19:33.710" style="s2">if that makes sense yeah I I feel the</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.850" end="00:19:36.500" style="s2">first bit you were saying about sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.710" end="00:19:39.320" style="s2">the transformational aspect of of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.500" end="00:19:42.740" style="s2">experience is something I resonate with</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.320" end="00:19:45.920" style="s2">because I&#39;ve done a lot of personal</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.740" end="00:19:48.290" style="s2">growth work which I now feel like I</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.920" end="00:19:49.850" style="s2">understand at a deeper level because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.290" end="00:19:52.070" style="s2">now framing it within okay the more I</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.850" end="00:19:54.440" style="s2">speak my I speak my truth the more align</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.070" end="00:19:56.510" style="s2">myself with the logos the more the more</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.440" end="00:19:58.670" style="s2">I simplify my being in some way the more</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.510" end="00:20:00.260" style="s2">I kind of have this and able to live</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.670" end="00:20:01.640" style="s2">that out in my own life and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.260" end="00:20:03.860" style="s2">able to frame a lot of the work that</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.640" end="00:20:06.670" style="s2">I&#39;ve done which was probably offered</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.860" end="00:20:09.830" style="s2">more within a new agey kind of framework</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.670" end="00:20:13.970" style="s2">within a slightly deeper cut much deeper</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.830" end="00:20:15.140" style="s2">Christian framework yeah but I also Paul</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.970" end="00:20:17.480" style="s2">Van de clay said that you were quite</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.140" end="00:20:19.190" style="s2">skeptical about Jung because because I</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.480" end="00:20:24.620" style="s2">would say Jung maps on to that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.190" end="00:20:28.220" style="s2">transformational aspect of of growth and</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.620" end="00:20:29.810" style="s2">and religious experience I think you</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.220" end="00:20:31.700" style="s2">know it&#39;s weird I keep telling you I</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.810" end="00:20:33.740" style="s2">haven&#39;t really read Jung that much like</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.700" end="00:20:34.970" style="s2">I&#39;ve read a little bit of Jung that</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.740" end="00:20:36.770" style="s2">everybody&#39;s read when they&#39;re in college</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.970" end="00:20:41.480" style="s2">or whatever like I haven&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.770" end="00:20:43.370" style="s2">studied Jung very much I think that the</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.480" end="00:20:46.130" style="s2">reason why I hadn&#39;t I had never studied</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.370" end="00:20:47.660" style="s2">Jung is that I feel like he he he makes</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.130" end="00:20:48.860" style="s2">what he Key&#39;s kind of like Jordan it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.660" end="00:20:50.980" style="s2">worried because I it&#39;s like it&#39;s like I</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.860" end="00:20:53.600" style="s2">like Jordan because I know him and we</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.980" end="00:20:55.760" style="s2">like he comes up to the psychological</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.600" end="00:20:57.290" style="s2">level and then he kind of stopped there</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.760" end="00:21:01.670" style="s2">but maybe I&#39;m wrong that&#39;s the feeling</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.290" end="00:21:04.430" style="s2">that I get is that I feel like the step</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.670" end="00:21:07.580" style="s2">after Jung is to realize that that is</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.430" end="00:21:12.080" style="s2">really how reality is in an objective</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.580" end="00:21:13.340" style="s2">way that is like you know you see for</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.080" end="00:21:14.450" style="s2">example Jordan does this thing like he</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.340" end="00:21:15.710" style="s2">did this thing this I&#39;m here debates</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.450" end="00:21:17.690" style="s2">where he talks about the spirit of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.710" end="00:21:19.490" style="s2">father coming up like this notion of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.690" end="00:21:21.680" style="s2">Spirit of the father being kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.490" end="00:21:23.870" style="s2">elected by the people who elect to hide</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.680" end="00:21:25.310" style="s2">the sense of the leader and then that</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.870" end="00:21:27.140" style="s2">keeps going and going going and that</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.310" end="00:21:29.540" style="s2">comes up and then we have this image of</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.140" end="00:21:31.070" style="s2">the Father and heaven right and then</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.540" end="00:21:32.510" style="s2">it&#39;s like that&#39;s it that&#39;s yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.070" end="00:21:34.460" style="s2">right that&#39;s right that&#39;s right but then</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.510" end="00:21:36.410" style="s2">at some point you have to realize it</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.460" end="00:21:38.360" style="s2">that&#39;s the reason why that happened</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.410" end="00:21:41.480" style="s2">because that&#39;s actually the shape of</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.360" end="00:21:43.790" style="s2">reality like you were not we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.480" end="00:21:45.530" style="s2">separate from reality okay we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.790" end="00:21:49.760" style="s2">separate from that process like that</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.530" end="00:21:52.070" style="s2">process it in order to for it to to have</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.760" end="00:21:53.630" style="s2">happened in - to persist like it has to</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.070" end="00:21:55.550" style="s2">manifest something about the real world</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.630" end="00:21:59.000" style="s2">like it has to manifest something about</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.550" end="00:22:01.880" style="s2">about how reality is structure and so</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.000" end="00:22:03.500" style="s2">then for me it&#39;s like then you can to me</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.880" end="00:22:07.340" style="s2">it&#39;s not a then it becomes not a problem</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.500" end="00:22:10.760" style="s2">to say I can say my father our Father</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.340" end="00:22:12.920" style="s2">who is in heaven and I and I can just</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.760" end="00:22:14.119" style="s2">say that I don&#39;t have to do all the</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.920" end="00:22:15.799" style="s2">psychological work behind</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.119" end="00:22:17.719" style="s2">like I don&#39;t have to kind of convince</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.799" end="00:22:19.159" style="s2">myself about all these steps about how</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.719" end="00:22:20.809" style="s2">the spirit of the father merged out of</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.159" end="00:22:22.249" style="s2">all these different that it&#39;s like I can</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.809" end="00:22:24.289" style="s2">just say our Father was in heaven and I</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.249" end="00:22:27.229" style="s2">know that that&#39;s the truest way to</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.289" end="00:22:29.799" style="s2">encounter the the infinite power let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.229" end="00:22:32.869" style="s2">say the the the infinity of of</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.799" end="00:22:35.269" style="s2">generation of the of the infinite</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.869" end="00:22:37.069" style="s2">generating person and I can I can say</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.269" end="00:22:40.309" style="s2">that so to me it&#39;s I always felt like</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.069" end="00:22:41.749" style="s2">young kind of stopped there and I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.309" end="00:22:43.789" style="s2">that one of the problems I had with</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.749" end="00:22:46.039" style="s2">young too is I think I felt like he was</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.789" end="00:22:48.469" style="s2">it&#39;s not his fault totally he was in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.039" end="00:22:51.079" style="s2">19th century early 20th century occult</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.469" end="00:22:52.909" style="s2">like the kind of occult thinking where</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.079" end="00:22:54.829" style="s2">it was really it was that strong sense</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.909" end="00:22:56.209" style="s2">of Christians got it wrong Christians</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.829" end="00:22:58.999" style="s2">didn&#39;t understand what they were doing</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.209" end="00:23:00.949" style="s2">it&#39;s like here I&#39;m gonna show you like</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.999" end="00:23:02.869" style="s2">what it really was and also that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.949" end="00:23:05.269" style="s2">kind of get hung up on Gnosticism it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.869" end="00:23:06.949" style="s2">like you&#39;ll know so did that she was</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.269" end="00:23:08.959" style="s2">like oh the Gnostics got it right the</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.949" end="00:23:11.659" style="s2">Christians got it wrong and then here we</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.959" end="00:23:14.329" style="s2">are you know poor us we where like if</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.659" end="00:23:15.559" style="s2">the Gnostics had had one like we&#39;d be so</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.329" end="00:23:16.879" style="s2">more in light so much more enlightened</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.559" end="00:23:18.709" style="s2">think that that I think that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.879" end="00:23:20.569" style="s2">that&#39;s the wrong way to go about it and</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.709" end="00:23:23.029" style="s2">I think that it&#39;s subversive in the end</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.569" end="00:23:25.459" style="s2">that it actually ends up I think that</p>

<p begin="00:23:44.749" end="00:23:49.039" style="s2">fragment like it&#39;s revealing us the real</p>

<p begin="00:23:58.369" end="00:24:03.019" style="s2">think that that&#39;s a that&#39;s a subversive</p>

<p begin="00:24:10.609" end="00:24:14.359" style="s2">to be fair like I haven&#39;t read</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.229" end="00:24:16.669" style="s2">I haven&#39;t read enough young to to be and</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.359" end="00:24:18.379" style="s2">that&#39;s why I haven&#39;t actually never I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.669" end="00:24:19.789" style="s2">never been openly critical about you</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.379" end="00:24:21.379" style="s2">neither I&#39;ve always kind of distanced</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.789" end="00:24:22.699" style="s2">myself from him but I&#39;d never been</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.379" end="00:24:24.829" style="s2">openly critical about him because I</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.699" end="00:24:27.289" style="s2">don&#39;t know enough about him to to really</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.829" end="00:24:27.950" style="s2">be able to say even I probably what I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.289" end="00:24:30.019" style="s2">already said</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.950" end="00:24:33.039" style="s2">might be wrong because I know what I</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.019" end="00:24:37.220" style="s2">know for secondary sources and stuff I</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.039" end="00:24:39.110" style="s2">guess you&#39;re you&#39;re saying it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.220" end="00:24:40.279" style="s2">all was like explaining Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.110" end="00:24:44.440" style="s2">away and rather than explaining</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.279" end="00:24:44.440" style="s2">Christianity that is that your sense I</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.529" end="00:24:50.120" style="s2">know I would i I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.360" end="00:24:51.440" style="s2">explaining it away it&#39;s like I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.120" end="00:24:53.600" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.440" end="00:24:55.250" style="s2">you know a it&#39;s a kind of it&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.600" end="00:24:56.990" style="s2">sign it I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.250" end="00:24:59.179" style="s2">sign to somebody it&#39;s a kind of it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.990" end="00:25:01.909" style="s2">kind of manner to say that reductionism</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.179" end="00:25:03.919" style="s2">if we can find the psychological</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.909" end="00:25:07.970" style="s2">mechanisms by which these things happen</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.919" end="00:25:10.309" style="s2">then we don&#39;t need the the metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.970" end="00:25:14.470" style="s2">let&#39;s say instead of seeing that the</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.309" end="00:25:17.510" style="s2">psychological structure is manifesting</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.470" end="00:25:19.039" style="s2">the structure of reality right it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.510" end="00:25:20.929" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s mirroring the structure of</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.039" end="00:25:22.519" style="s2">reality so reductionism would be a</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.929" end="00:25:24.110" style="s2">better maybe that&#39;s a way to see it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.519" end="00:25:25.970" style="s2">maybe that would be a way to say it</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.110" end="00:25:29.450" style="s2">which is sort of what the materialist</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.970" end="00:25:31.669" style="s2">day by saying well it&#39;s just it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.450" end="00:25:34.580" style="s2">chemicals what it&#39;s just by it&#39;s just it</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.669" end="00:25:36.799" style="s2">so that&#39;s what there&#39;s no need for the</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.580" end="00:25:38.630" style="s2">word just in that like yes it is</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.799" end="00:25:40.820" style="s2">chemicals but how is that not</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.630" end="00:25:42.620" style="s2">necessarily representing another reality</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.820" end="00:25:44.480" style="s2">or another reality and that all of these</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.620" end="00:25:46.070" style="s2">realities are stacked its other gamma</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.480" end="00:25:48.889" style="s2">it&#39;s a judgment of what you&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.070" end="00:25:51.200" style="s2">your primary lens and then assuming</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.889" end="00:25:52.669" style="s2">everything else is is should be seen</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.200" end="00:25:55.639" style="s2">through that lens rather than saying</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.669" end="00:25:56.960" style="s2">well there are multiple levels and there</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.639" end="00:25:58.490" style="s2">and things are manifesting at all of</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.960" end="00:26:00.440" style="s2">them yeah because we don&#39;t we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.490" end="00:26:03.440" style="s2">experience love as a bunch of chemicals</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.440" end="00:26:06.350" style="s2">in our brain if you do yeah like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.440" end="00:26:08.720" style="s2">you in trouble we experience love in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.350" end="00:26:11.450" style="s2">realm of language and consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.720" end="00:26:13.010" style="s2">relationship and and and and if you try</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.450" end="00:26:16.130" style="s2">to reduce that to the chemicals in your</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.010" end="00:26:19.510" style="s2">brain you&#39;re not doing justice to the</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.130" end="00:26:21.919" style="s2">experience of that you&#39;re you&#39;re and and</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.510" end="00:26:23.149" style="s2">you know I I think that that if it</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.919" end="00:26:25.460" style="s2">brings us back to the discussion about</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.149" end="00:26:28.940" style="s2">Sam Harris a we had that we had before</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.460" end="00:26:30.559" style="s2">where there&#39;s a there&#39;s a podcast where</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.940" end="00:26:32.750" style="s2">he talked with it I forget who it was</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.559" end="00:26:35.330" style="s2">yet a podcast about this notion of house</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.750" end="00:26:37.250" style="s2">reality stacks like how you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.330" end="00:26:40.429" style="s2">emergent they call emergent phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.250" end="00:26:41.790" style="s2">right how how things come together into</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.429" end="00:26:43.710" style="s2">identities right at higher</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.790" end="00:26:45.270" style="s2">because it&#39;s not just a quantum field</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.710" end="00:26:46.980" style="s2">like we don&#39;t just experience it but in</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.270" end="00:26:48.900" style="s2">the end it is just a quantum field right</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.980" end="00:26:50.940" style="s2">it is just in terms of material</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.900" end="00:26:52.410" style="s2">substrate it&#39;s just a quantum field and</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.940" end="00:26:54.870" style="s2">so but then how do these different</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.410" end="00:26:57.390" style="s2">levels of reality stack on each other</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.870" end="00:26:58.890" style="s2">and Sam kept wanting to he&#39;s kept saying</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.390" end="00:27:01.920" style="s2">I want to explain it with the lowest</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.890" end="00:27:04.680" style="s2">common possible thing but that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.920" end="00:27:06.240" style="s2">make sense because you know like</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.680" end="00:27:09.270" style="s2">millions and billions like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.240" end="00:27:11.340" style="s2">millions of atoms in your hand and</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.270" end="00:27:13.170" style="s2">there&#39;s no point in explaining it with</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.340" end="00:27:14.730" style="s2">those millions of atoms instead of</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.170" end="00:27:16.920" style="s2">explaining it with the deer like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.730" end="00:27:18.660" style="s2">thirsty I&#39;m going to drink a glass of</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.920" end="00:27:20.870" style="s2">water explaining it through the realm of</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.660" end="00:27:23.370" style="s2">consciousness and I think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.870" end="00:27:25.080" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.370" end="00:27:26.910" style="s2">that just because you find the material</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.080" end="00:27:30.450" style="s2">causes of something does it mean that</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.910" end="00:27:33.180" style="s2">you&#39;ve eliminated the higher realities I</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.450" end="00:27:34.770" style="s2">think I think it&#39;s to me it&#39;s so obvious</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.180" end="00:27:36.780" style="s2">but I guess a lot of people aren&#39;t able</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.770" end="00:27:39.000" style="s2">to see it but it to me it&#39;s so obvious</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.780" end="00:27:42.590" style="s2">like I can both say that the music that</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.000" end="00:27:45.660" style="s2">I like comes from my my iPod you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.590" end="00:27:47.640" style="s2">but also comes from I don&#39;t know like</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.660" end="00:27:48.990" style="s2">Kanye West or whatever like it and and I</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.640" end="00:27:52.770" style="s2">can also say that Kanye West is</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.990" end="00:27:56.640" style="s2">manifesting you know certain immutable</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.770" end="00:27:59.040" style="s2">patterns of relationships that make it</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.640" end="00:28:00.870" style="s2">so that I can like that music and so</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.040" end="00:28:02.340" style="s2">it&#39;s like I don&#39;t have to eliminate I</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.870" end="00:28:04.500" style="s2">don&#39;t have to say well I know I</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.340" end="00:28:07.260" style="s2">discovered the secret of music it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.500" end="00:28:07.800" style="s2">coming from my earphones I&#39;ve got I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.260" end="00:28:09.660" style="s2">got it</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.800" end="00:28:12.150" style="s2">you dumb people who think the music</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.660" end="00:28:13.770" style="s2">particles exactly it&#39;s like so you dumb</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.150" end="00:28:15.930" style="s2">people who think that music has meaning</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.770" end="00:28:18.870" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s all moving particles yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.930" end="00:28:20.520" style="s2">I could just imagine a music review page</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.870" end="00:28:22.050" style="s2">that was just like every single every</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.520" end="00:28:27.480" style="s2">single album was it&#39;s just moving</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.050" end="00:28:29.880" style="s2">particles different way to the other</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.480" end="00:28:31.950" style="s2">ones exactly and it&#39;s and certain</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.880" end="00:28:33.420" style="s2">chemicals in your brain have been we</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.950" end="00:28:40.710" style="s2">were able to see which section in your</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.420" end="00:28:42.960" style="s2">brain doesn&#39;t is is is active yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.710" end="00:28:45.090" style="s2">problem is that that&#39;s what you find I</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.960" end="00:28:46.140" style="s2">mean that&#39;s what you find in at least a</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.090" end="00:28:49.200" style="s2">lot of the people that I&#39;ve encountered</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.140" end="00:28:51.360" style="s2">that are so against religion you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.200" end="00:28:53.250" style="s2">they say things like God doesn&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.360" end="00:28:55.080" style="s2">and and I think well you know what if</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.250" end="00:28:57.210" style="s2">you think that exists</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.080" end="00:28:58.739" style="s2">means that you can hold it in your hand</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.210" end="00:29:00.090" style="s2">you can touch it and feel it then yes</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.739" end="00:29:02.700" style="s2">God doesn&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.090" end="00:29:04.499" style="s2">fine I&#39;m totally fine with that like if</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.700" end="00:29:06.299" style="s2">you think that if you even if you think</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.499" end="00:29:09.179" style="s2">that it means that you can contain it</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.299" end="00:29:12.360" style="s2">even conceptually then yeah God doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.179" end="00:29:13.919" style="s2">exist right because God the whole idea</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.360" end="00:29:16.289" style="s2">of God in the in the Christian tradition</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.919" end="00:29:19.350" style="s2">and in all the monotheistic traditions</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.289" end="00:29:21.559" style="s2">is that God is uncontainable that God is</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.350" end="00:29:23.730" style="s2">beyond all concept all name all</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.559" end="00:29:25.619" style="s2">representation and that not that the</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.730" end="00:29:27.779" style="s2">representations are arbitrary that they</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.619" end="00:29:29.549" style="s2">help you to kind of get closer to to the</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.779" end="00:29:32.730" style="s2">to the mystery but that but that that</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.549" end="00:29:34.289" style="s2">God is not a thing right and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.730" end="00:29:36.119" style="s2">really hard to argue with an atheist who</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.289" end="00:29:38.009" style="s2">wants you to prove that God exists like</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.119" end="00:29:40.350" style="s2">he wants you like he wants you to prove</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.009" end="00:29:42.809" style="s2">that you know that that that tree has</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.350" end="00:29:44.659" style="s2">fallen in the forest like you can&#39;t it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.809" end="00:29:47.340" style="s2">not the same kind of proof</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.659" end="00:29:50.009" style="s2">even existentialism starts from that</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.340" end="00:29:52.289" style="s2">perspective of realizing the language we</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.009" end="00:29:54.350" style="s2">are using cannot encapsulate the thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.289" end="00:29:57.090" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to explain yeah this is</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.350" end="00:29:58.399" style="s2">everything by definition language is</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.090" end="00:30:00.749" style="s2">going to be a subset of it any</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.399" end="00:30:02.789" style="s2">representation of everything is going to</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.749" end="00:30:06.509" style="s2">be a subset of everything yeah therefore</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.789" end="00:30:08.429" style="s2">it cannot it cannot be articulated yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.509" end="00:30:10.590" style="s2">but I think that the proper way to see</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.429" end="00:30:13.350" style="s2">it at least at least like in it from the</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.590" end="00:30:15.749" style="s2">Orthodox perspective we have this idea</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.350" end="00:30:18.149" style="s2">we have these two visions of theology</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.749" end="00:30:20.309" style="s2">when it&#39;s called apophatic theology and</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.149" end="00:30:22.830" style="s2">catyph Attic theology an apathetic</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.309" end="00:30:25.830" style="s2">theology means this denial right this</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.830" end="00:30:27.600" style="s2">saying that that that God is beyond all</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.830" end="00:30:30.529" style="s2">name all definition right that you</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.600" end="00:30:33.149" style="s2">cannot encompass the divine in in</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.529" end="00:30:36.059" style="s2">language and images and whatever but</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.149" end="00:30:38.879" style="s2">then the other aspect is that because of</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.059" end="00:30:42.570" style="s2">that everything actually does manifest</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.879" end="00:30:43.889" style="s2">the divine right so one of the problems</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.570" end="00:30:45.269" style="s2">people have one of the problems we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.889" end="00:30:47.309" style="s2">seen in post-modernism especially is</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.269" end="00:30:49.409" style="s2">that they&#39;ll have this apathetic move</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.309" end="00:30:51.840" style="s2">well they&#39;ll say something like you</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.409" end="00:30:54.029" style="s2">can&#39;t represent reality reality is</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.840" end="00:30:55.919" style="s2">beyond our capacity to represent it and</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.029" end="00:30:57.889" style="s2">then they make this weird move where</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.919" end="00:31:00.570" style="s2">they say therefore it&#39;s all arbitrary</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.889" end="00:31:02.220" style="s2">right all their structures are arbitrary</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.570" end="00:31:03.960" style="s2">our social structures are constructed</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.220" end="00:31:05.609" style="s2">they&#39;re all arbitrary but that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.960" end="00:31:08.940" style="s2">red move the red move is then to see</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.609" end="00:31:11.580" style="s2">that actually all of reality then flow</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.940" end="00:31:14.520" style="s2">out of that mystery and actually points</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.580" end="00:31:17.040" style="s2">in a very fragmented way but points</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.520" end="00:31:18.600" style="s2">towards that unsaid mystery and so</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.040" end="00:31:19.890" style="s2">that&#39;s what lays out the hierarchy right</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.600" end="00:31:22.200" style="s2">that&#39;s what lays out the hierarchy of</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.890" end="00:31:25.200" style="s2">being is is both those moves where you</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.200" end="00:31:27.510" style="s2">say it&#39;s something beyond but then</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.200" end="00:31:29.160" style="s2">everything is manifesting that beyond</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.510" end="00:31:31.590" style="s2">and it&#39;s kind of its kind of flowing out</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.160" end="00:31:33.930" style="s2">of it and that that that&#39;s what helps</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.590" end="00:31:37.350" style="s2">that it helps avoid it helps avoid the</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.930" end="00:31:39.870" style="s2">absurd aspect of existentialism in my in</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.350" end="00:31:42.120" style="s2">my opinion at least I&#39;d love to ask you</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.870" end="00:31:44.550" style="s2">because I heard the interviewed Paul van</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.120" end="00:31:46.050" style="s2">der clay recently and he he said</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.550" end="00:31:49.530" style="s2">something along these lines I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.050" end="00:31:53.340" style="s2">after the interview that it all comes</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.530" end="00:31:55.050" style="s2">down to the resurrection that and I</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.340" end="00:31:57.240" style="s2">think he may have sent me a quote I may</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.050" end="00:31:58.860" style="s2">have seen a quote that said if the</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.240" end="00:32:01.500" style="s2">resurrection didn&#39;t happen then every</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.860" end="00:32:03.360" style="s2">Christian is a fool or something like</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.500" end="00:32:06.060" style="s2">that do you want do you understand what</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.360" end="00:32:10.800" style="s2">that means from a from a theological</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.060" end="00:32:12.270" style="s2">perspective I mean yeah I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.800" end="00:32:14.340" style="s2">therefore sure that the Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.270" end="00:32:15.930" style="s2">hinges on the resurrection hmm I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.340" end="00:32:21.060" style="s2">that&#39;s for sure</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.930" end="00:32:24.000" style="s2">I I I think that how can I say this I</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.060" end="00:32:27.240" style="s2">keep telling people to be a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.000" end="00:32:29.430" style="s2">careful when people think that they know</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.240" end="00:32:31.560" style="s2">what the resurrection is I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.430" end="00:32:33.900" style="s2">it&#39;s that easy to to know what the</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.560" end="00:32:35.880" style="s2">resurrection is I always tell people I</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.900" end="00:32:38.360" style="s2">believe the resurrection is an event and</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.880" end="00:32:43.520" style="s2">I and and I think that the text</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.360" end="00:32:45.720" style="s2">describes that event both in a very</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.520" end="00:32:47.400" style="s2">experiential way that the people who</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.720" end="00:32:49.860" style="s2">were there experienced experience the</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.400" end="00:32:51.840" style="s2">resurrection in an in a very extreme way</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.860" end="00:32:54.180" style="s2">the tomb was empty you know there were</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.840" end="00:32:56.310" style="s2">these encounters but it&#39;s it&#39;s also not</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.180" end="00:32:58.320" style="s2">that simple it&#39;s not as because people</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.310" end="00:33:00.360" style="s2">people think that the resurrection just</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.320" end="00:33:02.790" style="s2">means a dead body sitting up and walking</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.360" end="00:33:05.370" style="s2">out like that&#39;s not how it&#39;s described</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.790" end="00:33:08.000" style="s2">in the text Christ hides himself in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.370" end="00:33:11.160" style="s2">resurrection so after the resurrection</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.000" end="00:33:12.960" style="s2">Christ manifests himself to to these</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.160" end="00:33:15.420" style="s2">people and they don&#39;t recognize him and</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.960" end="00:33:19.020" style="s2">it takes a long time before they</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.420" end="00:33:22.290" style="s2">actually recognize Christ in his</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.020" end="00:33:24.480" style="s2">resurrection and so I think that that</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.290" end="00:33:26.430" style="s2">that in the story it&#39;s important to see</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.480" end="00:33:29.130" style="s2">that it was deliberately put in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.430" end="00:33:32.670" style="s2">story that whatever the resurrection is</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.130" end="00:33:35.010" style="s2">is not is not obvious it&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.670" end="00:33:38.130" style="s2">obvious thing and and sometimes people</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.010" end="00:33:41.070" style="s2">who want to reduce the resurrection to</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.130" end="00:33:43.890" style="s2">some kind of some kind of resuscitation</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.070" end="00:33:45.420" style="s2">right like some kind of someone passing</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.890" end="00:33:47.340" style="s2">out and you do CPR on them and then they</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.420" end="00:33:48.990" style="s2">sit up in the Nick off out you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.340" end="00:33:50.910" style="s2">their whether it&#39;s in their lungs or</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.990" end="00:33:54.210" style="s2">whatever like I think that that is an it</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.910" end="00:33:55.560" style="s2">is a very that&#39;s a very naive way of</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.210" end="00:33:57.330" style="s2">seeing it and some people can see it</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.560" end="00:33:58.740" style="s2">that way it&#39;s fine but I think that we</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.330" end="00:34:00.330" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t reduce it to that we should be</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.740" end="00:34:02.190" style="s2">careful not to reduce it to that but I</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.330" end="00:34:04.020" style="s2">do agree that the resurrection is the</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.190" end="00:34:06.390" style="s2">hinge of Christianity and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.020" end="00:34:11.730" style="s2">resurrection has to do with the idea</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.390" end="00:34:15.210" style="s2">that the world is essentially can</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.730" end="00:34:17.130" style="s2">participate in God that&#39;s what the</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.210" end="00:34:19.290" style="s2">resurrection means direction means that</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.130" end="00:34:25.169" style="s2">the created world the manifest world the</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.290" end="00:34:27.900" style="s2">the world of phenomena can embody can be</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.169" end="00:34:32.150" style="s2">a house for the infinite and can</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.900" end="00:34:35.190" style="s2">manifest the infinite and so it redeems</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.150" end="00:34:40.230" style="s2">the world right it makes the world</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.190" end="00:34:42.840" style="s2">participate in in in divinity and so if</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.230" end="00:34:45.060" style="s2">you look at the the last image in the in</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.840" end="00:34:45.600" style="s2">in Revelations like you follow the whole</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.060" end="00:34:47.760" style="s2">story</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.600" end="00:34:49.860" style="s2">the last image in Revelations I think I</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.760" end="00:34:52.050" style="s2">keep telling people that&#39;s the image to</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.860" end="00:34:53.669" style="s2">you help you to see what the result of</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.050" end="00:34:55.590" style="s2">the resurrection is in the end and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.669" end="00:34:58.440" style="s2">this it&#39;s the the New Jerusalem the</p>

<p begin="00:35:02.720" end="00:35:07.140" style="s2">around it and the city is made glorious</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.550" end="00:35:08.910" style="s2">right it&#39;s gold and jewels and</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.140" end="00:35:11.490" style="s2">everything so it&#39;s it&#39;s represented in a</p>

<p begin="00:35:50.369" end="00:35:53.970" style="s2">immediate experience of the world like</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.960" end="00:35:55.049" style="s2">how does that link to the mystical</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.970" end="00:35:56.970" style="s2">experience because what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.049" end="00:35:59.279" style="s2">describing is a mystical experience it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.970" end="00:36:00.450" style="s2">the same thing it&#39;s exactly the same</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.279" end="00:36:02.339" style="s2">thing so if you look at the same</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.450" end="00:36:05.789" style="s2">resurrection the idea that the mystical</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.339" end="00:36:07.549" style="s2">experience of oneness transcendence kind</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.789" end="00:36:10.079" style="s2">of the world glowing from within</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.549" end="00:36:12.839" style="s2">interacts with the world in a real way</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.079" end="00:36:14.549" style="s2">that&#39;s right it&#39;s exactly what it is and</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.839" end="00:36:17.220" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly what it is it so when you</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.549" end="00:36:19.829" style="s2">when you read the the Saint when you</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.220" end="00:36:21.839" style="s2">read several of the mystics they talk</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.829" end="00:36:24.299" style="s2">about how the resurrection is accessible</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.839" end="00:36:25.799" style="s2">already that we can already participate</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.299" end="00:36:27.630" style="s2">in the resurrection of the body that</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.799" end="00:36:29.760" style="s2">it&#39;s not that it is something which is</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.630" end="00:36:32.279" style="s2">at the end right and it&#39;s important that</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.760" end="00:36:35.010" style="s2">it&#39;s at the end because it encompasses</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.279" end="00:36:35.970" style="s2">everything and so it happens at the end</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.010" end="00:36:38.490" style="s2">of the world</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.970" end="00:36:40.410" style="s2">at the end of history at the end of you</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.490" end="00:36:43.200" style="s2">know time whatever you want to say</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.410" end="00:36:45.450" style="s2">because it is the final thing it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.200" end="00:36:46.890" style="s2">thing that encompasses everything so you</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.450" end="00:36:47.940" style="s2">could see it as encompassing the whole</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.890" end="00:36:50.490" style="s2">world but you can see it also as</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.940" end="00:36:53.359" style="s2">encompassing all of time and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.490" end="00:36:55.260" style="s2">why it&#39;s important that it&#39;s represented</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.359" end="00:36:58.589" style="s2">eschatologically that it&#39;s represented</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.260" end="00:37:01.260" style="s2">in the future in the final revelation</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.589" end="00:37:04.250" style="s2">let&#39;s say but what it is the cosmic</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.260" end="00:37:07.230" style="s2">participation in the the mystics</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.250" end="00:37:10.049" style="s2">experience it is a cosmic version of</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.230" end="00:37:12.270" style="s2">what the mystic experiences in his</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.049" end="00:37:13.619" style="s2">illumination and that&#39;s exactly what it</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.270" end="00:37:17.430" style="s2">is in that in and I could say that</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.619" end="00:37:19.170" style="s2">without a hint of worry that any at</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.430" end="00:37:20.789" style="s2">least orthodox theologian is gonna come</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.170" end="00:37:24.420" style="s2">in and slap me on the wrist because</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.789" end="00:37:26.010" style="s2">that&#39;s really what what what it is it</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.420" end="00:37:28.529" style="s2">also sounds pretty psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.010" end="00:37:31.230" style="s2">I don&#39;t know I&#39;m not I&#39;ve never done</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.529" end="00:37:33.270" style="s2">psychedelic so I don&#39;t I I know or the</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.230" end="00:37:35.779" style="s2">the the traditional versions of this so</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.270" end="00:37:38.609" style="s2">I don&#39;t know about the psychedelic one</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.779" end="00:37:40.470" style="s2">I&#39;m just I guess I&#39;ve discovered like</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.609" end="00:37:41.369" style="s2">this world is psychedelic with Jordan he</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.470" end="00:37:43.200" style="s2">always kind of sometimes he kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.369" end="00:37:44.970" style="s2">freaks me out when he when he thought he</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.200" end="00:37:46.829" style="s2">tells me things like he&#39;s I had this</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.970" end="00:37:48.480" style="s2">vision and he told me his vision it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.829" end="00:37:49.980" style="s2">funny because his visions are always</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.480" end="00:37:53.160" style="s2">quite coherent simple</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.980" end="00:37:54.690" style="s2">luckily you know and so I can I can&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.160" end="00:37:55.830" style="s2">like oh it&#39;s connected to this is this</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.690" end="00:37:56.400" style="s2">like you can show them what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.830" end="00:37:57.869" style="s2">connected to</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.400" end="00:37:59.359" style="s2">but it&#39;s just funny to think that</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.869" end="00:38:04.050" style="s2">they&#39;re due to mushroom so it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.359" end="00:38:05.280" style="s2">kind of like it&#39;s weird was the was</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.050" end="00:38:08.000" style="s2">there anything that we we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.280" end="00:38:10.770" style="s2">discussed yet you&#39;d like to to cover I</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.000" end="00:38:13.800" style="s2">don&#39;t know I I think I maybe I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.770" end="00:38:16.170" style="s2">kind of hear your take or your vision</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.800" end="00:38:18.030" style="s2">let&#39;s say of what are the challenges or</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.170" end="00:38:19.320" style="s2">the the opportunities of organized</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.030" end="00:38:21.780" style="s2">religion like what do you think are the</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.320" end="00:38:23.070" style="s2">problems and what you think or how could</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.780" end="00:38:27.410" style="s2">you see it at negative and positive</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.070" end="00:38:32.880" style="s2">terms let&#39;s say I mean it&#39;s clear that</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.410" end="00:38:35.280" style="s2">the the absence of a space and a reason</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.880" end="00:38:38.070" style="s2">to to come together is is something</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.280" end="00:38:40.560" style="s2">that&#39;s really we&#39;re really lacking in</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.070" end="00:38:42.060" style="s2">society a friend of mine created</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.560" end="00:38:43.710" style="s2">something called Sunday assembly</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.060" end="00:38:46.320" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve heard about it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.710" end="00:38:51.869" style="s2">a it was an atheist church or is an</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.320" end="00:38:53.430" style="s2">atheist Church so he&#39;s a stand-up comic</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.869" end="00:38:56.609" style="s2">and together with another stand-up comic</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.430" end="00:38:59.430" style="s2">friend of that his they they was like</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.609" end="00:39:01.170" style="s2">well why do why do only people come</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.430" end="00:39:03.090" style="s2">together for religious things why can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.170" end="00:39:05.820" style="s2">we create this is an atheist Church and</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.090" end="00:39:07.080" style="s2">the interesting thing is like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.820" end="00:39:09.630" style="s2">think I&#39;m speaking out of turn for him</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.080" end="00:39:11.310" style="s2">here is that they they created as an</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.630" end="00:39:14.550" style="s2">atheist church and it&#39;s become more and</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.310" end="00:39:17.990" style="s2">more spiritual as times gone on like</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.550" end="00:39:21.450" style="s2">they&#39;ve it&#39;s developed its own kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.990" end="00:39:23.520" style="s2">they realized how insufficient atheism</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.450" end="00:39:25.369" style="s2">was as a kind of organizing principle</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.520" end="00:39:28.890" style="s2">for a community to come together right</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.369" end="00:39:30.930" style="s2">and it sort of developed a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.890" end="00:39:34.410" style="s2">more of a kind of spiritual tone as</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.930" end="00:39:39.119" style="s2">times gone on but I certainly feel in</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.410" end="00:39:41.820" style="s2">myself that that lack of an organizing</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.119" end="00:39:45.600" style="s2">principle and that just there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.820" end="00:39:49.020" style="s2">something about like I went to Paul van</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.600" end="00:39:51.240" style="s2">der clays service in sacramento quite</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.020" end="00:39:52.670" style="s2">recently what I realized is my think</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.240" end="00:39:57.030" style="s2">this is something to do with our</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.670" end="00:39:59.609" style="s2">tribalism we need we need a context to</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.030" end="00:40:01.920" style="s2">be able to let our guard down there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.609" end="00:40:02.910" style="s2">sense that when we all go to church</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.920" end="00:40:05.670" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.910" end="00:40:07.200" style="s2">because we all tacitly acknowledge that</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.670" end="00:40:08.400" style="s2">we have the same value system but we</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.200" end="00:40:10.589" style="s2">have the same objectives that we have</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.400" end="00:40:12.780" style="s2">for the same reason it allows you to</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.589" end="00:40:14.549" style="s2">talk to anyone there like you</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.780" end="00:40:17.069" style="s2">immediately drop the bat drop the</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.549" end="00:40:19.440" style="s2">barriers where there&#39;s all in pretty</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.069" end="00:40:22.770" style="s2">much every other social situation apart</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.440" end="00:40:24.510" style="s2">from maybe a festival like a really good</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.770" end="00:40:26.700" style="s2">festival and not that doesn&#39;t always</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.510" end="00:40:28.890" style="s2">happen we always have these boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.700" end="00:40:31.289" style="s2">between us and them we need something to</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.890" end="00:40:33.900" style="s2">allow us to to connect with others we</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.289" end="00:40:36.299" style="s2">need an excuse so we need a context so</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.900" end="00:40:37.920" style="s2">that&#39;s what I think for me that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.299" end="00:40:41.670" style="s2">realized when I went to Paul&#39;s church</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.920" end="00:40:43.710" style="s2">was oh okay wherever you come from you</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.670" end="00:40:45.180" style="s2">can go into one of maybe an AAA meeting</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.710" end="00:40:48.420" style="s2">might give you the same experience like</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.180" end="00:40:53.309" style="s2">we all we need this shared context to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.420" end="00:40:55.079" style="s2">able to get over our our yeah our innate</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.309" end="00:40:57.299" style="s2">tribalism I think and that&#39;s what for me</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.079" end="00:40:59.220" style="s2">I recognized and I don&#39;t know whether</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.299" end="00:41:01.049" style="s2">it&#39;s possible to have that without I</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.220" end="00:41:04.349" style="s2">think you&#39;d have to have a religious</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.049" end="00:41:06.720" style="s2">framework of some kind for that or a</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.349" end="00:41:10.200" style="s2">shared a shared value system of some</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.720" end="00:41:13.589" style="s2">kind I don&#39;t know whether you&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.200" end="00:41:16.289" style="s2">suggesting that we need a renewal of</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.589" end="00:41:18.240" style="s2">traditional Christianity or traditional</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.289" end="00:41:21.230" style="s2">religion and I I kind have some sympathy</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.240" end="00:41:23.490" style="s2">with that but I also have a sense that</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.230" end="00:41:26.700" style="s2">probably for my generation and younger</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.490" end="00:41:29.130" style="s2">if there is something that that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.700" end="00:41:30.390" style="s2">fills that spiritual void that we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.130" end="00:41:31.920" style="s2">feeling that it&#39;s probably going to look</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.390" end="00:41:32.460" style="s2">somewhat different from from what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.920" end="00:41:35.849" style="s2">seen before</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.460" end="00:41:39.450" style="s2">hmm yeah I mean it&#39;ll be interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.849" end="00:41:41.849" style="s2">see how yeah how how it works out I kind</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.450" end="00:41:44.250" style="s2">of I think that I kind of see it in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.849" end="00:41:48.930" style="s2">long in a long term like I see it in a</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.250" end="00:41:51.480" style="s2">long story and so I already see let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.930" end="00:41:53.010" style="s2">say to me that the the Reformation for</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.480" end="00:41:54.839" style="s2">me was already kind of a problem in</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.010" end="00:41:56.760" style="s2">terms of what it did to the west it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.839" end="00:41:58.170" style="s2">like I think we&#39;re the product of this</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.760" end="00:42:01.349" style="s2">kind of breakdown I think one of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.170" end="00:42:03.359" style="s2">difficulties is when when the highest</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.349" end="00:42:06.240" style="s2">value that is that a society has turned</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.359" end="00:42:09.270" style="s2">towards when that starts to change like</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.240" end="00:42:11.430" style="s2">tries to fragment you can maybe hold on</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.270" end="00:42:14.250" style="s2">to the you can maybe hold on to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.430" end="00:42:16.109" style="s2">smaller communities because we still we</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.250" end="00:42:16.590" style="s2">have those small communities right I</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.109" end="00:42:18.600" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.590" end="00:42:20.010" style="s2">we have you kids like you said it could</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.600" end="00:42:21.870" style="s2">be an a a meeting it could just be a</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.010" end="00:42:23.610" style="s2">knitting group it could be an old ladies</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.870" end="00:42:25.920" style="s2">who go get together to knit right they</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.610" end="00:42:28.230" style="s2">have a common thing which unites them</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.920" end="00:42:31.760" style="s2">and makes them into a little community</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.230" end="00:42:35.190" style="s2">and I but I think that in order for</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.760" end="00:42:38.970" style="s2">larger in order for like that say all of</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.190" end="00:42:42.390" style="s2">society to have some form of capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.970" end="00:42:45.840" style="s2">interact there need we needs to agree on</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.390" end="00:42:47.460" style="s2">the highest let&#39;s say or at least work</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.840" end="00:42:49.170" style="s2">as hard as possible to agree on the</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.460" end="00:42:52.170" style="s2">highest and I think that that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.170" end="00:42:55.350" style="s2">think that&#39;s what the church offered</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.170" end="00:42:58.260" style="s2">let&#39;s say the West for you know like a</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.350" end="00:43:00.150" style="s2">thousand years let&#39;s say and and it was</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.260" end="00:43:01.350" style="s2">actually the only thing like in Western</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.150" end="00:43:03.300" style="s2">Europe was Western Europe was so dark</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.350" end="00:43:04.740" style="s2">and so convoluted and there was all</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.300" end="00:43:06.300" style="s2">these wars and all these barbarians</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.740" end="00:43:08.400" style="s2">coming down and everything the only</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.300" end="00:43:11.550" style="s2">thing that made it even to something</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.400" end="00:43:13.500" style="s2">like that made it somehow one was the</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.550" end="00:43:16.530" style="s2">was was the fact that we could at least</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.500" end="00:43:19.290" style="s2">all kind of agree you know this is what</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.530" end="00:43:20.670" style="s2">we&#39;re aiming to you know then the</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.290" end="00:43:23.700" style="s2">Incarnation is at least what we aim</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.670" end="00:43:25.950" style="s2">towards so I think that I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.700" end="00:43:27.180" style="s2">probably idealistic for me to think that</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.950" end="00:43:29.940" style="s2">that&#39;s what we would need like something</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.180" end="00:43:32.550" style="s2">that&#39;s why I tended to to return to to</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.940" end="00:43:34.620" style="s2">more traditional Christianity but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.550" end="00:43:41.280" style="s2">we&#39;re in a difficult situation for sure</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.620" end="00:43:44.190" style="s2">i I think I fear I think I fear that</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.280" end="00:43:45.390" style="s2">those smaller communities that we that</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.190" end="00:43:47.100" style="s2">there&#39;s going to happen it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.390" end="00:43:49.020" style="s2">happen again like it happened in in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.100" end="00:43:51.690" style="s2">20th century hopefully not as bad but</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.020" end="00:43:54.000" style="s2">that&#39;s what nationalism was right we</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.690" end="00:43:57.590" style="s2">can&#39;t agree on the highest on the</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.000" end="00:44:00.660" style="s2">highest unity and so are the one we can</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.590" end="00:44:03.090" style="s2">find that solid is our national identity</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.660" end="00:44:04.560" style="s2">so we kind of clumped around our</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.090" end="00:44:07.350" style="s2">national identities and then we had</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.560" end="00:44:09.870" style="s2">these crazy wars that you know that were</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.350" end="00:44:13.800" style="s2">there were nuts and so I feel like in</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.870" end="00:44:15.180" style="s2">the wake of World War Two as we you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.800" end="00:44:16.950" style="s2">it&#39;s just been two generations I was</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.180" end="00:44:18.990" style="s2">said like the last one the last veteran</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.950" end="00:44:20.760" style="s2">of World War two dies the last people</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.990" end="00:44:22.410" style="s2">that survived World War two</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.760" end="00:44:23.460" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna happen again because we</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.410" end="00:44:25.080" style="s2">haven&#39;t dealt with anything we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.460" end="00:44:27.150" style="s2">dealt with any of the questions that</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.080" end="00:44:29.900" style="s2">were being posed at that time so I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.150" end="00:44:32.150" style="s2">I have the same sense it&#39;s like also</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.900" end="00:44:34.790" style="s2">some Sun lessons after we learn the hard</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.150" end="00:44:36.590" style="s2">way like if you gotta have a lived</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.790" end="00:44:38.990" style="s2">experience of how bad things can get</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.590" end="00:44:41.420" style="s2">then it&#39;s very difficult to kind of even</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.990" end="00:44:44.990" style="s2">even think or articulate it to yourself</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.420" end="00:44:46.700" style="s2">yeah well let&#39;s hope let&#39;s hope cuz this</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.990" end="00:44:54.260" style="s2">one this this turn is gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.700" end="00:44:58.100" style="s2">artificial intelligence in it think</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.260" end="00:45:00.920" style="s2">about it too much I think that to me I</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.100" end="00:45:03.290" style="s2">think that that participating in</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.920" end="00:45:07.340" style="s2">something which has the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.290" end="00:45:09.890" style="s2">of kind of uniting things together I</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.340" end="00:45:15.080" style="s2">think to me that&#39;s been my drive back</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.890" end="00:45:16.340" style="s2">towards traditional Christianity so but</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.080" end="00:45:18.650" style="s2">I mean like I&#39;m Orthodox I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.340" end="00:45:20.960" style="s2">Catholic so I&#39;m also somehow</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.650" end="00:45:22.310" style="s2">participating in this weird this weird</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.960" end="00:45:24.530" style="s2">kind of fragmentation you know like at</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.310" end="00:45:26.450" style="s2">the same time I feel like there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.530" end="00:45:30.710" style="s2">of things in Catholicism which are which</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.450" end="00:45:32.870" style="s2">are off and so and I think orthodoxy has</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.710" end="00:45:34.880" style="s2">more of that mystical vision that I that</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.870" end="00:45:36.980" style="s2">I did I think is important to have as</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.880" end="00:45:38.570" style="s2">the central core like if you you have</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.980" end="00:45:42.230" style="s2">the mystical vision as a central core</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.570" end="00:45:47.410" style="s2">then then the world flows out you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.230" end="00:45:47.410" style="s2">in them in a more ordered way I think</p>
