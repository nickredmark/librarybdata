<p begin="00:04:41.680" end="00:04:46.810" style="s2">I&#39;ve ever talked to it was fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.690" end="00:04:49.210" style="s2">to sit down and get to engage with him</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.810" end="00:04:52.030" style="s2">it&#39;s as if I would ask him a question</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.210" end="00:04:54.039" style="s2">and I thought my questions were pretty</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.030" end="00:04:55.210" style="s2">well thought out and fairly bright you</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.039" end="00:04:56.680" style="s2">know I mean I knew I was gonna be</p>

<p begin="00:04:56.680" end="00:05:00.490" style="s2">their skull so I put some thought into</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.960" end="00:05:01.750" style="s2">it and I had a lot of stuff that I</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.490" end="00:05:03.820" style="s2">wanted to cover with him because I knew</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.750" end="00:05:06.070" style="s2">he had a very broad body of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.820" end="00:05:07.900" style="s2">but I&#39;d drop a question and he&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.070" end="00:05:09.669" style="s2">basically break it down into eight parts</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.900" end="00:05:12.159" style="s2">and then proceeded to just run circles</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.669" end="00:05:14.830" style="s2">around me it was like he was like doing</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.159" end="00:05:16.480" style="s2">donuts around my brain just like</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.830" end="00:05:18.490" style="s2">oh you know and I&#39;m not being</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.480" end="00:05:22.090" style="s2">self-deprecating at all I think I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.490" end="00:05:24.480" style="s2">fairly smart guy but he&#39;s on another</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.090" end="00:05:28.600" style="s2">level but what&#39;s really cool about</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.480" end="00:05:30.280" style="s2">Daniel is a he&#39;s super humble and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.600" end="00:05:31.930" style="s2">also got a lot of heart he&#39;s someone</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.280" end="00:05:34.120" style="s2">who&#39;s been you know deeply into</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.930" end="00:05:36.880" style="s2">meditation and metaphysics for a long</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.120" end="00:05:39.850" style="s2">time so he has this really warm friendly</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.880" end="00:05:42.070" style="s2">spiritual vibe but he&#39;s also highly</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.850" end="00:05:45.640" style="s2">analytical and scientific and the way</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.070" end="00:05:48.790" style="s2">that he approaches the woes of mankind</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.640" end="00:05:51.610" style="s2">is very fascinating because he zooms way</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.790" end="00:05:53.560" style="s2">out and looks at everything from a</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.610" end="00:05:55.420" style="s2">systems perspective and that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.560" end="00:05:58.360" style="s2">his whole model and so when he looks at</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.420" end="00:06:00.340" style="s2">the human body our cognition nootropics</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.360" end="00:06:01.840" style="s2">all the stuff that we get into he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.340" end="00:06:04.570" style="s2">really looking at the whole body as a</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.840" end="00:06:06.760" style="s2">system and then the goal being once</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.570" end="00:06:08.890" style="s2">you&#39;ve kind of upgraded your system and</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.760" end="00:06:11.140" style="s2">you&#39;re optimized then what are you going</p>

<p begin="00:06:24.520" end="00:06:30.610" style="s2">sort of portal of consciousness and we</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.180" end="00:06:32.470" style="s2">talked about homeschooling and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.610" end="00:06:34.330" style="s2">difference between that and the public</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.470" end="00:06:37.270" style="s2">school brainwashing that goes on and</p>

<p begin="00:06:41.800" end="00:06:46.030" style="s2">we we don&#39;t tend to like to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.570" end="00:06:48.700" style="s2">much so we really went into some of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.030" end="00:06:51.490" style="s2">systemic issues of our society and of</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.700" end="00:06:54.040" style="s2">culture and then went backwards and sort</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.490" end="00:06:58.440" style="s2">of reverse engineered that in this epoch</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.040" end="00:07:01.150" style="s2">talk in terms of our personal subjective</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.440" end="00:07:03.160" style="s2">mental health and well-being and how</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.150" end="00:07:05.200" style="s2">that we can get that on track in order</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.160" end="00:07:07.960" style="s2">to make a positive contribution to some</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.200" end="00:07:10.180" style="s2">of these larger social and cultural</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.960" end="00:07:12.100" style="s2">issues so this one really veers off kind</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.180" end="00:07:15.070" style="s2">of off track of it from some of my</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.100" end="00:07:18.790" style="s2">normal shows and this might represent a</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.070" end="00:07:20.320" style="s2">trend in 2018 I might you know leave the</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.790" end="00:07:22.630" style="s2">reservation a little bit here and there</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.320" end="00:07:23.860" style="s2">and go into some of these other areas I</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.630" end="00:07:25.180" style="s2">by no means want to make a political</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.860" end="00:07:27.790" style="s2">show because I&#39;m definitely not</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.180" end="00:07:28.630" style="s2">qualified but I think that there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.790" end="00:07:30.040" style="s2">to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.630" end="00:07:32.920" style="s2">when it comes to building the ultimate</p>

<p begin="00:07:32.920" end="00:07:37.150" style="s2">and society has a lot to do with that so</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.200" end="00:07:38.830" style="s2">that&#39;s the basic gist of it some of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.150" end="00:07:40.780" style="s2">other things we talk about that might be</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.830" end="00:07:42.250" style="s2">of interest to you and make your ass</p>

<p begin="00:07:45.910" end="00:07:49.900" style="s2">it&#39;s actually a glorious end because we</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.770" end="00:07:51.310" style="s2">really get into some deep stuff towards</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.900" end="00:07:53.050" style="s2">the end of the conversation but we</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.310" end="00:07:54.760" style="s2">talked about the fact that all human</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.050" end="00:07:56.560" style="s2">beings alive today basically have some</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.760" end="00:07:58.750" style="s2">degree of mental illness and what we can</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.560" end="00:08:00.970" style="s2">do about that some alternatives to</p>

<p begin="00:08:20.260" end="00:08:23.710" style="s2">to be privy to some of the launches that</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.300" end="00:08:25.690" style="s2">they&#39;ve got going on in the near future</p>

<p begin="00:08:37.750" end="00:08:42.880" style="s2">topics briefly which is geoengineering</p>

<p begin="00:08:48.130" end="00:08:53.020" style="s2">because I just I missed the blue sky</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.130" end="00:08:54.610" style="s2">that used to exist in the 70s when I was</p>

<p begin="00:09:33.550" end="00:09:36.610" style="s2">learned about you from reading about you</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.050" end="00:09:39.790" style="s2">and listening to you on other shows is</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.610" end="00:09:42.130" style="s2">that you were homeschooled that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.790" end="00:09:44.770" style="s2">and at the same time you&#39;re a really</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.130" end="00:09:47.620" style="s2">bright guy who is very knowledgeable and</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.770" end="00:09:49.270" style="s2">articulate I would consider you and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.620" end="00:09:51.520" style="s2">don&#39;t throw this term around but I would</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.270" end="00:09:52.900" style="s2">consider you to be someone that&#39;s highly</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.520" end="00:09:55.240" style="s2">intelligent to the point where you could</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.900" end="00:09:57.070" style="s2">be called brilliant and I don&#39;t call</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.240" end="00:10:00.130" style="s2">everyone brilliant you&#39;re a really smart</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.070" end="00:10:01.930" style="s2">guy so why did your parents elect to</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.130" end="00:10:05.650" style="s2">home-school you and what impact has that</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.930" end="00:10:08.620" style="s2">had on your on your you know a mental</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.650" end="00:10:10.150" style="s2">acuity so it was a educational</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.620" end="00:10:13.120" style="s2">experiment my parents were interested in</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.150" end="00:10:15.790" style="s2">and my dad particularly spent his life</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.120" end="00:10:17.140" style="s2">thinking about educational philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.790" end="00:10:19.510" style="s2">and human potential and how do we</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.140" end="00:10:22.750" style="s2">actually actualize human potential</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.510" end="00:10:24.400" style="s2">better and my mom had shared interests</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.750" end="00:10:25.779" style="s2">and different skills and so they they</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.400" end="00:10:28.330" style="s2">decided to take it on together and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.779" end="00:10:30.430" style="s2">experiment was what happens if we give a</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.330" end="00:10:33.040" style="s2">kid no curriculum at all no fixed</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.430" end="00:10:35.380" style="s2">curriculum so I didn&#39;t have English and</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.040" end="00:10:38.529" style="s2">social studies in mathematics and but</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.380" end="00:10:40.720" style="s2">just expose them to everything possible</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.529" end="00:10:44.080" style="s2">facilitate their interests and see what</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.720" end="00:10:46.959" style="s2">happens and so that was the experiment</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.080" end="00:10:48.730" style="s2">and having gone through the whole</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.959" end="00:10:51.160" style="s2">experiment we could do it much better</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.730" end="00:10:53.140" style="s2">now they were parents it got learned</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.160" end="00:10:54.339" style="s2">along the way but the effective parts</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.140" end="00:10:59.290" style="s2">that I would say we&#39;re a successful</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.339" end="00:11:01.510" style="s2">experiment is every kid has profound</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.290" end="00:11:04.420" style="s2">fascination with life in their own ways</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.510" end="00:11:07.300" style="s2">and we usually do a good job of breaking</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.420" end="00:11:10.230" style="s2">it and we also usually do a good job of</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.300" end="00:11:13.330" style="s2">training them not to think well so</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.230" end="00:11:15.130" style="s2">little kids ask what is that what is</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.330" end="00:11:16.330" style="s2">that what is that at first right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.130" end="00:11:19.029" style="s2">the first question they&#39;re getting the</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.330" end="00:11:22.240" style="s2">anatomy of universe down and then why</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.029" end="00:11:23.890" style="s2">why why and the depth of why run into</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.240" end="00:11:25.630" style="s2">philosophically and physically deep</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.890" end="00:11:28.360" style="s2">questions that we usually don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.630" end="00:11:29.410" style="s2">to answer and so we give them we just</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.360" end="00:11:30.670" style="s2">don&#39;t answer them or we give them</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.410" end="00:11:33.850" style="s2">answers</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.670" end="00:11:35.980" style="s2">made-up answers yeah but there are some</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.850" end="00:11:39.310" style="s2">less conscious parents who say because I</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.980" end="00:11:40.510" style="s2">said so yeah because it just is or God</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.310" end="00:11:42.610" style="s2">made it that way or whatever so when</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.510" end="00:11:44.470" style="s2">ready to asks why is the sky blue and</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.610" end="00:11:46.630" style="s2">most adults realize they don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.470" end="00:11:48.160" style="s2">know something that is that fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.630" end="00:11:50.680" style="s2">to our experience every day right and</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.160" end="00:11:53.410" style="s2">all human experience they either say I</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.680" end="00:11:54.790" style="s2">don&#39;t know how do you spell cat right</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.410" end="00:11:55.960" style="s2">like they move it into the domain of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.790" end="00:11:57.850" style="s2">gnome but they move it from something</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.960" end="00:12:00.150" style="s2">that was fundamental about the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.850" end="00:12:02.800" style="s2">universe to something that wasn&#39;t and so</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.150" end="00:12:04.720" style="s2">if you really want to explain why the</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.800" end="00:12:07.180" style="s2">sky is blue you have to understand that</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.720" end="00:12:08.980" style="s2">our upper atmosphere is made of nitrogen</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.180" end="00:12:11.050" style="s2">and oxygen and the percentage of it and</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.980" end="00:12:13.180" style="s2">nitrogen specifically as n2 and how</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.050" end="00:12:14.950" style="s2">molecules work and how light coming from</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.180" end="00:12:16.330" style="s2">the Sun works and the speed of light and</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.950" end="00:12:18.700" style="s2">diffraction and understanding what</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.330" end="00:12:20.740" style="s2">optics is and it like there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.700" end="00:12:22.540" style="s2">deep things and then the wait that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.740" end="00:12:24.340" style="s2">it is that specific wavelength but why</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.540" end="00:12:25.810" style="s2">do I subjectively experience it as blue</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.340" end="00:12:27.910" style="s2">so now we&#39;re looking at the mind brain</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.810" end="00:12:29.640" style="s2">interface right and the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.910" end="00:12:32.050" style="s2">between consciousness and physics and</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.640" end="00:12:33.760" style="s2">kids want to know that right they want</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.050" end="00:12:35.440" style="s2">to know why is fire hot which again is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.760" end="00:12:38.050" style="s2"> deep question and they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.440" end="00:12:39.640" style="s2">every kid asks these things and since we</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.050" end="00:12:42.010" style="s2">don&#39;t know we don&#39;t facilitate what</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.640" end="00:12:44.410" style="s2">they&#39;re naturally fascinated in that if</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.010" end="00:12:46.000" style="s2">hasni by and we force them to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.410" end="00:12:48.880" style="s2">interested in stuff that is totally not</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.000" end="00:12:50.380" style="s2">interesting and in doing so we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.880" end="00:12:51.430" style="s2">teach them the interesting things we</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.380" end="00:12:53.020" style="s2">don&#39;t teach them the things that are</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.430" end="00:12:54.700" style="s2">foundational about life that actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.020" end="00:12:56.590" style="s2">lead to the ability to understand</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.700" end="00:12:58.420" style="s2">everything else and we actually break</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.590" end="00:13:00.120" style="s2">their interest in life which is why then</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.420" end="00:13:03.160" style="s2">they just want to veg out watch TV or</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.120" end="00:13:05.500" style="s2">you know the the whole welfare person</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.160" end="00:13:07.110" style="s2">phenomena whoo yeah is actually I was</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.500" end="00:13:10.300" style="s2">gonna say they&#39;ve become great taxpayers</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.110" end="00:13:12.280" style="s2">but see those are broken people that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.300" end="00:13:14.770" style="s2">the key insight is that everyone has</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.280" end="00:13:16.540" style="s2">born fascinated interested and if you</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.770" end="00:13:18.220" style="s2">facilitate that then not only are you</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.540" end="00:13:19.750" style="s2">helping them learn a tremendous amount</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.220" end="00:13:21.130" style="s2">and you&#39;re and they&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.750" end="00:13:22.840" style="s2">fastening about different things some</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.130" end="00:13:24.370" style="s2">more in the direction of aesthetics or</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.840" end="00:13:26.710" style="s2">ethics or fundamental science or</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.370" end="00:13:29.110" style="s2">athletics or but there will be a unique</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.710" end="00:13:31.840" style="s2">genius actualization if it&#39;s followed</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.110" end="00:13:33.640" style="s2">and so that was the experiment and we</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.840" end="00:13:36.310" style="s2">could go on about educational philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.640" end="00:13:38.770" style="s2">but one of the key like insights there</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.310" end="00:13:40.750" style="s2">is that we have an educational system in</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.770" end="00:13:42.580" style="s2">the u.s. right now and in most of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.750" end="00:13:43.880" style="s2">West that was built in the Industrial</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.580" end="00:13:47.190" style="s2">Revolution to make</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.880" end="00:13:49.200" style="s2">Industrial thoughts and it was the thank</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.190" end="00:13:51.360" style="s2">you no I love going here I was hoping I</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.200" end="00:13:55.500" style="s2">was hoping we could get into this carry</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.360" end="00:13:57.420" style="s2">on please and so as we started to look</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.500" end="00:14:00.570" style="s2">at building industrial supply chains</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.420" end="00:14:02.430" style="s2">then we wanted every assembly line</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.570" end="00:14:04.500" style="s2">worker before we had automated that task</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.430" end="00:14:06.600" style="s2">to basically be anatomica right they</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.500" end="00:14:08.280" style="s2">would do the exact same thing and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.600" end="00:14:10.170" style="s2">anyone who had been trained into doing</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.280" end="00:14:11.610" style="s2">that could be replaceable</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.170" end="00:14:14.130" style="s2">they were fungible for anyone else and</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.610" end="00:14:15.930" style="s2">any MBA from a good business school was</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.130" end="00:14:17.670" style="s2">replaceable for any other MBA and the VP</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.930" end="00:14:19.560" style="s2">of Marketing and so we want to take</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.670" end="00:14:22.740" style="s2">unique humans and collapse them into</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.560" end="00:14:23.790" style="s2">fungible roles and so then we can just</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.740" end="00:14:25.080" style="s2">have an org chart and say I&#39;m looking</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.790" end="00:14:27.600" style="s2">for three of these and four of these</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.080" end="00:14:28.770" style="s2">totally replaceable in the process of</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.600" end="00:14:31.050" style="s2">doing that when you collapse the</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.770" end="00:14:33.510" style="s2">uniqueness of a human to a fungible role</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.050" end="00:14:36.120" style="s2">there&#39;s of course the intrinsic motive</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.510" end="00:14:37.680" style="s2">to do that is gone deep competition in</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.120" end="00:14:39.150" style="s2">comparison because we&#39;re competing on</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.680" end="00:14:40.590" style="s2">being the exact same role so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.150" end="00:14:42.630" style="s2">competing on the same metrics rather</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.590" end="00:14:45.300" style="s2">than any uniqueness like there&#39;s no way</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.630" end="00:14:48.270" style="s2">to compare Salvador Dali and MC Escher</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.300" end="00:14:50.130" style="s2">in DaVinci because how the would</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.270" end="00:14:52.110" style="s2">you do that right like there you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.130" end="00:14:54.590" style="s2">compare them on the same metrics and if</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.110" end="00:14:56.700" style="s2">like if Dali hadn&#39;t done what he did</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.590" end="00:14:58.140" style="s2">some other artists wouldn&#39;t have done</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.700" end="00:15:00.060" style="s2">the same thing universe would just have</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.140" end="00:15:01.620" style="s2">been less that was the uniqueness of</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.060" end="00:15:02.940" style="s2">that being expressing in a totally</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.620" end="00:15:04.680" style="s2"> unique way which is why all</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.940" end="00:15:07.860" style="s2">artists for history hadn&#39;t done that</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.680" end="00:15:10.080" style="s2">thing and so so much of the jealousy and</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.860" end="00:15:11.820" style="s2">the comparison competition also comes</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.080" end="00:15:13.920" style="s2">from being collapsed to categories and</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.820" end="00:15:16.110" style="s2">there were reasons why we did this as we</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.920" end="00:15:18.570" style="s2">you know for all of human history until</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.110" end="00:15:20.880" style="s2">not that long ago until the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.570" end="00:15:22.770" style="s2">what we call civilization 10,000 years</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.880" end="00:15:24.840" style="s2">ago give or take for 8 million years of</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.770" end="00:15:27.210" style="s2">hominid history we never had got more</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.840" end="00:15:29.310" style="s2">than 150 people and those hundred and</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.210" end="00:15:30.780" style="s2">fifty person tribes everyone could be</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.310" end="00:15:33.000" style="s2">pretty unique and that should get along</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.780" end="00:15:34.320" style="s2">well because they knew everybody else</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.000" end="00:15:35.880" style="s2">and they could actually keep track of it</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.320" end="00:15:38.490" style="s2">and as soon as we want to go to start</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.880" end="00:15:40.380" style="s2">having very large numbers we had to</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.490" end="00:15:41.670" style="s2">create some homogeneity between everyone</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.380" end="00:15:43.890" style="s2">so we started making them a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.670" end="00:15:45.090" style="s2">like termites or ants which are animals</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.890" end="00:15:47.550" style="s2">that can do a lot of them working</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.090" end="00:15:49.380" style="s2">together but within a class a worker ant</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.550" end="00:15:50.520" style="s2">or a groan ant they&#39;re all federal right</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.380" end="00:15:53.130" style="s2">they&#39;re all replaceable for each other</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.520" end="00:15:54.990" style="s2">so this system is very much like that in</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.130" end="00:15:56.970" style="s2">education is the indoctrination into</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.990" end="00:16:02.370" style="s2">being going from a unique human to</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.970" end="00:16:04.230" style="s2">but dude you just described my hole in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.370" end="00:16:07.019" style="s2">very deeply intellectual way my whole</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.230" end="00:16:09.350" style="s2">experience subjectively with education</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.019" end="00:16:11.579" style="s2">and the whole time you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.350" end="00:16:15.269" style="s2">caste and this is why I do what I do</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.579" end="00:16:18.149" style="s2">because I&#39;m so curious and so fascinated</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.269" end="00:16:21.720" style="s2">by the way things work and what the</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.149" end="00:16:25.550" style="s2">questions of why right and so I was</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.720" end="00:16:28.199" style="s2">always seeking truth even as a kid like</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.550" end="00:16:30.600" style="s2">how does this work why does it work but</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.199" end="00:16:33.300" style="s2">the system that I was put into and</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.600" end="00:16:36.000" style="s2">literally physically the desks I was put</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.300" end="00:16:38.250" style="s2">into we&#39;re like little torture chambers</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.000" end="00:16:41.699" style="s2">and and my creativity was actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.250" end="00:16:43.410" style="s2">discouraged and and was almost forced</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.699" end="00:16:45.180" style="s2">you know forced to join the basketball</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.410" end="00:16:46.529" style="s2">team because I was having behavioral</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.180" end="00:16:48.120" style="s2">problems and their solution was like</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.529" end="00:16:49.949" style="s2">cool make him conform to something that</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.120" end="00:16:51.779" style="s2">makes him even more insecure and feel</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.949" end="00:16:54.149" style="s2">like even more of an outsider being the</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.779" end="00:16:56.310" style="s2">kid with long hair and refusing to wear</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.149" end="00:16:58.019" style="s2">the right shoes I wore my vans and slid</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.310" end="00:16:59.939" style="s2">around the court and got made fun of and</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.019" end="00:17:02.100" style="s2">you know harassed and picked on and</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.939" end="00:17:04.110" style="s2">stuff like that and it&#39;s like once I</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.100" end="00:17:05.909" style="s2">turned the day turned 18 I quit high</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.110" end="00:17:07.409" style="s2">school I was marking it off on my</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.909" end="00:17:08.939" style="s2">calendar like a prisoner you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.409" end="00:17:11.270" style="s2">putting notches on the wall is like</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.939" end="00:17:13.980" style="s2">marking the calendar to October 29th</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.270" end="00:17:16.049" style="s2">1988 and that was the day of freedom and</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.980" end="00:17:18.929" style="s2">from that moment on once I left school</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.049" end="00:17:20.909" style="s2">then I became obsessed with learning and</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.929" end="00:17:23.059" style="s2">so it&#39;s so interesting to look from the</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.909" end="00:17:26.579" style="s2">standpoint of your perspective because</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.059" end="00:17:27.959" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t it I didn&#39;t want to learn it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.579" end="00:17:30.600" style="s2">that I didn&#39;t want to learn that way</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.959" end="00:17:32.850" style="s2">those topics and those topics yeah no</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.600" end="00:17:35.400" style="s2">way yes and so now it&#39;s like you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.850" end="00:17:38.760" style="s2">here I&#39;m 47 and I&#39;m like I&#39;m like the</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.400" end="00:17:40.650" style="s2">most curious childlike energy I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.760" end="00:17:42.030" style="s2">there is I mean I don&#39;t know anyone</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.650" end="00:17:43.590" style="s2">that&#39;s as curious is me about the way</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.030" end="00:17:45.960" style="s2">things work and it&#39;s such a gift to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.590" end="00:17:49.049" style="s2">able to interview people and and really</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.960" end="00:17:51.000" style="s2">learn about this stuff so so that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.049" end="00:17:53.309" style="s2">no note how fortuitous that your parents</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.000" end="00:17:55.320" style="s2">you know you were so situated that your</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.309" end="00:17:57.210" style="s2">parents got that you had an opportunity</p>

<p begin="00:19:16.860" end="00:19:19.560" style="s2">you were able to say I don&#39;t want</p>

<p begin="00:19:23.130" end="00:19:28.320" style="s2">and there was this I gotta find this</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.080" end="00:19:29.580" style="s2">freaking it was some study or evaluation</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.320" end="00:19:31.280" style="s2">or paper or something that I came across</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.580" end="00:19:34.830" style="s2">at one point and it was talking about</p>

<p begin="00:19:47.310" end="00:19:53.880" style="s2">trend that the smartest people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.960" end="00:19:56.310" style="s2">think outside of the box and it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.880" end="00:19:57.870" style="s2">theory was that the people that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.310" end="00:19:59.010" style="s2">describing that are highly specialized</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.870" end="00:20:02.040" style="s2">and that rise to the top of their class</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.010" end="00:20:04.200" style="s2">intellectually that they&#39;re so smart</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.040" end="00:20:06.500" style="s2">that they&#39;re able to over calculate the</p>

<p begin="00:20:06.500" end="00:20:11.130" style="s2">creativity whereas if you have a more of</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.570" end="00:20:12.900" style="s2">a visionary creative type that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.130" end="00:20:14.450" style="s2">fit within that box but also obviously</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.900" end="00:20:17.610" style="s2">still has a certain degree of</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.450" end="00:20:19.290" style="s2">intellectual prowess that they&#39;re smart</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.610" end="00:20:20.970" style="s2">enough to have the idea and creative</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.290" end="00:20:22.040" style="s2">enough to have the vision but she</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.970" end="00:20:24.230" style="s2">doesn&#39;t dumb enough to not</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.040" end="00:20:25.910" style="s2">to calculate the risk and be willing to</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.230" end="00:20:28.640" style="s2">go out and walk the plank and lose it</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.910" end="00:20:29.930" style="s2">all for the sake of so saying dumb</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.640" end="00:20:32.120" style="s2">enough is one way of thinking of it</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.930" end="00:20:33.440" style="s2">another way of thinking of it has to do</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.120" end="00:20:36.140" style="s2">with the way they&#39;re trained in</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.440" end="00:20:38.450" style="s2">relationship to risk aversion okay okay</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.140" end="00:20:39.860" style="s2">I like that cuz I think of myself as</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.450" end="00:20:43.070" style="s2">that and I tend to be self-deprecating</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.860" end="00:20:45.530" style="s2">so I appreciate you seeing in an NLP</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.070" end="00:20:47.330" style="s2">wave seeing that word dumb enough so</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.530" end="00:20:52.040" style="s2">what is really happening think about</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.330" end="00:20:54.380" style="s2">this if the kids would get to 4.0 one of</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.040" end="00:20:57.170" style="s2">the keys of getting a 4.0 is making no</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.380" end="00:20:58.880" style="s2">mistakes right like that&#39;s how you</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.170" end="00:21:00.050" style="s2">that&#39;s how you write that is that you</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.880" end="00:21:02.510" style="s2">did everything right and everything</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.050" end="00:21:04.070" style="s2">perfect now everything right means you</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.510" end="00:21:05.990" style="s2">learned what had already been figured</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.070" end="00:21:09.050" style="s2">out was the Orthodox truth and you were</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.990" end="00:21:11.120" style="s2">able to repeat it effectively right and</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.050" end="00:21:12.740" style="s2">then at a certain point once you</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.120" end="00:21:15.080" style="s2">understand that system completely enough</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.740" end="00:21:17.990" style="s2">you can extend it a little bit which you</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.080" end="00:21:20.060" style="s2">know in the postdoc level you take the</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.990" end="00:21:21.860" style="s2">current whatever the field is an</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.060" end="00:21:23.470" style="s2">extended a tiny bit after proving that</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.860" end="00:21:27.800" style="s2">you understood it you know perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.470" end="00:21:29.720" style="s2">people who got a lot of praise and a lot</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.800" end="00:21:31.250" style="s2">of success and identity around never</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.720" end="00:21:32.300" style="s2">making any mistakes and getting</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.250" end="00:21:35.300" style="s2">everything perfect</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.300" end="00:21:37.130" style="s2">are not oriented to do things that have</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.300" end="00:21:42.470" style="s2">a very high risk of failure that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.130" end="00:21:44.960" style="s2">created an odor so when when kids are</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.470" end="00:21:48.110" style="s2">praised for getting things right you</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.960" end="00:21:51.230" style="s2"> them up because a number of things</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.110" end="00:21:54.140" style="s2">one so think about this in general all</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.230" end="00:21:55.880" style="s2">the praise that kids get is when they do</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.140" end="00:21:58.040" style="s2">something that the authority wants them</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.880" end="00:21:59.690" style="s2">to do and has already designated as</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.040" end="00:22:00.920" style="s2">right and good and true right so whether</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.690" end="00:22:03.290" style="s2">it&#39;s the teacher the preacher of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.920" end="00:22:04.700" style="s2">parents they give praise for doing what</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.290" end="00:22:06.680" style="s2">someone else wanted them to do they</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.700" end="00:22:08.210" style="s2">almost always get punishment for doing</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.680" end="00:22:10.070" style="s2">things that made sense to them that they</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.210" end="00:22:14.270" style="s2">wanted to do so this is how you</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.070" end="00:22:16.460" style="s2">conditioned people to be good cogs</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.270" end="00:22:19.190" style="s2">within an authoritarian system where we</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.460" end="00:22:21.320" style="s2">defer our own agency our ability to</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.190" end="00:22:22.970" style="s2">assess the world in our own agency to</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.320" end="00:22:24.920" style="s2">somebody that knows better than us and</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.970" end="00:22:26.210" style="s2">the teacher the preacher the parent</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.920" end="00:22:30.040" style="s2">right they all represent that and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.210" end="00:22:32.900" style="s2">it becomes the boss and the you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.040" end="00:22:35.600" style="s2">macroeconomy the state the etc writ</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.900" end="00:22:38.600" style="s2">large and so if we want people</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.600" end="00:22:40.190" style="s2">that actually can really be innovative</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.600" end="00:22:42.500" style="s2">we can&#39;t train them that way</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.190" end="00:22:45.860" style="s2">we have to train them to self-assess and</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.500" end="00:22:47.660" style="s2">self-initiate and not actually get hits</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.860" end="00:22:49.940" style="s2">of praise from getting something right</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.660" end="00:22:51.500" style="s2">that others already figured out and when</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.940" end="00:22:53.450" style="s2">we do that like oftentimes there&#39;s a kid</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.500" end="00:22:56.150" style="s2">who becomes a Spelling Bee champion or</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.450" end="00:22:57.830" style="s2">math genius because they just happen to</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.150" end="00:22:59.450" style="s2"> figure out like how spelling</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.830" end="00:23:01.460" style="s2">works or how math works and they got so</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.450" end="00:23:02.840" style="s2">much praise for it and they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.460" end="00:23:05.270" style="s2">getting enough unconditional love</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.840" end="00:23:08.059" style="s2">otherwise that they were optimizing for</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.270" end="00:23:10.429" style="s2">the extrinsic reward associated with the</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.059" end="00:23:12.740" style="s2">math of getting the praise even though</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.429" end="00:23:14.270" style="s2">they might actually hate math or be not</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.740" end="00:23:15.820" style="s2">terribly interested in that they just</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.270" end="00:23:18.740" style="s2">happened to get it if you didn&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.820" end="00:23:20.059" style="s2">then you might find math is alright but</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.740" end="00:23:21.710" style="s2">they&#39;re actually fascinated by art and</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.059" end="00:23:23.299" style="s2">so then they can become very good at</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.710" end="00:23:26.510" style="s2">something they have no passion for and</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.299" end="00:23:30.799" style="s2">it&#39;s all based on extrinsic motive that</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.510" end="00:23:32.750" style="s2">is damaging intrinsic motive Wow do you</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.799" end="00:23:35.659" style="s2">have kids I don&#39;t have kids</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.750" end="00:23:37.190" style="s2">like you&#39;d be a great dad dude I was</p>

<p begin="00:23:37.190" end="00:23:41.480" style="s2">so well developed if and when you have</p>

<p begin="00:23:43.130" end="00:23:48.289" style="s2">like terrified of not doing a good job</p>

<p begin="00:23:48.289" end="00:23:53.270" style="s2">doing so much work on myself but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.990" end="00:23:55.400" style="s2">interesting to think about a generation</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.270" end="00:23:57.020" style="s2">of people close to our age that have an</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.400" end="00:23:59.750" style="s2">understanding of things in this way that</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.020" end="00:24:02.990" style="s2">can actually assure in the next</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.750" end="00:24:04.669" style="s2">generation of human that is allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.990" end="00:24:07.940" style="s2">express their full potential without</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.669" end="00:24:10.909" style="s2">being confined into this system and most</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.940" end="00:24:12.530" style="s2">of the people that have the deepest have</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.909" end="00:24:15.110" style="s2">have had the deepest exploration about</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.530" end="00:24:18.950" style="s2">the nature of reality either aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.110" end="00:24:19.789" style="s2">having kids because they see how much is</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.950" end="00:24:21.890" style="s2">wrong with the world and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.789" end="00:24:23.450" style="s2">applying that creative and parental</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.890" end="00:24:24.620" style="s2">energy to trying to solve problems in</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.450" end="00:24:28.010" style="s2">the world or they don&#39;t feel secure</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.620" end="00:24:29.330" style="s2">enough in the world with nuclear war</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.010" end="00:24:31.039" style="s2">looming again for the first time in</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.330" end="00:24:34.970" style="s2">macroeconomic collapse and i&#39;ma change</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.039" end="00:24:37.429" style="s2">etc to want to bring kids in so okay so</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.970" end="00:24:38.780" style="s2">moving on into I mean there&#39;s stuff</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.429" end="00:24:40.340" style="s2">literally there&#39;s so much to unpack and</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.780" end="00:24:42.169" style="s2">any one of these topics but there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.340" end="00:24:43.850" style="s2">many things I want to cover with you but</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.169" end="00:24:45.049" style="s2">the education thing definitely piqued my</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.850" end="00:24:46.669" style="s2">interest just learning that you were</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.049" end="00:24:48.770" style="s2">homeschooled but you&#39;re really bright</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.669" end="00:24:50.690" style="s2">guy so where&#39;s the connection and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.770" end="00:24:53.030" style="s2">making sense the see I didn&#39;t go to</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.690" end="00:24:54.380" style="s2">college to me higher education was moved</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.030" end="00:24:56.480" style="s2">to Hollywood playing a band</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.380" end="00:24:59.360" style="s2">deal drugs done I mean I had it figured</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.480" end="00:25:01.370" style="s2">out so I thought then I went to LA CC</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.360" end="00:25:03.470" style="s2">for like two weeks I took health and</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.370" end="00:25:05.000" style="s2">which you know later I guess came to</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.470" end="00:25:07.220" style="s2">serve me if I only made it two weeks and</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.000" end="00:25:08.690" style="s2">I took health and classical guitar I was</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.220" end="00:25:09.830" style="s2">like oh cool learn how to play rad</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.690" end="00:25:11.240" style="s2">guitar you go in there like oh we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.830" end="00:25:14.420" style="s2">gonna learn how to read music I was like</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.240" end="00:25:16.040" style="s2">no that&#39;s math I&#39;m out but when I look</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.420" end="00:25:18.590" style="s2">at higher education now just from what I</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.040" end="00:25:20.030" style="s2">see in social media there&#39;s this just</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.590" end="00:25:22.130" style="s2">where we are culturally is so</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.030" end="00:25:24.800" style="s2">interesting because this millennial</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.130" end="00:25:27.200" style="s2">generation I read something the other</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.800" end="00:25:29.500" style="s2">day for example that they surveyed a</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.200" end="00:25:31.160" style="s2">bunch of Millennials and 50% of them</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.500" end="00:25:34.070" style="s2">indicated that they would prefer</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.160" end="00:25:36.380" style="s2">communism over capitalism you know and</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.070" end="00:25:40.100" style="s2">there&#39;s this whole post-modernism and</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.380" end="00:25:42.080" style="s2">and Marxist ideas and all this to me</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.100" end="00:25:44.180" style="s2">really crazy stuff that this seemed to</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.080" end="00:25:45.920" style="s2">have seeped its way into higher</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.180" end="00:25:48.650" style="s2">education and you have this generation</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.920" end="00:25:52.360" style="s2">of kids that are in this weird Orwellian</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.650" end="00:25:55.220" style="s2">1984 thought police political correct</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.360" end="00:25:56.930" style="s2">insanity like what&#39;s the deal with with</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.220" end="00:25:59.390" style="s2">that right now and do you know what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.930" end="00:26:02.600" style="s2">talking about and and do you think this</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.390" end="00:26:04.810" style="s2">has been perpetuated intentionally or is</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.600" end="00:26:07.790" style="s2">this just a natural progression of a</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.810" end="00:26:10.060" style="s2">plus B equals C and how things have</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.790" end="00:26:13.190" style="s2">carried on all right that&#39;s it like</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.060" end="00:26:16.100" style="s2">quite a few really deep topics mixed</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.190" end="00:26:18.980" style="s2">together any that kind of unwound yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.100" end="00:26:20.840" style="s2">so post-modernism as one topic in its</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.980" end="00:26:22.940" style="s2">relationship to higher education okay</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.840" end="00:26:24.020" style="s2">the trend of higher education writ large</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.940" end="00:26:26.930" style="s2">and the other issues beyond</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.020" end="00:26:29.360" style="s2">post-modernism looking at macro economy</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.930" end="00:26:31.780" style="s2">and questioning capitalism and looking</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.360" end="00:26:33.980" style="s2">at other macro economic systems and</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.780" end="00:26:36.410" style="s2">generational dynamics that millenials</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.980" end="00:26:37.580" style="s2">are expressing are all important and</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.410" end="00:26:39.350" style="s2">they&#39;re somewhat tied but they&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.580" end="00:26:41.720" style="s2">for some different dynamics so in my</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.350" end="00:26:44.060" style="s2">classic interview style I just asked six</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.720" end="00:26:46.610" style="s2">questions under one umbrella yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.060" end="00:26:48.170" style="s2">we&#39;ll take a stab at any part of that to</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.610" end="00:26:49.550" style="s2">me I&#39;m just you know I&#39;m very zoomed out</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.170" end="00:26:51.380" style="s2">and I&#39;m looking at things that I see</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.550" end="00:26:53.180" style="s2">like that like wait kids don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.380" end="00:26:54.830" style="s2">understand communism doesn&#39;t work how</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.180" end="00:26:57.710" style="s2">did we get they heard you know it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.830" end="00:26:59.990" style="s2">it&#39;s so bizarre to me in this whole I</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.710" end="00:27:02.659" style="s2">don&#39;t know the climate of there&#39;s free</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.990" end="00:27:04.549" style="s2">speech being crushed unless the people</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.659" end="00:27:07.489" style="s2">agree with you like this sensitive</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.549" end="00:27:11.840" style="s2">snowflake weird safeSpace whole College</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.489" end="00:27:14.090" style="s2">thing okay so the issue as I see it is</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.840" end="00:27:16.220" style="s2">actually quite nuanced and complex and</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.090" end="00:27:20.389" style="s2">most of the reactionary simplistic takes</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.220" end="00:27:21.979" style="s2">on it are part of the problem so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.389" end="00:27:25.309" style="s2">explore this nuance all right mental</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.979" end="00:27:26.629" style="s2">so let&#39;s take the issue of race okay</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.309" end="00:27:28.609" style="s2">which is right at the heart of that</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.629" end="00:27:31.909" style="s2">topic we can look at race we can look at</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.609" end="00:27:33.679" style="s2">gender we can look at transgender LGBTQ</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.909" end="00:27:35.659" style="s2">we can look at any of those dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.679" end="00:27:37.009" style="s2">that are part of the identity politics</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.659" end="00:27:40.070" style="s2">part you&#39;re bringing up right now this</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.009" end="00:27:42.559" style="s2">is related to post-modernism and it</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.070" end="00:27:43.849" style="s2">derives some of its intellectual basis</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.559" end="00:27:46.369" style="s2">from post-modernism but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.849" end="00:27:48.019" style="s2">related to some other key things so if</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.369" end="00:27:50.149" style="s2">we look at race and we look at black</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.019" end="00:27:54.499" style="s2">lives matter or people of color movement</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.149" end="00:27:56.809" style="s2">or etc we have not ever properly dealt</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.499" end="00:27:59.359" style="s2">with the fact that this land that we</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.809" end="00:28:01.399" style="s2">call this country was fully inhabited by</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.359" end="00:28:04.729" style="s2">lots of Nations of people that we</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.399" end="00:28:08.119" style="s2">completely soldered to make this land</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.729" end="00:28:09.739" style="s2">right it was we&#39;re getting taxation</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.119" end="00:28:11.119" style="s2">without representation in London we</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.739" end="00:28:12.739" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be here anymore so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.119" end="00:28:14.029" style="s2">gonna go somewhere else and hey look</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.739" end="00:28:15.769" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole continent that&#39;s totally</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.029" end="00:28:17.239" style="s2">free because we have better military</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.769" end="00:28:19.489" style="s2">than equipment than they do so we can</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.239" end="00:28:22.039" style="s2">kill all those people and take the whole</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.489" end="00:28:23.779" style="s2">land there&#39;s a real moral</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.039" end="00:28:25.580" style="s2">problem - having your moral legitimacy</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.779" end="00:28:26.989" style="s2">as the United States of America and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.580" end="00:28:29.629" style="s2">beautiful Constitution Declaration of</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.989" end="00:28:31.869" style="s2">Independence being based on genocide and</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.629" end="00:28:34.190" style="s2">we&#39;re pretty happy to acknowledge like</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.869" end="00:28:34.549" style="s2">after Germany&#39;s genocide they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.190" end="00:28:36.679" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.549" end="00:28:38.090" style="s2">right there&#39;s a whole cultural thing but</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.679" end="00:28:41.269" style="s2">our genocide was not that long before</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.090" end="00:28:44.629" style="s2">and was more people there&#39;s a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.269" end="00:28:46.399" style="s2">people wow that&#39;s interesting and it was</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.629" end="00:28:49.159" style="s2">the genocide of the Native American</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.399" end="00:28:51.919" style="s2">people employing the slavery of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.159" end="00:28:53.960" style="s2">Africans and we mean real</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.919" end="00:28:55.609" style="s2">slavery like captured the people by</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.960" end="00:28:56.929" style="s2">military force killed lots of them</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.609" end="00:28:59.599" style="s2">tortured and killed lots of them</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.929" end="00:29:01.759" style="s2">lynching etc and we we don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.599" end="00:29:03.559" style="s2">really acknowledge that this country was</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.759" end="00:29:05.269" style="s2">built with that it was built with a</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.559" end="00:29:08.749" style="s2">pretty decent amount of Chinese slavery</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.269" end="00:29:14.359" style="s2">a lot of African slavery and one major</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.749" end="00:29:15.710" style="s2">genocide all right so then we&#39;ve got you</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.359" end="00:29:16.519" style="s2">know we have to fight a war to finally</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.710" end="00:29:18.769" style="s2">get rid of slavery</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.519" end="00:29:20.659" style="s2">that long-ago like really not that long</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.769" end="00:29:22.729" style="s2">ago where there are old people alive</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.659" end="00:29:25.609" style="s2">today that still remember elements of</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.729" end="00:29:28.909" style="s2">slavery dynamics right like that&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.609" end="00:29:30.830" style="s2">deal to get but then okay so we abolish</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.909" end="00:29:32.269" style="s2">slavery without abolishing the mindset</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.830" end="00:29:33.409" style="s2">that was associated with it so a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.269" end="00:29:35.149" style="s2">people didn&#39;t want to go on so then</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.409" end="00:29:39.559" style="s2">we&#39;ve got Jim Crow and segregation and</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.149" end="00:29:42.739" style="s2">all that and then we kind of overturn</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.559" end="00:29:44.719" style="s2">that kinda right but slaves actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.739" end="00:29:46.279" style="s2">economically work really well it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.719" end="00:29:47.749" style="s2">of nice to be able to have people do all</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.279" end="00:29:49.219" style="s2">the work and not get paid and be</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.749" end="00:29:50.749" style="s2">able to concentrate the profit margins</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.219" end="00:29:52.190" style="s2">and as soon as you don&#39;t want to do that</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.749" end="00:29:53.869" style="s2">with the slaves now people got to take</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.190" end="00:29:55.159" style="s2">you know other people have to take the</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.869" end="00:29:56.929" style="s2"> jobs and who wants the jobs</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.159" end="00:29:59.149" style="s2">and now you have to dilute the profit</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.929" end="00:30:00.320" style="s2">margin to pay minimum wages so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.149" end="00:30:03.589" style="s2">lot of people that just didn&#39;t like that</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.320" end="00:30:07.099" style="s2">right for legitimate understandable</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.589" end="00:30:08.659" style="s2">reasons and they could justify making</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.099" end="00:30:10.429" style="s2">another group of people different enough</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.659" end="00:30:14.119" style="s2">that slavery was better than their own</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.429" end="00:30:16.219" style="s2">sacrifice in that zero sum game dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.119" end="00:30:19.789" style="s2">right or near zero-sum games anemic and</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.219" end="00:30:21.649" style="s2">then we have okay so now it&#39;s not full</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.789" end="00:30:23.059" style="s2">segregation legally but that mindset</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.649" end="00:30:25.149" style="s2">still there and the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.059" end="00:30:27.679" style="s2">coming out of segregation have</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.149" end="00:30:30.259" style="s2">generations of trauma and no education</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.679" end="00:30:31.579" style="s2">and no inheritance right as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.259" end="00:30:33.320" style="s2">people who are coming from generations</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.579" end="00:30:35.089" style="s2">of Education inheritance and not the</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.320" end="00:30:37.999" style="s2">same types of trauma so we have the</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.089" end="00:30:39.859" style="s2">ghetto phenomena and what that means and</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.999" end="00:30:41.629" style="s2">we we know how epigenetic trauma works</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.859" end="00:30:45.019" style="s2">now generationally right we know how</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.629" end="00:30:47.959" style="s2">mimetic trauma works and so then we look</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.019" end="00:30:50.809" style="s2">at do we still have a system of systemic</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.959" end="00:30:52.369" style="s2">injustice yes we still have a</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.809" end="00:30:54.019" style="s2">system of systemic injustice and any</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.369" end="00:30:56.029" style="s2">white person who wouldn&#39;t just trade to</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.019" end="00:30:57.499" style="s2">be black recognizes that the ethics of</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.029" end="00:30:59.829" style="s2">the pie slice theorem aren&#39;t in place</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.499" end="00:31:02.719" style="s2">right pie slice theorem is if it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.829" end="00:31:04.729" style="s2">there&#39;s a symmetry right between you and</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.719" end="00:31:06.139" style="s2">I which is all kite the slice of pie and</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.729" end="00:31:08.479" style="s2">you get a pic which side but I don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.139" end="00:31:09.889" style="s2">a cut and pick right if I if I cut in</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.479" end="00:31:11.719" style="s2">pic there some up or you can cut</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.889" end="00:31:13.309" style="s2">and all pic but anyone who says I</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.719" end="00:31:14.599" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t want to trade positions with</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.309" end="00:31:16.820" style="s2">the other person but they should be fine</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.599" end="00:31:19.190" style="s2">with it there&#39;s a problem and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.820" end="00:31:21.589" style="s2">that&#39;s the dynamic here so there is a</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.190" end="00:31:24.229" style="s2">real response to unresolved trauma that</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.589" end="00:31:26.690" style="s2">is still affecting things now that said</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.229" end="00:31:29.359" style="s2">the response is coming from a place that</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.690" end="00:31:30.410" style="s2">has largely influenced by trauma rather</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.359" end="00:31:32.480" style="s2">than clear strategy</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.410" end="00:31:35.000" style="s2">and trauma usually perpetuates itself</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.480" end="00:31:36.230" style="s2">and so if a bunch of people of black</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.000" end="00:31:38.960" style="s2">lives matter is saying hey there are</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.230" end="00:31:40.430" style="s2">real issues where there are a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.960" end="00:31:43.640" style="s2">black people who are getting killed by</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.430" end="00:31:45.260" style="s2">police for reasons that are totally</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.640" end="00:31:46.880" style="s2">unfounded and then not getting</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.260" end="00:31:48.320" style="s2">prosecuted in the same way not getting</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.880" end="00:31:50.780" style="s2">attention in the same way like that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.320" end="00:31:52.190" style="s2">real deal and how does anyone go about</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.780" end="00:31:54.200" style="s2">trying to go to school and feel safe</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.190" end="00:31:56.210" style="s2">when you can be going to school doing</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.200" end="00:31:59.090" style="s2">all the right things and and have that</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.210" end="00:32:01.490" style="s2">kind of dynamic occur all right so then</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.090" end="00:32:04.820" style="s2">they go shut down a freeway out of like</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.490" end="00:32:06.290" style="s2">upset and anger whatever and then well</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.820" end="00:32:08.410" style="s2">that&#39;s trying to get attention for</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.290" end="00:32:11.030" style="s2">something that is real it is</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.410" end="00:32:13.990" style="s2">strategically problematic right because</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.030" end="00:32:16.760" style="s2">then you have the all right largely</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.990" end="00:32:19.640" style="s2">arising as a response to those type of</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.760" end="00:32:21.880" style="s2">dynamics saying look our way of life</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.640" end="00:32:24.740" style="s2">that we care abouts being threatened and</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.880" end="00:32:26.540" style="s2">look these people are rioting and</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.740" end="00:32:28.790" style="s2">causing chaos and whatever they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.540" end="00:32:31.640" style="s2">validating our ideas about them not</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.790" end="00:32:35.090" style="s2">being strategic good thinkers etc and so</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.640" end="00:32:37.040" style="s2">and because of a postmodern dynamic that</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.090" end="00:32:38.810" style="s2">in general the progressive left has it</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.040" end="00:32:40.790" style="s2">makes it harder for them to cohere</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.810" end="00:32:42.620" style="s2">because they want to validate everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.790" end="00:32:44.750" style="s2">perspective because they&#39;re suffering</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.620" end="00:32:46.520" style="s2">they&#39;re still in response to the pain of</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.750" end="00:32:48.770" style="s2">imperialism or one in perspective as</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.520" end="00:32:50.270" style="s2">imposed on everyone so part of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.770" end="00:32:51.560" style="s2">response is to say hey everybody</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.270" end="00:32:52.820" style="s2">actually as a perspective and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.560" end="00:32:54.440" style="s2">perspective that you&#39;re saying is just</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.820" end="00:32:56.600" style="s2">true because it&#39;s science or whatever a</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.440" end="00:32:57.950" style="s2">lot of our social science that arose at</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.600" end="00:33:00.770" style="s2">the same time as our physical science</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.950" end="00:33:04.700" style="s2">was actually just imperialism and so</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.770" end="00:33:07.040" style="s2">post-modernism emerged amongst radically</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.700" end="00:33:10.040" style="s2">simplifying here post-modernism emerged</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.040" end="00:33:12.860" style="s2">with a partial meaningful truth which</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.040" end="00:33:14.210" style="s2">was to say this is just objectively true</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.860" end="00:33:15.830" style="s2">this is science we did the right</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.210" end="00:33:17.900" style="s2">epistemology subjectively true and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.830" end="00:33:19.250" style="s2">true for everybody doesn&#39;t acknowledge</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.900" end="00:33:20.810" style="s2">that especially as we get into the</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.250" end="00:33:24.490" style="s2">social sciences there&#39;s a ton of</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.810" end="00:33:26.660" style="s2">bias right and so we went looking for</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.490" end="00:33:29.120" style="s2">monogamy and pair-bonding in the animal</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.660" end="00:33:32.270" style="s2">kingdom because of Victorian age ideas</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.120" end="00:33:34.550" style="s2">that actually made us do zoology badly</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.270" end="00:33:35.930" style="s2">right and so we like we see that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.550" end="00:33:37.550" style="s2">thing everywhere so post Martin said</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.930" end="00:33:39.980" style="s2">actually different perspectives on</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.550" end="00:33:41.360" style="s2">reality running different experiments in</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.980" end="00:33:43.520" style="s2">the building different kind of insights</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.360" end="00:33:44.340" style="s2">and we still know that are you</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.520" end="00:33:46.409" style="s2">healthiest</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.340" end="00:33:48.150" style="s2">a vegan diet or a paleo diet I can show</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.409" end="00:33:49.919" style="s2">you just as much research on</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.150" end="00:33:52.500" style="s2">both of those that look at different</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.919" end="00:33:55.590" style="s2">metrics right and so whether I&#39;m looking</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.500" end="00:33:57.270" style="s2">at pH or I&#39;m looking at insulin levels</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.590" end="00:33:59.039" style="s2">or I&#39;m looking at telomere level like</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.270" end="00:34:01.289" style="s2">I&#39;ll get different answers and also</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.039" end="00:34:03.299" style="s2">which populations but when I try and</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.289" end="00:34:04.799" style="s2">reduce health to some finite set of</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.299" end="00:34:06.929" style="s2">metrics and there&#39;s a million</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.799" end="00:34:09.629" style="s2">metrics that we can&#39;t calculate I can</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.929" end="00:34:10.859" style="s2">get a lot of partial answers that seem</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.629" end="00:34:12.960" style="s2">like the whole answer and seem like</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.859" end="00:34:14.280" style="s2">complete science because I&#39;m studying a</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.960" end="00:34:17.129" style="s2">very complex system a very simplistic</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.280" end="00:34:18.510" style="s2">way so bias is very easy when you try</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.129" end="00:34:19.830" style="s2">and set a complex system in a simple way</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.510" end="00:34:21.000" style="s2">because your metrics look really</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.830" end="00:34:23.389" style="s2">clear they just don&#39;t happen to be all</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.000" end="00:34:25.230" style="s2">the metrics that matter and so</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.389" end="00:34:26.940" style="s2">post-modernism acknowledged that and</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.230" end="00:34:30.990" style="s2">said hey all the perspectives actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.940" end="00:34:33.720" style="s2">have to be factored now there was a kind</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.990" end="00:34:37.710" style="s2">of virulent version of that that didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.720" end="00:34:38.790" style="s2">acknowledge there all the perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.710" end="00:34:40.379" style="s2">should be acknowledged but they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.790" end="00:34:41.940" style="s2">all going to be equally true some of</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.379" end="00:34:43.470" style="s2">them can have distortion in them so we</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.940" end="00:34:45.839" style="s2">need to be able to vet for distortion</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.470" end="00:34:48.560" style="s2">and all the perspectives are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.839" end="00:34:51.389" style="s2">less different in simpler systems so in</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.560" end="00:34:52.589" style="s2">chemistry the epistemology is more</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.389" end="00:34:54.659" style="s2">straightforward than it is in social</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.589" end="00:34:56.700" style="s2">sciences and some of the virulent</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.659" end="00:34:59.040" style="s2">version of post-modernism just started</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.700" end="00:35:01.710" style="s2">rejecting truth writ large right like</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.040" end="00:35:04.770" style="s2">any claim of truth as an imperialist</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.710" end="00:35:08.130" style="s2">claim and nobody can claim truth and all</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.770" end="00:35:09.960" style="s2">perspectives are equally true and but we</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.130" end="00:35:13.050" style="s2">can see that that was a virulent version</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.960" end="00:35:15.839" style="s2">of an appropriate response or a to abran</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.050" end="00:35:19.380" style="s2">the way that science imperialism</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.839" end="00:35:21.390" style="s2">capitalism along with fucking&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.380" end="00:35:23.910" style="s2">know colonialism right all kind of Co</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.390" end="00:35:25.470" style="s2">emerged and trying to untangle those was</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.910" end="00:35:27.380" style="s2">like part of the goal there so if you</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.470" end="00:35:29.910" style="s2">actually read Foucault or Derrida</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.380" end="00:35:32.130" style="s2">there&#39;s meaningful good thinking in</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.910" end="00:35:34.050" style="s2">there most of what you see happening</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.130" end="00:35:36.000" style="s2">that tries to intellectually reify</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.050" end="00:35:37.560" style="s2">itself with those people is not actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.000" end="00:35:39.599" style="s2">being done very well but that&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.560" end="00:35:40.890" style="s2">trauma is influencing a lot of it but</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.599" end="00:35:42.750" style="s2">then on the other side we&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.890" end="00:35:46.320" style="s2">actually taken responsibility to deal</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.750" end="00:35:48.900" style="s2">with that that trauma was created so</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.320" end="00:35:51.440" style="s2">when I say it&#39;s nuanced it is and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.900" end="00:35:54.359" style="s2">really big deal because if we look at</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.440" end="00:35:57.480" style="s2">they all the alt-right and the control</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.359" end="00:35:58.000" style="s2">left they have moved to a level of</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.480" end="00:36:00.340" style="s2">polar&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.000" end="00:36:04.120" style="s2">and radicalization that is very hard to</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.340" end="00:36:06.010" style="s2">imagine how that reconciles and with a</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.120" end="00:36:10.570" style="s2">tremendous amount of fear on both sides</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.010" end="00:36:12.940" style="s2">and trauma on both sides and associated</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.570" end="00:36:15.100" style="s2">with that the desire for secession from</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.940" end="00:36:17.110" style="s2">the nation the desire for whatever that</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.100" end="00:36:18.490" style="s2">leads to war in a world where military</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.110" end="00:36:19.690" style="s2">technology assets that we don&#39;t get to</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.490" end="00:36:21.370" style="s2">make it through Wars so what we did in</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.690" end="00:36:22.570" style="s2">the past and so the idea hey look we</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.370" end="00:36:24.730" style="s2">thought a war with the British to come</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.570" end="00:36:27.460" style="s2">get this area and it worked well yeah we</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.730" end="00:36:29.830" style="s2">have muskets right and as the</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.460" end="00:36:32.110" style="s2">military technology goes up it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.830" end="00:36:33.720" style="s2">more and more problematic and when we</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.110" end="00:36:36.990" style="s2">get to the level where you have</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.720" end="00:36:39.880" style="s2">decentralized exponential technology</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.990" end="00:36:41.050" style="s2">which is where we&#39;re at right now we</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.880" end="00:36:45.310" style="s2">don&#39;t get to make it through Wars</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.050" end="00:36:46.570" style="s2">anymore and humanity has always had</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.310" end="00:36:48.490" style="s2">different dynamics that led us to</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.570" end="00:36:49.840" style="s2">polarization and radicalization and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.490" end="00:36:51.460" style="s2">war and we have to actually learn how to</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.840" end="00:36:53.560" style="s2"> deal with that and part of it is</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.460" end="00:36:56.680" style="s2">we have to be able to understand how to</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.560" end="00:36:59.020" style="s2">take multiple perspectives they have</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.680" end="00:37:00.850" style="s2">partial truth find the successful parts</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.020" end="00:37:03.160" style="s2">and figure out how to do dialectic how</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.850" end="00:37:04.660" style="s2">to do synthesis and be able to find a</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.160" end="00:37:06.310" style="s2">solution that doesn&#39;t just solve for</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.660" end="00:37:07.720" style="s2">some things while externalizing harm to</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.310" end="00:37:10.450" style="s2">something else it&#39;s effective but</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.720" end="00:37:12.190" style="s2">actually solved for the whole set okay</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.450" end="00:37:15.040" style="s2">so that&#39;s just the post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.190" end="00:37:17.560" style="s2">snowflake part does that makes perfect</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.040" end="00:37:20.380" style="s2">sense because to me looking from the</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.560" end="00:37:24.660" style="s2">outside I&#39;m like I I see the trauma and</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.380" end="00:37:27.310" style="s2">I see that these young people that are</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.660" end="00:37:29.740" style="s2">wrapped up in that ideology I see them</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.310" end="00:37:30.970" style="s2">as victims you know and I but I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.740" end="00:37:34.390" style="s2">anything about the past I&#39;m just like</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.970" end="00:37:36.370" style="s2">you victims of a perspective that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.390" end="00:37:38.050" style="s2">adopted and I guess because there was</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.370" end="00:37:40.810" style="s2">trauma and I&#39;m just like God it feels so</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.050" end="00:37:43.840" style="s2">bad that this kid thinks the communism</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.810" end="00:37:48.340" style="s2">works it&#39;s just like yeah I want to</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.840" end="00:37:50.740" style="s2">address this part yeah when in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.340" end="00:37:52.830" style="s2">depression there were people openly on</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.740" end="00:37:55.480" style="s2">the streets discussing socialism Marxism</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.830" end="00:37:57.310" style="s2">lazy fair capitalism because the system</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.480" end="00:37:58.690" style="s2">was failed right you in a failed state</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.310" end="00:38:01.660" style="s2">people are open to like look at any</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.690" end="00:38:04.270" style="s2">possibility we are very near a failed</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.660" end="00:38:07.090" style="s2">state and we&#39;re actually very near a</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.270" end="00:38:08.920" style="s2">failed civilization globally so when you</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.090" end="00:38:11.050" style="s2">look at climate change and the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.920" end="00:38:12.550" style="s2">we can&#39;t get it right right</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.050" end="00:38:14.580" style="s2">like we can&#39;t get it right we keep</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.550" end="00:38:17.440" style="s2">driving ourselves towards the point of</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.580" end="00:38:20.770" style="s2">self induced catastrophe and possibly</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.440" end="00:38:23.230" style="s2">extinction and despite the fact that the</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.770" end="00:38:26.110" style="s2">Club of Rome identified this over</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.230" end="00:38:28.120" style="s2">shooting limits in this 60s right and</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.110" end="00:38:29.800" style="s2">and limits of growth in the world three</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.120" end="00:38:32.260" style="s2">models despite the fact that it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.800" end="00:38:33.580" style="s2">called out we&#39;re following the model we</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.260" end="00:38:35.650" style="s2">keep progressing on the</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.580" end="00:38:36.940" style="s2">model right the Paris Accord was not</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.650" end="00:38:38.620" style="s2">enough for us to make it we would have</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.940" end="00:38:39.640" style="s2">everything would have been if we</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.620" end="00:38:43.000" style="s2">did the Paris Accord and we couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.640" end="00:38:45.670" style="s2">even do that right and so and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.000" end="00:38:50.170" style="s2">driven mostly by our current structure</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.670" end="00:38:53.980" style="s2">of capitalism because if I over fished</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.170" end="00:38:55.600" style="s2">the ocean right if I use a mile long</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.980" end="00:38:56.890" style="s2">drift net and I take all these</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.600" end="00:38:58.900" style="s2">fish out of the ocean that&#39;s more money</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.890" end="00:39:00.400" style="s2">for my fishing company this quarter and</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.900" end="00:39:01.360" style="s2">leaving them in the ocean is worth</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.400" end="00:39:03.820" style="s2">nothing to me</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.360" end="00:39:05.500" style="s2">economically now it&#39;s worth something in</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.820" end="00:39:06.640" style="s2">the future but the other guy is going to</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.500" end="00:39:08.380" style="s2">fish them out if I don&#39;t fish them out</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.640" end="00:39:10.990" style="s2">so it&#39;s not like I can leave them there</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.380" end="00:39:13.570" style="s2">for the future so it is a competitive</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.990" end="00:39:17.470" style="s2">race for near-term wins</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.570" end="00:39:18.910" style="s2">mortgaging the future so we make</p>

<p begin="00:48:46.700" end="00:48:50.390" style="s2">stimuli right why it&#39;s so easy to get</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.980" end="00:48:51.920" style="s2">addicted to sugar because in an</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.390" end="00:48:53.630" style="s2">evolutionary environment we just didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.920" end="00:48:55.220" style="s2">have sugar right we had a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.630" end="00:48:57.950" style="s2">fruit and the fruit was not hybridized</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.220" end="00:48:59.630" style="s2">so so there was a major evolved opening</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.950" end="00:49:01.700" style="s2">reaction to get it because the caloric</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.630" end="00:49:03.170" style="s2">density offered increased ability to</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.700" end="00:49:04.220" style="s2">survive a famine now we have so much</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.170" end="00:49:06.200" style="s2"> sugar but we sell the same</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.220" end="00:49:07.880" style="s2">dopamine response that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.200" end="00:49:09.830" style="s2">dangerous phenomena I had one almost</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.880" end="00:49:11.780" style="s2">stimulate and then we find that of</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.830" end="00:49:13.190" style="s2">course social medias I - almost a</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.780" end="00:49:14.660" style="s2">million because everybody&#39;s pictures are</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.190" end="00:49:15.890" style="s2">prettier than they actually are</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.660" end="00:49:16.250" style="s2">and everybody&#39;s liking you and you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:49:16.250" end="00:49:19.190" style="s2">and you don&#39;t have to face like real</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.570" end="00:49:20.780" style="s2">difficulties of interaction and it can</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.190" end="00:49:23.120" style="s2">be a huge number of people in a short</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.780" end="00:49:24.680" style="s2">amount of time and porn is a hyper</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.120" end="00:49:28.430" style="s2">normal stimuli and there&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.680" end="00:49:30.140" style="s2">generation of kids becoming adults who</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.430" end="00:49:31.910" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to relate to women who</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.140" end="00:49:34.220" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to have sex properly who</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.910" end="00:49:36.800" style="s2">have issues erectile and etc because</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.220" end="00:49:38.240" style="s2">they have oversaturated a certain kind</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.800" end="00:49:39.950" style="s2">of stimuli and normal stimuli are</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.240" end="00:49:43.130" style="s2">actually very insensitive to it right</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.950" end="00:49:44.690" style="s2">and video games are hyper normal sense</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.130" end="00:49:46.130" style="s2">so we&#39;ve had a world that&#39;s just all</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.690" end="00:49:48.350" style="s2">hyper normals to deny which is addiction</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.130" end="00:49:49.730" style="s2">which always corresponds with less</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.350" end="00:49:51.410" style="s2">fulfillment right because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.730" end="00:49:53.450" style="s2">desensitizing you to actually getting</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.410" end="00:49:56.120" style="s2">pleasure from life and so you need the</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.450" end="00:49:57.860" style="s2">hyper normal stimuli to get the the hit</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.120" end="00:49:59.990" style="s2">and so you need the whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.860" end="00:50:02.150" style="s2">however many likes that your thing gets</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.990" end="00:50:03.890" style="s2">her and the hyper normal stimuli</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.150" end="00:50:06.110" style="s2">proliferate s-- in the presence of hypo</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.890" end="00:50:08.420" style="s2">normal stimuli which is we don&#39;t live in</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.110" end="00:50:09.770" style="s2">a tribe which is our</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.420" end="00:50:10.820" style="s2">evolutionary environment where we</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.770" end="00:50:12.290" style="s2">actually have real authentic</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.820" end="00:50:14.870" style="s2">interactions with lots of humans</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.290" end="00:50:16.040" style="s2">regularly and so imagine in a tribe</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.870" end="00:50:18.680" style="s2">where you&#39;re dancing around the campfire</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.040" end="00:50:20.120" style="s2">regularly most people find that when</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.680" end="00:50:21.920" style="s2">they go camping with friends they aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.120" end="00:50:23.060" style="s2">checking their phone as much right after</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.920" end="00:50:25.340" style="s2">the first day or two and the addiction</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.060" end="00:50:27.830" style="s2">kind of chills and the presence of more</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.340" end="00:50:32.840" style="s2">authentic fulfillment there is less</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.830" end="00:50:35.270" style="s2">emptiness pushing some hip and so the</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.840" end="00:50:37.250" style="s2">society we&#39;ve optimized for is a hyper</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.270" end="00:50:38.900" style="s2">hypo normal stimuli to everything</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.250" end="00:50:40.850" style="s2">meaningful where everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.900" end="00:50:42.700" style="s2">lonely and has some sense of</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.850" end="00:50:45.620" style="s2">meaninglessness and a lot of pressure</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.700" end="00:50:47.660" style="s2">you know together and so then in that</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.620" end="00:50:50.090" style="s2">place addiction is going to run rampant</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.660" end="00:50:51.710" style="s2">and most people have 30 to 50 different</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.090" end="00:50:52.670" style="s2">addictive behaviors meaning compulsive</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.710" end="00:50:54.470" style="s2"> they know isn&#39;t good for them they</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.670" end="00:50:56.540" style="s2">keep doing totally that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.470" end="00:50:59.330" style="s2">interesting because in the model of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.540" end="00:51:02.090" style="s2">12 steps which has been the the most</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.330" end="00:51:05.480" style="s2">effective single thing in removing</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.090" end="00:51:07.370" style="s2">deadly addictions from my life the model</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.480" end="00:51:09.350" style="s2">there is what I think people from the</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.370" end="00:51:11.210" style="s2">outside of that model think is that oh</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.350" end="00:51:12.500" style="s2">you go there and you quit drinking or</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.210" end="00:51:13.940" style="s2">you go there and you quit sex or</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.500" end="00:51:16.370" style="s2">overeating or whatever it is you go to</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.940" end="00:51:18.320" style="s2">some 12-step group and that that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.370" end="00:51:20.210" style="s2">your problem is but that you get there</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.320" end="00:51:22.310" style="s2">as subjectively one gets there and you</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.210" end="00:51:24.860" style="s2">go oh that was actually the symptom</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.310" end="00:51:26.780" style="s2">right so I&#39;m addicted to heroin well why</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.860" end="00:51:28.120" style="s2">because of everything you just described</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.780" end="00:51:31.030" style="s2">so is</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.120" end="00:51:33.970" style="s2">this set of principles then going to</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.030" end="00:51:35.830" style="s2">just take that addiction away know what</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.970" end="00:51:38.020" style="s2">it&#39;s going to do is it&#39;s going to give</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.830" end="00:51:40.030" style="s2">me a framework to live by spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.020" end="00:51:44.530" style="s2">principles ineffable laws right that I</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.030" end="00:51:46.750" style="s2">can apply to my life to become more</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.530" end="00:51:48.730" style="s2">fulfilled and then the need for that</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.750" end="00:51:50.260" style="s2">thing that I was using goes away and</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.730" end="00:51:51.880" style="s2">it&#39;s the straight I mean I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.260" end="00:51:54.310" style="s2">experienced this again and again and</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.880" end="00:51:56.380" style="s2">again using that model of getting the</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.310" end="00:51:59.580" style="s2">human connection and a spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.380" end="00:52:02.710" style="s2">connection and like living by those</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.580" end="00:52:05.680" style="s2">principles that kind of keep your mind</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.710" end="00:52:08.380" style="s2">and emotions in check then that problem</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.680" end="00:52:10.420" style="s2">is removed the principles represent a</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.380" end="00:52:11.620" style="s2">pretty small percent and the human</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.420" end="00:52:13.750" style="s2">connection represents a pretty large</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.620" end="00:52:15.850" style="s2">person mmm like the group dynamic and</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.750" end="00:52:17.500" style="s2">the group support I guess if that tribe</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.850" end="00:52:18.880" style="s2">we&#39;re missing right you walk into a room</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.500" end="00:52:21.220" style="s2">there&#39;s twenty five people in there that</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.880" end="00:52:23.410" style="s2">you might not know but they understand</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.220" end="00:52:25.570" style="s2">one another on a deep level because</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.410" end="00:52:27.070" style="s2">you&#39;ve both suffered in the same way</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.570" end="00:52:28.390" style="s2">think about it how many people get the</p>

<p begin="00:53:04.210" end="00:53:08.740" style="s2">all the time</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.640" end="00:53:11.650" style="s2">now just because this is adjacent to a</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.740" end="00:53:13.450" style="s2">topic I want to discuss this is one of</p>

<p begin="00:53:13.450" end="00:53:19.150" style="s2">social media and I&#39;ll say most gruesome</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.030" end="00:53:21.460" style="s2">about the topic of personal branding and</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.150" end="00:53:24.220" style="s2">I&#39;m using the word gruesome you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.460" end="00:53:25.540" style="s2">acknowledging a strong word I struggle</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.220" end="00:53:28.570" style="s2">with this a lot so I&#39;m looking forward</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.540" end="00:53:32.380" style="s2">to what you have to say when someone</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.570" end="00:53:34.240" style="s2">creates a brand as a business but even</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.380" end="00:53:35.680" style="s2">if not they&#39;re just social media and</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.240" end="00:53:37.350" style="s2">there&#39;s a persona right but let&#39;s take</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.680" end="00:53:40.030" style="s2">the brand as a very clear example</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.350" end="00:53:41.300" style="s2">they&#39;re now a life coach their yoga</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.030" end="00:53:43.220" style="s2">teacher they&#39;re an Instagram all</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.300" end="00:53:45.350" style="s2">or whatever the it is right which</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.220" end="00:53:46.610" style="s2">has become radically easier there used</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.350" end="00:53:48.530" style="s2">to be a few people to that with based on</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.610" end="00:53:51.350" style="s2">the media tech now everybody gets it to</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.530" end="00:53:53.930" style="s2">some degree of this then what happens is</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.350" end="00:53:55.460" style="s2">I have a feedback I have an analytics</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.930" end="00:53:57.500" style="s2">mechanism of how much people like my</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.460" end="00:53:59.780" style="s2">persona which is how many likes the</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.500" end="00:54:01.520" style="s2">thing gets and how many clicks and</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.780" end="00:54:04.430" style="s2">impressions and purchases whatever you</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.520" end="00:54:04.940" style="s2">know thing and so I&#39;m going to nail it</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.430" end="00:54:06.980" style="s2">test</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.940" end="00:54:08.030" style="s2">optimize my persona based on what people</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.980" end="00:54:11.750" style="s2">are responding to and they&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.030" end="00:54:15.140" style="s2">respond the hyper normal stimuli and so</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.750" end="00:54:17.510" style="s2">the brand is gonna get based on the</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.140" end="00:54:19.280" style="s2">financial driver based on the analytics</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.510" end="00:54:20.690" style="s2">is going to evolve in the direction of</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.280" end="00:54:21.950" style="s2">what gets maximum engagement it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.690" end="00:54:24.050" style="s2">get further and further from who I</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.950" end="00:54:25.610" style="s2">actually am there&#39;ll be whole areas of</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.050" end="00:54:26.600" style="s2">who I am that I definitely don&#39;t share</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.610" end="00:54:28.430" style="s2">because they will actually be</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.600" end="00:54:32.450" style="s2">anti-correlated to what gets the like it</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.430" end="00:54:34.250" style="s2">and the more people are liking that</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.450" end="00:54:36.680" style="s2">thing now that I feel different than the</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.250" end="00:54:38.570" style="s2">more depressed I feel right the more</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.680" end="00:54:40.700" style="s2">addictive desire I have in that</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.570" end="00:54:42.410" style="s2">depression that they&#39;ll get a hit right</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.700" end="00:54:45.110" style="s2">and put out another thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.410" end="00:54:47.120" style="s2">gonna get a your likes and the more I</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.110" end="00:54:48.350" style="s2">feel like a fraud and a phony and that</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.120" end="00:54:49.850" style="s2">if anyone really saw me they wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.350" end="00:54:52.070" style="s2">love me and I&#39;m really unlovable and etc</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.850" end="00:54:53.900" style="s2">right so in the 12-step room the</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.070" end="00:54:55.520" style="s2">opposite of that&#39;s happening right</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.900" end="00:54:57.620" style="s2">someone is actually saying I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.520" end="00:54:58.910" style="s2"> up I just did all this dumb</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.620" end="00:55:01.850" style="s2">and they&#39;re like I get it me too</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.910" end="00:55:02.480" style="s2">yeah woah a real human interaction just</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.850" end="00:55:05.510" style="s2">occurred</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.480" end="00:55:08.510" style="s2">yeah and which is rare yeah which is</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.510" end="00:55:10.970" style="s2">really rare and this starts to be the</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.510" end="00:55:13.760" style="s2">basis it&#39;s not sufficient right but it</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.970" end="00:55:15.500" style="s2">starts to be the basis of a human life</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.760" end="00:55:18.380" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t drive addiction as a way to</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.500" end="00:55:20.630" style="s2">deal with the emptiness right remove the</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.380" end="00:55:21.710" style="s2">emptiness and then the need to run from</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.630" end="00:55:23.960" style="s2">it goes away</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.710" end="00:55:26.690" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting how as you were talking</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.960" end="00:55:28.490" style="s2">about the the social media persona and</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.690" end="00:55:30.350" style="s2">the profile because I&#39;ve owned a company</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.490" end="00:55:32.660" style="s2">for nine years and it&#39;s it&#39;s a company</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.350" end="00:55:34.370" style="s2">and has its own identity and then myself</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.660" end="00:55:35.930" style="s2">and my partner were the drivers or the</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.370" end="00:55:37.730" style="s2">face of that company at a certain point</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.930" end="00:55:39.920" style="s2">but then we sort of phased out as we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.730" end="00:55:41.540" style="s2">gone in our own separate career paths</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.920" end="00:55:44.090" style="s2">and things and mine&#39;s gone away from</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.540" end="00:55:45.770" style="s2">fashion so I I really enjoy the process</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.090" end="00:55:47.330" style="s2">of building a brand and a personality</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.770" end="00:55:49.220" style="s2">and you know coming up with your core</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.330" end="00:55:50.960" style="s2">values in the mission and like it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.220" end="00:55:52.880" style="s2">thing it&#39;s a living entity which is been</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.960" end="00:55:54.330" style="s2">amazing but I really struggled when I</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.880" end="00:55:56.520" style="s2">started the podcast and</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.330" end="00:55:58.620" style="s2">decided to get out of you know having</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.520" end="00:56:00.000" style="s2">this identity as a fashion stylist and a</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.620" end="00:56:02.340" style="s2">musician and all the things that I was</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.000" end="00:56:04.530" style="s2">so identified with before that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.340" end="00:56:06.870" style="s2">just ran their course or weren&#39;t my true</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.530" end="00:56:09.120" style="s2">hearts passion and so I decided to do</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.870" end="00:56:10.440" style="s2">this podcast and make this brand called</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.120" end="00:56:12.780" style="s2">Luke story you know I have this thing</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.440" end="00:56:15.360" style="s2">the life stylist and you know I really</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.780" end="00:56:17.040" style="s2">had a hard time with launching it</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.360" end="00:56:20.310" style="s2">there&#39;s about two years ago because I</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.040" end="00:56:22.020" style="s2">didn&#39;t know how real I wanted to be or</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.310" end="00:56:25.740" style="s2">that I would have the courage to be and</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.020" end="00:56:27.510" style="s2">how forth coming and just transparent</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.740" end="00:56:30.180" style="s2">and authentic I wanted to be about my</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.510" end="00:56:32.190" style="s2">past and my struggles with addiction and</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.180" end="00:56:35.610" style="s2">just current struggles and everything</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.190" end="00:56:37.920" style="s2">and so I I kind of paused for a moment</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.610" end="00:56:40.920" style="s2">before I put anything out until I really</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.920" end="00:56:44.070" style="s2">was sure that I was willing to accept a</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.920" end="00:56:46.770" style="s2">possible rejection or other consequences</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.070" end="00:56:48.660" style="s2">of just being me and I&#39;ve done this</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.770" end="00:56:52.920" style="s2">social experiment now for about a year</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.660" end="00:56:55.980" style="s2">and a half where I&#39;ve just pushed my my</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.920" end="00:56:58.080" style="s2">own boundaries of transparency and</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.980" end="00:57:00.600" style="s2">authenticity just to see what would</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.080" end="00:57:03.510" style="s2">happen if I am in fact disliked or</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.600" end="00:57:05.550" style="s2">rejected or abandoned or ostracized by</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.510" end="00:57:07.500" style="s2">the world at large or what we call the</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.550" end="00:57:10.080" style="s2">following or a fan base or listeners or</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.500" end="00:57:12.830" style="s2">whatever and it&#39;s been so Buzard I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.080" end="00:57:16.260" style="s2">been talking about this a lot the more</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.830" end="00:57:18.570" style="s2">goofy and real and just true I can be</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.260" end="00:57:20.910" style="s2">like treating social media and my</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.570" end="00:57:22.830" style="s2">outward facing persona and brand like</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.910" end="00:57:24.180" style="s2">I&#39;m in a 12-step meeting and just like</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.830" end="00:57:28.050" style="s2">hey this is the I&#39;m going through a</p>

<p begin="00:57:31.860" end="00:57:38.580" style="s2">but I&#39;m finding this spiritual explosion</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.330" end="00:57:40.680" style="s2">of growth and just allowing myself to</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.580" end="00:57:43.380" style="s2">finally be seen and to really accept</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.680" end="00:57:45.440" style="s2">myself and love myself and what&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.380" end="00:57:47.760" style="s2">weird about it and this is just this</p>

<p begin="01:02:55.300" end="01:02:59.080" style="s2">with people in other parts of the world</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.560" end="01:03:01.510" style="s2">and be able to have messages that are</p>

<p begin="01:03:04.900" end="01:03:08.859" style="s2">it because we need to justify that right</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.760" end="01:03:10.690" style="s2">this is where it becomes important to</p>

<p begin="01:03:18.730" end="01:03:23.290" style="s2">optimizing as individuals so that they</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.280" end="01:03:25.090" style="s2">have more capacity to actually do things</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.290" end="01:03:26.410" style="s2">that are meaningful because when people</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.090" end="01:03:28.470" style="s2">look at climate change and they look at</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.410" end="01:03:30.970" style="s2">species extinction and they look at</p>

<p begin="01:03:45.160" end="01:03:47.740" style="s2">might actually be effective because if</p>

<p begin="01:03:47.740" end="01:03:51.220" style="s2">right it&#39;s a self assess what needs to</p>

<p begin="01:03:54.190" end="01:03:59.140" style="s2">so individual optimization for that</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.890" end="01:04:00.910" style="s2">purpose is meaningful but it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:06:11.440" end="01:06:14.500" style="s2">to be coming down a lot of field if</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.910" end="01:06:16.240" style="s2">you&#39;ll have me because there&#39;s many</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.500" end="01:06:20.190" style="s2">conversations that need to the need to</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.240" end="01:06:23.470" style="s2">happen but I definitely want to get into</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.190" end="01:06:26.920" style="s2">you know neuro hacker collective what</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.470" end="01:06:28.329" style="s2">you guys are doing qualia just getting</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.920" end="01:06:30.550" style="s2">now that we sort of created a framework</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.329" end="01:06:32.380" style="s2">and a reason that someone would want to</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.550" end="01:06:34.030" style="s2">optimize themself as other than just</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.380" end="01:06:36.099" style="s2">like coal now I can get more stuff for</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.030" end="01:06:39.579" style="s2">myself and be happier for myself but to</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.099" end="01:06:41.470" style="s2">actually you know be a piece of biology</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.579" end="01:06:43.000" style="s2">and consciousness that can go out into</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.470" end="01:06:44.920" style="s2">the world and have some discernment in</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.000" end="01:06:48.069" style="s2">terms of what I want to put my energy</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.920" end="01:06:49.990" style="s2">into or not so how did neuro hacker</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.069" end="01:06:51.430" style="s2">collective come to be and what are you</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.990" end="01:06:55.750" style="s2">guys all about for those that are</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.430" end="01:06:56.890" style="s2">unfamiliar yeah so there&#39;s a few</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.750" end="01:06:58.510" style="s2">founders and they all had the</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.890" end="01:07:01.540" style="s2">interesting different stories that kind</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.510" end="01:07:03.220" style="s2">of came together all sure</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.540" end="01:07:05.020" style="s2">so I was running a think tank that was</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.220" end="01:07:06.400" style="s2">working on the types of issues were</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.020" end="01:07:07.869" style="s2">talking about social issues how do we</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.400" end="01:07:10.869" style="s2">actually have civilization</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.869" end="01:07:12.849" style="s2">self-organized well and so one of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.869" end="01:07:14.230" style="s2">things we noticed pretty easy to notice</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.849" end="01:07:15.520" style="s2">is that all the problems we want to</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.230" end="01:07:17.849" style="s2">solve or problems that are caused by</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.520" end="01:07:20.190" style="s2">human action whether we&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.849" end="01:07:22.510" style="s2">species extinction or climate change or</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.190" end="01:07:24.490" style="s2">female general mutilation or war like</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.510" end="01:07:27.369" style="s2">this or human behavior mod topics right</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.490" end="01:07:28.780" style="s2">so how do we support humans to behave in</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.369" end="01:07:29.950" style="s2">ways that are good for themselves and</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.780" end="01:07:31.599" style="s2">good for the whole simultaneously</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.950" end="01:07:33.430" style="s2">without directly or indirectly causing</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.599" end="01:07:34.810" style="s2">harm so then it&#39;s the question is what</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.430" end="01:07:36.160" style="s2">are all the things that influence in</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.810" end="01:07:38.710" style="s2">behavior obviously we talked about</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.160" end="01:07:40.240" style="s2">economics if a particular action is</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.710" end="01:07:42.160" style="s2">incentive it&#39;s pretty hard to prevent it</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.240" end="01:07:43.900" style="s2">right so how do we create an economic</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.160" end="01:07:45.700" style="s2">system where the whale is not worth more</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.900" end="01:07:47.080" style="s2">dead than it is live if we don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.700" end="01:07:49.359" style="s2">have any whales that&#39;s a waving topic</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.080" end="01:07:51.400" style="s2">right how do we create you know social</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.359" end="01:07:52.900" style="s2">systems and tech influences our behavior</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.400" end="01:07:54.700" style="s2">our environment influence our behavior</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.900" end="01:07:56.080" style="s2">our psychology our worldview our</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.700" end="01:07:58.869" style="s2">definition of what is fundamentally</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.080" end="01:08:00.880" style="s2">meaningful to does but our biology also</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.869" end="01:08:03.040" style="s2">influences our behavior and everybody</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.880" end="01:08:05.050" style="s2">who has ever had a pretty significant</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.040" end="01:08:07.810" style="s2">sickness or even just had their hormones</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.050" end="01:08:10.660" style="s2">out of balance or a hangover knows that</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.810" end="01:08:12.460" style="s2">your physiology can go into a state that</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.660" end="01:08:14.560" style="s2">affects your psychology and your</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.460" end="01:08:16.450" style="s2">cognitive capacity and disposition</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.560" end="01:08:17.620" style="s2">significantly where if your</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.450" end="01:08:19.660" style="s2">neurotransmitters are off or your</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.620" end="01:08:23.259" style="s2">hormones are off ur etc in a particular</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.660" end="01:08:26.219" style="s2">way accessing gratitude or happiness or</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.259" end="01:08:29.410" style="s2">hope it might be very very hard and</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.219" end="01:08:31.000" style="s2">staying out of anger frustration etc</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.410" end="01:08:32.620" style="s2">might be very hard and that&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.000" end="01:08:33.880" style="s2">affect behavioral not only their own</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.620" end="01:08:36.730" style="s2">suffering but also behavioral</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.880" end="01:08:38.170" style="s2">predispositions same with complex</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.730" end="01:08:40.120" style="s2">thinking I&#39;ve actually got to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.170" end="01:08:42.040" style="s2">have a decent working memory to be able</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.120" end="01:08:43.960" style="s2">to hold multiple perspectives at once</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.040" end="01:08:45.969" style="s2">and synthesize them if I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.960" end="01:08:47.410" style="s2">enough working memory to hold multiple</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.969" end="01:08:49.509" style="s2">perspectives at the same time I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.410" end="01:08:51.460" style="s2">default into a simplistic perspective so</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.509" end="01:08:53.700" style="s2">right which is why I&#39;m malnourished</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.460" end="01:08:58.440" style="s2">people are so easy to brainwash right</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.700" end="01:09:00.460" style="s2">that is a part of it yeah and and so the</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.440" end="01:09:02.790" style="s2">you know the thing we started looking at</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.460" end="01:09:05.770" style="s2">there is how does physiology affect</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.790" end="01:09:07.900" style="s2">human predisposition not just their own</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.770" end="01:09:11.410" style="s2">experience but how likely they are to</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.900" end="01:09:13.900" style="s2">behave violently or behave charitably</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.410" end="01:09:15.310" style="s2">psychopathy empathy you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.900" end="01:09:16.989" style="s2">types of dynamics and also the ability</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.310" end="01:09:19.120" style="s2">to understand complex things the</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.989" end="01:09:20.290" style="s2">emotional resilience to hang in with</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.120" end="01:09:22.000" style="s2">them in difficult times and</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.290" end="01:09:24.640" style="s2">understanding more about mind brain</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.000" end="01:09:26.770" style="s2">interface there&#39;s a bi-directional</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.640" end="01:09:28.239" style="s2">interface both influenced each other as</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.770" end="01:09:30.790" style="s2">we&#39;re looking at the way the brain and</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.239" end="01:09:33.940" style="s2">the physiology affect the mind right the</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.790" end="01:09:36.370" style="s2">emotion and the cognitive dimensions we</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.940" end="01:09:38.409" style="s2">it&#39;s not just a genetic like oh you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:09:49.420" end="01:09:53.259" style="s2">look at psychiatric issues from genes</p>

<p begin="01:11:35.570" end="01:11:39.350" style="s2">was I want to get into the quality thing</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.310" end="01:11:44.960" style="s2">because people I get a lot of inquiries</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.350" end="01:11:46.699" style="s2">about it and I&#39;m I&#39;m so into it but well</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.960" end="01:11:48.679" style="s2">we&#39;ll go into that side a little as a</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.699" end="01:11:51.980" style="s2">framework but I definitely want to cover</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.679" end="01:11:56.659" style="s2">the X it&#39;s exciting so in a world where</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.980" end="01:11:58.400" style="s2">we have so much distraction from all of</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.659" end="01:12:01.699" style="s2">the things going off from social media</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.400" end="01:12:03.139" style="s2">on the phone and etc with so much hyper</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.699" end="01:12:06.020" style="s2">competitive pressure to try and produce</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.139" end="01:12:07.610" style="s2">almost everyone has a pretty strong</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.020" end="01:12:10.040" style="s2">sense of pressure to want to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.610" end="01:12:12.110" style="s2">focus better and to be able to have more</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.040" end="01:12:13.909" style="s2">sustained attention and get done</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.110" end="01:12:15.770" style="s2">while having a pretty significant</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.909" end="01:12:17.960" style="s2">challenge doing that and not only the</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.770" end="01:12:20.449" style="s2">you know focus issues like from</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.960" end="01:12:22.610" style="s2">distraction but insufficient nutrients</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.449" end="01:12:24.080" style="s2">that are necessary certain kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.610" end="01:12:27.530" style="s2">toxic exposure that effects the brain</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.080" end="01:12:29.780" style="s2">you know etc so so we see this ramp in</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.530" end="01:12:34.250" style="s2">energy drinks so more and more caffeine</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.780" end="01:12:36.050" style="s2">and in smart drug usage and and so with</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.250" end="01:12:38.659" style="s2">smart drugs in particular which in</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.050" end="01:12:39.800" style="s2">Contra distinction to brain nutrients</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.659" end="01:12:41.119" style="s2">for things you would just get from a</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.800" end="01:12:42.500" style="s2">normal healthy diet but we probably</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.119" end="01:12:44.119" style="s2">don&#39;t get enough because if depleted</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.500" end="01:12:45.739" style="s2">topsoil and whatever else right and</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.119" end="01:12:47.119" style="s2">those are just nutrients it in our</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.739" end="01:12:49.400" style="s2">evolutionary environment were necessary</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.119" end="01:12:52.340" style="s2">for brain function no we also didn&#39;t try</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.400" end="01:12:53.810" style="s2">to do 12 hours of productive work it was</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.340" end="01:12:55.070" style="s2">cognitive per day him and evolution</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.810" end="01:12:56.239" style="s2">environment so we&#39;re using nutrients</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.070" end="01:12:57.949" style="s2">differently so we might have an</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.239" end="01:13:00.290" style="s2">increased nutrient need we&#39;ve obviously</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.949" end="01:13:02.659" style="s2">got radically decreased time soil</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.290" end="01:13:04.489" style="s2">density interesting right so going on</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.659" end="01:13:06.440" style="s2">and collecting acorns for a couple hours</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.489" end="01:13:08.030" style="s2">that they are hunting for rabbits or</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.440" end="01:13:09.590" style="s2">whatever it&#39;s quite different from</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.030" end="01:13:11.679" style="s2">sitting down and solving the complex</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.590" end="01:13:15.230" style="s2">problems that we are in this</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.679" end="01:13:17.300" style="s2">technological age so whoo interesting</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.230" end="01:13:19.909" style="s2">you know deficiencies pretty rampant</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.300" end="01:13:21.860" style="s2">different kinds of toxicity like you</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.909" end="01:13:25.790" style="s2">know just the volatile organic compounds</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.860" end="01:13:28.280" style="s2">in this paint and this carpet are you</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.790" end="01:13:29.989" style="s2">know there&#39;s hundreds of VOCs in the air</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.280" end="01:13:31.760" style="s2">that were breathing just normal stuff</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.989" end="01:13:33.710" style="s2">right little own industrial pollution in</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.760" end="01:13:34.869" style="s2">the atmosphere and in and glyphosate in</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.710" end="01:13:37.400" style="s2">agriculture and whatever else and</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.869" end="01:13:39.290" style="s2">they&#39;re almost all either carcinogens or</p>

<p begin="01:13:43.550" end="01:13:46.760" style="s2">builders we&#39;ve built a world that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.720" end="01:13:48.380" style="s2">not adapted for and so how do we deal</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.760" end="01:13:49.640" style="s2">with that we were looking at the</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.380" end="01:13:51.620" style="s2">cognitive issues one of the first ones</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.640" end="01:13:53.360" style="s2">there many we looked at you know issues</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.620" end="01:13:54.980" style="s2">related to anxiety and depression and</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.360" end="01:13:58.010" style="s2">pain and addiction and sleep and those</p>

<p begin="01:13:58.010" end="01:14:01.550" style="s2">know we saw this meteoric rise of energy</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.870" end="01:14:04.400" style="s2">drinks so they&#39;re doing 15 billion</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.550" end="01:14:06.650" style="s2">dollars domestically pretty of you know</p>

<p begin="01:14:43.760" end="01:14:48.680" style="s2">with smart drugs obviously we have a lot</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.190" end="01:14:51.610" style="s2">of people on prescription adderall well</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.680" end="01:14:53.750" style="s2">be a trend by vans modafinil for</p>

<p begin="01:15:20.420" end="01:15:25.040" style="s2">also in off-label smart drug sales</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.120" end="01:15:28.490" style="s2">something like 5 billion in that role</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.040" end="01:15:31.280" style="s2">and they work right like they work for a</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.490" end="01:15:33.140" style="s2">very narrow set of metrics so if I want</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.280" end="01:15:35.260" style="s2">to focus get my midterm done or my tech</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.140" end="01:15:38.210" style="s2">startup or whatever it is the</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.260" end="01:15:40.460" style="s2">dopaminergic dynamics from the adderall</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.210" end="01:15:44.000" style="s2">are gonna make me focus better and have</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.460" end="01:15:45.080" style="s2">more motivation and more Drive now some</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.000" end="01:15:47.510" style="s2">of the interesting things that we find</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.080" end="01:15:49.160" style="s2">is because it&#39;s just modifying dopamine</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.510" end="01:15:51.230" style="s2">and not looking at acetylcholine and</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.160" end="01:15:52.130" style="s2">what how its involved in memory not</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.230" end="01:15:54.199" style="s2">looking at good</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.130" end="01:15:56.900" style="s2">main looking at all the rest of neuro</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.199" end="01:15:58.699" style="s2">chemistry and not even looking at all of</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.900" end="01:16:00.230" style="s2">the dopamine process just typically one</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.699" end="01:16:02.750" style="s2">small part that one&#39;s synthetic</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.230" end="01:16:03.980" style="s2">molecules overhead you get certain</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.750" end="01:16:07.130" style="s2">effects on certain side effects and</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.980" end="01:16:08.690" style="s2">certain missing effects right so we get</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.130" end="01:16:09.739" style="s2">increased focus but we don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.690" end="01:16:11.510" style="s2">increased memory we actually get</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.739" end="01:16:14.150" style="s2">decreased memory of certain kinds that</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.510" end="01:16:18.040" style="s2">are all decreased creativity and then</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.150" end="01:16:19.639" style="s2">decreased empathy increased anxiety</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.040" end="01:16:21.560" style="s2">aggressiveness sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.639" end="01:16:24.590" style="s2">depersonalization D realization</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.560" end="01:16:26.920" style="s2">decreased task switching you know etc</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.590" end="01:16:29.600" style="s2">these are really important things so and</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.920" end="01:16:30.230" style="s2">because even insofar as we&#39;re affecting</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.600" end="01:16:32.420" style="s2">dopamine</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.230" end="01:16:34.010" style="s2">we&#39;re just overriding a regulatory</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.420" end="01:16:35.989" style="s2">system providing a whole bunch of an</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.010" end="01:16:37.670" style="s2">insane chemical not actually saying how</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.989" end="01:16:39.260" style="s2">does this system regulate its own</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.670" end="01:16:40.790" style="s2">dopamine and how can we support it to do</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.260" end="01:16:42.710" style="s2">that then we&#39;re gonna create dependence</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.790" end="01:16:45.110" style="s2">and addiction and so these were the</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.710" end="01:16:47.300" style="s2">things that I saw was a scaling amount</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.110" end="01:16:49.040" style="s2">of dependence and addiction and very</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.300" end="01:16:50.750" style="s2">narrow positives with a lot of the</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.040" end="01:16:53.270" style="s2">positives that were necessary missing</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.750" end="01:16:55.250" style="s2">and meaningful side-effects so the</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.270" end="01:16:57.020" style="s2">question in that space we worked with</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.250" end="01:16:59.719" style="s2">people in a in an integrative medical</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.020" end="01:17:01.280" style="s2">clinical environment to when we had</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.719" end="01:17:03.590" style="s2">their genomics we had their blood labs</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.280" end="01:17:04.699" style="s2">we had brain scans to customize</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.590" end="01:17:06.530" style="s2">chemistry that helped them tremendously</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.699" end="01:17:08.600" style="s2">so we knew we could do that and then</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.530" end="01:17:10.130" style="s2">question was can we do that at scale</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.600" end="01:17:11.300" style="s2">without personalization which I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.130" end="01:17:12.920" style="s2">know because personalization is a big</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.300" end="01:17:15.110" style="s2">deal and we&#39;re working towards methods</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.920" end="01:17:17.870" style="s2">to build a personalized there are some</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.110" end="01:17:19.190" style="s2">things that I just won&#39;t do widely cuz</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.870" end="01:17:20.690" style="s2">they have to be personalized they&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.190" end="01:17:22.639" style="s2">different person-to-person so right</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.690" end="01:17:24.860" style="s2">right we don&#39;t have any type of folate</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.639" end="01:17:26.120" style="s2">or folic acid because whether someone</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.860" end="01:17:27.469" style="s2">should be on a methylated or a non</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.120" end="01:17:29.030" style="s2">methylate well it makes such a really</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.469" end="01:17:30.440" style="s2">big difference there we just don&#39;t talk</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.030" end="01:17:32.780" style="s2">with that access if we can&#39;t personalize</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.440" end="01:17:35.000" style="s2">that yeah but there are a lot of axes</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.780" end="01:17:36.590" style="s2">that everyone who is self selecting into</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.000" end="01:17:37.969" style="s2">a particular kind of thing like</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.590" end="01:17:39.889" style="s2">something for cognitive enhancement do</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.969" end="01:17:42.670" style="s2">pretty well across the whole board so</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.889" end="01:17:45.440" style="s2">you know high success and well tolerated</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.670" end="01:17:47.060" style="s2">so what we wanted to do with quality was</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.440" end="01:17:48.469" style="s2">say can we make an alternative so that</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.060" end="01:17:50.120" style="s2">people don&#39;t have to go to just</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.469" end="01:17:53.600" style="s2">tremendous amounts of caffeine or</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.120" end="01:17:55.550" style="s2">off-label smart drugs or just suffer</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.600" end="01:17:56.659" style="s2">without the ability to focus they will</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.550" end="01:17:57.230" style="s2">actually help them in what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.659" end="01:17:59.540" style="s2">looking for</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.230" end="01:18:02.030" style="s2">with enough subjective effect that they</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.540" end="01:18:04.520" style="s2">actually feel it and that will actually</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.030" end="01:18:06.100" style="s2">have a much wider host of positive</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.520" end="01:18:09.380" style="s2">effects that we&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.100" end="01:18:10.880" style="s2">focus and concentration and drive but</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.380" end="01:18:12.650" style="s2">also emotional resilience and</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.880" end="01:18:14.840" style="s2">task-switching and creativity and</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.650" end="01:18:17.210" style="s2">analysis and synthesis and you know so</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.840" end="01:18:18.710" style="s2">we started by doing a a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.210" end="01:18:20.870" style="s2">cognitive map of what are all of the</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.710" end="01:18:21.860" style="s2">states and all of the capacities that</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.870" end="01:18:23.570" style="s2">people are looking for when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.860" end="01:18:25.900" style="s2">really wanting to do productive work and</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.570" end="01:18:28.280" style="s2">then saying what are the underlying</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.900" end="01:18:29.620" style="s2">physiologic pathways that mediate those</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.280" end="01:18:32.270" style="s2">that we know about from the various</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.620" end="01:18:36.560" style="s2">neuro scientific and bio science fields</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.270" end="01:18:38.120" style="s2">and then can we understand how those</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.560" end="01:18:39.680" style="s2">systems work so how does the body</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.120" end="01:18:41.000" style="s2">regulate dopamine so you know as you</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.680" end="01:18:42.920" style="s2">start to look at it you say alright so</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.000" end="01:18:44.660" style="s2">protein comes in dietarily gets broken</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.920" end="01:18:47.090" style="s2">down to amino acids phenylalanine</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.660" end="01:18:48.770" style="s2">converts into tyrosine converts to M</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.090" end="01:18:51.110" style="s2">acetyl tyrosine converts to l dopa</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.770" end="01:18:52.870" style="s2">crosses the blood-brain barrier converts</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.110" end="01:18:55.340" style="s2">to dopamine in a presynaptic neuron</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.870" end="01:18:58.190" style="s2">transport a protein down an axon crosses</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.340" end="01:18:59.420" style="s2">the synapse has to get by synaptic</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.190" end="01:19:01.430" style="s2">enzymes that will break it down in</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.420" end="01:19:04.160" style="s2">different ways hydroxyl a&#39;s and mao b</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.430" end="01:19:05.600" style="s2">and comt and etc and then goes into one</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.160" end="01:19:07.610" style="s2">of a few dopamine receptors</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.600" end="01:19:08.990" style="s2">there&#39;s inner cellular dynamics that are</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.610" end="01:19:10.550" style="s2">involved so you just start to look at</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.990" end="01:19:13.370" style="s2">that and say how does the body do this</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.550" end="01:19:15.230" style="s2">thing on its own and are there</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.370" end="01:19:17.720" style="s2">deficiencies in any of those key</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.230" end="01:19:20.330" style="s2">nutrients or transform factors or things</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.720" end="01:19:22.970" style="s2">that are oftentimes under fully</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.330" end="01:19:24.620" style="s2">supported that we can support and that</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.970" end="01:19:26.150" style="s2">would be just looking at dopamine right</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.620" end="01:19:28.120" style="s2">then you do that with acetylcholine then</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.150" end="01:19:30.950" style="s2">you look at glutamate then you look at</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.120" end="01:19:32.510" style="s2">functions like neurogenesis but is</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.950" end="01:19:33.710" style="s2">continuously developing new neurons are</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.510" end="01:19:35.390" style="s2">there things that actually support</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.710" end="01:19:37.970" style="s2">increased neurogenesis or neuro at</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.390" end="01:19:41.030" style="s2">Offutt G killing old neurons better so</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.970" end="01:19:42.200" style="s2">you don&#39;t have senescence so we looked</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.030" end="01:19:44.990" style="s2">at what are the host of things people</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.200" end="01:19:46.760" style="s2">are looking for there are healthy states</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.990" end="01:19:48.470" style="s2">and capacities what is the underlying</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.760" end="01:19:50.480" style="s2">physiology involved how does that</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.470" end="01:19:52.160" style="s2">physiology naturally regulate and what</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.480" end="01:19:54.470" style="s2">what what might we be able to do to</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.160" end="01:19:57.040" style="s2">support the natural regulatory systems</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.470" end="01:19:59.540" style="s2">so that people both have a more complete</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.040" end="01:20:01.430" style="s2">positive State and that rather than</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.540" end="01:20:03.470" style="s2">create dependence right there on it for</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.430" end="01:20:05.840" style="s2">a while we overrode their regulatory</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.470" end="01:20:07.700" style="s2">system and now there&#39;s addiction that it</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.840" end="01:20:09.200" style="s2">actually is supporting the robustness of</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.700" end="01:20:11.270" style="s2">the regulatory system so that when they</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.200" end="01:20:13.040" style="s2">get off it there is elevation from</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.270" end="01:20:15.560" style="s2">baseline that lasts right the exact</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.040" end="01:20:17.480" style="s2">opposite side effect in the exact</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.560" end="01:20:18.729" style="s2">opposite of dependence so that was our</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.480" end="01:20:21.340" style="s2">goal and</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.729" end="01:20:23.469" style="s2">so we did hundreds of iterations a bunch</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.340" end="01:20:25.690" style="s2">of testing you know after doing full</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.469" end="01:20:27.099" style="s2">litter to review database of 500 no</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.690" end="01:20:28.420" style="s2">tropic chemicals and looking at the</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.099" end="01:20:29.979" style="s2">pathways of them and then looking at</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.420" end="01:20:32.709" style="s2">positive synergies negative synergies</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.979" end="01:20:35.289" style="s2">delivery mechanisms and we ended up</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.709" end="01:20:37.269" style="s2">getting to this formula</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.289" end="01:20:39.489" style="s2">you know that&#39;s there right now which</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.269" end="01:20:41.440" style="s2">over a large enough number of people</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.489" end="01:20:43.059" style="s2">over a large enough amount of time</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.440" end="01:20:45.280" style="s2">tested well enough that we were actually</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.059" end="01:20:47.260" style="s2">really happy with it and so that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.280" end="01:20:49.329" style="s2">first product and that the goal there</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.260" end="01:20:52.329" style="s2">was to be able to support people having</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.329" end="01:20:53.949" style="s2">increased productive capacity rate</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.329" end="01:20:55.539" style="s2">increased cognitive clarity and the</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.949" end="01:20:59.829" style="s2">associated emotional states like</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.539" end="01:21:03.610" style="s2">resilience and and drive that was</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.829" end="01:21:05.380" style="s2">actually not bad for people and good for</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.610" end="01:21:06.999" style="s2">people now I can&#39;t claim that we know</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.380" end="01:21:08.739" style="s2">that because we haven&#39;t done long enough</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.999" end="01:21:11.139" style="s2">term trials with enough metrics with</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.739" end="01:21:13.209" style="s2">enough controls to claim all that but</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.139" end="01:21:14.709" style="s2">you know we&#39;ve done pre clinical trials</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.209" end="01:21:16.780" style="s2">with pre and post brain scans and</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.709" end="01:21:19.090" style="s2">biometrics and seen you know really</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.780" end="01:21:22.690" style="s2">meaningful statistical correlation and</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.090" end="01:21:23.789" style="s2">change and we&#39;ve had forty thousand</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.690" end="01:21:25.869" style="s2">people over three years</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.789" end="01:21:31.209" style="s2">we&#39;re collecting data from what their</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.869" end="01:21:32.650" style="s2">experiences and so we we&#39;re very happy</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.209" end="01:21:34.690" style="s2">about that and that&#39;s the first product</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.650" end="01:21:37.479" style="s2">and you know what what it kind of is is</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.690" end="01:21:39.459" style="s2">a complex approach because our brain is</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.479" end="01:21:41.079" style="s2">a complex system bodies a complex system</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.459" end="01:21:43.030" style="s2">so rather than here&#39;s one molecule to</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.079" end="01:21:44.590" style="s2">overwrite it it&#39;s how does it</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.030" end="01:21:46.690" style="s2">self-regulate and can we support it</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.590" end="01:21:49.510" style="s2">self-regulation across many related axes</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.690" end="01:21:50.739" style="s2">now if we were gonna approach anxiety we</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.510" end="01:21:53.619" style="s2">would do it the same way if we were</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.739" end="01:21:57.039" style="s2">gonna approach pain rather than you know</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.619" end="01:21:58.179" style="s2">just some end set or opiate we would do</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.039" end="01:22:00.550" style="s2">it the same way how does the body</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.179" end="01:22:01.959" style="s2">naturally produce its own opiates how</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.550" end="01:22:03.699" style="s2">does it naturally deal with inflammation</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.959" end="01:22:05.469" style="s2">how does it and can we support those</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.699" end="01:22:08.349" style="s2">dynamics if we were gonna work with</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.469" end="01:22:10.809" style="s2">sleep we go to the same way so those are</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.349" end="01:22:12.249" style="s2">the Americans that are gonna mean I feel</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.809" end="01:22:14.409" style="s2">like I can&#39;t wait to feel you guys are</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.249" end="01:22:16.239" style="s2">coming up with next so there&#39;s a couple</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.409" end="01:22:18.010" style="s2">of things in there that I really like is</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.239" end="01:22:20.559" style="s2">that you guys really were very</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.010" end="01:22:22.239" style="s2">thoughtful about the synergy between the</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.559" end="01:22:23.860" style="s2">different compounds I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.239" end="01:22:25.360" style="s2">lot of cowboys and Indians right now in</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.860" end="01:22:27.900" style="s2">the nootropics phases I&#39;m sure you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.360" end="01:22:30.039" style="s2">aware where you see the same kind of</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.900" end="01:22:31.540" style="s2">formulations on 10 different products</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.039" end="01:22:33.130" style="s2">and it&#39;s like one guy just</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.540" end="01:22:35.530" style="s2">what the next guys doing on the label oh</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.130" end="01:22:37.540" style="s2">yeah here that&#39;s good for short-term</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.530" end="01:22:38.920" style="s2">memory focus cognition whatever blah</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.540" end="01:22:41.740" style="s2">blah and they just kind of throw those</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.920" end="01:22:43.900" style="s2">stacks out there without necessarily for</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.740" end="01:22:45.220" style="s2">thought as to how those interact with</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.900" end="01:22:48.100" style="s2">one another right so you have one</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.220" end="01:22:49.810" style="s2">molecule and it does one thing and let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.100" end="01:22:51.730" style="s2">just even say that that that effect of</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.810" end="01:22:52.780" style="s2">that molecule is universal and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.730" end="01:22:54.370" style="s2">choosing ones that are kind of</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.780" end="01:22:56.440" style="s2">universally affecting people in the same</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.370" end="01:22:57.880" style="s2">way but then you combine that with other</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.440" end="01:22:58.780" style="s2">molecules another ones another one</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.880" end="01:23:00.570" style="s2">tonight you have something totally</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.780" end="01:23:03.490" style="s2">different you have a third party</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.570" end="01:23:05.980" style="s2">compound now right and so that can go</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.490" end="01:23:07.810" style="s2">well or not based on self</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.980" end="01:23:09.730" style="s2">experimentation there&#39;s been times where</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.810" end="01:23:11.440" style="s2">I&#39;ve taken too many different things at</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.730" end="01:23:13.270" style="s2">the same time and too much of them and</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.440" end="01:23:15.640" style="s2">I&#39;m having the opposite effect where I</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.270" end="01:23:17.590" style="s2">can&#39;t focus and I&#39;m actually feel like</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.640" end="01:23:19.570" style="s2">I&#39;m freaking nuts because I took too</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.590" end="01:23:21.760" style="s2">many smart drugs or whatever but I think</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.570" end="01:23:23.080" style="s2">what&#39;s cool about qualia is that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.760" end="01:23:25.540" style="s2">really looked at how things relate to</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.080" end="01:23:26.830" style="s2">one another that you&#39;re not putting</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.540" end="01:23:28.720" style="s2">anything in there that&#39;s gonna cause</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.830" end="01:23:30.610" style="s2">your body to down regulate its own</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.720" end="01:23:32.530" style="s2">production we&#39;re to the point where</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.610" end="01:23:34.750" style="s2">there&#39;s a dependency and oh my god now I</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.530" end="01:23:37.120" style="s2">can&#39;t make this neurotransmitter or</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.750" end="01:23:40.060" style="s2">whatever because I&#39;ve been done for me</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.120" end="01:23:42.280" style="s2">for so long and then also that the whole</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.060" end="01:23:43.930" style="s2">basis of it is coming from what I like</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.280" end="01:23:45.970" style="s2">about the company itself is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.930" end="01:23:49.090" style="s2">coming from this intention that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.970" end="01:23:51.190" style="s2">trying to create people with biology</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.090" end="01:23:52.810" style="s2">that runs better so there&#39;ll be better</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.190" end="01:23:54.400" style="s2">people I mean to me that makes total</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.810" end="01:23:56.680" style="s2">sense I had to flew a couple of months</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.400" end="01:23:59.200" style="s2">ago and I was in Colorado and I had to</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.680" end="01:24:02.590" style="s2">speak at two events and they were pretty</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.200" end="01:24:04.660" style="s2">substantial for me and I was so sick</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.590" end="01:24:07.350" style="s2">dude and I could not make myself be in a</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.660" end="01:24:10.000" style="s2">good mood like I literally just couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.350" end="01:24:11.890" style="s2">be happy you know just I was just</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.000" end="01:24:13.540" style="s2">depressed and even though my mind was</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.890" end="01:24:15.610" style="s2">right and I wasn&#39;t fighting it I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.540" end="01:24:17.560" style="s2">like caught in some sort of negative</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.610" end="01:24:19.030" style="s2">spiral that wasn&#39;t actually negative at</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.560" end="01:24:21.220" style="s2">all I just wasn&#39;t in a good mood I</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.030" end="01:24:23.020" style="s2">didn&#39;t feel happy like I do right now so</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.220" end="01:24:26.500" style="s2">I wasn&#39;t firing on all cylinders you</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.020" end="01:24:29.020" style="s2">know so I really think that you do have</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.500" end="01:24:30.570" style="s2">to approach your own development from</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.020" end="01:24:33.910" style="s2">all sides in other words I can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.570" end="01:24:37.180" style="s2">eating you know glyphosate and aspartame</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.910" end="01:24:39.430" style="s2">and all this evil things that they put</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.180" end="01:24:40.900" style="s2">in food and just think I can meditate my</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.430" end="01:24:43.300" style="s2">way into a higher consciousness while</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.900" end="01:24:45.010" style="s2">I&#39;m destroying my biology in the same</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.300" end="01:24:45.320" style="s2">way I can&#39;t become obsessed with herbs</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.010" end="01:24:47.480" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.320" end="01:24:48.860" style="s2">super foods and nootropics and then be</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.480" end="01:24:51.770" style="s2">running around flipping people off in</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.860" end="01:24:53.150" style="s2">traffic caught in my trauma issues you</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.770" end="01:24:54.650" style="s2">know it&#39;s like you have to kind of</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.150" end="01:24:55.970" style="s2">approach it from all angles so I like</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.650" end="01:24:57.440" style="s2">that you&#39;re not like hey you guys let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.970" end="01:24:59.090" style="s2">make a cool vitamin that makes people</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.440" end="01:25:02.420" style="s2">better at computer work it&#39;s like now we</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.090" end="01:25:05.660" style="s2">have a larger scope of vision which is</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.420" end="01:25:08.660" style="s2">really cool now back to the qualia it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.660" end="01:25:11.360" style="s2">been interesting to observe the friends</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.660" end="01:25:12.740" style="s2">that I&#39;ve turned on to it and you know</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.360" end="01:25:15.140" style="s2">listeners of the show and stuff like</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.740" end="01:25:17.990" style="s2">that is that I haven&#39;t I&#39;ve yet to have</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.140" end="01:25:20.510" style="s2">anyone say that they had a negative</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.990" end="01:25:22.850" style="s2">experience as a result where with a lot</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.510" end="01:25:24.620" style="s2">of other nootropics people say that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.850" end="01:25:26.240" style="s2">too stimulating or it made them tired</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.620" end="01:25:28.910" style="s2">made them like this made them like that</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.240" end="01:25:30.470" style="s2">so I&#39;ve had no one report back like oh</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.910" end="01:25:33.200" style="s2">my god I felt horrible</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.470" end="01:25:35.540" style="s2">and only a couple people that were like</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.200" end="01:25:38.480" style="s2">man I don&#39;t really notice anything yeah</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.540" end="01:25:40.490" style="s2">so the majority of people that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.480" end="01:25:42.680" style="s2">interacted with it of tried are like oh</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.490" end="01:25:44.270" style="s2">my god this is the best thing ever like</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.680" end="01:25:45.910" style="s2">what where has this been my whole life</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.270" end="01:25:48.140" style="s2">like an overwhelmingly positive</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.910" end="01:25:49.970" style="s2">experience and that&#39;s what it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.140" end="01:25:51.410" style="s2">like for me too which is one of the</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.970" end="01:25:52.580" style="s2">reasons I wanted to track you down and I</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.410" end="01:25:54.080" style="s2">found that there was so much more to</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.580" end="01:25:57.830" style="s2">your story than just being like you know</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.080" end="01:25:59.450" style="s2">a guy that knows about nootropics but</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.830" end="01:26:01.130" style="s2">for me what&#39;s been interesting</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.450" end="01:26:03.290" style="s2">speaking of especially the the</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.130" end="01:26:06.260" style="s2">down-regulation piece is that when I</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.290" end="01:26:08.120" style="s2">started I took the full dose I think it</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.260" end="01:26:10.220" style="s2">was three of number one and six of</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.120" end="01:26:11.510" style="s2">number two and I did that a lot and it</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.220" end="01:26:13.220" style="s2">kind of just brought me up to a nice</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.510" end="01:26:15.680" style="s2">base level and then at a certain point</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.220" end="01:26:19.520" style="s2">that became a little too stimulating and</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.680" end="01:26:21.710" style="s2">now I&#39;m like I take one number one to</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.520" end="01:26:23.660" style="s2">number two and I&#39;m like I feel great</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.710" end="01:26:26.660" style="s2">there&#39;s no need to even push it beyond</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.660" end="01:26:28.970" style="s2">that so it actually has the opposite</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.660" end="01:26:32.420" style="s2">effect of building up a tolerance say</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.970" end="01:26:34.190" style="s2">right that was intended yeah so good job</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.420" end="01:26:36.080" style="s2">on that because with most other things</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.190" end="01:26:37.430" style="s2">you take it and you take it and you</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.080" end="01:26:38.600" style="s2">build up a tolerance you need more and</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.430" end="01:26:40.460" style="s2">more and then your body forgets how to</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.600" end="01:26:42.020" style="s2">make it and you end up in this imbalance</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.460" end="01:26:43.550" style="s2">but I think that there&#39;s just something</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.020" end="01:26:44.660" style="s2">really cool about what you&#39;ve done I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.550" end="01:26:48.080" style="s2">gonna come back to the problems of</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.660" end="01:26:49.220" style="s2">capitalism for a minute yeah every MBA</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.080" end="01:26:50.630" style="s2">student learns one of the first</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.220" end="01:26:53.810" style="s2">principles of businesses maximize</p>

<p begin="01:27:00.560" end="01:27:03.830" style="s2">getting too many shipments I had to stop</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.449" end="01:27:05.690" style="s2">that and just order when I run out</p>

<p begin="01:27:08.390" end="01:27:12.980" style="s2">against that degree so going so you</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.100" end="01:27:18.500" style="s2">think about it from Sam a pharma company</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.980" end="01:27:20.719" style="s2">and their MBAs that are looking at the</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.500" end="01:27:22.910" style="s2">financial instruments and making</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.719" end="01:27:24.770" style="s2">decisions right I mean at the financial</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.910" end="01:27:26.570" style="s2">metrics and spreadsheets and and saying</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.770" end="01:27:28.730" style="s2">okay maximize lifetime revenue of a</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.570" end="01:27:30.860" style="s2">customer the things that treat symptoms</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.730" end="01:27:32.750" style="s2">forever so we say depression is not</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.860" end="01:27:34.400" style="s2">curable you have a biochemical imbalance</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.750" end="01:27:35.870" style="s2">which is like some magic term</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.400" end="01:27:38.719" style="s2">biochemical models what the cause</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.870" end="01:27:40.670" style="s2">of it right genetic it&#39;s just just a</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.719" end="01:27:42.230" style="s2">magic term for we don&#39;t know where we</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.670" end="01:27:44.449" style="s2">haven&#39;t bothered to look at it and in</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.230" end="01:27:45.860" style="s2">depth and so we have to symptomatically</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.449" end="01:27:47.120" style="s2">treat that forever heart disease always</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.860" end="01:27:48.620" style="s2">symptomatically treat that forever</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.120" end="01:27:51.890" style="s2">cholesterol we&#39;re gonna treat it</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.620" end="01:27:53.780" style="s2">all of them right so that&#39;s very good</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.890" end="01:27:57.830" style="s2">from a lifetime revenue point of view</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.780" end="01:28:00.350" style="s2">and if it creates side effects that need</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.830" end="01:28:01.820" style="s2">other drugs to resolve them that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.350" end="01:28:05.929" style="s2">called a cross seller and uh perfect</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.820" end="01:28:07.100" style="s2">okay and then if to maximize lifetime</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.929" end="01:28:08.870" style="s2">value I want to start them as young as</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.100" end="01:28:12.790" style="s2">possible so we make up new diseases like</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.870" end="01:28:16.070" style="s2">a VD after we put to the ritalin shitty</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.790" end="01:28:17.660" style="s2">desks and do this don&#39;t make those desks</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.070" end="01:28:20.060" style="s2">like they have yeah seventies yeah those</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.660" end="01:28:21.679" style="s2">little wooden prisons okay so we get</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.060" end="01:28:24.770" style="s2">them started as early as possible on an</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.679" end="01:28:27.500" style="s2">iatrogenic cycle right so pretty much</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.770" end="01:28:28.850" style="s2">everything that happens in medicine we</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.500" end="01:28:30.440" style="s2">wanted to do the opposite if it causes</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.850" end="01:28:32.090" style="s2">addiction we want to create a long-term</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.440" end="01:28:32.870" style="s2">benefit it because the side effects</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.090" end="01:28:34.250" style="s2">won&#39;t the side effects to be</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.870" end="01:28:35.480" style="s2">comprehensively positive if the people</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.250" end="01:28:37.370" style="s2">have to stay on it we want them to be</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.480" end="01:28:40.550" style="s2">able get off of it right that like</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.370" end="01:28:42.260" style="s2">that&#39;s the goal and so really theory of</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.550" end="01:28:44.540" style="s2">market should not apply to medicine</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.260" end="01:28:46.190" style="s2">because people really can&#39;t choose to</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.540" end="01:28:47.810" style="s2">not participate with something that will</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.190" end="01:28:50.179" style="s2">make them better if they&#39;re sick and</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.810" end="01:28:51.440" style="s2">since they really can&#39;t choose not to do</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.179" end="01:28:52.370" style="s2">that theory of markets as a up</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.440" end="01:28:54.860" style="s2">thing just like there shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.370" end="01:28:56.090" style="s2">for-profit prisons right and so this was</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.860" end="01:28:57.440" style="s2">hard for us because in his why we</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.090" end="01:28:58.610" style="s2">started with supplement as opposed to</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.440" end="01:29:00.050" style="s2">bigger things we could have done is</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.610" end="01:29:04.010" style="s2">because I didn&#39;t want to take capital</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.050" end="01:29:06.050" style="s2">from any financial service places that</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.010" end="01:29:08.330" style="s2">would then bind us to doing things or</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.050" end="01:29:10.170" style="s2">unethical so like our right our cost of</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.330" end="01:29:12.960" style="s2">goods to make qualia is marked</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.170" end="01:29:14.730" style="s2">than most men tropics retail and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.960" end="01:29:16.620" style="s2">because if you want to use the right</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.730" end="01:29:17.880" style="s2">form right you use the phosphorylated</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.620" end="01:29:19.469" style="s2">version of this and the methylated</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.880" end="01:29:20.699" style="s2">version of this and etc and with the</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.469" end="01:29:22.050" style="s2">right concentration of the dose you</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.699" end="01:29:24.030" style="s2">knows you take nine capsules</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.050" end="01:29:25.560" style="s2">yeah but and that&#39;s not filler it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.030" end="01:29:28.080" style="s2">because it just takes that much of those</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.560" end="01:29:29.370" style="s2">things it&#39;s just expensive no and also</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.080" end="01:29:31.170" style="s2">the fact that you guys aren&#39;t using</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.370" end="01:29:32.670" style="s2">excipient sand binders and all that</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.170" end="01:29:34.410" style="s2">weird stuff which I always notice right</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.670" end="01:29:36.090" style="s2">away I&#39;m like I read go to that end of</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.410" end="01:29:37.920" style="s2">the label and a suddenly I got that</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.090" end="01:29:39.420" style="s2">there it is which means that you can&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:29:47.699" end="01:29:52.020" style="s2">thing is just a hard thing to make work</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.410" end="01:29:53.699" style="s2">fiscally but like you have found with</p>

<p begin="01:31:41.810" end="01:31:45.290" style="s2">connecting synapses or something that</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.580" end="01:31:46.910" style="s2">were off and now they&#39;re they&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.290" end="01:31:48.680" style="s2">more in alignment the way I look at it</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.910" end="01:31:51.410" style="s2">but there&#39;s other things to that</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.680" end="01:31:54.050" style="s2">depending on where I&#39;m going what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.410" end="01:31:55.250" style="s2">doing I find to be useful so today for</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.050" end="01:31:56.780" style="s2">example I knew that I was gonna have a</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.250" end="01:31:58.310" style="s2">very social day I&#39;m going to be talking</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.780" end="01:32:00.530" style="s2">to you I&#39;m being interviewed on the way</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.310" end="01:32:02.440" style="s2">back home after this so I did a number</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.530" end="01:32:05.480" style="s2">of different things one of them being</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.440" end="01:32:07.400" style="s2">phenibut for example which I&#39;ll maybe do</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.480" end="01:32:09.370" style="s2">once a week or something like that and I</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.400" end="01:32:13.219" style="s2">just find it&#39;s just a really great</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.370" end="01:32:16.370" style="s2">social lubricant and and also took some</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.219" end="01:32:19.100" style="s2">for asset amp because I find that it</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.370" end="01:32:21.680" style="s2">really helps me with speech some of</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.100" end="01:32:24.650" style="s2">these other things I&#39;ll do but I could</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.680" end="01:32:27.290" style="s2">give Joe here piracetam and it&#39;ll give</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.650" end="01:32:29.060" style="s2">him anxiety yeah or he won&#39;t notice</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.290" end="01:32:32.000" style="s2">anything alright give someone else I</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.060" end="01:32:33.350" style="s2">gave a girlfriend once phenibut and she</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.000" end="01:32:36.140" style="s2">probably took a little bit too much but</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.350" end="01:32:37.910" style="s2">she got deathly ill you know and on what</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.140" end="01:32:40.010" style="s2">I would take for this it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.910" end="01:32:41.660" style="s2">sprinkle to me to her she was a bit</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.010" end="01:32:44.360" style="s2">smaller and just had this huge adverse</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.660" end="01:32:46.550" style="s2">reaction same thing I&#39;m a daffodils</p>

<p begin="01:32:50.750" end="01:32:55.430" style="s2">for me is an eighth of one tablet so</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.570" end="01:32:57.260" style="s2">it&#39;s like a 200 milligram tablet once I</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.430" end="01:32:59.150" style="s2">took a half I was like oh my god I feel</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.260" end="01:33:02.630" style="s2">like I&#39;m on crystal meth not fun a</p>

<p begin="01:33:04.520" end="01:33:08.719" style="s2">productive day and be relatively alert</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.440" end="01:33:10.940" style="s2">just a tiny tiny little piece which is</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.719" end="01:33:12.980" style="s2">about an eighth of a tablet does me I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.940" end="01:33:15.140" style="s2">given it to friends I take man be</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.980" end="01:33:17.780" style="s2">careful this is a this is a drug this is</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.140" end="01:33:19.190" style="s2">not an herb let go easy they take a half</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.780" end="01:33:20.780" style="s2">so like I didn&#39;t feel anything they take</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.190" end="01:33:22.670" style="s2">another half they&#39;re like me I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.780" end="01:33:23.840" style="s2">notice anything like oh my god if I took</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.670" end="01:33:26.719" style="s2">a whole modafinil</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.840" end="01:33:28.160" style="s2">I would be like you know scrubbing the</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.719" end="01:33:30.140" style="s2">freaking bathroom floor with the</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.160" end="01:33:33.200" style="s2">toothbrush I mean I would be tweaking so</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.140" end="01:33:34.940" style="s2">hard so what&#39;s up with some of those</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.200" end="01:33:36.500" style="s2">lair you mentioned Deborah no I was on</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.940" end="01:33:37.750" style="s2">like low-dose Debra no for a while I</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.500" end="01:33:40.940" style="s2">have tried a lot of different things</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.750" end="01:33:42.710" style="s2">outside of the safe and more plant-based</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.940" end="01:33:44.270" style="s2">stuff that you guys work with in qualia</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.710" end="01:33:46.910" style="s2">what are some of the other ones are even</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.270" end="01:33:48.620" style="s2">micro dosing on psilocybin like that</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.910" end="01:33:50.000" style="s2">whole other world of smart drugs and</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.620" end="01:33:50.480" style="s2">nootropics what you got to say about any</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.000" end="01:33:54.170" style="s2">of that</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.480" end="01:33:56.380" style="s2">sure let&#39;s make some categories here so</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.170" end="01:33:56.380" style="s2">we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.500" end="01:34:01.190" style="s2">smart drugs as a category which are</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.940" end="01:34:03.469" style="s2">pharmaceuticals that are usually being</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.190" end="01:34:08.380" style="s2">used for an off-label purpose they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.469" end="01:34:12.410" style="s2">oftentimes psych meds like wellbutrin or</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.380" end="01:34:16.160" style="s2">adderall or they are narcolepsy meds</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.410" end="01:34:18.860" style="s2">like modafinil or they are sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.160" end="01:34:22.430" style="s2">anti Parkinson&#39;s meds</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.860" end="01:34:23.840" style="s2">Deborah Nell you know right every when I</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.430" end="01:34:25.400" style="s2">was taking that stuff because I was like</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.840" end="01:34:26.750" style="s2">what is that it&#39;s no big deal it&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.400" end="01:34:29.420" style="s2">Parkinson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.750" end="01:34:31.040" style="s2">how does micro dosing it now all of</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.420" end="01:34:32.330" style="s2">those are dopamine are dicks right so</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.040" end="01:34:34.160" style="s2">for different purposes they dopaminergic</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.330" end="01:34:35.960" style="s2">s-- you&#39;ll have some like for</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.160" end="01:34:37.460" style="s2">Alzheimer&#39;s don&#39;t have to say all that</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.960" end="01:34:39.500" style="s2">work with this is that all those urges</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.460" end="01:34:42.890" style="s2">mean they raise dopamine okay</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.500" end="01:34:45.020" style="s2">no wonder I like all of those yes so</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.890" end="01:34:48.980" style="s2">you&#39;ve got you know various types of</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.020" end="01:34:50.660" style="s2">smart drugs is one category most of the</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.980" end="01:34:53.239" style="s2">time those are gonna have a pretty</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.660" end="01:34:55.960" style="s2">strong effect and a pretty decent chance</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.239" end="01:34:58.670" style="s2">of side-effect if used improperly</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.960" end="01:35:01.850" style="s2">there&#39;s really nothing that is gonna be</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.670" end="01:35:03.350" style="s2">all that dangerous if used properly but</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.850" end="01:35:04.810" style="s2">properly is the big thing right like</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.350" end="01:35:08.180" style="s2">whether we&#39;re talking I mean you can use</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.810" end="01:35:10.160" style="s2">heroin not dangerously if you if you use</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.180" end="01:35:13.370" style="s2">it properly but that&#39;s like not how</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.160" end="01:35:15.920" style="s2">people use use heroin and specifically</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.370" end="01:35:17.750" style="s2">adderall is and feta mean right it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.920" end="01:35:19.390" style="s2">DM feta mean you add a methyl group to</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.750" end="01:35:20.750" style="s2">it you have methamphetamine</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.390" end="01:35:23.540" style="s2">methamphetamine used to be a</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.750" end="01:35:25.699" style="s2">pharmaceutical and so like the</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.540" end="01:35:28.400" style="s2">distinction between pharmaceuticals and</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.699" end="01:35:30.140" style="s2">illegal drugs is where the legal</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.400" end="01:35:32.900" style="s2">categorization of the minute happens to</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.140" end="01:35:35.300" style="s2">be based on lobbying not based on much</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.900" end="01:35:37.760" style="s2">else so you&#39;ve got smart drugs as a</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.300" end="01:35:39.969" style="s2">category and in general people should</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.760" end="01:35:42.110" style="s2">explore there if they are well educated</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.969" end="01:35:44.120" style="s2">if they&#39;re like if they really educate</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.110" end="01:35:46.370" style="s2">themselves well about the topic and they</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.120" end="01:35:48.409" style="s2">and they&#39;re really paying attention in a</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.370" end="01:35:50.059" style="s2">quantified self kind of way to the</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.409" end="01:35:51.559" style="s2">and they should not be looking at doing</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.059" end="01:35:52.280" style="s2">that super regularly now there are</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.559" end="01:35:54.559" style="s2">exceptions</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.280" end="01:35:58.249" style="s2">so Deborah Nell for instance works</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.559" end="01:36:01.610" style="s2">through mao-b inhibition so mao-b</p>
<p begin="01:35:58.249" end="01:36:03.079" style="s2">is a enzyme in this synapse that breaks</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.610" end="01:36:05.539" style="s2">down certain neurotransmitters like</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.079" end="01:36:09.679" style="s2">dopamine like other catecholamines like</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.539" end="01:36:12.079" style="s2">phenethylamines so if you inhibit the</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.679" end="01:36:13.760" style="s2">mao-b those neurotransmitters will bit</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.079" end="01:36:16.699" style="s2">across the synapse more into the</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.760" end="01:36:19.669" style="s2">postsynaptic neuron this can be very</p>
<p begin="01:36:16.699" end="01:36:22.909" style="s2">dangerous because if you take that with</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.669" end="01:36:24.919" style="s2">anything that is also increasing mono</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.909" end="01:36:26.599" style="s2">aunt means going those types of</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.919" end="01:36:27.829" style="s2">neurotransmitters going into the sand up</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.599" end="01:36:29.510" style="s2">specifically ones it should be broken</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.829" end="01:36:31.699" style="s2">down by mao-b they can get to to higher</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.510" end="01:36:34.010" style="s2">level so one wants to be careful with</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.699" end="01:36:35.989" style="s2">that and what would be some things that</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.010" end="01:36:37.099" style="s2">you with Deborah know for example that</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.989" end="01:36:38.269" style="s2">you wouldn&#39;t want to combine with that</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.099" end="01:36:40.489" style="s2">at all</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.269" end="01:36:41.599" style="s2">interesting and that doesn&#39;t mean nobody</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.489" end="01:36:43.789" style="s2">does it and has a good experience</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.599" end="01:36:46.219" style="s2">everyone the daffodil now they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.789" end="01:36:48.260" style="s2">different modafinil we don&#39;t know all</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.219" end="01:36:51.050" style="s2">the mechanisms of modafinil that well it</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.260" end="01:36:54.169" style="s2">is the least symptomatic dopaminergic</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.050" end="01:36:56.059" style="s2">for the most part for most people it</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.169" end="01:36:58.219" style="s2">seems like it works through transporter</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.059" end="01:37:00.169" style="s2">proteins largely which is gonna be a</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.219" end="01:37:04.939" style="s2">little bit less tricky than many of the</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.169" end="01:37:06.829" style="s2">other mechanisms but if if you are</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.939" end="01:37:08.539" style="s2">flooding the synapse with dopamine and</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.829" end="01:37:11.840" style="s2">not breaking it down you can get to</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.539" end="01:37:15.019" style="s2">dangerously high levels right and not</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.840" end="01:37:17.360" style="s2">everyone has to high mao be genetically</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.019" end="01:37:19.729" style="s2">some people&#39;s mao be is too low they</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.360" end="01:37:21.610" style="s2">actually feel anxious because they have</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.729" end="01:37:25.459" style="s2">too many of those excitatory</p>
<p begin="01:37:21.610" end="01:37:27.709" style="s2">neurotransmitters and never know what</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.459" end="01:37:30.169" style="s2">makes them feel terrible but there are a</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.709" end="01:37:32.809" style="s2">lot of people who are genetically /</p>
<p begin="01:37:30.169" end="01:37:35.269" style="s2">producers of mao-b and they will have</p>
<p begin="01:37:32.809" end="01:37:36.769" style="s2">certain kinds of depression tendencies</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.269" end="01:37:38.289" style="s2">because their transmitters are just not</p>

<p begin="01:43:09.410" end="01:43:13.520" style="s2">actually became approved as a drug</p>
<p begin="01:43:11.390" end="01:43:15.830" style="s2">without that being a concern in many</p>
<p begin="01:43:13.520" end="01:43:17.660" style="s2">different countries and then central</p>
<p begin="01:43:15.830" end="01:43:20.150" style="s2">Phenix seen never had any birth defects</p>
<p begin="01:43:17.660" end="01:43:21.650" style="s2">studies and so yet that&#39;s all over the</p>
<p begin="01:43:20.150" end="01:43:25.610" style="s2">web central don&#39;t do it because of</p>
<p begin="01:43:21.650" end="01:43:27.050" style="s2">birthday thank you no we pulled every</p>
<p begin="01:43:25.610" end="01:43:29.330" style="s2">single study ever done on central</p>
<p begin="01:43:27.050" end="01:43:30.380" style="s2">phenoxy inflicted 586 studies most of</p>
<p begin="01:43:29.330" end="01:43:32.870" style="s2">which weren&#39;t online we had to go to</p>
<p begin="01:43:30.380" end="01:43:34.730" style="s2">medical libraries find them in other</p>
<p begin="01:43:32.870" end="01:43:36.890" style="s2">countries and other languages right</p>
<p begin="01:43:34.730" end="01:43:38.180" style="s2">because they they were started the</p>
<p begin="01:43:36.890" end="01:43:40.340" style="s2">research better than the 50 so they just</p>
<p begin="01:43:38.180" end="01:43:43.460" style="s2">would never put online translate them</p>
<p begin="01:43:40.340" end="01:43:43.940" style="s2">all and then we had a few PhDs in neural</p>
<p begin="01:43:43.460" end="01:43:46.250" style="s2">chemistry</p>
<p begin="01:43:43.940" end="01:43:47.660" style="s2">neuroanatomy etc do a structured</p>
<p begin="01:43:46.250" end="01:43:49.190" style="s2">literate review meta-analysis of all</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.660" end="01:43:50.810" style="s2">that for us to come up with our opinion</p>
<p begin="01:43:49.190" end="01:43:53.720" style="s2">on central you know there&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:43:50.810" end="01:43:55.010" style="s2">trivial thing to do but it matters if</p>
<p begin="01:43:53.720" end="01:43:58.160" style="s2">you really don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on so</p>
<p begin="01:43:55.010" end="01:44:00.020" style="s2">i like the wild west of the space</p>
<p begin="01:43:58.160" end="01:44:02.630" style="s2">because people are starting to take more</p>
<p begin="01:44:00.020" end="01:44:04.010" style="s2">responsibility rather than just wait for</p>
<p begin="01:44:02.630" end="01:44:05.060" style="s2">the doctor tell them what to do and they</p>
<p begin="01:44:04.010" end="01:44:06.050" style="s2">get mad at the doctor when it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:44:05.060" end="01:44:07.520" style="s2">work yeah</p>
<p begin="01:44:06.050" end="01:44:08.780" style="s2">when the doctor couldn&#39;t possibly spend</p>
<p begin="01:44:07.520" end="01:44:11.600" style="s2">enough time with them or keep up-to-date</p>
<p begin="01:44:08.780" end="01:44:12.980" style="s2">with all the research happening but I</p>
<p begin="01:44:11.600" end="01:44:14.870" style="s2">really do long for higher quality</p>
<p begin="01:44:12.980" end="01:44:16.760" style="s2">control and it&#39;s one of the things we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:44:14.870" end="01:44:18.260" style="s2">working on and we can only work on it as</p>
<p begin="01:44:16.760" end="01:44:19.730" style="s2">fast as we can afford without moving</p>
<p begin="01:44:18.260" end="01:44:22.520" style="s2">into fiscal models that suck which is</p>
<p begin="01:44:19.730" end="01:44:23.510" style="s2">the tricky part but like neuro tech you</p>
<p begin="01:44:22.520" end="01:44:24.680" style="s2">know we were talking about different</p>
<p begin="01:44:23.510" end="01:44:27.740" style="s2">devices that we have around the house</p>
<p begin="01:44:24.680" end="01:44:29.420" style="s2">and pmf and etc it&#39;s pretty easy to say</p>
<p begin="01:44:27.740" end="01:44:31.340" style="s2">this seems compelling let&#39;s share it</p>
<p begin="01:44:29.420" end="01:44:33.110" style="s2">well what we&#39;re working to do right now</p>
<p begin="01:44:31.340" end="01:44:35.390" style="s2">is with all the types of neuro tech</p>
<p begin="01:44:33.110" end="01:44:37.130" style="s2">whether we&#39;re talking about low-level</p>
<p begin="01:44:35.390" end="01:44:39.050" style="s2">laser therapy and transcranial</p>
<p begin="01:44:37.130" end="01:44:41.920" style="s2">intranasal lasers or we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:44:39.050" end="01:44:43.820" style="s2">PMF or TMS or you know whatever right</p>
<p begin="01:44:41.920" end="01:44:45.680" style="s2">for us it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:44:43.820" end="01:44:47.630" style="s2">the process of doing the full letter to</p>
<p begin="01:44:45.680" end="01:44:49.670" style="s2">review on everything that&#39;s known about</p>
<p begin="01:44:47.630" end="01:44:50.810" style="s2">this where who what things does it</p>
<p begin="01:44:49.670" end="01:44:54.170" style="s2">affect what things does it not affect</p>
<p begin="01:44:50.810" end="01:44:57.320" style="s2">safe etc and then doing full research on</p>
<p begin="01:44:54.170" end="01:44:59.360" style="s2">the actual products and say does this</p>
<p begin="01:44:57.320" end="01:45:01.130" style="s2">product have the specifications that the</p>
<p begin="01:44:59.360" end="01:45:02.510" style="s2">literature shows are useful and then</p>
<p begin="01:45:01.130" end="01:45:04.100" style="s2">curate those things so we&#39;re building a</p>
<p begin="01:45:02.510" end="01:45:06.830" style="s2">platform to do that it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="01:45:04.100" end="01:45:09.770" style="s2">non-trivial process and the same with</p>
<p begin="01:45:06.830" end="01:45:11.300" style="s2">just curating knowledge on nootropics is</p>
<p begin="01:45:09.770" end="01:45:13.160" style="s2">in the forum you&#39;ve got like some real</p>
<p begin="01:45:11.300" end="01:45:14.540" style="s2">gems and then a bunch of and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:45:13.160" end="01:45:17.090" style="s2">not gonna say obvious which ones are the</p>
<p begin="01:45:14.540" end="01:45:18.800" style="s2">gems and the same like if you look</p>
<p begin="01:45:17.090" end="01:45:20.570" style="s2">in the bodybuilder world you go to the</p>
<p begin="01:45:18.800" end="01:45:22.310" style="s2">steroid forums some of the smartest</p>
<p begin="01:45:20.570" end="01:45:24.020" style="s2">endocrinologists anywhere are in there</p>
<p begin="01:45:22.310" end="01:45:26.180" style="s2">and then there&#39;s just so much dumb bro</p>
<p begin="01:45:24.020" end="01:45:27.440" style="s2">science in there okay that&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="01:45:26.180" end="01:45:28.489" style="s2">but if you don&#39;t know the field well</p>
<p begin="01:45:27.440" end="01:45:31.520" style="s2">they&#39;re all sand you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:45:28.489" end="01:45:33.350" style="s2">right so this is something that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:45:31.520" end="01:45:35.300" style="s2">really working to do is to have a</p>
<p begin="01:45:33.350" end="01:45:37.040" style="s2">moderation process where everything that</p>
<p begin="01:45:35.300" end="01:45:39.050" style="s2">goes there is better than that&#39;s cool</p>
<p begin="01:45:37.040" end="01:45:41.660" style="s2">man that&#39;s cool that&#39;s that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="01:45:39.050" end="01:45:43.160" style="s2">valuable resource because I that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:45:41.660" end="01:45:44.510" style="s2">excite you know another positive thing</p>
<p begin="01:45:43.160" end="01:45:46.580" style="s2">about right now is that I think more</p>
<p begin="01:45:44.510" end="01:45:49.580" style="s2">people are waking up to the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:45:46.580" end="01:45:52.370" style="s2">they don&#39;t actually have to rely on the</p>
<p begin="01:45:49.580" end="01:45:53.630" style="s2">allopathic medical system like I have</p>
<p begin="01:45:52.370" end="01:45:55.880" style="s2">episodes and I call them things like</p>
<p begin="01:45:53.630" end="01:45:58.310" style="s2">learning to become your own doctor you</p>
<p begin="01:45:55.880" end="01:46:00.230" style="s2">know it&#39;s like you really can do a lot</p>
<p begin="01:45:58.310" end="01:46:02.840" style="s2">on your own and then if you&#39;re if you</p>
<p begin="01:46:00.230" end="01:46:04.340" style="s2">are tied into someone good in functional</p>
<p begin="01:46:02.840" end="01:46:07.100" style="s2">medicine and they&#39;re able to kind of you</p>
<p begin="01:46:04.340" end="01:46:08.840" style="s2">know be a step above you in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:46:07.100" end="01:46:11.030" style="s2">their body and knowledge but like with</p>
<p begin="01:46:08.840" end="01:46:12.890" style="s2">my relationship to medicine is I do a</p>
<p begin="01:46:11.030" end="01:46:14.720" style="s2">lot of my own research and footwork and</p>
<p begin="01:46:12.890" end="01:46:16.460" style="s2">order my own labs and geek out and like</p>
<p begin="01:46:14.720" end="01:46:18.080" style="s2">which labs are the best and most updated</p>
<p begin="01:46:16.460" end="01:46:20.330" style="s2">because even my functional medicine</p>
<p begin="01:46:18.080" end="01:46:22.640" style="s2">doctor they&#39;re still in the labs that</p>
<p begin="01:46:20.330" end="01:46:24.260" style="s2">were the best GI test last year I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="01:46:22.640" end="01:46:26.680" style="s2">no man and the biohacking community</p>
<p begin="01:46:24.260" end="01:46:29.000" style="s2">there&#39;s new labs with you know new</p>
<p begin="01:46:26.680" end="01:46:31.220" style="s2">parameters and things like that and I</p>
<p begin="01:46:29.000" end="01:46:33.800" style="s2">really feel the sense of power and</p>
<p begin="01:46:31.220" end="01:46:35.480" style="s2">autonomy because I&#39;m you know I know my</p>
<p begin="01:46:33.800" end="01:46:36.980" style="s2">limitations in terms of my body of</p>
<p begin="01:46:35.480" end="01:46:38.900" style="s2">knowledge and what I made capable of</p>
<p begin="01:46:36.980" end="01:46:40.700" style="s2">kind of understanding or care to take</p>
<p begin="01:46:38.900" end="01:46:43.700" style="s2">the time to learn when it comes to my</p>
<p begin="01:46:40.700" end="01:46:45.320" style="s2">biology but I know what I know and then</p>
<p begin="01:46:43.700" end="01:46:46.970" style="s2">I go to the experts that are higher up</p>
<p begin="01:46:45.320" end="01:46:49.940" style="s2">the food chain and in their area of</p>
<p begin="01:46:46.970" end="01:46:52.040" style="s2">special specialization right so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:46:49.940" end="01:46:55.160" style="s2">really cool that that you guys are</p>
<p begin="01:46:52.040" end="01:46:56.390" style="s2">thinking that far ahead and enabling</p>
<p begin="01:46:55.160" end="01:46:58.040" style="s2">people to help</p>
<p begin="01:46:56.390" end="01:47:03.200" style="s2">themselves one of the parts I&#39;m most</p>
<p begin="01:46:58.040" end="01:47:05.510" style="s2">excited about is a integrative medical</p>
<p begin="01:47:03.200" end="01:47:07.430" style="s2">functional medical program so we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:47:05.510" end="01:47:09.170" style="s2">a number of doctors who are kind of the</p>
<p begin="01:47:07.430" end="01:47:12.320" style="s2">best integrative psychiatrists that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:47:09.170" end="01:47:14.180" style="s2">aware of and well psychiatrists or just</p>
<p begin="01:47:12.320" end="01:47:18.850" style="s2">functional medicine that does second or</p>
<p begin="01:47:14.180" end="01:47:20.810" style="s2">pharmacology and so you know we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:47:18.850" end="01:47:22.910" style="s2">allowed to provide medical information</p>
<p begin="01:47:20.810" end="01:47:26.270" style="s2">prescribe diagnose treat anything like</p>
<p begin="01:47:22.910" end="01:47:28.340" style="s2">that right so if people and if someone</p>
<p begin="01:47:26.270" end="01:47:29.630" style="s2">is on has psychic conditions or on</p>
<p begin="01:47:28.340" end="01:47:31.790" style="s2">psyche memories that don&#39;t use our stuff</p>
<p begin="01:47:29.630" end="01:47:33.800" style="s2">because as there&#39;s real interactions</p>
<p begin="01:47:31.790" end="01:47:34.970" style="s2">that need to be factored but we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:47:33.800" end="01:47:36.110" style="s2">want to just say go to your doctor if</p>
<p begin="01:47:34.970" end="01:47:38.030" style="s2">your doctor doesn&#39;t know anything we</p>
<p begin="01:47:36.110" end="01:47:39.740" style="s2">want to provide better resources so go</p>
<p begin="01:47:38.030" end="01:47:40.970" style="s2">to your doctor and the hero doctors that</p>
<p begin="01:47:39.740" end="01:47:42.950" style="s2">actually know the field really well they</p>
<p begin="01:47:40.970" end="01:47:45.740" style="s2">can run a qejy on you they can run</p>
<p begin="01:47:42.950" end="01:47:47.600" style="s2">neural hormones they can run your Walsh</p>
<p begin="01:47:45.740" end="01:47:48.770" style="s2">metabolic labs they can run your gut</p>
<p begin="01:47:47.600" end="01:47:50.720" style="s2">brain access they can look at your</p>
<p begin="01:47:48.770" end="01:47:54.590" style="s2">genomics etc and actually do the the</p>
<p begin="01:47:50.720" end="01:47:58.190" style="s2">best of what functional brain chemistry</p>
<p begin="01:47:54.590" end="01:47:59.720" style="s2">optimization currently looks like and so</p>
<p begin="01:47:58.190" end="01:48:01.130" style="s2">that&#39;s something that we&#39;ll be rolling</p>
<p begin="01:47:59.720" end="01:48:02.890" style="s2">out in this next year and we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:48:01.130" end="01:48:06.290" style="s2">already working with another that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:48:02.890" end="01:48:08.500" style="s2">amazing that&#39;s amazing yeah because you</p>

<p begin="01:48:10.700" end="01:48:14.840" style="s2">have the time and energy to devote to</p>
<p begin="01:48:12.530" end="01:48:16.730" style="s2">yourself but I think each one of us can</p>
<p begin="01:48:14.840" end="01:48:18.560" style="s2">only take it to a certain level and we</p>
<p begin="01:48:16.730" end="01:48:20.000" style="s2">need you know we need that help but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:48:18.560" end="01:48:21.890" style="s2">like how do you find a good one I always</p>
<p begin="01:48:20.000" end="01:48:23.720" style="s2">get the question of who&#39;s the best</p>
<p begin="01:48:21.890" end="01:48:25.970" style="s2">functional medicine doctor and I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:48:23.720" end="01:48:27.470" style="s2">I just made it easy on myself after</p>
<p begin="01:48:25.970" end="01:48:29.900" style="s2">working with a number of them</p>

<p begin="01:48:29.900" end="01:48:33.710" style="s2">house which is like a you know sort of I</p>
<p begin="01:48:32.030" end="01:48:36.230" style="s2">think if it&#39;s the uber of functional</p>
<p begin="01:48:33.710" end="01:48:38.060" style="s2">medicine just a modern interface and a</p>
<p begin="01:48:36.230" end="01:48:40.490" style="s2">membership model rather than paying per</p>
<p begin="01:48:38.060" end="01:48:41.990" style="s2">visit and and I find it to be really</p>
<p begin="01:48:40.490" end="01:48:43.310" style="s2">effective because they can deal with my</p>
<p begin="01:48:41.990" end="01:48:45.410" style="s2">insurance in the billing and they know</p>
<p begin="01:48:43.310" end="01:48:47.270" style="s2">how to code the labs and stuff but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:48:45.410" end="01:48:48.650" style="s2">still very much self-directed like I</p>
<p begin="01:48:47.270" end="01:48:50.780" style="s2">could just follow their program probably</p>
<p begin="01:48:48.650" end="01:48:53.810" style="s2">be healthy but I&#39;m always digging deeper</p>
<p begin="01:48:50.780" end="01:48:55.580" style="s2">so I&#39;ll do you know three different</p>
<p begin="01:48:53.810" end="01:48:57.530" style="s2">tests for metals where they might just</p>

<p begin="01:48:57.530" end="01:49:01.460" style="s2">urine test I&#39;m like oh that gives me a</p>
<p begin="01:48:59.360" end="01:49:03.110" style="s2">certain metric but just hair analysis</p>
<p begin="01:49:01.460" end="01:49:05.960" style="s2">there&#39;s blood there&#39;s other ways you can</p>
<p begin="01:49:03.110" end="01:49:08.150" style="s2">dive into that but it&#39;s helpful to have</p>
<p begin="01:49:05.960" end="01:49:09.480" style="s2">someone you trust that&#39;ll go along with</p>
<p begin="01:49:08.150" end="01:49:11.489" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing because</p>
<p begin="01:49:09.480" end="01:49:14.100" style="s2">in the Western medicine model I go into</p>
<p begin="01:49:11.489" end="01:49:15.870" style="s2">the general practitioner and be like hey</p>
<p begin="01:49:14.100" end="01:49:17.430" style="s2">I have XY and Z wrong they send me out</p>
<p begin="01:49:15.870" end="01:49:19.470" style="s2">to a number of specialists that are</p>
<p begin="01:49:17.430" end="01:49:20.850" style="s2">their cronies and it&#39;s like you get</p>
<p begin="01:49:19.470" end="01:49:22.350" style="s2">stuck in that whole thing and I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="01:49:20.850" end="01:49:24.060" style="s2">in there telling them about some new</p>
<p begin="01:49:22.350" end="01:49:26.220" style="s2">supplement or technology and the doctors</p>
<p begin="01:49:24.060" end="01:49:28.590" style="s2">like what I don&#39;t even know about dad</p>
<p begin="01:49:26.220" end="01:49:30.120" style="s2">you know like the Liao&#39;s having some</p>

<p begin="01:49:30.120" end="01:49:35.640" style="s2">and I you know went up the the ladder in</p>
<p begin="01:49:33.420" end="01:49:37.050" style="s2">LA medical system which i think is</p>
<p begin="01:49:35.640" end="01:49:38.520" style="s2">probably a pretty good place to live if</p>
<p begin="01:49:37.050" end="01:49:40.950" style="s2">you want some you know high-level</p>
<p begin="01:49:38.520" end="01:49:43.560" style="s2">medical care and I got sent to the you</p>
<p begin="01:49:40.950" end="01:49:45.570" style="s2">know the world&#39;s best EMT that people</p>
<p begin="01:49:43.560" end="01:49:46.739" style="s2">travel from all over the world I go sit</p>
<p begin="01:49:45.570" end="01:49:47.970" style="s2">down with this guy said yeah man I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:49:46.739" end="01:49:49.470" style="s2">know man I have you know I have a little</p>

<p begin="01:49:49.470" end="01:49:52.830" style="s2">I&#39;m well aware that but I had this thing</p>
<p begin="01:49:51.480" end="01:49:55.590" style="s2">where I&#39;m getting dizzy all the time and</p>
<p begin="01:49:52.830" end="01:49:57.210" style="s2">I always feel carsick and he ran some</p>
<p begin="01:49:55.590" end="01:49:59.070" style="s2">tests for me I came in again he goes</p>
<p begin="01:49:57.210" end="01:50:01.590" style="s2">yeah I think you probably should just</p>
<p begin="01:49:59.070" end="01:50:03.780" style="s2">not drink coffee I think it&#39;s the the</p>
<p begin="01:50:01.590" end="01:50:05.550" style="s2">caffeine can do that like really this is</p>
<p begin="01:50:03.780" end="01:50:08.100" style="s2">what you guys this the best you guys can</p>
<p begin="01:50:05.550" end="01:50:10.470" style="s2">do is that the caffeine isn&#39;t making me</p>
<p begin="01:50:08.100" end="01:50:12.510" style="s2">you know it was just like oh my god I</p>
<p begin="01:50:10.470" end="01:50:14.460" style="s2">could have done a much better job of</p>
<p begin="01:50:12.510" end="01:50:16.410" style="s2">being my own doctor and of course I you</p>
<p begin="01:50:14.460" end="01:50:18.690" style="s2">know finding finding the root of that</p>
<p begin="01:50:16.410" end="01:50:20.100" style="s2">but it&#39;s a cool time to be alive where</p>
<p begin="01:50:18.690" end="01:50:21.810" style="s2">those of us that are waking up and have</p>
<p begin="01:50:20.100" end="01:50:24.620" style="s2">access to information like you guys are</p>
<p begin="01:50:21.810" end="01:50:28.050" style="s2">providing can really take responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:50:24.620" end="01:50:30.630" style="s2">well and not become this dependent</p>
<p begin="01:50:28.050" end="01:50:34.470" style="s2">infant on the teeth of Western medicine</p>
<p begin="01:50:30.630" end="01:50:36.270" style="s2">and all the inherent expenses and things</p>
<p begin="01:50:34.470" end="01:50:37.590" style="s2">that come along with that and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:50:36.270" end="01:50:41.550" style="s2">really important to keep the Pareto</p>
<p begin="01:50:37.590" end="01:50:43.320" style="s2">principle in mind which is it does get</p>
<p begin="01:50:41.550" end="01:50:45.030" style="s2">complex quickly and to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:50:43.320" end="01:50:47.580" style="s2">synthesize the complexity is a really</p>
<p begin="01:50:45.030" end="01:50:49.980" style="s2">deep topic and the foundations are still</p>
<p begin="01:50:47.580" end="01:50:52.050" style="s2">80% of it and the foundations are not</p>
<p begin="01:50:49.980" end="01:50:53.790" style="s2">that hard right I mean they might be</p>
<p begin="01:50:52.050" end="01:50:55.230" style="s2">hard to do from a discipline point of</p>
<p begin="01:50:53.790" end="01:50:58.770" style="s2">view in the life that is conditioned</p>
<p begin="01:50:55.230" end="01:51:00.680" style="s2">otherwise but if someone is not sleeping</p>
<p begin="01:50:58.770" end="01:51:03.120" style="s2">enough sleeping well and sleeping enough</p>
<p begin="01:51:00.680" end="01:51:04.860" style="s2">everything else they&#39;ll do is just tiny</p>
<p begin="01:51:03.120" end="01:51:08.489" style="s2">diminishing returns in comparison to</p>
<p begin="01:51:04.860" end="01:51:10.770" style="s2">sleepy enough right right and if someone</p>
<p begin="01:51:08.489" end="01:51:12.870" style="s2">is not exercising and if they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:51:10.770" end="01:51:15.000" style="s2">generally eating well and if they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:51:12.870" end="01:51:19.680" style="s2">doing some kinds of stress management</p>
<p begin="01:51:15.000" end="01:51:21.930" style="s2">and mental processes then biohacking is</p>
<p begin="01:51:19.680" end="01:51:23.190" style="s2">actually a way to support living</p>
<p begin="01:51:21.930" end="01:51:24.989" style="s2">shittily right</p>
<p begin="01:51:23.190" end="01:51:27.270" style="s2">trying to like symptom manage the fact</p>
<p begin="01:51:24.989" end="01:51:30.510" style="s2">that their life actually sucks right and</p>
<p begin="01:51:27.270" end="01:51:32.730" style="s2">that&#39;s just not the way to go right and</p>
<p begin="01:51:30.510" end="01:51:34.680" style="s2">so if someone really just does the</p>
<p begin="01:51:32.730" end="01:51:37.500" style="s2">foundational stuff it&#39;s amazing how much</p>
<p begin="01:51:34.680" end="01:51:39.870" style="s2">of it that addresses and even like I say</p>
<p begin="01:51:37.500" end="01:51:42.060" style="s2">we look at heavy metals so I can do a</p>
<p begin="01:51:39.870" end="01:51:44.550" style="s2">pre and post provocation test and I can</p>
<p begin="01:51:42.060" end="01:51:45.719" style="s2">test with the MPs or DMS a or EDTA and</p>
<p begin="01:51:44.550" end="01:51:48.870" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna get different specific</p>
<p begin="01:51:45.719" end="01:51:51.060" style="s2">bindings and I can look at hair labs</p>
<p begin="01:51:48.870" end="01:51:53.580" style="s2">which will give me a different timescale</p>
<p begin="01:51:51.060" end="01:51:56.400" style="s2">of what&#39;s being excreted and I can look</p>
<p begin="01:51:53.580" end="01:51:59.040" style="s2">at you know metal antibodies tens ending</p>
<p begin="01:51:56.400" end="01:52:01.620" style="s2">and then what I&#39;m gonna find is okay</p>
<p begin="01:51:59.040" end="01:52:03.390" style="s2">there are specific chelation or binders</p>
<p begin="01:52:01.620" end="01:52:06.020" style="s2">that I&#39;m going to use differentially if</p>
<p begin="01:52:03.390" end="01:52:09.510" style="s2">it&#39;s lead versus mercury right or</p>
<p begin="01:52:06.020" end="01:52:11.640" style="s2">gadolinium or whatever it is that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:52:09.510" end="01:52:14.340" style="s2">lot to figure out it&#39;s a lot of expense</p>
<p begin="01:52:11.640" end="01:52:16.469" style="s2">and if I just put the person in a sauna</p>
<p begin="01:52:14.340" end="01:52:18.710" style="s2">every day and I gave them chlorella in</p>
<p begin="01:52:16.469" end="01:52:22.980" style="s2">the morning that would be 80% as good</p>
<p begin="01:52:18.710" end="01:52:25.739" style="s2">okay right yeah and so it&#39;s just kind of</p>
<p begin="01:52:22.980" end="01:52:27.360" style="s2">important like one of the things we want</p>
<p begin="01:52:25.739" end="01:52:29.100" style="s2">people to know is that there are</p>
<p begin="01:52:27.360" end="01:52:31.440" style="s2">foundational things that if they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:52:29.100" end="01:52:33.120" style="s2">have the time money proclivity will</p>
<p begin="01:52:31.440" end="01:52:35.340" style="s2">really help them be radically healthier</p>
<p begin="01:52:33.120" end="01:52:37.380" style="s2">and then optimization on top of that</p>
<p begin="01:52:35.340" end="01:52:38.820" style="s2">that&#39;s nice right yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:52:37.380" end="01:52:41.460" style="s2">well stated sometimes they&#39;ll find</p>
<p begin="01:52:38.820" end="01:52:43.260" style="s2">myself taking a 50 pills in the morning</p>
<p begin="01:52:41.460" end="01:52:45.480" style="s2">trying to turn my brain on and then I</p>
<p begin="01:52:43.260" end="01:52:48.630" style="s2">realized maybe if I hadn&#39;t gone to bed</p>
<p begin="01:52:45.480" end="01:52:51.660" style="s2">at 2:00 a.m. and woken up at 7:30 you</p>
<p begin="01:52:48.630" end="01:52:53.489" style="s2">know so that&#39;s that&#39;s very true some of</p>
<p begin="01:52:51.660" end="01:52:55.380" style="s2">those things are just basic lifestyle</p>
<p begin="01:52:53.489" end="01:52:58.020" style="s2">choices if you eat if you think about it</p>
<p begin="01:52:55.380" end="01:53:01.410" style="s2">if you&#39;re gonna eat food in its measured</p>
<p begin="01:52:58.020" end="01:53:02.910" style="s2">in pounds and it&#39;s all nutrients right</p>
<p begin="01:53:01.410" end="01:53:04.530" style="s2">that&#39;s all talks in our nutrient and</p>
<p begin="01:53:02.910" end="01:53:05.690" style="s2">then you&#39;re gonna take supplements that</p>
<p begin="01:53:04.530" end="01:53:08.100" style="s2">are measured in grams</p>
<p begin="01:53:05.690" end="01:53:09.360" style="s2">the supplement the word supplement means</p>
<p begin="01:53:08.100" end="01:53:11.280" style="s2">to supplement that what you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="01:53:09.360" end="01:53:13.140" style="s2">from diet right like getting the pounds</p>
<p begin="01:53:11.280" end="01:53:16.140" style="s2">right as a big deal right and</p>
<p begin="01:53:13.140" end="01:53:18.900" style="s2">similarly with sleep like when you</p>
<p begin="01:53:16.140" end="01:53:20.310" style="s2">exercise all that torn muscle that it</p>
<p begin="01:53:18.900" end="01:53:22.560" style="s2">needs to repair is gonna be repairing</p>
<p begin="01:53:20.310" end="01:53:24.150" style="s2">during sleep during delta ii particular</p>
<p begin="01:53:22.560" end="01:53:25.620" style="s2">all those nutrients that need to go into</p>
<p begin="01:53:24.150" end="01:53:28.290" style="s2">new tissues are gonna do that during</p>
<p begin="01:53:25.620" end="01:53:29.640" style="s2">sleep and so if you&#39;re not sleeping</p>
<p begin="01:53:28.290" end="01:53:32.130" style="s2">enough like all those stuff just kind of</p>
<p begin="01:53:29.640" end="01:53:33.540" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter that much and so this is</p>
<p begin="01:53:32.130" end="01:53:35.040" style="s2">one of the places where i want to</p>
<p begin="01:53:33.540" end="01:53:36.570" style="s2">empower people in the face of the</p>
<p begin="01:53:35.040" end="01:53:38.340" style="s2">complexity to</p>
<p begin="01:53:36.570" end="01:53:42.119" style="s2">you know that there is a simplicity that</p>
<p begin="01:53:38.340" end="01:53:44.070" style="s2">is most of it which is if you live a</p>
<p begin="01:53:42.119" end="01:53:46.349" style="s2">life that is relatively closer to an</p>
<p begin="01:53:44.070" end="01:53:48.230" style="s2">evolutionary environment evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:53:46.349" end="01:53:51.119" style="s2">life you&#39;ll just do a lot better and</p>
<p begin="01:53:48.230" end="01:53:52.739" style="s2">then all the other stuff if you&#39;re sick</p>
<p begin="01:53:51.119" end="01:53:54.840" style="s2">you definitely want to go find good</p>
<p begin="01:53:52.739" end="01:53:56.340" style="s2">functional practitioners and if you</p>
<p begin="01:53:54.840" end="01:53:57.360" style="s2">really want to optimize you want to go</p>
<p begin="01:53:56.340" end="01:53:59.849" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:53:57.360" end="01:54:02.070" style="s2">I&#39;ll said I love it man I&#39;ve got about</p>
<p begin="01:53:59.849" end="01:54:04.079" style="s2">in the interest of time we&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="01:54:02.070" end="01:54:06.690" style="s2">around the two-hour mark which is I try</p>
<p begin="01:54:04.079" end="01:54:09.150" style="s2">to cap any conversation off no matter</p>

<p begin="01:56:52.030" end="01:56:55.479" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="01:56:52.869" end="01:56:56.920" style="s2">lasers and light devices and magnetism</p>
<p begin="01:56:55.479" end="01:56:58.780" style="s2">and all this kind of stuff oh cool</p>

<p begin="01:57:28.260" end="01:57:33.159" style="s2">technologies that you&#39;re digging right</p>
<p begin="01:57:30.070" end="01:57:35.260" style="s2">now personally mm-hmm some of the ones</p>
<p begin="01:57:33.159" end="01:57:37.439" style="s2">that I appreciate a lot that are like</p>
<p begin="01:57:35.260" end="01:57:41.079" style="s2">consumer neuro tech they&#39;re not still in</p>
<p begin="01:57:37.439" end="01:57:46.659" style="s2">R&amp;D I&#39;m a big fan like everybody else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:57:41.079" end="01:57:48.219" style="s2">of red light and so companies like juve</p>
<p begin="01:57:46.659" end="01:57:49.570" style="s2">and buy light and other ones that</p>
<p begin="01:57:48.219" end="01:57:52.869" style="s2">they&#39;re working on intranasal</p>
<p begin="01:57:49.570" end="01:57:55.300" style="s2">transcranial whole-body near infrared</p>
<p begin="01:57:52.869" end="01:57:56.559" style="s2">and visible infrared and we wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:57:55.300" end="01:57:58.360" style="s2">need that if we just been a fan of Sun</p>
<p begin="01:57:56.559" end="01:58:00.969" style="s2">right but if you don&#39;t spend enough time</p>
<p begin="01:57:58.360" end="01:58:02.650" style="s2">in the Sun it is removed from normal</p>
<p begin="01:58:00.969" end="01:58:04.570" style="s2">indoor lighting because it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:58:02.650" end="01:58:06.190" style="s2">that makes it expensive yeah who uses</p>
<p begin="01:58:04.570" end="01:58:08.050" style="s2">that more energy to make warm light</p>
<p begin="01:58:06.190" end="01:58:09.700" style="s2">right so rather than do the whole house</p>
<p begin="01:58:08.050" end="01:58:12.160" style="s2">you just do your body with your clothes</p>
<p begin="01:58:09.700" end="01:58:14.260" style="s2">off and ran it we photosynthesize</p>
<p begin="01:58:12.160" end="01:58:15.850" style="s2">molecules like plants do not as many as</p>
<p begin="01:58:14.260" end="01:58:16.960" style="s2">plants plants or all surface area</p>
<p begin="01:58:15.850" end="01:58:18.520" style="s2">photosynthesis well not that much</p>
<p begin="01:58:16.960" end="01:58:20.860" style="s2">surface hair but we it&#39;s a meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:58:18.520" end="01:58:22.690" style="s2">part so we know that the Bloor and UV</p>
<p begin="01:58:20.860" end="01:58:24.850" style="s2">into the spectrum helps us with vitamin</p>
<p begin="01:58:22.690" end="01:58:26.320" style="s2">D and the way that it does vitamin D</p>
<p begin="01:58:24.850" end="01:58:28.330" style="s2">synthesis is different than all really</p>
<p begin="01:58:26.320" end="01:58:31.090" style="s2">supplementing vitamin D so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:58:28.330" end="01:58:34.300" style="s2">meaningfulness there but nitric oxide is</p>
<p begin="01:58:31.090" end="01:58:37.620" style="s2">also photo synthesized from exposure to</p>
<p begin="01:58:34.300" end="01:58:39.970" style="s2">light and ATP specifically is</p>
<p begin="01:58:37.620" end="01:58:41.410" style="s2">upregulated mitochondria output of ATP</p>
<p begin="01:58:39.970" end="01:58:44.380" style="s2">is upregulated from the red end of the</p>
<p begin="01:58:41.410" end="01:58:46.150" style="s2">spectrum and so up regulating ATP output</p>
<p begin="01:58:44.380" end="01:58:47.830" style="s2">is kind of just good for everything</p>
<p begin="01:58:46.150" end="01:58:49.420" style="s2">right this Gerrans increased cellular</p>
<p begin="01:58:47.830" end="01:58:51.610" style="s2">energy to do whatever the cells are</p>
<p begin="01:58:49.420" end="01:58:53.590" style="s2">doing so that&#39;s what I like and I do</p>
<p begin="01:58:51.610" end="01:58:56.050" style="s2">like transcranial and intranasal</p>
<p begin="01:58:53.590" end="01:58:59.140" style="s2">applications especially where there is</p>
<p begin="01:58:56.050" end="01:59:00.820" style="s2">TBI or tinnitus or things there where</p>
<p begin="01:58:59.140" end="01:59:03.550" style="s2">you don&#39;t quite know how to address it</p>
<p begin="01:59:00.820" end="01:59:06.520" style="s2">specifically but interesting because I</p>
<p begin="01:59:03.550" end="01:59:09.220" style="s2">do the nei the V light the eight ten</p>
<p begin="01:59:06.520" end="01:59:10.090" style="s2">nanometers near-infrared it&#39;s yet</p>
<p begin="01:59:09.220" end="01:59:11.470" style="s2">invisible right</p>
<p begin="01:59:10.090" end="01:59:13.720" style="s2">I used that when I used to have the one</p>
<p begin="01:59:11.470" end="01:59:15.160" style="s2">that was six something it was very red</p>
<p begin="01:59:13.720" end="01:59:17.170" style="s2">it lit up the whole front of her face</p>
<p begin="01:59:15.160" end="01:59:18.970" style="s2">which I just like that for a fact I</p>
<p begin="01:59:17.170" end="01:59:22.840" style="s2">don&#39;t know which one does what and then</p>
<p begin="01:59:18.970" end="01:59:24.010" style="s2">I do the jus and I love both of those as</p>
<p begin="01:59:22.840" end="01:59:26.350" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="01:59:24.010" end="01:59:28.480" style="s2">like seriously when but here&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="01:59:26.350" end="01:59:29.890" style="s2">I also get a lot of Sun my vitamin D</p>
<p begin="01:59:28.480" end="01:59:31.960" style="s2">levels are off the chart I still</p>
<p begin="01:59:29.890" end="01:59:33.430" style="s2">supplement with it here&#39;s one thing that</p>
<p begin="01:59:31.960" end="01:59:34.660" style="s2">I wanted to get your opinion and I</p>
<p begin="01:59:33.430" end="01:59:35.650" style="s2">always say okay it&#39;s the end of the</p>
<p begin="01:59:34.660" end="01:59:38.500" style="s2">interview and that it goes on for</p>
<p begin="01:59:35.650" end="01:59:40.360" style="s2">another hour but in all seriousness with</p>
<p begin="01:59:38.500" end="01:59:42.160" style="s2">the spectrum of light because I do</p>
<p begin="01:59:40.360" end="01:59:44.710" style="s2">sungazing have been doing that for years</p>
<p begin="01:59:42.160" end="01:59:47.440" style="s2">grounding all in the Sun gazing when the</p>
<p begin="01:59:44.710" end="01:59:50.110" style="s2">Sun rises or goes down I get full naked</p>
<p begin="01:59:47.440" end="01:59:51.880" style="s2">Sun as much as possible so I&#39;m getting a</p>
<p begin="01:59:50.110" end="01:59:53.770" style="s2">lot of the natural spectrums I limit</p>
<p begin="01:59:51.880" end="01:59:56.350" style="s2">blue light at night like pretty hardcore</p>
<p begin="01:59:53.770" end="01:59:58.750" style="s2">in the home when it gets dark outside it</p>
<p begin="01:59:56.350" end="02:00:00.520" style="s2">also gets amber and red inside like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:59:58.750" end="02:00:02.620" style="s2">dialing that in my sleeps great</p>

<p begin="02:00:46.150" end="02:00:50.469" style="s2">wherever the fuck&#39;s going on but the</p>
<p begin="02:00:48.730" end="02:00:52.480" style="s2">temperature of the light and the</p>
<p begin="02:00:50.469" end="02:00:54.999" style="s2">spectrum of light is being altered in an</p>
<p begin="02:00:52.480" end="02:00:56.619" style="s2">unnatural way from whatever&#39;s being done</p>
<p begin="02:00:54.999" end="02:00:59.019" style="s2">in our skies do you think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:00:56.619" end="02:01:00.849" style="s2">having you know an effect on our biology</p>
<p begin="02:00:59.019" end="02:01:02.800" style="s2">just aside from whatever toxins might we</p>

<p begin="02:01:02.800" end="02:01:12.210" style="s2">actual nature of light itself of course</p>
<p begin="02:01:07.769" end="02:01:16.150" style="s2">very short answer to a long question so</p>
<p begin="02:01:12.210" end="02:01:19.510" style="s2">geoengineering is an approach to us</p>
<p begin="02:01:16.150" end="02:01:21.099" style="s2">recognizing that we&#39;re very close to</p>
<p begin="02:01:19.510" end="02:01:22.659" style="s2">positive feedback loops on certain</p>
<p begin="02:01:21.099" end="02:01:25.150" style="s2">climate change dynamics and people freak</p>
<p begin="02:01:22.659" end="02:01:27.130" style="s2">out and rather freak out says well we</p>
<p begin="02:01:25.150" end="02:01:30.010" style="s2">need to actually get the temperature</p>
<p begin="02:01:27.130" end="02:01:31.599" style="s2">down because even before the acid is</p>
<p begin="02:01:30.010" end="02:01:33.369" style="s2">killing the coral from ocean</p>
<p begin="02:01:31.599" end="02:01:34.989" style="s2">acidification from co2 diffusing into</p>
<p begin="02:01:33.369" end="02:01:36.670" style="s2">the water as carbonic acid even before</p>
<p begin="02:01:34.989" end="02:01:38.289" style="s2">the trophic cascades are killing the</p>
<p begin="02:01:36.670" end="02:01:41.320" style="s2">coral from the large fish die-off</p>
<p begin="02:01:38.289" end="02:01:42.639" style="s2">from overfishing the temperature is the</p>
<p begin="02:01:41.320" end="02:01:44.980" style="s2">main thing driving them into bleaching</p>
<p begin="02:01:42.639" end="02:01:46.659" style="s2">and hypometabolism they can&#39;t stay in</p>
<p begin="02:01:44.980" end="02:01:48.579" style="s2">that place very long most of the</p>
<p begin="02:01:46.659" end="02:01:49.780" style="s2">photosynthesis of the world happens in</p>
<p begin="02:01:48.579" end="02:01:52.599" style="s2">the oceans and a lot of it depends on</p>
<p begin="02:01:49.780" end="02:01:54.579" style="s2">the coral and the positive feedback loop</p>
<p begin="02:01:52.599" end="02:01:55.480" style="s2">on the albedo cycle at the caps like so</p>
<p begin="02:01:54.579" end="02:01:57.909" style="s2">it&#39;s like whoa we need to get</p>
<p begin="02:01:55.480" end="02:02:00.670" style="s2">temperature down so the idea of let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:01:57.909" end="02:02:02.079" style="s2">just reflect 20% of sunlight by putting</p>
<p begin="02:02:00.670" end="02:02:05.019" style="s2">particles never atmosphere that will</p>
<p begin="02:02:02.079" end="02:02:08.050" style="s2">reflect 20% sunlight is the same exact</p>
<p begin="02:02:05.019" end="02:02:11.469" style="s2">approach as our cholesterol so I use a</p>
<p begin="02:02:08.050" end="02:02:13.539" style="s2">statin mm8 it is a it&#39;s addressing the</p>
<p begin="02:02:11.469" end="02:02:15.039" style="s2">symptom in a way that will then have</p>
<p begin="02:02:13.539" end="02:02:18.070" style="s2">effects that are negative for other</p>
<p begin="02:02:15.039" end="02:02:19.269" style="s2">parts of it because we&#39;re scared of the</p>
<p begin="02:02:18.070" end="02:02:20.679" style="s2">symptom without understanding what</p>
<p begin="02:02:19.269" end="02:02:23.380" style="s2">caused it and addressing it at a college</p>
<p begin="02:02:20.679" end="02:02:25.300" style="s2">level so of course what we should be</p>
<p begin="02:02:23.380" end="02:02:26.800" style="s2">focused on is how do we just increase</p>
<p begin="02:02:25.300" end="02:02:30.340" style="s2">photosynthesis for sequester</p>
<p begin="02:02:26.800" end="02:02:31.810" style="s2">and decrease emissions and what has to</p>
<p begin="02:02:30.340" end="02:02:34.030" style="s2">happen to be able to do that at what</p>
<p begin="02:02:31.810" end="02:02:35.710" style="s2">scale in time but yeah it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="02:02:34.030" end="02:02:38.260" style="s2">interesting allopathic medicine is</p>
<p begin="02:02:35.710" end="02:02:40.090" style="s2">looking at individual metrics that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:02:38.260" end="02:02:42.190" style="s2">correlated to something and how do we</p>
<p begin="02:02:40.090" end="02:02:44.920" style="s2">exogenously override that individual</p>
<p begin="02:02:42.190" end="02:02:47.200" style="s2">metric without looking at what brought</p>
<p begin="02:02:44.920" end="02:02:48.970" style="s2">it about to be that way so complex</p>
<p begin="02:02:47.200" end="02:02:50.530" style="s2">multifactorial dynamics we suck out</p>
<p begin="02:02:48.970" end="02:02:52.840" style="s2">which is why we don&#39;t have a single cure</p>
<p begin="02:02:50.530" end="02:02:54.550" style="s2">for any chronic illness we can cut</p>
<p begin="02:02:52.840" end="02:02:56.760" style="s2">cancers out radiate amount poison amount</p>
<p begin="02:02:54.550" end="02:02:58.810" style="s2">we can&#39;t make them stop growing and</p>
<p begin="02:02:56.760" end="02:03:00.400" style="s2">understand why they grow in terms of</p>
<p begin="02:02:58.810" end="02:03:01.330" style="s2">current medicine same with psychiatric</p>
<p begin="02:03:00.400" end="02:03:02.980" style="s2">illnesses</p>
<p begin="02:03:01.330" end="02:03:04.600" style="s2">same with neuro degenerative same with</p>
<p begin="02:03:02.980" end="02:03:06.550" style="s2">autoimmune because they don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="02:03:04.600" end="02:03:08.890" style="s2">single cause we&#39;re actually awesome at a</p>
<p begin="02:03:06.550" end="02:03:10.930" style="s2">to cause issues right right right</p>
<p begin="02:03:08.890" end="02:03:14.950" style="s2">if it&#39;s an acute injury or an acute</p>
<p begin="02:03:10.930" end="02:03:16.210" style="s2">infection or an acute toxicity that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:03:14.950" end="02:03:17.890" style="s2">really straightforward and we know how</p>
<p begin="02:03:16.210" end="02:03:19.870" style="s2">to treat that thing but if it is</p>
<p begin="02:03:17.890" end="02:03:21.130" style="s2">anything other than a cute single cause</p>
<p begin="02:03:19.870" end="02:03:22.510" style="s2">that we kind of suck at it right now</p>
<p begin="02:03:21.130" end="02:03:24.850" style="s2">because it requires a different approach</p>
<p begin="02:03:22.510" end="02:03:26.950" style="s2">to science of this complexity approach</p>
<p begin="02:03:24.850" end="02:03:29.860" style="s2">which also requires a different fiscal</p>
<p begin="02:03:26.950" end="02:03:31.720" style="s2">model and a different IP structure and a</p>
<p begin="02:03:29.860" end="02:03:33.670" style="s2">whole bunch of things we approach the</p>
<p begin="02:03:31.720" end="02:03:35.770" style="s2">world the same way our approach to</p>
<p begin="02:03:33.670" end="02:03:38.380" style="s2">climate change to starvation to whatever</p>
<p begin="02:03:35.770" end="02:03:39.730" style="s2">is to tweak something to affect that</p>
<p begin="02:03:38.380" end="02:03:41.020" style="s2">thing here without addressing the</p>
<p begin="02:03:39.730" end="02:03:43.300" style="s2">underlying dynamics it may be that</p>
<p begin="02:03:41.020" end="02:03:46.150" style="s2">almost always geoengineering is like</p>
<p begin="02:03:43.300" end="02:03:47.920" style="s2">allopathic medicine it is a statin to</p>
<p begin="02:03:46.150" end="02:03:51.160" style="s2">the environment yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s funny</p>
<p begin="02:03:47.920" end="02:03:52.720" style="s2">man and definitely it&#39;s affecting the</p>
<p begin="02:03:51.160" end="02:03:54.430" style="s2">light going back to like your you know</p>
<p begin="02:03:52.720" end="02:03:55.510" style="s2">your top devices a lot of the stuff</p>
<p begin="02:03:54.430" end="02:03:58.150" style="s2">that&#39;s coming out another thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:03:55.510" end="02:04:00.340" style="s2">really effective is ways to sort of use</p>
<p begin="02:03:58.150" end="02:04:01.840" style="s2">technology to mimic nature in a sense</p>
<p begin="02:04:00.340" end="02:04:03.880" style="s2">and that&#39;s how I think about an infrared</p>
<p begin="02:04:01.840" end="02:04:05.890" style="s2">sauna or cryotherapy I mean any of the</p>
<p begin="02:04:03.880" end="02:04:07.450" style="s2">things that I do is quote unquote bio</p>
<p begin="02:04:05.890" end="02:04:09.790" style="s2">hacks are grounding you know using</p>
<p begin="02:04:07.450" end="02:04:12.520" style="s2">earthing technology pmf all this stuff</p>
<p begin="02:04:09.790" end="02:04:18.340" style="s2">it&#39;s all really just trying to create</p>
<p begin="02:04:12.520" end="02:04:19.900" style="s2">that homeostatic experience of being the</p>
<p begin="02:04:18.340" end="02:04:21.820" style="s2">sentient being on planet earth in its</p>

<p begin="02:04:26.950" end="02:04:31.450" style="s2">gotten 100 years ago yeah true our main</p>
<p begin="02:04:29.500" end="02:04:32.680" style="s2">bio hacks are actually just putting us</p>
<p begin="02:04:31.450" end="02:04:33.820" style="s2">back in something closer to an</p>
<p begin="02:04:32.680" end="02:04:36.100" style="s2">evolutionary environment so our air</p>
<p begin="02:04:33.820" end="02:04:38.400" style="s2">filter right is not making special air</p>
<p begin="02:04:36.100" end="02:04:39.510" style="s2">it&#39;s just making less primary right</p>
<p begin="02:04:38.400" end="02:04:41.820" style="s2">I thought that you have one over there</p>
<p begin="02:04:39.510" end="02:04:44.310" style="s2">to have them in every room yeah and our</p>
<p begin="02:04:41.820" end="02:04:46.469" style="s2">water filters are also still not as good</p>
<p begin="02:04:44.310" end="02:04:48.960" style="s2">as spring water right do you have a</p>
<p begin="02:04:46.469" end="02:04:50.760" style="s2">pristine hydro filter they don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="02:04:48.960" end="02:04:53.909" style="s2">precise they&#39;re there in Laguna Beach</p>
<p begin="02:04:50.760" end="02:04:55.409" style="s2">you know not far from here but I&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="02:04:53.909" end="02:04:57.360" style="s2">a lot of research on the filters and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:04:55.409" end="02:04:59.159" style="s2">gonna interview that guy but I think if</p>
<p begin="02:04:57.360" end="02:05:01.739" style="s2">I had to have a filter he&#39;d probably be</p>
<p begin="02:04:59.159" end="02:05:04.440" style="s2">the guy he vortexes the water he puts</p>

<p begin="02:05:04.440" end="02:05:08.520" style="s2">I mean he&#39;s like it&#39;s like making spring</p>
<p begin="02:05:06.780" end="02:05:10.980" style="s2">water out of municipal water it&#39;s crazy</p>
<p begin="02:05:08.520" end="02:05:12.270" style="s2">but anyway but you know whether we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:05:10.980" end="02:05:14.429" style="s2">changing our weather we&#39;re pulling</p>

<p begin="02:05:15.870" end="02:05:19.020" style="s2">actually it&#39;s not releasing much because</p>
<p begin="02:05:17.489" end="02:05:22.080" style="s2">I used the AFM safe coat</p>
<p begin="02:05:19.020" end="02:05:23.310" style="s2">oh no and safe coats another biohack</p>
<p begin="02:05:22.080" end="02:05:25.739" style="s2">that i think is awesome if you have a</p>
<p begin="02:05:23.310" end="02:05:27.179" style="s2">place that&#39;s new carpet or new paint or</p>

<p begin="02:05:36.840" end="02:05:44.370" style="s2">so many people who are ill go like move</p>
<p begin="02:05:40.800" end="02:05:47.730" style="s2">to or visit some more rural natural</p>
<p begin="02:05:44.370" end="02:05:49.380" style="s2">place and they get better right and so</p>
<p begin="02:05:47.730" end="02:05:51.179" style="s2">that&#39;s a lot of it and then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:05:49.380" end="02:05:53.219" style="s2">course advanced shed that is not just</p>
<p begin="02:05:51.179" end="02:05:54.540" style="s2">doing that yeah what are the weather</p>
<p begin="02:05:53.219" end="02:05:56.610" style="s2">kind of tricks you got up your sleeve</p>
<p begin="02:05:54.540" end="02:06:00.690" style="s2">that I haven&#39;t been observed walking by</p>
<p begin="02:05:56.610" end="02:06:01.500" style="s2">tech wise well qejy based neurofeedback</p>
<p begin="02:06:00.690" end="02:06:04.230" style="s2">is awesome</p>
<p begin="02:06:01.500" end="02:06:06.060" style="s2">mmm and whether you&#39;re doing alpha theta</p>
<p begin="02:06:04.230" end="02:06:08.250" style="s2">training or SMR training or Delta</p>
<p begin="02:06:06.060" end="02:06:10.050" style="s2">training should be based off your qejy</p>
<p begin="02:06:08.250" end="02:06:11.640" style="s2">and someone knows how knows how to do</p>
<p begin="02:06:10.050" end="02:06:13.170" style="s2">that well I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve ever</p>
<p begin="02:06:11.640" end="02:06:15.000" style="s2">went to peak brain since she&#39;s living</p>
<p begin="02:06:13.170" end="02:06:16.739" style="s2">there all the time yeah but Enders good</p>
<p begin="02:06:15.000" end="02:06:19.350" style="s2">yeah andrew is good I interviewed him</p>
<p begin="02:06:16.739" end="02:06:22.140" style="s2">here yeah on the show and I was on his</p>
<p begin="02:06:19.350" end="02:06:24.060" style="s2">show - yeah brilliant guy so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:06:22.140" end="02:06:26.159" style="s2">great therapy right now</p>
<p begin="02:06:24.060" end="02:06:28.020" style="s2">I mean TMS is actually interesting it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:06:26.159" end="02:06:31.250" style="s2">it&#39;s early but it&#39;s interesting for many</p>
<p begin="02:06:28.020" end="02:06:34.710" style="s2">things or it&#39;s TMS transcranial magnetic</p>
<p begin="02:06:31.250" end="02:06:35.969" style="s2">stimulation is profoundly interesting in</p>
<p begin="02:06:34.710" end="02:06:38.070" style="s2">the early studies at University of</p>
<p begin="02:06:35.969" end="02:06:39.570" style="s2">Arizona and some Japanese universities</p>
<p begin="02:06:38.070" end="02:06:41.940" style="s2">in curing Alzheimer&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:06:39.570" end="02:06:44.550" style="s2">I&#39;m through a very novel proposed</p>
<p begin="02:06:41.940" end="02:06:46.320" style="s2">mechanism involving microtubules but</p>
<p begin="02:06:44.550" end="02:06:48.719" style="s2">it&#39;s too early to really know what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:06:46.320" end="02:06:50.310" style="s2">doing so there&#39;s a number of high-tech</p>
<p begin="02:06:48.719" end="02:06:52.289" style="s2">methods that are really cool and</p>
<p begin="02:06:50.310" end="02:06:54.000" style="s2">specifically there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="02:06:52.289" end="02:06:55.980" style="s2">some of the most high-tech ones are are</p>
<p begin="02:06:54.000" end="02:06:57.329" style="s2">actually still evolutionary Merriman</p>
<p begin="02:06:55.980" end="02:07:01.079" style="s2">ones like the cutting edge of microbiome</p>
<p begin="02:06:57.329" end="02:07:02.849" style="s2">X is mostly that the vaginal flora and</p>
<p begin="02:07:01.079" end="02:07:04.289" style="s2">the breast milk of indigenous people who</p>
<p begin="02:07:02.849" end="02:07:07.860" style="s2">were never exposed to chlorinated water</p>
<p begin="02:07:04.289" end="02:07:10.710" style="s2">and antibiotics and glyphosate have a</p>
<p begin="02:07:07.860" end="02:07:12.150" style="s2">whole bunch of bacteria that we just</p>
<p begin="02:07:10.710" end="02:07:13.320" style="s2">don&#39;t have in probiotics anywhere else</p>
<p begin="02:07:12.150" end="02:07:15.150" style="s2">that are actually part of our</p>
<p begin="02:07:13.320" end="02:07:16.920" style="s2">evolutionary environment that are the</p>
<p begin="02:07:15.150" end="02:07:19.559" style="s2">most significant factors for epigenetic</p>
<p begin="02:07:16.920" end="02:07:21.809" style="s2">modulation we&#39;re genome so that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="02:07:19.559" end="02:07:23.820" style="s2">cutting edge right understanding of</p>
<p begin="02:07:21.809" end="02:07:25.469" style="s2">epigenetics and microbiome mix right and</p>
<p begin="02:07:23.820" end="02:07:27.929" style="s2">it is also saying oh evolution actually</p>
<p begin="02:07:25.469" end="02:07:31.889" style="s2">kind of makes sense hey our fecal</p>
<p begin="02:07:27.929" end="02:07:34.829" style="s2">implants from clean you know a clean</p>
<p begin="02:07:31.889" end="02:07:36.239" style="s2">source so to speak so we have a chunk of</p>
<p begin="02:07:34.829" end="02:07:39.570" style="s2">working microbial mix we&#39;re working on</p>
<p begin="02:07:36.239" end="02:07:41.489" style="s2">right now though I&#39;m we&#39;re not that</p>
<p begin="02:07:39.570" end="02:07:43.710" style="s2">close yet because of what we want to do</p>
<p begin="02:07:41.489" end="02:07:45.119" style="s2">but I&#39;m excited about it cool I will say</p>
<p begin="02:07:43.710" end="02:07:46.400" style="s2">obviously we didn&#39;t get into</p>
<p begin="02:07:45.119" end="02:07:50.730" style="s2">psychedelics and entheogens</p>
<p begin="02:07:46.400" end="02:07:52.699" style="s2">no I have a whole section on that yeah</p>
<p begin="02:07:50.730" end="02:07:54.900" style="s2">and we didn&#39;t get into any of the</p>
<p begin="02:07:52.699" end="02:07:57.539" style="s2">psycho-emotional psycho-spiritual work</p>
<p begin="02:07:54.900" end="02:07:59.280" style="s2">right but on the jist evolutionary</p>
<p begin="02:07:57.539" end="02:08:01.230" style="s2">vironment not I will make a thought in</p>
<p begin="02:07:59.280" end="02:08:03.300" style="s2">closing is just like a statin is</p>
<p begin="02:08:01.230" end="02:08:05.070" style="s2">optimizing for one thing right lower</p>
<p begin="02:08:03.300" end="02:08:06.599" style="s2">your cholesterol without looking at hey</p>
<p begin="02:08:05.070" end="02:08:08.219" style="s2">is the cholesterol maybe protecting the</p>
<p begin="02:08:06.599" end="02:08:10.050" style="s2">arterial system from oxidative damage</p>
<p begin="02:08:08.219" end="02:08:12.360" style="s2">and that&#39;s not a good idea or what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="02:08:10.050" end="02:08:14.760" style="s2">whole rest of the story going on when we</p>
<p begin="02:08:12.360" end="02:08:15.659" style="s2">optimize for something that is affecting</p>
<p begin="02:08:14.760" end="02:08:17.010" style="s2">a lot of other things and we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="02:08:15.659" end="02:08:19.170" style="s2">paying attention we get extra knowledge</p>
<p begin="02:08:17.010" end="02:08:22.289" style="s2">right which is also called side effect</p>
<p begin="02:08:19.170" end="02:08:24.929" style="s2">we built the entire world the human</p>
<p begin="02:08:22.289" end="02:08:26.309" style="s2">built world for a few purposes and ways</p>
<p begin="02:08:24.929" end="02:08:29.610" style="s2">that affected a lot of other things so</p>
<p begin="02:08:26.309" end="02:08:31.679" style="s2">we build a house to protect us from the</p>
<p begin="02:08:29.610" end="02:08:33.840" style="s2">elements and give us a safe place to be</p>
<p begin="02:08:31.679" end="02:08:35.429" style="s2">and then maybe for a certain aspects of</p>
<p begin="02:08:33.840" end="02:08:37.949" style="s2">aesthetics but we didn&#39;t pay attention</p>
<p begin="02:08:35.429" end="02:08:39.900" style="s2">to oh well there&#39;s actually chemistry</p>
<p begin="02:08:37.949" end="02:08:42.239" style="s2">that&#39;s in the paint that is affecting us</p>
<p begin="02:08:39.900" end="02:08:45.119" style="s2">and oh yeah the fungicides that are in</p>
<p begin="02:08:42.239" end="02:08:47.369" style="s2">there that are making fungicide</p>
<p begin="02:08:45.119" end="02:08:48.539" style="s2">resistant funguses that are why we have</p>
<p begin="02:08:47.369" end="02:08:50.190" style="s2">an issue with mold Minh never did before</p>
<p begin="02:08:48.539" end="02:08:53.429" style="s2">oh that that actually is an important</p>
<p begin="02:08:50.190" end="02:08:54.989" style="s2">thing like in the drywall paint so in</p>
<p begin="02:08:53.429" end="02:08:57.929" style="s2">the paint in the 70s started having</p>
<p begin="02:08:54.989" end="02:09:01.679" style="s2">fungicides added resist mold so then the</p>
<p begin="02:08:57.929" end="02:09:03.480" style="s2">mold became super MRSA mold okay that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:09:01.679" end="02:09:05.389" style="s2">insane so the reason everyone has mold</p>
<p begin="02:09:03.480" end="02:09:06.889" style="s2">issues when we lived with mold forever</p>
<p begin="02:09:05.389" end="02:09:11.360" style="s2">very environment is because this is</p>
<p begin="02:09:06.889" end="02:09:14.719" style="s2">mutant mold oh my god so but even sons</p>
<p begin="02:09:11.360" end="02:09:16.460" style="s2">like you know the the color and angle</p>
<p begin="02:09:14.719" end="02:09:17.989" style="s2">right all of these end up affecting the</p>
<p begin="02:09:16.460" end="02:09:19.940" style="s2">the psyche this field of environmental</p>
<p begin="02:09:17.989" end="02:09:22.190" style="s2">Sykes Alegre if you&#39;re in an area where</p>
<p begin="02:09:19.940" end="02:09:24.139" style="s2">there&#39;s graffiti and trash on the ground</p>
<p begin="02:09:22.190" end="02:09:26.060" style="s2">in the walls this kind of environmental</p>
<p begin="02:09:24.139" end="02:09:27.679" style="s2">psych studies been done many times if if</p>
<p begin="02:09:26.060" end="02:09:29.449" style="s2">you just paint over the graffiti and</p>
<p begin="02:09:27.679" end="02:09:32.000" style="s2">clean up the trash violent crime drops</p>
<p begin="02:09:29.449" end="02:09:33.230" style="s2">like 30 to 50 percent Wow and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:09:32.000" end="02:09:35.810" style="s2">because you think about what the</p>
<p begin="02:09:33.230" end="02:09:39.050" style="s2">environments transmitting runnier there</p>
<p begin="02:09:35.810" end="02:09:41.389" style="s2">is one this is a wasteland and I&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="02:09:39.050" end="02:09:43.369" style="s2">survival mode and to this is a place</p>
<p begin="02:09:41.389" end="02:09:44.630" style="s2">where law doesn&#39;t operate mmm-hmm right</p>
<p begin="02:09:43.369" end="02:09:46.880" style="s2">cuz yeah as I&#39;ve been broken and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:09:44.630" end="02:09:48.860" style="s2">not rectified right and as soon as you</p>
<p begin="02:09:46.880" end="02:09:50.780" style="s2">fix those things how violent human</p>
<p begin="02:09:48.860" end="02:09:52.489" style="s2">beings are is being changed at the like</p>
<p begin="02:09:50.780" end="02:09:55.909" style="s2">50 percent level by an environmental</p>
<p begin="02:09:52.489" end="02:09:58.580" style="s2">psyche right I&#39;ve heard David Hawkins</p>
<p begin="02:09:55.909" end="02:10:00.400" style="s2">talk about that he called it the broken</p>
<p begin="02:09:58.580" end="02:10:02.330" style="s2">window theory you know you have a</p>
<p begin="02:10:00.400" end="02:10:03.980" style="s2">building in the ghetto and it gets</p>
<p begin="02:10:02.330" end="02:10:05.210" style="s2">ignored and then someone breaks the</p>
<p begin="02:10:03.980" end="02:10:06.619" style="s2">window and then someone comes along</p>
<p begin="02:10:05.210" end="02:10:08.060" style="s2">breaks another window then comes the</p>
<p begin="02:10:06.619" end="02:10:09.320" style="s2">goofy then the drug dealers on the</p>
<p begin="02:10:08.060" end="02:10:11.960" style="s2">corner and ever I never thought about</p>
<p begin="02:10:09.320" end="02:10:13.969" style="s2">the kind of mechanics of it that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="02:10:11.960" end="02:10:16.429" style="s2">interesting it&#39;s I guess the it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="02:10:13.969" end="02:10:17.900" style="s2">the level of consciousness of anything</p>
<p begin="02:10:16.429" end="02:10:19.820" style="s2">could you say would you frame it in that</p>
<p begin="02:10:17.900" end="02:10:22.730" style="s2">way I would say that&#39;s a way of reducing</p>
<p begin="02:10:19.820" end="02:10:25.790" style="s2">the complexity of it right um which is</p>
<p begin="02:10:22.730" end="02:10:27.980" style="s2">kind of my thing I interview people like</p>
<p begin="02:10:25.790" end="02:10:30.889" style="s2">year ago to squish that down into a</p>
<p begin="02:10:27.980" end="02:10:33.080" style="s2">bite-sized thought but if I mean so if</p>
<p begin="02:10:30.889" end="02:10:37.460" style="s2">you go into a cathedral they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="02:10:33.080" end="02:10:40.820" style="s2">environmental psych and so the sound and</p>
<p begin="02:10:37.460" end="02:10:42.770" style="s2">the smell and the visual and every</p>
<p begin="02:10:40.820" end="02:10:45.139" style="s2">aspect of the sensory process is</p>
<p begin="02:10:42.770" end="02:10:47.420" style="s2">designed to uplift and exalt it but then</p>
<p begin="02:10:45.139" end="02:10:49.730" style="s2">specifically that it&#39;s narrow and very</p>
<p begin="02:10:47.420" end="02:10:51.920" style="s2">high has a certain effect that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:10:49.730" end="02:10:54.139" style="s2">different than if it was wide and high</p>
<p begin="02:10:51.920" end="02:10:57.139" style="s2">or if it was not high right which is</p>
<p begin="02:10:54.139" end="02:10:59.659" style="s2">you&#39;re very focused on up and so then</p>
<p begin="02:10:57.139" end="02:11:01.610" style="s2">you feel very small and you can both</p>
<p begin="02:10:59.659" end="02:11:03.530" style="s2">have a sense of feeling you know and</p>
<p begin="02:11:01.610" end="02:11:05.420" style="s2">then the priest is halfway between you</p>
<p begin="02:11:03.530" end="02:11:05.810" style="s2">and where Jesus is up there and where</p>
<p begin="02:11:05.420" end="02:11:08.360" style="s2">God is</p>
<p begin="02:11:05.810" end="02:11:10.100" style="s2">and so both if you want look at the</p>
<p begin="02:11:08.360" end="02:11:12.590" style="s2">cynical side of the this is how you make</p>
<p begin="02:11:10.100" end="02:11:14.000" style="s2">a good authority Rhian kind of dynamic</p>
<p begin="02:11:12.590" end="02:11:15.349" style="s2">where everybody feels small and</p>
<p begin="02:11:14.000" end="02:11:17.150" style="s2">Authority up there but also the</p>
<p begin="02:11:15.349" end="02:11:19.169" style="s2">beautiful the mystical side of people</p>
<p begin="02:11:17.150" end="02:11:21.599" style="s2">feeling a sense of all and exaltation</p>
<p begin="02:11:19.169" end="02:11:23.189" style="s2">okay the environmental psychology of how</p>
<p begin="02:11:21.599" end="02:11:25.289" style="s2">those buildings are done induced state</p>
<p begin="02:11:23.189" end="02:11:26.729" style="s2">right just like Burning Man induce a</p>
<p begin="02:11:25.289" end="02:11:30.389" style="s2">state because of the environment even if</p>
<p begin="02:11:26.729" end="02:11:32.249" style="s2">you don&#39;t period so what we are</p>
<p begin="02:11:30.389" end="02:11:34.469" style="s2">realizing is that we have built a world</p>
<p begin="02:11:32.249" end="02:11:35.969" style="s2">that we are not well adapted to all</p>
<p begin="02:11:34.469" end="02:11:37.260" style="s2">right and that&#39;s affecting us in a lot</p>
<p begin="02:11:35.969" end="02:11:39.329" style="s2">of ways that we didn&#39;t pay attention to</p>
<p begin="02:11:37.260" end="02:11:41.789" style="s2">that are mostly not good for us and so</p>
<p begin="02:11:39.329" end="02:11:44.010" style="s2">there is this task that you and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="02:11:41.789" end="02:11:45.959" style="s2">good for the planet right and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="02:11:44.010" end="02:11:48.449" style="s2">good for us so there&#39;s this task of how</p>
<p begin="02:11:45.959" end="02:11:50.399" style="s2">do we rebuild the entire physical built</p>
<p begin="02:11:48.449" end="02:11:52.919" style="s2">world in a way where the goal the</p>
<p begin="02:11:50.399" end="02:11:55.349" style="s2">primary goal is not you know it being</p>
<p begin="02:11:52.919" end="02:11:56.789" style="s2">inexpensive or fast or aesthetically</p>
<p begin="02:11:55.349" end="02:11:57.989" style="s2">beautiful those are all partial goals</p>
<p begin="02:11:56.789" end="02:11:59.789" style="s2">the primary goal is that it is</p>
<p begin="02:11:57.989" end="02:12:02.699" style="s2">enlightening the humans that are</p>
<p begin="02:11:59.789" end="02:12:04.289" style="s2">inhabiting it how do you create a built</p>
<p begin="02:12:02.699" end="02:12:06.090" style="s2">worlds it makes the healthiest most</p>
<p begin="02:12:04.289" end="02:12:07.409" style="s2">enlightened most pro-social human beings</p>
<p begin="02:12:06.090" end="02:12:09.059" style="s2">that are inhabiting it and how do we</p>
<p begin="02:12:07.409" end="02:12:12.419" style="s2">rebuild the entire world of that in mind</p>
<p begin="02:12:09.059" end="02:12:14.939" style="s2">in in relationship to you know harmony</p>
<p begin="02:12:12.419" end="02:12:16.739" style="s2">with the ecosystem so that&#39;s the biohack</p>
<p begin="02:12:14.939" end="02:12:19.139" style="s2">that is most interesting to me that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:12:16.739" end="02:12:20.059" style="s2">amazing dude I love that really good way</p>
<p begin="02:12:19.139" end="02:12:23.130" style="s2">to sum it up</p>
<p begin="02:12:20.059" end="02:12:25.709" style="s2">alright so closing question who have</p>
<p begin="02:12:23.130" end="02:12:27.539" style="s2">been three teachers or teachings that</p>

<p begin="02:12:40.070" end="02:12:44.010" style="s2">and preferably something that one could</p>
<p begin="02:12:42.630" end="02:12:46.289" style="s2">go look up or we can put in the show</p>
<p begin="02:12:44.010" end="02:12:48.449" style="s2">nuts you know Meister Fuller</p>
<p begin="02:12:46.289" end="02:12:51.019" style="s2">whatever even Buckminster Fuller would</p>

<p begin="02:13:04.320" end="02:13:08.280" style="s2">on the list and then ordering three is</p>
<p begin="02:13:06.479" end="02:13:09.749" style="s2">impossible for me so I&#39;ll just worry the</p>
<p begin="02:13:08.280" end="02:13:10.619" style="s2">ones that came to mind first yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="02:13:09.749" end="02:13:12.780" style="s2">that&#39;s the idea</p>
<p begin="02:13:10.619" end="02:13:15.360" style="s2">finite and infinite games by James cars&#39;</p>
<p begin="02:13:12.780" end="02:13:17.189" style="s2">is a great book it&#39;s a book that will</p>

<p begin="02:13:27.269" end="02:13:32.639" style="s2">is a great one and then the next one</p>
<p begin="02:13:29.880" end="02:13:33.010" style="s2">came to mind was Anthony de Mello was</p>
