<p begin="00:00:23.220" end="00:00:33.990" style="s2">today I&#39;m gonna be talking about how I</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.840" end="00:00:35.640" style="s2">think about meditation and I&#39;m you know</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.990" end="00:00:37.320" style="s2">I&#39;ve been I was reflecting on this</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.640" end="00:00:41.090" style="s2">recently we just finished a retreat with</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.320" end="00:00:43.620" style="s2">shin zenyatta he was at the monastery</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.090" end="00:00:47.220" style="s2">there&#39;s this very significant for me</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.620" end="00:00:50.100" style="s2">because you know as I&#39;ve been practicing</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.220" end="00:00:52.290" style="s2">now for about 12 years and in the first</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.100" end="00:00:54.360" style="s2">year or two of my kind of practicing</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.290" end="00:00:57.180" style="s2">life I&#39;ve got introduced to Shinzon&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.360" end="00:00:59.790" style="s2">science of enlightenment audio series</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.180" end="00:01:02.820" style="s2">like you know 20 hours long just</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.790" end="00:01:05.370" style="s2">Shenzhen geeking out about how amazing</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.820" end="00:01:07.260" style="s2">it is that meditation and science are</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.370" end="00:01:10.290" style="s2">coming together and just been really</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.260" end="00:01:13.200" style="s2">captured my imagination and really</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.290" end="00:01:16.710" style="s2">propelled me along this path the factors</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.200" end="00:01:19.470" style="s2">that I&#39;ve been on now twelve the</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.710" end="00:01:21.420" style="s2">monastery fervor for three years with it</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.470" end="00:01:22.560" style="s2">if going to Cyprus year and a half which</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.420" end="00:01:26.549" style="s2">if you don&#39;t know is a very kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.560" end="00:01:31.740" style="s2">weird bootcamp like experience of</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.549" end="00:01:33.540" style="s2">meditation and all along the way I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.740" end="00:01:37.440" style="s2">been very successful life</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.540" end="00:01:39.180" style="s2">and it was partly having to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.440" end="00:01:43.290" style="s2">same inquiry that shins and I was like</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.180" end="00:01:49.230" style="s2">what exactly are we doing when we sit</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.290" end="00:01:53.490" style="s2">down and are just quiet and we turn it</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.230" end="00:01:57.080" style="s2">in so to speak and do something follow</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.490" end="00:01:59.610" style="s2">our breath pay attention to our</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.080" end="00:02:05.060" style="s2">sensations how can we kind of make sense</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.610" end="00:02:07.409" style="s2">of what it is that we&#39;re doing such that</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.060" end="00:02:13.020" style="s2">we have confidence</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.409" end="00:02:15.810" style="s2">and creativity and such that we can sort</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.020" end="00:02:19.230" style="s2">of allow our experience and our insights</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.810" end="00:02:21.750" style="s2">to grow in accordance with an</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.230" end="00:02:23.400" style="s2">understanding a conceptual understanding</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.750" end="00:02:26.880" style="s2">of what it is that we&#39;re doing when we</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.400" end="00:02:29.519" style="s2">sit now most of the kind of approaches</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.880" end="00:02:32.760" style="s2">you find will say something like if you</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.519" end="00:02:36.510" style="s2">do this meditation then you will</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.760" end="00:02:39.690" style="s2">experience these benefits but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.510" end="00:02:41.640" style="s2">missing piece there right like why is it</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.690" end="00:02:45.090" style="s2">that you will experience these benefits</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.640" end="00:02:47.940" style="s2">right so if I drop an apple from my hand</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.090" end="00:02:49.200" style="s2">it will fall to the ground but what is</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.940" end="00:02:51.239" style="s2">missing there is the theory of gravity</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.200" end="00:02:54.540" style="s2">right so there&#39;s some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.239" end="00:02:57.120" style="s2">explanatory power that we can access</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.540" end="00:02:58.890" style="s2">I believe that helps us make sense with</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.120" end="00:03:01.640" style="s2">what it is that we&#39;re doing when we</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.890" end="00:03:14.480" style="s2">spend 100 hours on the cushions</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.640" end="00:03:17.489" style="s2">observing our experience so unlike other</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.480" end="00:03:20.579" style="s2">Sunday&#39;s that I would invite people to</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.489" end="00:03:23.069" style="s2">ask questions like well I&#39;m giving this</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.579" end="00:03:25.130" style="s2">talk just because I don&#39;t want to like</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.069" end="00:03:36.840" style="s2">lose you and then keep going</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.130" end="00:03:43.920" style="s2">yeah can I ask you to put the mic on so</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.840" end="00:03:47.600" style="s2">feel free to ask so the basic idea that</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.920" end="00:03:50.700" style="s2">kind of where this whole frame starts is</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.600" end="00:03:55.250" style="s2">that the recognition that as human</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.700" end="00:03:56.819" style="s2">beings we have this perhaps unique</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.250" end="00:03:59.819" style="s2">capacity</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.819" end="00:04:01.680" style="s2">to look at things in different ways and</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.819" end="00:04:05.489" style="s2">my favorite example to use for this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.680" end="00:04:10.109" style="s2">like treats right now you could look at</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.489" end="00:04:12.900" style="s2">that tree as a biological organism and</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.109" end="00:04:15.959" style="s2">you can understand the way that it takes</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.900" end="00:04:18.959" style="s2">nutrients from the soil you know it uses</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.959" end="00:04:20.639" style="s2">sunlight to create energy so on and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.959" end="00:04:23.130" style="s2">forth you can understand it as a</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.639" end="00:04:26.759" style="s2">biological organism you can also</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.130" end="00:04:28.800" style="s2">understand it as a resource right that</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.759" end="00:04:30.870" style="s2">you could extract that you could take</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.800" end="00:04:33.389" style="s2">and turn it to wood that you could build</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.870" end="00:04:35.400" style="s2">a house with or perhaps the the leaves</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.389" end="00:04:37.139" style="s2">are some kind of nice right that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.400" end="00:04:39.300" style="s2">different way of looking at what that</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.139" end="00:04:42.900" style="s2">tree is you could also look at it as</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.300" end="00:04:46.320" style="s2">some wisdom traditions do as a spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.900" end="00:04:48.750" style="s2">friend that&#39;s another way of looking at</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.320" end="00:04:52.410" style="s2">what it treats all of those ways of</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.750" end="00:04:55.680" style="s2">looking are available to us as humans</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.410" end="00:04:57.539" style="s2">and they may or not be may or may not be</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.680" end="00:05:00.570" style="s2">accessible to us but they aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.539" end="00:05:02.940" style="s2">available to us humans we all have the</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.570" end="00:05:05.639" style="s2">same kind of hardware that&#39;s capable of</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.940" end="00:05:08.010" style="s2">accessing those diversity of ways of</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.639" end="00:05:10.800" style="s2">looking and many more right and so for</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.010" end="00:05:12.659" style="s2">any given thing there are many different</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.800" end="00:05:15.570" style="s2">ways of looking so this is the the core</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.659" end="00:05:20.070" style="s2">kind of thesis the the premise on which</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.570" end="00:05:21.900" style="s2">this whole framework is based so I say</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.070" end="00:05:25.080" style="s2">you can look at things in different ways</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.900" end="00:05:27.510" style="s2">I mean you can you can sense things in</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.080" end="00:05:30.330" style="s2">different ways you can relate to things</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.510" end="00:05:32.220" style="s2">in different ways you can conceive of</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.330" end="00:05:35.190" style="s2">things in different ways and ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.220" end="00:05:37.530" style="s2">you&#39;re able to participate with things</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.190" end="00:05:41.900" style="s2">in different ways that isn&#39;t an option</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.530" end="00:05:41.900" style="s2">that&#39;s available to us that&#39;s here</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.310" end="00:05:48.989" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.749" end="00:05:50.939" style="s2">the critical or one of the critical</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.989" end="00:05:54.360" style="s2">insights for me is that out of each of</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.939" end="00:05:57.649" style="s2">these ways of seeing a new world is</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.360" end="00:06:03.049" style="s2">created and discovered so for instance</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.649" end="00:06:06.269" style="s2">the resource acquisition lens right if I</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.049" end="00:06:10.199" style="s2">put that on and look at the world</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.269" end="00:06:14.579" style="s2">through that way of seeing certain</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.199" end="00:06:17.369" style="s2">things certain understandings become</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.579" end="00:06:19.979" style="s2">available certain paths open up</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.369" end="00:06:22.679" style="s2">throughout history in fact to a large</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.979" end="00:06:24.119" style="s2">degree we can look around and see ah you</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.679" end="00:06:27.239" style="s2">know the world that we have created</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.119" end="00:06:31.079" style="s2">together is in large part a result of</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.239" end="00:06:34.529" style="s2">that way of seeing operating within many</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.079" end="00:06:36.659" style="s2">human minds at once so the way of seeing</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.529" end="00:06:39.629" style="s2">that sees the world and starts to think</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.659" end="00:06:42.059" style="s2">what&#39;s relevant here is what I can</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.629" end="00:06:45.360" style="s2">extract what I can turn into profit what</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.059" end="00:06:48.139" style="s2">I can take and make into you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.360" end="00:06:51.829" style="s2">products and resources what I can</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.139" end="00:06:55.349" style="s2">capitalize and I said or you know the</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.829" end="00:06:58.379" style="s2">way of seeing that we call science that</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.349" end="00:07:01.110" style="s2">seeks to understand how it is that these</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.379" end="00:07:03.899" style="s2">things work how they interlock with each</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.110" end="00:07:08.219" style="s2">other so we can tell stories that allow</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.899" end="00:07:10.169" style="s2">us to explain the way things are such</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.219" end="00:07:13.909" style="s2">that we can create technology that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.169" end="00:07:13.909" style="s2">way of seeing</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.719" end="00:07:26.650" style="s2">so the</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.639" end="00:07:33.050" style="s2">one of the other pieces to this is that</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.650" end="00:07:36.770" style="s2">there&#39;s not there&#39;s not any way to</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.050" end="00:07:38.479" style="s2">escape this situation unfortunately you</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.770" end="00:07:41.030" style="s2">can&#39;t say oh there are ways of seeing</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.479" end="00:07:44.180" style="s2">I&#39;m just gonna stop seeing things a</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.030" end="00:07:46.189" style="s2">certain way I invited to try see you do</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.180" end="00:07:48.080" style="s2">that and see what happens</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.189" end="00:07:50.270" style="s2">you&#39;ll find that you kind of just go</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.080" end="00:07:52.909" style="s2">into another way of seeing it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.270" end="00:07:55.969" style="s2">everywhere we look there is a way of</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.909" end="00:07:59.000" style="s2">seen to be found there&#39;s not like some</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.969" end="00:08:00.979" style="s2">place that&#39;s free from ways of seeing in</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.000" end="00:08:03.560" style="s2">fact that itself is the rather</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.979" end="00:08:05.330" style="s2">pernicious way of seeing you&#39;ll find it</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.560" end="00:08:07.759" style="s2">in many different philosophical systems</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.330" end="00:08:10.430" style="s2">the kind of view from nowhere right the</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.759" end="00:08:12.740" style="s2">idea that we&#39;re going to somehow look at</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.430" end="00:08:15.860" style="s2">things as if it&#39;s the one way to see</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.740" end="00:08:17.960" style="s2">things or beyond ways of seeing back to</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.860" end="00:08:20.870" style="s2">is a way of seeing that takes itself not</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.960" end="00:08:23.240" style="s2">to be able to see very confusing and</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.870" end="00:08:25.310" style="s2">that&#39;s part of how they you know weasels</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.240" end="00:08:30.550" style="s2">into your mind and occupies your</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.310" end="00:08:30.550" style="s2">attention deep sleep</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.110" end="00:09:07.640" style="s2">mm right yeah so there&#39;s no procession</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.740" end="00:09:12.500" style="s2">there might not be yes yes indeed yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.640" end="00:09:13.820" style="s2">and then that is exactly right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.500" end="00:09:15.980" style="s2">part of what we&#39;re attempting to do in</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.820" end="00:09:18.830" style="s2">meditation actually is is create less</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.980" end="00:09:20.690" style="s2">and less we might say complex ways of</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.830" end="00:09:24.350" style="s2">seeing funk discover less and less</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.690" end="00:09:26.480" style="s2">fabricated ways of being in the world</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.350" end="00:09:35.560" style="s2">and to resolve the will from heaven to</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.480" end="00:09:35.560" style="s2">choose yeah yes yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.440" end="00:09:46.350" style="s2">yeah so most most of the ways of seeing</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.590" end="00:09:50.820" style="s2">that we operate with are installed in us</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.350" end="00:09:53.460" style="s2">by culture family upbringing so on and</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.820" end="00:09:56.070" style="s2">so forth you know there are lots of ways</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.460" end="00:09:59.460" style="s2">of seeing what a human being is but you</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.070" end="00:10:01.980" style="s2">might try on it way of looking at human</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.460" end="00:10:04.230" style="s2">beings that sees them as collections of</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.980" end="00:10:06.720" style="s2">ways of seeing seeing yourself as a</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.230" end="00:10:09.690" style="s2">collection of ways of seeing habitual</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.720" end="00:10:14.210" style="s2">ways that you see and participate with</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.690" end="00:10:17.100" style="s2">reality right subject/object</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.210" end="00:10:20.610" style="s2">what am I going to do with my life how</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.100" end="00:10:26.190" style="s2">many ways of seeing are kind of implicit</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.610" end="00:10:30.270" style="s2">in that state my life what am I going to</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.190" end="00:10:32.640" style="s2">do you see but this is an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.270" end="00:10:41.400" style="s2">way of framing lots of different</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.640" end="00:10:44.760" style="s2">situations and kind of questions so the</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.400" end="00:10:50.000" style="s2">reason why this is all a big deal for me</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.760" end="00:10:53.250" style="s2">is that we end up constructing our</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.000" end="00:10:56.370" style="s2">experience through the ways of seeing</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.250" end="00:10:58.890" style="s2">that we use and so like I said if you</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.370" end="00:11:01.860" style="s2">have a way of seeing that seize</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.890" end="00:11:05.070" style="s2">resources or you know sees people as</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.860" end="00:11:08.100" style="s2">being means to end you create you end up</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.070" end="00:11:10.350" style="s2">creating a world in which that is the</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.100" end="00:11:13.470" style="s2">world you create an experience in which</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.350" end="00:11:16.640" style="s2">that is the experience because you using</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.470" end="00:11:19.500" style="s2">that way of seeing to organize the world</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.640" end="00:11:21.630" style="s2">right and get me have that freedom and</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.500" end="00:11:25.410" style="s2">so this is an invitation to recognize at</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.630" end="00:11:26.910" style="s2">rekted with that freedom so different</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.410" end="00:11:30.240" style="s2">ways of seeing create discover two</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.910" end="00:11:32.390" style="s2">worlds different others different sexes</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.240" end="00:11:35.130" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.390" end="00:11:37.440" style="s2">so when I just when I when I look at the</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.130" end="00:11:41.010" style="s2">world in a science wet I create and</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.440" end="00:11:43.740" style="s2">discover a scientific world oh the world</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.010" end="00:11:49.589" style="s2">is so scientific so logical sort word so</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.740" end="00:11:53.190" style="s2">rashly amazing when I look at the world</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.589" end="00:11:57.740" style="s2">as sacred and divine I create and</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.190" end="00:12:01.950" style="s2">discover a sacred and divine well dude</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.740" end="00:12:07.140" style="s2">we have that freedom we can do either</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.950" end="00:12:08.400" style="s2">one we have this and so you know of</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.140" end="00:12:11.520" style="s2">course there are many different criteria</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.400" end="00:12:14.160" style="s2">he might use to select what ways of</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.520" end="00:12:16.740" style="s2">seeing you want to leverage anymore as I</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.160" end="00:12:19.920" style="s2">said science has its own criteria like</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.740" end="00:12:23.339" style="s2">soundness and symmetry validity evidence</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.920" end="00:12:26.160" style="s2">so on and so forth and that&#39;s kind like</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.339" end="00:12:26.760" style="s2">trying to do a particular fan and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.160" end="00:12:32.220" style="s2">beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.760" end="00:12:34.080" style="s2">good propria in the context of most</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.220" end="00:12:37.500" style="s2">forms of a buddhist interpretive</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.080" end="00:12:42.860" style="s2">practice who say select ways of seeing</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.500" end="00:12:48.980" style="s2">that reduce our suffering we take on</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.860" end="00:12:50.930" style="s2">ways of seeing that reduce our suffering</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.980" end="00:12:54.190" style="s2">we might also try out ways of seeing</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.930" end="00:12:56.899" style="s2">that we can play with like meta which</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.190" end="00:12:59.320" style="s2">increase the sense of kindness of</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.899" end="00:13:02.660" style="s2">compassion and loveliness that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.320" end="00:13:05.899" style="s2">bucket but in general the kind of jewel</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.660" end="00:13:09.440" style="s2">at the heart of the Dharma is the</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.899" end="00:13:13.779" style="s2">collection of ways of seeing that erode</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.440" end="00:13:18.139" style="s2">a root dampen and ultimately end</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.779" end="00:13:20.329" style="s2">something and that happens by invoking</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.139" end="00:13:23.990" style="s2">them by practicing them by learning to</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.329" end="00:13:26.329" style="s2">see from this prescription is but it</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.990" end="00:13:30.139" style="s2">means the number of ways of seeing that</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.329" end="00:13:35.630" style="s2">the road suffer that lead to himself and</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.139" end="00:13:38.019" style="s2">they do that oh yes everything&#39;s sense</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.630" end="00:13:38.019" style="s2">of hearts</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.700" end="00:13:54.930" style="s2">so the usual example that I give is the</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.150" end="00:13:54.930" style="s2">three characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.510" end="00:14:04.660" style="s2">it may not familiar with the three</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.580" end="00:14:06.220" style="s2">characteristics so you&#39;ll probably know</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.660" end="00:14:08.110" style="s2">them what I say the three</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.220" end="00:14:10.960" style="s2">characteristics sometimes called the</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.110" end="00:14:16.660" style="s2">three marks of existence or impermanence</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.960" end="00:14:19.330" style="s2">suffering and knows the three marks</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.660" end="00:14:23.680" style="s2">three characteristics often these are</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.330" end="00:14:27.090" style="s2">presented in a lot of different learning</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.680" end="00:14:29.980" style="s2">communities as kind of like truths to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.090" end="00:14:33.310" style="s2">recognized or a body of like oh you</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.980" end="00:14:36.640" style="s2">should understand that everything is</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.310" end="00:14:39.400" style="s2">impermanent that all is suffering and</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.640" end="00:14:41.610" style="s2">then you don&#39;t have a self okay like so</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.400" end="00:14:44.710" style="s2">that creates interesting philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.610" end="00:14:47.200" style="s2">discussions perhaps but that&#39;s not how I</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.710" end="00:14:49.360" style="s2">think oh I would argue we ought to</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.200" end="00:14:53.410" style="s2">relate to these three characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.360" end="00:14:57.520" style="s2">instead I would say I would interpret it</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.410" end="00:15:00.330" style="s2">that the Buddha was suggesting three</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.520" end="00:15:05.110" style="s2">ways of seeing that we can actually use</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.330" end="00:15:07.740" style="s2">when we sit in meditation right so what</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.110" end="00:15:10.930" style="s2">is it like to take on the way of seeing</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.740" end="00:15:14.320" style="s2">that season what&#39;s most relevant in my</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.930" end="00:15:16.720" style="s2">experience is that it is improved and</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.320" end="00:15:19.300" style="s2">what does it mean to tune into that what</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.720" end="00:15:22.480" style="s2">does it mean to really look at that what</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.300" end="00:15:25.120" style="s2">does it mean to put that at the top of</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.480" end="00:15:27.280" style="s2">my life relevance landscape in my</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.120" end="00:15:29.140" style="s2">cognition in my mind in my perception of</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.280" end="00:15:31.570" style="s2">my phenomenology what does it what</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.140" end="00:15:33.670" style="s2">happens when I do that similarly what</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.570" end="00:15:36.640" style="s2">happens when I really looked at what</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.670" end="00:15:38.410" style="s2">creates suffering they notice as the</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.640" end="00:15:41.920" style="s2">said that like anytime there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.410" end="00:15:44.140" style="s2">resistance cleaning there&#39;s some amplify</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.920" end="00:15:47.080" style="s2">suffer what happens if I just allow my</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.140" end="00:15:50.320" style="s2">experience to be as this instead I just</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.080" end="00:15:54.220" style="s2">take that that&#39;s the way of seen Wow Wow</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.320" end="00:15:55.860" style="s2">or what if I notice that I can also take</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.220" end="00:15:57.370" style="s2">on this way of seeing the tiny flight</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.860" end="00:15:59.770" style="s2">this is it</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.370" end="00:16:01.420" style="s2">everything is just sort of happened this</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.770" end="00:16:05.170" style="s2">is kind of just happy there&#39;s not me</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.420" end="00:16:06.970" style="s2">agent doing a thing really least I can</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.170" end="00:16:08.920" style="s2">look at my experience that way where</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.970" end="00:16:11.860" style="s2">things are just sort of arising and</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.920" end="00:16:17.260" style="s2">passing away and I&#39;m not doing anything</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.860" end="00:16:21.490" style="s2">it&#39;s just what happens when we invoke</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.260" end="00:16:29.410" style="s2">those ways of seeing is that clinging</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.490" end="00:16:32.890" style="s2">yes weaker or lessened it&#39;s damp we let</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.410" end="00:16:35.560" style="s2">go and when we let go there&#39;s my self if</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.890" end="00:16:37.930" style="s2">there&#39;s an my favorite I&#39;m John chopped</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.560" end="00:16:40.960" style="s2">boxes you know if you let go a little</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.930" end="00:16:45.280" style="s2">bit a little bit of peace if you let go</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.960" end="00:16:46.570" style="s2">a little more over mark get setgo a lot</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.280" end="00:16:48.430" style="s2">no no a lot of easy you let go</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.570" end="00:16:51.790" style="s2">completely you&#39;ll know the peace of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.430" end="00:16:54.100" style="s2">Buddhist so that&#39;s really what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.790" end="00:16:59.050" style="s2">attempting to do when they meditate is</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.100" end="00:17:02.110" style="s2">in use take on ways of seeing that have</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.050" end="00:17:04.660" style="s2">the result of causing us to let go is</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.110" end="00:17:05.709" style="s2">why would we let go or why would we hold</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.660" end="00:17:08.220" style="s2">on our things are perfect there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.709" end="00:17:08.220" style="s2">passing away</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.540" end="00:17:14.000" style="s2">watch this question if you want but</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.760" end="00:17:17.090" style="s2">wondering about how the word suffering</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.000" end="00:17:19.670" style="s2">even invokes the way of see compared to</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.090" end="00:17:21.800" style="s2">some of the other translations of dukkha</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.670" end="00:17:26.410" style="s2">or just fundamental dissatisfaction or</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.800" end="00:17:26.410" style="s2">wondering if you might say that</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.670" end="00:17:36.370" style="s2">yeah interesting</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.160" end="00:17:40.690" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure what you have in mind like</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.370" end="00:17:42.630" style="s2">if I if I take the word suffering say</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.690" end="00:17:45.090" style="s2">for instance if I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.630" end="00:17:48.760" style="s2">characteristics yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.090" end="00:17:50.559" style="s2">if I ask is this suffering it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.760" end="00:17:54.880" style="s2">sometimes it doesn&#39;t match my answer</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.559" end="00:17:57.580" style="s2">last does this satisfy it&#39;s much more</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.880" end="00:17:59.890" style="s2">resonant yeah so when I think suffering</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.580" end="00:18:04.530" style="s2">or when I hear the word suffering</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.890" end="00:18:04.530" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t seem can capture doesn&#39;t seem</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.299" end="00:18:14.260" style="s2">like it seems like that&#39;s a way of</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.770" end="00:18:16.600" style="s2">seeing itself a lot of people tend to</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.260" end="00:18:19.419" style="s2">bring to it which kind of doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.600" end="00:18:21.039" style="s2">for me yeah yeah well so I think the key</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.419" end="00:18:23.289" style="s2">among yours what you said is it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.039" end="00:18:25.210" style="s2">work for you right and so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.289" end="00:18:27.640" style="s2">things that I most appreciate about this</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.210" end="00:18:29.320" style="s2">having this frame is that it enables</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.640" end="00:18:31.900" style="s2">that kind of sense to go what is like</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.320" end="00:18:34.090" style="s2">I&#39;m not doing this because like somebody</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.900" end="00:18:35.559" style="s2">gave me this reitman ritual I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.090" end="00:18:37.030" style="s2">gonna like follow my breath a million</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.559" end="00:18:40.120" style="s2">times and tell something happens I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.030" end="00:18:42.100" style="s2">happy right I understand what it is that</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.120" end="00:18:43.120" style="s2">I&#39;m like kind of attempting to</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.100" end="00:18:46.059" style="s2">accomplish here</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.120" end="00:18:49.840" style="s2">and for me like oh this understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.059" end="00:18:52.480" style="s2">suffering doesn&#39;t really work like it</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.840" end="00:18:54.669" style="s2">doesn&#39;t kind of land in my experience</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.480" end="00:18:57.549" style="s2">right it doesn&#39;t allow me to release</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.669" end="00:18:59.620" style="s2">plain and really suffering be happier</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.549" end="00:19:01.240" style="s2">and so maybe it&#39;s more yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.620" end="00:19:03.760" style="s2">fundamental this fast factor maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.240" end="00:19:05.710" style="s2">more like I&#39;m really curious about where</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.760" end="00:19:08.200" style="s2">this is all going I want to know what it</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.710" end="00:19:10.240" style="s2">means to unfair Akane my experience I</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.200" end="00:19:13.240" style="s2">want to know what emptiness is it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.240" end="00:19:15.820" style="s2">about suffering it&#39;s not like the joy of</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.240" end="00:19:17.679" style="s2">exploring what consciousness is capable</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.820" end="00:19:19.780" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s more than your thing right</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.679" end="00:19:22.600" style="s2">but it allows us to kind of get out of</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.780" end="00:19:24.669" style="s2">the constrictions of dogma and like this</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.600" end="00:19:26.780" style="s2">opposed to and enter into a more</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.669" end="00:19:28.940" style="s2">creative playful life</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.780" end="00:19:31.130" style="s2">I would say like a sovereign position in</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.940" end="00:19:32.960" style="s2">relationship to our practice</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.130" end="00:19:35.710" style="s2">that&#39;s a good question this is suffering</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.960" end="00:19:42.159" style="s2">something that lands fear wasn&#39;t more</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.710" end="00:19:42.159" style="s2">motivates and so</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.179" end="00:20:01.529" style="s2">to a little bit of practice with that</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.059" end="00:20:05.479" style="s2">see what happens</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.529" end="00:20:05.479" style="s2">do they have any questions</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.419" end="00:20:17.190" style="s2">so I&#39;ll just lay out what I&#39;m intending</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.589" end="00:20:19.229" style="s2">to do here so I&#39;m going to do guided</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.190" end="00:20:22.549" style="s2">meditation first we&#39;re gonna do a little</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.229" end="00:20:25.950" style="s2">bit of samadhi practice concentration</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.549" end="00:20:28.769" style="s2">cultivate a little bit of well-being and</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.950" end="00:20:32.009" style="s2">then we&#39;ll use that as a basis to</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.769" end="00:20:34.019" style="s2">explore the three ways of seeing that I</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.009" end="00:20:37.889" style="s2">mentioned the permanence suffering you</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.019" end="00:20:39.659" style="s2">know self don&#39;t feel like you have to</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.889" end="00:20:41.369" style="s2">follow along if you wanted to stick with</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.659" end="00:20:44.009" style="s2">some audience just keep cultivating a</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.369" end="00:20:45.629" style="s2">sense of well-being a calm and peace do</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.009" end="00:20:47.039" style="s2">that if you get to be impermanence</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.629" end="00:20:48.869" style="s2">characteristic and it&#39;s really jamming</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.039" end="00:20:53.279" style="s2">for you and you like it it&#39;s good just</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.869" end="00:20:58.829" style="s2">stick it back don&#39;t move on and yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.279" end="00:20:59.999" style="s2">also feel free to try all three like if</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.829" end="00:21:10.919" style="s2">you don&#39;t get this issue to go to</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.999" end="00:21:13.320" style="s2">practice so there&#39;s a link there we</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.919" end="00:21:18.509" style="s2">don&#39;t like so how does meditation and</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.320" end="00:21:22.469" style="s2">your view work what would as manatee</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.509" end="00:21:23.909" style="s2">should do in the memory of that what</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.469" end="00:21:31.369" style="s2">does meditation do it</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.909" end="00:21:35.039" style="s2">yeah okay thank you yeah so in this</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.369" end="00:21:37.889" style="s2">frame we might see that meditation</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.039" end="00:21:43.440" style="s2">accomplishes a couple of things one is</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.889" end="00:21:45.089" style="s2">this a way to release ourselves from the</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.440" end="00:21:48.880" style="s2">ways of seem that have been installed in</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.089" end="00:21:51.070" style="s2">us by our culture by our family</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.880" end="00:21:52.690" style="s2">and this is extremely essential in</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.070" end="00:21:54.430" style="s2">today&#39;s world because the ways of seeing</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.690" end="00:21:57.340" style="s2">that are currently operating on our</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.430" end="00:21:59.470" style="s2">planet is hurtling us towards extinction</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.340" end="00:22:02.830" style="s2">or the possible a decision so we need to</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.470" end="00:22:05.500" style="s2">sort of uninstall the current operating</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.830" end="00:22:07.120" style="s2">system and meditation you can do that by</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.500" end="00:22:09.150" style="s2">leveraging ways of seeing that reveal</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.120" end="00:22:10.660" style="s2">the emptiness of all the ways of seeing</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.150" end="00:22:16.540" style="s2">including the ones that have been</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.660" end="00:22:19.270" style="s2">installments agriculture the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.540" end="00:22:21.790" style="s2">that it allows us to do is to play with</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.270" end="00:22:25.960" style="s2">new existing right once we kind of get</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.790" end="00:22:28.270" style="s2">into this ability to deconstruct our</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.960" end="00:22:29.950" style="s2">perception and our ways of seeing that</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.270" end="00:22:32.410" style="s2">have been installed to us we can then</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.950" end="00:22:34.870" style="s2">playfully deploy new ones right so we</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.410" end="00:22:38.080" style="s2">can see that maybe what was it like to</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.870" end="00:22:40.450" style="s2">live in a world in which like everybody</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.080" end="00:22:42.160" style="s2">is my friend made a traditional way of</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.450" end="00:22:43.810" style="s2">seeing that the Buddhists recommend all</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.160" end="00:22:46.360" style="s2">our my friends you know may all be happy</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.810" end="00:22:48.100" style="s2">it&#39;s a way of seeing and you live from</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.360" end="00:22:51.820" style="s2">that it creates a different world and</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.100" end="00:22:53.650" style="s2">maybe that world maybe that way is</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.820" end="00:22:58.750" style="s2">participating world is is more</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.650" end="00:23:02.440" style="s2">appropriate more useful now or leads to</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.750" end="00:23:04.960" style="s2">more activists or more well-being or joy</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.440" end="00:23:08.200" style="s2">later and so it gives you that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.960" end="00:23:10.440" style="s2">like platform for experimentation as</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.200" end="00:23:10.440" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.020" end="00:23:21.660" style="s2">so let&#39;s right now</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.480" end="00:24:00.549" style="s2">to begin invite you to straighten that</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.960" end="00:24:09.500" style="s2">we find a posture that feels a lot</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.770" end="00:24:12.770" style="s2">aligned</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.050" end="00:24:19.520" style="s2">and as possible as a sense of nobility</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.930" end="00:24:41.700" style="s2">might be possible to find the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.040" end="00:24:49.220" style="s2">energetic tone of alertness of the life</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.700" end="00:24:49.220" style="s2">as you can get into that fashion</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.440" end="00:25:17.240" style="s2">and I need to open up to your experience</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.440" end="00:25:27.040" style="s2">you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:28:13.460" end="01:28:23.960" style="s2">we adopt these ways of seeing is because</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.280" end="01:28:25.730" style="s2">they were do separate me yeah curious</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.960" end="01:28:29.719" style="s2">your thoughts on that session yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.730" end="01:28:32.019" style="s2">tricky I think though that we can make</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.719" end="01:28:33.829" style="s2">this kind of tension a lot easier body</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.019" end="01:28:35.989" style="s2">really just getting into our</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.829" end="01:28:38.210" style="s2">phenomenology right just getting into</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.989" end="01:28:42.519" style="s2">our actual experience moment by moment</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.210" end="01:28:45.650" style="s2">and in that we can notice like am i</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.519" end="01:28:47.929" style="s2">actually resisting my experience like am</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.650" end="01:28:52.840" style="s2">i wanting it to change in this moment</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.929" end="01:28:55.130" style="s2">and what does that do to my experience</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.840" end="01:28:57.469" style="s2">right so we can this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.130" end="01:28:59.269" style="s2">philosophical position like ah that you</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.469" end="01:29:00.380" style="s2">are meditating and therefore you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.269" end="01:29:01.779" style="s2">want things to be the way they are</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.380" end="01:29:04.359" style="s2">because if you did</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.779" end="01:29:06.939" style="s2">and like we can kind of get wrapped up</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.359" end="01:29:10.109" style="s2">into that but it seems paradoxical and</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.939" end="01:29:13.239" style="s2">yet we can find ourselves sitting and</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.109" end="01:29:15.489" style="s2">see if that is actually present then in</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.239" end="01:29:18.159" style="s2">that moment and if it is you will find</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.489" end="01:29:37.179" style="s2">that if we can release that desire for</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.159" end="01:29:40.779" style="s2">things to be other than they are but I</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.179" end="01:29:44.649" style="s2">found I was in a very pleasant state by</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.779" end="01:29:48.309" style="s2">the end of the first meditation period</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.649" end="01:29:50.679" style="s2">and then in the second one because I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.309" end="01:29:56.589" style="s2">been trying for what was coming next and</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.679" end="01:29:58.539" style="s2">I had a sense of life and I was like</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.589" end="01:30:01.059" style="s2">hoping to get back into that state but</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.539" end="01:30:03.459" style="s2">when I got back on the chair it was like</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.059" end="01:30:05.409" style="s2">yeah I would be 10 15 20 minutes to get</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.459" end="01:30:08.409" style="s2">back here and so there&#39;s like this this</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.409" end="01:30:12.399" style="s2">tension now I&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.409" end="01:30:15.279" style="s2">way of steam to release these real</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.399" end="01:30:17.349" style="s2">subtle expectations some things going is</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.279" end="01:30:21.099" style="s2">stirring away which seems to be a huge</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.349" end="01:30:21.879" style="s2">obstacle for me which is also good</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.099" end="01:30:23.859" style="s2">because it&#39;s workable</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.879" end="01:30:27.009" style="s2">it&#39;s like knowledgeable that I learned</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.859" end="01:30:28.239" style="s2">from having to continuously overcome but</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.009" end="01:30:32.499" style="s2">I&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s a way of seeing</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.239" end="01:30:34.839" style="s2">you might offer to kind of like let go</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.499" end="01:30:37.169" style="s2">of this level grabs me for like success</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.839" end="01:30:39.009" style="s2">I do actually</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.169" end="01:30:40.989" style="s2">this is what I&#39;ve been playing with</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.009" end="01:30:43.929" style="s2">recently I don&#39;t love it okay so this is</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.989" end="01:30:46.839" style="s2">not as far as I know they prescribed</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.929" end="01:30:50.559" style="s2">whatever seeing Buddha but nonetheless I</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.839" end="01:30:53.969" style="s2">find it very active so the way this one</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.559" end="01:30:53.969" style="s2">works you can you can do it right now</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.939" end="01:31:06.389" style="s2">and you ask yourself what is here if</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.249" end="01:31:06.389" style="s2">there is no problem</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.250" end="01:31:19.920" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.180" end="01:31:31.150" style="s2">do that again</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.920" end="01:31:34.410" style="s2">ask that question again so you know one</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.150" end="01:31:40.270" style="s2">of the functions of the mind is to</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.410" end="01:31:42.180" style="s2">create and discover the problems and so</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.270" end="01:31:44.920" style="s2">this kind of short circuits that</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.180" end="01:31:47.230" style="s2">tendency to be very good with</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.920" end="01:31:49.620" style="s2">expectations and things like that very</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.230" end="01:31:49.620" style="s2">helpful</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.640" end="01:32:09.460" style="s2">thank you I&#39;m sorry for being late I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.500" end="01:32:11.870" style="s2">injection means I have the paradox of I</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.460" end="01:32:16.700" style="s2">think I&#39;m hearing it here and other</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.870" end="01:32:19.880" style="s2">people&#39;s on the one hand we have the</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.700" end="01:32:21.920" style="s2">luxury of many techniques and ways of</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.880" end="01:32:25.250" style="s2">seeing and we have a profound</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.920" end="01:32:28.940" style="s2">appreciation as meditators if you change</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.250" end="01:32:32.900" style="s2">your mind you change the world as far as</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.940" end="01:32:38.740" style="s2">you see it and that&#39;s so powerful in</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.900" end="01:32:43.120" style="s2">itself around a little of slowing down</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.740" end="01:33:15.170" style="s2">into various freedom to choose</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.120" end="01:33:16.550" style="s2">perspective a new age churches and we</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.170" end="01:33:20.990" style="s2">weren&#39;t sure what was going on but he</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.550" end="01:33:24.290" style="s2">set up this semi golden and red tapestry</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.990" end="01:33:26.750" style="s2">in front of everybody and then he was</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.290" end="01:33:30.430" style="s2">welcomed by the community and started</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.750" end="01:33:30.430" style="s2">business he said</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.100" end="01:34:56.690" style="s2">we&#39;re going to see somebody which is now</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.220" end="01:35:00.260" style="s2">hanging in front of us is part of a</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.690" end="01:35:03.890" style="s2">worldwide meditation and it&#39;s a practice</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.260" end="01:35:07.190" style="s2">distance sent out amongst of people that</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.890" end="01:35:08.780" style="s2">if you teach people how to meditate in</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.190" end="01:35:10.490" style="s2">the simple way that instead of</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.780" end="01:35:12.100" style="s2">considering that your mind is somewhere</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.490" end="01:35:13.660" style="s2">in your body the world</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.100" end="01:35:16.810" style="s2">and you can choose perspectives with</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.660" end="01:35:22.420" style="s2">your mind that all of this bodies and</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.810" end="01:35:26.290" style="s2">things anything measurable is inside the</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.420" end="01:35:31.890" style="s2">mind the mind is not something inside</p>
<p begin="01:35:26.290" end="01:35:34.890" style="s2">the body and so he guided us into that</p>
<p begin="01:35:31.890" end="01:35:34.890" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.110" end="01:36:37.090" style="s2">the world will be completely well they</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.250" end="01:36:39.550" style="s2">said in the beginning that there came to</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.090" end="01:36:41.980" style="s2">be a desire to not have endless choices</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.550" end="01:36:45.700" style="s2">like how many hours do I need before I</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.980" end="01:36:47.620" style="s2">have too many and I love that one who</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.700" end="01:36:48.700" style="s2">can consolidate all these techniques</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.620" end="01:36:51.430" style="s2">into an over</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.700" end="01:37:02.290" style="s2">get going like get put feet on it and</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.430" end="01:37:04.930" style="s2">give it but the need to resolve the</p>
<p begin="01:37:02.290" end="01:37:11.740" style="s2">experimental mine without endless</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.930" end="01:37:13.870" style="s2">perspectives in so body was too much we</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.740" end="01:37:16.120" style="s2">mean I had heard too many kind of no</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.870" end="01:37:18.730" style="s2">self things like there is no place my</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.120" end="01:37:22.330" style="s2">favorite go on when I was growing there</p>
<p begin="01:37:18.730" end="01:37:31.720" style="s2">is no place to seek the mind it is like</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.330" end="01:37:34.420" style="s2">the footprints of the birds and so I</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.720" end="01:37:36.520" style="s2">love that there is a consolidation and</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.420" end="01:37:41.400" style="s2">an integration and a singularity point</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.520" end="01:37:44.350" style="s2">and that&#39;s part of Samadhi or xarna visa</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.400" end="01:37:46.300" style="s2">something&#39;s going on here that resolves</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.350" end="01:37:50.580" style="s2">the endless decision maker what</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.300" end="01:37:50.580" style="s2">technique is appropriate for this</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.710" end="01:37:57.560" style="s2">in this place I&#39;ve heard many here in</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.640" end="01:37:59.630" style="s2">this community talk about how I was</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.560" end="01:38:02.660" style="s2">fumbling through my techniques and I</p>
<p begin="01:37:59.630" end="01:38:10.480" style="s2">need to get one becomes humorous and</p>
<p begin="01:38:02.660" end="01:38:13.670" style="s2">that&#39;s great so the resolution of</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.480" end="01:38:17.030" style="s2">intentionality so that it can be</p>
<p begin="01:38:13.670" end="01:38:21.290" style="s2">creative bouncy playful and at the same</p>
<p begin="01:38:17.030" end="01:38:25.310" style="s2">time experience Samadhi active oneness</p>
<p begin="01:38:21.290" end="01:38:31.910" style="s2">with full diversity the free will of</p>
<p begin="01:38:25.310" end="01:38:35.840" style="s2">beings who could be no sellers but there</p>
<p begin="01:38:31.910" end="01:38:40.100" style="s2">instead of playing not just no suffering</p>
<p begin="01:38:35.840" end="01:38:43.390" style="s2">there play there created that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="01:38:40.100" end="01:38:48.380" style="s2">kind of wanted to you know somehow</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.390" end="01:38:52.250" style="s2">anyway I found it so that community that</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.380" end="01:38:54.650" style="s2">can actually articulate something beyond</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.250" end="01:38:55.280" style="s2">the mind by the attempt to coordinate</p>
<p begin="01:38:54.650" end="01:38:59.390" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="01:38:55.280" end="01:39:03.710" style="s2">I appreciate an honest attempt but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.390" end="01:39:06.560" style="s2">still looking for the community that</p>
<p begin="01:39:03.710" end="01:39:09.760" style="s2">embody I&#39;ve seen individuals actually in</p>
<p begin="01:39:06.560" end="01:39:09.760" style="s2">many stark communities</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.490" end="01:39:23.360" style="s2">but best in my confession there is no</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.040" end="01:39:37.960" style="s2">order it is hopefully I find offensive</p>
<p begin="01:39:23.360" end="01:39:45.760" style="s2">poem which I try to resolve its both</p>
<p begin="01:39:37.960" end="01:39:50.770" style="s2">contemplation and sketch on</p>
<p begin="01:39:45.760" end="01:39:57.170" style="s2">contemplations couch I once supposed</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.770" end="01:40:00.760" style="s2">that all thoughts the stand opposed have</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.170" end="01:40:03.260" style="s2">given their existence to each other as</p>

<p begin="01:40:03.260" end="01:40:16.040" style="s2">certainty as its mother so I sat midway</p>
<p begin="01:40:11.390" end="01:40:21.970" style="s2">between the two to take no sides I</p>
<p begin="01:40:16.040" end="01:40:26.660" style="s2">resolved to do then as long slight</p>

<p begin="01:42:41.910" end="01:42:47.130" style="s2">marketplace and for me that&#39;s very much</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.730" end="01:42:52.110" style="s2">at the heart of what I appreciate about</p>
<p begin="01:42:47.130" end="01:42:57.690" style="s2">this friend is that it helps us see that</p>
<p begin="01:42:52.110" end="01:43:00.870" style="s2">all of the various teachers and products</p>
<p begin="01:42:57.690" end="01:43:05.700" style="s2">in the marketplace are invitations to</p>
<p begin="01:43:00.870" end="01:43:06.390" style="s2">ways of seeing and inviting you to see</p>
<p begin="01:43:05.700" end="01:43:09.480" style="s2">things differently</p>
<p begin="01:43:06.390" end="01:43:12.470" style="s2">and to practice that kind of perceptual</p>
<p begin="01:43:09.480" end="01:43:15.930" style="s2">training but really they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="01:43:12.470" end="01:43:23.670" style="s2">equalized right it helps us sort of cut</p>
<p begin="01:43:15.930" end="01:43:25.770" style="s2">through the and sort of see</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.670" end="01:43:29.280" style="s2">what they&#39;re actually offering without</p>
<p begin="01:43:25.770" end="01:43:37.430" style="s2">being deluded by marketing essentially</p>
<p begin="01:43:29.280" end="01:43:37.430" style="s2">which is today&#39;s yeah I appreciate it</p>
<p begin="01:43:39.890" end="01:43:57.900" style="s2">yes I can see that you can&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:43:43.350" end="01:43:59.340" style="s2">leadership whatever what would you look</p>
<p begin="01:43:57.900" end="01:44:03.600" style="s2">at the different products in the</p>
<p begin="01:43:59.340" end="01:44:07.620" style="s2">marketplace and choose them as select</p>
<p begin="01:44:03.600" end="01:44:10.700" style="s2">them as ways of seeing isn&#39;t a way of</p>
<p begin="01:44:07.620" end="01:44:16.410" style="s2">seeing meeting before you even in mark</p>
<p begin="01:44:10.700" end="01:44:21.300" style="s2">and that way it sees itself a product in</p>
<p begin="01:44:16.410" end="01:44:24.000" style="s2">the marketplace yeah and to a certain</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.300" end="01:44:27.159" style="s2">degree it&#39;s like you you try something</p>
<p begin="01:44:24.000" end="01:44:30.370" style="s2">out you see how it goes for you</p>
<p begin="01:44:27.159" end="01:44:34.080" style="s2">and so the the thing that I it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:44:30.370" end="01:44:37.000" style="s2">important to say and kind of presence is</p>
<p begin="01:44:34.080" end="01:44:39.040" style="s2">this is what that&#39;s attempting to invite</p>
<p begin="01:44:37.000" end="01:44:43.030" style="s2">us to look at with the practice right</p>
<p begin="01:44:39.040" end="01:44:45.760" style="s2">it&#39;s like when you do this practice ease</p>
<p begin="01:44:43.030" end="01:44:48.429" style="s2">comes and you can trust that</p>
<p begin="01:44:45.760" end="01:44:52.449" style="s2">directionality but you can just keep</p>
<p begin="01:44:48.429" end="01:44:54.670" style="s2">moving in that direction the less that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:44:52.449" end="01:44:56.500" style="s2">more simplicity of releasing complexity</p>
<p begin="01:44:54.670" end="01:44:58.570" style="s2">and according to the Buddhist</p>
<p begin="01:44:56.500" end="01:45:01.600" style="s2">contemplatively Max and this is the only</p>
<p begin="01:44:58.570" end="01:45:03.880" style="s2">way to see what we&#39;re doing or the best</p>
<p begin="01:45:01.600" end="01:45:06.310" style="s2">way but it is I think what is being said</p>
<p begin="01:45:03.880" end="01:45:10.989" style="s2">here is that the directionality is</p>
<p begin="01:45:06.310" end="01:45:13.600" style="s2">towards less is tours no thingness right</p>
<p begin="01:45:10.989" end="01:45:17.230" style="s2">and so you can try different way they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:45:13.600" end="01:45:21.389" style="s2">seen but the proof is inputted right are</p>
<p begin="01:45:17.230" end="01:45:26.380" style="s2">they a doorway to less less suffering</p>
<p begin="01:45:21.389" end="01:45:30.429" style="s2">less in fact perception less complexity</p>
<p begin="01:45:26.380" end="01:45:32.260" style="s2">and so that becomes then the kind of way</p>
<p begin="01:45:30.429" end="01:45:34.060" style="s2">of seeing that helps you make sense out</p>
<p begin="01:45:32.260" end="01:45:36.310" style="s2">of the other ways of seeing right do</p>
<p begin="01:45:34.060" end="01:45:43.320" style="s2">they actually work to afford that</p>
<p begin="01:45:36.310" end="01:45:46.810" style="s2">reduction attraction or meditating</p>
<p begin="01:45:43.320" end="01:46:01.780" style="s2">suffering if we&#39;re open towards less</p>
<p begin="01:45:46.810" end="01:46:04.810" style="s2">close but it seems to be you know is</p>
<p begin="01:46:01.780" end="01:46:08.110" style="s2">scientific phenomenology of</p>
<p begin="01:46:04.810" end="01:46:10.900" style="s2">consciousness it&#39;s not an infinite</p>
<p begin="01:46:08.110" end="01:46:13.929" style="s2">regress about coming from some sort of</p>
<p begin="01:46:10.900" end="01:46:16.960" style="s2">mindset I can&#39;t get out of the</p>
<p begin="01:46:13.929" end="01:46:17.860" style="s2">conditioned mind it&#39;s that the open bar</p>
<p begin="01:46:16.960" end="01:46:22.360" style="s2">is already</p>
<p begin="01:46:17.860" end="01:46:26.860" style="s2">yeah and anything he looks at tends to</p>
<p begin="01:46:22.360" end="01:46:33.150" style="s2">give up its idealism oh I am the best</p>
<p begin="01:46:26.860" end="01:46:36.900" style="s2">idea you know there is no best excessive</p>
<p begin="01:46:33.150" end="01:46:41.020" style="s2">pure conscious won&#39;t be this well</p>
<p begin="01:46:36.900" end="01:46:44.740" style="s2">devotion that is not conditional that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:46:41.020" end="01:46:51.280" style="s2">not that this but we came twelve it out</p>
<p begin="01:46:44.740" end="01:46:54.910" style="s2">or you can experience and fails to the</p>
<p begin="01:46:51.280" end="01:46:59.650" style="s2">other it&#39;s not an idea right it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:46:54.910" end="01:47:01.720" style="s2">experiential proof now the patient by</p>
<p begin="01:46:59.650" end="01:47:04.300" style="s2">the Buddha your your lamp unto yourself</p>
<p begin="01:47:01.720" end="01:47:08.260" style="s2">and if you can&#39;t get confidence in the</p>
<p begin="01:47:04.300" end="01:47:13.300" style="s2">practice some sky pockets when you get</p>
<p begin="01:47:08.260" end="01:47:18.160" style="s2">it if you can&#39;t in yourself know what is</p>
<p begin="01:47:13.300" end="01:47:20.520" style="s2">true by your own honesty how will</p>
<p begin="01:47:18.160" end="01:47:20.520" style="s2">anybody</p>
<p begin="01:47:30.820" end="01:47:41.410" style="s2">so I came here having many have you been</p>
<p begin="01:47:37.430" end="01:47:45.530" style="s2">trained in a few spiritual practices</p>
<p begin="01:47:41.410" end="01:47:49.219" style="s2">Native American spirituality science</p>
<p begin="01:47:45.530" end="01:47:52.100" style="s2">mind and cousin immunity you know you</p>
<p begin="01:47:49.219" end="01:47:55.790" style="s2">doing Native American spirituality at</p>
<p begin="01:47:52.100" end="01:48:00.199" style="s2">the monastery in some in a variety of</p>
<p begin="01:47:55.790" end="01:48:06.469" style="s2">ways and Shin said we&#39;re up in the</p>
<p begin="01:48:00.199" end="01:48:08.449" style="s2">Church of religious science so and I put</p>
<p begin="01:48:06.469" end="01:48:10.460" style="s2">a lot of effort into those as much</p>
<p begin="01:48:08.449" end="01:48:15.290" style="s2">effort as you seen me put in here</p>
<p begin="01:48:10.460" end="01:48:17.680" style="s2">because I wanted I needed to find a</p>
<p begin="01:48:15.290" end="01:48:21.680" style="s2">spiritual path that worked for me</p>
<p begin="01:48:17.680" end="01:48:22.130" style="s2">primarily to reduce suffering I consider</p>
<p begin="01:48:21.680" end="01:48:28.340" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:48:22.130" end="01:48:32.440" style="s2">I meditate because it&#39;s healing and so I</p>
<p begin="01:48:28.340" end="01:48:36.020" style="s2">come here and you&#39;re right everything is</p>
<p begin="01:48:32.440" end="01:48:38.210" style="s2">just brought down it&#39;s more much more</p>
<p begin="01:48:36.020" end="01:48:40.370" style="s2">elemental Native American spiritual is</p>
<p begin="01:48:38.210" end="01:48:42.920" style="s2">perfectly infinite in the things that</p>
<p begin="01:48:40.370" end="01:48:46.520" style="s2">you can do there and science of mind is</p>
<p begin="01:48:42.920" end="01:48:50.750" style="s2">also very infinite and I found when I</p>
<p begin="01:48:46.520" end="01:48:53.270" style="s2">came here in December of 2012 as I hey</p>
<p begin="01:48:50.750" end="01:48:58.040" style="s2">it happened to me right away I had</p>
<p begin="01:48:53.270" end="01:49:02.330" style="s2">gotten so far out into this huge</p>
<p begin="01:48:58.040" end="01:49:06.110" style="s2">universal mind that I was completely</p>
<p begin="01:49:02.330" end="01:49:11.230" style="s2">lost and came here and I sat here one</p>
<p begin="01:49:06.110" end="01:49:11.230" style="s2">time and sorry you just packed me</p>
<p begin="01:49:15.699" end="01:49:22.849" style="s2">Thanks I&#39;m here</p>
<p begin="01:49:18.050" end="01:49:26.230" style="s2">and so I that&#39;s what I appreciate about</p>
<p begin="01:49:22.849" end="01:49:28.730" style="s2">the practice is and I was thinking of</p>
<p begin="01:49:26.230" end="01:49:32.599" style="s2">Jeffrey said and I believe you said it</p>
<p begin="01:49:28.730" end="01:49:35.630" style="s2">in your talk - I was thinking about is</p>
<p begin="01:49:32.599" end="01:49:39.110" style="s2">it it&#39;s not really faith like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:49:35.630" end="01:49:42.050" style="s2">have faith in the practice mm-hmm but I</p>
<p begin="01:49:39.110" end="01:49:47.329" style="s2">trust the practice because I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:49:42.050" end="01:49:49.610" style="s2">experienced that it works so even on a</p>
<p begin="01:49:47.329" end="01:49:51.500" style="s2">night like tonight where I&#39;m good I</p>
<p begin="01:49:49.610" end="01:49:55.210" style="s2">never say myself I have a good practice</p>
<p begin="01:49:51.500" end="01:49:57.590" style="s2">or a bad practice tonight I was not I</p>
<p begin="01:49:55.210" end="01:50:00.290" style="s2">didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t do a very good job for</p>
<p begin="01:49:57.590" end="01:50:04.010" style="s2">myself I&#39;m very distracted by something</p>
<p begin="01:50:00.290" end="01:50:06.739" style="s2">else and I think Jeffrey said it in his</p>
<p begin="01:50:04.010" end="01:50:09.980" style="s2">poem because when I walk out that door</p>
<p begin="01:50:06.739" end="01:50:13.210" style="s2">tonight and look up into the sky or</p>
<p begin="01:50:09.980" end="01:50:17.770" style="s2">whatever&#39;s going on out there in nature</p>
<p begin="01:50:13.210" end="01:50:21.770" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna be fine because I trust that</p>
<p begin="01:50:17.770" end="01:50:25.670" style="s2">and then we&#39;ll gradually be able to</p>
<p begin="01:50:21.770" end="01:50:28.630" style="s2">break myself back to the practice I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:50:25.670" end="01:50:34.190" style="s2">probably think this a bunch more tonight</p>
<p begin="01:50:28.630" end="01:50:36.920" style="s2">you know and so that&#39;s what I appreciate</p>
<p begin="01:50:34.190" end="01:50:41.900" style="s2">in Canada practice in the weather we how</p>
<p begin="01:50:36.920" end="01:50:46.210" style="s2">we describe suffering or this fairly</p>
<p begin="01:50:41.900" end="01:50:51.260" style="s2">complicated concept of impermanence or</p>
<p begin="01:50:46.210" end="01:50:57.060" style="s2">attachment more complicated there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:50:51.260" end="01:51:00.930" style="s2">still very precise and very doable</p>
<p begin="01:50:57.060" end="01:51:05.190" style="s2">then I have I have up trust in the</p>
<p begin="01:51:00.930" end="01:51:06.690" style="s2">practice so I do appreciate sitting in</p>
<p begin="01:51:05.190" end="01:51:13.470" style="s2">this room sorry don&#39;t have a deep</p>
<p begin="01:51:06.690" end="01:51:16.800" style="s2">question but I just really enjoy the</p>
<p begin="01:51:13.470" end="01:51:24.270" style="s2">order of things there&#39;s three there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:51:16.800" end="01:51:26.850" style="s2">four doozy thank you for sharing that</p>
<p begin="01:51:24.270" end="01:51:27.900" style="s2">what comes up for me was one of the</p>
<p begin="01:51:26.850" end="01:51:30.780" style="s2">things I really liked about this</p>
<p begin="01:51:27.900" end="01:51:32.700" style="s2">approach too is that it enables a level</p>
<p begin="01:51:30.780" end="01:51:36.180" style="s2">of like creativity and autonomy if I</p>
<p begin="01:51:32.700" end="01:51:37.710" style="s2">practice and so the first year that we</p>
<p begin="01:51:36.180" end="01:51:40.350" style="s2">offered a Vision Quest at the monastery</p>
<p begin="01:51:37.710" end="01:51:43.050" style="s2">I did the Vision Quest and that&#39;s big</p>
<p begin="01:51:40.350" end="01:51:44.160" style="s2">leaders like sit in a cordon off piece</p>
<p begin="01:51:43.050" end="01:51:52.730" style="s2">of the Woods would just sort of like</p>
<p begin="01:51:44.160" end="01:52:03.870" style="s2">hang out for three days we do in this</p>
<p begin="01:51:52.730" end="01:52:07.260" style="s2">container here good luck being there and</p>
<p begin="01:52:03.870" end="01:52:10.710" style="s2">looking out into the woods and there was</p>
<p begin="01:52:07.260" end="01:52:14.220" style="s2">a particular way of seeing that started</p>
<p begin="01:52:10.710" end="01:52:17.220" style="s2">to emerge right but I was this way of</p>
<p begin="01:52:14.220" end="01:52:19.440" style="s2">being with the natural world I had never</p>
<p begin="01:52:17.220" end="01:52:22.350" style="s2">experienced before in my life</p>
<p begin="01:52:19.440" end="01:52:27.810" style="s2">it was beautiful it was wondrous it was</p>
<p begin="01:52:22.350" end="01:52:30.750" style="s2">really relaxing and what I can now do is</p>
<p begin="01:52:27.810" end="01:52:33.360" style="s2">recall that way it seemed and sort of</p>
<p begin="01:52:30.750" end="01:52:35.850" style="s2">turn it around on to my experience and</p>
<p begin="01:52:33.360" end="01:52:39.420" style="s2">adopted them as the way I&#39;ve seen right</p>
<p begin="01:52:35.850" end="01:52:41.430" style="s2">that I can just like call up and just as</p>
<p begin="01:52:39.420" end="01:52:45.360" style="s2">when you like participating look at the</p>
<p begin="01:52:41.430" end="01:52:47.250" style="s2">sky right you can kind of do that same</p>
<p begin="01:52:45.360" end="01:52:52.800" style="s2">thing we can understand that as a way of</p>
