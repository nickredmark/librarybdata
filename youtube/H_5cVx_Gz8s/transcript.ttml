<p begin="00:11:33.209" end="00:11:37.140" style="s2">the different people participating in</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.220" end="00:11:39.630" style="s2">today&#39;s conversation are going to</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.140" end="00:11:42.930" style="s2">interpret the same content that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.630" end="00:11:45.029" style="s2">all going to be hearing about and and</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.930" end="00:11:46.800" style="s2">taking away differently but which</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.029" end="00:11:49.860" style="s2">similarities are going to stick around</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.800" end="00:11:52.230" style="s2">and I wonder if there&#39;s any consistency</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.860" end="00:11:54.930" style="s2">to the function that those similarities</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.230" end="00:11:57.420" style="s2">are going to play out when they start</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.930" end="00:12:02.850" style="s2">getting embedded into the institutions</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.420" end="00:12:04.529" style="s2">that each of us play a role in yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.850" end="00:12:09.600" style="s2">roughly that&#39;s what I&#39;m thinking and</p>

<p begin="00:12:09.600" end="00:12:17.880" style="s2">and the question that I am thinking</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.339" end="00:12:19.860" style="s2">about is how our philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.880" end="00:12:23.569" style="s2">relationship to time for how our</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.860" end="00:12:25.560" style="s2">relationships time and shift can change</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.569" end="00:12:29.449" style="s2">so looking forward to hearing what this</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.560" end="00:12:29.449" style="s2">conversation is about</p>

<p begin="00:12:51.550" end="00:12:58.660" style="s2">Tim&#39;s question so I wanted to chime in</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.279" end="00:13:00.520" style="s2">there and I wanted to say that I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.660" end="00:13:06.839" style="s2">what I am alive to in this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.520" end="00:13:09.700" style="s2">is whether these psycho technologies are</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.839" end="00:13:12.700" style="s2">giving us access to something real that</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.700" end="00:13:16.390" style="s2">we didn&#39;t have access to before and how</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.700" end="00:13:21.040" style="s2">that works in a sort of performative or</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.390" end="00:13:30.480" style="s2">uncovering ontology I&#39;ll tag whoever&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.040" end="00:13:34.339" style="s2">world hasn&#39;t gone after me has anyone</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.480" end="00:13:36.120" style="s2">not gone yet</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.339" end="00:13:37.890" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.120" end="00:13:45.990" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.890" end="00:13:48.319" style="s2">I think everyone&#39;s okay so can everyone</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.990" end="00:13:52.819" style="s2">hear me thumbs up</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.319" end="00:13:55.910" style="s2">yeah okay and so two things first of all</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.819" end="00:13:58.879" style="s2">this is going to be an experiment an</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.910" end="00:14:00.649" style="s2">experiential experiment and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.879" end="00:14:04.489" style="s2">some of the questions that are a little</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.649" end="00:14:07.789" style="s2">more theoretical nature may not be</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.489" end="00:14:10.759" style="s2">answered during the session therefore if</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.789" end="00:14:12.669" style="s2">you have those sorts of questions feel</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.759" end="00:14:17.329" style="s2">free to email me and I&#39;m sure that Peter</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.669" end="00:14:18.499" style="s2">will include my website and the show</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.329" end="00:14:20.749" style="s2">notes or somewhere else</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.499" end="00:14:23.470" style="s2">so that&#39;s the first thing the second</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.749" end="00:14:28.220" style="s2">thing is that we&#39;re about to embark on a</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.470" end="00:14:29.629" style="s2">short guided meditation and so the first</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.220" end="00:14:34.249" style="s2">thing to do would be to turn off your</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.629" end="00:14:38.989" style="s2">cameras I&#39;ll leave mine on everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.249" end="00:14:41.839" style="s2">can turn off cameras beautiful and also</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.989" end="00:14:49.459" style="s2">mute your microphone if you haven&#39;t done</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.839" end="00:14:51.259" style="s2">so yet okay next you might want to find</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.459" end="00:14:54.529" style="s2">a comfortable place if you&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.259" end="00:14:57.829" style="s2">seated position that&#39;s fine if you feel</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.529" end="00:14:59.749" style="s2">called to lie on the floor provided that</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.829" end="00:15:05.239" style="s2">it&#39;s somewhat energetic that would be</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.749" end="00:15:07.489" style="s2">fine too you might want to take off your</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.239" end="00:15:12.019" style="s2">glasses since that can be a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.489" end="00:15:15.679" style="s2">hindrance if you&#39;re wearing glasses in</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.019" end="00:15:17.539" style="s2">what follows it would be lovely to see</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.679" end="00:15:19.999" style="s2">whether you&#39;re able to go along with the</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.539" end="00:15:22.789" style="s2">meditation and if you can that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.999" end="00:15:25.100" style="s2">wonderful if however you find that you</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.789" end="00:15:26.869" style="s2">can&#39;t go along with the meditation that</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.100" end="00:15:29.329" style="s2">is that there&#39;s some kind of resistance</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.869" end="00:15:32.089" style="s2">within you then perhaps your meditation</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.329" end="00:15:35.600" style="s2">could be beginning to examine the</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.089" end="00:15:40.009" style="s2">resistance what is the resistance where</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.600" end="00:15:44.059" style="s2">is it does it have a shape or a size or</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.009" end="00:15:46.970" style="s2">tone and and that can be a meditation</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.059" end="00:15:50.019" style="s2">during the guided meditation or during</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.970" end="00:15:53.499" style="s2">the the next section which is our group</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.019" end="00:15:53.499" style="s2">meditative discourse</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.050" end="00:16:04.350" style="s2">okay let&#39;s begin you may want to keep</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.100" end="00:16:08.700" style="s2">your eyes open or you can close them</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.350" end="00:16:10.050" style="s2">either is fine you might find that</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.700" end="00:16:21.380" style="s2">there&#39;s a bit more energy if you have</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.050" end="00:16:21.380" style="s2">your eyes closed begin with your head</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.840" end="00:16:31.010" style="s2">imagine or visualize or sense or feel</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.680" end="00:16:33.800" style="s2">that you&#39;re installing energy all the</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.010" end="00:16:38.870" style="s2">way through your head from the crown of</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.800" end="00:16:47.480" style="s2">the head all the way down to the jaw all</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.870" end="00:16:51.200" style="s2">of that will be nothing but energy then</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.480" end="00:16:55.030" style="s2">begin to install energy in your neck so</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.200" end="00:17:01.570" style="s2">that your neck is just energy entirely</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.030" end="00:17:01.570" style="s2">filled with and nothing but energy</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.300" end="00:17:10.490" style="s2">do the same for your left arm imagine</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.760" end="00:17:13.470" style="s2">the entire left arm is nothing more than</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.490" end="00:17:16.050" style="s2">nothing other than nothing less than</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.470" end="00:17:18.720" style="s2">energy and therefore it is entirely</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.050" end="00:17:21.630" style="s2">filled up with energy from the shoulder</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.720" end="00:17:25.680" style="s2">joint all the way down to the tips of</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.630" end="00:17:27.840" style="s2">the fingers and then do the same for</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.680" end="00:17:31.860" style="s2">your right hand you can feel that your</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.840" end="00:17:34.310" style="s2">right arm rather is entirely filled with</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.860" end="00:17:34.310" style="s2">energy</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.090" end="00:17:50.240" style="s2">now turn to your trunk the long trunk</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.150" end="00:17:53.540" style="s2">imagine or sense or visualize or feel</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.240" end="00:17:56.510" style="s2">that you&#39;re installing energy from your</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.540" end="00:18:00.650" style="s2">clavicle all the way down to the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.510" end="00:18:05.390" style="s2">of your trunk that includes your heart</p>

<p begin="00:18:12.380" end="00:18:15.280" style="s2">energy</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.890" end="00:18:30.820" style="s2">then take your genitals and your butt</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.549" end="00:18:40.490" style="s2">and all that and see it as entirely</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.820" end="00:18:44.980" style="s2">energy and now the right leg take the</p>

<p begin="00:18:44.980" end="00:18:53.420" style="s2">down to the foot and install energy</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.340" end="00:18:56.809" style="s2">there so that the right leg is nothing</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.420" end="00:19:00.140" style="s2">more than nothing less than and nothing</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.809" end="00:19:04.770" style="s2">other than energy nothing but pulsing</p>

<p begin="00:19:04.770" end="00:19:14.120" style="s2">and now do the same thing for your left</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.220" end="00:19:16.530" style="s2">leg allow energy to be installed</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.120" end="00:19:20.750" style="s2">throughout the course of your left leg</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.530" end="00:19:24.049" style="s2">all the way to your foot</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.750" end="00:19:28.030" style="s2">so that it is nothing more than less</p>

<p begin="00:19:40.690" end="00:19:48.940" style="s2">and now imagine that there is some kind</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.900" end="00:19:53.920" style="s2">of brush going up and down your body</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.940" end="00:19:57.410" style="s2">such that the brush is moving energy</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.920" end="00:20:01.040" style="s2">from the bottom of your feet to the top</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.410" end="00:20:05.210" style="s2">or crown of your head and back when you</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.040" end="00:20:08.630" style="s2">inhale the energy can be regarded as</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.210" end="00:20:11.600" style="s2">going up from the feet through the</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.630" end="00:20:15.740" style="s2">middle of the body all the way to the</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.600" end="00:20:20.710" style="s2">crown every inhalation the energy flows</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.740" end="00:20:24.980" style="s2">as it were upward every exhalation</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.710" end="00:20:27.940" style="s2">allows the energy to float downward one</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.980" end="00:20:32.630" style="s2">beautiful brushstroke after the other</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.940" end="00:20:41.800" style="s2">the whole body is brushed upward and</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.630" end="00:20:48.340" style="s2">downward breathe in brushstroke comes up</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.800" end="00:20:48.340" style="s2">you breathe down brushstroke goes down</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.610" end="00:20:55.850" style="s2">you might find your body just slightly</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.650" end="00:21:00.280" style="s2">rocking a little bit in concert with the</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.850" end="00:21:00.280" style="s2">inhalation and the exhalation</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.750" end="00:21:08.900" style="s2">and throughout you&#39;ll just feel the</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.530" end="00:21:08.900" style="s2">energy flowing upward and downward</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.020" end="00:21:18.080" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.040" end="00:21:35.040" style="s2">and now since that the energy is coming</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.880" end="00:21:35.040" style="s2">just out of your body</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.120" end="00:21:41.710" style="s2">the front and back into the body so that</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.110" end="00:21:44.710" style="s2">it begins to seem as if the skin is</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.710" end="00:21:44.710" style="s2">permeable</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.290" end="00:21:50.830" style="s2">the inn</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.340" end="00:21:54.010" style="s2">brings energy just outside the body the</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.830" end="00:21:56.230" style="s2">exhalation brings the body into the pot</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.010" end="00:22:00.840" style="s2">I&#39;m sorry brings the energy into the</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.230" end="00:22:04.390" style="s2">body exhalation energy goes out</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.840" end="00:22:06.550" style="s2">inhalation energy comes in it might also</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.390" end="00:22:10.390" style="s2">feel a little bit like a rocking</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.550" end="00:22:17.470" style="s2">experience or like a brush stroke back</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.390" end="00:22:20.640" style="s2">and forth back and forth in and out and</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.470" end="00:22:20.640" style="s2">so on</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.090" end="00:22:25.150" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.929" end="00:22:27.990" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.860" end="00:22:43.920" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.850" end="00:22:58.190" style="s2">and now imagine or feel or sense that</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.050" end="00:23:00.860" style="s2">the energy from within you is being</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.190" end="00:23:04.490" style="s2">carried farther and farther away from</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.860" end="00:23:08.210" style="s2">you that is that the energy is expanding</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.490" end="00:23:10.220" style="s2">into the space nearby</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.210" end="00:23:14.560" style="s2">and then is going farther than the space</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.220" end="00:23:19.180" style="s2">nearby to the farthest possible</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.560" end="00:23:21.290" style="s2">conceivable or imaginable space and</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.180" end="00:23:24.860" style="s2">therefore the energy is doing nothing</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.290" end="00:23:29.900" style="s2">but expanding beyond the bounds of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.860" end="00:23:32.470" style="s2">skin as far as the mind can imagine or</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.900" end="00:23:32.470" style="s2">conceive of</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.170" end="00:23:38.650" style="s2">it is nothing but expansion</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.879" end="00:23:45.940" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.780" end="00:23:56.780" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.720" end="00:23:56.780" style="s2">you</p>

<p begin="00:24:02.580" end="00:24:04.640" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.830" end="00:24:13.570" style="s2">throughout this meditation for many of</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.540" end="00:24:17.410" style="s2">us there has been a witness or an</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.570" end="00:24:21.370" style="s2">observer or an aware or the one that</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.410" end="00:24:25.030" style="s2">seems to be doing all this therefore we</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.370" end="00:24:28.450" style="s2">can now install energy in via wearer or</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.030" end="00:24:30.370" style="s2">the observer or the witness the one</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.450" end="00:24:32.850" style="s2">that&#39;s been as it were standing behind</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.370" end="00:24:36.150" style="s2">all of this</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.850" end="00:24:41.700" style="s2">therefore install energy in the aware or</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.150" end="00:24:45.420" style="s2">in you so that you are nothing but</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.700" end="00:24:53.780" style="s2">energy in fact do not install energy in</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.420" end="00:24:53.780" style="s2">the aware rather be the energy itself</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.510" end="00:25:00.249" style="s2">anytime some</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.159" end="00:25:03.999" style="s2">tries to stand back from the process of</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.249" end="00:25:08.229" style="s2">installation see that you too cannot</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.999" end="00:25:11.080" style="s2">stand back from being installed with C</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.229" end="00:25:14.669" style="s2">fused with and therefore entirely filled</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.080" end="00:25:14.669" style="s2">up with energy</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.230" end="00:25:20.290" style="s2">you</p>

<p begin="00:25:41.330" end="00:25:49.050" style="s2">therefore energy is everywhere and</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.540" end="00:25:53.190" style="s2">perhaps it could also be said know where</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.050" end="00:25:56.870" style="s2">in particular therefore there is no</p>

<p begin="00:25:57.330" end="00:26:01.669" style="s2">no above or below</p>

<p begin="00:26:06.900" end="00:26:12.680" style="s2">everything is energy</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.380" end="00:26:17.410" style="s2">and if</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.680" end="00:26:17.410" style="s2">there is no thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.700" end="00:26:28.060" style="s2">rather all processes are energetic</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.800" end="00:26:29.950" style="s2">everything is vibrating</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.060" end="00:26:32.320" style="s2">everything which is no thing in</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.950" end="00:26:39.470" style="s2">particular because no substance in</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.320" end="00:26:44.320" style="s2">particular is is just vibrating</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.470" end="00:26:44.320" style="s2">pulsating energy</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.740" end="00:26:48.700" style="s2">you</p>

<p begin="00:27:00.830" end="00:27:05.980" style="s2">and now ask yourself a question</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.520" end="00:27:17.290" style="s2">and allow that question to fill you all</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.660" end="00:27:19.590" style="s2">up with the sense of mystery do not try</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.290" end="00:27:24.490" style="s2">to answer the question intellectually</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.590" end="00:27:27.120" style="s2">just ask the question and see where it</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.490" end="00:27:27.120" style="s2">takes you</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.179" end="00:27:33.589" style="s2">ask yourself the question Who am I</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.179" end="00:27:41.139" style="s2">ask yourself Who am I</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.980" end="00:27:51.900" style="s2">Who am I</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.840" end="00:27:51.900" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.539" end="00:28:01.849" style="s2">ask yourself where am I</p>

<p begin="00:28:15.230" end="00:28:19.899" style="s2">could I be there</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.530" end="00:28:31.090" style="s2">is there any sense to be made of here or</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.090" end="00:28:31.090" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.680" end="00:28:38.520" style="s2">am i in space at all</p>

<p begin="00:28:49.540" end="00:28:58.000" style="s2">ask yourself the question when am I</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.830" end="00:29:07.460" style="s2">MIB for</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.460" end="00:29:12.330" style="s2">could I be after</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.440" end="00:29:31.370" style="s2">can I make any sense</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.440" end="00:29:38.750" style="s2">of talk of before or after or am I only</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.370" end="00:29:38.750" style="s2">ever always now</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.010" end="00:30:00.780" style="s2">ask yourself what am i what what am I</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.690" end="00:30:09.510" style="s2">but even that is too much because it</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.630" end="00:30:13.790" style="s2">assumes that there&#39;s a what different</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.510" end="00:30:13.790" style="s2">from and separate from I</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.600" end="00:30:24.159" style="s2">so ask yourself am i I</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.650" end="00:30:30.780" style="s2">em aye aye</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.210" end="00:30:39.140" style="s2">you</p>

<p begin="00:30:39.980" end="00:30:48.710" style="s2">but even that is saying too much</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.760" end="00:30:48.710" style="s2">therefore ask yourself simply</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.919" end="00:30:51.919" style="s2">mysteriously</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.940" end="00:30:53.970" style="s2">I</p>

<p begin="00:31:28.900" end="00:31:36.920" style="s2">therefore sink</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.990" end="00:31:36.920" style="s2">and rest</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.300" end="00:31:42.760" style="s2">sink and rest</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.160" end="00:31:47.710" style="s2">in the nameless</p>

<p begin="00:33:14.620" end="00:33:26.870" style="s2">slowly open your eyes but while you do</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.990" end="00:33:31.669" style="s2">so try to don&#39;t even try to allow</p>

<p begin="00:34:06.530" end="00:34:14.350" style="s2">and you can slowly turn your video</p>

<p begin="00:35:32.560" end="00:35:41.110" style="s2">have our cameras back on and so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.370" end="00:35:43.450" style="s2">come to the we space meditative</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.110" end="00:35:47.490" style="s2">discourse at a we skate we space</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.450" end="00:35:50.680" style="s2">discursive meditation or part two and</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.490" end="00:35:53.800" style="s2">here let me just suggest that the place</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.680" end="00:35:56.700" style="s2">we found if I may you give a name to it</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.800" end="00:35:59.200" style="s2">for the moment could be called the heart</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.700" end="00:36:01.810" style="s2">I&#39;m just using that provisionally if</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.200" end="00:36:04.840" style="s2">you&#39;re not inclined to that term then</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.810" end="00:36:07.870" style="s2">you can just let it go but the point of</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.840" end="00:36:11.500" style="s2">the second part then is to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.870" end="00:36:15.010" style="s2">speak from this place if you feel</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.500" end="00:36:17.830" style="s2">stirred to speak if you feel no stirring</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.010" end="00:36:20.370" style="s2">to speak then you can just keep sinking</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.830" end="00:36:23.770" style="s2">into this particular place &#39;less place</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.370" end="00:36:30.780" style="s2">this kind of silence the silence before</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.770" end="00:36:32.890" style="s2">speech and if you feel that anything is</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.780" end="00:36:34.840" style="s2">bothering you there&#39;s any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.890" end="00:36:37.570" style="s2">resistance then take that as your point</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.840" end="00:36:40.750" style="s2">of departure just ask yourself what is</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.570" end="00:36:43.700" style="s2">it that is that which I&#39;m resisting and</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.750" end="00:36:45.650" style="s2">you can go into that</p>

<p begin="00:39:36.770" end="00:39:43.290" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense when I was doing that</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.770" end="00:39:45.840" style="s2">meditation where I just felt transparent</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.290" end="00:39:48.480" style="s2">and visible see-through but at the same</p>

<p begin="00:40:06.249" end="00:40:17.019" style="s2">they were almost the same thing in that</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.209" end="00:40:21.729" style="s2">kind of found that those is energy that</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.019" end="00:40:25.539" style="s2">we kind of only are energy and that sort</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.729" end="00:40:27.489" style="s2">of interacts with the world and in a</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.539" end="00:40:30.519" style="s2">weird way if she sort of close your eyes</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.489" end="00:40:33.039" style="s2">and imagine where the energy is that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.519" end="00:40:37.679" style="s2">also who you are it&#39;s a bit hard to</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.039" end="00:40:37.679" style="s2">explain but I got a strong sense of that</p>

<p begin="00:41:34.229" end="00:41:41.459" style="s2">it really hit me at the right time and</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.019" end="00:41:45.089" style="s2">I&#39;m wondering what the experience is</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.459" end="00:41:48.799" style="s2">like for you kind of pulling people to</p>

<p begin="00:41:48.799" end="00:41:57.390" style="s2">themselves what does that experience</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.569" end="00:41:59.640" style="s2">like is it finally caution us against</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.390" end="00:42:00.989" style="s2">not against not really caution us</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.640" end="00:42:05.219" style="s2">against but you kind of remind us that</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.989" end="00:42:07.170" style="s2">there will be resistances and I think</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.219" end="00:42:09.479" style="s2">that&#39;s helpful but I&#39;m wondering what</p>

<p begin="00:48:29.030" end="00:48:37.940" style="s2">hurt or annoyance or subtle anger but I</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.359" end="00:48:41.060" style="s2">like with Tim was saying is that or how</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.940" end="00:48:43.760" style="s2">I how I read that it&#39;s like that itself</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.060" end="00:48:47.410" style="s2">is sort of an art form to maintain that</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.760" end="00:48:50.119" style="s2">invitation that had that availability of</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.410" end="00:48:52.070" style="s2">available that stayed available I should</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.119" end="00:48:56.230" style="s2">say when the other person can&#39;t receive</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.070" end="00:48:56.230" style="s2">it or it&#39;s not ready to receive it</p>

<p begin="00:49:14.739" end="00:49:27.099" style="s2">mind is maybe we can take a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.989" end="00:49:29.529" style="s2">with a relative I can consider certain</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.099" end="00:49:32.019" style="s2">experiences of my life the people that</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.529" end="00:49:36.369" style="s2">have a loving relationship with that as</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.019" end="00:49:39.099" style="s2">paned of a sense in which there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:49:43.289" end="00:49:55.140" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense of of holding the</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.829" end="00:49:59.319" style="s2">boundary of that as in this rejection is</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.140" end="00:50:03.969" style="s2">real there&#39;s something here that is not</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.319" end="00:50:05.979" style="s2">being seen and accepted and that is that</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.969" end="00:50:10.329" style="s2">is part of this relationship that is</p>

<p begin="00:50:10.329" end="00:50:17.410" style="s2">painful to both of us yet at the same</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.170" end="00:50:20.079" style="s2">time work through that looking into the</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.410" end="00:50:22.869" style="s2">eyes there&#39;s there&#39;s something behind it</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.079" end="00:50:24.369" style="s2">there&#39;s that there&#39;s a deeper love it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:50:24.369" end="00:50:28.569" style="s2">maybe there&#39;s some egoic block or</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.739" end="00:50:30.369" style="s2">however we might want to however we</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.569" end="00:50:32.349" style="s2">might want to put that as something</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.369" end="00:50:34.930" style="s2">compromised in the map it&#39;s like no I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.349" end="00:50:36.579" style="s2">holding on to my map of this you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.930" end="00:50:40.180" style="s2">and there&#39;s pain there but then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.579" end="00:50:44.369" style="s2">a deeper sense of actually in the end</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.180" end="00:50:49.089" style="s2">really we&#39;re still in this together and</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.369" end="00:50:52.569" style="s2">so to hold to that and to presence that</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.089" end="00:50:56.130" style="s2">has that state of nothingness in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.569" end="00:51:00.009" style="s2">here and now of this ripe potentiality</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.130" end="00:51:03.039" style="s2">lasts on how we are still involved in</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.009" end="00:51:05.109" style="s2">and there&#39;s a deep sense of caring</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.039" end="00:51:09.130" style="s2">somehow in that that&#39;s that&#39;s beyond</p>

<p begin="00:51:27.860" end="00:51:34.020" style="s2">accepted that actually we are still in</p>

<p begin="00:51:34.020" end="00:51:36.680" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.040" end="00:51:52.100" style="s2">my Tim I resonated a a lot with what you</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.100" end="00:51:54.250" style="s2">just said it feels to me like the</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.100" end="00:51:56.390" style="s2">conforms appear out of emptiness there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.250" end="00:51:57.860" style="s2">places where different forms will be</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.390" end="00:51:59.540" style="s2">connected to each other in places they</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.860" end="00:52:00.920" style="s2">won&#39;t and it sounds so simple when I put</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.540" end="00:52:04.210" style="s2">it that way but of course if we were the</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.920" end="00:52:07.270" style="s2">forms and we&#39;re emotional beings and we</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.210" end="00:52:10.100" style="s2">have these momentous experiences and</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.270" end="00:52:13.940" style="s2">mentis desires really that you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.100" end="00:52:17.120" style="s2">even expect and they they get denied to</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.940" end="00:52:18.620" style="s2">us in ways we didn&#39;t expect and can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.120" end="00:52:21.020" style="s2">make and can&#39;t comprehend and don&#39;t have</p>

<p begin="00:52:23.360" end="00:52:31.510" style="s2">are that we need to explore in order to</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.140" end="00:52:34.340" style="s2">in order to learn more we put it there I</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.510" end="00:52:35.930" style="s2">feel like I would not not to not to get</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.340" end="00:52:39.050" style="s2">away from this on this here and now too</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.930" end="00:52:40.880" style="s2">much but I feel like there&#39;s elements</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.050" end="00:52:43.040" style="s2">there they would love to see out there</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.880" end="00:52:45.700" style="s2">sometimes when people are are feeling</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.040" end="00:52:45.700" style="s2">these kinds of pains</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.839" end="00:52:55.829" style="s2">could you expand on that a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.249" end="00:53:01.529" style="s2">more what kinds of pains and what would</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.829" end="00:53:04.710" style="s2">you like to see uh when I mean one this</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.529" end="00:53:07.140" style="s2">is just one one expression of it perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.710" end="00:53:09.630" style="s2">but when there&#39;s when there&#39;s groups and</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.140" end="00:53:11.970" style="s2">they feel unity and there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.630" end="00:53:17.549" style="s2">just a place for that people want to go</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.970" end="00:53:19.680" style="s2">and others don&#39;t but there&#39;s a definite</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.549" end="00:53:22.410" style="s2">rejection of the police aspects of it</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.680" end="00:53:25.109" style="s2">aspects that feel they feel essential</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.410" end="00:53:27.089" style="s2">right it&#39;s sacred or without the word</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.109" end="00:53:30.420" style="s2">those words necessarily units felt of</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.089" end="00:53:33.390" style="s2">course and how and how much that can</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.420" end="00:53:35.640" style="s2">cause and it can cause a lot of pain and</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.390" end="00:53:38.700" style="s2">people can respond without really</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.640" end="00:53:40.519" style="s2">understanding the experience I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.700" end="00:53:45.950" style="s2">gonna need too many unfortunate things</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.519" end="00:53:45.950" style="s2">and that helps</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.380" end="00:54:02.960" style="s2">I feel like I&#39;m I am resonating with</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.170" end="00:54:06.350" style="s2">both Tim and milk said that I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.960" end="00:54:09.230" style="s2">kind of thinking about it in terms of</p>

<p begin="00:54:09.230" end="00:54:14.090" style="s2">through process I found that certain</p>

<p begin="00:54:34.400" end="00:54:40.940" style="s2">sure and it is kind of like the blocks</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.260" end="00:54:45.740" style="s2">that we have with other people in</p>

<p begin="00:58:10.720" end="00:58:16.839" style="s2">often cultural kind of places and I like</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.780" end="00:58:21.220" style="s2">to dance with my headphones and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.839" end="00:58:23.770" style="s2">interesting because you know anyone</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.220" end="00:58:26.970" style="s2">could go out there and move around but</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.770" end="00:58:29.980" style="s2">if you move in a way that is somehow</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.970" end="00:58:34.000" style="s2">pained or discordance it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.980" end="00:58:37.050" style="s2">very unsettling and it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.000" end="00:58:42.550" style="s2">interesting to watch when people feel</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.050" end="00:58:46.000" style="s2">relaxed around me in a space and often</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.550" end="00:58:49.720" style="s2">when I&#39;m moving feels very similar to</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.000" end="00:58:53.730" style="s2">thinking and so it seems to be quite</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.720" end="00:59:00.930" style="s2">remarkable that how we hold ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.730" end="00:59:05.180" style="s2">is enabling of safety and again an</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.930" end="00:59:10.140" style="s2">invitation to participate and ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.180" end="00:59:12.160" style="s2">be winners and transform the not knowing</p>

<p begin="00:59:12.160" end="00:59:18.940" style="s2">a certain state of vulnerability that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.440" end="00:59:22.510" style="s2">nevertheless connected somehow with you</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.940" end="00:59:26.109" style="s2">know some sort of elegance and a desire</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.510" end="00:59:29.799" style="s2">ultimately to be helpful you know to</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.109" end="00:59:31.690" style="s2">offer something to the space and you</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.799" end="00:59:33.819" style="s2">know you see and we could go to a club</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.690" end="00:59:35.380" style="s2">or a bar or something someone comes</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.819" end="00:59:37.480" style="s2">along and bring some real life with</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.380" end="00:59:38.980" style="s2">their movement it just lifts everything</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.480" end="00:59:40.390" style="s2">you know someone just comes in and</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.980" end="00:59:42.789" style="s2">people are willing for that to happen</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.390" end="00:59:46.599" style="s2">and there&#39;s a way people can open this</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.789" end="00:59:48.609" style="s2">space like that and it&#39;s some there</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.599" end="00:59:52.800" style="s2">seems to be a deep continuity there in</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.609" end="00:59:56.130" style="s2">what we pick up on and so</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.800" end="01:00:01.400" style="s2">I find that drop experientially the</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.130" end="01:00:01.400" style="s2">state is quite similar yeah</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.560" end="01:00:08.620" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.260" end="01:00:26.380" style="s2">I was just wondering if anyone has</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.010" end="01:00:30.490" style="s2">experienced where your heart or your</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.380" end="01:00:33.609" style="s2">mind wants to connect but you feel</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.490" end="01:00:36.310" style="s2">physical resistance like for example</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.609" end="01:00:40.900" style="s2">during that meditation and actually just</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.310" end="01:00:42.790" style="s2">during life in general I find that my</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.900" end="01:00:45.700" style="s2">heart always yearned to be closer to</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.790" end="01:00:50.410" style="s2">people and to you know feel more</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.700" end="01:00:52.210" style="s2">connected but physically I feel stuck</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.410" end="01:00:56.200" style="s2">and I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.210" end="01:00:59.560" style="s2">that comes from you know deep inside or</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.200" end="01:01:01.600" style="s2">maybe past trauma yeah I was just</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.560" end="01:01:05.850" style="s2">wondering what you know whether other</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.600" end="01:01:05.850" style="s2">people have experienced that sort of</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.240" end="01:01:12.010" style="s2">push and pull of like you wanna be close</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.550" end="01:01:18.670" style="s2">and connected but you know something&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.010" end="01:01:23.080" style="s2">holding you back yeah I am I feel like</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.670" end="01:01:26.350" style="s2">quite a lot taraf it&#39;s really a strange</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.080" end="01:01:29.020" style="s2">experience because on one hand you</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.350" end="01:01:31.810" style="s2">actually know deep down that you really</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.020" end="01:01:35.020" style="s2">care about the person all the people or</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.810" end="01:01:37.230" style="s2">whatever it is I I personally get this</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.020" end="01:01:41.640" style="s2">thing right even though I feel that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.230" end="01:01:44.050" style="s2">still incapable of articulating things</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.640" end="01:01:46.540" style="s2">that I know the other person needs to</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.050" end="01:01:49.660" style="s2">hear and then I probably should say</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.540" end="01:01:51.100" style="s2">follow the relationship as a whole but</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.660" end="01:01:55.240" style="s2">there&#39;s like as you say that was like</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.100" end="01:01:59.740" style="s2">this weird physical like wall that kind</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.240" end="01:02:01.750" style="s2">of filters things through and I I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.740" end="01:02:03.160" style="s2">almost also thought that I&#39;m kind of</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.750" end="01:02:04.590" style="s2">like the other person feels like that so</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.160" end="01:02:08.650" style="s2">it&#39;s nice to know that somebody else</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.590" end="01:02:11.100" style="s2">shares that same kind of thing I thought</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.650" end="01:02:11.100" style="s2">I was going crazy</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.530" end="01:02:28.800" style="s2">I&#39;m curious to know you know how maybe</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.850" end="01:02:31.600" style="s2">other people have addressed that or I</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.800" end="01:02:35.050" style="s2">mean I really it kind of comes down to</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.600" end="01:02:39.310" style="s2">you know letting your your your wall</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.050" end="01:02:41.530" style="s2">down or your protection yeah any</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.310" end="01:02:44.070" style="s2">thoughts on how other people have been</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.530" end="01:02:44.070" style="s2">able to do that</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.040" end="01:02:51.230" style="s2">I can only speak from personal</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.530" end="01:02:58.190" style="s2">experience and I&#39;m by from when a means</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.230" end="01:02:59.930" style="s2">an expert in that but I would say like</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.190" end="01:03:01.940" style="s2">any of these things that come up for us</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.930" end="01:03:06.470" style="s2">I think the first step is being aware of</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.940" end="01:03:11.720" style="s2">it when it happens and once you sort of</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.470" end="01:03:13.880" style="s2">captured that awareness I I sort of</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.720" end="01:03:17.930" style="s2">delve into if possible like if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.880" end="01:03:21.190" style="s2">not in a situation where you can&#39;t tell</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.930" end="01:03:24.470" style="s2">into it in a sort of meditative practice</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.190" end="01:03:27.670" style="s2">it almost asked the question well where</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.470" end="01:03:27.670" style="s2">is where is this coming from</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.359" end="01:03:35.809" style="s2">us and I find that sometimes can help to</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.390" end="01:03:38.859" style="s2">identify the cause of over what might be</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.809" end="01:03:40.910" style="s2">the rate where it&#39;s originating from I</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.859" end="01:03:43.040" style="s2">don&#39;t always get an answer to that</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.910" end="01:03:46.069" style="s2">question but I think I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.040" end="01:03:49.220" style="s2">useful sort of pathway to take in those</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.069" end="01:03:51.880" style="s2">remnants this year as you sort of said</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.220" end="01:03:54.049" style="s2">you kind of know what you need to do but</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.880" end="01:03:55.430" style="s2">for some reason you can&#39;t and I think</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.049" end="01:04:02.450" style="s2">it&#39;s something it&#39;s useful to so delve</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.430" end="01:04:07.220" style="s2">into why why they tweaked on I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.450" end="01:04:10.970" style="s2">get in on that question I mean I think I</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.220" end="01:04:14.809" style="s2">could not relate more directly to the</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.970" end="01:04:23.750" style="s2">question of do you feel physical</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.809" end="01:04:28.549" style="s2">resistance in your body and I think that</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.750" end="01:04:29.839" style="s2">the first I would connect us back to</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.549" end="01:04:32.319" style="s2">another question from the meditation</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.839" end="01:04:37.849" style="s2">where we were being asked to consider</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.319" end="01:04:43.430" style="s2">what we are and the meditation really</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.849" end="01:04:44.960" style="s2">wisely asks you to notice that what you</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.430" end="01:04:48.890" style="s2">are is not separate from what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.960" end="01:04:51.020" style="s2">experiencing and I would connect that to</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.890" end="01:04:54.559" style="s2">this question by saying that when I feel</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.020" end="01:04:56.660" style="s2">that resistance I often have I want to</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.559" end="01:04:58.400" style="s2">locate that resistance external to</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.660" end="01:05:02.029" style="s2">myself I want</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.400" end="01:05:07.010" style="s2">make it about whether or not the other</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.029" end="01:05:09.289" style="s2">person is right or and you know like and</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.010" end="01:05:11.210" style="s2">whatever sense of right like are they</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.289" end="01:05:13.819" style="s2">logically correct are they factually</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.210" end="01:05:17.000" style="s2">correct are they whatever but to make it</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.819" end="01:05:20.059" style="s2">some kind of intellectual game I feel</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.000" end="01:05:25.520" style="s2">this way because someone else is wrong</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.059" end="01:05:27.490" style="s2">in some way or maybe it&#39;s connected to</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.520" end="01:05:29.930" style="s2">some trauma that I have it&#39;s bringing up</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.490" end="01:05:32.420" style="s2">you know something from my own past and</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.930" end="01:05:37.250" style="s2">sentimental relationships or or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.420" end="01:05:39.319" style="s2">that is and I don&#39;t notice that that</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.250" end="01:05:43.579" style="s2">feeling comes from within me I feel like</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.319" end="01:05:45.740" style="s2">it must be something about the universe</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.579" end="01:05:48.410" style="s2">or the other person that&#39;s causing this</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.740" end="01:05:51.289" style="s2">in me but when I stop to meditate like</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.410" end="01:05:52.940" style="s2">what what is this what is this feeling</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.289" end="01:05:56.980" style="s2">that I&#39;m having I noticed that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.940" end="01:05:56.980" style="s2">external to me that it&#39;s inside of me</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.590" end="01:06:06.800" style="s2">I want to add that I have a similar</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.810" end="01:06:09.020" style="s2">experience quite often of recognizing</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.800" end="01:06:12.410" style="s2">that it&#39;s internal to me I&#39;ve developed</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.020" end="01:06:15.770" style="s2">a little bit of a pragmatic habit for</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.410" end="01:06:19.130" style="s2">dealing with situations like that I sort</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.770" end="01:06:22.400" style="s2">of used a mnemonic to remind myself of a</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.130" end="01:06:24.770" style="s2">state of clarity and I use it when I</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.400" end="01:06:27.140" style="s2">don&#39;t have the time to actually dive</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.770" end="01:06:28.790" style="s2">into my emotions but there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.140" end="01:06:32.240" style="s2">interesting that I want to mention about</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.790" end="01:06:34.760" style="s2">that demen demonic is just a really</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.240" end="01:06:37.750" style="s2">quick motion where I tapped the center</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.760" end="01:06:41.360" style="s2">of our head and it just sort of clears</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.750" end="01:06:44.180" style="s2">clears my mental space and I immediately</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.360" end="01:06:46.880" style="s2">feel lighter I immediately feel easier</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.180" end="01:06:49.610" style="s2">and it just allows me to be more present</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.880" end="01:06:52.970" style="s2">in the moment because it basically like</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.610" end="01:06:55.640" style="s2">hard wipes whatever was on my mind that</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.970" end="01:07:00.410" style="s2">was taking up so much space and I&#39;m you</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.640" end="01:07:03.400" style="s2">know cluttering up the fluidity of my</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.410" end="01:07:06.500" style="s2">present like cluttering cluttering me up</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.400" end="01:07:07.640" style="s2">but I think it&#39;s I take it one really</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.500" end="01:07:10.370" style="s2">interesting thing about these</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.640" end="01:07:13.220" style="s2">experiences is that I noticed that I</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.370" end="01:07:16.520" style="s2">don&#39;t always use it and I think that I</p>

<p begin="01:07:21.910" end="01:07:27.710" style="s2">important to the other person in a</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.380" end="01:07:29.650" style="s2">conversation and that I notice when when</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.710" end="01:07:33.920" style="s2">I attend to the fact that there&#39;s more</p>

<p begin="01:07:33.920" end="01:07:37.910" style="s2">this is a personal relationship and we</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.990" end="01:07:40.370" style="s2">have a dynamic that we&#39;re developing and</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.910" end="01:07:43.570" style="s2">there&#39;s something important to them then</p>

<p begin="01:07:43.570" end="01:07:47.570" style="s2">whatever&#39;s stopping me from being able</p>

<p begin="01:07:47.570" end="01:07:54.890" style="s2">person but it&#39;s odd that I don&#39;t do this</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.740" end="01:07:56.600" style="s2">so often when I don&#39;t attend when I</p>

<p begin="01:08:04.820" end="01:08:09.050" style="s2">be something that&#39;s internal to me</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.070" end="01:08:11.900" style="s2">that&#39;s it&#39;s clunking up the conversation</p>

<p begin="01:08:16.580" end="01:08:21.170" style="s2">the awareness that Tristan mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.740" end="01:08:24.740" style="s2">that the awareness of this comes first</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.170" end="01:08:27.110" style="s2">it&#39;s there&#39;s something that needs to be</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.740" end="01:08:29.060" style="s2">there some awareness in order for us to</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.110" end="01:08:30.860" style="s2">be able to meaningfully pull out a</p>

<p begin="01:08:36.290" end="01:08:47.060" style="s2">more deeply more president Li I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.770" end="01:08:49.970" style="s2">curious if you in those moments have</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.060" end="01:08:53.390" style="s2">ever actually got to a point where you</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.970" end="01:08:54.800" style="s2">were aware of it but you still felt felt</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.390" end="01:08:59.920" style="s2">that there was this block and you still</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.800" end="01:09:04.820" style="s2">decided to to not say or do the thing</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.920" end="01:09:07.840" style="s2">even though you&#39;re very salient of what</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.820" end="01:09:07.840" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t needed to be done</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.560" end="01:09:21.600" style="s2">hmm it&#39;s a good question</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.420" end="01:09:23.690" style="s2">I think it&#39;s I say that cuz I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.600" end="01:09:27.000" style="s2">experienced it quite a lot</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.690" end="01:09:30.929" style="s2">hmm the idea of becoming aware of a</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.000" end="01:09:36.120" style="s2">block but not being able to move it</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.929" end="01:09:38.640" style="s2">I think I think there&#39;s a caveat I</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.120" end="01:09:40.589" style="s2">should add that I probably have only</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.640" end="01:09:44.489" style="s2">done this in situations where I was</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.589" end="01:09:46.339" style="s2">aware somehow somewhere some part of me</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.489" end="01:09:48.719" style="s2">was aware would needed to be done</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.339" end="01:09:53.600" style="s2">whether whether that was just holding</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.719" end="01:09:57.239" style="s2">space in being curious which it often is</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.600" end="01:09:59.250" style="s2">so I felt like because because I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.239" end="01:10:02.330" style="s2">more awareness of what should be done</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.250" end="01:10:04.710" style="s2">once I&#39;ve chosen to engage that way I</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.330" end="01:10:07.290" style="s2">don&#39;t have a lot of moments like that</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.710" end="01:10:09.989" style="s2">but I but I have had plenty of moments</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.290" end="01:10:11.790" style="s2">where for whatever reason I haven&#39;t sort</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.989" end="01:10:14.070" style="s2">of reconnected with that part of myself</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.790" end="01:10:17.100" style="s2">that&#39;s there and can listen and can be</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.070" end="01:10:19.290" style="s2">there and and I&#39;ve often had that where</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.100" end="01:10:23.310" style="s2">I noticed there&#39;s a problem but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.290" end="01:10:26.210" style="s2">throw up the mnemonic and and then I the</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.310" end="01:10:28.800" style="s2">problem just kind of sticks around and</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.210" end="01:10:31.469" style="s2">and then my rational mind gets really</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.800" end="01:10:32.880" style="s2">really all up in it and says I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.469" end="01:10:35.460" style="s2">gonna solve this problem pragmatically</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.880" end="01:10:37.110" style="s2">here&#39;s a here&#39;s the function that will</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.460" end="01:10:42.210" style="s2">speed up our conversation and get us to</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.110" end="01:10:42.840" style="s2">the point where we want to be less</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.210" end="01:10:45.840" style="s2">comfortable</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.840" end="01:10:47.410" style="s2">I always feel uncomfortable when that</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.840" end="01:10:49.330" style="s2">happens</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.410" end="01:11:01.930" style="s2">I don&#39;t feel happy about myself about</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.330" end="01:11:04.420" style="s2">that either I&#39;ve questioned my friend</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.930" end="01:11:05.410" style="s2">pointed out to me that I would always</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.420" end="01:11:09.280" style="s2">look at my hand</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.410" end="01:11:12.160" style="s2">all right and then I realized I was</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.280" end="01:11:14.230" style="s2">doing the same thing that that he said</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.160" end="01:11:16.570" style="s2">you did when you and he tapped your head</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.230" end="01:11:20.110" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like I was reminding myself</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.570" end="01:11:24.430" style="s2">that I can take a third-person view of</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.110" end="01:11:28.390" style="s2">what I&#39;m doing and I was doing it</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.430" end="01:11:30.010" style="s2">unconsciously so I I&#39;m wondering if but</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.390" end="01:11:37.720" style="s2">but then when I realized that I was</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.010" end="01:11:42.000" style="s2">doing it when did you realize that this</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.720" end="01:11:46.090" style="s2">was a thing and and afterwards did you</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.000" end="01:11:48.460" style="s2">did that change your use of it or like</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.090" end="01:11:50.530" style="s2">did you ever do it unconsciously and not</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.460" end="01:11:54.120" style="s2">realized for a time and then realized it</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.530" end="01:11:54.120" style="s2">and then used it differently</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.479" end="01:12:00.800" style="s2">ah so Kelly before I answer I want to</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.030" end="01:12:02.749" style="s2">say that I heard a lot of really loud</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.800" end="01:12:05.030" style="s2">audio from your side and I&#39;m not sure if</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.749" end="01:12:06.409" style="s2">there&#39;s something that you can tweak</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.030" end="01:12:10.159" style="s2">about that but there was some really</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.409" end="01:12:11.599" style="s2">loud sounds that came from your side if</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.159" end="01:12:15.920" style="s2">there&#39;s something you can do about them</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.599" end="01:12:17.209" style="s2">but to answer a question no there were</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.920" end="01:12:18.979" style="s2">other things that I&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.209" end="01:12:22.309" style="s2">subconsciously sort of without being</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.979" end="01:12:25.489" style="s2">aware of it but this particular thing it</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.309" end="01:12:27.050" style="s2">came from the idea fundamentally that we</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.489" end="01:12:30.860" style="s2">can grow as people and we can become</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.050" end="01:12:33.190" style="s2">better human beings and that I&#39;ve had a</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.860" end="01:12:35.300" style="s2">few experiences that were really</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.190" end="01:12:36.889" style="s2">motivating and eye-opening that said I</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.300" end="01:12:39.199" style="s2">could do better and I can have better</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.889" end="01:12:42.199" style="s2">relationships and I can live a more</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.199" end="01:12:44.059" style="s2">meaningful present life and then I and</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.199" end="01:12:46.099" style="s2">then I developed this and I said okay</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.059" end="01:12:48.769" style="s2">well how am I going to do this I need I</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.099" end="01:12:51.709" style="s2">need a mnemonic and then I trained it</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.769" end="01:12:54.170" style="s2">and I sat at home and I went okay this</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.709" end="01:12:56.269" style="s2">is the mindset these are the theme</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.170" end="01:13:00.860" style="s2">feelings these are the emotions this is</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.269" end="01:13:03.639" style="s2">the awareness it must connect here and I</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.860" end="01:13:08.599" style="s2">just repeated that a couple of times and</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.639" end="01:13:11.409" style="s2">felt it and visualized it and then I</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.599" end="01:13:13.780" style="s2">practiced it in easier settings I</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.409" end="01:13:16.400" style="s2">practiced it where I thought it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.780" end="01:13:17.840" style="s2">so hard to activate that part of myself</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.400" end="01:13:20.630" style="s2">where I was already sort of vaguely</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.840" end="01:13:23.809" style="s2">aware that yeah I could pull that that</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.630" end="01:13:25.969" style="s2">mode of me in and then once I practiced</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.809" end="01:13:28.219" style="s2">it it became easier then I was and then</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.969" end="01:13:33.800" style="s2">I started being able to do it in other</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.219" end="01:13:40.130" style="s2">situations for me yeah it doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.800" end="01:13:40.969" style="s2">that that&#39;s that&#39;s pretty cool I think</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.130" end="01:13:43.130" style="s2">one of the other things I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.969" end="01:13:46.369" style="s2">realizing a few DISA said that you Lee</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.130" end="01:13:50.239" style="s2">was there like different intensities of</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.369" end="01:13:52.610" style="s2">it as well and I found that um now that</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.239" end="01:13:54.979" style="s2">I&#39;m looking back on it it sort of</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.610" end="01:13:58.489" style="s2">depends on the environment and the</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.979" end="01:14:03.110" style="s2">activity that I was in that that some</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.489" end="01:14:05.809" style="s2">things actually generate that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.110" end="01:14:08.360" style="s2">response and for me personally it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.809" end="01:14:09.780" style="s2">whenever I&#39;m working on computers and in</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.360" end="01:14:14.369" style="s2">technology</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.780" end="01:14:16.559" style="s2">or doing anything where I&#39;m super</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.369" end="01:14:20.449" style="s2">conscious and using using the prefrontal</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.559" end="01:14:22.469" style="s2">cortexes pros a lot in regards to</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.449" end="01:14:26.210" style="s2">solving some kind of intellectual</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.469" end="01:14:30.479" style="s2">problem I&#39;m less likely to engage on</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.210" end="01:14:33.869" style="s2">that emotional side of things it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.479" end="01:14:37.469" style="s2">almost like those walls come up and and</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.869" end="01:14:40.829" style="s2">the more I go into that sort of</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.469" end="01:14:44.340" style="s2">conscious analytical side of things the</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.829" end="01:14:45.769" style="s2">the thicker that will get which is kind</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.340" end="01:14:47.940" style="s2">of a problem because I work as a</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.769" end="01:14:51.150" style="s2">programmer so I&#39;m in that space a lot</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.940" end="01:14:54.539" style="s2">and it&#39;s actually caused a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.150" end="01:14:55.739" style="s2">problems for myself for my wife and yeah</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.539" end="01:14:59.280" style="s2">it&#39;s just kind of interesting to</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.739" end="01:15:01.199" style="s2">recognize when these things happen and</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.280" end="01:15:03.449" style="s2">what is it that there are actually</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.199" end="01:15:06.300" style="s2">certain activities and I think what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.449" end="01:15:07.920" style="s2">interesting is that by by being aware of</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.300" end="01:15:09.570" style="s2">what actually triggers it in the first</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.920" end="01:15:12.210" style="s2">place it might actually help you to go</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.570" end="01:15:14.940" style="s2">into that activity without awareness</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.210" end="01:15:17.309" style="s2">that hey if somebody does come and</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.940" end="01:15:20.729" style="s2">interact with me I need to be super</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.309" end="01:15:23.309" style="s2">cognizant of super salient of that this</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.729" end="01:15:27.050" style="s2">is a problem usually when when I partake</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.309" end="01:15:27.050" style="s2">in this kind of kind of thing</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.300" end="01:15:38.470" style="s2">I&#39;m sorry good Oh</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.940" end="01:15:40.570" style="s2">I was gonna ask a question - I was</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.470" end="01:15:44.740" style="s2">reminded of Tara&#39;s original question</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.570" end="01:15:49.750" style="s2">while Tristan was speaking and I became</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.740" end="01:15:51.280" style="s2">curious to know if the awareness of that</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.750" end="01:15:54.550" style="s2">wall looks different for different</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.280" end="01:15:57.580" style="s2">people like maybe I can imagine it would</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.550" end="01:15:59.530" style="s2">take different form in in our bodies but</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.580" end="01:16:03.730" style="s2">I wonder if there are other things like</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.530" end="01:16:06.730" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s certainly for me it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.730" end="01:16:08.590" style="s2">always physical I might feel it</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.730" end="01:16:10.780" style="s2">physically because of tension but I sort</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.590" end="01:16:12.640" style="s2">of almost like for me that tension feels</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.780" end="01:16:15.370" style="s2">like it&#39;s self created and the real wall</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.640" end="01:16:16.930" style="s2">is mental it&#39;s abstract it&#39;s a set of</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.370" end="01:16:19.630" style="s2">thoughts that are taking up mental space</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.930" end="01:16:22.270" style="s2">and I wonder if there are different</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.630" end="01:16:24.600" style="s2">types of feelings people have felt when</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.270" end="01:16:29.080" style="s2">they feel something like that wall</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.600" end="01:16:31.000" style="s2">because I I don&#39;t know if yeah I would</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.080" end="01:16:32.620" style="s2">imagine that the experiences are</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.000" end="01:16:35.260" style="s2">different and probably the solutions</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.620" end="01:16:37.030" style="s2">have to be different than and I&#39;m super</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.260" end="01:16:38.710" style="s2">curious to see what other people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.030" end="01:16:46.570" style="s2">awareness of this kind of sensation has</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.710" end="01:16:49.330" style="s2">been like what&#39;s coming up for me and</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.570" end="01:16:54.160" style="s2">this is sort of a device that I I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.330" end="01:16:55.300" style="s2">developing I return to and Terra comes</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.160" end="01:16:57.070" style="s2">to mind because I know she&#39;s plugged</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.300" end="01:16:59.080" style="s2">into the stoic community and this is</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.070" end="01:17:02.200" style="s2">sort of like a stoic algorithm that I</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.080" end="01:17:07.390" style="s2">run anytime my serenity gets disrupted</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.200" end="01:17:13.240" style="s2">or disturbed and it&#39;s sort of like this</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.390" end="01:17:17.500" style="s2">default frame that every single emotion</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.240" end="01:17:21.120" style="s2">or felt sense that I experience is sort</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.500" end="01:17:23.260" style="s2">of like a friend giving me advice and</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.120" end="01:17:25.240" style="s2">sometimes that friend is not always</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.260" end="01:17:26.260" style="s2">giving me the best advice Ric sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.240" end="01:17:30.970" style="s2">friends don&#39;t always give the best</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.260" end="01:17:32.620" style="s2">advice but they mean well and so when I</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.970" end="01:17:34.120" style="s2">feel an emotion that&#39;s intense that</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.620" end="01:17:36.670" style="s2">throws me out of the the moment or the</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.120" end="01:17:38.320" style="s2">here and now I just give I say thank you</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.670" end="01:17:40.639" style="s2">you know I said like thank you friend</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.320" end="01:17:43.010" style="s2">for for giving me this advice right now</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.639" end="01:17:44.929" style="s2">and that sort of just that alone just</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.010" end="01:17:47.929" style="s2">sort of kind of like calms calms it down</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.929" end="01:17:51.109" style="s2">a bit and then maybe I can return to it</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.929" end="01:17:55.010" style="s2">and and sort of do some work in her work</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.109" end="01:17:57.800" style="s2">on it but by doing this you kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.010" end="01:17:59.539" style="s2">I got a sensitivity to the like I guess</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.800" end="01:18:02.379" style="s2">the ecology of felt senses that are</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.539" end="01:18:04.969" style="s2">operating in my body and and having a</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.379" end="01:18:07.519" style="s2">relationship with each one of them and</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.969" end="01:18:09.829" style="s2">then building a sensitivity when when</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.519" end="01:18:11.119" style="s2">they get triggered when they return and</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.829" end="01:18:13.189" style="s2">just building a relationship with that</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.119" end="01:18:17.539" style="s2">friend that device that that emotion</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.189" end="01:18:19.789" style="s2">that that felt sense and I think by</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.539" end="01:18:21.979" style="s2">doing that in my own body my own</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.789" end="01:18:24.109" style="s2">awareness I feel it and other people</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.979" end="01:18:28.609" style="s2">more when when those felt senses become</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.109" end="01:18:29.780" style="s2">activated in them and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.609" end="01:18:32.899" style="s2">helping me become a more of intuitive</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.780" end="01:18:34.969" style="s2">person so just just the right thing to</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.899" end="01:18:37.879" style="s2">say at the right time becomes more clear</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.969" end="01:18:39.859" style="s2">when when I&#39;m with someone who is also</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.879" end="01:18:42.579" style="s2">in a state where their their serenity is</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.859" end="01:18:42.579" style="s2">disrupted</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.290" end="01:18:57.430" style="s2">sounds to me like Peter you there it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.610" end="01:18:59.890" style="s2">movement of creating and re-establishing</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.430" end="01:19:02.230" style="s2">a we space rather than an ask them of</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.890" end="01:19:05.380" style="s2">somehow some trigger point being</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.230" end="01:19:09.310" style="s2">challenged some opens it back up again</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.380" end="01:19:12.850" style="s2">to really being with and ultimately yeah</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.310" end="01:19:17.290" style="s2">collaborating it&#39;s a nice yeah I like</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.850" end="01:19:21.250" style="s2">that sort of um it&#39;s like finding your</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.290" end="01:19:25.450" style="s2">way back to communitas and one thing</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.250" end="01:19:27.880" style="s2">like just an example like right now when</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.450" end="01:19:29.400" style="s2">I noticed when people were asking</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.880" end="01:19:32.350" style="s2">questions like direct questions</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.400" end="01:19:34.090" style="s2">annoyance was coming up in my body and</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.350" end="01:19:38.560" style="s2">like no don&#39;t ask questions because I</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.090" end="01:19:41.830" style="s2">have like a story that like if we want a</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.560" end="01:19:44.140" style="s2">midwife a community oz asking question</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.830" end="01:19:46.120" style="s2">creates a different energy it&#39;s like and</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.140" end="01:19:47.890" style="s2">I&#39;m more analytical more and we&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.120" end="01:19:51.730" style="s2">in your head and it&#39;s less from your</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.890" end="01:19:53.140" style="s2">heart and I don&#39;t know if this is</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.730" end="01:19:54.610" style="s2">necessarily the case but this is the</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.140" end="01:19:56.380" style="s2">story and so when I was the feeling this</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.610" end="01:19:57.370" style="s2">annoyance come up in my body I just said</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.380" end="01:20:01.110" style="s2">you know thank you</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.370" end="01:20:01.110" style="s2">and then sort of just went away a bit</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.210" end="01:20:13.090" style="s2">one thing that I&#39;ve been learning about</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.930" end="01:20:15.930" style="s2">myself is that all these talks of all</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.090" end="01:20:20.830" style="s2">this talk rather of walls and and and</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.930" end="01:20:24.520" style="s2">blocks and resistances I think I used to</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.830" end="01:20:27.690" style="s2">understand in terms of not being whole</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.520" end="01:20:31.000" style="s2">or not being perfect somehow and</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.690" end="01:20:33.220" style="s2">therefore it was very easy I think to</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.000" end="01:20:37.480" style="s2">get involved in some form of spiritual</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.220" end="01:20:40.020" style="s2">bypass as it&#39;s called or just to sweep</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.480" end="01:20:40.020" style="s2">sweep them away</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.920" end="01:20:50.660" style="s2">and then I think the inclination is to</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.469" end="01:20:55.610" style="s2">believe that walls or resistances or</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.660" end="01:20:58.300" style="s2">whatever our problems and therefore as</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.610" end="01:21:00.410" style="s2">problems they need to be gotten rid of</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.300" end="01:21:02.690" style="s2">and that took me a little while to see</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.410" end="01:21:07.600" style="s2">that that may not be the correct</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.690" end="01:21:10.790" style="s2">understanding of what they are instead</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.600" end="01:21:14.540" style="s2">the philosophical side of me is just</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.790" end="01:21:17.480" style="s2">learning to extend the inquiry in a</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.540" end="01:21:22.960" style="s2">different way so philosophy is the love</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.480" end="01:21:26.840" style="s2">the loving pursuit of truth then I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.960" end="01:21:29.930" style="s2">wondering about how any kind of</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.840" end="01:21:31.550" style="s2">resistance I have is actually know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.930" end="01:21:36.530" style="s2">speaking in mystical terms but as a</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.550" end="01:21:39.350" style="s2">pointer it&#39;s a pointer to what someone</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.530" end="01:21:44.600" style="s2">call the nameless absolute the upon</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.350" end="01:21:47.900" style="s2">Ishod suggests that every every form in</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.600" end="01:21:52.670" style="s2">name is actually a pointer or a longing</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.900" end="01:21:56.180" style="s2">for the absolute so another way of</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.670" end="01:21:58.190" style="s2">putting all this is that when I sense</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.180" end="01:22:01.400" style="s2">some kind of resistance I have whatever</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.190" end="01:22:04.880" style="s2">it is I can I can say thank you as Peter</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.400" end="01:22:09.380" style="s2">did and and then I can see where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.880" end="01:22:11.770" style="s2">carrying me what kind of truth and</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.380" end="01:22:15.469" style="s2">pretty broad sense is trying to disclose</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.770" end="01:22:16.820" style="s2">as a consequence I&#39;m not thinking that</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.469" end="01:22:18.860" style="s2">this is a problem anymore</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.820" end="01:22:23.350" style="s2">it&#39;s what Buddhists call a Dharma door</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.860" end="01:22:26.000" style="s2">or a gateless gate and that has made it</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.350" end="01:22:30.520" style="s2">it&#39;s partly conceptual but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.000" end="01:22:34.550" style="s2">partly meditative or contemplatively</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.520" end="01:22:36.920" style="s2">shifted my willingness to to really love</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.550" end="01:22:39.380" style="s2">the truth as it arises in my ordinary</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.920" end="01:22:42.860" style="s2">experience and to see what is behind or</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.380" end="01:22:47.070" style="s2">beneath or both what&#39;s presenting itself</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.860" end="01:22:50.870" style="s2">to me once more</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.070" end="01:22:50.870" style="s2">Mystikal weaning</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.820" end="01:22:58.880" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.730" end="01:23:11.320" style="s2">I actually really resonated with one</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.840" end="01:23:13.210" style="s2">point that you made about sort of</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.320" end="01:23:15.310" style="s2">feeling like the resistance maybe came</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.210" end="01:23:17.650" style="s2">from like something you didn&#39;t you know</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.310" end="01:23:20.910" style="s2">you didn&#39;t feel like you were perfect or</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.650" end="01:23:23.380" style="s2">maybe not good enough I I was kind of</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.910" end="01:23:27.100" style="s2">pondering on the idea that I feel like</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.380" end="01:23:29.680" style="s2">for me especially my resistance I think</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.100" end="01:23:33.610" style="s2">comes from a place of feeling different</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.680" end="01:23:34.960" style="s2">than other people and I think generally</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.610" end="01:23:37.750" style="s2">a lot of people that are more</p>

<p begin="01:32:37.320" end="01:32:41.519" style="s2">good conversations with it then you know</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.360" end="01:32:43.820" style="s2">and maybe a good relationship conform</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.519" end="01:32:43.820" style="s2">with it</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.070" end="01:32:57.230" style="s2">I really appreciate what you just said</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.130" end="01:32:57.230" style="s2">there something just clicked for dead</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.560" end="01:33:04.480" style="s2">nice your money yeah I think that idea</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.719" end="01:33:05.710" style="s2">of like if you if you were to describe</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.480" end="01:33:08.800" style="s2">the wall what would it be</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.710" end="01:33:12.730" style="s2">that&#39;s like a really interesting concept</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.800" end="01:33:14.440" style="s2">because I think the more you sort of</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.730" end="01:33:15.730" style="s2">delve into it and the more you break it</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.440" end="01:33:18.040" style="s2">apart the more you realize the wall</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.730" end="01:33:22.690" style="s2">isn&#39;t really kind of there it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.040" end="01:33:26.070" style="s2">these things we think are there but yeah</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.690" end="01:33:26.070" style="s2">that&#39;s a really cool exercise</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.630" end="01:33:36.830" style="s2">I really resonated with the advice to</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.030" end="01:33:39.740" style="s2">start communicating directly with all</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.830" end="01:33:41.930" style="s2">sorts of different things that could</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.740" end="01:33:43.400" style="s2">come up and trying to translate them</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.930" end="01:33:48.190" style="s2">I&#39;ve never thought of trying to</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.400" end="01:33:51.440" style="s2">translate them I&#39;ve always been I guess</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.190" end="01:33:56.540" style="s2">afraid that if I miss translate them</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.440" end="01:34:00.890" style="s2">I&#39;ll be building in sort of poor habits</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.540" end="01:34:02.810" style="s2">or poor responses but I I really</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.890" end="01:34:06.110" style="s2">appreciate this because you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.810" end="01:34:08.920" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s not I have to start the</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.110" end="01:34:11.120" style="s2">conversation somewhere and and</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.920" end="01:34:12.860" style="s2">practicing that conversation in a</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.120" end="01:34:14.720" style="s2">comfortable space that&#39;s my own like a</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.860" end="01:34:16.000" style="s2">journal seems like a really good way of</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.720" end="01:34:19.400" style="s2">doing that</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.000" end="01:34:21.860" style="s2">so I&#39;d really appreciate that it seems</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.400" end="01:34:24.129" style="s2">to work for how I&#39;ve been thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.860" end="01:34:28.169" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.129" end="01:34:28.169" style="s2">and I&#39;ll try it and see how Cass</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.439" end="01:34:36.820" style="s2">I went to a therapist who started having</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.030" end="01:34:40.090" style="s2">me do that kind of work by trying to</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.820" end="01:34:43.599" style="s2">locate where in the body you feel the</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.090" end="01:34:48.099" style="s2">resistance and you would often start</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.599" end="01:34:50.499" style="s2">roughly with like the gut the heart or</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.099" end="01:34:52.719" style="s2">the head and there&#39;s a lot of different</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.499" end="01:34:56.409" style="s2">personality constructs that use those</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.719" end="01:34:58.209" style="s2">three centers and not just personality</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.409" end="01:35:00.369" style="s2">constructs but you know lots of ancient</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.209" end="01:35:05.709" style="s2">wisdom that uses those three centers as</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.369" end="01:35:09.579" style="s2">being focuses of different ways of being</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.709" end="01:35:14.320" style="s2">and that was really helpful as a tool</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.579" end="01:35:17.050" style="s2">for me to to conjure where in my body I</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.320" end="01:35:18.909" style="s2">felt it and then try to imagine a</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.050" end="01:35:22.119" style="s2">scenario that would pull that resistance</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.909" end="01:35:22.749" style="s2">back up for me and try to seal how it</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.119" end="01:35:25.419" style="s2">begins</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.749" end="01:35:28.479" style="s2">I would arise and how it goes away all</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.419" end="01:35:33.300" style="s2">of that is very useful as something that</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.479" end="01:35:33.300" style="s2">can be noticed for me</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.360" end="01:35:45.880" style="s2">maybe we should talk to the point that</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.750" end="01:35:48.690" style="s2">Taylor made as well which I kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.880" end="01:35:54.489" style="s2">which is what is the world&#39;s purpose and</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.690" end="01:35:57.250" style="s2">how does or did it serve me I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.489" end="01:35:59.909" style="s2">reading that up just so we can address</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.250" end="01:35:59.909" style="s2">that whispers</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.489" end="01:36:11.620" style="s2">hi so I just want to say something since</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.060" end="01:36:14.820" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about how to get rid of</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.620" end="01:36:19.960" style="s2">the wall or whatever to address it what</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.820" end="01:36:22.000" style="s2">helps me and the meditation itself is</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.960" end="01:36:24.850" style="s2">helpful in that aspect it&#39;s kind of to</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.000" end="01:36:28.540" style="s2">get out of your body and to look at this</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.850" end="01:36:31.120" style="s2">as some kind of a brain imperfection or</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.540" end="01:36:34.719" style="s2">something like that and to realize oh I</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.120" end="01:36:37.810" style="s2">just have this brain or whatever you</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.719" end="01:36:41.170" style="s2">believe in some kind of feelings that I</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.810" end="01:36:44.230" style="s2">might be feeling and maybe I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.170" end="01:36:47.469" style="s2">to feel them but that&#39;s okay because</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.230" end="01:36:50.650" style="s2">everybody is imperfect I am a part of</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.469" end="01:36:53.050" style="s2">this huge universe I don&#39;t even know if</p>
<p begin="01:36:50.650" end="01:36:54.610" style="s2">the past or the future exists and so on</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.050" end="01:36:59.620" style="s2">and so forth just to get out of your</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.610" end="01:37:02.260" style="s2">body and to kind of look at yourself</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.620" end="01:37:07.150" style="s2">from a third-person perspective that</p>
<p begin="01:37:02.260" end="01:37:09.460" style="s2">that helps me now we can go on to the</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.150" end="01:37:11.640" style="s2">questions it&#39;s just one I wanted to say</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.460" end="01:37:11.640" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.160" end="01:37:19.040" style="s2">how how do you approach that Ivan how do</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.160" end="01:37:20.929" style="s2">you approach that idea of taking</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.040" end="01:37:25.510" style="s2">yourself out into the third-person G is</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.929" end="01:37:25.510" style="s2">like a an exercise you want for yourself</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.900" end="01:37:36.710" style="s2">well this I&#39;ve done this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:37:30.830" end="01:37:41.570" style="s2">meditation before so it&#39;s that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.710" end="01:37:47.060" style="s2">helps to kind of I don&#39;t know to think</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.570" end="01:37:49.790" style="s2">of yourself as I don&#39;t know it goes it</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.060" end="01:37:55.730" style="s2">goes in the direction of it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.790" end="01:37:57.710" style="s2">really matter at this particular point</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.730" end="01:38:00.290" style="s2">in time we&#39;re all imperfect we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.710" end="01:38:03.080" style="s2">gonna die we&#39;re all just nobodies in</p>
<p begin="01:38:00.290" end="01:38:07.310" style="s2">this huge universe and just realizing</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.080" end="01:38:09.679" style="s2">that kind of helps me but when you</p>
<p begin="01:38:07.310" end="01:38:14.000" style="s2">actually do the meditation you kind of</p>
<p begin="01:38:09.679" end="01:38:16.699" style="s2">feel it at the same time whew so you</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.000" end="01:38:20.210" style="s2">kind of feel yourself at ease and then</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.699" end="01:38:22.520" style="s2">I&#39;m able to analyze it more for me the</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.210" end="01:38:25.219" style="s2">other thing that helps is to actually</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.520" end="01:38:26.690" style="s2">try to understand where it&#39;s coming from</p>
<p begin="01:38:25.219" end="01:38:29.630" style="s2">well the where the wall is coming from</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.690" end="01:38:34.310" style="s2">and when I do that then I have a choice</p>
<p begin="01:38:29.630" end="01:38:37.030" style="s2">about how how I want to proceed and that</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.310" end="01:38:37.030" style="s2">kind of helps me</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.820" end="01:38:44.559" style="s2">thank you very much everyone we have</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.440" end="01:38:47.230" style="s2">about 10 minutes or so remaining give or</p>
<p begin="01:38:44.559" end="01:38:53.199" style="s2">take and I&#39;d like to take us through one</p>
<p begin="01:38:47.230" end="01:38:54.969" style="s2">final meditation together and so it</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.199" end="01:38:58.889" style="s2">might be a good idea to turn off your</p>
<p begin="01:38:54.969" end="01:39:09.570" style="s2">cameras again if you&#39;d like to do that</p>
<p begin="01:38:58.889" end="01:39:11.710" style="s2">and make sure you&#39;re on mute and again</p>
<p begin="01:39:09.570" end="01:39:15.010" style="s2">you can put yourself in a comfortable</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.710" end="01:39:18.599" style="s2">position perhaps you want to take your</p>
<p begin="01:39:15.010" end="01:39:21.099" style="s2">your glasses off if you&#39;re wearing them</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.599" end="01:39:24.309" style="s2">if you don&#39;t want to take part in</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.099" end="01:39:27.300" style="s2">meditation that&#39;s fine too we can go</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.309" end="01:39:29.199" style="s2">back to the the theme of today&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:39:27.300" end="01:39:33.789" style="s2">conversation which has been resistance</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.199" end="01:39:36.190" style="s2">or specifically walls and indeed it</p>
<p begin="01:39:33.789" end="01:39:38.800" style="s2">there&#39;s at any point in the meditation</p>
<p begin="01:39:36.190" end="01:39:43.059" style="s2">when you feel some kind of resistance or</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.800" end="01:39:46.780" style="s2">block or a wall you&#39;ve listened to all</p>
<p begin="01:39:43.059" end="01:39:48.730" style="s2">the lovely things and important things</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.780" end="01:39:50.769" style="s2">that people have said today so you might</p>
<p begin="01:39:48.730" end="01:39:52.780" style="s2">avail yourself of one of those</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.769" end="01:40:00.340" style="s2">approaches or perhaps multiple</p>
<p begin="01:39:52.780" end="01:40:03.340" style="s2">approaches okay you can have your eyes</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.340" end="01:40:05.889" style="s2">open or closed it might be easier if you</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.340" end="01:40:13.830" style="s2">have your eyes closed at least easier</p>
<p begin="01:40:05.889" end="01:40:20.010" style="s2">for many of us and and</p>
<p begin="01:40:13.830" end="01:40:26.780" style="s2">we&#39;ll start with the feet and I will</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.010" end="01:40:26.780" style="s2">invite you to install light in your feet</p>
<p begin="01:40:27.140" end="01:40:34.670" style="s2">therefore your feet the right foot first</p>
<p begin="01:40:34.750" end="01:40:41.880" style="s2">URL</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.100" end="01:40:41.880" style="s2">left foot next is just light</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.250" end="01:40:50.990" style="s2">you can imagine that or you can</p>
<p begin="01:40:46.700" end="01:40:54.170" style="s2">visualize that or you can sense that or</p>
<p begin="01:40:50.990" end="01:40:58.490" style="s2">you can feel that it&#39;s not important</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.170" end="01:41:01.840" style="s2">that there is some profound light in</p>
<p begin="01:40:58.490" end="01:41:05.050" style="s2">your feet just that there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:41:01.840" end="01:41:10.850" style="s2">intention directed toward the feet and</p>
<p begin="01:41:05.050" end="01:41:14.770" style="s2">the installation of light there and then</p>
<p begin="01:41:10.850" end="01:41:14.770" style="s2">you can take your right leg and</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.270" end="01:41:28.710" style="s2">all light all the way up your right leg</p>
<p begin="01:41:21.240" end="01:41:28.710" style="s2">to your calf the knee the thigh</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.410" end="01:41:37.740" style="s2">with the result that your right leg is</p>
<p begin="01:41:33.100" end="01:41:37.740" style="s2">entirely light</p>
<p begin="01:41:40.239" end="01:41:43.140" style="s2">emanating</p>
<p begin="01:41:44.969" end="01:41:48.949" style="s2">brilliant light</p>
<p begin="01:41:49.320" end="01:41:55.910" style="s2">likewise you can install energy in your</p>
<p begin="01:41:53.460" end="01:41:55.910" style="s2">left leg</p>
<p begin="01:41:56.329" end="01:42:06.909" style="s2">with the result that your left leg is</p>
<p begin="01:41:58.869" end="01:42:06.909" style="s2">just brilliant emanating light</p>
<p begin="01:42:09.800" end="01:42:17.989" style="s2">and now bring your</p>
<p begin="01:42:12.690" end="01:42:17.989" style="s2">attention to your genitals and your butt</p>
<p begin="01:42:19.380" end="01:42:29.780" style="s2">that area to be entirely filled up</p>
