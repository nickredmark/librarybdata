<p begin="00:05:25.260" end="00:05:28.860" style="s2">defend the status quo than to question</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.000" end="00:05:32.610" style="s2">it although tenure is supposed to allow</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.860" end="00:05:34.380" style="s2">for exactly the opposite faculty do not</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.610" end="00:05:37.500" style="s2">model authoritarianism in your own</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.380" end="00:05:41.010" style="s2">classrooms labs or studios do not rule</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.500" end="00:05:42.510" style="s2">with fear or pointless workload ruling</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.010" end="00:05:44.220" style="s2">with fear is easier perhaps an</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.510" end="00:05:46.130" style="s2">establishing trust and allowing dissent</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.220" end="00:05:48.330" style="s2">but it will backfire</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.130" end="00:05:49.740" style="s2">similarly faculty do not encourage</p>
