<p begin="00:19:22.640" end="00:19:27.280" style="s2">so this is very rich for me uh the image</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.520" end="00:19:30.320" style="s2">of course of the buddha</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.280" end="00:19:33.440" style="s2">and many of the phrases are are are</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.320" end="00:19:34.720" style="s2">are resonating with me but the ending</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.440" end="00:19:37.679" style="s2">seems to</p>

<p begin="00:19:55.520" end="00:19:59.280" style="s2">now that can be intensified</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.440" end="00:20:01.039" style="s2">in the flow state and how it can be even</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.280" end="00:20:04.640" style="s2">more intensified</p>

<p begin="00:26:48.159" end="00:26:51.520" style="s2">you are not just labeling and stepping</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.919" end="00:26:52.880" style="s2">back from it you are getting involved</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.520" end="00:26:56.159" style="s2">with the content of</p>

<p begin="00:27:58.880" end="00:28:04.480" style="s2">not doing it perfectly correctly</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.279" end="00:28:05.200" style="s2">perfectly right in the end it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.480" end="00:28:09.600" style="s2">matter</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.200" end="00:28:11.919" style="s2">as long as you maintain the continuity</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.600" end="00:28:12.640" style="s2">of practice i know that sounds like but</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.919" end="00:28:16.240" style="s2">and there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.640" end="00:28:16.720" style="s2">voice in your hands but no but there is</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.240" end="00:28:19.279" style="s2">nothing</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.720" end="00:28:19.279" style="s2">beyond that</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.240" end="00:28:26.799" style="s2">if your life transforms</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.000" end="00:28:28.000" style="s2">that is your feedback that is your</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.799" end="00:28:30.080" style="s2">feedback there is</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.000" end="00:28:31.279" style="s2">nothing within your introspective</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.080" end="00:28:34.559" style="s2">awareness</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.279" end="00:28:38.399" style="s2">that will give a infinite certainty</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.559" end="00:28:41.840" style="s2">to quell that infinite kind of debt</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.399" end="00:28:45.200" style="s2">i understand deeply believe me that</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.840" end="00:28:48.399" style="s2">that this is not an easy thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.200" end="00:28:49.360" style="s2">but doing the checking after you get on</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.399" end="00:28:51.200" style="s2">meditating</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.360" end="00:28:53.440" style="s2">is to actually get involved with the</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.200" end="00:28:57.360" style="s2">content rather than the labeling</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.440" end="00:29:01.440" style="s2">you have to try returning in trust</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.360" end="00:29:04.480" style="s2">without checking am i doing it correctly</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.440" end="00:29:07.760" style="s2">to the practice you have to trust</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.480" end="00:29:09.520" style="s2">in the practice and the process it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.760" end="00:29:11.679" style="s2">a blind trust</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.520" end="00:29:12.559" style="s2">because there&#39;s the buddha the dharma</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.679" end="00:29:16.240" style="s2">the sangha</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.559" end="00:29:19.360" style="s2">and how that unfolds in your life as i</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.240" end="00:29:19.360" style="s2">mentioned many times</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.640" end="00:29:24.960" style="s2">but that that part of your left</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.320" end="00:29:26.000" style="s2">hemisphere that likes to take credit for</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.960" end="00:29:28.960" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.000" end="00:29:30.000" style="s2">and undermine anything that it doesn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:29:30.000" end="00:29:34.880" style="s2">that it&#39;s not running it&#39;s a useful</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.600" end="00:29:37.039" style="s2">thing by the way that&#39;s why we have it</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.880" end="00:29:40.000" style="s2">it&#39;s adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.039" end="00:29:42.640" style="s2">but like everything else like every</p>

<p begin="00:29:46.480" end="00:29:50.000" style="s2">of self-deception self-destructive</p>

<p begin="00:29:52.720" end="00:29:57.600" style="s2">with this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.240" end="00:30:01.520" style="s2">hyper vigilance this is why right effort</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.600" end="00:30:03.679" style="s2">right concentration right meditation</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.520" end="00:30:06.080" style="s2">are so strongly emphasized by the buddha</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.679" end="00:30:09.360" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t mean right in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.080" end="00:30:13.440" style="s2">of meeting some standard of perfection</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.360" end="00:30:16.080" style="s2">he means right like a dextrous grip</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.440" end="00:30:16.960" style="s2">a flowing grip that is adjusting and</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.080" end="00:30:18.960" style="s2">adapting</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.960" end="00:30:20.000" style="s2">and continually self-correcting because</p>

<p begin="00:30:20.000" end="00:30:24.559" style="s2">achieving some state of final perfection</p>

<p begin="00:30:36.320" end="00:30:39.760" style="s2">at least get a glimmering taste of what</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.640" end="00:30:41.760" style="s2">i&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.760" end="00:30:46.240" style="s2">and keep centering your attention on</p>

<p begin="00:30:48.399" end="00:30:51.120" style="s2">matthew</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.360" end="00:30:52.960" style="s2">i know that alongside the internal chi</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.120" end="00:30:54.720" style="s2">kung practices their external practices</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.960" end="00:30:56.159" style="s2">more in line with physical development</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.720" end="00:30:58.880" style="s2">what role should the development of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.159" end="00:31:01.200" style="s2">body have in the ecology of practices</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.880" end="00:31:02.880" style="s2">the the the development of the body and</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.200" end="00:31:05.440" style="s2">the development of the mind are not</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.880" end="00:31:06.799" style="s2">separate developments um this is why i</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.440" end="00:31:08.240" style="s2">always say there&#39;s no friend</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.799" end="00:31:10.440" style="s2">more important than your own mind and</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.240" end="00:31:13.919" style="s2">body uh there&#39;s a deep</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.440" end="00:31:17.600" style="s2">continuity between mind and body</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.919" end="00:31:19.440" style="s2">so there i mean in this this goes even</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.600" end="00:31:20.960" style="s2">into basic stuff like i was talking</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.440" end="00:31:22.640" style="s2">about when we&#39;re doing the walking</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.960" end="00:31:25.919" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.640" end="00:31:28.399" style="s2">embodied balance</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.919" end="00:31:29.200" style="s2">the balance that you&#39;re training when</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.399" end="00:31:30.880" style="s2">you&#39;re moving</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.200" end="00:31:33.519" style="s2">and that the embodied balance and</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.880" end="00:31:34.960" style="s2">coordination in the movement</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.519" end="00:31:36.559" style="s2">the cerebellum of course is being</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.960" end="00:31:38.640" style="s2">activated for that</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.559" end="00:31:40.559" style="s2">but that same activation comes into</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.640" end="00:31:43.840" style="s2">place when we are trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.559" end="00:31:46.320" style="s2">balance and coordination in our lives</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.840" end="00:31:48.240" style="s2">the cerebellum is at work there there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.320" end="00:31:49.679" style="s2">a deep continuity</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.240" end="00:31:51.840" style="s2">developing in the body and the</p>

<p begin="00:31:51.840" end="00:31:58.880" style="s2">are two sides of the same coin</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.440" end="00:32:00.640" style="s2">this is why uh i throughout i&#39;ve tried</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.880" end="00:32:02.880" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.640" end="00:32:03.919" style="s2">and i it&#39;s hard to tell to what degree</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.880" end="00:32:08.320" style="s2">this is</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.919" end="00:32:10.559" style="s2">actually part of the asiatic</p>

<p begin="00:32:14.480" end="00:32:18.080" style="s2">mindfulness has become a very</p>

<p begin="00:32:18.080" end="00:32:21.440" style="s2">um in the west for a lot of people this</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.000" end="00:32:23.279" style="s2">is something i&#39;ve tried to</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.440" end="00:32:24.720" style="s2">compensate because i was taught</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.279" end="00:32:26.159" style="s2">something very different and that is</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.720" end="00:32:28.159" style="s2">very consonant</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.159" end="00:32:29.840" style="s2">with our best cognitive science so</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.159" end="00:32:30.640" style="s2">developing the body which isn&#39;t the same</p>
