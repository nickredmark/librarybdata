<p begin="00:00:50.970" end="00:00:55.170" style="s2">share his latest thoughts on the the</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.370" end="00:00:59.040" style="s2">meaning crisis and how it relates to</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.170" end="00:01:01.460" style="s2">this unfolding kovat 19 situation at</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.040" end="00:01:04.350" style="s2">first I suggested to John we call this</p>

<p begin="00:01:04.350" end="00:01:08.700" style="s2">the meeting Kairos mainly because I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.869" end="00:01:10.290" style="s2">been hearing a lot of people in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.700" end="00:01:12.119" style="s2">circles John and I run in saying that</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.290" end="00:01:14.009" style="s2">they have a new sense of meaning in this</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.119" end="00:01:16.979" style="s2">moment when I mentioned that to John</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.009" end="00:01:19.259" style="s2">John crudely suggested that we should be</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.979" end="00:01:22.170" style="s2">careful in conflating what feels</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.259" end="00:01:23.550" style="s2">meaningful to what feels urgent hence</p>

<p begin="00:01:26.130" end="00:01:31.650" style="s2">hand it over to John and how this</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.940" end="00:01:32.330" style="s2">session works today after he shares his</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.650" end="00:01:35.280" style="s2">thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.330" end="00:01:36.990" style="s2">I&#39;ll ask him some questions and we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.280" end="00:01:39.630" style="s2">open up for the group for questions if</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.990" end="00:01:44.280" style="s2">you have a question write it in the chat</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.630" end="00:01:46.619" style="s2">box and I will unmute you and then just</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.280" end="00:01:48.840" style="s2">read your question to John if you prefer</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.619" end="00:01:50.010" style="s2">I read your question then just indicate</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.840" end="00:01:54.690" style="s2">that when you write it in the chat box</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.010" end="00:01:57.450" style="s2">and we&#39;ll go for about 60 minutes if it</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.690" end="00:02:00.030" style="s2">goes a little bit over maybe 75 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.450" end="00:02:03.510" style="s2">if that&#39;s okay with everyone so that</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.030" end="00:02:06.320" style="s2">being said I will hand it over to John</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.510" end="00:02:06.320" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.990" end="00:02:20.340" style="s2">let&#39;s see I might have to mute you John</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.670" end="00:02:23.340" style="s2">hold on can you meet yourself right now</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.340" end="00:02:26.370" style="s2">John unmute yourself me now yep</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.340" end="00:02:29.550" style="s2">can hear you great great okay excellent</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.370" end="00:02:32.460" style="s2">we had me both uses so thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.550" end="00:02:39.780" style="s2">inviting me Peter and I&#39;m very intrigued</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.460" end="00:02:47.660" style="s2">by the question that&#39;s coming up for me</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.780" end="00:02:50.910" style="s2">right now and so I guess what I want to</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.660" end="00:02:52.980" style="s2">do is explore what&#39;s happening right now</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.910" end="00:02:56.370" style="s2">and how it might be intersecting with</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.980" end="00:02:59.610" style="s2">the meeting crisis so one thing that</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.370" end="00:03:03.990" style="s2">comes to mind is that one thing we might</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.610" end="00:03:05.850" style="s2">expect is that people are experiencing a</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.990" end="00:03:07.860" style="s2">lot of reciprocal narrowing their lives</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.850" end="00:03:10.010" style="s2">are getting narrowed their agency and</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.860" end="00:03:12.930" style="s2">their flexibility is narrowing arm</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.010" end="00:03:15.720" style="s2">they&#39;re experiencing kind of dama side</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.930" end="00:03:17.220" style="s2">in which a lot of places that they</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.720" end="00:03:20.690" style="s2">thought of as their home and where they</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.220" end="00:03:23.580" style="s2">belong where they worked are getting</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.690" end="00:03:25.110" style="s2">truncated and of course that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.580" end="00:03:28.610" style="s2">happening and I&#39;m talking to people that</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.110" end="00:03:31.680" style="s2">are experiencing this rather intensely</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.610" end="00:03:34.650" style="s2">we might also see people commenting to</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.680" end="00:03:39.959" style="s2">experience this and a really challenging</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.650" end="00:03:46.080" style="s2">manner in that they&#39;re being sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.959" end="00:03:51.390" style="s2">thrown back onto the subjectivity in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.080" end="00:03:53.100" style="s2">way that could call the way that</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.390" end="00:03:55.350" style="s2">subjectivity from Descartes on has been</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.100" end="00:03:57.440" style="s2">so central to us that&#39;s had such</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.350" end="00:04:02.220" style="s2">normally a normative authority for us</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.440" end="00:04:05.490" style="s2">and finding that the that subjectivity</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.220" end="00:04:08.060" style="s2">does not have that much resources to</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.490" end="00:04:12.870" style="s2">provide them with what they need to</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.060" end="00:04:15.180" style="s2">confront the radical changes both the</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.870" end="00:04:16.770" style="s2">immediate ones and potentially the more</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.180" end="00:04:17.930" style="s2">abstract long-term ones that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.770" end="00:04:21.930" style="s2">facing</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.930" end="00:04:24.180" style="s2">so we could see that happening we could</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.930" end="00:04:25.680" style="s2">see as Peter mentioned people all</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.180" end="00:04:28.610" style="s2">expressing</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.680" end="00:04:31.470" style="s2">a tremendous amount of meaningfulness</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.610" end="00:04:33.320" style="s2">coming out and this could be due to a</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.470" end="00:04:36.810" style="s2">couple of things this could be due to</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.320" end="00:04:39.390" style="s2">just the urgency we could be dropping</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.810" end="00:04:42.270" style="s2">down Maslow&#39;s hierarchy of needs and</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.390" end="00:04:44.700" style="s2">we&#39;re actually really not dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.270" end="00:04:46.620" style="s2">meaning in life issues we&#39;re dealing</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.700" end="00:04:49.110" style="s2">with solving a lot of very concrete</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.620" end="00:04:51.510" style="s2">problems and so our problem-solving</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.110" end="00:04:53.550" style="s2">machinery is getting sort of current</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.510" end="00:04:55.620" style="s2">satisfaction that could be happening and</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.550" end="00:04:57.480" style="s2">that could be part of what I was</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.620" end="00:05:02.150" style="s2">alluding to when I mentioned to Peter we</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.480" end="00:05:05.250" style="s2">might be confusing urgency with meaning</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.150" end="00:05:07.440" style="s2">it could be that as people are being</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.250" end="00:05:09.180" style="s2">crunched downward and they&#39;re losing a</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.440" end="00:05:11.100" style="s2">lot of the things and this is more of a</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.180" end="00:05:14.040" style="s2">crooked Guardian point it kept us busy</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.100" end="00:05:17.100" style="s2">and distracted and in meshed in things</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.040" end="00:05:18.780" style="s2">that we thought would give us a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.100" end="00:05:21.150" style="s2">meaning and happiness we can we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.780" end="00:05:25.800" style="s2">discovered perhaps that we can lose a</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.150" end="00:05:27.570" style="s2">lot of this and we are forced into the</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.800" end="00:05:30.840" style="s2">interpersonal relationships which is</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.570" end="00:05:33.060" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing right now as being the</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.840" end="00:05:34.440" style="s2">locus where we&#39;re trying to satisfy our</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.060" end="00:05:36.420" style="s2">need for meaning we&#39;re finding that this</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.440" end="00:05:38.250" style="s2">is actually a better place to try and</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.420" end="00:05:40.200" style="s2">find meaning than the other things we</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.250" end="00:05:41.910" style="s2">were doing before so we could be</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.200" end="00:05:44.610" style="s2">experiencing an increased of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.910" end="00:05:48.360" style="s2">because of a recovery of the being mode</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.610" end="00:05:50.430" style="s2">that is actually present in dialogue we</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.360" end="00:05:54.570" style="s2">could be covering recovering meaning</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.430" end="00:06:00.330" style="s2">because we and I&#39;ve seen people doing</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.570" end="00:06:02.060" style="s2">this we fall into a kind of nostalgia a</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.330" end="00:06:05.730" style="s2">myth or what I might call a mythological</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.060" end="00:06:09.720" style="s2">nostalgia the the virus is kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.730" end="00:06:12.870" style="s2">you know a Greek or an Old Testament</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.720" end="00:06:16.020" style="s2">deity it&#39;s this pervasive ubiquitous</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.870" end="00:06:18.000" style="s2">thing out there chaotically sort of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.020" end="00:06:20.310" style="s2">like a hyper object use Morton&#39;s term</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.000" end="00:06:22.500" style="s2">moving through the world and just and</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.310" end="00:06:25.140" style="s2">changing and altering things but in an</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.500" end="00:06:27.600" style="s2">abstract way and behind the scenes and</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.140" end="00:06:29.610" style="s2">it seems to be demanding a purity code</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.600" end="00:06:31.380" style="s2">from us a tremendous purity code it</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.610" end="00:06:34.170" style="s2">feels a lot like an Old Testament deity</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.380" end="00:06:35.820" style="s2">and so that kind of nostalgia and let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.170" end="00:06:38.040" style="s2">not forget that this is deeply woven</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.820" end="00:06:38.849" style="s2">whether or not we&#39;re religious is deeply</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.040" end="00:06:41.240" style="s2">woven into our</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.849" end="00:06:44.159" style="s2">cognitive grammar so people might be</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.240" end="00:06:45.240" style="s2">picking up on that and finding the fact</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.159" end="00:06:47.819" style="s2">that they&#39;re in this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.240" end="00:06:49.259" style="s2">mythological narrative very meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.819" end="00:06:52.129" style="s2">to them</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.259" end="00:06:55.050" style="s2">people might be finding it meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.129" end="00:06:57.959" style="s2">precisely because they think this has</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.050" end="00:07:00.419" style="s2">provided the final evidence for the need</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.959" end="00:07:02.189" style="s2">for their particular pseudo religious</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.419" end="00:07:04.409" style="s2">ideological utopia which they are</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.189" end="00:07:06.509" style="s2">certain is on the horizon there and much</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.409" end="00:07:10.229" style="s2">like the people that Frankel talked</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.509" end="00:07:12.300" style="s2">about in in the camps who were certain</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.229" end="00:07:14.399" style="s2">of when they were going to be liberated</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.300" end="00:07:17.129" style="s2">and then they of course turned out to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.399" end="00:07:19.110" style="s2">the people once the date had passed they</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.129" end="00:07:21.209" style="s2">of course collapsed and often tried</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.110" end="00:07:24.719" style="s2">other people down with them so what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.209" end="00:07:27.240" style="s2">saying is I think it&#39;s more plausible</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.719" end="00:07:29.999" style="s2">and this is why I like the term Kairos</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.240" end="00:07:32.899" style="s2">that we&#39;re in a situation in which we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.999" end="00:07:36.029" style="s2">having a very complex set of reactions</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.899" end="00:07:38.360" style="s2">to what&#39;s happening right now I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.029" end="00:07:40.589" style="s2">some people are finding an exacerbation</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.360" end="00:07:43.259" style="s2">of the meeting crisis in ways that</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.589" end="00:07:45.269" style="s2">articulated I think people are maybe</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.259" end="00:07:47.759" style="s2">perhaps confusing meaning and urgency</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.269" end="00:07:50.159" style="s2">people might be recovering the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.759" end="00:07:51.659" style="s2">of the being mode in the as things get</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.159" end="00:07:54.539" style="s2">punched down to interpersonal dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.659" end="00:07:58.099" style="s2">people might be recovering meaning in a</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.539" end="00:08:02.430" style="s2">way that I think is dangerous because</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.099" end="00:08:04.379" style="s2">they are falling into a well-worn and</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.430" end="00:08:06.769" style="s2">well understood although not very</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.379" end="00:08:10.619" style="s2">explicitly in their consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.769" end="00:08:13.499" style="s2">explicitly aware mythological narrative</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.619" end="00:08:16.589" style="s2">of these kinds of mythological somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.499" end="00:08:19.229" style="s2">demonic forces at work in the world and</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.589" end="00:08:24.029" style="s2">so I think it&#39;s one of the things we</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.229" end="00:08:28.139" style="s2">need to do very carefully is question in</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.029" end="00:08:31.199" style="s2">a penetrative fashion what this what the</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.139" end="00:08:33.089" style="s2">what the various experiences of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.199" end="00:08:37.009" style="s2">increase or decrease in meaningfulness</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.089" end="00:08:41.250" style="s2">are and when we come to a better</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.009" end="00:08:45.149" style="s2">approximation of that complexity coming</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.250" end="00:08:47.760" style="s2">to a decision about how we can best</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.149" end="00:08:50.339" style="s2">interact with the car Ross because I do</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.760" end="00:08:52.320" style="s2">think that there is a real potential</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.339" end="00:08:56.220" style="s2">here because the Kairos content</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.320" end="00:08:57.600" style="s2">- towards the good or towards the evil I</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.220" end="00:09:00.090" style="s2">think there&#39;s a there&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.600" end="00:09:02.220" style="s2">opportunity here to see our cultural</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.090" end="00:09:03.510" style="s2">cognitive grammar shifting in a</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.220" end="00:09:05.910" style="s2">fundamental way I&#39;m not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.510" end="00:09:07.740" style="s2">saying it&#39;s gonna happen but I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.910" end="00:09:10.830" style="s2">there is the real potential for this to</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.740" end="00:09:13.320" style="s2">happen and I think there&#39;s a real need</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.830" end="00:09:14.760" style="s2">for this to happen because I think it is</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.320" end="00:09:17.970" style="s2">highly probable that this is not our</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.760" end="00:09:19.680" style="s2">last pandemic all of the factors that</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.970" end="00:09:21.360" style="s2">have caused this pandemic are still in</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.680" end="00:09:24.150" style="s2">existence then still growing this</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.360" end="00:09:26.040" style="s2">pandemic was predicted it has been</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.150" end="00:09:28.710" style="s2">predicted multiple times in the last</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.040" end="00:09:30.570" style="s2">decade and the factors upon which that</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.710" end="00:09:32.460" style="s2">successful prediction were made are</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.570" end="00:09:34.710" style="s2">still in existence and accelerating and</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.460" end="00:09:37.410" style="s2">I think it&#39;s highly likely that we will</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.710" end="00:09:40.170" style="s2">come into it and I do not think it will</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.410" end="00:09:42.210" style="s2">be a merely additive effect the second</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.170" end="00:09:45.030" style="s2">pandemic I think it will be an</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.210" end="00:09:49.170" style="s2">exponential effect on the way it shakes</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.030" end="00:09:51.450" style="s2">things up and causes sort of horrific</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.170" end="00:09:53.430" style="s2">exposure to the possibility of a</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.450" end="00:09:55.320" style="s2">fundamental training change in our</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.430" end="00:09:56.220" style="s2">worldview so that&#39;s my thinking right</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.320" end="00:09:59.670" style="s2">now and that&#39;s the kind of thing I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.220" end="00:10:03.090" style="s2">like to explore with you guys great so</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.670" end="00:10:04.560" style="s2">I&#39;ll warm drum up with some questions if</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.090" end="00:10:06.360" style="s2">you have questions you start writing in</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.560" end="00:10:09.300" style="s2">the chat box and then I&#39;ll call you up</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.360" end="00:10:12.240" style="s2">or read it on your behalf so my first</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.300" end="00:10:14.190" style="s2">question John so John and I have a</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.240" end="00:10:15.690" style="s2">regular circling practice and I only</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.190" end="00:10:18.030" style="s2">have spoke to you once and our practice</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.690" end="00:10:19.830" style="s2">kind of is on hold at the moment so just</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.030" end="00:10:23.010" style="s2">to get in like a really embodied state</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.830" end="00:10:24.540" style="s2">I&#39;m curious how since it started dawning</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.010" end="00:10:27.300" style="s2">on the collective unconscious that this</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.540" end="00:10:28.650" style="s2">is is going to be this is a big deal how</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.300" end="00:10:33.000" style="s2">did it affect you personally and in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.650" end="00:10:38.700" style="s2">body sense so that&#39;s very good very good</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.000" end="00:10:41.010" style="s2">question so part of the way that became</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.700" end="00:10:44.820" style="s2">very salient to me was the extra</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.010" end="00:10:47.220" style="s2">stressor on me so one and part of it is</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.820" end="00:10:47.970" style="s2">just my own sort of apprehension about</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.220" end="00:10:52.290" style="s2">what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.970" end="00:10:53.790" style="s2">part of it was picking up on the stress</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.290" end="00:10:56.250" style="s2">it was inducing in the people that I</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.790" end="00:11:01.710" style="s2">care a lot about because they faced real</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.250" end="00:11:05.460" style="s2">risk in important ways and part of it</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.710" end="00:11:05.950" style="s2">was also an existential issue because I</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.460" end="00:11:10.690" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.950" end="00:11:12.730" style="s2">struggling to understand how to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.690" end="00:11:14.440" style="s2">rational in the face of so much</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.730" end="00:11:17.140" style="s2">uncertainty and so much shifting</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.440" end="00:11:19.630" style="s2">information I was keenly aware of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.140" end="00:11:23.380" style="s2">fact that you know the representative</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.630" end="00:11:24.880" style="s2">bias and the confirmation bias and their</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.380" end="00:11:27.720" style="s2">you know and the availability heuristic</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.880" end="00:11:29.830" style="s2">we&#39;re kicking in and causing me to give</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.720" end="00:11:33.610" style="s2">wildly inappropriate judgments of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.830" end="00:11:37.810" style="s2">probability of things and and I was also</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.610" end="00:11:41.920" style="s2">aware of the fact that it was difficult</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.810" end="00:11:43.750" style="s2">for me to devote the time needed in</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.920" end="00:11:47.440" style="s2">order to determine the plausibility of</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.750" end="00:11:49.750" style="s2">some of the information I was given and</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.440" end="00:11:52.840" style="s2">I was also aware of the fact that this</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.750" end="00:11:55.030" style="s2">was not something for which I could</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.840" end="00:11:57.670" style="s2">merely sort of wait because of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.030" end="00:11:59.940" style="s2">urgency of the risk and my actions could</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.670" end="00:12:03.370" style="s2">definitely put other people at risk so</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.940" end="00:12:08.500" style="s2">my existential issue will as sort of in</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.370" end="00:12:10.900" style="s2">competition with the stressors and also</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.500" end="00:12:13.030" style="s2">the concern I have for the people that I</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.900" end="00:12:15.990" style="s2">care about and who are in my care and</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.030" end="00:12:19.390" style="s2">what that has resulted personally for me</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.990" end="00:12:23.650" style="s2">is an elevation of my Meniere&#39;s disease</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.390" end="00:12:27.700" style="s2">in my left ear which has been very</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.650" end="00:12:30.420" style="s2">troubling and trying for me and so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.700" end="00:12:33.940" style="s2">had to do quite a bit to moderate that</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.420" end="00:12:37.300" style="s2">and I&#39;ve also decided the way I can</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.940" end="00:12:39.610" style="s2">intake action is to take all of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.300" end="00:12:42.100" style="s2">reasonable precautions that are being</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.610" end="00:12:44.470" style="s2">advised to me from people I respect both</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.100" end="00:12:46.420" style="s2">personally because they have the rent of</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.470" end="00:12:48.070" style="s2">the requisite medical and health</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.420" end="00:12:50.470" style="s2">training and from the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.070" end="00:12:53.830" style="s2">community and then beyond that turn to</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.470" end="00:12:54.880" style="s2">what can I do to make a difference which</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.830" end="00:12:56.530" style="s2">is one of the reasons why I&#39;m here right</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.880" end="00:12:59.290" style="s2">now it&#39;s one of the reasons why I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.530" end="00:13:01.660" style="s2">started teaching my meditation course</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.290" end="00:13:04.450" style="s2">online for free I started that on Monday</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.660" end="00:13:06.130" style="s2">and it&#39;s phenomenologically what that</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.450" end="00:13:08.770" style="s2">has meant for me in terms of embodiment</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.130" end="00:13:11.350" style="s2">is my ability to take action in a way</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.770" end="00:13:12.850" style="s2">that I&#39;m being told by others is</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.350" end="00:13:15.640" style="s2">mattering to them and making a</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.850" end="00:13:18.090" style="s2">difference has significantly reduced my</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.640" end="00:13:21.810" style="s2">stress so</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.090" end="00:13:23.520" style="s2">and then I came to a decision point this</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.810" end="00:13:25.440" style="s2">came out in a discussion I had with</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.520" end="00:13:30.960" style="s2">Andrew Sweeney and Christopher master</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.440" end="00:13:34.680" style="s2">Pietro that in the end my survival my</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.960" end="00:13:36.990" style="s2">just raw bear survival they this is a I</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.680" end="00:13:39.390" style="s2">guess a Socratic principle is not worth</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.990" end="00:13:41.250" style="s2">sacrificing every other principle for</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.390" end="00:13:44.820" style="s2">which I live and so if it comes to a</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.250" end="00:13:48.090" style="s2">place where I have to expose myself to</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.820" end="00:13:50.580" style="s2">biological risk because principles that</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.090" end="00:13:52.440" style="s2">I very much care about are being put at</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.580" end="00:13:57.990" style="s2">risk then I&#39;ve decided that that&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.440" end="00:13:59.190" style="s2">fact what I will do and you and I we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.990" end="00:14:01.830" style="s2">been texting about this and I know</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.190" end="00:14:04.320" style="s2">Jordan you&#39;ve been talking about it how</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.830" end="00:14:06.300" style="s2">this could be a moment to ride liminal</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.320" end="00:14:09.420" style="s2">ride the wave of the liminal oh that</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.300" end="00:14:12.090" style="s2">well so so that&#39;s again and that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.420" end="00:14:12.960" style="s2">something that that&#39;s something maybe I</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.090" end="00:14:14.850" style="s2">should have brought it up in your</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.960" end="00:14:16.470" style="s2">previous question but it maybe it</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.850" end="00:14:17.670" style="s2">belongs here because this whole</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.470" end="00:14:19.380" style="s2">discussion that I&#39;ve been having with</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.670" end="00:14:21.570" style="s2">Jordan it sort of bridges between my</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.380" end="00:14:23.490" style="s2">personal phenomenology and a broader</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.570" end="00:14:26.940" style="s2">sort of theoretical interest which is</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.490" end="00:14:29.430" style="s2">this idea that Jordan and I have been</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.940" end="00:14:30.810" style="s2">exploring of course in one sense it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.430" end="00:14:31.950" style="s2">connected to the religion that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.810" end="00:14:34.140" style="s2">religion that we&#39;ve already been to</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.950" end="00:14:38.880" style="s2">talking about but it&#39;s also connected</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.140" end="00:14:40.770" style="s2">with giving people a formulation for a</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.880" end="00:14:42.840" style="s2">kind of deeper response to what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.770" end="00:14:46.560" style="s2">on here and this is an idea of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.840" end="00:14:47.880" style="s2">reformulate if I&#39;m not quite happy with</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.560" end="00:14:50.850" style="s2">the next adjective I&#39;m going to use but</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.880" end="00:14:53.220" style="s2">it&#39;s the best ones for right now try to</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.850" end="00:14:54.990" style="s2">reformulate a post religious sense of</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.220" end="00:14:57.540" style="s2">faith what I call Socratic faith and</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.990" end="00:15:00.330" style="s2">what does that look like and it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.540" end="00:15:03.810" style="s2">much this idea of shifting faith from</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.330" end="00:15:07.970" style="s2">some sort of closure and conviction arm</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.810" end="00:15:12.890" style="s2">in instead onto this idea of an ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.970" end="00:15:15.990" style="s2">um continuity of contact with an ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.890" end="00:15:21.510" style="s2">unfolding process within reality such</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.990" end="00:15:23.580" style="s2">that one is able to sense a Kairos when</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.510" end="00:15:29.070" style="s2">it&#39;s able to sense the course of events</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.580" end="00:15:31.200" style="s2">and one develops a always emerging</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.070" end="00:15:35.010" style="s2">always evolving finesse</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.200" end="00:15:36.870" style="s2">with how to steer one&#39;s way through that</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.010" end="00:15:38.610" style="s2">and so we are trying to come up with</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.870" end="00:15:41.190" style="s2">because this is of course exemplified in</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.610" end="00:15:44.250" style="s2">the Socratic dialogues the way Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.190" end="00:15:46.769" style="s2">is always you know a lover of wisdom in</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.250" end="00:15:49.380" style="s2">in on the course of wisdom but he never</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.769" end="00:15:51.660" style="s2">claims any kind of completion or closure</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.380" end="00:15:53.310" style="s2">upon it and you can see the way think</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.660" end="00:15:57.029" style="s2">he&#39;s willing to follow the argument</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.310" end="00:15:59.459" style="s2">wherever it goes and so that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.029" end="00:16:02.639" style="s2">faith I think is the kind of faith we</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.459" end="00:16:04.139" style="s2">need right now and I I&#39;m exploring it</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.639" end="00:16:06.600" style="s2">precisely because of what we talked</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.139" end="00:16:09.660" style="s2">about already earlier I&#39;m concerned</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.600" end="00:16:11.519" style="s2">about the kinds of faith that might be</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.660" end="00:16:14.310" style="s2">triggered right now obviously there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.519" end="00:16:17.910" style="s2">you know two kinds of nostalgic faith</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.310" end="00:16:21.230" style="s2">one is the faith in like I say the</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.910" end="00:16:24.420" style="s2">mythological God a demonic God out there</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.230" end="00:16:26.699" style="s2">another is a nostalgia for let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.420" end="00:16:28.829" style="s2">get back to normal as fast as we can</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.699" end="00:16:31.680" style="s2">let&#39;s just get back to normal as fast as</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.829" end="00:16:33.449" style="s2">we can and also the utopic faith the</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.680" end="00:16:35.820" style="s2">person who is convinced they have</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.449" end="00:16:38.010" style="s2">closure now because they have certainty</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.820" end="00:16:41.070" style="s2">as to where the future is going and how</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.010" end="00:16:44.490" style="s2">it&#39;s going to unfold and I think both of</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.070" end="00:16:47.130" style="s2">those kinds of faiths are potentially</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.490" end="00:16:49.500" style="s2">very maladaptive and so part of what</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.130" end="00:16:52.079" style="s2">I&#39;ve been trying to do is stitch</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.500" end="00:16:54.690" style="s2">together my own phenomenology in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.079" end="00:16:56.279" style="s2">distress that I&#39;ve been facing with that</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.690" end="00:16:58.709" style="s2">those theoretical concerns in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.279" end="00:16:59.790" style="s2">discussions but having with Jordan yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.709" end="00:17:01.829" style="s2">that&#39;s really really good</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.790" end="00:17:03.959" style="s2">and it seems like in his liminal space</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.829" end="00:17:05.459" style="s2">and as emerging culture wars happening</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.959" end="00:17:08.220" style="s2">with those narratives that you just</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.459" end="00:17:10.049" style="s2">mentioned yes yes you can already see it</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.220" end="00:17:11.250" style="s2">happening one of the things I was</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.049" end="00:17:12.569" style="s2">worried about in christen I&#39;ve spoken</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.250" end="00:17:15.360" style="s2">about this we&#39;ve already seen the</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.569" end="00:17:18.600" style="s2">emergence of conspiracy theories that</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.360" end="00:17:22.290" style="s2">are starting to gain traction as a way</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.600" end="00:17:24.809" style="s2">of of trying to explain as I and I you</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.290" end="00:17:27.089" style="s2">know I personally had one thrown at me I</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.809" end="00:17:29.220" style="s2">was I did a talk with Greg on reeks we</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.089" end="00:17:31.770" style="s2">just posted it and you know one person</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.220" end="00:17:33.540" style="s2">was basically you know the invective was</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.770" end="00:17:35.070" style="s2">that it&#39;s the intellectuals and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.540" end="00:17:37.080" style="s2">scientists and the theorists like me</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.070" end="00:17:40.320" style="s2">that have actually brought us into this</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.080" end="00:17:41.460" style="s2">situation right now and so oh it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.320" end="00:17:43.290" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.460" end="00:17:44.750" style="s2">that&#39;s very very dangerous that we start</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.290" end="00:17:51.240" style="s2">getting into this kind of conspiratorial</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.750" end="00:17:53.310" style="s2">narrative so I&#39;m gonna follow people to</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.240" end="00:17:54.840" style="s2">read out their questions again we have</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.310" end="00:17:57.150" style="s2">about 60 people on this chat so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.840" end="00:17:59.160" style="s2">not gonna get to all the questions and</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.150" end="00:18:00.750" style="s2">if you didn&#39;t indicate that you wanted</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.160" end="00:18:02.040" style="s2">me to read it out then just unmute</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.750" end="00:18:06.870" style="s2">yourself and then ask your question to</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.040" end="00:18:08.910" style="s2">John so the first question is Jordan you</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.870" end="00:18:10.740" style="s2">talked about a silver or silver lining</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.910" end="00:18:15.300" style="s2">if you can unmute yourself and just ask</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.740" end="00:18:17.430" style="s2">your question - John sure hey so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.300" end="00:18:19.470" style="s2">gonna quickly find it so my question is</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.430" end="00:18:21.360" style="s2">basically do you think although this is</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.470" end="00:18:22.890" style="s2">a bit of a chaotic statement but do you</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.360" end="00:18:27.900" style="s2">think there&#39;s somewhat of a silver</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.890" end="00:18:31.260" style="s2">lining in that the instant immediacy of</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.900" end="00:18:33.540" style="s2">everything that&#39;s happening relative to</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.260" end="00:18:35.670" style="s2">the ordinary sorts of concerns that</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.540" end="00:18:37.470" style="s2">we&#39;re being told to to be thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.670" end="00:18:40.110" style="s2">all the time for the media and so on</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.470" end="00:18:42.890" style="s2">maybe the silver lining is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.110" end="00:18:44.970" style="s2">somewhat of like a relief to people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.890" end="00:18:46.860" style="s2">consensus addiction or certainty</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.970" end="00:18:48.480" style="s2">addiction which i think is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.860" end="00:18:50.850" style="s2">things that really drives people to get</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.480" end="00:18:52.770" style="s2">attached to these old like legacy</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.850" end="00:18:55.260" style="s2">sense-making or like information</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.770" end="00:18:58.140" style="s2">laundering infrastructures right right</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.260" end="00:19:04.280" style="s2">right I think I think that&#39;s right I</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.140" end="00:19:07.230" style="s2">think the capacity for this to challenge</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.280" end="00:19:09.360" style="s2">the obvious Ness of common sense which</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.230" end="00:19:14.400" style="s2">how I would put what you&#39;re saying and</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.360" end="00:19:19.350" style="s2">the way that has been often raised to an</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.400" end="00:19:21.600" style="s2">almost sacred level in our discourse the</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.350" end="00:19:26.460" style="s2">way that&#39;s invoked and it&#39;s often a</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.600" end="00:19:28.830" style="s2">cover for as you said you know very well</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.460" end="00:19:30.990" style="s2">established ways of thinking of often</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.830" end="00:19:33.060" style="s2">also cover for very bias for the</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.990" end="00:19:35.340" style="s2">operation of bias and trying to protect</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.060" end="00:19:38.370" style="s2">it from any critical examination that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.340" end="00:19:43.110" style="s2">also at work I think the the virus has</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.370" end="00:19:45.630" style="s2">the the real I think it is doing this so</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.110" end="00:19:46.950" style="s2">it&#39;s more than the potential but it has</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.630" end="00:19:50.190" style="s2">an ongoing potential that&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.950" end="00:19:54.119" style="s2">actualized to challenge that that</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.190" end="00:19:55.859" style="s2">authority in a profound way and</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.119" end="00:19:57.409" style="s2">that in and of itself I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.859" end="00:19:59.609" style="s2">that in itself is a silver lining</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.409" end="00:20:01.319" style="s2">because it&#39;s like criticality in a</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.609" end="00:20:03.329" style="s2">system we&#39;re destabilizing the system</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.319" end="00:20:04.979" style="s2">and that of course is what I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.329" end="00:20:06.839" style="s2">get out with this Kairos it opens up</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.979" end="00:20:10.499" style="s2">possibilities but it opens up multiple</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.839" end="00:20:12.209" style="s2">possibilities so when people get their</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.499" end="00:20:14.879" style="s2">worldview challenged one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.209" end="00:20:17.339" style="s2">they can do is double down even so you</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.879" end="00:20:19.709" style="s2">know the you know the you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.339" end="00:20:21.659" style="s2">evidence of cults right so you have a</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.709" end="00:20:24.749" style="s2">cult and it will prophesy the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.659" end="00:20:26.099" style="s2">world and that that prophecy will gain a</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.749" end="00:20:28.439" style="s2">certain number of it adherents and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.099" end="00:20:30.059" style="s2">the prophecy fails and what you what you</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.439" end="00:20:33.059" style="s2">might expect is well that would cause</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.059" end="00:20:34.679" style="s2">the cult to bleed away but what actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.059" end="00:20:38.219" style="s2">happens is the cult doubles down and it</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.679" end="00:20:39.989" style="s2">expands in size the doubling down they</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.219" end="00:20:42.719" style="s2">say oh nobody were wrong and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.989" end="00:20:46.139" style="s2">weird phenomenon that people you&#39;d think</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.719" end="00:20:48.479" style="s2">that the failure would be enough to get</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.139" end="00:20:51.359" style="s2">people to abandon and reject but instead</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.479" end="00:20:52.709" style="s2">they double down and that doubling down</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.359" end="00:20:55.289" style="s2">gives them a kind of attractive</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.709" end="00:20:58.049" style="s2">confident confidence that sucks people</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.289" end="00:21:00.149" style="s2">in uh and so this in fact reliably</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.049" end="00:21:02.249" style="s2">happens it usually takes a third or a</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.149" end="00:21:03.569" style="s2">fourth failure for the for the movement</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.249" end="00:21:06.899" style="s2">to fall apart which is why I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.569" end="00:21:09.899" style="s2">well I think the next pandemic could be</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.899" end="00:21:11.969" style="s2">the really crunchy one now III don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.899" end="00:21:13.919" style="s2">have any foreknowledge of this it could</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.969" end="00:21:17.099" style="s2">go the way you&#39;re suggesting it could be</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.919" end="00:21:19.379" style="s2">just this wakes people up and they see</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.099" end="00:21:21.839" style="s2">the silver lining but like I said</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.379" end="00:21:23.399" style="s2">there&#39;s clear evidence for and I gave</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.839" end="00:21:26.099" style="s2">you some of it that people can go the</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.399" end="00:21:27.049" style="s2">other way and that&#39;s a concern for me</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.099" end="00:21:31.379" style="s2">hmm</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.049" end="00:21:41.369" style="s2">so Alex s you had a question about death</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.379" end="00:21:43.679" style="s2">and Kairos yeah can you guys hear me yep</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.369" end="00:21:48.809" style="s2">great thanks Peter and thanks John for</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.679" end="00:21:51.419" style="s2">uh for your talk I was wondering if you</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.809" end="00:21:54.089" style="s2">could talk a little bit about the</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.419" end="00:21:57.029" style="s2">meaning of Kairos and especially in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.089" end="00:21:59.219" style="s2">present moment and especially as it</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.029" end="00:22:00.959" style="s2">relates to the notion of death so</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.219" end="00:22:04.859" style="s2">currently we&#39;re in the situation where</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.959" end="00:22:08.010" style="s2">we&#39;re facing you know the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.859" end="00:22:10.020" style="s2">death is in view and if collectively</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.010" end="00:22:12.240" style="s2">also individually and we know the</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.020" end="00:22:14.400" style="s2">probabilities you know are different for</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.240" end="00:22:18.330" style="s2">different age groups and so on but that</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.400" end="00:22:20.460" style="s2">is kind of in the air yeah I think that</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.330" end="00:22:23.910" style="s2">in the existentialist tradition which</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.460" end="00:22:26.520" style="s2">remember kind of alluded to earlier that</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.910" end="00:22:28.650" style="s2">connection is drawn between you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.520" end="00:22:31.650" style="s2">kind of authentic existence and</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.650" end="00:22:33.480" style="s2">Heidegger potentially yeah yeah how many</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.650" end="00:22:37.320" style="s2">if you could say maybe more about that</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.480" end="00:22:39.570" style="s2">and especially as it relates to you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.320" end="00:22:41.400" style="s2">trying to have a more rational wise</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.570" end="00:22:46.560" style="s2">approach to the situation you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.400" end="00:22:48.300" style="s2">rather than going - yeah thanks that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.560" end="00:22:51.420" style="s2">great question and I want to answer to</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.300" end="00:22:52.530" style="s2">that and III think you&#39;re one of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.420" end="00:22:54.710" style="s2">things that&#39;s really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.530" end="00:22:58.170" style="s2">mr. does this and her book beyond fate</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.710" end="00:23:01.080" style="s2">and she actually holds out stoicism in</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.170" end="00:23:04.020" style="s2">connection with this because the we we</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.080" end="00:23:06.750" style="s2">have this word fatal and we accept we</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.020" end="00:23:08.970" style="s2">associated with death in particular but</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.750" end="00:23:12.180" style="s2">what we&#39;ve come to do is it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.970" end="00:23:14.070" style="s2">way we think of mad as being angry we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.180" end="00:23:15.060" style="s2">mad of course means losing your sanity</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.070" end="00:23:19.790" style="s2">and one of the things that could cause</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.060" end="00:23:21.810" style="s2">you to lose your sanity is your anger</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.790" end="00:23:26.310" style="s2">fatality originally meant the way</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.810" end="00:23:28.740" style="s2">reality muumuus of its own accord the</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.310" end="00:23:30.690" style="s2">hands of fate in that sense no not in</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.740" end="00:23:32.640" style="s2">some magical sense but in the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.690" end="00:23:34.290" style="s2">the universe is unfolding for things</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.640" end="00:23:36.320" style="s2">beyond our can and it will behave the</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.290" end="00:23:39.870" style="s2">way it&#39;s going to behave for its own</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.320" end="00:23:43.260" style="s2">reasons right and and and so death um</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.870" end="00:23:49.910" style="s2">was just one very significant instance</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.260" end="00:23:51.750" style="s2">of the fatality of all things that and</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.910" end="00:23:54.930" style="s2">visitor talks about the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.750" end="00:23:57.060" style="s2">stoicism tried to pull apart that by</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.930" end="00:23:58.950" style="s2">making a distinction between the things</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.060" end="00:24:01.320" style="s2">that are largely in the grip of nature</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.950" end="00:24:04.170" style="s2">and then the meaning we give them which</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.320" end="00:24:06.150" style="s2">has to do you know with our cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.170" end="00:24:09.180" style="s2">processing and our framing and pulling</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.150" end="00:24:13.590" style="s2">those apart she said was one of the you</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.180" end="00:24:17.790" style="s2">know the deepest ways of trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.590" end="00:24:19.770" style="s2">people to be able to accept the fatality</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.790" end="00:24:21.360" style="s2">of all things because the fatality</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.770" end="00:24:24.179" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.360" end="00:24:26.340" style="s2">points to a deep confusion between the</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.179" end="00:24:28.830" style="s2">meaning and the event now the</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.340" end="00:24:31.170" style="s2">interesting thing about that is you see</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.830" end="00:24:34.320" style="s2">of course this being taken up by both</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.170" end="00:24:39.000" style="s2">Nietzsche and Kierkegaard especially and</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.320" end="00:24:41.700" style="s2">the way in which I think we can stitch</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.000" end="00:24:43.620" style="s2">together this notion of fatality and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.700" end="00:24:46.470" style="s2">and the themes you brought out around</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.620" end="00:24:49.080" style="s2">things like authenticity is that um</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.470" end="00:24:51.090" style="s2">there&#39;s a way in which the fatality of</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.080" end="00:24:53.880" style="s2">all things is present with us always</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.090" end="00:24:55.470" style="s2">which is our mortality and our mortality</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.880" end="00:24:58.049" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean the event of our death it</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.470" end="00:25:00.720" style="s2">means that like everything else we are</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.049" end="00:25:02.640" style="s2">deep even our own bodies and you see</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.720" end="00:25:04.380" style="s2">this in stoicism right even our own</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.640" end="00:25:07.320" style="s2">bodies are subject to that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.380" end="00:25:10.169" style="s2">fatality that&#39;s what the virus can show</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.320" end="00:25:12.780" style="s2">we think we&#39;ve made health into a God</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.169" end="00:25:16.080" style="s2">and we are the masters of our health</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.780" end="00:25:18.360" style="s2">well no we&#39;re not no or not right I mean</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.080" end="00:25:20.520" style="s2">we can make we can move things around</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.360" end="00:25:22.200" style="s2">and we can share probabilities but</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.520" end="00:25:25.080" style="s2">whatever narrative we have for ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.200" end="00:25:28.620" style="s2">in our bodies the the universe is going</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.080" end="00:25:32.730" style="s2">to unfold in our bodies independently of</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.620" end="00:25:35.070" style="s2">that narrative so the are the we can we</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.730" end="00:25:36.720" style="s2">can deal with the one of the first and</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.070" end="00:25:39.240" style="s2">primary ways we have to deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.720" end="00:25:41.640" style="s2">fatality of all things is we have to</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.240" end="00:25:44.790" style="s2">deal with it insofar as our own bodies</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.640" end="00:25:46.530" style="s2">our own fame our own status which is our</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.790" end="00:25:47.790" style="s2">mortality which is different than just</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.530" end="00:25:49.620" style="s2">the event of our death</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.790" end="00:25:53.280" style="s2">and I think one of the things that the</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.620" end="00:25:55.919" style="s2">virus can potentially do for us is make</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.280" end="00:25:58.950" style="s2">us step back and become mortals again</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.919" end="00:26:01.799" style="s2">which is a very different project than</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.950" end="00:26:04.440" style="s2">what we have tried to be for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.799" end="00:26:08.429" style="s2">through the way we manipulate media and</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.440" end="00:26:09.840" style="s2">image which is we behave it act as if</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.429" end="00:26:12.570" style="s2">we&#39;re immortal and then when it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.840" end="00:26:15.480" style="s2">clear that we are in fact mortal we are</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.570" end="00:26:18.780" style="s2">we are disenfranchised packaged away</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.480" end="00:26:21.690" style="s2">removed from media you know etc etc and</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.780" end="00:26:24.150" style="s2">I think instead if we could come to a</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.690" end="00:26:26.820" style="s2">place where we can reimburse our</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.150" end="00:26:29.460" style="s2">mortality I think that would be a good</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.820" end="00:26:31.860" style="s2">way for extending the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.460" end="00:26:34.800" style="s2">authenticity off of just being true to</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.860" end="00:26:35.190" style="s2">oneself which i think is a very poor</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.800" end="00:26:37.860" style="s2">frame</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.190" end="00:26:40.710" style="s2">authenticity and get it getting it back</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.860" end="00:26:43.380" style="s2">to living with the fatality of all</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.710" end="00:26:45.720" style="s2">things in as rational a manner as</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.380" end="00:26:49.170" style="s2">possible that&#39;s how I would answer that</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.720" end="00:26:51.000" style="s2">question I jump in with it just a quick</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.170" end="00:26:53.460" style="s2">follow-up please please</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.000" end="00:26:56.100" style="s2">so I&#39;m wondering that would you would</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.460" end="00:26:57.870" style="s2">you align the existential tradition more</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.100" end="00:27:00.840" style="s2">or less with stoicism I don&#39;t need your</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.870" end="00:27:04.230" style="s2">son always stoic yeah well yes and no</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.840" end="00:27:06.600" style="s2">because you know the Nietzsche&#39;s deeply</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.230" end="00:27:09.690" style="s2">influenced by stoicism and you know in</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.600" end="00:27:12.300" style="s2">kirkegaard writes his PhD dissertation</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.690" end="00:27:16.080" style="s2">on Socrates so there&#39;s obviously at</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.300" end="00:27:17.910" style="s2">least a deep Socratic influence in</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.080" end="00:27:20.010" style="s2">crypto garden so both of the you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.910" end="00:27:22.740" style="s2">the godfathers of existentialism I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.010" end="00:27:25.910" style="s2">are deeply influenced by this current</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.740" end="00:27:30.260" style="s2">however I would not I would not identify</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.910" end="00:27:36.390" style="s2">stoicism with existentialism because</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.260" end="00:27:39.270" style="s2">existentialism I think and I&#39;m sorry I</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.390" end="00:27:40.950" style="s2">mean the posts are trian sense of</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.270" end="00:27:42.330" style="s2">existentialism not what&#39;s going on in</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.950" end="00:27:44.400" style="s2">Heidegger because Heidegger is a</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.330" end="00:27:45.690" style="s2">different thing Heidegger is you know we</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.400" end="00:27:47.220" style="s2">are the beings whose being is in</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.690" end="00:27:50.850" style="s2">question that&#39;s a that&#39;s a different</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.220" end="00:27:53.370" style="s2">thing but the the the the the strand it</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.850" end="00:27:55.440" style="s2">comes out later at least one strand of</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.370" end="00:28:01.980" style="s2">existentialism that sort of became more</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.440" end="00:28:03.480" style="s2">prominent was the idea you know that you</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.980" end="00:28:05.220" style="s2">know that our existence precedes our</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.480" end="00:28:07.620" style="s2">essence because we are the creatures who</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.220" end="00:28:09.360" style="s2">completely decided our essence so</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.620" end="00:28:11.790" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a shift from Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.360" end="00:28:13.710" style="s2">from us being the beings whose being is</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.790" end="00:28:18.420" style="s2">in question to us being the self</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.710" end="00:28:21.060" style="s2">defining beings and stoicism I think is</p>

<p begin="00:29:22.679" end="00:29:26.760" style="s2">mentioned conspiracies but I&#39;m wondering</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.660" end="00:29:29.850" style="s2">how we can as regular people relate to</p>

<p begin="00:29:36.120" end="00:29:45.600" style="s2">players Hollywood actors yep so this is</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.429" end="00:29:46.530" style="s2">always the the trick around this sorry I</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.600" end="00:29:48.059" style="s2">didn&#39;t mean trick in the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.530" end="00:29:50.120" style="s2">deception I&#39;m in it in the sense of them</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.059" end="00:29:57.470" style="s2">you know the the the the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.120" end="00:30:00.120" style="s2">requires finesse so how do you identify</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.470" end="00:30:05.730" style="s2">how do you distinguish identifying bona</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.120" end="00:30:08.550" style="s2">fide socio-economic let&#39;s use that as a</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.730" end="00:30:11.580" style="s2">broad socio political socio-economic in</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.550" end="00:30:13.970" style="s2">justices unfairness how do you</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.580" end="00:30:21.929" style="s2">distinguish them from conspiratorial</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.970" end="00:30:24.150" style="s2">thinking and and I guess the idea well</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.929" end="00:30:26.190" style="s2">this is what I do I have a heuristic is</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.150" end="00:30:30.179" style="s2">that I don&#39;t believe in in conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.190" end="00:30:33.120" style="s2">theories until I get you know evidence</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.179" end="00:30:34.950" style="s2">of them that&#39;s as good as any scientific</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.120" end="00:30:35.640" style="s2">theory or beliefs moves in that</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.950" end="00:30:39.390" style="s2">direction</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.640" end="00:30:42.660" style="s2">so if you get here you know if you get</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.390" end="00:30:44.309" style="s2">undisputed evidence that people have</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.660" end="00:30:46.650" style="s2">this kind of access which i think is</p>

<p begin="00:30:47.370" end="00:30:52.350" style="s2">there&#39;s no plausible alternative</p>

<p begin="00:31:03.630" end="00:31:12.000" style="s2">then I think that&#39;s how you sort of make</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.390" end="00:31:14.280" style="s2">the decision so maybe I&#39;m what in fact</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.000" end="00:31:16.890" style="s2">proposing is we reserved the term</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.280" end="00:31:20.330" style="s2">conspiracy theory for something that</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.890" end="00:31:23.220" style="s2">gains its exceptions</p>

<p begin="00:31:23.220" end="00:31:29.340" style="s2">conspiracy that makes sense of what is</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.490" end="00:31:30.990" style="s2">otherwise chaotic whereas coming to a</p>

<p begin="00:31:30.990" end="00:31:36.030" style="s2">argumentation that&#39;s convergent are they</p>

<p begin="00:31:46.020" end="00:31:49.920" style="s2">think we should say no we should say</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.510" end="00:31:52.260" style="s2">what it is we have good evidence that</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.920" end="00:31:55.110" style="s2">people are acting unjustly and that they</p>

<p begin="00:32:07.950" end="00:32:10.490" style="s2">I would say to that</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.330" end="00:32:17.590" style="s2">so I&#39;m going to read this on behalf of</p>

<p begin="00:35:51.880" end="00:35:55.750" style="s2">sense where that turn in and participate</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.950" end="00:35:59.230" style="s2">in it are the turning of events yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.750" end="00:36:04.450" style="s2">yeah but I have the impression that at</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.230" end="00:36:08.109" style="s2">least I mean for our society it is this</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.450" end="00:36:10.990" style="s2">is if moment not by itself not because</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.109" end="00:36:13.059" style="s2">as you said it is just appending me we</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.990" end="00:36:17.049" style="s2">can say it&#39;s a small one there are gonna</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.059" end="00:36:20.799" style="s2">be many others but we are now in a</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.049" end="00:36:23.020" style="s2">synchronicity of so many crises that we</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.799" end="00:36:27.099" style="s2">have been kicking the can down the road</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.020" end="00:36:29.680" style="s2">that this is like the drop that is that</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.099" end="00:36:32.650" style="s2">is you&#39;re feeling the jar you know and</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.680" end="00:36:37.270" style="s2">also I would say that the</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.650" end="00:36:40.930" style="s2">the urgency thing is that it&#39;s too fast</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.270" end="00:36:44.110" style="s2">to build wisdom at this time for two</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.930" end="00:36:47.500" style="s2">reason first it&#39;s because we&#39;re living</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.110" end="00:36:50.200" style="s2">it in in life like with so many</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.500" end="00:36:53.170" style="s2">information and it goes so quick so you</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.200" end="00:36:56.290" style="s2">have this reciprocal narrowing were you</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.170" end="00:36:58.810" style="s2">just going time from time and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.290" end="00:37:04.840" style="s2">take the step back to see the big</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.810" end="00:37:08.320" style="s2">picture of the meta-crisis and also so</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.840" end="00:37:11.860" style="s2">so yeah I just leave it there and I let</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.320" end="00:37:15.730" style="s2">you comment because I see it as as a</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.860" end="00:37:18.940" style="s2">Kairos at least for for our time in our</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.730" end="00:37:20.740" style="s2">and my generation so thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.940" end="00:37:23.800" style="s2">explaining it because I have a better</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.740" end="00:37:27.490" style="s2">understanding and yeah I don&#39;t I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.800" end="00:37:32.200" style="s2">think the I agree with you and if I</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.490" end="00:37:34.930" style="s2">presented it as otherwise I apologize</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.200" end="00:37:37.360" style="s2">because I might have been misleading I</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.930" end="00:37:40.080" style="s2">agree with you that I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.360" end="00:37:43.030" style="s2">synchronicity not to use near term</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.080" end="00:37:45.660" style="s2">between this particular biological</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.030" end="00:37:47.920" style="s2">crisis and the already existing</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.660" end="00:37:49.840" style="s2">meta-crisis I think you&#39;re right and I</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.920" end="00:37:51.550" style="s2">think it&#39;s in in that sense it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.840" end="00:37:53.500" style="s2">Kairos in the sense of also being a</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.550" end="00:37:55.720" style="s2">tipping point and here I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.500" end="00:37:57.190" style="s2">like in dynamical systems where you can</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.720" end="00:38:00.160" style="s2">perturb a system for a very long time</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.190" end="00:38:02.350" style="s2">and it can it can adaptively restructure</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.160" end="00:38:04.510" style="s2">but when the perturbations get too great</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.350" end="00:38:06.790" style="s2">it becomes critical and it starts to</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.510" end="00:38:09.430" style="s2">break and then that criticality is a</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.790" end="00:38:11.320" style="s2">real opportunity in a sense it because</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.430" end="00:38:14.170" style="s2">it can go one of two ways the system can</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.320" end="00:38:16.330" style="s2">collapse or that criticality actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.170" end="00:38:18.130" style="s2">breaks the structure up enough that a</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.330" end="00:38:22.230" style="s2">new structure can emerge out of it and</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.130" end="00:38:26.080" style="s2">so it I agree that I think the virus is</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.230" end="00:38:27.850" style="s2">in that sense it&#39;s it&#39;s sort of a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.080" end="00:38:29.590" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s the you know the proverbial</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.850" end="00:38:34.690" style="s2">straw that&#39;s breaking the already</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.590" end="00:38:36.720" style="s2">overburdened camel&#39;s back the the idea</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.690" end="00:38:40.960" style="s2">about the urgency because it&#39;s very hard</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.720" end="00:38:43.510" style="s2">to cultivate wisdom right now I</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.960" end="00:38:45.100" style="s2">understand yeah it&#39;s very difficult for</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.510" end="00:38:46.319" style="s2">people to engage in the practices and</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.100" end="00:38:48.990" style="s2">therefore</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.319" end="00:38:51.960" style="s2">giving in to kind of urgent short-term</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.990" end="00:38:54.089" style="s2">scarcity thinking is going to come very</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.960" end="00:38:55.559" style="s2">naturally and so it&#39;s I think it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.089" end="00:38:57.809" style="s2">to be a very significant challenge as</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.559" end="00:39:01.079" style="s2">you said to get people to step back and</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.809" end="00:39:03.329" style="s2">see the bigger picture I here&#39;s where a</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.079" end="00:39:04.980" style="s2">lot of you know a lot of practices a lot</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.329" end="00:39:08.220" style="s2">of psycho technological practices are</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.980" end="00:39:10.230" style="s2">really important people a way to do this</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.220" end="00:39:11.760" style="s2">without having to argue at great length</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.230" end="00:39:13.319" style="s2">with people and we already have</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.760" end="00:39:15.150" style="s2">independent evidence from this control</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.319" end="00:39:17.040" style="s2">level theory is to get at them</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.150" end="00:39:19.290" style="s2">practicing things like the stoic view</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.040" end="00:39:21.059" style="s2">from above that transformation of</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.290" end="00:39:24.180" style="s2">perspective all knowing really does have</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.059" end="00:39:26.550" style="s2">a huge impact on people&#39;s propositional</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.180" end="00:39:29.550" style="s2">and inferential thinking and it also</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.550" end="00:39:31.589" style="s2">opens them up to a kind of reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.550" end="00:39:33.000" style="s2">opening it opens them up to a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.589" end="00:39:36.690" style="s2">wonder in which they&#39;re willing to call</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.000" end="00:39:38.369" style="s2">their worldview and their sense of</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.690" end="00:39:41.369" style="s2">identity into question precisely because</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.369" end="00:39:43.619" style="s2">of the way the practice alters what is</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.369" end="00:39:45.619" style="s2">normally an unchallenged salience</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.619" end="00:39:49.200" style="s2">landscape in which their own particular</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.619" end="00:39:51.210" style="s2">urgent narrative is super salient and</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.200" end="00:39:53.609" style="s2">blinding them to the bigger picture now</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.210" end="00:39:55.349" style="s2">you understand I&#39;m not prophesying that</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.609" end="00:39:56.790" style="s2">this is going to spread you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.349" end="00:39:59.010" style="s2">throughout the culture or anything like</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.790" end="00:40:01.260" style="s2">that but what I&#39;m saying is there are</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.010" end="00:40:03.540" style="s2">things we can offer people even in their</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.260" end="00:40:06.329" style="s2">urgency that are designed to work right</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.540" end="00:40:09.480" style="s2">now in the urgency and can ultimately be</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.329" end="00:40:14.309" style="s2">made conducive to and coherent with much</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.480" end="00:40:14.670" style="s2">more long-term rational processes thank</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.309" end="00:40:16.559" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.670" end="00:40:18.960" style="s2">thank you that was an excellent question</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.559" end="00:40:21.059" style="s2">and thank you for for explaining it to</p>

<p begin="00:40:52.920" end="00:40:57.330" style="s2">pandemic is prompting a lot of us to</p>

<p begin="00:40:57.330" end="00:41:00.540" style="s2">to skip around to different philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.160" end="00:41:02.490" style="s2">meetup groups really easily that have</p>

<p begin="00:41:22.500" end="00:41:27.240" style="s2">will gain traction might it be something</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.140" end="00:41:29.520" style="s2">that is primarily an online phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.240" end="00:41:31.320" style="s2">like that almost like a digital Church</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.520" end="00:41:33.990" style="s2">or it&#39;s not thirty I can&#39;t really see</p>

<p begin="00:41:43.430" end="00:41:49.440" style="s2">I think that I think that&#39;s right Minoo</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.270" end="00:41:52.109" style="s2">and Jordans been talking about that</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.440" end="00:41:53.400" style="s2">Jordan Hall and he&#39;s perhaps the person</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.109" end="00:41:57.180" style="s2">to talk a little bit more about he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.400" end="00:42:00.330" style="s2">talking about not only the the way the</p>

<p begin="00:42:00.330" end="00:42:03.839" style="s2">talking about the fact that you know we</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.310" end="00:42:05.580" style="s2">might be able to get it to integrate</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.839" end="00:42:07.230" style="s2">with some machine learning to really</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.580" end="00:42:09.420" style="s2">optimize the way in which we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.230" end="00:42:10.830" style="s2">connecting and the way we commit some of</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.420" end="00:42:13.740" style="s2">the connections can be made outside of</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.830" end="00:42:15.510" style="s2">sort of individual cognition and so I</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.740" end="00:42:16.980" style="s2">think there&#39;s a tremendous potential for</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.510" end="00:42:19.320" style="s2">the technology I would like I would like</p>

<p begin="00:42:19.320" end="00:42:24.630" style="s2">connected to your question and</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.599" end="00:42:26.940" style="s2">strengthens your point and this came up</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.630" end="00:42:30.119" style="s2">with somebody was talking it was just</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.940" end="00:42:32.580" style="s2">you know doing an online wisdom lecture</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.119" end="00:42:36.750" style="s2">for web of wisdom and this came up sort</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.580" end="00:42:38.910" style="s2">of this issue about that this technology</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.750" end="00:42:40.589" style="s2">does something there there it brings</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.910" end="00:42:42.540" style="s2">with it a phenomenological difference</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.589" end="00:42:44.820" style="s2">that is actually really important with</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.540" end="00:42:46.200" style="s2">and here&#39;s a couple of phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.820" end="00:42:48.180" style="s2">features that came up in the discussion</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.200" end="00:42:50.640" style="s2">I was having with this person notice how</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.180" end="00:42:53.430" style="s2">close your face is in terms of the size</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.640" end="00:42:55.710" style="s2">it fit it fills on my visual field and</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.430" end="00:42:57.240" style="s2">yet normally if I was that close to you</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.710" end="00:42:59.610" style="s2">and you mean you and I just met</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.240" end="00:43:01.590" style="s2">would be like oh but it&#39;s okay in this</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.610" end="00:43:03.330" style="s2">medium it&#39;s part of the grammar and so</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.590" end="00:43:06.180" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s this right there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.330" end="00:43:08.369" style="s2">kind of a phenomenological intimacy</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.180" end="00:43:11.280" style="s2">notice that also we&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.369" end="00:43:12.750" style="s2">equidistant from each other because we</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.280" end="00:43:15.150" style="s2">you know because we&#39;re not actually</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.750" end="00:43:17.040" style="s2">spatially oriented we&#39;re and we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.150" end="00:43:19.710" style="s2">this digital space where everybody sort</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.040" end="00:43:21.300" style="s2">of has equal access and that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.710" end="00:43:23.760" style="s2">really interesting phenomena because it</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.300" end="00:43:26.010" style="s2">also right removes a lot of the typical</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.760" end="00:43:28.920" style="s2">ways in which people are marking</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.010" end="00:43:31.140" style="s2">identity and status by their spatial</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.920" end="00:43:33.060" style="s2">positioning that sort of removed and</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.140" end="00:43:37.500" style="s2">it&#39;s put into the background in a deep</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.060" end="00:43:41.160" style="s2">way now I was talking about that either</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.500" end="00:43:42.600" style="s2">way this really enhances the this</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.160" end="00:43:44.550" style="s2">technology it&#39;s not only what I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.600" end="00:43:46.380" style="s2">to say it&#39;s not only the way the</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.550" end="00:43:49.410" style="s2">technology furthers the communication</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.380" end="00:43:50.760" style="s2">gives us access it&#39;s also transform it</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.410" end="00:43:52.170" style="s2">in it&#39;s also transforming a</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.760" end="00:43:55.680" style="s2">phenomenological experience in a</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.170" end="00:43:57.090" style="s2">profound way and I think I suggested to</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.680" end="00:43:59.670" style="s2">her that&#39;s only a suggestion I&#39;m making</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.090" end="00:44:01.950" style="s2">to you but I think it&#39;s the only thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.670" end="00:44:03.960" style="s2">that&#39;s analogous to us and people are</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.950" end="00:44:06.210" style="s2">also but we&#39;re also doing this before</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.960" end="00:44:07.980" style="s2">the crisis in our heritage is people</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.210" end="00:44:09.750" style="s2">sitting around a campfire because when</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.980" end="00:44:12.119" style="s2">people are circling around the campfire</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.750" end="00:44:14.640" style="s2">they sort of have that circular distance</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.119" end="00:44:16.470" style="s2">from each other and because of the way</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.640" end="00:44:19.200" style="s2">campfires their faces tend to be very</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.470" end="00:44:21.000" style="s2">well lit and they all are oriented and</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.200" end="00:44:22.710" style="s2">Matt Rossano actually talks about that</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.000" end="00:44:24.750" style="s2">in Supernatural selection how that</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.710" end="00:44:26.880" style="s2">really probably drove our cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.750" end="00:44:29.190" style="s2">evolution a very powerful way because</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.880" end="00:44:31.470" style="s2">we&#39;ve had fire across several species in</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.190" end="00:44:34.380" style="s2">a drove working memory it drove our</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.470" end="00:44:35.609" style="s2">orientation it probably he said we said</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.380" end="00:44:38.220" style="s2">we probably gained the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.609" end="00:44:40.530" style="s2">meditate from sort of sharing the focus</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.220" end="00:44:43.050" style="s2">of the fire and then looking up in this</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.530" end="00:44:46.230" style="s2">intimate fashion to people&#39;s faces so I</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.050" end="00:44:48.359" style="s2">think we&#39;re doing virtual camp firing or</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.230" end="00:44:51.810" style="s2">something like it right here right now</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.359" end="00:44:54.240" style="s2">and so it&#39;s not just sort of the the the</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.810" end="00:44:56.640" style="s2">increased power of communication and</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.240" end="00:44:58.170" style="s2">connection I think the medium also has</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.640" end="00:45:01.020" style="s2">the potential if properly used</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.170" end="00:45:03.420" style="s2">artistically and dialogic Lee to really</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.020" end="00:45:05.660" style="s2">tap in to that phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.420" end="00:45:10.080" style="s2">difference and that primordial right</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.660" end="00:45:11.250" style="s2">association and greatly empower what</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.080" end="00:45:13.680" style="s2">you&#39;re suggesting</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.250" end="00:45:14.760" style="s2">the ability for people find something</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.680" end="00:45:16.380" style="s2">more like a church because I think</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.760" end="00:45:18.270" style="s2">before there were ever any churches</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.380" end="00:45:21.030" style="s2">there was the religio around the</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.270" end="00:45:22.760" style="s2">campfire for several species and for</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.030" end="00:45:25.170" style="s2">hundreds of thousands of years</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.760" end="00:45:27.060" style="s2">hmm thank you I just want to add</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.170" end="00:45:29.150" style="s2">something I noticed with I have a meetup</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.060" end="00:45:31.980" style="s2">group and we meet every two weeks and</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.150" end="00:45:34.080" style="s2">going to zoom has actually greatly</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.980" end="00:45:35.880" style="s2">improved our ability to have a meeting</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.080" end="00:45:37.560" style="s2">in a way that surprised me because I</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.880" end="00:45:39.450" style="s2">would have thought you opposite I was</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.560" end="00:45:41.820" style="s2">like zooms not gonna work but everything</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.450" end="00:45:43.950" style="s2">seems much easier it flows this better</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.820" end="00:45:46.290" style="s2">way we&#39;re kind of jamming it is better</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.950" end="00:45:49.230" style="s2">the way yes I think it&#39;s a campfire</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.290" end="00:45:51.330" style="s2">effect yeah I think I really do I&#39;m sort</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.230" end="00:45:55.320" style="s2">of trying to sort of coin that the</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.330" end="00:45:58.260" style="s2">virtual campfire effect and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.320" end="00:46:00.630" style="s2">interesting is the contrast to online</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.260" end="00:46:04.440" style="s2">teaching where that&#39;s normally met like</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.630" end="00:46:06.660" style="s2">online lecturing so pretty clearly the</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.440" end="00:46:09.060" style="s2">evidence shows that if you go to like an</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.660" end="00:46:11.250" style="s2">online university you don&#39;t get as good</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.060" end="00:46:14.280" style="s2">an education as if you do it in person</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.250" end="00:46:16.590" style="s2">so it I don&#39;t have anything to say about</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.280" end="00:46:18.450" style="s2">that I just want it was a note that</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.590" end="00:46:20.670" style="s2">because I agree with you when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.450" end="00:46:24.290" style="s2">doing this dialogic thing we seem to</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.670" end="00:46:27.120" style="s2">find this this virtual stuff enhances</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.290" end="00:46:28.590" style="s2">enhances the process but when we&#39;re into</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.120" end="00:46:30.750" style="s2">sort of the dissemination the</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.590" end="00:46:34.560" style="s2">traditional dissemination of information</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.750" end="00:46:37.500" style="s2">in sort of you know a propositional</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.560" end="00:46:39.140" style="s2">largely propositional format you seem to</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.500" end="00:46:43.520" style="s2">you seem to find a significant</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.140" end="00:46:46.560" style="s2">degradation in what people get from it</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.520" end="00:46:50.460" style="s2">okay thank you John your hero keep it up</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.560" end="00:46:57.030" style="s2">thank you for your encouragement yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.460" end="00:47:00.060" style="s2">Dan Feldman you had a question yes I had</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.030" end="00:47:02.760" style="s2">a question our first first professor</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.060" end="00:47:05.040" style="s2">fare-bear by aki bareback ii i really</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.760" end="00:47:06.900" style="s2">enjoyed your series and it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.040" end="00:47:08.910" style="s2">inspired me to create my own my own</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.900" end="00:47:12.390" style="s2">series that i&#39;m thinking about doing</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.910" end="00:47:16.760" style="s2">call me done please come John a you John</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.390" end="00:47:19.740" style="s2">yes yeah yeah basically just transition</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.760" end="00:47:24.380" style="s2">awakening from the system systemic</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.740" end="00:47:27.920" style="s2">inertia is something so my question is</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.380" end="00:47:30.230" style="s2">what I&#39;m an American so what can we do</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.920" end="00:47:32.329" style="s2">and and other people in similar</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.230" end="00:47:34.190" style="s2">situations what can we do to ensure that</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.329" end="00:47:38.420" style="s2">the ideas and practices that are</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.190" end="00:47:41.000" style="s2">selected in response to this Kairos move</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.420" end="00:47:44.450" style="s2">into a wise and regenerative direction</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.000" end="00:47:46.640" style="s2">of reciprocal opening yeah and not into</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.450" end="00:47:48.559" style="s2">an ignorant and extractive direction a</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.640" end="00:47:50.690" style="s2">reciprocal narrowing in light of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.559" end="00:47:52.700" style="s2">fact that the techno managerial elites</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.690" end="00:47:54.849" style="s2">and power are coming forward with a</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.700" end="00:47:57.559" style="s2">doubling down a further privatization</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.849" end="00:48:00.470" style="s2">austerity yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.559" end="00:48:02.000" style="s2">and because there&#39;s a there&#39;s a bailing</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.470" end="00:48:05.329" style="s2">out they&#39;re moving to a bailing out of</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.000" end="00:48:10.400" style="s2">the corporations and not to some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.329" end="00:48:12.380" style="s2">ubi or or to helping out the spreading</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.400" end="00:48:16.279" style="s2">precariat and the small businesses and</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.380" end="00:48:18.049" style="s2">such yeah sorry I just I&#39;m just yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.279" end="00:48:20.900" style="s2">just like yes everything you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.049" end="00:48:24.079" style="s2">and I this a similar thing came up in</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.900" end="00:48:25.819" style="s2">the rebel wisdom thing it came up in a</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.079" end="00:48:27.680" style="s2">really interesting way because I was</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.819" end="00:48:28.759" style="s2">posed a question and it was an honest</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.680" end="00:48:32.269" style="s2">question it wasn&#39;t somebody being</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.759" end="00:48:34.880" style="s2">manipulative or anything and they</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.269" end="00:48:37.579" style="s2">basically said well you know who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.880" end="00:48:42.220" style="s2">approached you have you been approached</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.579" end="00:48:47.299" style="s2">by any of the you know the power holders</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.220" end="00:48:49.339" style="s2">about any of it you know and I thought</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.299" end="00:48:51.769" style="s2">about it I thought no not a single one</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.339" end="00:48:53.990" style="s2">I&#39;ve not been approached by any of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.769" end="00:48:55.279" style="s2">people that will power I&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.990" end="00:48:58.269" style="s2">that the Prime Minister should call me I</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.279" end="00:49:01.039" style="s2">mean me or the people I&#39;m talking with I</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.269" end="00:49:03.049" style="s2">don&#39;t know of anybody that&#39;s been a pro</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.039" end="00:49:04.759" style="s2">now are lots of other people approach</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.049" end="00:49:08.210" style="s2">well here we are here&#39;s your answer</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.759" end="00:49:09.890" style="s2">like I I am busier now than I was when I</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.210" end="00:49:11.420" style="s2">was you know going into work at the</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.890" end="00:49:13.160" style="s2">university more and more people are</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.420" end="00:49:16.730" style="s2">reaching out more and more people like</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.160" end="00:49:19.430" style="s2">so the bottom up is Titanic overwhelming</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.730" end="00:49:21.890" style="s2">and the fact and this is why I&#39;m worried</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.430" end="00:49:23.539" style="s2">about the Kairos right and why I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:54:54.119" end="00:54:58.170" style="s2">coming and trying to come up with a post</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.369" end="00:55:02.099" style="s2">religious faith because here&#39;s the idea</p>

<p begin="00:55:02.099" end="00:55:07.410" style="s2">want to do what like Augustine did as</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.830" end="00:55:09.420" style="s2">the Roman Empire is falling he laid the</p>

<p begin="00:55:09.420" end="00:55:14.880" style="s2">not saying I&#39;m Augustine so please I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.849" end="00:55:16.230" style="s2">just using this as an analogy okay but</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.880" end="00:55:17.820" style="s2">what they did is they laid the fact they</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.230" end="00:55:19.440" style="s2">laid the cultural cognitive grammar for</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.820" end="00:55:22.950" style="s2">an entirely different culture and they</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.440" end="00:55:24.180" style="s2">stole the culture bottom-up from the</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.950" end="00:55:25.859" style="s2">imperial system now it didn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.180" end="00:55:28.680" style="s2">imperial system at some point then</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.859" end="00:55:30.869" style="s2">clamped down again but nevertheless we</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.680" end="00:55:32.849" style="s2">shifted to the middle that we shifted</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.869" end="00:55:38.820" style="s2">out of antiquity we shifted to a</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.849" end="00:55:43.700" style="s2">different world and so I want to try and</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.820" end="00:55:46.650" style="s2">do that I want to try and create the</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.700" end="00:55:48.660" style="s2">systems of meaning the the religion</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.650" end="00:55:53.880" style="s2">that&#39;s not a religion the ecologies of</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.660" end="00:55:55.619" style="s2">practices the communities the networks</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.880" end="00:55:59.880" style="s2">of communities all of this is already</p>

<p begin="00:56:09.020" end="00:56:15.420" style="s2">the people who have been abusing us for</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.230" end="00:56:18.309" style="s2">such a very long time and I usually</p>

<p begin="00:56:18.309" end="00:56:24.400" style="s2">think that political framing is often a</p>

<p begin="00:56:28.299" end="00:56:32.559" style="s2">of been ossified and I think this also I</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.969" end="00:56:34.930" style="s2">think Dan was pointing out that - the</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.559" end="00:56:39.809" style="s2">way it&#39;s been ossified in ways that make</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.930" end="00:56:43.599" style="s2">choice no longer sort of really relevant</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.809" end="00:56:46.449" style="s2">so all right this is my most radical</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.599" end="00:56:48.640" style="s2">thing I guess I&#39;m gonna say I want yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.449" end="00:56:52.119" style="s2">I want to help steal the culture away</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.640" end="00:56:56.289" style="s2">steal it away and do everything I can</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.119" end="00:56:58.749" style="s2">and you know Christianity stoled the</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.289" end="00:57:00.609" style="s2">culture away from the elites it&#39;s time</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.749" end="00:57:03.279" style="s2">now if new elites form they always will</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.609" end="00:57:07.660" style="s2">but the culture changed and it changed</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.279" end="00:57:10.089" style="s2">in an important way and that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.660" end="00:57:11.979" style="s2">trying to do right now and that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.089" end="00:57:17.019" style="s2">what I see myself doing with a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.979" end="00:57:19.359" style="s2">these other people that&#39;s very noble and</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.019" end="00:57:21.969" style="s2">you certainly have a lot of people who</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.359" end="00:57:23.949" style="s2">aren&#39;t in those positions I mean if</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.969" end="00:57:26.019" style="s2">you&#39;re amides you&#39;ve sort of grown up in</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.949" end="00:57:27.339" style="s2">the world sort of looks like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.019" end="00:57:28.630" style="s2">running backwards so it&#39;s hard to even</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.339" end="00:57:32.589" style="s2">imagine that it&#39;s been that way for</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.630" end="00:57:34.150" style="s2">decades prior but this decade certainly</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.589" end="00:57:38.259" style="s2">feels like it&#39;s going there&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.150" end="00:57:41.949" style="s2">be some collision between the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.259" end="00:57:47.769" style="s2">fresh traded emerging game be tights and</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.949" end="00:57:50.049" style="s2">the sort of entrenched game a leaders um</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.769" end="00:57:52.119" style="s2">the whole point about the the whole</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.049" end="00:57:55.029" style="s2">point about the metaphor is we can&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.119" end="00:57:55.390" style="s2">can&#39;t win by playing the game that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.029" end="00:57:57.910" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.390" end="00:58:00.459" style="s2">and so my way of trying to understand</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.910" end="00:58:01.839" style="s2">what it is to not play their game and to</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.459" end="00:58:04.749" style="s2">shift over to in a totally different</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.839" end="00:58:08.170" style="s2">game to shift the culture it&#39;s to steal</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.749" end="00:58:10.269" style="s2">the culture and the way to do that the</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.170" end="00:58:12.130" style="s2">way we&#39;ve right the only thing I can get</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.269" end="00:58:14.259" style="s2">from history that&#39;s been able to do that</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.130" end="00:58:18.910" style="s2">are religion but for reasons that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.259" end="00:58:20.499" style="s2">articulated I don&#39;t want not personally</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.910" end="00:58:22.809" style="s2">I mean in terms of the functionality I</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.499" end="00:58:25.630" style="s2">don&#39;t think the standard model the axial</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.809" end="00:58:26.709" style="s2">age model of religion is going to do</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.630" end="00:58:30.240" style="s2">what we need in order to steal the</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.709" end="00:58:32.890" style="s2">culture as deeply as we need to steal it</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.240" end="00:58:33.450" style="s2">hmm John do you have time for one more</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.890" end="00:58:38.710" style="s2">question</p>

<p begin="00:58:52.210" end="00:58:57.130" style="s2">urgency unless sort of coming into</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.520" end="00:58:59.260" style="s2">contact with our meaning and yep how</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.130" end="00:59:01.210" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen it like growing up and I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:59:09.640" end="00:59:13.480" style="s2">seemed to come up on us obviously lots</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.500" end="00:59:16.120" style="s2">of people were raising the flags but it</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.480" end="00:59:17.920" style="s2">came out as quickly and given your</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.120" end="00:59:19.990" style="s2">having valid suspicions that this is not</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.920" end="00:59:22.210" style="s2">the last time it&#39;s gonna happen I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.990" end="00:59:24.340" style="s2">wondering how are we going to develop or</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.210" end="00:59:27.100" style="s2">grow up even more quickly like it seems</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.340" end="00:59:28.750" style="s2">even more urgent so that we I don&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.100" end="00:59:31.030" style="s2">can mitigate this chance of descending</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.750" end="00:59:35.890" style="s2">into chaos if you know we have a second</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.030" end="00:59:38.260" style="s2">wave of this in a short term we just we</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.890" end="00:59:39.880" style="s2">we need to we need to well sort of it</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.260" end="00:59:42.370" style="s2">deals with the previous question we need</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.880" end="00:59:44.860" style="s2">to accelerate the all the bottom-up and</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.370" end="00:59:48.180" style="s2">top-down ways in which we&#39;re trying to</p>

<p begin="00:59:53.980" end="00:59:58.630" style="s2">attempts to innovate it in ways that you</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.130" end="01:00:00.670" style="s2">know that I&#39;m deeply in concert with</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.630" end="01:00:06.750" style="s2">about trying to bring back something</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.670" end="01:00:09.910" style="s2">like deal dialectic and via logos and</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.750" end="01:00:11.740" style="s2">it&#39;s sorry I don&#39;t want to look like</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.910" end="01:00:13.150" style="s2">some sort of Marxist Leninist poster or</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.740" end="01:00:14.830" style="s2">something but we you just need to do</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.150" end="01:00:16.750" style="s2">more right we didn&#39;t we meet we we just</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.830" end="01:00:18.760" style="s2">we got it we got to do more we got to</p>

<p begin="01:00:18.760" end="01:00:23.020" style="s2">campfire effect and we have what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.830" end="01:00:24.490" style="s2">happening here and we have that many</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.020" end="01:00:27.580" style="s2">more people are willing to call into</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.490" end="01:00:30.640" style="s2">question the previously unquestioned</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.580" end="01:00:32.560" style="s2">authority of common sense and well</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.640" end="01:00:35.290" style="s2">that&#39;s the way we&#39;ve always done it kind</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.560" end="01:00:40.240" style="s2">of thing and so I mean there is a Kairos</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.290" end="01:00:43.119" style="s2">here I like I said I&#39;m not that</p>

<p begin="01:00:49.989" end="01:00:53.979" style="s2">reassembled but they&#39;re going to be a</p>

<p begin="01:00:57.969" end="01:01:03.339" style="s2">more spaces through which we can weave</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.150" end="01:01:06.999" style="s2">this alternative culture that we need to</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.339" end="01:01:09.910" style="s2">do so I I mean I don&#39;t want to sound</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.999" end="01:01:12.460" style="s2">like boxer an animal farm but you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.910" end="01:01:16.269" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense of which we just right</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.460" end="01:01:20.710" style="s2">now we&#39;ve got to do more of what we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:01:47.979" end="01:01:53.640" style="s2">that&#39;s about leaning into the</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.259" end="01:01:56.019" style="s2">acceleration of change and you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.640" end="01:01:57.219" style="s2">surfing the wave of uncertainty to use</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.019" end="01:01:59.109" style="s2">Andy Clark Stern all they used it for</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.219" end="01:02:01.869" style="s2">slightly different purposes right but</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.109" end="01:02:04.690" style="s2">you know I used the example from Conrad</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.869" end="01:02:09.160" style="s2">of the captain Alliston who&#39;s the ship</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.690" end="01:02:11.739" style="s2">is been right the ship has been swamped</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.160" end="01:02:13.180" style="s2">and they&#39;re all those sailors are</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.739" end="01:02:15.489" style="s2">clinging to the side of the ship and</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.180" end="01:02:18.039" style="s2">Alliston stands and he watches any</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.489" end="01:02:21.309" style="s2">weights and he&#39;s he&#39;s watching and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.039" end="01:02:23.619" style="s2">sensing the unfolding of the wind and</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.309" end="01:02:25.239" style="s2">the wave and then he goes now and he</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.619" end="01:02:28.809" style="s2">gives three orders and they do this</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.239" end="01:02:30.219" style="s2">stuff and they write the ship that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.809" end="01:02:33.579" style="s2">kind of faith I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.219" end="01:02:36.819" style="s2">I feel touched hearing that thanks John</p>

<p begin="01:02:48.130" end="01:02:51.779" style="s2">campfire that we are in right now</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.120" end="01:03:02.320" style="s2">I hope that my pessimism is only will</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.020" end="01:03:05.590" style="s2">only conduce realism and not any kind of</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.320" end="01:03:12.550" style="s2">defeatism in people I hope that&#39;s clear</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.590" end="01:03:17.590" style="s2">because that was my intent and I I I do</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.550" end="01:03:23.170" style="s2">think that it&#39;s important that we try as</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.590" end="01:03:28.000" style="s2">much as possible to not just talk about</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.170" end="01:03:32.020" style="s2">this but exemplify a new way of being to</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.000" end="01:03:33.580" style="s2">people that these are the function of</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.020" end="01:03:35.800" style="s2">these especially because of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.580" end="01:03:40.000" style="s2">virtuality of it is not just what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.800" end="01:03:42.760" style="s2">happening here now but we right and we</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.000" end="01:03:46.330" style="s2">are also exemplifying a new way of being</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.760" end="01:03:49.180" style="s2">a new kind of as I said culture a</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.330" end="01:03:51.700" style="s2">culture of Awakening and we have to pay</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.180" end="01:03:55.710" style="s2">attention to and take seriously that</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.700" end="01:03:59.020" style="s2">responsibility and rule our manner of</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.710" end="01:04:00.970" style="s2">discourse is just as important as the</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.020" end="01:04:02.830" style="s2">matter of our discourse that&#39;s the final</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.970" end="01:04:06.220" style="s2">thing I would want to say about them mmm</p>
