<p begin="00:03:12.319" end="00:03:16.069" style="s2">majority of my early writings on my blog</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.299" end="00:03:17.900" style="s2">and on Twitter were we&#39;re all about</p>

<p begin="00:03:23.090" end="00:03:28.040" style="s2">did you figure out that you wanted to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.739" end="00:03:30.169" style="s2">come an expert on the science of human</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.040" end="00:03:31.880" style="s2">sexuality and was there like a moment</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.169" end="00:03:34.010" style="s2">was there an event it&#39;s something happen</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.880" end="00:03:37.160" style="s2">or was something that you grew up with</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.010" end="00:03:38.989" style="s2">or telling me about that yeah the job I</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.160" end="00:03:41.389" style="s2">have is not the kind of thing where when</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.989" end="00:03:42.470" style="s2">you&#39;re you know ten years old and people</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.389" end="00:03:43.700" style="s2">ask you what you want to do when you</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.470" end="00:03:45.349" style="s2">grow up you say I want to be a sex</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.700" end="00:03:47.720" style="s2">researcher you know it doesn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.349" end="00:03:50.060" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really work like that so for me</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.720" end="00:03:51.560" style="s2">I went to get my PhD in social</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.060" end="00:03:54.290" style="s2">psychology I was studying the psychology</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.560" end="00:03:56.810" style="s2">of romantic relationships and what makes</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.290" end="00:03:59.269" style="s2">for a good healthy long lasting</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.810" end="00:04:00.980" style="s2">relationship and along the way I was</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.269" end="00:04:03.709" style="s2">assigned to be a teaching assistant for</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.980" end="00:04:05.930" style="s2">a human sexuality course and as part of</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.709" end="00:04:09.889" style="s2">that course you know that was sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.930" end="00:04:11.599" style="s2">when I realized that that studying sex</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.889" end="00:04:12.980" style="s2">was even an option you know I was</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.599" end="00:04:14.359" style="s2">training to become a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.980" end="00:04:16.669" style="s2">researcher and I wasn&#39;t being trained</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.359" end="00:04:17.959" style="s2">and sexuality at all and relationship</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.669" end="00:04:20.299" style="s2">researchers weren&#39;t even talking about</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.959" end="00:04:21.650" style="s2">sex which was kind of weird well right</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.299" end="00:04:23.720" style="s2">so what do you what do you attribute</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.650" end="00:04:26.090" style="s2">that to because you know I think we see</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.720" end="00:04:27.830" style="s2">right now there&#39;s so the first thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.090" end="00:04:30.710" style="s2">comes to mind is like the recent APA</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.830" end="00:04:32.469" style="s2">guidelines on toxic masculinity and and</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.710" end="00:04:34.669" style="s2">whatnot and the pathology you know the</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.469" end="00:04:37.039" style="s2">pathologize a shin if that&#39;s even a word</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.669" end="00:04:39.240" style="s2">of what some people might consider to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.039" end="00:04:41.490" style="s2">traditional male</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.240" end="00:04:44.129" style="s2">behaviors but but more importantly it</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.490" end="00:04:46.110" style="s2">sort of leaves out like or introduces</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.129" end="00:04:49.949" style="s2">this idea that psychiatrists at colleges</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.110" end="00:04:52.139" style="s2">aren&#39;t being trained in in studying some</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.949" end="00:04:53.729" style="s2">of the key elements that make up healthy</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.139" end="00:04:56.309" style="s2">relationships and healthy behaviors and</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.729" end="00:04:58.379" style="s2">so what what what do you make of that</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.309" end="00:05:00.389" style="s2">sort of absence that you discovered and</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.379" end="00:05:02.939" style="s2">your training to become a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.389" end="00:05:05.400" style="s2">expert but you&#39;re not learning about</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.939" end="00:05:09.360" style="s2">sexuality itself where does that blind</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.400" end="00:05:12.210" style="s2">spot come from I mean I think a big part</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.360" end="00:05:14.490" style="s2">of it is just that sex remains a</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.210" end="00:05:16.770" style="s2">controversial subject even within the</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.490" end="00:05:18.779" style="s2">field of psychology for the last</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.770" end="00:05:20.339" style="s2">three-and-a-half years I was working in</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.779" end="00:05:22.439" style="s2">a department of counseling psychology</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.339" end="00:05:24.089" style="s2">where I was training future PhD</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.439" end="00:05:25.879" style="s2">counseling psychologists and there was</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.089" end="00:05:28.379" style="s2">one class and their entire curriculum</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.879" end="00:05:30.180" style="s2">devoted to sex therapy and it was also</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.379" end="00:05:31.710" style="s2">like a sexy in marriage and</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.180" end="00:05:34.139" style="s2">relationships course it was everything</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.710" end="00:05:36.899" style="s2">all in one and this idea that you can</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.139" end="00:05:38.039" style="s2">teach these counselors like everything</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.899" end="00:05:40.169" style="s2">they need to know about sex in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.039" end="00:05:43.830" style="s2">context of one semester in one class is</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.169" end="00:05:45.659" style="s2">just kind of absurd I think also there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.830" end="00:05:47.249" style="s2">part of it that you know why we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.659" end="00:05:48.899" style="s2">have as much research in this topic is</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.249" end="00:05:50.339" style="s2">that it&#39;s hard to get grant funding if</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.899" end="00:05:50.729" style="s2">you want to study anything related to</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.339" end="00:05:52.800" style="s2">sex</p>

<p begin="00:05:52.800" end="00:05:56.430" style="s2">aren&#39;t many funding mechanisms for it so</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.810" end="00:05:58.139" style="s2">people tend not to study it because</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.430" end="00:05:59.759" style="s2">these days you kind of have to go where</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.139" end="00:06:02.669" style="s2">the money is if you&#39;re an array emic</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.759" end="00:06:05.999" style="s2">right so what what do you attribute that</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.669" end="00:06:08.309" style="s2">sort of backing way way up to the most</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.999" end="00:06:10.800" style="s2">macro level and I can I can imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.309" end="00:06:13.740" style="s2">the same forces that are guiding the</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.800" end="00:06:16.020" style="s2">amount of funding available for research</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.740" end="00:06:18.930" style="s2">and the time spent you know learning</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.020" end="00:06:21.169" style="s2">about it you know you can tie all that</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.930" end="00:06:24.419" style="s2">together like what what do you make of</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.169" end="00:06:26.639" style="s2">humans who engage in sexual activities</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.419" end="00:06:28.849" style="s2">and sexual thinking on a near-daily and</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.639" end="00:06:32.459" style="s2">virtually constant basis for many of us</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.849" end="00:06:34.259" style="s2">what do you attribute this sort of I</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.459" end="00:06:37.680" style="s2">don&#39;t know what you call it is it an</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.259" end="00:06:40.979" style="s2">aversion is it a willing ignorance like</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.680" end="00:06:43.620" style="s2">why why are people not as interested in</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.979" end="00:06:47.610" style="s2">this element of our existence which is</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.620" end="00:06:49.560" style="s2">you know crucial 100 percent of who we</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.610" end="00:06:51.990" style="s2">are and our perpetuation of the species</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.560" end="00:06:52.289" style="s2">like why don&#39;t why don&#39;t people want to</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.990" end="00:06:54.539" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.289" end="00:06:56.369" style="s2">more about this yeah this is one of</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.539" end="00:06:57.629" style="s2">these things where I often like to say</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.369" end="00:06:59.789" style="s2">when it comes to sex we have a much</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.629" end="00:07:01.889" style="s2">easier time doing it than we do talking</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.789" end="00:07:03.839" style="s2">about it and it&#39;s because we have so</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.889" end="00:07:06.659" style="s2">much shame and guilt and embarrassment</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.839" end="00:07:09.119" style="s2">and anxiety that&#39;s that&#39;s tied up in it</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.659" end="00:07:11.520" style="s2">and this goes back centuries you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.119" end="00:07:13.080" style="s2">this is not a new thing it&#39;s you can</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.520" end="00:07:15.449" style="s2">talk about the role of religion the role</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.080" end="00:07:18.779" style="s2">of politics all of these things go in</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.449" end="00:07:20.460" style="s2">and have made sex this taboo topic in in</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.779" end="00:07:23.639" style="s2">something that we just feel so much</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.460" end="00:07:25.110" style="s2">apprehension studying or talking about</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.639" end="00:07:27.149" style="s2">and it wasn&#39;t even until very recently</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.110" end="00:07:28.709" style="s2">the last half century or so that people</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.149" end="00:07:31.289" style="s2">have even thought that sex was something</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.709" end="00:07:33.869" style="s2">you could study scientifically so the</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.289" end="00:07:35.669" style="s2">idea of sex is the science is also a new</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.869" end="00:07:38.490" style="s2">concept and it&#39;s taking a long time for</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.669" end="00:07:40.589" style="s2">it to find its footing in society that</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.490" end="00:07:42.330" style="s2">that just blows my mind I mean this is</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.589" end="00:07:44.759" style="s2">like one of the most basic human</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.330" end="00:07:46.649" style="s2">activities you know that we engage in</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.759" end="00:07:48.449" style="s2">and the fact that there&#39;s a blind spot</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.649" end="00:07:49.499" style="s2">to it an aversion to it and as we were</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.449" end="00:07:51.959" style="s2">talking about before we started</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.499" end="00:07:53.189" style="s2">recording you know I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.959" end="00:07:55.740" style="s2">you&#39;ve experienced this personally but</p>

<p begin="00:08:02.189" end="00:08:07.889" style="s2">like a stigma even attached to the idea</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.209" end="00:08:09.149" style="s2">of thinking about it talking about it</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.889" end="00:08:11.430" style="s2">writing about it I mean have you</p>

<p begin="00:08:30.479" end="00:08:35.250" style="s2">sure there are people who don&#39;t take it</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.430" end="00:08:40.250" style="s2">seriously I can tell you even some of my</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.250" end="00:08:42.539" style="s2">my fellow colleagues a lot of them have</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.250" end="00:08:43.860" style="s2">dismissed the fact that I teach a human</p>

<p begin="00:08:43.860" end="00:08:47.010" style="s2">and they say oh well that&#39;s easy</p>

<p begin="00:08:47.010" end="00:08:49.500" style="s2">be the you know like the easiest course</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.209" end="00:08:50.790" style="s2">to teach because who wouldn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.500" end="00:08:52.470" style="s2">learn about it but it&#39;s actually one of</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.790" end="00:08:54.449" style="s2">the hardest courses you can possibly</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.470" end="00:08:56.790" style="s2">teach because everything you say is a</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.449" end="00:09:01.470" style="s2">potential minefield you know for a fend</p>

<p begin="00:09:09.860" end="00:09:14.300" style="s2">and they&#39;re they&#39;re asking the most</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.590" end="00:09:17.750" style="s2">basic questions and so you have to</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.300" end="00:09:19.310" style="s2">assume nothing so it&#39;s actually an</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.750" end="00:09:20.930" style="s2">incredibly challenging course to teach</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.310" end="00:09:23.330" style="s2">but people dismiss it because they think</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.930" end="00:09:24.230" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s frivolous it&#39;s sex they don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:10:03.620" end="00:10:08.270" style="s2">something he&#39;s like that we call that</p>

<p begin="00:10:12.080" end="00:10:16.300" style="s2">experience like I like I said I wrote a</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.120" end="00:10:18.950" style="s2">lot about sex and then I sort of learned</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.300" end="00:10:20.570" style="s2">personally that the things that I found</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.950" end="00:10:22.370" style="s2">were disrupting male-female</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.570" end="00:10:25.550" style="s2">relationships and disrupting the bedroom</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.370" end="00:10:27.560" style="s2">were also tied to other things that were</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.550" end="00:10:29.960" style="s2">disrupting the nation politically and</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.560" end="00:10:31.610" style="s2">like creating a lot of divides and and</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.960" end="00:10:33.830" style="s2">and disrupting our dating and mating</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.610" end="00:10:35.150" style="s2">markets we&#39;re all tied together with the</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.830" end="00:10:37.970" style="s2">political scene and so I started writing</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.150" end="00:10:39.290" style="s2">about politics and then every time I you</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.970" end="00:10:40.280" style="s2">know in the beginning certainly as I</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.290" end="00:10:41.630" style="s2">started writing more about politics</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.280" end="00:10:42.860" style="s2">people like oh you&#39;re just a guy they</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.630" end="00:10:44.960" style="s2">wrote about sex and here&#39;s the guy that</p>

<p begin="00:12:10.690" end="00:12:15.340" style="s2">history and maybe some of the things</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.190" end="00:12:18.220" style="s2">that we may recognize as a product of</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.340" end="00:12:20.950" style="s2">that work so the Kinsey Institute is an</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.220" end="00:12:22.840" style="s2">Indiana University and it traces its</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.950" end="00:12:25.060" style="s2">roots back to Alfred Kinsey who</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.840" end="00:12:27.250" style="s2">conducted these landmark studies of</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.060" end="00:12:30.060" style="s2">human sexuality back in the 1940s and</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.250" end="00:12:32.050" style="s2">50s and he wrote two books that were</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.060" end="00:12:34.510" style="s2">groundbreaking at the time because they</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.050" end="00:12:37.480" style="s2">were the first real attempts to study</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.510" end="00:12:39.130" style="s2">sex scientifically and he surveyed or</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.480" end="00:12:41.020" style="s2">interviewed thousands of Americans</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.130" end="00:12:43.030" style="s2">around the u.s. about what they were</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.020" end="00:12:45.190" style="s2">doing sexually and he published it in</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.030" end="00:12:46.570" style="s2">the form of two books the first was a</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.190" end="00:12:49.570" style="s2">mail volume the second was a female</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.570" end="00:12:51.580" style="s2">volume and these were just a bombshell</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.570" end="00:12:53.800" style="s2">of the American public in terms of what</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.580" end="00:12:57.610" style="s2">they revealed about what people were</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.800" end="00:12:59.350" style="s2">doing sexually you know for example the</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.610" end="00:13:00.970" style="s2">the women&#39;s volume in particular was</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.350" end="00:13:03.160" style="s2">incredibly controversial for showing</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.970" end="00:13:04.810" style="s2">that hey women actually like sex - and</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.160" end="00:13:07.720" style="s2">women are masturbating women engage in</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.810" end="00:13:10.600" style="s2">same-sex behavior so you know the these</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.720" end="00:13:12.640" style="s2">these were revolutionary books for the</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.600" end="00:13:14.950" style="s2">time that they were published and so the</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.640" end="00:13:17.800" style="s2">kids Institute&#39;s legacy really really</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.950" end="00:13:20.290" style="s2">starts there and and the Institute it</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.800" end="00:13:22.090" style="s2">continues in Kinzie&#39;s name to this day</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.290" end="00:13:24.070" style="s2">and they have some of the best sex</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.090" end="00:13:26.440" style="s2">scientists in the world who are doing</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.070" end="00:13:28.720" style="s2">research in a lot of different areas but</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.440" end="00:13:30.730" style="s2">it&#39;s all aimed at furthering the the</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.720" end="00:13:32.000" style="s2">science of sex and we do some graduate</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.730" end="00:13:33.980" style="s2">training there</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.000" end="00:13:35.630" style="s2">where you know we&#39;re helping to train</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.980" end="00:13:37.430" style="s2">the next generation of sex researchers</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.630" end="00:13:38.990" style="s2">so there are postdocs were there were</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.430" end="00:13:40.940" style="s2">actively involved in research as well</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.990" end="00:13:42.650" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.940" end="00:13:44.990" style="s2">intellectually stimulating place to be I</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.650" end="00:13:49.190" style="s2">guess to be landing in all kinds of ways</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.990" end="00:13:51.590" style="s2">I think I feel like I saw it was like on</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.190" end="00:13:53.800" style="s2">Showtime or HBO or something I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.590" end="00:13:56.600" style="s2">there was like a series done about</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.800" end="00:13:58.520" style="s2">Kinsey and maybe the studies and I see I</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.600" end="00:14:00.950" style="s2">seem to remember them like actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.520" end="00:14:02.720" style="s2">observing live subjects is that is that</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.950" end="00:14:03.860" style="s2">right so I think you might be referring</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.720" end="00:14:06.050" style="s2">to masters of sex</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.860" end="00:14:08.090" style="s2">yes that&#39;s it yeah so that was the</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.050" end="00:14:11.030" style="s2">Showtime series about William masters in</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.090" end="00:14:13.150" style="s2">Virginia Johnson and they came just a</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.030" end="00:14:17.900" style="s2">little bit after Kinsey and they did the</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.150" end="00:14:19.550" style="s2">you know sort of live sex studies where</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.900" end="00:14:21.350" style="s2">were they were developing technologies</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.550" end="00:14:23.690" style="s2">to study what was happening inside the</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.350" end="00:14:27.710" style="s2">body when people were becoming aroused</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.690" end="00:14:29.240" style="s2">and having orgasms and their work</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.710" end="00:14:31.070" style="s2">actually took place in st. Louis</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.240" end="00:14:33.350" style="s2">Missouri it&#39;s funny when you look back</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.070" end="00:14:35.660" style="s2">and you look at Indiana and Missouri</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.350" end="00:14:39.110" style="s2">would like the hot beds for sex research</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.660" end="00:14:41.300" style="s2">and not San Francisco no and it&#39;s funny</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.110" end="00:14:44.120" style="s2">you know even today like Indiana is home</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.300" end="00:14:45.440" style="s2">to so many sex researchers but you just</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.120" end="00:14:47.060" style="s2">you wouldn&#39;t know it because it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.440" end="00:14:48.500" style="s2">you know politically conservative state</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.060" end="00:14:49.310" style="s2">and people don&#39;t tend to associate sex</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.500" end="00:14:52.130" style="s2">research with us</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.310" end="00:14:53.510" style="s2">right and is it safe to say that the</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.130" end="00:14:55.610" style="s2">Kinsey Institute is one of the world</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.510" end="00:14:57.920" style="s2">leading institutes for the research and</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.610" end="00:14:59.600" style="s2">human sexuality I think it&#39;s fair to say</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.920" end="00:15:02.930" style="s2">then there there are very few</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.600" end="00:15:05.900" style="s2">Institute&#39;s than sex research so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.930" end="00:15:08.480" style="s2">again I&#39;m just astonished at that fact</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.900" end="00:15:13.190" style="s2">really and so it&#39;s part of my mission</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.480" end="00:15:15.950" style="s2">really to to keep talking about sex</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.190" end="00:15:17.900" style="s2">frankly like I think I&#39;ve found in my</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.950" end="00:15:20.210" style="s2">experience like I work with guys one on</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.900" end="00:15:22.700" style="s2">one and and I just get my get millions</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.210" end="00:15:24.550" style="s2">of emails and tweets and and I meet guys</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.700" end="00:15:27.680" style="s2">all the time all across the country who</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.550" end="00:15:29.690" style="s2">expressed to me that they are confused</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.680" end="00:15:33.140" style="s2">about sexuality and relationships in</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.690" end="00:15:35.000" style="s2">particular they find themselves having</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.140" end="00:15:36.680" style="s2">fantasies or desires that don&#39;t line up</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.000" end="00:15:38.810" style="s2">with what people are telling them is</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.680" end="00:15:40.610" style="s2">okay because in fact actually people are</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.810" end="00:15:41.810" style="s2">even telling them what is okay and what</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.610" end="00:15:43.200" style="s2">is and they&#39;re just saying kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.810" end="00:15:44.460" style="s2">don&#39;t talk about I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.200" end="00:15:46.740" style="s2">just kind of do it and everything will</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.460" end="00:15:47.880" style="s2">be just fine just be yourself and so</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.740" end="00:15:49.620" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of uncertainty out there</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.880" end="00:15:52.940" style="s2">and there&#39;s a lot of stigma and taboo</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.620" end="00:15:56.760" style="s2">and it&#39;s might be fighting an uphill but</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.940" end="00:15:58.500" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to diminish some of the taboo</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.760" end="00:16:00.870" style="s2">around talking about sex and sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.500" end="00:16:02.970" style="s2">because really what I one of my main</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.870" end="00:16:04.710" style="s2">missions is to help alleviate shame</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.970" end="00:16:07.080" style="s2">right like I just don&#39;t want people</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.710" end="00:16:09.180" style="s2">feeling bad for things that are</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.080" end="00:16:12.870" style="s2">perfectly normal and when you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.180" end="00:16:14.880" style="s2">what normal is it&#39;s easy to fall into</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.870" end="00:16:17.190" style="s2">like a shame spiral and think that</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.880" end="00:16:18.600" style="s2">you&#39;re bad or nasty or whatever the case</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.190" end="00:16:21.240" style="s2">may be and then you might live a life of</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.600" end="00:16:23.250" style="s2">fear being unwilling to express your</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.240" end="00:16:25.320" style="s2">your thoughts and your desires and and</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.250" end="00:16:26.790" style="s2">and be unable to communicate them to</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.320" end="00:16:29.130" style="s2">your partners and then I see this</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.790" end="00:16:30.720" style="s2">long-term sort of relationship distress</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.130" end="00:16:32.430" style="s2">that we&#39;re having a lot of it can be</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.720" end="00:16:35.520" style="s2">centered around lack of communication</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.430" end="00:16:37.020" style="s2">and you know I and so to me this is part</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.520" end="00:16:38.310" style="s2">of my mission is to is to help bring</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.020" end="00:16:41.190" style="s2">these conversations to people that might</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.310" end="00:16:42.750" style="s2">not ordinarily hear them and so for that</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.190" end="00:16:46.170" style="s2">I&#39;m really thankful that you&#39;ve taken</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.750" end="00:16:48.540" style="s2">this time to talk to me you&#39;ve written a</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.170" end="00:16:51.870" style="s2">book and the book is called tell me what</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.540" end="00:16:53.970" style="s2">you want and it is from what I</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.870" end="00:16:55.830" style="s2">understand like one of the few if only</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.970" end="00:16:57.570" style="s2">books I have have this amount of</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.830" end="00:16:59.610" style="s2">original research in it that you have</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.570" end="00:17:01.920" style="s2">conducted and so could you just like</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.610" end="00:17:04.410" style="s2">kick off the the general concept of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.920" end="00:17:06.750" style="s2">book and talk about the the study that</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.410" end="00:17:08.520" style="s2">you did and then we&#39;ll sort of work our</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.750" end="00:17:11.540" style="s2">way through all the details and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.520" end="00:17:15.030" style="s2">findings the basis for this book is a</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.540" end="00:17:18.060" style="s2">survey I did of almost 4,200 Americans</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.030" end="00:17:19.980" style="s2">from all 50 states who are very</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.060" end="00:17:22.829" style="s2">demographically diverse participants</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.980" end="00:17:25.589" style="s2">ranging in age from 18 to 87 covering</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.829" end="00:17:28.440" style="s2">the entire political spectrum all gender</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.589" end="00:17:30.000" style="s2">and sexual identities the goal was to</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.440" end="00:17:31.830" style="s2">get as large and diverse a sample as</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.000" end="00:17:35.310" style="s2">possible and I asked these people to</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.830" end="00:17:37.590" style="s2">complete a survey that consisted of 369</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.310" end="00:17:39.570" style="s2">questions that looked at their biggest</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.590" end="00:17:41.040" style="s2">sexual fantasy of all time hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.570" end="00:17:43.080" style="s2">people places things they might have</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.040" end="00:17:44.790" style="s2">ever fantasized about as well as their</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.080" end="00:17:47.070" style="s2">personalities sexual histories</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.790" end="00:17:49.410" style="s2">demographics so that I could really look</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.070" end="00:17:51.180" style="s2">in this comprehensive way at what our</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.410" end="00:17:53.250" style="s2">sexual fantasies are and and what they</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.180" end="00:17:55.440" style="s2">say about us and so I wrote a whole book</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.250" end="00:17:56.400" style="s2">based around the survey that the dives</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.440" end="00:17:58.860" style="s2">into some of the major</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.400" end="00:18:00.930" style="s2">findings it also brings in relevant</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.860" end="00:18:02.520" style="s2">research from from different areas talks</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.930" end="00:18:05.400" style="s2">about for example how it&#39;s tied to</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.520" end="00:18:07.680" style="s2">evolutionary biology how it&#39;s tied to</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.400" end="00:18:09.510" style="s2">neuroscience and then toward the end of</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.680" end="00:18:11.430" style="s2">the book there&#39;s a self-help component</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.510" end="00:18:13.080" style="s2">where I talk about what you can do with</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.430" end="00:18:15.750" style="s2">this information in terms of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.080" end="00:18:18.270" style="s2">improve your own sex life and this study</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.750" end="00:18:19.680" style="s2">how is it conducted because I did a</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.270" end="00:18:21.930" style="s2">study from my book Democrats a</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.680" end="00:18:25.820" style="s2">deplorable where I got about 1,500</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.930" end="00:18:28.290" style="s2">responses to a 67 in question</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.820" end="00:18:30.570" style="s2">sixty-seven questions survey and of</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.290" end="00:18:33.450" style="s2">those questions 15 of them were short</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.570" end="00:18:35.370" style="s2">answer and so basically I have like I</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.450" end="00:18:38.340" style="s2">had like 15,000 like</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.370" end="00:18:39.870" style="s2">essay essays to read and I read them all</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.340" end="00:18:41.850" style="s2">I mean that&#39;s where that&#39;s where so much</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.870" end="00:18:43.410" style="s2">great of the anecdotes and little</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.850" end="00:18:44.820" style="s2">nuggets right there but like I did in</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.410" end="00:18:47.370" style="s2">mind with like a Survey Monkey</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.820" end="00:18:50.310" style="s2">you know app and like I distributed it</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.370" end="00:18:51.660" style="s2">over social media and Internet and how</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.310" end="00:18:53.460" style="s2">did you go about collecting this</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.660" end="00:18:55.140" style="s2">information you pay people to do it you</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.460" end="00:18:57.270" style="s2">hand it to them at person was it done</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.140" end="00:18:58.350" style="s2">over the phone like how did that work so</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.270" end="00:19:00.630" style="s2">as I mentioned a little bit earlier</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.350" end="00:19:02.490" style="s2">there&#39;s I think I meant to this there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.630" end="00:19:04.530" style="s2">not much in the way of grant funding for</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.490" end="00:19:06.990" style="s2">for sex research so I was not paying</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.530" end="00:19:09.750" style="s2">people to do this I was relying on</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.990" end="00:19:11.310" style="s2">volunteers and as a result it took a</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.750" end="00:19:13.370" style="s2">long time I spent almost two years</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.310" end="00:19:15.660" style="s2">gathering all the data to try and get</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.370" end="00:19:16.980" style="s2">the sample that was as large and diverse</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.660" end="00:19:19.230" style="s2">as I could and I wanted to make sure</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.980" end="00:19:21.930" style="s2">that every state was included in there</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.230" end="00:19:23.250" style="s2">and and and so forth most of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.930" end="00:19:25.740" style="s2">participants came through social media</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.250" end="00:19:29.010" style="s2">it was advertised over Facebook Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.740" end="00:19:30.420" style="s2">reddit places like that so so the</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.010" end="00:19:32.070" style="s2">demographic skew a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.420" end="00:19:33.690" style="s2">toward the average social media user</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.070" end="00:19:36.750" style="s2">then toward the average American but</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.690" end="00:19:38.130" style="s2">it&#39;s still a very diverse sample right</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.750" end="00:19:40.200" style="s2">yeah and that was one of the main</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.130" end="00:19:41.820" style="s2">criticisms that I got of my survey which</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.200" end="00:19:43.350" style="s2">was you know did you go around door to</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.820" end="00:19:46.440" style="s2">door talking to people that didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.350" end="00:19:48.480" style="s2">internet and used social media and so I</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.440" end="00:19:50.700" style="s2">found that my results may have skewed a</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.480" end="00:19:52.650" style="s2">little bit educated and affluent</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.700" end="00:19:54.300" style="s2">relative to sort of the national</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.650" end="00:19:56.910" style="s2">averages did you did you see something</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.300" end="00:19:58.350" style="s2">similar or what were the diff what what</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.910" end="00:19:59.880" style="s2">would you say the mean if any</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.350" end="00:20:01.500" style="s2">discrepancies that were between your</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.880" end="00:20:04.020" style="s2">sample size and like a nationally</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.500" end="00:20:05.670" style="s2">representative sample so what is that</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.020" end="00:20:07.890" style="s2">it&#39;s a little bit younger so the average</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.670" end="00:20:09.389" style="s2">age of my participants is between 32 and</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.890" end="00:20:13.049" style="s2">33 the average American</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.389" end="00:20:15.209" style="s2">if you look at census data 36 to 37 so</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.049" end="00:20:19.679" style="s2">it&#39;s a little bit younger it&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.209" end="00:20:22.440" style="s2">more educated and you know in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.679" end="00:20:26.279" style="s2">like political and religious background</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.440" end="00:20:28.289" style="s2">you see that you know Republicans are a</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.279" end="00:20:29.609" style="s2">little underrepresented and people with</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.289" end="00:20:31.349" style="s2">religious affiliations are a little</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.609" end="00:20:33.029" style="s2">underrepresented but that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.349" end="00:20:35.309" style="s2">something unique to my work that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.029" end="00:20:38.369" style="s2">of all sexuality studies where there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.309" end="00:20:39.570" style="s2">selection effect for people who tend to</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.369" end="00:20:41.099" style="s2">be a little bit more comfortable talking</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.570" end="00:20:43.529" style="s2">about their sexual attitudes and</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.099" end="00:20:45.719" style="s2">behaviors so I still had hundreds and</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.529" end="00:20:48.869" style="s2">hundreds of people who were Republican</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.719" end="00:20:51.359" style="s2">identified or had various religious</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.869" end="00:20:53.039" style="s2">identities but you know that&#39;s just an</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.359" end="00:20:55.559" style="s2">issue we face in sex research is that</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.039" end="00:20:56.519" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to get representative samples</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.559" end="00:20:58.320" style="s2">from all groups of the population</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.519" end="00:21:01.019" style="s2">because not everybody wants to take part</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.320" end="00:21:02.549" style="s2">in the sex study right like how long did</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.019" end="00:21:04.889" style="s2">it take to complete the survey on</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.549" end="00:21:06.599" style="s2">average it was somewhere between a half</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.889" end="00:21:08.309" style="s2">hour and an hour depending on how long</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.599" end="00:21:10.229" style="s2">people spent with those open-ended</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.309" end="00:21:12.059" style="s2">responses because I asked people to</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.229" end="00:21:13.499" style="s2">write out their favorite fantasy of all</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.059" end="00:21:16.409" style="s2">time and you know some people wrote</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.499" end="00:21:18.749" style="s2">pages okay but people have very detailed</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.409" end="00:21:19.529" style="s2">fantasy if it turns out yeah and like to</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.749" end="00:21:21.059" style="s2">talk about it</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.529" end="00:21:22.799" style="s2">yeah and like to write about it was I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.059" end="00:21:25.049" style="s2">assuming it was a completely anonymous</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.799" end="00:21:26.729" style="s2">it was completely anonymous and you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.049" end="00:21:29.700" style="s2">something that&#39;s interesting is that in</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.729" end="00:21:32.940" style="s2">most of my sexin relationship studies I</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.700" end="00:21:36.419" style="s2">do men tend to be underrepresented in my</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.940" end="00:21:37.829" style="s2">sexual fantasy research men are you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.419" end="00:21:39.809" style="s2">on par with women or they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.829" end="00:21:41.429" style="s2">over-represented in some cases which I</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.809" end="00:21:42.929" style="s2">think speaks to the fact that you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.429" end="00:21:45.599" style="s2">men really want to talk about their</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.929" end="00:21:47.609" style="s2">fantasies which so so I found that to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.599" end="00:21:49.919" style="s2">interesting and doing this work that is</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.609" end="00:21:51.599" style="s2">interesting what why do you why do you</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.919" end="00:21:54.239" style="s2">think people want to talk about their</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.599" end="00:21:57.779" style="s2">fantasies because almost all of us have</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.239" end="00:22:00.450" style="s2">them and a lot of us just don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.779" end="00:22:02.159" style="s2">they&#39;re normal or not you know we seem</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.450" end="00:22:03.749" style="s2">to be very worried about our fantasies</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.159" end="00:22:05.369" style="s2">and that was one of the things I found</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.749" end="00:22:06.929" style="s2">in this work is that I asked people you</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.369" end="00:22:08.070" style="s2">know what are the kinds of emotions that</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.929" end="00:22:09.809" style="s2">come to mind when you&#39;re thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.070" end="00:22:11.940" style="s2">your favorite fantasy and you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.809" end="00:22:14.129" style="s2">people report a lot of guilt shame and</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.940" end="00:22:15.749" style="s2">anxiety and and I also ask people you</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.129" end="00:22:17.700" style="s2">know how common do you think your your</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.749" end="00:22:19.169" style="s2">fantasy is and people tended to</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.700" end="00:22:20.930" style="s2">underestimate it they thought their</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.169" end="00:22:22.790" style="s2">fantasies were rare</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.930" end="00:22:25.309" style="s2">the rarer people thought their fantasies</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.790" end="00:22:26.870" style="s2">were the more negative emotions they</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.309" end="00:22:28.520" style="s2">felt about it so I think that&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.870" end="00:22:30.080" style="s2">part of what&#39;s going on here is we just</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.520" end="00:22:31.910" style="s2">we think we&#39;re weird because we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.080" end="00:22:34.430" style="s2">have the information and then that leads</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.910" end="00:22:37.880" style="s2">us to hide this and feel more ashamed</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.430" end="00:22:39.170" style="s2">than than we should right right I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.880" end="00:22:41.750" style="s2">jumping ahead here with this question</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.170" end="00:22:45.500" style="s2">but do you think that if we educate</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.750" end="00:22:47.540" style="s2">people on the quote normality of their</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.500" end="00:22:50.780" style="s2">fantasies that that would lead to a</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.540" end="00:22:53.210" style="s2">greater percentage of people sort of</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.780" end="00:22:57.410" style="s2">trying to activate those fantasies and</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.210" end="00:22:59.480" style="s2">live them out I think there is something</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.410" end="00:23:02.210" style="s2">to be said for education about you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.480" end="00:23:06.530" style="s2">what what sexual interests are more or</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.210" end="00:23:08.510" style="s2">less common but I think in doing so we</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.530" end="00:23:10.010" style="s2">need to also educate people about the</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.510" end="00:23:12.350" style="s2">difference between a fantasy and a</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.010" end="00:23:14.750" style="s2">desire and you know it&#39;s okay to have an</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.350" end="00:23:16.460" style="s2">OP that turns you on but the desire to</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.750" end="00:23:19.220" style="s2">actually do it and the actual behavior</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.460" end="00:23:20.870" style="s2">might be something very different so we</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.220" end="00:23:22.790" style="s2">also need to provide a lot of education</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.870" end="00:23:25.190" style="s2">around how do you turn a fantasy into</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.790" end="00:23:26.720" style="s2">reality when should you or shouldn&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.190" end="00:23:28.640" style="s2">think about doing that and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.720" end="00:23:30.620" style="s2">something that I&#39;d try to get into a bit</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.640" end="00:23:32.780" style="s2">in the book but yeah when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.620" end="00:23:34.670" style="s2">the sex education there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.780" end="00:23:36.200" style="s2">that we need to cover there right well I</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.670" end="00:23:38.030" style="s2">just made me think of an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.200" end="00:23:40.910" style="s2">phenomenon where you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.030" end="00:23:42.980" style="s2">greater the awareness it may actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.910" end="00:23:45.740" style="s2">change behavior it&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.980" end="00:23:47.660" style="s2">thing to think about in terms of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.740" end="00:23:49.850" style="s2">like our imitating life imitating art</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.660" end="00:23:51.500" style="s2">like but more you tell people something</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.850" end="00:23:53.720" style="s2">is okay maybe the more they&#39;re gonna do</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.500" end="00:23:55.670" style="s2">it maybe maybe maybe the research ends</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.720" end="00:23:57.290" style="s2">up changing behaviors because people</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.670" end="00:23:59.360" style="s2">feel less shame or they feel empowered</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.290" end="00:24:01.760" style="s2">or they feel like it&#39;s it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.360" end="00:24:03.830" style="s2">normal and so that&#39;s interesting I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.760" end="00:24:06.860" style="s2">unfortunately there&#39;s a long way to go</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.830" end="00:24:08.900" style="s2">before before the results of this type</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.860" end="00:24:11.809" style="s2">of work becomes part of the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.900" end="00:24:14.750" style="s2">common wisdom of our culture so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.809" end="00:24:15.500" style="s2">think we have to not gonna happen</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.750" end="00:24:18.200" style="s2">anytime soon</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.500" end="00:24:19.429" style="s2">I see we brought you brought up</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.200" end="00:24:21.050" style="s2">something that I wanted that was like</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.429" end="00:24:23.210" style="s2">one of my first questions about the</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.050" end="00:24:26.300" style="s2">whole study which is can you define what</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.210" end="00:24:29.810" style="s2">a fantasy is for me and then you you</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.300" end="00:24:31.340" style="s2">couched it also versus desire and so</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.810" end="00:24:32.870" style="s2">because that was something that I kept</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.340" end="00:24:33.770" style="s2">asking myself as I was reading the book</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.870" end="00:24:35.929" style="s2">that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.770" end="00:24:37.940" style="s2">what what is a fantasy what am i</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.929" end="00:24:39.380" style="s2">fantasizing about and then I also</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.940" end="00:24:41.120" style="s2">thought later like well if I stop</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.380" end="00:24:42.530" style="s2">fantasizing about it now does that mean</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.120" end="00:24:44.179" style="s2">that I&#39;m no longer interested in and</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.530" end="00:24:45.559" style="s2">there&#39;s all there&#39;s all all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.179" end="00:24:46.910" style="s2">questions that go along with that so</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.559" end="00:24:50.059" style="s2">let&#39;s just start with that like what</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.910" end="00:24:51.710" style="s2">what is what is a fantasy so a fantasy</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.059" end="00:24:54.320" style="s2">is something that happens while you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.710" end="00:24:55.850" style="s2">awake it&#39;s a conscious thought so this</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.320" end="00:24:57.410" style="s2">is different from a sex dream that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.850" end="00:24:59.450" style="s2">that&#39;s something totally different and</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.410" end="00:25:01.730" style="s2">something I don&#39;t really get into so</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.450" end="00:25:05.290" style="s2">fantasy is a conscious thought that you</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.730" end="00:25:08.480" style="s2">find to be arousing sexually so it is a</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.290" end="00:25:12.050" style="s2">mental thought or image that that turns</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.480" end="00:25:13.460" style="s2">you on and a fantasy may or may not be a</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.050" end="00:25:15.950" style="s2">desire a desire is something you</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.460" end="00:25:17.660" style="s2">actually want to do I find that for most</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.950" end="00:25:20.240" style="s2">people their favorite fantasy of all</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.660" end="00:25:21.920" style="s2">time is a desire about 80% of people say</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.240" end="00:25:23.510" style="s2">it&#39;s something they would like to make</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.920" end="00:25:26.000" style="s2">part of their sex life in the future</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.510" end="00:25:28.250" style="s2">but most people have lots and lots of</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.000" end="00:25:29.720" style="s2">fantasies and most of our fantasies</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.250" end="00:25:31.490" style="s2">aren&#39;t desires you know it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.720" end="00:25:32.960" style="s2">case that every thought we ever have</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.490" end="00:25:35.800" style="s2">that turns us on represents something</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.960" end="00:25:37.940" style="s2">that we true they want to do right and</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.800" end="00:25:39.679" style="s2">you know I&#39;ve talked to a lot of girls</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.940" end="00:25:40.970" style="s2">that have like gangbang fantasies and a</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.679" end="00:25:42.650" style="s2">lot of them will say that they have a</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.970" end="00:25:45.650" style="s2">fantasy about it but quote some things</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.650" end="00:25:47.809" style="s2">are left better as fantasies that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.650" end="00:25:50.000" style="s2">something we talk about later too but um</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.809" end="00:25:53.030" style="s2">is there a difference between like a a</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.000" end="00:25:54.320" style="s2">sexual thought and a fantasy right</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.030" end="00:25:55.760" style="s2">because I can think about all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.320" end="00:25:58.370" style="s2">sexual things I might like to do but it</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.760" end="00:26:00.770" style="s2">may or may not actually stir a physical</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.370" end="00:26:05.390" style="s2">arousal like for your work where you</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.770" end="00:26:08.179" style="s2">focus solely on a thought that actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.390" end="00:26:09.470" style="s2">causes some sort of sexual arousal in</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.179" end="00:26:12.380" style="s2">the body whatever those physiological</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.470" end="00:26:14.270" style="s2">markers may be and could you describe</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.380" end="00:26:15.559" style="s2">what those may be also yeah so in terms</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.270" end="00:26:17.300" style="s2">of the way I defined it for my</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.559" end="00:26:19.760" style="s2">participants I was very clear at the</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.300" end="00:26:21.980" style="s2">beginning of the survey to say this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.760" end="00:26:24.890" style="s2">what a sexual fantasy is it&#39;s a mental</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.980" end="00:26:28.070" style="s2">thought or image that that turns you on</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.890" end="00:26:30.110" style="s2">it creates sexual arousal so yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.070" end="00:26:30.860" style="s2">can think about sex but not have it be a</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.110" end="00:26:32.510" style="s2">turn-on</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.860" end="00:26:35.390" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s not what I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.510" end="00:26:37.220" style="s2">here it&#39;s only cases where it actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.390" end="00:26:39.679" style="s2">creates a state of arousal and that</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.220" end="00:26:42.110" style="s2">could be mentally you feel aroused it</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.679" end="00:26:44.330" style="s2">could be genitally it could be both it</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.110" end="00:26:46.340" style="s2">kind of depends you know sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.330" end="00:26:47.270" style="s2">people will fantasize in a situation</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.340" end="00:26:48.920" style="s2">where they tried</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.270" end="00:26:51.590" style="s2">to inhibit their genital response you</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.920" end="00:26:54.110" style="s2">know I find some people fantasize about</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.590" end="00:26:56.060" style="s2">sex when they&#39;re in church and you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.110" end="00:26:57.890" style="s2">they they might inhibit their their</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.060" end="00:26:59.120" style="s2">genital arousal in that situation but</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.890" end="00:27:01.520" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re still turned on</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.120" end="00:27:03.620" style="s2">subjectively mentally just not</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.520" end="00:27:05.060" style="s2">physically and would you would you say</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.620" end="00:27:07.580" style="s2">that a fantasy is more likely to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.060" end="00:27:09.590" style="s2">spontaneous or something that you are</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.580" end="00:27:10.880" style="s2">proactive like in like because if you</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.590" end="00:27:12.200" style="s2">ask me start thinking about things I can</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.880" end="00:27:14.120" style="s2">start think about a ton of stuff but it</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.200" end="00:27:16.370" style="s2">like is this something is this something</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.120" end="00:27:18.620" style="s2">that you know I mean it doesn&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.370" end="00:27:20.390" style="s2">to me so much anymore honestly but I do</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.620" end="00:27:21.950" style="s2">remember just being like hit with waves</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.390" end="00:27:23.870" style="s2">of like oh yeah I really want to do this</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.950" end="00:27:24.980" style="s2">thing oh my god that sounds amazing you</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.870" end="00:27:27.410" style="s2">know is there a certain level of</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.980" end="00:27:30.730" style="s2">spontaneous thought that involved in it</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.410" end="00:27:34.130" style="s2">being a fantasy and or do you see</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.730" end="00:27:35.870" style="s2">fantasies more common among certain age</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.130" end="00:27:37.550" style="s2">groups like when people get older do</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.870" end="00:27:39.290" style="s2">fantasy start to diminish and you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.550" end="00:27:43.430" style="s2">is there a peak to that or something</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.290" end="00:27:45.260" style="s2">sure so fantasies I think it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.430" end="00:27:47.360" style="s2">to recognize that they serve a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.260" end="00:27:49.460" style="s2">different functions so when I ask people</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.360" end="00:27:50.840" style="s2">why they fantasize they do it for a lot</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.460" end="00:27:52.370" style="s2">of different reasons and when I ask</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.840" end="00:27:54.310" style="s2">people where they fantasize they do it</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.370" end="00:27:56.950" style="s2">in a lot of different situations so</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.310" end="00:27:59.900" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s just this spontaneous</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.950" end="00:28:02.270" style="s2">inexplicable you know thought that pops</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.900" end="00:28:05.090" style="s2">into your head other times however it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.270" end="00:28:07.730" style="s2">very deliberate so for example if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.090" end="00:28:10.520" style="s2">having sex with a partner you might</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.730" end="00:28:13.250" style="s2">intentionally fantasize so as to</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.520" end="00:28:15.230" style="s2">maintain arousal or you might</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.250" end="00:28:17.270" style="s2">intentionally fantasize because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.230" end="00:28:19.820" style="s2">you know in the process of masturbating</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.270" end="00:28:21.440" style="s2">and it&#39;s a way of you know getting there</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.820" end="00:28:22.850" style="s2">so so there are times when we</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.440" end="00:28:24.380" style="s2">deliberately call to mind but there were</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.850" end="00:28:26.660" style="s2">other times where it just it just pops</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.380" end="00:28:29.090" style="s2">into the head right right</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.660" end="00:28:30.500" style="s2">interesting and what about the age is</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.090" end="00:28:32.660" style="s2">there a relationship between like the</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.500" end="00:28:35.390" style="s2">frequency of sexual fantasy and and your</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.660" end="00:28:36.980" style="s2">age yeah I think it&#39;s interesting when</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.390" end="00:28:39.830" style="s2">you talk about age and sexual fantasies</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.980" end="00:28:44.180" style="s2">because you know yes we do tend to</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.830" end="00:28:47.300" style="s2">fantasize a little less often and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.180" end="00:28:48.980" style="s2">that&#39;s tied to you know just general</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.300" end="00:28:51.770" style="s2">changes in libido that happen as we age</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.980" end="00:28:53.450" style="s2">so if sex drive is decreasing you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.770" end="00:28:55.910" style="s2">probably going to be fantasizing about</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.450" end="00:28:58.130" style="s2">sex a little bit less often but you also</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.910" end="00:29:00.120" style="s2">see changes in the nature of people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.130" end="00:29:02.760" style="s2">fantasies as they age too</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.120" end="00:29:04.679" style="s2">something I looked at in the data for</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.760" end="00:29:06.240" style="s2">this book and we haven&#39;t previously had</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.679" end="00:29:07.919" style="s2">any research on that because almost all</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.240" end="00:29:10.409" style="s2">the fantasy research has been on college</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.919" end="00:29:11.850" style="s2">students and it turns out that college</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.409" end="00:29:13.620" style="s2">students if you want to study sexual</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.850" end="00:29:15.570" style="s2">fantasies are the least interesting</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.620" end="00:29:18.360" style="s2">group you could possibly study because</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.570" end="00:29:19.830" style="s2">they have the most narrow fantasy</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.360" end="00:29:22.110" style="s2">repertoire you know they don&#39;t have as</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.830" end="00:29:24.570" style="s2">much diversity and variability so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.110" end="00:29:27.120" style="s2">actually older adults who have more</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.570" end="00:29:29.400" style="s2">variable fantasy content and there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.120" end="00:29:32.549" style="s2">much more interesting to study yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.400" end="00:29:35.309" style="s2">mean I can tell you that as a teen as a</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.549" end="00:29:36.690" style="s2">youth my fantasies if he close what if</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.309" end="00:29:39.500" style="s2">he cliff you can see inside my clothes</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.690" end="00:29:43.049" style="s2">mine it was just like two giant breasts</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.500" end="00:29:45.090" style="s2">right or just like just I&#39;m trusting</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.049" end="00:29:46.620" style="s2">inside of a woman like that was that was</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.090" end="00:29:49.559" style="s2">enough of a fantasy and I&#39;m telling my</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.620" end="00:29:52.200" style="s2">fantasies now involve like complex</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.559" end="00:29:54.750" style="s2">situations props into like multiple</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.200" end="00:29:56.760" style="s2">people their own individual motivations</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.750" end="00:29:58.320" style="s2">the feelings that they&#39;re having you</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.760" end="00:30:00.539" style="s2">know like what I&#39;m wearing where we are</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.320" end="00:30:03.299" style="s2">like they get they get so much more</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.539" end="00:30:05.909" style="s2">complex and that brings up a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.299" end="00:30:08.700" style="s2">other issues too which is one like do</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.909" end="00:30:11.370" style="s2">you see a relationship between people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.700" end="00:30:13.049" style="s2">the number of sex partners they&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.370" end="00:30:14.669" style="s2">well which is not necessarily the same</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.049" end="00:30:18.990" style="s2">as like the amount of sex that they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.669" end="00:30:21.210" style="s2">had and their fantasies also what is the</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.990" end="00:30:22.679" style="s2">impact I&#39;m like I don&#39;t want to call it</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.210" end="00:30:24.870" style="s2">sexual maturity that&#39;s not right but</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.679" end="00:30:26.429" style="s2">like you know being very being</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.870" end="00:30:27.960" style="s2">experience with sex like what is the</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.429" end="00:30:31.260" style="s2">impact on your sexual fantasies there</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.960" end="00:30:33.450" style="s2">too so I don&#39;t recall if I looked at how</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.260" end="00:30:35.580" style="s2">a number of partners was linked to</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.450" end="00:30:38.039" style="s2">people&#39;s sexual fantasies but I did look</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.580" end="00:30:41.070" style="s2">at how sex drive was correlated with it</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.039" end="00:30:43.980" style="s2">and what he&#39;s so Yee is there for people</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.070" end="00:30:46.440" style="s2">who have a higher sex drive they tend to</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.980" end="00:30:49.169" style="s2">have a lot more frequent fantasies and</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.440" end="00:30:50.820" style="s2">more variable fantasy content the same</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.169" end="00:30:52.950" style="s2">goes for people who are what we call</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.820" end="00:30:55.140" style="s2">sensation seekers where they just have</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.950" end="00:30:57.330" style="s2">this heightened need for thrilling and</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.140" end="00:30:59.399" style="s2">risky encounters to try and get them</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.330" end="00:31:00.809" style="s2">there also for people who are high in</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.399" end="00:31:03.899" style="s2">the personality trait of something</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.809" end="00:31:06.360" style="s2">called openness to experience people who</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.899" end="00:31:08.159" style="s2">have overactive imaginations right we</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.360" end="00:31:11.039" style="s2">see certain groups of people who just</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.159" end="00:31:13.920" style="s2">tend to have a lot of diversity in their</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.039" end="00:31:16.830" style="s2">fantasy content so so the</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.920" end="00:31:19.920" style="s2">it would be incorrect to say that like a</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.830" end="00:31:22.559" style="s2">young man that&#39;s not in an active sexual</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.920" end="00:31:25.650" style="s2">relationship who may have loaf&#39; partner</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.559" end="00:31:27.809" style="s2">count and is not like gonna have more</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.650" end="00:31:29.940" style="s2">sexual fantasies than someone who&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.809" end="00:31:31.590" style="s2">you know these are just totally random</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.940" end="00:31:33.090" style="s2">examples versus somebody who&#39;s done like</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.590" end="00:31:34.410" style="s2">a consensually non-monogamous</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.090" end="00:31:35.850" style="s2">relationship who&#39;s having sex with</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.410" end="00:31:37.650" style="s2">multiple partners every week there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.850" end="00:31:40.470" style="s2">like Yuki there&#39;s no universal</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.650" end="00:31:42.720" style="s2">statements to be made there there are no</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.470" end="00:31:44.790" style="s2">universal principle we&#39;re not kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.720" end="00:31:47.520" style="s2">thing human sexuality you we can talk</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.790" end="00:31:49.650" style="s2">about you know trends on average but</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.520" end="00:31:51.360" style="s2">when you start looking at individuals</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.650" end="00:31:53.549" style="s2">there are always exceptions to the rule</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.360" end="00:31:55.169" style="s2">right I guess the image that I was</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.549" end="00:31:57.540" style="s2">trying to work through is so like you</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.169" end="00:31:59.580" style="s2">know a young man that may not have the</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.540" end="00:32:01.860" style="s2">sex that he&#39;s desiring the frequency or</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.580" end="00:32:05.220" style="s2">quality of you know I&#39;m wondering if</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.860" end="00:32:07.320" style="s2">they tend to be more more fantasy driven</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.220" end="00:32:09.870" style="s2">and overloaded with fantasy maybe even</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.320" end="00:32:11.309" style="s2">consumed by fantasy versus somebody</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.870" end="00:32:13.200" style="s2">that&#39;s like you would call sexually</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.309" end="00:32:15.870" style="s2">sated I would consider myself to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.200" end="00:32:17.970" style="s2">sexually sated like I can&#39;t remember you</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.870" end="00:32:19.799" style="s2">know the distant I&#39;m between like a</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.970" end="00:32:22.110" style="s2">sexual urge and my satisfaction of that</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.799" end="00:32:23.730" style="s2">urge is like so low they&#39;re like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.110" end="00:32:26.700" style="s2">even know that I have any time to like</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.730" end="00:32:28.169" style="s2">allow fantasies to bloom her or get to</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.700" end="00:32:30.059" style="s2">that point where it becomes like an urge</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.169" end="00:32:33.059" style="s2">right so I guess you would call an urge</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.059" end="00:32:34.140" style="s2">a desires I was sort of similar or it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.059" end="00:32:37.559" style="s2">not even a separate thing altogether</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.140" end="00:32:39.570" style="s2">urge no III dump it in the same category</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.559" end="00:32:41.760" style="s2">as a sexual desire you know thought I</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.570" end="00:32:43.650" style="s2">did you want to do Yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.760" end="00:32:44.820" style="s2">fascinating okay so what in the early</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.650" end="00:32:48.090" style="s2">things that you talked about in the book</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.820" end="00:32:50.640" style="s2">is the way that the medical profession</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.090" end="00:32:53.340" style="s2">has treated sexual fantasies and desires</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.640" end="00:32:56.250" style="s2">and fetishes and other things and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.340" end="00:32:57.570" style="s2">way that they&#39;ve labeled them and this</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.250" end="00:32:59.100" style="s2">word I&#39;ve been using a lot on you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.570" end="00:33:00.809" style="s2">if it&#39;s worth pathologized is that even</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.100" end="00:33:02.549" style="s2">word you know this type of behavior</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.809" end="00:33:03.690" style="s2">there&#39;s a word for it and can you give</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.549" end="00:33:06.630" style="s2">sort of like a just a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.690" end="00:33:09.600" style="s2">history on on the way that the the sect</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.630" end="00:33:11.700" style="s2">the the medical community has viewed</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.600" end="00:33:13.710" style="s2">these fantasies and these urges and such</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.700" end="00:33:16.440" style="s2">and and how they&#39;re classified and why</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.710" end="00:33:19.770" style="s2">and why it&#39;s an issue so we can trace</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.440" end="00:33:21.919" style="s2">this back to Sigmund Freud whose view on</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.770" end="00:33:24.540" style="s2">sexual fantasies was basically that</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.919" end="00:33:25.660" style="s2">happy people don&#39;t fantasize only people</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.540" end="00:33:29.620" style="s2">who are decide</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.660" end="00:33:31.950" style="s2">five and that wrong I know that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.620" end="00:33:34.270" style="s2">set the tone for people to think about</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.950" end="00:33:36.250" style="s2">for psychologists and psychiatrists to</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.270" end="00:33:39.580" style="s2">be thinking about sexual fantasies as is</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.250" end="00:33:41.230" style="s2">pathological and if you look at the way</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.580" end="00:33:43.450" style="s2">the the mental health community is</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.230" end="00:33:45.340" style="s2">treated sexual fantasies over time you</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.450" end="00:33:48.280" style="s2">see that they&#39;ve labeled fantasy after</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.340" end="00:33:50.020" style="s2">fantasy desire after desire as being</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.280" end="00:33:52.090" style="s2">what they call paraphilias if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.020" end="00:33:55.870" style="s2">something that strikes them as unusual</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.090" end="00:33:57.970" style="s2">or as outside of their perceived norms</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.870" end="00:33:59.410" style="s2">for for sex that they call it a</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.970" end="00:34:02.560" style="s2">paraphilia which just means unusual</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.410" end="00:34:04.030" style="s2">sexual interest and these paraphilias</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.560" end="00:34:06.880" style="s2">have made their way into the DSM which</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.030" end="00:34:08.860" style="s2">has the effect of of stigmatizing and by</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.880" end="00:34:10.330" style="s2">making people think that this hey this</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.860" end="00:34:13.450" style="s2">is weird and unusual because it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.330" end="00:34:16.960" style="s2">this medical manual and so sadism and</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.450" end="00:34:19.780" style="s2">masochism are two examples of the sexual</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.960" end="00:34:22.450" style="s2">interests that appear in the DSM that</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.780" end="00:34:24.580" style="s2">you know people think are weird</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.450" end="00:34:26.470" style="s2">for that reason because they are</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.580" end="00:34:28.929" style="s2">diagnoseable mental disorders and have</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.470" end="00:34:31.530" style="s2">been for decades right like an example</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.929" end="00:34:33.730" style="s2">of pretty common and very mild</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.530" end="00:34:35.380" style="s2">sadomasochistic behavior would be like a</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.730" end="00:34:37.660" style="s2">dude smacking a girl in the ass while</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.380" end="00:34:41.440" style="s2">they&#39;re having sex right right obviously</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.660" end="00:34:43.300" style="s2">you know BDSM can right there&#39;s a wide</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.440" end="00:34:44.590" style="s2">wide range for all that and we can talk</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.300" end="00:34:48.100" style="s2">about that later but I just wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.590" end="00:34:50.169" style="s2">sort of give context to what a physician</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.100" end="00:34:52.840" style="s2">a by-the-book physician who&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.169" end="00:34:54.550" style="s2">thinking outside of the sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.840" end="00:34:57.730" style="s2">Canon I guess the medical Canon there</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.550" end="00:35:00.370" style="s2">would perceive what you know my guys for</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.730" end="00:35:03.040" style="s2">sure and myself for sure for sure see as</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.370" end="00:35:06.460" style="s2">like a completely benign behavior as</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.040" end="00:35:08.290" style="s2">something that is is like mentally I</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.460" end="00:35:10.150" style="s2">mean come on I mean we will just say</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.290" end="00:35:12.400" style="s2">like paraphilic you mean that&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.150" end="00:35:14.260" style="s2">mental deficiency or a psychological</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.400" end="00:35:17.560" style="s2">deficiency or some sort of you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.260" end="00:35:19.510" style="s2">quote improper wrong behavior right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.560" end="00:35:20.980" style="s2">and for a long time when people have</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.510" end="00:35:22.990" style="s2">heard the term paraphilia it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.980" end="00:35:24.910" style="s2">synonymous with disorder you know it has</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.990" end="00:35:26.650" style="s2">meant that writes something mentally</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.910" end="00:35:29.020" style="s2">wrong with you and it wasn&#39;t until a</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.650" end="00:35:30.490" style="s2">couple of years ago that psychologists</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.020" end="00:35:32.620" style="s2">finally started making this distinction</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.490" end="00:35:34.960" style="s2">between people who have unusual sexual</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.620" end="00:35:36.839" style="s2">interests and people who have unusual</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.960" end="00:35:38.999" style="s2">sexual interests that are problematic</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.839" end="00:35:42.390" style="s2">that&#39;s really a new thing for the mental</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.999" end="00:35:43.680" style="s2">health community I yeah right I mean and</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.390" end="00:35:45.539" style="s2">we can clearly define like some of those</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.680" end="00:35:47.420" style="s2">things and this list will not be</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.539" end="00:35:50.039" style="s2">exhaustive but like bestiality</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.420" end="00:35:51.749" style="s2">necrophilia incest these kind of these</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.039" end="00:35:53.099" style="s2">kind of things are bad and they&#39;re bad</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.749" end="00:35:54.749" style="s2">for you and they&#39;re bad for the people</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.099" end="00:35:56.160" style="s2">who or objects or things that you would</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.749" end="00:36:00.029" style="s2">do them with right so we&#39;re not talking</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.160" end="00:36:02.099" style="s2">about like normalizing you know all</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.029" end="00:36:04.529" style="s2">types of sexual behaviors and whatnot</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.099" end="00:36:07.229" style="s2">but so we&#39;re we&#39;re in do you draw the</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.529" end="00:36:10.710" style="s2">line you personally as a researcher to</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.229" end="00:36:12.749" style="s2">it being and I&#39;ll say deviant in a</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.710" end="00:36:14.460" style="s2">technical sense right away from the norm</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.749" end="00:36:15.869" style="s2">but as we found in your book a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.460" end="00:36:17.160" style="s2">these things are completely normal to so</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.869" end="00:36:19.890" style="s2">but like we&#39;re where do you draw the</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.160" end="00:36:21.869" style="s2">line between what would be how would you</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.890" end="00:36:23.579" style="s2">characterize something that goes from</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.869" end="00:36:24.930" style="s2">being like a healthy sexual fantasy to</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.579" end="00:36:28.710" style="s2">something it becomes an unhealthy sexual</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.930" end="00:36:31.229" style="s2">fantasy for me the key things are first</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.710" end="00:36:33.479" style="s2">is their consent involved in this</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.229" end="00:36:35.130" style="s2">activity and with something like</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.479" end="00:36:36.719" style="s2">pedophilia you know when you&#39;re when</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.130" end="00:36:39.119" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about a prepubescent</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.719" end="00:36:42.559" style="s2">child they cannot consent to sex so that</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.119" end="00:36:44.759" style="s2">is always a problematic sexual desire</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.559" end="00:36:46.589" style="s2">you know I should mention that sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.759" end="00:36:48.989" style="s2">people will have a sexual fantasy about</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.589" end="00:36:50.400" style="s2">something that&#39;s non consensual but that</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.989" end="00:36:51.779" style="s2">doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that they want</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.400" end="00:36:53.400" style="s2">to act on it you know if it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.779" end="00:36:55.759" style="s2">one-time thing it&#39;s probably nothing to</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.400" end="00:36:57.509" style="s2">worry about but if you have a fantasy</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.759" end="00:36:59.549" style="s2">repeatedly and it becomes your favorite</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.509" end="00:37:01.710" style="s2">fantasy content and it&#39;s non-consensual</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.549" end="00:37:03.569" style="s2">that&#39;s when it starts to become a cause</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.710" end="00:37:06.180" style="s2">for concern because you might</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.569" end="00:37:08.759" style="s2">potentially act on it then the other</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.180" end="00:37:10.680" style="s2">issue is aside from consent is there a</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.759" end="00:37:12.599" style="s2">serious risk of harm to you or to</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.680" end="00:37:15.719" style="s2">someone else if you engaged in that</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.599" end="00:37:17.279" style="s2">behavior and you know most of the BDSM</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.719" end="00:37:19.289" style="s2">things for example that people fantasize</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.279" end="00:37:20.339" style="s2">about or not cause for concern but there</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.289" end="00:37:23.640" style="s2">are some people who fantasize about</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.339" end="00:37:26.219" style="s2">really intense activities where you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.640" end="00:37:27.630" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s cutting and electric</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.219" end="00:37:29.009" style="s2">shocks and other things like that and</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.630" end="00:37:31.619" style="s2">that&#39;s where you start to get into this</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.009" end="00:37:33.559" style="s2">area of you know safe sane and</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.619" end="00:37:36.719" style="s2">consensual and figuring out you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.559" end="00:37:38.309" style="s2">what is an appropriate videus I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.719" end="00:37:40.979" style="s2">related interest act on and what isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.309" end="00:37:43.529" style="s2">and that gets into a whole area that you</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.979" end="00:37:45.299" style="s2">know I it&#39;s hard to draw lines and say</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.529" end="00:37:46.619" style="s2">you know this is acceptable and this</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.299" end="00:37:49.170" style="s2">isn&#39;t because everybody has their</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.619" end="00:37:49.950" style="s2">different threshold for the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.170" end="00:37:52.920" style="s2">risk there will</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.950" end="00:37:55.290" style="s2">to take on so you know I just I tend to</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.920" end="00:38:00.420" style="s2">stick by go with safe sane consensual</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.290" end="00:38:02.099" style="s2">and legal and yeah right well I&#39;m one of</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.420" end="00:38:05.460" style="s2">the earlier pieces I ever wrote was</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.099" end="00:38:08.550" style="s2">based around this model for sexual</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.460" end="00:38:10.530" style="s2">health I was developed by Michael Vega</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.550" end="00:38:14.220" style="s2">Reno and Braun I can&#39;t remember his last</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.530" end="00:38:16.349" style="s2">name and the Bron Oh Harvey Harvey and</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.220" end="00:38:17.579" style="s2">bigger IDO yeah and so it was a model</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.349" end="00:38:19.170" style="s2">for sexual health that had six</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.579" end="00:38:20.430" style="s2">components and if it had these six</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.170" end="00:38:23.040" style="s2">components that it would then it was</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.430" end="00:38:25.050" style="s2">okay right the first one let me see if I</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.040" end="00:38:27.690" style="s2">can remember oh except up my head the</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.050" end="00:38:30.930" style="s2">first one was consent the sexual the</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.690" end="00:38:33.750" style="s2">second one was protection from pregnancy</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.930" end="00:38:34.980" style="s2">and st st d--&#39;s is what i grew up they</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.750" end="00:38:37.710" style="s2">were called oh no now they&#39;re called I</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.980" end="00:38:43.410" style="s2">guess the eyes or something</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.710" end="00:38:46.859" style="s2">mutually pleasurable jeez Oh Cheryl use</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.410" end="00:38:48.720" style="s2">non exploitive gosh and there&#39;s one more</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.859" end="00:38:51.329" style="s2">I can&#39;t remember but if you if you if</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.720" end="00:38:53.339" style="s2">you hit all six of these elements then</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.329" end="00:38:55.170" style="s2">their model for sexual health will say</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.339" end="00:38:57.359" style="s2">that this is a healthy a healthy baby</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.170" end="00:38:59.430" style="s2">and basically honesty that was fun</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.359" end="00:39:01.319" style="s2">that&#39;s a big that&#39;s a big one right so</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.430" end="00:39:02.760" style="s2">as long as you as long as your sexual</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.319" end="00:39:04.319" style="s2">behavior is falling under those six</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.760" end="00:39:05.760" style="s2">categories and you can check YES on each</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.319" end="00:39:07.200" style="s2">one of those you&#39;re not hurting anybody</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.760" end="00:39:08.730" style="s2">you&#39;re being totally upfront and honest</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.200" end="00:39:10.079" style="s2">about it both partners are getting what</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.730" end="00:39:12.270" style="s2">they want out of it both partners are</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.079" end="00:39:13.890" style="s2">getting pleasure out of it and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.270" end="00:39:17.730" style="s2">not lying cheating and stealing to make</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.890" end="00:39:20.640" style="s2">it happen then you know it&#39;s it&#39;s a-okay</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.730" end="00:39:21.930" style="s2">and and and I think when I wrote that it</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.640" end="00:39:23.880" style="s2">was actually really useful because the</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.930" end="00:39:25.500" style="s2">world am i writing early writing came</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.880" end="00:39:26.849" style="s2">from was like around guys like trying to</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.500" end="00:39:28.800" style="s2">figure out how to have relationships and</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.849" end="00:39:30.930" style="s2">meet girls and at the same time it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.800" end="00:39:32.250" style="s2">like how do i bed women and then you</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.930" end="00:39:33.839" style="s2">know after a while you start doing it</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.250" end="00:39:35.310" style="s2">enough and you become proficient in it</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.839" end="00:39:36.930" style="s2">like meeting and sleeping with women</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.310" end="00:39:39.060" style="s2">then all then then you start to think is</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.930" end="00:39:41.700" style="s2">this right is what I mean what I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.060" end="00:39:43.410" style="s2">healthy and so it was really important</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.700" end="00:39:45.000" style="s2">for me to get that model out there for</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.410" end="00:39:46.740" style="s2">guys and and I can&#39;t tell you the amount</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.000" end="00:39:49.530" style="s2">of positive feedback I got from people</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.740" end="00:39:52.680" style="s2">who were happy to have a framework to</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.530" end="00:39:53.940" style="s2">analyze their own behavior and safe sane</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.680" end="00:39:55.950" style="s2">and consensual it&#39;s a it&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.940" end="00:39:58.050" style="s2">shorthand way of putting it that comes</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.950" end="00:39:58.980" style="s2">from the BDSM community for sure so</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.050" end="00:40:00.660" style="s2">that&#39;s what we&#39;re talking about we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.980" end="00:40:02.980" style="s2">talking about things that are going to</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.660" end="00:40:05.020" style="s2">fall under these categories</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.980" end="00:40:07.599" style="s2">especially in your in your actions right</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.020" end="00:40:08.829" style="s2">because I at least believe partially</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.599" end="00:40:11.619" style="s2">that we can&#39;t be held accountable for</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.829" end="00:40:13.660" style="s2">our thoughts so it&#39;s really just about</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.619" end="00:40:15.849" style="s2">our actions and stuff so that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.660" end="00:40:17.800" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about and and and and the</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.849" end="00:40:20.050" style="s2">weird part of this story is that even</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.800" end="00:40:21.730" style="s2">activities that fall under those</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.050" end="00:40:24.369" style="s2">guidelines and that meet that criteria</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.730" end="00:40:26.609" style="s2">we&#39;re still being defined as something</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.369" end="00:40:29.650" style="s2">as this paraphilic right which is a</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.609" end="00:40:31.510" style="s2">negative it&#39;s in the book your your</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.650" end="00:40:33.550" style="s2">deviant and maybe even deranged for even</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.510" end="00:40:35.829" style="s2">thinking about these things and have we</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.550" end="00:40:38.829" style="s2">seen any have any of these activities</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.829" end="00:40:40.990" style="s2">come out of the manual and and been</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.829" end="00:40:42.880" style="s2">unlabeled as paraphilic I mean have we</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.990" end="00:40:44.260" style="s2">seen an evolution and thinking there</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.880" end="00:40:46.930" style="s2">yeah and that just goes to show how</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.260" end="00:40:50.800" style="s2">subjective the term paraphilia actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.930" end="00:40:52.900" style="s2">is so one example is homosexuality was</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.800" end="00:40:55.750" style="s2">listed as a paraphilia in the dsm until</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.900" end="00:40:57.760" style="s2">the early 1970s and at that point it was</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.750" end="00:40:59.470" style="s2">taken out and for about a decade it was</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.760" end="00:41:02.560" style="s2">replaced with this different category</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.470" end="00:41:05.890" style="s2">called ego-dystonic homosexuality which</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.560" end="00:41:07.540" style="s2">referred people who were had same-sex</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.890" end="00:41:09.130" style="s2">attractions who were uncomfortable with</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.540" end="00:41:10.839" style="s2">them and wanted to change and then</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.130" end="00:41:12.010" style="s2">people still looked at that and said</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.839" end="00:41:13.329" style="s2">well it&#39;s still stigmatizing</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.010" end="00:41:14.980" style="s2">homosexuality please who saw this</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.329" end="00:41:19.119" style="s2">listing for it in there so that came out</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.980" end="00:41:21.280" style="s2">in the early 80s now outside of the DSM</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.119" end="00:41:23.800" style="s2">I&#39;ve got a book on my shelf that lists</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.280" end="00:41:26.109" style="s2">more than 500 different paraphilias and</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.800" end="00:41:27.970" style="s2">it includes oral sex and anal sex and</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.109" end="00:41:29.980" style="s2">basically you know anything other than</p>

<p begin="00:41:29.980" end="00:41:35.109" style="s2">calling a paraphilia so for for</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.780" end="00:41:38.200" style="s2">procreation or any anything outside of</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.109" end="00:41:39.760" style="s2">procreative missionary right right well</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.200" end="00:41:41.319" style="s2">um that you know that&#39;s interesting that</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.760" end="00:41:44.020" style="s2">you bring up sort of the researchers</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.319" end="00:41:46.450" style="s2">perspective or the the writer of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.020" end="00:41:48.550" style="s2">manual like if it falls outside of what</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.450" end="00:41:50.829" style="s2">they feel like is normal then all of a</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.550" end="00:41:53.470" style="s2">sudden it&#39;s not normal for anybody and I</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.829" end="00:41:56.079" style="s2">I get the feeling that a lot and I feel</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.470" end="00:41:58.000" style="s2">like I feel like psychology is big is</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.079" end="00:42:00.910" style="s2">having it&#39;s like pants pulled down these</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.000" end="00:42:03.520" style="s2">days like to that reveal a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.910" end="00:42:06.369" style="s2">personal biases and and a lack of</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.520" end="00:42:08.170" style="s2">objectivity and we&#39;re seeing that now</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.369" end="00:42:10.690" style="s2">like with these gender roles and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.170" end="00:42:14.050" style="s2">too and yeah it gets infected with</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.690" end="00:42:15.060" style="s2">politics and ideology and sexuality has</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.050" end="00:42:18.840" style="s2">certainly been in fact</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.060" end="00:42:21.720" style="s2">with religion and moral codes and and</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.840" end="00:42:23.550" style="s2">judgment and such and all of which are</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.720" end="00:42:25.470" style="s2">fascinating to me and this is probably a</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.550" end="00:42:27.270" style="s2">subject for another another podcast but</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.470" end="00:42:28.500" style="s2">like where where did those initial</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.270" end="00:42:30.600" style="s2">feelings come from where do these ideas</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.500" end="00:42:32.580" style="s2">of disgust come from where do those</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.600" end="00:42:34.080" style="s2">norms and stuff come from like why why</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.580" end="00:42:34.410" style="s2">were they there were they healthy for us</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.080" end="00:42:37.170" style="s2">or not</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.410" end="00:42:39.930" style="s2">but I certainly am one I consider myself</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.170" end="00:42:41.670" style="s2">to be sex positive like I believe that</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.930" end="00:42:42.930" style="s2">to healthy adults can consent to do</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.670" end="00:42:44.400" style="s2">whatever they want to do with each other</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.930" end="00:42:46.290" style="s2">and and I&#39;m all for it</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.400" end="00:42:48.420" style="s2">like and I&#39;m certainly probably the most</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.290" end="00:42:50.580" style="s2">sex positive guy in my little sphere</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.420" end="00:42:52.380" style="s2">which is which gets me a lot of flack</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.580" end="00:42:54.210" style="s2">sometimes and people come across my like</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.380" end="00:42:56.040" style="s2">conservative political writing and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.210" end="00:42:57.750" style="s2">they then the next day they&#39;re seeing me</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.040" end="00:42:59.190" style="s2">on Twitter talking about sex positive</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.750" end="00:43:00.450" style="s2">stuff and they&#39;re like uh-oh what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.190" end="00:43:03.210" style="s2">happening here and then I get unfollowed</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.450" end="00:43:07.290" style="s2">so I&#39;m definitely cultivating a unique</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.210" end="00:43:09.300" style="s2">following here so the book that moves</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.290" end="00:43:11.100" style="s2">away from talking about the pair of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.300" end="00:43:13.020" style="s2">defining elements of the paraphilic</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.100" end="00:43:15.660" style="s2">nature and into your sort of main</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.020" end="00:43:17.910" style="s2">findings and you know let&#39;s talk about</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.660" end="00:43:21.000" style="s2">that because I think that&#39;s the fun part</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.910" end="00:43:23.250" style="s2">for sure what what would what were your</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.000" end="00:43:24.660" style="s2">main findings or you know you know how</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.250" end="00:43:26.100" style="s2">to present your work here so like let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.660" end="00:43:28.260" style="s2">give it people an introduction to what</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.100" end="00:43:29.850" style="s2">what you found and what you saw and and</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.260" end="00:43:31.110" style="s2">then we can we can go through there</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.850" end="00:43:33.000" style="s2">because I think there&#39;s some also some</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.110" end="00:43:34.610" style="s2">really tremendously health concepts that</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.000" end="00:43:37.080" style="s2">you were able to glean out of this data</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.610" end="00:43:38.310" style="s2">so the first thing I looked at is you</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.080" end="00:43:40.590" style="s2">know what are the most common things</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.310" end="00:43:42.270" style="s2">that people are fantasizing about and I</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.590" end="00:43:44.550" style="s2">found that there were three themes that</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.270" end="00:43:45.390" style="s2">that almost everybody reported having at</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.550" end="00:43:48.330" style="s2">one time or another</p>

<p begin="00:46:35.609" end="00:46:39.210" style="s2">definitely put my personal stamp of</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.349" end="00:46:42.270" style="s2">approval on that one confirmed in the in</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.210" end="00:46:44.430" style="s2">the field no question about that but</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.270" end="00:46:47.520" style="s2">did you find that there was a skew male</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.430" end="00:46:51.120" style="s2">or female on dominant versus submissive</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.520" end="00:46:53.850" style="s2">and then what does the Venn diagram look</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.120" end="00:46:55.800" style="s2">like of people that were fantasized of</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.850" end="00:46:57.300" style="s2">dominance like you guys can&#39;t see this</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.800" end="00:46:59.910" style="s2">on the podcast but I got my hands on</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.300" end="00:47:01.680" style="s2">that diagram the the Venn diagram it</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.910" end="00:47:03.630" style="s2">looks like people that that that were</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.680" end="00:47:05.070" style="s2">fantasize about dominance and Submission</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.630" end="00:47:07.590" style="s2">and then like the total population</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.070" end="00:47:10.230" style="s2">because I would I would think that you</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.590" end="00:47:12.060" style="s2">would have some sort of balance but many</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.230" end="00:47:13.980" style="s2">or not perfectly and that but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.060" end="00:47:15.660" style="s2">almost everybody right like that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.980" end="00:47:18.210" style="s2">my guess what did you find</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.660" end="00:47:20.010" style="s2">yeah I&#39;d say more often than not people</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.210" end="00:47:22.140" style="s2">are you know what you could call</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.010" end="00:47:23.400" style="s2">switches in the sense that you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.140" end="00:47:25.200" style="s2">sometimes they&#39;re fantasizing about</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.400" end="00:47:26.910" style="s2">dominance sometimes they&#39;re fantasizing</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.200" end="00:47:28.470" style="s2">about submission yeah there are some</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.910" end="00:47:30.030" style="s2">people who are at the extreme ends for</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.470" end="00:47:31.980" style="s2">they only fantasize about taking on a</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.030" end="00:47:33.480" style="s2">dominant role some who only fantasize</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.980" end="00:47:35.310" style="s2">about taking on a submissive role but</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.480" end="00:47:37.950" style="s2">you know people tend to be a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.310" end="00:47:39.270" style="s2">more in the middle in terms of sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.950" end="00:47:41.490" style="s2">they&#39;re feeling more this way sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.270" end="00:47:45.690" style="s2">they&#39;re feeling more the other way right</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.490" end="00:47:47.520" style="s2">so could just put a number on the total</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.690" end="00:47:49.170" style="s2">number of people or the the percentage</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.520" end="00:47:51.350" style="s2">of people that fantasize about power</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.170" end="00:47:53.700" style="s2">dynamics in their sexual relationship</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.350" end="00:47:57.660" style="s2">just in terms of the dominant submissive</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.700" end="00:48:00.180" style="s2">dynamic it was I think it was 80% or</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.660" end="00:48:01.800" style="s2">more who had had those fantasies they I</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.180" end="00:48:03.060" style="s2">can&#39;t recall the specific numbers off</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.800" end="00:48:04.470" style="s2">the top of my shirt there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.060" end="00:48:06.150" style="s2">numbers in the book I don&#39;t mean to put</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.470" end="00:48:07.890" style="s2">you on the spot with that no there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.150" end="00:48:09.090" style="s2">many and I&#39;ve actually I&#39;m in the midst</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.890" end="00:48:10.770" style="s2">of going around the country right now</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.090" end="00:48:12.870" style="s2">and I&#39;m teaching these workshops on the</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.770" end="00:48:14.790" style="s2">the science of sexual fantasies for sex</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.870" end="00:48:17.070" style="s2">therapists to try and give them the the</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.790" end="00:48:19.230" style="s2">sex education that maybe they didn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.070" end="00:48:21.030" style="s2">in graduate school and I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.230" end="00:48:23.010" style="s2">presenting table after table and so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.030" end="00:48:25.170" style="s2">got so many numbers hold at my head</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.010" end="00:48:27.480" style="s2">right now I can&#39;t keep them all straight</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.170" end="00:48:29.730" style="s2">I can imagine I can imagine but be but</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.480" end="00:48:32.670" style="s2">basically I&#39;m at it&#39;s really starting to</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.730" end="00:48:34.710" style="s2">snow here in Washington DC basically you</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.670" end="00:48:36.570" style="s2">know 80 or 90 percent of people have</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.710" end="00:48:40.170" style="s2">fantasized about some element of a power</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.570" end="00:48:41.910" style="s2">of a consensual power exchange happening</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.170" end="00:48:44.670" style="s2">within their relation within their</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.910" end="00:48:46.830" style="s2">sexual relationship and but let&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.670" end="00:48:49.200" style="s2">know I think people get scared when they</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.830" end="00:48:50.940" style="s2">hear the phrase BDSM and the first thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.200" end="00:48:53.040" style="s2">that pops into their their minds are</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.940" end="00:48:55.290" style="s2">like people like dressed up in leather</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.040" end="00:48:56.640" style="s2">with those funny like motorcycle</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.290" end="00:48:58.290" style="s2">hats on and then the you know beating</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.640" end="00:48:59.940" style="s2">each other up and people are tied to</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.290" end="00:49:02.250" style="s2">crosses and stuff like that and getting</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.940" end="00:49:04.470" style="s2">set on fire or whatever but like can you</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.250" end="00:49:08.370" style="s2">put can you put BDSM in context for like</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.470" end="00:49:10.260" style="s2">sort of air quotes normal people yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.370" end="00:49:12.810" style="s2">I think most people when they hear BDSM</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.260" end="00:49:15.360" style="s2">they get this sort of extreme imagery in</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.810" end="00:49:18.150" style="s2">mind like it like you said but for most</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.360" end="00:49:21.390" style="s2">people who are into BDSM it&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.150" end="00:49:23.700" style="s2">mild pretty symbolic especially when it</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.390" end="00:49:25.470" style="s2">comes to something like like pain so so</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.700" end="00:49:29.340" style="s2">spanking is one of the more common forms</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.470" end="00:49:31.770" style="s2">of BDSM or tying a partner up you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.340" end="00:49:32.940" style="s2">using handcuffs or or maybe just you</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.770" end="00:49:34.950" style="s2">know holding their hands behind their</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.940" end="00:49:36.390" style="s2">back biting them on the neck you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.950" end="00:49:40.320" style="s2">there are so many different ways that</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.390" end="00:49:42.300" style="s2">this can play out that range from you</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.320" end="00:49:43.860" style="s2">know the mild to wild but most people</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.300" end="00:49:46.650" style="s2">tend to be on that more mild end of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.860" end="00:49:48.030" style="s2">spectrum right right and I think I mean</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.650" end="00:49:50.010" style="s2">I think statistically that that makes</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.030" end="00:49:52.650" style="s2">sense so when but when I mean I used to</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.010" end="00:49:55.410" style="s2">bright I&#39;d use the term BDSM I think I</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.650" end="00:49:57.000" style="s2">probably turn some people off because in</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.410" end="00:49:59.820" style="s2">their minds are having these images but</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.000" end="00:50:01.950" style="s2">really what I&#39;m talking about is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.820" end="00:50:04.110" style="s2">what you&#39;re describing is like light</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.950" end="00:50:06.000" style="s2">bondage which could involve handcuffs or</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.110" end="00:50:08.400" style="s2">maybe some ropes or maybe just like pull</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.000" end="00:50:09.660" style="s2">a tie off of your tie rack or something</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.400" end="00:50:11.550" style="s2">like that or even just holding</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.660" end="00:50:13.830" style="s2">somebody&#39;s hands down behind their head</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.550" end="00:50:15.510" style="s2">or something I suppose like pulling</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.830" end="00:50:16.860" style="s2">hairs probably somewhere in that</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.510" end="00:50:18.480" style="s2">spectrum yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.860" end="00:50:21.450" style="s2">and then when it comes to like the S&amp;M</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.480" end="00:50:23.490" style="s2">part I mean man lights banks maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.450" end="00:50:25.590" style="s2">paddle maybe light whipped with a</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.490" end="00:50:27.420" style="s2">flogger but you know nothing nothing</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.590" end="00:50:29.490" style="s2">that&#39;s meant to like leave any lasting</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.420" end="00:50:32.430" style="s2">marks or caused any bruises or anything</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.490" end="00:50:34.770" style="s2">and you know I think when people examine</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.430" end="00:50:36.360" style="s2">the true functionality and their own</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.770" end="00:50:37.710" style="s2">sexual relationships they&#39;ll find some</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.360" end="00:50:39.690" style="s2">of these elements in there that they</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.710" end="00:50:42.330" style="s2">didn&#39;t even really ever think about as</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.690" end="00:50:43.950" style="s2">being BDSM you know I like to put my</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.330" end="00:50:45.300" style="s2">hands down on her shoulders and pin her</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.950" end="00:50:46.890" style="s2">down into the ground while we&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.300" end="00:50:48.630" style="s2">sex what you can&#39;t move oh well you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.890" end="00:50:51.330" style="s2">that&#39;s you know that would probably fall</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.630" end="00:50:53.550" style="s2">under this category right yeah and I</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.330" end="00:50:55.350" style="s2">think a lot of people are exactly right</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.550" end="00:50:57.870" style="s2">they don&#39;t necessarily think about their</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.350" end="00:50:59.040" style="s2">behaviors in those terms but if they</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.870" end="00:51:01.320" style="s2">went back with a broader understanding</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.040" end="00:51:02.670" style="s2">they might say oh yeah you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.320" end="00:51:04.410" style="s2">turned on by the same things that a lot</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.670" end="00:51:06.660" style="s2">of other people are and this can break</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.410" end="00:51:07.840" style="s2">out in a lot of different ways right so</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.660" end="00:51:12.040" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.840" end="00:51:14.380" style="s2">what do you attribute where where does</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.040" end="00:51:16.840" style="s2">this come from where where is it where</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.380" end="00:51:18.400" style="s2">do people what causes people to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.840" end="00:51:19.660" style="s2">interested in power dynamics when</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.400" end="00:51:22.270" style="s2">they&#39;re having sex and what causes</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.660" end="00:51:25.330" style="s2">people to find arousal and either</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.270" end="00:51:26.890" style="s2">delivering or receiving pain of some you</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.330" end="00:51:28.420" style="s2">know to some degree like where does that</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.890" end="00:51:30.010" style="s2">come from because you know I believe</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.420" end="00:51:31.810" style="s2">that we&#39;ve evolved over all this time</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.010" end="00:51:34.330" style="s2">and some of these things serve a</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.810" end="00:51:36.610" style="s2">function for us or harken back to like</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.330" end="00:51:38.170" style="s2">some some period of time in the past</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.610" end="00:51:39.820" style="s2">that you know where things were more</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.170" end="00:51:41.710" style="s2">common like what where do you think what</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.820" end="00:51:44.980" style="s2">do you think it comes from the way that</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.710" end="00:51:46.780" style="s2">I look at the popularity BDSM is that</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.980" end="00:51:48.850" style="s2">much of it has to do with the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.780" end="00:51:51.370" style="s2">it changes your mental state and it</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.850" end="00:51:54.160" style="s2">allows you to get lost in the moment</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.370" end="00:51:56.830" style="s2">become very absorbed in a way that you</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.160" end="00:52:00.910" style="s2">can maintain arousal and just enjoy the</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.830" end="00:52:03.010" style="s2">sexual experience and without getting</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.910" end="00:52:04.840" style="s2">pulled out of it and losing that arousal</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.010" end="00:52:06.520" style="s2">and then not reaching orgasm and so</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.840" end="00:52:09.370" style="s2">forth so I think it&#39;s often just about</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.520" end="00:52:11.140" style="s2">creating that state of absorption and we</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.370" end="00:52:13.660" style="s2">have some really fascinating research</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.140" end="00:52:15.850" style="s2">where they&#39;ve you know observed people</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.660" end="00:52:17.590" style="s2">who are engaged in BDSM rituals and then</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.850" end="00:52:19.750" style="s2">they give them different psychological</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.590" end="00:52:21.970" style="s2">tasks to do at different points during</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.750" end="00:52:24.160" style="s2">that ritual so that they can see what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.970" end="00:52:26.440" style="s2">happening you know mentally for them and</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.160" end="00:52:28.240" style="s2">we see that from people who are taking</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.440" end="00:52:29.710" style="s2">on dominant roles they enter this state</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.240" end="00:52:32.290" style="s2">of what&#39;s called flow where they just</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.710" end="00:52:35.050" style="s2">have this enhanced concentration so they</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.290" end="00:52:36.820" style="s2">mmm if this high level of focus whereas</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.050" end="00:52:39.910" style="s2">people who take a submissive role or a</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.820" end="00:52:42.220" style="s2">masochistic role they experience often</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.910" end="00:52:43.420" style="s2">like the state of spirituality where</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.220" end="00:52:45.670" style="s2">it&#39;s like they&#39;re sort of like floating</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.420" end="00:52:47.380" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s a very different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.670" end="00:52:50.350" style="s2">absorption and so yeah we call it we</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.380" end="00:52:51.370" style="s2">call that subspace yeah yeah so there</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.350" end="00:52:53.710" style="s2">are different terms that people in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.370" end="00:52:54.820" style="s2">community use versus just it&#39;s all the</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.710" end="00:52:57.610" style="s2">same thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.820" end="00:52:58.930" style="s2">but I think that that change in mental</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.610" end="00:53:00.520" style="s2">state is appealing to a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.930" end="00:53:02.650" style="s2">because so many of us just get</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.520" end="00:53:04.330" style="s2">distracted during sex and that takes us</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.650" end="00:53:06.910" style="s2">out of the moment and this is a way of</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.330" end="00:53:08.860" style="s2">keeping us in there yeah I&#39;m gonna jump</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.910" end="00:53:10.900" style="s2">ahead because you brought this up now</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.860" end="00:53:12.490" style="s2">and this is this is one of what I found</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.900" end="00:53:14.020" style="s2">to be one of the best takeaways and I</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.490" end="00:53:18.460" style="s2">was tweeting about this the other day as</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.020" end="00:53:20.500" style="s2">I was reading it basically my my big</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.460" end="00:53:22.330" style="s2">take out of a lot of this was</p>

<p begin="00:53:30.580" end="00:53:33.880" style="s2">things you know we didn&#39;t talk about</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.500" end="00:53:36.520" style="s2">this now but it&#39;s in the book definitely</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.880" end="00:53:38.530" style="s2">group sex with multiple people there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.520" end="00:53:40.710" style="s2">increased level of stimulation there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.530" end="00:53:43.660" style="s2">visual stimulation physical stimulation</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.710" end="00:53:46.900" style="s2">emotional stimulation for sure where</p>

<p begin="00:53:59.700" end="00:54:05.680" style="s2">status for that&#39;s such a strong word as</p>

<p begin="00:54:08.920" end="00:54:13.180" style="s2">you&#39;re focused on the flash on the</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.930" end="00:54:14.980" style="s2">redness on the safety of your partner on</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.180" end="00:54:17.410" style="s2">whether they&#39;re good you&#39;re checking in</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.980" end="00:54:19.530" style="s2">with them you know you really it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.410" end="00:54:22.480" style="s2">really all about like a sexual</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.530" end="00:54:24.700" style="s2">mindfulness and what can you talk about</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.480" end="00:54:26.770" style="s2">some of your findings with that or did</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.700" end="00:54:28.060" style="s2">you come to some same I mean I&#39;m sort of</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.770" end="00:54:29.740" style="s2">borrowing you paraphrasing you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.060" end="00:54:31.750" style="s2">writing here so what talk about your</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.740" end="00:54:32.800" style="s2">perception on that and and how you sort</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.750" end="00:54:37.690" style="s2">of came to that as well</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.800" end="00:54:39.190" style="s2">so this is an idea in sexuality research</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.690" end="00:54:43.030" style="s2">in theory that&#39;s been around for a long</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.190" end="00:54:45.580" style="s2">time that when people can find a way to</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.030" end="00:54:47.470" style="s2">be in the here and now they just they</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.580" end="00:54:50.440" style="s2">have fewer problems when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.470" end="00:54:52.390" style="s2">sexual performance because so many of us</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.440" end="00:54:54.700" style="s2">have performance anxiety and</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.390" end="00:54:56.050" style="s2">insecurities about our bodies or you</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.700" end="00:54:59.020" style="s2">know wondering whether we&#39;re good at sex</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.050" end="00:55:01.690" style="s2">or not and we all need to find a way to</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.020" end="00:55:03.460" style="s2">kind of get in the moment be in the here</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.690" end="00:55:04.840" style="s2">and now and we see there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.460" end="00:55:06.310" style="s2">research on this in recent years</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.840" end="00:55:08.020" style="s2">specifically looking at this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.310" end="00:55:10.480" style="s2">mindfulness and whether we can you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.020" end="00:55:11.920" style="s2">sort of train people to to do this and</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.480" end="00:55:13.570" style="s2">there are all kinds of ways that you can</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.920" end="00:55:15.370" style="s2">achieve that state of mindfulness one is</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.570" end="00:55:17.530" style="s2">through BDSM practices and other is</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.370" end="00:55:19.510" style="s2">through you know doing breathing and</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.530" end="00:55:20.880" style="s2">other sorts of exercises based on you</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.510" end="00:55:24.250" style="s2">know classic mindfulness trade</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.880" end="00:55:26.740" style="s2">traditions but but yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.250" end="00:55:29.200" style="s2">about that that getting lost in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.740" end="00:55:32.500" style="s2">moment so many of us need that to enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.200" end="00:55:34.390" style="s2">sex well I think that so many of us need</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.500" end="00:55:36.640" style="s2">increased levels of mindful</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.390" end="00:55:39.309" style="s2">in all aspects of our lives I mean we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.640" end="00:55:42.099" style="s2">overwhelmed by stimuli look at how fancy</p>

<p begin="00:56:40.180" end="00:56:44.769" style="s2">definitely within a sexual experience</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.799" end="00:56:46.720" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s you know I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.769" end="00:56:50.440" style="s2">gotten into sex workshops yet but I</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.720" end="00:56:54.519" style="s2">think I can see it in my future but like</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.440" end="00:56:57.279" style="s2">you know I think so many men are racing</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.519" end="00:56:59.319" style="s2">towards orgasm because they&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.279" end="00:57:01.539" style="s2">they&#39;re focused and and and actually</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.319" end="00:57:04.299" style="s2">guys that is not being focused on sex</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.539" end="00:57:06.430" style="s2">right like racing towards orgasm is is</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.299" end="00:57:08.289" style="s2">being focused on the finish and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.430" end="00:57:09.759" style="s2">focused on an event that is outside of</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.289" end="00:57:11.920" style="s2">like the thing that you&#39;re doing right</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.759" end="00:57:13.480" style="s2">now and at the same time I was learning</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.920" end="00:57:15.819" style="s2">about BDSM I was learning about Tantra</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.480" end="00:57:18.069" style="s2">also and like Tantra quirk where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.819" end="00:57:20.410" style="s2">really it really is like yoga sex yoga</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.069" end="00:57:22.180" style="s2">it&#39;s amazing where where you really take</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.410" end="00:57:24.759" style="s2">the time to focus you take the time to</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.180" end="00:57:27.789" style="s2">breathe and you take the time to be in</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.759" end="00:57:30.250" style="s2">the moment in the act you know an act</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.789" end="00:57:32.319" style="s2">that you&#39;re doing at the time and so</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.250" end="00:57:34.869" style="s2">like its penetration for example and</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.319" end="00:57:36.490" style="s2">then like one of the one of them one of</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.869" end="00:57:38.500" style="s2">the activities that I first learned</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.490" end="00:57:40.539" style="s2">about in order to enhance this this</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.500" end="00:57:42.309" style="s2">ability to become present during sex was</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.539" end="00:57:45.279" style="s2">to like just insert the penis into the</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.309" end="00:57:47.930" style="s2">vagina and then just chill right just</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.279" end="00:57:50.720" style="s2">like hang out with your partner</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.930" end="00:57:52.700" style="s2">at that in that state and just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.720" end="00:57:54.470" style="s2">see what happens to your bodies and man</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.700" end="00:57:57.049" style="s2">if you do that you will find that your</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.470" end="00:57:59.119" style="s2">body your your erection becomes more</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.049" end="00:58:02.480" style="s2">pronounced the vagina becomes more</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.119" end="00:58:04.309" style="s2">swollen and and lubricated and it opens</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.480" end="00:58:07.010" style="s2">the vagina opens up it becomes deeper</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.309" end="00:58:09.980" style="s2">and and like there&#39;s just a deeper sense</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.010" end="00:58:12.950" style="s2">of connection and so I&#39;m I was really</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.980" end="00:58:15.349" style="s2">really excited to see that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.950" end="00:58:17.510" style="s2">conclusions at least that I drew from a</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.349" end="00:58:20.000" style="s2">book was this increased sense of</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.510" end="00:58:21.920" style="s2">presence and this increased sense of</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.000" end="00:58:25.099" style="s2">mindfulness will lead not only to like a</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.920" end="00:58:26.750" style="s2">decrease in in your sexual anxiety it</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.099" end="00:58:29.089" style="s2">will increase your ability to perform</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.750" end="00:58:30.890" style="s2">but it&#39;s also going to increase your</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.089" end="00:58:32.150" style="s2">just overall enjoyment and could</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.890" end="00:58:34.430" style="s2">possibly take you to places that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.150" end="00:58:36.980" style="s2">never been before so that&#39;s my that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.430" end="00:58:40.520" style="s2">sort of a technical note practice sort</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.980" end="00:58:41.960" style="s2">of rare rant rant here and BDSM does the</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.520" end="00:58:43.940" style="s2">same thing the group sex is over</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.960" end="00:58:45.589" style="s2">stimulation and there was one there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.940" end="00:58:48.559" style="s2">another third component I think that you</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.589" end="00:58:50.990" style="s2">found was one of the more frequently had</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.559" end="00:58:53.180" style="s2">fantasies and what was that that was the</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.990" end="00:58:55.369" style="s2">novelty adventure and variety you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.180" end="00:58:56.990" style="s2">just going out buying something new and</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.369" end="00:58:58.730" style="s2">different and trying to fend off</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.990" end="00:59:00.289" style="s2">something that sex researchers called</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.730" end="00:59:02.809" style="s2">the Coolidge effect which is basically</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.289" end="00:59:05.359" style="s2">this idea that tend to become less</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.809" end="00:59:08.210" style="s2">aroused so the same stimulus over time</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.359" end="00:59:09.859" style="s2">so for example in studies where men can</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.210" end="00:59:11.660" style="s2">you can you can you give the can you</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.859" end="00:59:16.010" style="s2">tell the story it&#39;s about fluid effect</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.660" end="00:59:19.730" style="s2">yeah say the one more thing about how it</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.010" end="00:59:21.529" style="s2">works is that if men and women watch the</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.730" end="00:59:23.690" style="s2">same porn clip every day for a week they</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.529" end="00:59:24.920" style="s2">show less arousal to it over time but if</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.690" end="00:59:26.359" style="s2">you showed them a new clip with new</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.920" end="00:59:29.059" style="s2">actors then they get really excited</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.359" end="00:59:30.500" style="s2">again so that&#39;s the idea behind the</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.059" end="00:59:32.450" style="s2">Coolidge effect it&#39;s named after a</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.500" end="00:59:35.119" style="s2">former President Calvin Coolidge and</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.450" end="00:59:36.950" style="s2">it&#39;s this comes from this anecdote about</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.119" end="00:59:39.829" style="s2">him and the first lady visiting a</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.950" end="00:59:41.480" style="s2">chicken farm and they&#39;re going on a tour</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.829" end="00:59:44.660" style="s2">of it and the first lady gets ahead of</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.480" end="00:59:47.000" style="s2">her husband and she sees this rooster</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.660" end="00:59:48.200" style="s2">who&#39;s has a lot of sexual prowess you</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.000" end="00:59:50.839" style="s2">know he&#39;s going from one hand to the</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.200" end="00:59:52.579" style="s2">next and you know just she&#39;s impressed</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.839" end="00:59:53.569" style="s2">by it so it shoots up with the tour</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.579" end="00:59:54.890" style="s2">guide you&#39;d be sure to point that</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.569" end="00:59:57.440" style="s2">rooster out to my husband when he gets</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.890" end="00:59:59.270" style="s2">here so the tour guide does when when</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.440" end="01:00:00.859" style="s2">President Coolidge gets to that part of</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.270" end="01:00:01.680" style="s2">the tour he says your wife wanted me to</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.859" end="01:00:04.380" style="s2">be sure the point this</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.680" end="01:00:06.630" style="s2">throughout to you and mr. Coolidge sits</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.380" end="01:00:08.280" style="s2">there looks of what&#39;s going on and he</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.630" end="01:00:10.470" style="s2">says be sure to tell mrs. Coolidge that</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.280" end="01:00:12.030" style="s2">there&#39;s more than one hand you know yeah</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.470" end="01:00:13.680" style="s2">the only reason that that rooster was</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.030" end="01:00:16.349" style="s2">was getting it on so much is because he</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.680" end="01:00:17.609" style="s2">had a lot of options right and I can</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.349" end="01:00:19.440" style="s2">speak from personal experience that that</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.609" end="01:00:22.470" style="s2">is an actual real-life thing and I</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.440" end="01:00:25.740" style="s2">definitely read other like evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.470" end="01:00:29.190" style="s2">biology studies and such that that we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.740" end="01:00:31.319" style="s2">talk about when the man has like</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.190" end="01:00:33.059" style="s2">multiple partners or even perceives that</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.319" end="01:00:35.160" style="s2">the woman has had other partners or</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.059" end="01:00:37.020" style="s2">there&#39;s a new partner or I think in your</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.160" end="01:00:39.030" style="s2">book you even cite like even if you just</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.020" end="01:00:42.750" style="s2">are masturbating to a different porn</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.030" end="01:00:45.450" style="s2">star you have increased like ejaculated</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.750" end="01:00:48.300" style="s2">and Seamon levels I mean it&#39;s built into</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.450" end="01:00:50.550" style="s2">us some way and I&#39;ve found at least</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.300" end="01:00:52.650" style="s2">personally that a lot of the things that</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.550" end="01:00:54.630" style="s2">I found to be most sexually satisfying</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.650" end="01:00:57.839" style="s2">in terms of acting out these fantasies</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.630" end="01:01:00.510" style="s2">is are are things that that I call them</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.839" end="01:01:02.970" style="s2">like bio hacks they like tap into</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.510" end="01:01:05.099" style="s2">something that&#39;s in our circuitry for</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.970" end="01:01:07.319" style="s2">whatever reason but you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.099" end="01:01:08.369" style="s2">changing your physiology around and</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.319" end="01:01:11.099" style="s2">you&#39;re actually getting a greater</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.369" end="01:01:13.770" style="s2">stimulation sexually and it causes for a</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.099" end="01:01:16.290" style="s2">more intense more pleasurable experience</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.770" end="01:01:18.410" style="s2">and that Coolidge story the cool story</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.290" end="01:01:20.640" style="s2">cracks me up because it&#39;s also very</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.410" end="01:01:23.849" style="s2">quintessential sort of male versus</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.640" end="01:01:27.299" style="s2">female sexual perspective if you if you</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.849" end="01:01:29.520" style="s2">adhere to the sort of variety the</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.299" end="01:01:32.910" style="s2">argument about fur for men and the way</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.520" end="01:01:35.520" style="s2">that it stimulates them and he brought</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.910" end="01:01:36.299" style="s2">up something else that I was highlighted</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.520" end="01:01:40.010" style="s2">on my list</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.299" end="01:01:42.750" style="s2">and that was a attenuation so I</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.010" end="01:01:44.010" style="s2">personally and one of the things that</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.750" end="01:01:46.020" style="s2">I&#39;ve always prided myself on my writing</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.010" end="01:01:48.720" style="s2">is that I was very revealing and I</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.020" end="01:01:50.940" style="s2">revealed my own sexual history and my</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.720" end="01:01:52.650" style="s2">own sexual experience and one of the one</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.940" end="01:01:56.280" style="s2">of the things I noted personally was</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.650" end="01:01:57.059" style="s2">that like okay so I had you know anal</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.280" end="01:01:59.250" style="s2">sex okay</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.059" end="01:02:01.230" style="s2">did that all right and then I had sex</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.250" end="01:02:03.000" style="s2">outside okay I did that and then I had a</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.230" end="01:02:07.260" style="s2">threesome I don&#39;t know anymore and then</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.000" end="01:02:09.119" style="s2">and then the stimulation required to get</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.260" end="01:02:10.980" style="s2">that same novelty effect or the same</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.119" end="01:02:13.020" style="s2">whatever effect it was became sort of</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.980" end="01:02:15.190" style="s2">greater and greater and that&#39;s when I</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.020" end="01:02:17.829" style="s2">that&#39;s when I sought out like a healthy</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.190" end="01:02:19.810" style="s2">actual model to operate under to make</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.829" end="01:02:21.520" style="s2">sure that as I was pursuing these like</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.810" end="01:02:23.260" style="s2">greater and greater sexual fantasies</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.520" end="01:02:25.930" style="s2">that they were still healthy and sane</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.260" end="01:02:27.819" style="s2">and consensual himself so you mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.930" end="01:02:32.140" style="s2">this in terms of pornography</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.819" end="01:02:34.690" style="s2">no I did a whole podcast with dr. David</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.140" end="01:02:38.680" style="s2">Leigh about pornography and the impact</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.690" end="01:02:40.150" style="s2">on men pornography on men masturbation</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.680" end="01:02:44.050" style="s2">and the effect of masturbation on man</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.150" end="01:02:45.400" style="s2">etc and I I don&#39;t know and I&#39;m gonna put</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.050" end="01:02:48.540" style="s2">words in his mouth and I may be wrong</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.400" end="01:02:50.890" style="s2">but I feel like he argued that</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.540" end="01:02:53.079" style="s2">pornography did not necessarily have</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.890" end="01:02:54.910" style="s2">that same effect but I could be wrong</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.079" end="01:02:57.520" style="s2">I&#39;ll go back and listen so David sorry</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.910" end="01:02:58.540" style="s2">if you&#39;re listening the and I know and I</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.520" end="01:03:01.990" style="s2">know he will</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.540" end="01:03:03.520" style="s2">the what did you find what studies did</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.990" end="01:03:05.349" style="s2">you cite please talk about that because</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.520" end="01:03:06.640" style="s2">I know a lot of guys are concerned that</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.349" end="01:03:07.720" style="s2">they&#39;re like okay I&#39;m jerking off for</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.640" end="01:03:09.940" style="s2">this now there&#39;s three of them now</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.720" end="01:03:11.589" style="s2">there&#39;s ten women now I can only get off</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.940" end="01:03:13.450" style="s2">to jerking off to like a hundred women</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.589" end="01:03:14.980" style="s2">all wearing cat suits with butchered</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.450" end="01:03:17.680" style="s2">knives and you know peeing on each other</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.980" end="01:03:21.579" style="s2">or whatever so like what what did you</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.680" end="01:03:22.780" style="s2">did he that&#39;s a good one I&#39;m gonna what</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.579" end="01:03:24.609" style="s2">what did you find like what kind of</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.780" end="01:03:27.069" style="s2">study did you see and and how do you see</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.609" end="01:03:29.770" style="s2">I playing out in terms of porn use and</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.069" end="01:03:34.540" style="s2">sexual fantasies Wow okay that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.770" end="01:03:35.980" style="s2">complex question so you know the idea</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.540" end="01:03:38.319" style="s2">behind the Coolidge effect is that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.980" end="01:03:40.900" style="s2">just we&#39;re turned on by novelty and so</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.319" end="01:03:42.790" style="s2">what that means in terms of porn use is</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.900" end="01:03:44.410" style="s2">that we&#39;re just we&#39;re not gonna want to</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.790" end="01:03:46.540" style="s2">watch the same thing over and over and</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.410" end="01:03:49.300" style="s2">over again that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.540" end="01:03:52.690" style="s2">though that we are going to need to amp</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.300" end="01:03:54.940" style="s2">up the intensity level of it right okay</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.690" end="01:03:57.849" style="s2">thing new and different so that could be</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.940" end="01:04:00.819" style="s2">a new actor you know actress performers</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.849" end="01:04:03.010" style="s2">it could be you know having sex in a new</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.819" end="01:04:05.560" style="s2">setting or location you know there are</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.010" end="01:04:08.950" style="s2">all kinds of ways that had a new twist</p>

<p begin="01:04:13.359" end="01:04:17.950" style="s2">is as dangerous and I think this is</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.730" end="01:04:19.599" style="s2">where we you know the sex addiction</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.950" end="01:04:21.550" style="s2">people come in and they start</p>

<p begin="01:04:30.779" end="01:04:38.089" style="s2">some research I believe by my colleague</p>

<p begin="01:04:58.170" end="01:05:03.059" style="s2">sorts of foreign as well right so the</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.289" end="01:05:04.980" style="s2">data isn&#39;t consistent with that idea</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.059" end="01:05:07.349" style="s2">that you know there&#39;s necessarily this</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.980" end="01:05:08.730" style="s2">escalation effect that if you watch a</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.349" end="01:05:10.529" style="s2">little bit of poor and that makes you</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.730" end="01:05:12.329" style="s2">just you know you can never shut it off</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.529" end="01:05:13.589" style="s2">and you have to keep going to some more</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.329" end="01:05:16.829" style="s2">and more people more and more intense</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.589" end="01:05:19.200" style="s2">activities right and at least personally</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.829" end="01:05:21.450" style="s2">I can I can say that that that didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.200" end="01:05:23.549" style="s2">happen to me and like honestly like my</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.450" end="01:05:25.170" style="s2">poor news has really gone down quite a</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.549" end="01:05:26.910" style="s2">bit and I&#39;ve always wondered about the</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.170" end="01:05:29.160" style="s2">correlation between poor news and actual</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.910" end="01:05:32.190" style="s2">sexual activity David said that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.160" end="01:05:34.049" style="s2">no there&#39;s no relationship I don&#39;t know</p>

<p begin="01:05:47.880" end="01:05:51.569" style="s2">a certain point at which you know you&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="01:05:57.029" end="01:06:02.119" style="s2">point where like to go to go into the</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.390" end="01:06:05.339" style="s2">next layer of fantasy there&#39;s it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:06:50.930" end="01:06:55.070" style="s2">to you when he&#39;s masturbating at all but</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.300" end="01:06:56.300" style="s2">when he&#39;s masturbating and you know to a</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.070" end="01:06:58.310" style="s2">woman on the screen</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.300" end="01:07:00.920" style="s2">he&#39;s definitely cheating on you I mean</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.310" end="01:07:04.010" style="s2">I&#39;ve heard all that I&#39;ve heard that in</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.920" end="01:07:05.720" style="s2">couples therapy with my ex-wife and the</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.010" end="01:07:07.790" style="s2">60 year old women sitting across from me</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.720" end="01:07:09.200" style="s2">telling her that I was cheating on on my</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.790" end="01:07:10.580" style="s2">ex-wife because I was masturbating to</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.200" end="01:07:11.920" style="s2">pornography cuz my wife won&#39;t have sex</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.580" end="01:07:13.490" style="s2">with me but anyway that&#39;s the no story</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.920" end="01:07:16.400" style="s2">that&#39;s another story</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.490" end="01:07:18.860" style="s2">so this novelty effect is not and it I</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.400" end="01:07:21.200" style="s2">had written down attenuation was that me</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.860" end="01:07:23.420" style="s2">without my word did you it was that word</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.200" end="01:07:27.050" style="s2">in your boat habituation is what I was a</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.420" end="01:07:28.480" style="s2">publication okay and and do you think</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.050" end="01:07:31.010" style="s2">that there&#39;s any relationship between</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.480" end="01:07:37.850" style="s2">sexual anxiety and failure to perform</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.010" end="01:07:42.410" style="s2">and porn usage and well what causal</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.850" end="01:07:44.690" style="s2">direction that&#39;s a very thank you for</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.410" end="01:07:46.220" style="s2">saying it that way so your question</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.690" end="01:07:47.660" style="s2">implies that maybe people that have</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.220" end="01:07:49.220" style="s2">sexual dysfunction then seek out</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.660" end="01:07:51.560" style="s2">pornography in order to masturbate on</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.220" end="01:07:52.880" style="s2">their own because they can&#39;t perform not</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.560" end="01:07:54.440" style="s2">the other way around that they&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.880" end="01:07:57.980" style="s2">pornography and that causes the</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.440" end="01:07:59.210" style="s2">dysfunction yeah and this is one of</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.980" end="01:08:00.920" style="s2">those things that&#39;s hard to study</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.210" end="01:08:05.120" style="s2">scientifically and tease apart which</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.920" end="01:08:07.010" style="s2">which direction it is so yeah I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.120" end="01:08:09.110" style="s2">know that I have a good answer for that</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.010" end="01:08:10.100" style="s2">because we don&#39;t necessarily have great</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.110" end="01:08:12.650" style="s2">data on it yet</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.100" end="01:08:15.200" style="s2">yeah oh this brings up a question I</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.650" end="01:08:17.180" style="s2">asked David to which was are there any</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.200" end="01:08:19.160" style="s2">studies and if the answer is no that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.180" end="01:08:20.870" style="s2">fine and if there answer&#39;s no and you</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.160" end="01:08:22.730" style="s2">want me to be a subject in this study I</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.870" end="01:08:25.220" style="s2">will definitely do it is there any</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.730" end="01:08:27.410" style="s2">correlation at all that or is there a</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.220" end="01:08:30.589" style="s2">difference in the physiological response</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.410" end="01:08:33.140" style="s2">that you have to orgasm in different</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.589" end="01:08:35.450" style="s2">situations such as solo masturbation</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.140" end="01:08:38.120" style="s2">with no pornography solo masturbation</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.450" end="01:08:40.370" style="s2">with pornography masturbation in the</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.120" end="01:08:43.490" style="s2">presence of another woman mutual</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.370" end="01:08:45.230" style="s2">masturbation intercourse like are the</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.490" end="01:08:48.410" style="s2">hormonal and physiological</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.230" end="01:08:50.029" style="s2">responses to each of those the same do</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.410" end="01:08:52.130" style="s2">they have the same impact on us do they</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.029" end="01:08:56.180" style="s2">boost our testosterone do they SAP our</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.130" end="01:08:58.430" style="s2">energy do they release oxytocin like is</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.180" end="01:09:00.620" style="s2">it orgasm just an orgasm or is the</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.430" end="01:09:03.620" style="s2">context and the stimulation is that</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.620" end="01:09:05.150" style="s2">relevant as well based on my</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.620" end="01:09:07.160" style="s2">understanding of the data and I should</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.150" end="01:09:09.560" style="s2">back up and say that orgasm science is</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.160" end="01:09:11.120" style="s2">not where it needs to be because Masters</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.560" end="01:09:13.270" style="s2">and Johnson did sort of the pioneering</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.120" end="01:09:15.410" style="s2">work on this back in the 1960s and then</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.270" end="01:09:18.200" style="s2">there wasn&#39;t a whole lot of research on</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.410" end="01:09:20.180" style="s2">orgasms until very recently and a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.200" end="01:09:22.250" style="s2">what Masters and Johnson said it turns</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.180" end="01:09:24.500" style="s2">out you know when we&#39;re starting to</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.250" end="01:09:28.850" style="s2">reset e this we&#39;re coming to some</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.500" end="01:09:30.739" style="s2">different conclusions and so I think my</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.850" end="01:09:34.359" style="s2">understanding of the data is that an</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.739" end="01:09:36.080" style="s2">orgasm is an orgasm physiologically but</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.359" end="01:09:38.480" style="s2">psychologically it might be a very</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.080" end="01:09:41.839" style="s2">different experience you know you can</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.480" end="01:09:44.180" style="s2">have different feeling orgasms based on</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.839" end="01:09:46.580" style="s2">your state of arousal or what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.180" end="01:09:49.460" style="s2">doing or what substances you consume</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.580" end="01:09:51.470" style="s2">right so the the physiology is there and</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.460" end="01:09:53.779" style="s2">it&#39;s always the same but the psychology</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.470" end="01:09:55.310" style="s2">is different and in the mindfulness is</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.779" end="01:09:58.280" style="s2">you know sort of part of it you know are</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.310" end="01:10:00.260" style="s2">you and present and fully enjoying that</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.280" end="01:10:02.900" style="s2">pleasure like that can affect the</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.260" end="01:10:04.790" style="s2">quality of the orgasm you have right I</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.900" end="01:10:07.780" style="s2">guess the the reason that I bring it up</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.790" end="01:10:10.070" style="s2">is because a lot of guys on the</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.780" end="01:10:11.900" style="s2">definitely the more conservative side of</p>

<p begin="01:11:44.670" end="01:11:51.150" style="s2">moving on moving on um let&#39;s see I want</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.110" end="01:11:53.880" style="s2">to talk about impact on the realization</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.150" end="01:11:57.059" style="s2">of your fantasies on your fantasies so</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.880" end="01:12:00.599" style="s2">you know do your fantasies change once</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.059" end="01:12:02.219" style="s2">you&#39;ve achieved or experience them in</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.599" end="01:12:04.079" style="s2">real life and then what does that</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.219" end="01:12:06.780" style="s2">process like and is there as there a</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.079" end="01:12:09.570" style="s2">path like what happens that&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.780" end="01:12:11.369" style="s2">question and you know this is a case</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.570" end="01:12:13.530" style="s2">where we could really use longitudinal</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.369" end="01:12:15.630" style="s2">data on sexual fantasies where we could</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.530" end="01:12:17.400" style="s2">see over time what happens when you</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.630" end="01:12:19.559" style="s2">share this fantasy and then when you act</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.400" end="01:12:22.260" style="s2">on that fantasy and then does that lead</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.559" end="01:12:23.760" style="s2">to change in subsequent fantasies we</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.260" end="01:12:25.619" style="s2">don&#39;t have the data to be able to do</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.760" end="01:12:28.170" style="s2">that that wasn&#39;t something I was able to</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.619" end="01:12:29.429" style="s2">collect as part of my study but as I</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.170" end="01:12:31.889" style="s2">mentioned a little earlier people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.429" end="01:12:34.079" style="s2">fantasies do change as they age and</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.889" end="01:12:35.909" style="s2">maybe that is in part because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.079" end="01:12:38.280" style="s2">acting and achieving some of those</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.909" end="01:12:39.440" style="s2">fantasies and as a result developing new</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.280" end="01:12:41.849" style="s2">fantasies from there</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.440" end="01:12:44.699" style="s2">what&#39;s your hunch forget about the data</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.849" end="01:12:46.289" style="s2">I always want data you know I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.699" end="01:12:48.300" style="s2">scientist and I like to speak based on</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.289" end="01:12:52.380" style="s2">data whenever I can but you know my</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.300" end="01:12:55.320" style="s2">prediction would be that if you acted on</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.380" end="01:12:57.059" style="s2">a fantasy and the experience didn&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.320" end="01:12:59.249" style="s2">well you know it was it didn&#39;t live up</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.059" end="01:13:00.960" style="s2">to your expectations then I think maybe</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.249" end="01:13:03.119" style="s2">you&#39;ve replaced that with a different</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.960" end="01:13:04.829" style="s2">fantasy but you know acted on it and it</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.119" end="01:13:06.510" style="s2">was really good maybe you&#39;d keep</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.829" end="01:13:08.159" style="s2">fantasizing about it because you want to</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.510" end="01:13:10.559" style="s2">keep repeating that experience or maybe</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.159" end="01:13:11.770" style="s2">you add a new twist to it yeah well I</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.559" end="01:13:15.010" style="s2">found for me it&#39;s definite</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.770" end="01:13:17.380" style="s2">adding a twist adding a twist like I</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.010" end="01:13:21.370" style="s2">said my fantasies have gotten farm far</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.380" end="01:13:23.860" style="s2">more complex when I can&#39;t you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.370" end="01:13:25.420" style="s2">personally I&#39;m very dominant and so my</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.860" end="01:13:27.190" style="s2">sex partners are looking to me to like</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.420" end="01:13:30.850" style="s2">lead the way anyway so like part of my</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.190" end="01:13:33.280" style="s2">job my sex job is to be creative and is</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.850" end="01:13:34.750" style="s2">to be a leader in the bedroom and I</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.280" end="01:13:36.220" style="s2">think that that&#39;s one element that</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.750" end="01:13:38.860" style="s2">people lose sight of when they talk</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.220" end="01:13:41.440" style="s2">about dominance Submission like the the</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.860" end="01:13:44.650" style="s2">dominant person is a leader in the</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.440" end="01:13:47.050" style="s2">sexual activity in a way but you&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.650" end="01:13:50.140" style="s2">sort of submitted submitted huh</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.050" end="01:13:52.150" style="s2">submissive to the to your partner&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.140" end="01:13:53.590" style="s2">desires to because you&#39;re you may be</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.150" end="01:13:55.840" style="s2">dominated leading the way but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.590" end="01:13:57.760" style="s2">also have their fantasy in mind too so</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.840" end="01:14:00.400" style="s2">like there&#39;s a responsibility that comes</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.760" end="01:14:01.960" style="s2">with being dominant and in charge of</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.400" end="01:14:04.150" style="s2">your sexual experience and so therefore</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.960" end="01:14:06.010" style="s2">you kind of if you do it long enough and</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.150" end="01:14:08.500" style="s2">you&#39;re any good at it and you develop a</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.010" end="01:14:11.080" style="s2">real process you you you begin to become</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.500" end="01:14:12.970" style="s2">more creative and come up with twists of</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.080" end="01:14:15.400" style="s2">more ideas when I think of some of my</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.970" end="01:14:17.530" style="s2">earlier 3 some fantasies versus the ones</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.400" end="01:14:19.810" style="s2">that I have now which involves like well</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.530" end="01:14:21.100" style="s2">no I&#39;ll leave that out but they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.810" end="01:14:24.040" style="s2">definitely they&#39;ve definitely gotten</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.100" end="01:14:28.060" style="s2">more complex so the next thing that I</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.040" end="01:14:30.370" style="s2">had on my list was the political your</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.060" end="01:14:33.040" style="s2">political perspectives your political</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.370" end="01:14:35.830" style="s2">parties your Trump voters versus your</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.040" end="01:14:39.220" style="s2">Clinton voters versus you know how did</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.830" end="01:14:41.710" style="s2">you see political leanings impact</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.220" end="01:14:43.440" style="s2">people&#39;s fantasies and/or realizations</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.710" end="01:14:45.910" style="s2">because I feel like we&#39;re also not</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.440" end="01:14:47.620" style="s2">haven&#39;t yet delineated between fantasy</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.910" end="01:14:51.010" style="s2">and realization I think that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.620" end="01:14:52.600" style="s2">wide gap to you know to cross write so</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.010" end="01:14:54.700" style="s2">well what we&#39;ll keep talking about</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.600" end="01:14:57.310" style="s2">fantasy so what did you find in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.700" end="01:15:00.700" style="s2">people&#39;s political affiliations or</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.310" end="01:15:04.000" style="s2">ideologies and their sexual fantasies so</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.700" end="01:15:07.420" style="s2">my data were collected 2014 to 2016 so</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.000" end="01:15:10.870" style="s2">it was before the recent presidential</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.420" end="01:15:13.270" style="s2">election and what I found was that</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.870" end="01:15:16.390" style="s2">self-identified Republicans were more</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.270" end="01:15:18.900" style="s2">likely to fantasize about a wide range</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.390" end="01:15:22.010" style="s2">of taboo sexual activities as well as</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.900" end="01:15:25.220" style="s2">infidelity and orgies and</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.010" end="01:15:26.810" style="s2">cuckolding as well swinging too so you</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.220" end="01:15:28.460" style="s2">know it was sort of the multi-partner</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.810" end="01:15:30.890" style="s2">activities the partner swapping</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.460" end="01:15:33.050" style="s2">activities in the taboo stuff I found</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.890" end="01:15:36.590" style="s2">were more common among the Republicans</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.050" end="01:15:37.790" style="s2">among self-identified Democrats the area</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.590" end="01:15:40.430" style="s2">where I saw the biggest difference there</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.790" end="01:15:42.530" style="s2">was that they were more into BDSM so I</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.430" end="01:15:44.120" style="s2">saw you know some differences and what</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.530" end="01:15:47.960" style="s2">people are fantasizing about based on</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.120" end="01:15:49.520" style="s2">their political leanings Wow okay that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.960" end="01:15:52.790" style="s2">fascinating let&#39;s dig into that a little</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.520" end="01:15:56.030" style="s2">bit so I presumably self-described</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.790" end="01:15:57.739" style="s2">Republicans I&#39;m just assuming here and</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.030" end="01:16:00.890" style="s2">correct me if I&#39;m wrong may have a</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.739" end="01:16:03.830" style="s2">tendency to to be a higher rate of</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.890" end="01:16:06.739" style="s2">marriage more strictly adhere to</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.830" end="01:16:10.489" style="s2">monogamy maybe got married earlier maybe</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.739" end="01:16:12.770" style="s2">have more kids maybe a wider maybe are</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.489" end="01:16:14.450" style="s2">more religious right like all the</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.770" end="01:16:17.570" style="s2">stereotypes but actually they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.450" end="01:16:18.800" style="s2">actually true and so they&#39;re living a</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.570" end="01:16:20.120" style="s2">life where they&#39;re married and they have</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.800" end="01:16:23.510" style="s2">kids and maybe they&#39;re going to church</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.120" end="01:16:25.910" style="s2">and they&#39;re they&#39;re not having a wide</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.510" end="01:16:28.070" style="s2">range of sexual experiences so like</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.910" end="01:16:29.960" style="s2">they&#39;re thinking about like stepping out</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.070" end="01:16:31.630" style="s2">on their wife but not you know maybe</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.960" end="01:16:34.460" style="s2">consensually but like some sort of</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.630" end="01:16:37.460" style="s2">extramarital affairs like a level of</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.460" end="01:16:40.910" style="s2">novelty and such there but absent in</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.460" end="01:16:44.690" style="s2">those fantasies is BDSM like power</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.910" end="01:16:46.370" style="s2">exchanges and the SNM or submissive</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.690" end="01:16:48.710" style="s2">dominance you know it&#39;s not to say that</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.370" end="01:16:51.080" style="s2">it&#39;s absent it&#39;s just that statistically</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.710" end="01:16:52.610" style="s2">it was less common for Republicans more</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.080" end="01:16:55.670" style="s2">common for Democrats to fantasize about</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.610" end="01:16:57.830" style="s2">BDSM I got it so David David and I</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.670" end="01:17:00.590" style="s2">talked about this as well and he told me</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.830" end="01:17:03.590" style="s2">he told me that the reason the reason</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.590" end="01:17:05.690" style="s2">that Republicans don&#39;t have a less of a</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.590" end="01:17:07.600" style="s2">tendency to fantasize about dominant</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.690" end="01:17:10.160" style="s2">submissive relationships because</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.600" end="01:17:12.530" style="s2">traditional relationships are inherently</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.160" end="01:17:15.650" style="s2">dominant and submissive what do you</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.530" end="01:17:18.140" style="s2">think about that makes sense I mean yeah</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.650" end="01:17:21.160" style="s2">I guess I can&#39;t argue with that I hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.140" end="01:17:25.610" style="s2">thought about it but hey maybe it&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.160" end="01:17:26.989" style="s2">yeah yeah I right oh so I&#39;m gonna tie</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.610" end="01:17:28.790" style="s2">this together when we go over to the</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.989" end="01:17:30.230" style="s2">other side right and I think my</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.790" end="01:17:30.820" style="s2">conclusion something that you wrote</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.230" end="01:17:33.130" style="s2">about and can</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.820" end="01:17:36.520" style="s2">so then on the Democratic side on the</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.130" end="01:17:38.680" style="s2">liberal side more interest in BDSM which</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.520" end="01:17:40.570" style="s2">includes power exchanges and also</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.680" end="01:17:42.760" style="s2">includes a little bit more physical</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.570" end="01:17:46.630" style="s2">aggression and some dominance and stuff</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.760" end="01:17:49.240" style="s2">and so my the way that I look at it is</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.630" end="01:17:50.770" style="s2">because the Democrats are constantly the</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.240" end="01:17:53.260" style="s2">progressive especially constantly</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.770" end="01:17:56.680" style="s2">seeking equality in all things at all</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.260" end="01:17:59.710" style="s2">times so then when they argue having sex</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.680" end="01:18:02.560" style="s2">they can act out on their fantasies of</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.710" end="01:18:04.930" style="s2">actually things being unequal of power</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.560" end="01:18:06.190" style="s2">exchange is actually taking place and is</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.930" end="01:18:08.800" style="s2">there anything in your research that</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.190" end="01:18:10.540" style="s2">that will I can confirm that suspicions</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.800" end="01:18:12.520" style="s2">cuz I&#39;m one of the first things I ever</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.540" end="01:18:14.710" style="s2">wrote that I got in a ton of trouble for</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.520" end="01:18:17.080" style="s2">and I still get I still get for all</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.710" end="01:18:19.510" style="s2">the time it was titled up do feminists</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.080" end="01:18:21.880" style="s2">have rape fantasies and like my personal</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.510" end="01:18:25.630" style="s2">experience is hell yeah they do and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.880" end="01:18:27.490" style="s2">found that some of the the the most</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.630" end="01:18:29.380" style="s2">sexually open-minded women that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.490" end="01:18:31.750" style="s2">ever encountered self-identified as</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.380" end="01:18:33.880" style="s2">Democrats feminists intersectional as</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.750" end="01:18:36.190" style="s2">like as far left as you could possibly</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.880" end="01:18:38.260" style="s2">be and so like I found personally I like</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.190" end="01:18:39.610" style="s2">to have sex with the progressives and I</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.260" end="01:18:42.520" style="s2">like to hang out with conservatives I</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.610" end="01:18:44.110" style="s2">don&#39;t know it&#39;s just my preferences but</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.520" end="01:18:46.960" style="s2">is there anything in your data that can</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.110" end="01:18:48.640" style="s2">like give some credence to that like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.960" end="01:18:50.080" style="s2">a progressive I believe in equality at</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.640" end="01:18:51.280" style="s2">all things except in the bedroom where I</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.080" end="01:18:54.520" style="s2">want to get thrown around by a big</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.280" end="01:18:56.770" style="s2">strong man yeah so your your</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.520" end="01:18:59.730" style="s2">interpretation of it is something that I</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.770" end="01:19:02.200" style="s2">have argued before in other places about</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.730" end="01:19:03.790" style="s2">you know espousing these ideals of</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.200" end="01:19:05.910" style="s2">equality and then you know sort of</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.790" end="01:19:08.950" style="s2">playing with them sexually as a way of</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.910" end="01:19:12.280" style="s2">you know sort of dealing with that I</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.950" end="01:19:14.560" style="s2">I think a way to make sense of that and</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.280" end="01:19:16.060" style="s2">and what also helps to make sense of why</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.560" end="01:19:18.790" style="s2">Republicans had more of the taboo</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.060" end="01:19:20.440" style="s2">fantasies is that ultimately you know</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.790" end="01:19:23.410" style="s2">we&#39;re turned on by taboos and what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.440" end="01:19:26.290" style="s2">told we shouldn&#39;t do and I think for</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.410" end="01:19:28.300" style="s2">Democrats when you&#39;re adhering to those</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.290" end="01:19:29.890" style="s2">ideals of equality and the playing field</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.300" end="01:19:30.340" style="s2">is perfectly level for everyone all the</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.890" end="01:19:32.920" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.340" end="01:19:35.050" style="s2">it becomes very transgressive to you</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.920" end="01:19:37.960" style="s2">know have that dominant submissive power</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.050" end="01:19:39.670" style="s2">dynamic and so I think that it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.960" end="01:19:43.240" style="s2">the taboo element that makes it</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.670" end="01:19:44.090" style="s2">appealing right so it we want the thing</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.240" end="01:19:45.290" style="s2">that we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.090" end="01:19:46.880" style="s2">basically is what it comes down to</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.290" end="01:19:49.010" style="s2">you&#39;re right yeah and I think you see</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.880" end="01:19:51.050" style="s2">that in the the areas where Republicans</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.010" end="01:19:52.310" style="s2">are reporting certain fantasies more</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.050" end="01:19:53.900" style="s2">than Democrats where I say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.310" end="01:19:55.820" style="s2">non-monogamy or group-sex you know</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.900" end="01:19:56.990" style="s2">they&#39;re more moral restrictions placed</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.820" end="01:19:59.510" style="s2">on what they can do</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.990" end="01:20:00.890" style="s2">sexually many of them do based on what</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.510" end="01:20:02.420" style="s2">they&#39;re told by their religious</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.890" end="01:20:04.880" style="s2">teachings or so forth and so it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.420" end="01:20:06.740" style="s2">it&#39;s ultimately that that taboo more</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.880" end="01:20:09.020" style="s2">than anything oh my god I just got</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.740" end="01:20:10.880" style="s2">bowled over by a thought that I had that</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.020" end="01:20:14.060" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna change my entire worldview</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.880" end="01:20:16.430" style="s2">okay I don&#39;t even want to speak</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.060" end="01:20:19.640" style="s2">this into existence but here I go</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.430" end="01:20:21.700" style="s2">so basically if I can deduce from what</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.640" end="01:20:25.580" style="s2">we&#39;re just talking about here that our</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.700" end="01:20:29.090" style="s2">social constructs on the right or the</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.580" end="01:20:31.220" style="s2">left influence our thinking and</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.090" end="01:20:33.440" style="s2">influence our sexual urges and our</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.220" end="01:20:34.910" style="s2">fantasies which is sort of like our</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.440" end="01:20:39.760" style="s2">biology right mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.910" end="01:20:44.150" style="s2">oh my god so I I have been a very ardent</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.760" end="01:20:46.910" style="s2">non Blake slater determinist right and I</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.150" end="01:20:49.670" style="s2">just had a friggin Epiphany just now</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.910" end="01:20:52.520" style="s2">where we&#39;re clearly describing social</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.670" end="01:20:55.040" style="s2">constructs and sort of you know not non</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.520" end="01:20:58.390" style="s2">biologically related sort of endeavours</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.040" end="01:21:00.860" style="s2">that have a direct impact on the</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.390" end="01:21:02.900" style="s2">biochemistry in our brain and the way</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.860" end="01:21:04.100" style="s2">that we think and the way that we feel</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.900" end="01:21:06.350" style="s2">and the way that we express those</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.100" end="01:21:08.870" style="s2">feelings from a social construct and</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.350" end="01:21:10.640" style="s2">when you can compare two separate social</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.870" end="01:21:15.290" style="s2">constructs they come up with different</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.640" end="01:21:19.370" style="s2">results in humans oh man I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.290" end="01:21:21.200" style="s2">how I feel about that I mean I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.370" end="01:21:23.570" style="s2">have to take a little bit of time to</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.200" end="01:21:25.040" style="s2">process this I&#39;m gonna take a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.570" end="01:21:26.930" style="s2">of time to process this that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.040" end="01:21:28.730" style="s2">bumming me out actually but that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.930" end="01:21:30.500" style="s2">this podcast is all about man it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.730" end="01:21:32.690" style="s2">about exploring these ideas and and</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.500" end="01:21:34.280" style="s2">honest-to-god if I can come away from</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.690" end="01:21:35.630" style="s2">the end of a conversation with my mind</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.280" end="01:21:37.460" style="s2">changed on something then I know that</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.630" end="01:21:38.660" style="s2">I&#39;m a better man for it and I&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.460" end="01:21:42.200" style="s2">something so I do</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.660" end="01:21:45.590" style="s2">I do appreciate these moments so if if</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.200" end="01:21:49.670" style="s2">we take this logic and and and took it</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.590" end="01:21:52.460" style="s2">to its extreme if we released the taboo</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.670" end="01:21:54.980" style="s2">on all of these sort of safe sane</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.460" end="01:21:57.739" style="s2">consensual sexual activities</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.980" end="01:22:00.800" style="s2">I guess fantasies would uh when fancies</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.739" end="01:22:02.480" style="s2">go down like in it and this is totally</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.800" end="01:22:04.130" style="s2">hypothetical total thought exercise</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.480" end="01:22:07.130" style="s2">right like if you were a hundred percent</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.130" end="01:22:10.610" style="s2">sexually sated would you have would you</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.130" end="01:22:12.170" style="s2">have sexual fantasies like with those</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.610" end="01:22:14.570" style="s2">continued if you could if you could just</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.170" end="01:22:16.700" style="s2">snap your fingers which some of us can</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.570" end="01:22:19.730" style="s2">and have any kind of sexual activity you</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.700" end="01:22:21.290" style="s2">want do you do you see do you see or</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.730" end="01:22:23.420" style="s2">would you predict what your hunch just</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.290" end="01:22:25.940" style="s2">us guys talking about what it would it</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.420" end="01:22:27.650" style="s2">would not take don&#39;t beside this what</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.940" end="01:22:29.300" style="s2">would it what would it do to you your</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.650" end="01:22:31.100" style="s2">fantasies would the increase/decrease</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.300" end="01:22:33.410" style="s2">would to become more elaborate when they</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.100" end="01:22:35.150" style="s2">go away like what do you think well I</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.410" end="01:22:37.100" style="s2">guess that depends what you mean by</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.150" end="01:22:39.620" style="s2">sexually sated you know it&#39;s it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.100" end="01:22:42.800" style="s2">because you you finally had that fantasy</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.620" end="01:22:43.790" style="s2">that one fantasy fulfilled or is it</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.800" end="01:22:46.690" style="s2">because you&#39;re worn out and exhausted</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.790" end="01:22:49.130" style="s2">because you had so much sex or true</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.690" end="01:22:51.110" style="s2">that&#39;s true I&#39;m just thinking about in</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.130" end="01:22:54.500" style="s2">the context of these taboos like the</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.110" end="01:22:56.060" style="s2">taboo against infidelity and it makes</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.500" end="01:22:57.440" style="s2">people want to sort of step out or the</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.060" end="01:22:58.820" style="s2">fact that they&#39;re actually stuck in a</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.440" end="01:23:02.090" style="s2">monogamous relationship that they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.820" end="01:23:05.150" style="s2">want to be in is sort of an expression</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.090" end="01:23:06.680" style="s2">of their you know sex at dawn you know</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.150" end="01:23:08.210" style="s2">if you believe in that sort of theory</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.680" end="01:23:09.560" style="s2">about people wanting to have more one</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.210" end="01:23:11.420" style="s2">sexual partner so if you&#39;re totally</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.560" end="01:23:13.100" style="s2">limited by that then of course you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.420" end="01:23:15.470" style="s2">gonna feel an urge to do that and on the</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.100" end="01:23:17.270" style="s2">other end if you have a little bit more</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.470" end="01:23:18.770" style="s2">of a sexually liberal perspective and</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.270" end="01:23:20.480" style="s2">you&#39;ve had multiple partners then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.770" end="01:23:22.700" style="s2">not necessarily thinking about that I</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.480" end="01:23:25.430" style="s2">guess do Democrats have fantasies of</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.700" end="01:23:28.220" style="s2">being they do of being in a traditional</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.430" end="01:23:29.600" style="s2">relationship girls girls clothes horizon</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.220" end="01:23:31.070" style="s2">masturbate of like having a strong</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.600" end="01:23:32.960" style="s2">father figure tell them what to do and</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.070" end="01:23:37.910" style="s2">like put them in the kitchen and put an</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.960" end="01:23:41.030" style="s2">apron on them but I asked to figure out</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.910" end="01:23:43.580" style="s2">whether that&#39;s indeed the case that is</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.030" end="01:23:44.630" style="s2">really funny yes funny stuff okay I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.580" end="01:23:46.850" style="s2">gonna have to I&#39;m gonna have to dig</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.630" end="01:23:47.989" style="s2">deeper into this idea because I&#39;m not as</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.850" end="01:23:50.510" style="s2">I&#39;m talking about a little bit more I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.989" end="01:23:52.250" style="s2">not so I&#39;m not so sure that the social</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.510" end="01:23:54.800" style="s2">constructs are shaping our biology but</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.250" end="01:23:58.430" style="s2">rather like some of us have our biology</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.800" end="01:24:00.110" style="s2">expressed and some of us don&#39;t and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.430" end="01:24:01.940" style="s2">like where you can express it or not</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.110" end="01:24:03.410" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be where your where your</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.940" end="01:24:04.969" style="s2">urges and where your fantasies are I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.410" end="01:24:07.160" style="s2">just totally thinking out loud and sort</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.969" end="01:24:08.780" style="s2">of babbling at this play alright let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.160" end="01:24:10.849" style="s2">move on let&#39;s move on down the list</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.780" end="01:24:12.619" style="s2">one of the notions that I really really</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.849" end="01:24:15.380" style="s2">appreciated was the difference between</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.619" end="01:24:16.849" style="s2">sexuality and flexibility so could you</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.380" end="01:24:19.159" style="s2">talk about that and set that up because</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.849" end="01:24:22.010" style="s2">this is going to trigger a lot of people</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.159" end="01:24:23.750" style="s2">that listen to my podcast the difference</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.010" end="01:24:25.849" style="s2">between what your sexual orientation is</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.750" end="01:24:27.409" style="s2">and your proclivity to flexibility and</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.849" end="01:24:29.599" style="s2">what they are and the difference is in</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.409" end="01:24:30.800" style="s2">how one person may or have you know</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.599" end="01:24:34.760" style="s2">different you how we have different</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.800" end="01:24:36.619" style="s2">levels across across the spectrum so the</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.760" end="01:24:39.440" style="s2">way I define sexual orientation is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.619" end="01:24:41.389" style="s2">your orientation to partners of a</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.440" end="01:24:42.980" style="s2">certain gender and you can be</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.389" end="01:24:45.710" style="s2">heterosexual homosexual bisexual</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.980" end="01:24:48.340" style="s2">pansexual you know however it is that</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.710" end="01:24:50.960" style="s2">you want to define your orientation</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.340" end="01:24:52.760" style="s2">sexual flexibility on the other hand is</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.960" end="01:24:56.719" style="s2">sort of your your general willingness to</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.760" end="01:24:58.489" style="s2">deviate from what it is that you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.719" end="01:25:00.409" style="s2">told you should do when it comes to sex</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.489" end="01:25:02.480" style="s2">and your willingness to just you know</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.409" end="01:25:05.210" style="s2">try new things and experiment sexually</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.480" end="01:25:07.159" style="s2">so some people are high on section</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.210" end="01:25:09.079" style="s2">flexibility some people are low for the</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.159" end="01:25:10.610" style="s2">people who are high on flexibility they</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.079" end="01:25:13.039" style="s2">might actually even deviate from their</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.610" end="01:25:14.809" style="s2">sexual orientation right so if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.039" end="01:25:16.880" style="s2">somebody who is heterosexually oriented</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.809" end="01:25:18.650" style="s2">but you&#39;re very flexible of the right</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.880" end="01:25:20.690" style="s2">kind of circumstances arises you might</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.650" end="01:25:23.239" style="s2">have a same-sex experience even though</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.690" end="01:25:25.940" style="s2">that&#39;s not what your orientation is is</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.239" end="01:25:27.289" style="s2">gearing you toward so I see these as two</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.940" end="01:25:29.239" style="s2">very different things and it&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.289" end="01:25:31.610" style="s2">the reason why I think some people just</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.239" end="01:25:32.869" style="s2">have much more varied sexual experiences</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.610" end="01:25:34.880" style="s2">of the course of their life span is</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.869" end="01:25:37.789" style="s2">because they&#39;re just high on this sexual</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.880" end="01:25:40.460" style="s2">flexibility factor you know okay so</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.789" end="01:25:43.099" style="s2">let&#39;s define sexual orientation there</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.460" end="01:25:46.820" style="s2">for a second is there is there a</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.099" end="01:25:48.710" style="s2">difference between your ability to love</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.820" end="01:25:51.170" style="s2">somebody and your ability to have sex</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.710" end="01:25:53.300" style="s2">with them is that is there a difference</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.170" end="01:25:56.750" style="s2">there in your in orientation like how</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.300" end="01:25:58.070" style="s2">what how do you see that yeah so there</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.750" end="01:25:59.840" style="s2">are some researchers who make a</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.070" end="01:26:00.800" style="s2">distinction between your sexual</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.840" end="01:26:03.889" style="s2">attractions and your romantic</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.800" end="01:26:05.420" style="s2">attractions for most people those tend</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.889" end="01:26:06.679" style="s2">to overlap you know the people that you</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.420" end="01:26:09.139" style="s2">have sex about tend to be the people</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.679" end="01:26:10.760" style="s2">that you fall in love with there are</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.139" end="01:26:14.500" style="s2">some people where there might be a bit</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.760" end="01:26:17.329" style="s2">of a discrepancy you know for example I</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.500" end="01:26:19.429" style="s2">you know talked to some men who are</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.329" end="01:26:20.929" style="s2">primarily you know romantically</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.429" end="01:26:22.159" style="s2">attracted to women but they&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.929" end="01:26:26.599" style="s2">sexually attracted to men</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.159" end="01:26:28.159" style="s2">right so those things can overlap or or</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.599" end="01:26:31.669" style="s2">sometimes they can be totally different</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.159" end="01:26:32.179" style="s2">but for most part they go together they</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.669" end="01:26:34.459" style="s2">go together</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.179" end="01:26:37.280" style="s2">okay so sexual orientation is like who</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.459" end="01:26:40.789" style="s2">you who you desire to fall in love with</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.280" end="01:26:42.469" style="s2">and have sex with yes usually okay okay</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.789" end="01:26:45.139" style="s2">and you&#39;re saying there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.469" end="01:26:48.349" style="s2">separate you use the term dial in the</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.139" end="01:26:51.860" style="s2">book on flexibility which means you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.349" end="01:26:54.499" style="s2">just open to it&#39;s not necessarily gender</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.860" end="01:26:56.239" style="s2">specific experiences but open to just</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.499" end="01:26:57.679" style="s2">new kinds of experiences in general</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.239" end="01:27:00.679" style="s2">right and you can have your sexual needs</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.679" end="01:27:06.349" style="s2">met in a wider variety of ways as sort</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.679" end="01:27:09.050" style="s2">of what it is and we&#39;re we&#39;re okay so</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.349" end="01:27:11.510" style="s2">like you we I think we the research</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.050" end="01:27:13.999" style="s2">shows very clearly that like women are</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.510" end="01:27:16.340" style="s2">higher in levels of agreeableness and</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.999" end="01:27:18.110" style="s2">like neuroticism and men are and I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.340" end="01:27:19.189" style="s2">remember the other one the men&#39;s side</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.110" end="01:27:21.469" style="s2">but I can definitely remember them</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.189" end="01:27:23.900" style="s2">inside but my point is is that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.469" end="01:27:26.059" style="s2">there we have difference and in those</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.900" end="01:27:28.269" style="s2">gender related differences is there a</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.059" end="01:27:31.999" style="s2">gender related difference in in one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.269" end="01:27:33.709" style="s2">flexibility so we often talk about you</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.999" end="01:27:35.209" style="s2">know women being a bit more flexible</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.709" end="01:27:39.050" style="s2">when it comes to the gender of their</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.209" end="01:27:40.639" style="s2">partner and you know there is some</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.050" end="01:27:42.949" style="s2">research to back that up I see it in my</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.639" end="01:27:44.809" style="s2">own data where for example if you hear</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.949" end="01:27:48.169" style="s2">people who identify as exclusively</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.809" end="01:27:51.380" style="s2">heterosexual it&#39;s more than 50% of the</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.169" end="01:27:53.119" style="s2">women and about 1/4 of the men who say</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.380" end="01:27:55.130" style="s2">that they&#39;ve had a same-sex fantasy so</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.119" end="01:27:57.820" style="s2">so women are a bit more flexible with</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.130" end="01:28:00.380" style="s2">regard to the gender of their partner</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.820" end="01:28:02.090" style="s2">there&#39;s also some data to suggest that</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.380" end="01:28:04.219" style="s2">women are more flexible in other ways to</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.090" end="01:28:06.199" style="s2">wear just over the course of their</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.219" end="01:28:09.050" style="s2">lifespan their sexual behaviors are a</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.199" end="01:28:10.570" style="s2">little bit more variable but then men&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.050" end="01:28:13.880" style="s2">are they&#39;re more subject to</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.570" end="01:28:17.959" style="s2">socio-cultural influences than men&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.880" end="01:28:20.059" style="s2">you know trends sorry what trends yeah</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.959" end="01:28:21.409" style="s2">so you know the data would suggest that</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.059" end="01:28:24.169" style="s2">women are a little bit more flexible</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.409" end="01:28:26.150" style="s2">than men but it&#39;s not you know anybody</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.169" end="01:28:27.440" style="s2">of any gender could could be sexually</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.150" end="01:28:29.120" style="s2">flexible</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.440" end="01:28:30.949" style="s2">right so yeah so okay so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.120" end="01:28:33.290" style="s2">independent so guys what you&#39;re hearing</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.949" end="01:28:35.060" style="s2">now is that women are more open to</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.290" end="01:28:37.760" style="s2">same-sex experiences and potentially</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.060" end="01:28:40.540" style="s2">more open to a wider array of sexual</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.760" end="01:28:42.800" style="s2">experiences who&#39;s not safe to say yeah</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.540" end="01:28:45.800" style="s2">yeah and I think I think that I think</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.800" end="01:28:49.340" style="s2">guys are taught that women are are</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.800" end="01:28:52.510" style="s2">chased and women don&#39;t have the same sex</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.340" end="01:28:54.710" style="s2">drive and don&#39;t have the same variety of</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.510" end="01:28:56.840" style="s2">sexual fantasies and are less</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.710" end="01:28:59.630" style="s2">open-minded but actually the truth is is</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.840" end="01:29:01.160" style="s2">probably the opposite huh yeah what I</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.630" end="01:29:03.199" style="s2">see in my data is that women&#39;s fantasies</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.160" end="01:29:04.460" style="s2">are far more buried and diverse than</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.199" end="01:29:07.940" style="s2">most people have given them credit for</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.460" end="01:29:09.770" style="s2">you know most women in my sample I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.940" end="01:29:11.989" style="s2">reported group sex fantasies BDSM</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.770" end="01:29:14.420" style="s2">fantasies fantasies about sex in public</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.989" end="01:29:18.110" style="s2">and just trying new and different and</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.420" end="01:29:20.030" style="s2">taboo activities yeah yeah I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.110" end="01:29:22.400" style="s2">definitely had that one I&#39;m gonna say my</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.030" end="01:29:24.890" style="s2">data that means my personal my personal</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.400" end="01:29:28.160" style="s2">data might my data definitely backs that</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.890" end="01:29:29.870" style="s2">up as well too but I just would like the</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.160" end="01:29:32.630" style="s2">young men especially that are listening</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.870" end="01:29:34.280" style="s2">to this - to help squash that</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.630" end="01:29:35.750" style="s2">eliminating belief that they have in</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.280" end="01:29:37.880" style="s2">their head which is that women aren&#39;t as</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.750" end="01:29:39.380" style="s2">sexual as men are because really the</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.880" end="01:29:42.110" style="s2">opposite I think is true they&#39;re as</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.380" end="01:29:44.120" style="s2">sexual or even more sexual and you know</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.110" end="01:29:47.180" style="s2">to not be as afraid and this is a great</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.120" end="01:29:49.400" style="s2">segue to not be as afraid to bring up</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.180" end="01:29:51.230" style="s2">your sexual fantasies or desires with</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.400" end="01:29:53.989" style="s2">your woman or women you&#39;re dating or</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.230" end="01:29:56.180" style="s2">whatever out of fear that you will be</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.989" end="01:29:57.860" style="s2">rejected because women are somehow less</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.180" end="01:30:00.110" style="s2">sexually open-minded or less sexually</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.860" end="01:30:02.600" style="s2">flexible or whatnot because I think I</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.110" end="01:30:04.520" style="s2">think that society sort of hammers or</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.600" end="01:30:07.550" style="s2">did at least hammer home this notion</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.520" end="01:30:10.280" style="s2">that women are chaste value comes from</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.550" end="01:30:13.810" style="s2">chastity and that they tend to not have</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.280" end="01:30:16.160" style="s2">this this just wide a fait of sexual</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.810" end="01:30:19.400" style="s2">choices that they would like to select</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.160" end="01:30:23.300" style="s2">from and so I that in turn leads to</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.400" end="01:30:26.270" style="s2">anxiety for men in expressing their own</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.300" end="01:30:28.850" style="s2">sexual fantasies and desires with their</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.270" end="01:30:30.710" style="s2">women and it also leads to an inability</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.850" end="01:30:32.900" style="s2">to come to like a real connection with</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.710" end="01:30:34.310" style="s2">the women because they would how could I</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.900" end="01:30:35.750" style="s2">ever bring that up she would never want</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.310" end="01:30:38.150" style="s2">to do that if I bring that up oh my god</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.750" end="01:30:40.730" style="s2">she&#39;s gonna hate me so this is a great</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.150" end="01:30:41.190" style="s2">segue later on in the book you do talk</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.730" end="01:30:43.620" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.190" end="01:30:45.390" style="s2">like how to make this stuff happen and</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.620" end="01:30:47.100" style="s2">this is a great way to sort of wrap up</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.390" end="01:30:50.550" style="s2">our conversation I think here which is</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.100" end="01:30:52.050" style="s2">alright you&#39;ve you you general have come</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.550" end="01:30:53.580" style="s2">to the conclusion that you have sexual</p>

<p begin="01:31:17.610" end="01:31:23.820" style="s2">them how do we how do we bridge this</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.030" end="01:31:25.380" style="s2">chasm the socially constructed sexual</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.820" end="01:31:27.570" style="s2">chasm between the between the genders</p>

<p begin="01:31:39.239" end="01:31:42.810" style="s2">of them for expressing this type of</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.830" end="01:31:44.430" style="s2">fantasy or if the other partners</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.810" end="01:31:46.199" style="s2">insecurities and their inability to</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.430" end="01:31:47.190" style="s2">provide the sexual fantasy where all</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.199" end="01:31:49.190" style="s2">these things are gonna lead to a</p>

<p begin="01:32:12.000" end="01:32:17.610" style="s2">my data was that men more so than women</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.910" end="01:32:19.800" style="s2">felt shame and guilt and embarrassment</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.610" end="01:32:21.360" style="s2">about their sexual fantasies so so</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.800" end="01:32:23.190" style="s2">there&#39;s a gendered elements in sexual</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.360" end="01:32:25.140" style="s2">fantasies such that men actually feel</p>

<p begin="01:33:32.650" end="01:33:36.790" style="s2">good starting point for just coming to</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.930" end="01:33:38.230" style="s2">some level of self-acceptance and I</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.790" end="01:33:40.000" style="s2">think if you want to get to the point</p>

<p begin="01:34:36.580" end="01:34:41.110" style="s2">to become truly vulnerable in order to</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.710" end="01:34:42.280" style="s2">get what you need so I think we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.110" end="01:34:44.620" style="s2">to that point so you need to be</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.280" end="01:34:45.850" style="s2">vulnerable and then we&#39;re and then what</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.620" end="01:34:47.920" style="s2">are we gonna do first we need to be</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.850" end="01:34:49.750" style="s2">strong and then then we need to be</p>
<p begin="01:34:47.920" end="01:34:50.980" style="s2">vulnerable and then and then what and</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.750" end="01:34:53.580" style="s2">then you need to be good at talking</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.980" end="01:34:56.230" style="s2">about sex right you have to establish</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.580" end="01:34:58.690" style="s2">some kind of sexual communication with</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.230" end="01:35:00.940" style="s2">your partner and a lot of people just</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.690" end="01:35:03.370" style="s2">you know they start having sex without</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.940" end="01:35:05.610" style="s2">really establishing any kind of</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.370" end="01:35:07.260" style="s2">communication around it and so</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.610" end="01:35:08.730" style="s2">that&#39;s part of the reason why I think a</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.260" end="01:35:10.680" style="s2">lot of people grow bored with their</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.730" end="01:35:11.910" style="s2">sexual routines because they find</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.680" end="01:35:14.100" style="s2">themselves just having a lot of mediocre</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.910" end="01:35:16.170" style="s2">sex and it&#39;s in part because they aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.100" end="01:35:18.540" style="s2">talking about it and then as a result</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.170" end="01:35:20.280" style="s2">they&#39;re never mixing it up and in doing</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.540" end="01:35:22.770" style="s2">what it is that that everybody would</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.280" end="01:35:24.720" style="s2">would rather be doing instead so there</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.770" end="01:35:26.490" style="s2">are ways that you can start establishing</p>
<p begin="01:35:24.720" end="01:35:28.620" style="s2">a norm of sexual communication it could</p>
<p begin="01:35:26.490" end="01:35:30.060" style="s2">be you know maybe you play some sexy</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.620" end="01:35:30.600" style="s2">games with your partner could be that</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.060" end="01:35:32.280" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.600" end="01:35:33.750" style="s2">truth or dare or would you rather you</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.280" end="01:35:35.760" style="s2">know there all kinds of ways that you</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.750" end="01:35:37.410" style="s2">can just sort of open the door to having</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.760" end="01:35:38.850" style="s2">those conversations about sex and the</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.410" end="01:35:40.920" style="s2">more that you get practiced with that</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.850" end="01:35:44.750" style="s2">the easier it will become later to start</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.920" end="01:35:44.750" style="s2">sharing your sexual fantasies okay</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.180" end="01:35:51.750" style="s2">so let&#39;s let&#39;s just be I&#39;m just dumb</p>

<p begin="01:35:57.840" end="01:36:02.100" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s hard it&#39;s hard right I mean</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.610" end="01:36:04.080" style="s2">we&#39;re joking but like it&#39;s this is cool</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.100" end="01:36:06.930" style="s2">and there&#39;s a there&#39;s a real risk-taking</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.080" end="01:36:10.170" style="s2">element to this right so like what what</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.930" end="01:36:13.040" style="s2">is your advice to somebody who is afraid</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.170" end="01:36:15.810" style="s2">to tell their girlfriend that they wanna</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.040" end="01:36:17.700" style="s2">nurse on her breasts like a you know</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.810" end="01:36:19.290" style="s2">infant or something to get a rouse like</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.700" end="01:36:22.890" style="s2">you know that doesn&#39;t seem too crazy to</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.290" end="01:36:25.590" style="s2">me so like how do you go about like a</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.890" end="01:36:27.060" style="s2">man it&#39;s risky right it is and and I</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.590" end="01:36:28.980" style="s2">think you need to start by first picking</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.060" end="01:36:30.600" style="s2">the right time and place to have this</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.980" end="01:36:33.390" style="s2">conversation you know you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.600" end="01:36:34.470" style="s2">do it out at a restaurant or you know in</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.390" end="01:36:36.720" style="s2">other settings where people might</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.470" end="01:36:38.730" style="s2">overhear and where you or your partner</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.720" end="01:36:40.440" style="s2">might be concerned about that so pick</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.730" end="01:36:41.910" style="s2">the right setting and then when you want</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.440" end="01:36:44.130" style="s2">to start talking about your fantasies</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.910" end="01:36:46.020" style="s2">try and do it in a state and your</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.130" end="01:36:48.510" style="s2">partner is already sexually aroused so</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.020" end="01:36:50.370" style="s2">maybe when you&#39;re not in you know in the</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.510" end="01:36:52.560" style="s2">midst of sexual activity or maybe you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:36:50.370" end="01:36:55.200" style="s2">watching porn together or an erotic</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.560" end="01:36:56.370" style="s2">movie something that happens when people</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.200" end="01:36:57.780" style="s2">are in a heightened state of sexual</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.370" end="01:37:00.300" style="s2">arousal is that their disgust response</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.780" end="01:37:01.950" style="s2">lessens and so your partner might be</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.300" end="01:37:03.150" style="s2">more receptive to talking about their</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.950" end="01:37:05.790" style="s2">fantasies or hearing about your</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.150" end="01:37:09.600" style="s2">fantasies if they&#39;re already aroused for</p>
<p begin="01:37:05.790" end="01:37:12.840" style="s2">that reason all right I I was I go ahead</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.600" end="01:37:14.430" style="s2">oh and then I thing when it comes to</p>

<p begin="01:37:20.680" end="01:37:24.520" style="s2">partner is likely to be into and then</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.380" end="01:37:26.890" style="s2">think of this as sort of like a</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.520" end="01:37:29.470" style="s2">progressive thing where you can build up</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.890" end="01:37:31.660" style="s2">over time to your more intense fantasies</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.470" end="01:37:32.980" style="s2">right that&#39;s that&#39;s exactly right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.660" end="01:37:35.410" style="s2">that in fact that&#39;s what I was gonna say</p>

<p begin="01:37:51.280" end="01:37:54.610" style="s2">out there you know and I&#39;ve done a lot</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.990" end="01:37:56.470" style="s2">of research in that not only in my</p>
<p begin="01:37:54.610" end="01:37:58.180" style="s2">practice but like I&#39;m so inquisitive</p>
<p begin="01:37:56.470" end="01:38:00.220" style="s2">with the women that I&#39;ve been with I ask</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.180" end="01:38:01.570" style="s2">them all these same questions to get</p>
<p begin="01:38:00.220" end="01:38:04.090" style="s2">their feedback about the men that</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.570" end="01:38:06.160" style="s2">they&#39;ve been with and like I think it</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.090" end="01:38:08.140" style="s2">would be not a crazy thing for me to say</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.160" end="01:38:09.850" style="s2">that like a lot of men might be afraid</p>
<p begin="01:38:08.140" end="01:38:11.680" style="s2">to even acknowledge that they want to</p>
<p begin="01:38:09.850" end="01:38:14.350" style="s2">like suck on their girlfriend&#39;s breasts</p>
<p begin="01:38:11.680" end="01:38:16.420" style="s2">it&#39;s like you gotta just start small so</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.350" end="01:38:18.190" style="s2">guys like analyze where you are or in</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.420" end="01:38:20.800" style="s2">women I mean I just say guys generally</p>

<p begin="01:38:20.800" end="01:38:25.570" style="s2">practice and then like try to go like</p>
<p begin="01:38:23.680" end="01:38:28.090" style="s2">one or two degrees in the direction that</p>
<p begin="01:38:25.570" end="01:38:30.370" style="s2">you want to go don&#39;t just bring the</p>
<p begin="01:38:28.090" end="01:38:31.810" style="s2">chains immediately right you know let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.370" end="01:38:33.460" style="s2">start with just like a little smack on</p>
<p begin="01:38:31.810" end="01:38:36.160" style="s2">the butt or something or you know</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.460" end="01:38:37.630" style="s2">holding her down on her shoulders or you</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.160" end="01:38:39.880" style="s2">know just little little things where you</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.630" end="01:38:41.620" style="s2">can start a progression and assuming you</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.880" end="01:38:43.930" style="s2">know you&#39;re in this in a relationship</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.620" end="01:38:45.970" style="s2">for an extended period of time and you</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.930" end="01:38:47.680" style="s2">want to work up to this stuff you know</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.970" end="01:38:50.380" style="s2">you can build towards it and as long as</p>
<p begin="01:38:47.680" end="01:38:51.850" style="s2">I&#39;ve you know with any human endeavor as</p>
<p begin="01:38:50.380" end="01:38:53.890" style="s2">long as you&#39;re making progress in the</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.850" end="01:38:55.540" style="s2">direction that you want to go generally</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.890" end="01:38:57.250" style="s2">that&#39;s fulfilling right and like</p>
<p begin="01:38:55.540" end="01:38:59.080" style="s2">achieving the goal isn&#39;t always as</p>
<p begin="01:38:57.250" end="01:39:01.570" style="s2">fulfilling as beginning the process and</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.080" end="01:39:02.620" style="s2">I found that with all kinds of stuff you</p>
<p begin="01:39:01.570" end="01:39:04.210" style="s2">know you think you&#39;re gonna get to the</p>
<p begin="01:39:02.620" end="01:39:05.590" style="s2">end goal and just be like overwhelmed</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.210" end="01:39:07.780" style="s2">with the sense of amazement and</p>
<p begin="01:39:05.590" end="01:39:09.910" style="s2">accomplishment but really going from 9</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.780" end="01:39:11.890" style="s2">to 10 is like just as good as going from</p>
<p begin="01:39:09.910" end="01:39:13.600" style="s2">from 1 to 2 but going from 0 to 1 is</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.890" end="01:39:16.030" style="s2">probably the most exhilarating part of</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.600" end="01:39:18.820" style="s2">the whole thing so just start slow guys</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.030" end="01:39:20.590" style="s2">and you have to there&#39;s not a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.820" end="01:39:23.590" style="s2">guys out there talking to guys who are</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.590" end="01:39:25.180" style="s2">saying communication is key but like I</p>
<p begin="01:39:23.590" end="01:39:27.190" style="s2">can tell you you have to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:39:25.180" end="01:39:28.900" style="s2">communicate and that comes from a sense</p>
<p begin="01:39:27.190" end="01:39:29.640" style="s2">of vulnerability that comes from a sense</p>
<p begin="01:39:28.900" end="01:39:31.350" style="s2">of strength</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.640" end="01:39:33.360" style="s2">so in order to be a good communicator</p>
<p begin="01:39:31.350" end="01:39:35.040" style="s2">you also have to be strong you have to</p>
<p begin="01:39:33.360" end="01:39:36.510" style="s2">have developed your mindset you have to</p>
<p begin="01:39:35.040" end="01:39:38.460" style="s2">have developed your inner strength and</p>
<p begin="01:39:36.510" end="01:39:40.020" style="s2">you have to develop your sense that you</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.460" end="01:39:43.590" style="s2">you have to be able to take small risks</p>
<p begin="01:39:40.020" end="01:39:46.080" style="s2">so we&#39;ve we&#39;ve covered trying to get rid</p>
<p begin="01:39:43.590" end="01:39:47.280" style="s2">of the shame we&#39;ve covered you have to</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.080" end="01:39:50.250" style="s2">take a little bit of risk we&#39;ve covered</p>
<p begin="01:39:47.280" end="01:39:51.960" style="s2">taking little progressive steps is there</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.250" end="01:39:54.360" style="s2">is there anything else did you talk</p>
<p begin="01:39:51.960" end="01:39:56.940" style="s2">about in the book like what happens when</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.360" end="01:39:59.070" style="s2">the moment comes with all 50 women in</p>

<p begin="01:40:34.350" end="01:40:38.190" style="s2">plan ahead but also realize that you</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.210" end="01:40:40.110" style="s2">can&#39;t anticipate everything things might</p>
<p begin="01:40:38.190" end="01:40:42.180" style="s2">not go according to plan and if it</p>
<p begin="01:40:40.110" end="01:40:43.740" style="s2">doesn&#39;t that&#39;s okay it doesn&#39;t mean like</p>

<p begin="01:40:50.190" end="01:40:54.210" style="s2">try next time to do something</p>
<p begin="01:40:51.930" end="01:40:55.950" style="s2">differently so be prepared for the</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.210" end="01:40:57.630" style="s2">unexpected and and you have to keep</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.950" end="01:40:59.010" style="s2">communicating the whole time and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:57.630" end="01:41:01.740" style="s2">important to do that debriefing</p>
<p begin="01:40:59.010" end="01:41:03.390" style="s2">afterwards as well so you can be even</p>
<p begin="01:41:01.740" end="01:41:06.660" style="s2">better prepared for the time after that</p>
<p begin="01:41:03.390" end="01:41:09.510" style="s2">yes definitely the debrief is very</p>
<p begin="01:41:06.660" end="01:41:11.220" style="s2">important in my personal experience I</p>
<p begin="01:41:09.510" end="01:41:14.370" style="s2">know that that is where the progress</p>
<p begin="01:41:11.220" end="01:41:15.840" style="s2">comes you do the thing you plan the</p>
<p begin="01:41:14.370" end="01:41:17.100" style="s2">thing you do the thing and afterwards</p>
<p begin="01:41:15.840" end="01:41:18.150" style="s2">you got it you really have to break it</p>
<p begin="01:41:17.100" end="01:41:19.710" style="s2">down you have to be like well how did</p>
<p begin="01:41:18.150" end="01:41:21.030" style="s2">you feel about that could I have done</p>
<p begin="01:41:19.710" end="01:41:22.290" style="s2">something different could you do</p>
<p begin="01:41:21.030" end="01:41:24.630" style="s2">something different how can we enhance</p>
<p begin="01:41:22.290" end="01:41:26.700" style="s2">this do we even do it again the debrief</p>
<p begin="01:41:24.630" end="01:41:29.460" style="s2">is an essential part of an evolution I</p>
<p begin="01:41:26.700" end="01:41:31.320" style="s2">wanted to bring up one slight variation</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.460" end="01:41:32.430" style="s2">on this which is you know I&#39;ve dated a</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.320" end="01:41:33.990" style="s2">bunch of girls that tell me that</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.430" end="01:41:35.460" style="s2">gangbangs like their number one fantasy</p>
<p begin="01:41:33.990" end="01:41:37.260" style="s2">and they masturbate to like the whole</p>
<p begin="01:41:35.460" end="01:41:39.420" style="s2">soccer team taking them in the shower</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.260" end="01:41:41.400" style="s2">and all that stuff but they don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:41:39.420" end="01:41:42.630" style="s2">want that to happen they don&#39;t want ten</p>
<p begin="01:41:41.400" end="01:41:44.190" style="s2">dudes them coming</p>
<p begin="01:41:42.630" end="01:41:46.409" style="s2">all over them right but they want to</p>
<p begin="01:41:44.190" end="01:41:50.040" style="s2">fantasize about it so I think that there</p>
<p begin="01:41:46.409" end="01:41:51.570" style="s2">are also there&#39;s progress to be made</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.040" end="01:41:54.389" style="s2">where you can just talk about your</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.570" end="01:41:57.870" style="s2">fantasies and sort of fantasize together</p>
<p begin="01:41:54.389" end="01:42:00.449" style="s2">right and like you can have an enhanced</p>
<p begin="01:41:57.870" end="01:42:02.100" style="s2">sexual experience just being in the</p>
<p begin="01:42:00.449" end="01:42:04.320" style="s2">moment together and sharing those</p>
<p begin="01:42:02.100" end="01:42:07.350" style="s2">fantasies together and even just acting</p>
<p begin="01:42:04.320" end="01:42:09.870" style="s2">acting like it&#39;s happening can be a very</p>
<p begin="01:42:07.350" end="01:42:11.520" style="s2">fulfilling way of enhancing your sex</p>
<p begin="01:42:09.870" end="01:42:13.590" style="s2">life and it doesn&#39;t always you know</p>
<p begin="01:42:11.520" end="01:42:16.469" style="s2">their fantasies for a reason in some</p>
<p begin="01:42:13.590" end="01:42:18.000" style="s2">cases right you don&#39;t have to act them</p>
<p begin="01:42:16.469" end="01:42:20.340" style="s2">out and if you&#39;re not acting them out</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.000" end="01:42:22.679" style="s2">you&#39;re not failing right what like</p>
<p begin="01:42:20.340" end="01:42:25.230" style="s2">incorporate a new layer of shame for</p>
<p begin="01:42:22.679" end="01:42:28.080" style="s2">guys like oh man I only have 48 at my</p>
<p begin="01:42:25.230" end="01:42:29.699" style="s2">last one I feel a sense of shame come on</p>
<p begin="01:42:28.080" end="01:42:32.400" style="s2">Jack standards are too high here but no</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.699" end="01:42:33.900" style="s2">but seriously just even talking about</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.400" end="01:42:35.969" style="s2">your fantasies with your partner can</p>
<p begin="01:42:33.900" end="01:42:38.989" style="s2">really lead to an enhance sexual</p>
<p begin="01:42:35.969" end="01:42:41.730" style="s2">experience and so don&#39;t be afraid don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:42:38.989" end="01:42:44.190" style="s2">don&#39;t think that just because she has a</p>
<p begin="01:42:41.730" end="01:42:46.560" style="s2">fantasy she really wants to do it like</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.190" end="01:42:49.830" style="s2">we&#39;ve delineated between a fantasy and a</p>
<p begin="01:42:46.560" end="01:42:51.600" style="s2">desire and even an urge and a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:42:49.830" end="01:42:53.940" style="s2">times fantasies are just that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:42:51.600" end="01:42:56.489" style="s2">just fantasies and that&#39;s and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:53.940" end="01:42:57.780" style="s2">okay but it&#39;s fun to talk about them</p>
<p begin="01:42:56.489" end="01:42:59.280" style="s2">with somebody that you trust and that</p>
<p begin="01:42:57.780" end="01:43:01.469" style="s2">you love and that you&#39;re having having</p>
<p begin="01:42:59.280" end="01:43:03.330" style="s2">great sex with yeah no that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:43:01.469" end="01:43:05.219" style="s2">that I often tell people when I teach my</p>
<p begin="01:43:03.330" end="01:43:06.750" style="s2">workshops and so forth is it fantasies</p>
<p begin="01:43:05.219" end="01:43:09.120" style="s2">in and of themselves can just be a great</p>
<p begin="01:43:06.750" end="01:43:12.030" style="s2">form of dirty talk and for some people</p>
<p begin="01:43:09.120" end="01:43:13.860" style="s2">that&#39;s all the further it needs to go if</p>
<p begin="01:43:12.030" end="01:43:16.560" style="s2">you you need to think within your own</p>
<p begin="01:43:13.860" end="01:43:18.420" style="s2">moral values and and what&#39;s feasible and</p>
<p begin="01:43:16.560" end="01:43:20.820" style="s2">practical for you whether acting on it</p>
<p begin="01:43:18.420" end="01:43:22.080" style="s2">is the right move but just just starting</p>
<p begin="01:43:20.820" end="01:43:24.330" style="s2">with that form of dirty talk is</p>
<p begin="01:43:22.080" end="01:43:26.489" style="s2">sometimes enough for people yeah</p>
<p begin="01:43:24.330" end="01:43:29.460" style="s2">absolutely absolutely I agree with that</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.489" end="01:43:32.909" style="s2">so my one last question for you is what</p>
<p begin="01:43:29.460" end="01:43:34.710" style="s2">after doing this work after he was like</p>
<p begin="01:43:32.909" end="01:43:37.500" style="s2">4,000 people right you must have read</p>
<p begin="01:43:34.710" end="01:43:39.300" style="s2">you must have read just a ridiculous</p>
<p begin="01:43:37.500" end="01:43:40.860" style="s2">amount of sexual fantasies yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:43:39.300" end="01:43:42.300" style="s2">you&#39;ve learned a ton about people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:40.860" end="01:43:43.380" style="s2">sexuality and of course you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:43:42.300" end="01:43:44.940" style="s2">around the country talking to people</p>
<p begin="01:43:43.380" end="01:43:46.860" style="s2">you&#39;re engaging with people who engage</p>
<p begin="01:43:44.940" end="01:43:50.159" style="s2">with people about their sexuality you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:43:46.860" end="01:43:53.400" style="s2">learned a ton what are your hopes for</p>
<p begin="01:43:50.159" end="01:43:55.360" style="s2">our collective human sexuality like what</p>
<p begin="01:43:53.400" end="01:43:58.449" style="s2">what do you wish</p>
<p begin="01:43:55.360" end="01:44:00.699" style="s2">would change would grow would evolve you</p>
<p begin="01:43:58.449" end="01:44:03.099" style="s2">know five years from now how would you</p>
<p begin="01:44:00.699" end="01:44:05.139" style="s2">like to see our national dialogues be</p>
<p begin="01:44:03.099" end="01:44:08.110" style="s2">different our practices be different</p>
<p begin="01:44:05.139" end="01:44:10.719" style="s2">like if you could you know a wave a wand</p>
<p begin="01:44:08.110" end="01:44:14.559" style="s2">like what are your desires for us as</p>
<p begin="01:44:10.719" end="01:44:16.000" style="s2">Americans you know in humans in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:44:14.559" end="01:44:20.770" style="s2">our sexuality mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:44:16.000" end="01:44:22.949" style="s2">oh so many desires um what is that I</p>
<p begin="01:44:20.770" end="01:44:26.219" style="s2">wish we could move past this debate over</p>
<p begin="01:44:22.949" end="01:44:28.900" style="s2">abstinence only sex education right</p>
<p begin="01:44:26.219" end="01:44:31.270" style="s2">we see in the data that it just doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:44:28.900" end="01:44:33.550" style="s2">work when the only skill you teach</p>
<p begin="01:44:31.270" end="01:44:34.150" style="s2">people is just say no to sex it don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="01:44:33.550" end="01:44:35.860" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:44:34.150" end="01:44:37.449" style="s2">we see that in states where they have</p>
<p begin="01:44:35.860" end="01:44:39.730" style="s2">more abstinence programs they have</p>
<p begin="01:44:37.449" end="01:44:42.429" style="s2">higher rates of teen pregnancy more teen</p>
<p begin="01:44:39.730" end="01:44:43.860" style="s2">sti&#39;s more teen abortions and so if you</p>
<p begin="01:44:42.429" end="01:44:46.059" style="s2">want to reduce all of those things</p>
<p begin="01:44:43.860" end="01:44:48.460" style="s2">comprehensive sex education can help</p>
<p begin="01:44:46.059" end="01:44:50.290" style="s2">with that and we know that there are</p>
<p begin="01:44:48.460" end="01:44:52.210" style="s2">models for this that work I&#39;ve taught a</p>
<p begin="01:44:50.290" end="01:44:53.920" style="s2">study abroad course in the Netherlands</p>
<p begin="01:44:52.210" end="01:44:55.960" style="s2">for the last two years where I&#39;ve gone</p>
<p begin="01:44:53.920" end="01:44:57.550" style="s2">and met with the people who have</p>
<p begin="01:44:55.960" end="01:45:00.489" style="s2">developed the curriculum that they use</p>
<p begin="01:44:57.550" end="01:45:02.409" style="s2">in Dutch schools and their program works</p>
<p begin="01:45:00.489" end="01:45:04.119" style="s2">you know they teach people actual sexual</p>
<p begin="01:45:02.409" end="01:45:06.699" style="s2">communication skills and they have the</p>
<p begin="01:45:04.119" end="01:45:08.469" style="s2">lowest rate of teen SDI&#39;s teen abortions</p>
<p begin="01:45:06.699" end="01:45:10.719" style="s2">teen pregnancies in the industrialized</p>
<p begin="01:45:08.469" end="01:45:13.210" style="s2">world you know so we need to start early</p>
<p begin="01:45:10.719" end="01:45:14.889" style="s2">on teaching people how to communicate</p>
<p begin="01:45:13.210" end="01:45:16.630" style="s2">about sex and that will make it a lot</p>
<p begin="01:45:14.889" end="01:45:18.520" style="s2">easier for people to communicate about</p>
<p begin="01:45:16.630" end="01:45:20.230" style="s2">their fantasies later on and I think to</p>
<p begin="01:45:18.520" end="01:45:22.389" style="s2">establish happier and healthier</p>
<p begin="01:45:20.230" end="01:45:24.670" style="s2">relationships so I think you know my</p>
<p begin="01:45:22.389" end="01:45:26.860" style="s2">goal is we want to start with the way we</p>
<p begin="01:45:24.670" end="01:45:28.929" style="s2">approach sex education early on and that</p>
<p begin="01:45:26.860" end="01:45:30.760" style="s2">could eliminate so many of the problems</p>
<p begin="01:45:28.929" end="01:45:33.219" style="s2">that that we have in our sex lives and</p>
<p begin="01:45:30.760" end="01:45:34.510" style="s2">relationships related to that you know</p>
<p begin="01:45:33.219" end="01:45:36.130" style="s2">parents also need to get better at</p>
<p begin="01:45:34.510" end="01:45:37.840" style="s2">talking to their kids about sex you know</p>
