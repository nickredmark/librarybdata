<p begin="00:01:13.439" end="00:01:18.000" style="s2">develop civilization into what it is so</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.320" end="00:01:19.600" style="s2">much of what i described as social</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.000" end="00:01:20.960" style="s2">technologies and people might think of</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.600" end="00:01:23.680" style="s2">as social technologies</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.960" end="00:01:25.040" style="s2">might come under um the purview of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.680" end="00:01:28.960" style="s2">topic of religion</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.040" end="00:01:32.000" style="s2">right the term originates with a</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.960" end="00:01:35.920" style="s2">language from ancient rome right</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.000" end="00:01:36.720" style="s2">religio means meant this adherence to</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.920" end="00:01:39.200" style="s2">behavior</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.720" end="00:01:40.479" style="s2">adherence to proper forms adherence to</p>

<p begin="00:01:43.840" end="00:01:50.560" style="s2">um the concept of a secular state</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.240" end="00:01:52.320" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have made any sense at all to</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.560" end="00:01:54.960" style="s2">the ancient romans or the ancient</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.320" end="00:01:56.560" style="s2">egyptians or the ancient babylonians</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.960" end="00:01:58.240" style="s2">they all interacted with it quite</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.560" end="00:02:01.119" style="s2">differently however</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.240" end="00:02:02.320" style="s2">uh in sumerian city-states the origin</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.119" end="00:02:05.920" style="s2">their origin</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.320" end="00:02:09.280" style="s2">was of these countries held as</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.920" end="00:02:11.440" style="s2">basically you know ruled by priest kings</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.280" end="00:02:14.160" style="s2">or at times even god kings</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.440" end="00:02:15.680" style="s2">the official line on the pharaoh of</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.160" end="00:02:18.000" style="s2">egypt was that this was</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.680" end="00:02:19.360" style="s2">an embodiment of a divinity that he was</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.000" end="00:02:23.840" style="s2">a god</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.360" end="00:02:25.520" style="s2">not just a man appointed by gods</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.840" end="00:02:26.879" style="s2">so that brings us to the first function</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.520" end="00:02:29.680" style="s2">which i think is</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.879" end="00:02:31.239" style="s2">organized religion tends to cause this</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.680" end="00:02:34.480" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.239" end="00:02:37.360" style="s2">legitimization of power right</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.480" end="00:02:37.840" style="s2">uh it&#39;s very net it&#39;s very notable that</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.360" end="00:02:39.920" style="s2">almost</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.840" end="00:02:42.239" style="s2">every state has needed to evoke</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.920" end="00:02:44.720" style="s2">something mildly supernatural</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.239" end="00:02:46.160" style="s2">be it the chinese mandate of heaven be</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.720" end="00:02:49.200" style="s2">it again the egyptian</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.160" end="00:02:53.040" style="s2">uh premise that there is rule by god</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.200" end="00:02:55.120" style="s2">or gods and in the name of gods</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.040" end="00:02:57.040" style="s2">why is this need for supernatural</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.120" end="00:02:58.879" style="s2">legitimacy there</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.040" end="00:03:00.319" style="s2">uh people might object and say that</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.879" end="00:03:02.319" style="s2">modern states don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.319" end="00:03:04.239" style="s2">an appeal to supernatural legitimacy</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.319" end="00:03:05.840" style="s2">that all they appeal to is the will of</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.239" end="00:03:07.200" style="s2">the people as such</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.840" end="00:03:09.120" style="s2">but i want to note that you know the</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.200" end="00:03:11.680" style="s2">most famous example of this</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.120" end="00:03:12.159" style="s2">uh in the united states constitution has</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.680" end="00:03:15.200" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.159" end="00:03:17.200" style="s2">you know endowed by nato inalienable</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.200" end="00:03:19.040" style="s2">rights by their creator right that</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.200" end="00:03:21.840" style="s2">particular line</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.040" end="00:03:25.200" style="s2">reveals an appeal to supernatural</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.840" end="00:03:25.200" style="s2">supernatural principles</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.680" end="00:03:28.879" style="s2">the classic story about this is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.000" end="00:03:32.560" style="s2">this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.879" end="00:03:34.959" style="s2">comptian perspective of positivism</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.560" end="00:03:36.959" style="s2">right of this kind of view of well</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.959" end="00:03:38.159" style="s2">there&#39;s the social utility of religion</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.959" end="00:03:40.799" style="s2">there&#39;s the necessity for the</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.159" end="00:03:42.319" style="s2">establishment of morals and so on</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.799" end="00:03:46.159" style="s2">i think something much more subtle is</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.319" end="00:03:48.000" style="s2">going on i think that</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.159" end="00:03:50.879" style="s2">something to be considered a legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.000" end="00:03:54.319" style="s2">power it has to feel unstoppable</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.879" end="00:03:57.360" style="s2">so it&#39;s less about states need religion</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.319" end="00:03:58.239" style="s2">to regulate morality and they define</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.360" end="00:04:00.560" style="s2">themselves as</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.239" end="00:04:02.159" style="s2">in principle always moral i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.560" end="00:04:04.239" style="s2">more in a sense that</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.159" end="00:04:06.239" style="s2">this state this particular way of being</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.239" end="00:04:09.360" style="s2">this particular organization of power</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.239" end="00:04:10.560" style="s2">is natural and inevitable and</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.360" end="00:04:13.040" style="s2">unstoppable</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.560" end="00:04:15.840" style="s2">so again closer to the mandate of heaven</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.040" end="00:04:19.680" style="s2">conception</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.840" end="00:04:22.079" style="s2">the particular thing about</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.680" end="00:04:23.360" style="s2">the regulation also of interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.079" end="00:04:25.520" style="s2">morality</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.360" end="00:04:27.280" style="s2">it&#39;s less in the establishments of</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.520" end="00:04:28.080" style="s2">things that are right or things that are</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.280" end="00:04:30.639" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.080" end="00:04:32.800" style="s2">and more the establishment of commonly</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.639" end="00:04:36.000" style="s2">shared and recognized legible ways to</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.800" end="00:04:37.600" style="s2">deal with conflict or to deal with life</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.000" end="00:04:40.160" style="s2">if everyone is defining their own</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.600" end="00:04:41.520" style="s2">morality if everyone has their own basis</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.160" end="00:04:44.000" style="s2">and their intuition</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.520" end="00:04:46.080" style="s2">communicating moral judgments and facts</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.000" end="00:04:48.160" style="s2">becomes extremely difficult</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.080" end="00:04:50.560" style="s2">one of the barriers that is filled here</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.160" end="00:04:52.960" style="s2">is that depositing of this external</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.560" end="00:04:56.479" style="s2">arbitration this external thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.960" end="00:05:00.320" style="s2">that um absolves you of</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.479" end="00:05:02.639" style="s2">moral responsibility or of doubt</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.320" end="00:05:03.520" style="s2">that can regulate everyday interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.639" end="00:05:07.440" style="s2">interactions</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.520" end="00:05:09.440" style="s2">very well the interesting thing about</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.440" end="00:05:11.600" style="s2">making these interpersonal interactions</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.440" end="00:05:15.039" style="s2">legible by making there to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.600" end="00:05:18.080" style="s2">clear limits to what is and what is not</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.039" end="00:05:18.639" style="s2">uh reconstitution for moral wrongs think</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.080" end="00:05:20.800" style="s2">that us</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.639" end="00:05:22.720" style="s2">things that a state might not regulate</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.800" end="00:05:24.400" style="s2">is that it interests society towards a</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.720" end="00:05:26.960" style="s2">higher trust equilibrium</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.400" end="00:05:28.960" style="s2">all else equal instead of having very</p>

<p begin="00:05:36.800" end="00:05:40.479" style="s2">rather simple something that could be</p>

<p begin="00:05:40.479" end="00:05:44.240" style="s2">or can be done in front of many people</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.479" end="00:05:46.800" style="s2">that allow you to be forgiven</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.240" end="00:05:48.960" style="s2">and return into the fold or to be you</p>

<p begin="00:06:17.919" end="00:06:21.680" style="s2">which of course again much is the term</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.240" end="00:06:24.560" style="s2">outlaws means that</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.680" end="00:06:25.039" style="s2">you know killing you is not a crime</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.560" end="00:06:26.800" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.039" end="00:06:28.880" style="s2">so the concept of an outlaw is someone</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.800" end="00:06:31.520" style="s2">outside of the protection of the law</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.880" end="00:06:32.319" style="s2">in an interesting way declaring someone</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.520" end="00:06:35.680" style="s2">sacred</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.319" end="00:06:37.840" style="s2">made them therefore in you know very</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.680" end="00:06:39.120" style="s2">subject to a lot of danger a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.840" end="00:06:41.520" style="s2">violence</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.120" end="00:06:43.440" style="s2">uh that might seem so paradoxical for</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.520" end="00:06:45.520" style="s2">the conception of religion as basically</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.440" end="00:06:47.280" style="s2">being this thing that gives us morals</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.520" end="00:06:49.039" style="s2">but it&#39;s not at all paradoxical if we</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.280" end="00:06:51.520" style="s2">see it as a way to resolve</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.039" end="00:06:53.280" style="s2">basically procedural issues or to</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.520" end="00:06:55.440" style="s2">augment human intuitions</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.280" end="00:06:56.479" style="s2">of violence and forgiveness and</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.440" end="00:06:58.479" style="s2">cooperation</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.479" end="00:07:00.639" style="s2">and modify them right introduce new</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.479" end="00:07:02.880" style="s2">social tech</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.639" end="00:07:05.440" style="s2">the aztecs had something very similar to</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.880" end="00:07:07.440" style="s2">make someone a god what does this mean</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.440" end="00:07:09.280" style="s2">like in the aztec context that means</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.440" end="00:07:11.199" style="s2">that you would sacrifice them</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.280" end="00:07:13.120" style="s2">right you would tear their heart out on</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.199" end="00:07:13.919" style="s2">top of the temple of the moon or of the</p>

<p begin="00:07:13.919" end="00:07:17.440" style="s2">in front of everyone and the belief was</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.759" end="00:07:20.720" style="s2">that the person therefore ascends</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.440" end="00:07:22.160" style="s2">becomes part of godly nature but also</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.720" end="00:07:24.880" style="s2">this horrific violence</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.160" end="00:07:25.680" style="s2">is visited on them rene gerard&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.880" end="00:07:27.840" style="s2">thinking here</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.680" end="00:07:29.440" style="s2">is decently important he didn&#39;t cite the</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.840" end="00:07:31.440" style="s2">aztec example</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.440" end="00:07:32.960" style="s2">but he did cite ancient mediterranean</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.440" end="00:07:36.080" style="s2">human sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.960" end="00:07:38.960" style="s2">he had this thesis where the war</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.080" end="00:07:39.599" style="s2">of all becomes the war of all against</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.960" end="00:07:41.840" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.599" end="00:07:43.599" style="s2">so the hobsyan contract the habsian</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.840" end="00:07:46.000" style="s2">paradox where</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.599" end="00:07:47.680" style="s2">wall of war of all against all high</p>

<p begin="00:07:47.680" end="00:07:50.720" style="s2">understanding</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.800" end="00:07:52.800" style="s2">the hobbesian solution is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.720" end="00:07:56.080" style="s2">resolved through the social contract of</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.800" end="00:07:58.960" style="s2">the rule of one overall or the rule of</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.080" end="00:08:01.840" style="s2">the community council overall</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.960" end="00:08:03.039" style="s2">gerard would propose no it&#39;s rather the</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.840" end="00:08:06.400" style="s2">war of all against</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.039" end="00:08:07.919" style="s2">all becomes the war of all against one</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.400" end="00:08:10.160" style="s2">and this person is essentially</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.919" end="00:08:13.120" style="s2">arbitrarily chosen sacrificed</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.160" end="00:08:15.280" style="s2">and only later do they come to reflect</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.120" end="00:08:17.039" style="s2">on and deify the person that in the past</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.280" end="00:08:18.800" style="s2">was sacrificed</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.039" end="00:08:20.560" style="s2">i don&#39;t think this is quite the right</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.800" end="00:08:22.879" style="s2">account</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.560" end="00:08:24.479" style="s2">but gerard understands that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.879" end="00:08:26.479" style="s2">problem there&#39;s something interesting</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.479" end="00:08:28.560" style="s2">and unusual to explain</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.479" end="00:08:31.280" style="s2">about the transition from very local</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.560" end="00:08:33.360" style="s2">societies to societies that scale</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.280" end="00:08:35.279" style="s2">from what are at times relatively</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.360" end="00:08:37.519" style="s2">violent societies to societies that are</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.279" end="00:08:39.680" style="s2">perhaps internally non-violent but</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.519" end="00:08:42.080" style="s2">externally extremely violent</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.680" end="00:08:44.240" style="s2">i think it&#39;s not unfair to characterize</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.080" end="00:08:46.959" style="s2">bronze age societies as</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.240" end="00:08:48.320" style="s2">internally non-violent and externally</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.959" end="00:08:50.240" style="s2">extremely violent</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.320" end="00:08:52.000" style="s2">in fact i would characterize the modern</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.240" end="00:08:55.360" style="s2">nation state as being</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.000" end="00:08:55.920" style="s2">that but more so right so in world war</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.360" end="00:08:59.120" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.920" end="00:09:02.720" style="s2">you kill someone in you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.120" end="00:09:04.800" style="s2">a fit of rage be a jealousy envy</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.720" end="00:09:05.920" style="s2">you are tried people think you are a bad</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.800" end="00:09:08.560" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.920" end="00:09:10.480" style="s2">you fire artillery shells at other</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.560" end="00:09:11.839" style="s2">people at the front line not only are</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.480" end="00:09:14.800" style="s2">you not a bad person</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.839" end="00:09:15.680" style="s2">right firing artillery shells at people</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.800" end="00:09:17.200" style="s2">in the trenches</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.680" end="00:09:19.040" style="s2">you might even be a hero right you might</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.200" end="00:09:22.080" style="s2">be awarded the iron cross</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.040" end="00:09:23.519" style="s2">or people at home might look up to you</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.080" end="00:09:25.279" style="s2">so there&#39;s something interesting about</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.519" end="00:09:27.360" style="s2">this direction of violence</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.279" end="00:09:30.640" style="s2">and this moral intuition of where things</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.360" end="00:09:30.640" style="s2">come from or don&#39;t come from</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.959" end="00:09:34.240" style="s2">i think that our default intuitions rely</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.760" end="00:09:36.560" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.240" end="00:09:38.320" style="s2">this kind of very interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.560" end="00:09:40.240" style="s2">accounting to forgive someone</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.320" end="00:09:42.720" style="s2">we have to personally verify them we</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.240" end="00:09:44.959" style="s2">have to see them we have to know them</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.720" end="00:09:46.959" style="s2">it&#39;s not really possible to smooth over</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.959" end="00:09:48.080" style="s2">all social interactions we might trust</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.959" end="00:09:50.720" style="s2">our judgment</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.080" end="00:09:52.959" style="s2">to someone else say um you know my</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.720" end="00:09:55.760" style="s2">cousin is wronged by someone</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.959" end="00:09:57.120" style="s2">then my cousin forgives that person but</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.760" end="00:09:59.760" style="s2">should i</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.120" end="00:10:00.880" style="s2">forgive the person that slighted my</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.760" end="00:10:03.279" style="s2">cousin that either</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.880" end="00:10:04.000" style="s2">cheated them out of a deal or assaulted</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.279" end="00:10:07.200" style="s2">them or something</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.000" end="00:10:08.720" style="s2">like that well for that to happen there</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.200" end="00:10:09.519" style="s2">has to be some way for my cousin to</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.720" end="00:10:11.360" style="s2">communicate no</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.519" end="00:10:12.800" style="s2">no i&#39;m quite serious i&#39;m not being</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.360" end="00:10:16.240" style="s2">modest</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.800" end="00:10:18.320" style="s2">i in fact absolve this person even that</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.240" end="00:10:20.320" style="s2">simple level right this very small level</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.320" end="00:10:21.200" style="s2">where you might imagine a few families</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.320" end="00:10:24.240" style="s2">and so on</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.200" end="00:10:25.600" style="s2">might require a public act well in whose</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.240" end="00:10:27.600" style="s2">name is the public act</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.600" end="00:10:29.440" style="s2">selected like why are people gathered</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.600" end="00:10:31.680" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.440" end="00:10:35.200" style="s2">to say something like oh we&#39;re gathered</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.680" end="00:10:38.160" style="s2">together in the name of this community</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.200" end="00:10:40.399" style="s2">already quietly well the community must</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.160" end="00:10:42.720" style="s2">have some purpose beyond itself</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.399" end="00:10:44.320" style="s2">communities perhaps can be stores of</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.720" end="00:10:46.640" style="s2">knowledge right such as communities of</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.320" end="00:10:49.279" style="s2">practice or can be stores of uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.640" end="00:10:51.120" style="s2">you know they can be uh stores of</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.279" end="00:10:53.360" style="s2">resources we can communally manage</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.120" end="00:10:55.440" style="s2">resources</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.360" end="00:10:56.399" style="s2">but communities are never a purpose in</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.440" end="00:10:58.160" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.399" end="00:10:59.600" style="s2">there&#39;s always some sort of external</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.160" end="00:11:01.120" style="s2">purpose for their being something that</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.600" end="00:11:03.519" style="s2">gives them legitimacy</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.120" end="00:11:05.040" style="s2">right when we say well this community</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.519" end="00:11:06.959" style="s2">has to self-regulate</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.040" end="00:11:08.640" style="s2">are you talking about a company are you</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.959" end="00:11:10.800" style="s2">talking about a university</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.640" end="00:11:12.240" style="s2">are you talking about a social grouping</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.800" end="00:11:13.040" style="s2">are you talking about a religious</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.240" end="00:11:14.640" style="s2">fellowship</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.040" end="00:11:16.399" style="s2">each of these will have a different</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.640" end="00:11:19.360" style="s2">embedded justification</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.399" end="00:11:21.040" style="s2">so for me to forgive my cousins uh the</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.360" end="00:11:22.240" style="s2">person that wronged my cousin right or</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.040" end="00:11:24.959" style="s2">the person that wronged</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.240" end="00:11:27.040" style="s2">me if i want to make this clear to those</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.959" end="00:11:29.200" style="s2">who might be interested in me</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.040" end="00:11:30.880" style="s2">we already have to gather the community</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.200" end="00:11:32.079" style="s2">and we also have to have a story of why</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.880" end="00:11:35.519" style="s2">this community</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.079" end="00:11:38.720" style="s2">exists in the first place why it&#39;s valid</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.519" end="00:11:41.760" style="s2">why it&#39;s valid at all so</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.720" end="00:11:42.000" style="s2">i think this is uh this is quite unusual</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.760" end="00:11:44.240" style="s2">why</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.000" end="00:11:46.000" style="s2">would we have to justify these everyday</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.240" end="00:11:48.399" style="s2">communities through some purpose but</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.000" end="00:11:50.160" style="s2">we actually do we do this all the time</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.399" end="00:11:50.399" style="s2">the only partial exception i can think</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.160" end="00:11:53.440" style="s2">of</p>

<p begin="00:11:53.440" end="00:11:59.760" style="s2">family units need all sorts of intricate</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.639" end="00:12:01.920" style="s2">theological justification at times or</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.760" end="00:12:03.519" style="s2">other types of justification there were</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.920" end="00:12:05.360" style="s2">very serious arguments in early</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.519" end="00:12:08.320" style="s2">christianity whether the correct move</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.360" end="00:12:10.240" style="s2">is to be unmarried right and there had</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.320" end="00:12:12.639" style="s2">to be significant debates back and forth</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.240" end="00:12:14.320" style="s2">to say no no it is okay to be married</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.639" end="00:12:16.160" style="s2">it&#39;s still important to be fruitful and</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.320" end="00:12:18.639" style="s2">to reproduce</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.160" end="00:12:20.560" style="s2">um similar debates can be found in</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.639" end="00:12:21.519" style="s2">eastern monasticism with regard to</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.560" end="00:12:23.519" style="s2">enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.519" end="00:12:25.600" style="s2">well is it even possible to practice</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.519" end="00:12:27.440" style="s2">non-attachment if you have children</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.600" end="00:12:29.040" style="s2">aren&#39;t children like perhaps your own</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.440" end="00:12:30.800" style="s2">children the most</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.040" end="00:12:33.279" style="s2">the thing that most attack you must be</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.800" end="00:12:35.519" style="s2">most attached to right</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.279" end="00:12:36.800" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t they be a source of suffering</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.519" end="00:12:38.560" style="s2">aren&#39;t you exposing</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.800" end="00:12:40.240" style="s2">them to suffering right maybe we should</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.560" end="00:12:42.000" style="s2">just not have children</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.240" end="00:12:43.920" style="s2">and if you look at people as purely</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.000" end="00:12:46.000" style="s2">biological machines this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.920" end="00:12:48.880" style="s2">question doesn&#39;t really arise</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.000" end="00:12:50.560" style="s2">um but i think that&#39;s not quite right so</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.880" end="00:12:51.360" style="s2">this i think possibly brings to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.560" end="00:12:53.600" style="s2">third feature</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.360" end="00:12:55.519" style="s2">the first feature is legitimizing things</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.600" end="00:12:58.480" style="s2">by making them seem more powerful</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.519" end="00:13:00.240" style="s2">so this is unmoving unchangeable such as</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.480" end="00:13:02.720" style="s2">the natural law of things</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.240" end="00:13:03.519" style="s2">gods or heaven or whatever set things to</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.720" end="00:13:05.519" style="s2">be so</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.519" end="00:13:08.240" style="s2">you know the creator endowed people with</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.519" end="00:13:11.600" style="s2">rights don&#39;t ask for their questions</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.240" end="00:13:13.120" style="s2">uh second is making social rituals that</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.600" end="00:13:15.040" style="s2">manage the community</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.120" end="00:13:16.959" style="s2">legible and then in the organized</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.040" end="00:13:18.320" style="s2">religious context not only is the</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.959" end="00:13:21.360" style="s2">forgiveness ritual</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.320" end="00:13:23.360" style="s2">or the ostracization ritual</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.360" end="00:13:24.800" style="s2">uh standard in a single community you</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.360" end="00:13:26.000" style="s2">standardized it all around the</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.800" end="00:13:28.480" style="s2">mediterranean</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.000" end="00:13:29.760" style="s2">uh in say the late roman empire right</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.480" end="00:13:31.760" style="s2">the roman empire actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.760" end="00:13:34.800" style="s2">innovates by introducing a state</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.760" end="00:13:36.720" style="s2">religion that is much more standardized</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.800" end="00:13:38.160" style="s2">when it adopts christianity than what</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.720" end="00:13:40.639" style="s2">existed before</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.160" end="00:13:42.240" style="s2">the council of constantine makes the</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.639" end="00:13:44.240" style="s2">roman empire christian</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.240" end="00:13:46.000" style="s2">by standardizing what it means to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.240" end="00:13:47.279" style="s2">christian previously the borders were</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.000" end="00:13:48.880" style="s2">very diffused</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.279" end="00:13:50.720" style="s2">and there were all sorts of syncretic</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.880" end="00:13:52.079" style="s2">religions and beliefs and there were</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.720" end="00:13:54.639" style="s2">other movements such as the</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.079" end="00:13:56.079" style="s2">mithraist religion and so on that were</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.639" end="00:13:58.399" style="s2">had comparable attraction</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.079" end="00:14:00.160" style="s2">right and of course various</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.399" end="00:14:01.760" style="s2">philosophical revival movements they</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.160" end="00:14:04.560" style="s2">were much more popular</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.760" end="00:14:06.639" style="s2">among the intelligentsia but a</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.560" end="00:14:09.120" style="s2">philosophical movement has to have these</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.639" end="00:14:11.279" style="s2">mechanisms of</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.120" end="00:14:12.720" style="s2">resolution of dispute right of</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.279" end="00:14:15.279" style="s2">resolution of dispute</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.720" end="00:14:17.120" style="s2">so beyond those two the third one the</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.279" end="00:14:20.000" style="s2">third really important function</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.120" end="00:14:21.680" style="s2">um that we could give is it provides an</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.000" end="00:14:25.360" style="s2">account of what human beings</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.680" end="00:14:26.800" style="s2">are now you can have a secular religion</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.360" end="00:14:28.959" style="s2">in this sense of the word you can have a</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.800" end="00:14:31.279" style="s2">secular anthropology</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.959" end="00:14:32.800" style="s2">that might appeal say to a more</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.279" end="00:14:36.240" style="s2">materialist context</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.800" end="00:14:39.199" style="s2">or a more neutral context</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.240" end="00:14:41.440" style="s2">you might propose that okay we basically</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.199" end="00:14:42.000" style="s2">buy the evo psych story this defines who</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.440" end="00:14:44.880" style="s2">we are</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.000" end="00:14:46.560" style="s2">what we&#39;re for but the act of telling</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.880" end="00:14:49.279" style="s2">people what they are</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.560" end="00:14:51.040" style="s2">you know they live up to it right so</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.279" end="00:14:54.000" style="s2">it&#39;s not chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.040" end="00:14:54.880" style="s2">it&#39;s not physics you explain to human</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.000" end="00:14:58.160" style="s2">beings what they</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.880" end="00:14:59.760" style="s2">are and then they do quite their best</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.160" end="00:15:01.279" style="s2">to live up to whatever the description</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.760" end="00:15:03.279" style="s2">you gave them</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.279" end="00:15:04.800" style="s2">so how do you pick between several</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.279" end="00:15:08.399" style="s2">possible descriptions of</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.800" end="00:15:11.839" style="s2">what humans are well that usually was</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.399" end="00:15:12.880" style="s2">the position of the official religion of</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.839" end="00:15:16.720" style="s2">a society</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.880" end="00:15:18.880" style="s2">or its dominant ideology i think that</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.720" end="00:15:21.199" style="s2">the exact question as to what is a</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.880" end="00:15:24.079" style="s2">religion and what is a philosophy is</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.199" end="00:15:24.639" style="s2">fuzzy but some sort of supernatural</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.079" end="00:15:27.680" style="s2">claim</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.639" end="00:15:29.360" style="s2">is the usual distinguishing factor</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.680" end="00:15:31.120" style="s2">i think that it&#39;s a relatively</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.360" end="00:15:32.399" style="s2">artificial division right i think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.120" end="00:15:34.399" style="s2">division that was</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.399" end="00:15:36.560" style="s2">introduced partially just to end the</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.399" end="00:15:37.519" style="s2">wars of religion in the 16th and 17th</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.560" end="00:15:40.800" style="s2">century</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.519" end="00:15:43.920" style="s2">so almost any worldview you can think of</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.800" end="00:15:45.199" style="s2">for example marxism or liberalism has</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.920" end="00:15:48.079" style="s2">metaphysical claims</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.199" end="00:15:50.720" style="s2">embedded in it that are as difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.079" end="00:15:52.880" style="s2">justify on purely rational grounds</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.720" end="00:15:54.000" style="s2">as any other supernatural belief system</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.880" end="00:15:57.440" style="s2">such as hinduism</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.000" end="00:15:58.959" style="s2">or islam or christianity</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.440" end="00:16:01.440" style="s2">so okay this is a good spot for</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.959" end="00:16:05.040" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.440" end="00:16:06.720" style="s2">open the floor great so yeah if anybody</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.040" end="00:16:07.360" style="s2">has any questions you can just go ahead</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.720" end="00:16:08.959" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.360" end="00:16:10.720" style="s2">type them into the chat and then i will</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.959" end="00:16:12.000" style="s2">call your name in the order that you ask</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.720" end="00:16:15.440" style="s2">your questions</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.000" end="00:16:18.720" style="s2">and we can get started</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.440" end="00:16:21.920" style="s2">so samo i&#39;m actually kind of curious</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.720" end="00:16:23.680" style="s2">as to your inspiration for bringing this</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.920" end="00:16:26.000" style="s2">topic to us today</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.680" end="00:16:27.680" style="s2">it&#39;s very interesting to me because i</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.000" end="00:16:28.639" style="s2">feel like i&#39;ve been seeing a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.680" end="00:16:30.639" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.639" end="00:16:31.680" style="s2">start talking about institutional</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.639" end="00:16:34.079" style="s2">religion</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.680" end="00:16:36.480" style="s2">just in the last like few days so it</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.079" end="00:16:36.800" style="s2">feels like a synchronicity that here you</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.480" end="00:16:40.000" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.800" end="00:16:40.639" style="s2">bringing this to live players so i mean</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.000" end="00:16:42.399" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.639" end="00:16:43.680" style="s2">very possible i haven&#39;t been much on</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.399" end="00:16:47.360" style="s2">twitter but uh</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.680" end="00:16:49.839" style="s2">these things often move very indirectly</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.360" end="00:16:50.959" style="s2">yeah so can you what what gave you the</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.839" end="00:16:54.800" style="s2">inspiration for this</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.959" end="00:16:57.519" style="s2">for the subject i think it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.800" end="00:16:59.279" style="s2">it was the one relatively large area of</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.519" end="00:17:01.519" style="s2">social technology that they left</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.279" end="00:17:02.639" style="s2">untouched even though it&#39;s so massively</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.519" end="00:17:04.480" style="s2">central</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.639" end="00:17:05.760" style="s2">the three other biggest things you can</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.480" end="00:17:07.600" style="s2">really think of is</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.760" end="00:17:09.280" style="s2">basically formation of these sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.600" end="00:17:10.959" style="s2">state structures</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.280" end="00:17:12.640" style="s2">and how cities work and i think i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.959" end="00:17:16.799" style="s2">touched on both perhaps a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.640" end="00:17:19.839" style="s2">less on cities than on state structures</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.799" end="00:17:22.480" style="s2">and they have the organized religion</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.839" end="00:17:23.360" style="s2">set up seems to be the only one that</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.480" end="00:17:27.120" style="s2">scales</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.360" end="00:17:30.720" style="s2">so very well right it scales better than</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.120" end="00:17:33.679" style="s2">states even today you have</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.720" end="00:17:34.799" style="s2">um people who are nominally in the same</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.679" end="00:17:37.280" style="s2">religious community</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.799" end="00:17:39.760" style="s2">and it can number it can number in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.280" end="00:17:39.760" style="s2">billions</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.080" end="00:17:43.520" style="s2">the roman state religion right or its</p>

<p begin="00:17:51.760" end="00:17:55.520" style="s2">and what are the implications for live</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.400" end="00:17:58.840" style="s2">players</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.520" end="00:18:00.400" style="s2">within this uh within religious</p>

<p begin="00:18:00.400" end="00:18:05.120" style="s2">i think that i think that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.600" end="00:18:07.600" style="s2">very much the case that whenever</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.120" end="00:18:09.039" style="s2">organized religion has a growth spurt</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.600" end="00:18:10.720" style="s2">like a creation of a bunch of new</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.039" end="00:18:12.880" style="s2">institutions that are supporting the</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.720" end="00:18:15.679" style="s2">religion standardizing the religions</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.880" end="00:18:16.880" style="s2">spreading the religion changing its</p>

<p begin="00:18:16.880" end="00:18:21.200" style="s2">changing what amounts to basically</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.640" end="00:18:23.200" style="s2">social law right so law that regulates</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.200" end="00:18:24.880" style="s2">interpersonal behavior and standards of</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.200" end="00:18:28.240" style="s2">behavior</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.880" end="00:18:32.080" style="s2">all of that stuff is requires live</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.240" end="00:18:34.400" style="s2">player uh adaptation and change</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.080" end="00:18:35.919" style="s2">in its absence it decays like anything</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.400" end="00:18:38.000" style="s2">else</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.919" end="00:18:39.600" style="s2">so you know you can still square this</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.000" end="00:18:41.360" style="s2">with a supernatural view you could have</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.600" end="00:18:42.080" style="s2">a view that you know every generation</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.360" end="00:18:44.480" style="s2">needs</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.080" end="00:18:46.160" style="s2">a new prophet with god talking to them</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.480" end="00:18:47.120" style="s2">correcting whatever ways they&#39;ve gone</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.160" end="00:18:49.039" style="s2">often</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.120" end="00:18:50.960" style="s2">right the old testament is very much in</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.039" end="00:18:52.400" style="s2">favor of this because the prophets are</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.960" end="00:18:52.720" style="s2">always these people who aren&#39;t listened</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.400" end="00:18:55.120" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.720" end="00:18:57.440" style="s2">these people who are sort of like trying</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.120" end="00:18:59.440" style="s2">to correct this or that</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.440" end="00:19:02.080" style="s2">um i think the better perspective is</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.440" end="00:19:05.520" style="s2">more along the lines that</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.080" end="00:19:08.840" style="s2">uh i do think that</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.520" end="00:19:10.320" style="s2">religions can be redefined fairly</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.840" end="00:19:13.520" style="s2">flexibly</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.320" end="00:19:14.480" style="s2">actual day-to-day beliefs are regulated</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.520" end="00:19:17.280" style="s2">less than</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.480" end="00:19:19.679" style="s2">outward appearances and of course</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.280" end="00:19:20.720" style="s2">outward appearances are tied to genuine</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.679" end="00:19:22.720" style="s2">beliefs as well</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.720" end="00:19:25.039" style="s2">i&#39;m not saying i&#39;m not saying that none</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.720" end="00:19:25.360" style="s2">of the people&#39;s beliefs change once you</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.039" end="00:19:29.039" style="s2">come</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.360" end="00:19:33.760" style="s2">out from christianity oh</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.039" end="00:19:36.880" style="s2">sorry i&#39;m sorry no problem um</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.760" end="00:19:38.480" style="s2">i&#39;m not saying that you know no</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.880" end="00:19:40.559" style="s2">fundamental belief changes</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.480" end="00:19:41.600" style="s2">but the fact is that say you might</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.559" end="00:19:43.840" style="s2">celebrate</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.600" end="00:19:45.760" style="s2">uh you might celebrate solstice and you</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.840" end="00:19:46.799" style="s2">replace it with a celebration of</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.760" end="00:19:48.799" style="s2">christmas</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.799" end="00:19:50.559" style="s2">or you when you&#39;re trying to secularize</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.799" end="00:19:52.720" style="s2">a country you might replace</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.559" end="00:19:53.760" style="s2">or replace the christmas tree with the</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.720" end="00:19:56.000" style="s2">new year tree</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.760" end="00:19:56.880" style="s2">as happened in eastern europe but</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.000" end="00:19:59.520" style="s2">somehow</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.880" end="00:20:01.280" style="s2">this pattern of celebration dates of</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.520" end="00:20:03.679" style="s2">celebration</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.280" end="00:20:04.880" style="s2">particular practices even like you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.679" end="00:20:08.080" style="s2">sacrificing</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.880" end="00:20:09.760" style="s2">offering small offerings to stream to</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.080" end="00:20:13.120" style="s2">spirits of streams</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.760" end="00:20:14.960" style="s2">and trees that stuff outlived</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.120" end="00:20:17.039" style="s2">the conversion from paganism the</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.960" end="00:20:19.039" style="s2">conversion to christianity</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.039" end="00:20:21.039" style="s2">by many hundreds of years it was just</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.039" end="00:20:23.360" style="s2">practiced right both in europe and the</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.039" end="00:20:25.520" style="s2">middle east in the 16th century the 17th</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.360" end="00:20:27.440" style="s2">century the 18th century</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.520" end="00:20:28.559" style="s2">it only really vanished when you moved</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.440" end="00:20:31.200" style="s2">masses of people</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.559" end="00:20:33.120" style="s2">well basically when when the</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.200" end="00:20:35.120" style="s2">agricultural revolution</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.120" end="00:20:37.039" style="s2">cut the need to have large rural</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.120" end="00:20:39.039" style="s2">populations and you had heavily</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.039" end="00:20:41.520" style="s2">urbanized populations</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.039" end="00:20:42.960" style="s2">those populations recently removed from</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.520" end="00:20:44.960" style="s2">their old physical environments</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.960" end="00:20:47.120" style="s2">necessarily have to acquire new habits</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.960" end="00:20:49.120" style="s2">rather than continue old habits</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.120" end="00:20:50.799" style="s2">that changes those little beliefs right</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.120" end="00:20:51.520" style="s2">the kind of things where a particular</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.799" end="00:20:53.520" style="s2">stream</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.520" end="00:20:54.559" style="s2">it might be bad luck to cross it without</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.520" end="00:20:57.840" style="s2">doing this</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.559" end="00:20:59.440" style="s2">or that uh local superstition that does</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.840" end="00:21:01.200" style="s2">not change just because</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.440" end="00:21:03.600" style="s2">you know your ruler says you are now</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.200" end="00:21:06.720" style="s2">christian or you spoke to the right</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.600" end="00:21:09.440" style="s2">missionary and you&#39;re now buddhist or</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.720" end="00:21:10.559" style="s2">you know you you&#39;ve been converted to</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.440" end="00:21:12.799" style="s2">christianity</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.559" end="00:21:14.000" style="s2">like that sort of that sort of stuff is</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.799" end="00:21:17.760" style="s2">difficult to change</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.000" end="00:21:19.679" style="s2">so i think because of this</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.760" end="00:21:21.600" style="s2">outward transitions of religion can</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.679" end="00:21:24.320" style="s2">happen far faster</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.600" end="00:21:26.559" style="s2">than people assume they can so while the</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.320" end="00:21:27.120" style="s2">pattern of a particular religion can be</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.559" end="00:21:29.520" style="s2">stable</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.120" end="00:21:31.280" style="s2">for a long time possibly just because</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.520" end="00:21:34.880" style="s2">it&#39;s such a difficult design to get</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.280" end="00:21:37.520" style="s2">right the geographical extent of it</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.880" end="00:21:39.280" style="s2">the number of people attached to it</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.520" end="00:21:40.320" style="s2">using it as the standard of</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.280" end="00:21:43.440" style="s2">interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.320" end="00:21:45.039" style="s2">dispute resolution of regulation that</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.440" end="00:21:48.159" style="s2">can change massively in a single</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.039" end="00:21:50.000" style="s2">generation like two or three generations</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.159" end="00:21:52.240" style="s2">are enough to completely change the</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.000" end="00:21:56.640" style="s2">religion of a society</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.240" end="00:21:56.640" style="s2">not its culture but just the religion of</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.840" end="00:22:01.280" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.559" end="00:22:12.080" style="s2">great thank you paul would you like to</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.280" end="00:22:14.400" style="s2">ask your question</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.080" end="00:22:15.600" style="s2">well i was just interested in the idea</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.400" end="00:22:18.880" style="s2">of metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.600" end="00:22:19.600" style="s2">uh propositions embedded in things that</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.880" end="00:22:21.840" style="s2">we don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.600" end="00:22:23.039" style="s2">of the things that we think of that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.840" end="00:22:26.159" style="s2">fairly</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.039" end="00:22:28.400" style="s2">realistic um</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.159" end="00:22:30.240" style="s2">i could i can sort of see but i wonder</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.400" end="00:22:34.240" style="s2">if you would expand on</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.240" end="00:22:37.039" style="s2">uh say the metaphysics of</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.240" end="00:22:38.880" style="s2">inside of underneath marxism as opposed</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.039" end="00:22:42.320" style="s2">to the metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.880" end="00:22:44.880" style="s2">underlying liberalism or other things</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.320" end="00:22:44.880" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.440" end="00:22:52.640" style="s2">well i think that the ideologies have</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.400" end="00:22:53.280" style="s2">metaphysical claims now we could tease</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.640" end="00:22:55.679" style="s2">into them</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.280" end="00:22:59.039" style="s2">a little bit more deeply but for</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.679" end="00:23:01.360" style="s2">starters right if we look at marxism</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.039" end="00:23:02.720" style="s2">it&#39;s not like it&#39;s not a hegelian</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.360" end="00:23:04.799" style="s2">ontology</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.720" end="00:23:06.880" style="s2">it&#39;s a materialist variant on the</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.799" end="00:23:08.159" style="s2">hegelian ontology right it starts off</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.880" end="00:23:11.760" style="s2">hegel has this idea</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.159" end="00:23:14.320" style="s2">that through the dialectic of thesis</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.760" end="00:23:15.200" style="s2">and antithesis there comes always a</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.320" end="00:23:16.720" style="s2">synthesis</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.200" end="00:23:19.120" style="s2">and that the entire world is this</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.720" end="00:23:21.360" style="s2">progress of idea influencing idea</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.120" end="00:23:23.200" style="s2">until we reach the mind of god or what</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.360" end="00:23:24.799" style="s2">he said was the mind of perfection the</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.200" end="00:23:26.720" style="s2">state of absolute truth</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.799" end="00:23:28.240" style="s2">which then you know he he equated with</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.720" end="00:23:30.080" style="s2">god in some writings and</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.240" end="00:23:31.840" style="s2">choose to not equate with god in other</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.080" end="00:23:34.880" style="s2">writings</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.840" end="00:23:36.559" style="s2">that transformed to there are stages of</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.880" end="00:23:38.559" style="s2">material progress</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.559" end="00:23:40.320" style="s2">right where material conditions give</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.559" end="00:23:42.159" style="s2">rise to new material conditions</p>

<p begin="00:23:42.159" end="00:23:46.320" style="s2">that eventually lead</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.600" end="00:23:49.279" style="s2">to a transformation of production and</p>

<p begin="00:23:49.279" end="00:23:52.320" style="s2">the implicit claim there of course is</p>

<p begin="00:23:52.320" end="00:23:57.120" style="s2">right the that&#39;s the strongest one while</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.279" end="00:23:59.120" style="s2">materialism is very difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.120" end="00:24:02.159" style="s2">establish metaphysically</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.120" end="00:24:03.200" style="s2">if you try to defeat sopsism as an</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.159" end="00:24:06.000" style="s2">alternative</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.200" end="00:24:07.919" style="s2">to materialism it&#39;s super hard like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.000" end="00:24:09.679" style="s2">very difficult to come up with</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.919" end="00:24:12.240" style="s2">you know any kind of argument that</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.679" end="00:24:14.960" style="s2">really does that persuasively or simply</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.240" end="00:24:15.279" style="s2">sopsism being the belief that all of</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.960" end="00:24:17.520" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.279" end="00:24:19.279" style="s2">is a dream this is just an illusion that</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.520" end="00:24:20.880" style="s2">i have there are many people who are</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.279" end="00:24:22.880" style="s2">effectively self-cystic</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.880" end="00:24:24.320" style="s2">even while say claiming to believe other</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.880" end="00:24:26.000" style="s2">things and you kind of poke into them</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.320" end="00:24:26.720" style="s2">and you realize oh wait they are so</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.000" end="00:24:29.120" style="s2">cystic</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.720" end="00:24:30.880" style="s2">right they don&#39;t think any of this is</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.120" end="00:24:33.840" style="s2">real in this metaphysical sense or</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.880" end="00:24:37.200" style="s2">ontologically basic</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.840" end="00:24:40.400" style="s2">philosophies would you say a sister</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.200" end="00:24:45.200" style="s2">i&#39;m sorry i didn&#39;t understand which</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.400" end="00:24:47.200" style="s2">philosophies uh are so cystic</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.200" end="00:24:50.240" style="s2">well i think i think many individuals</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.200" end="00:24:52.960" style="s2">are very selfish i think that um</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.240" end="00:24:54.080" style="s2">i think a lot of the people who work</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.960" end="00:24:57.120" style="s2">very deeply</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.080" end="00:24:59.279" style="s2">in media work and language work</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.120" end="00:25:01.919" style="s2">might believe that all reality is social</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.279" end="00:25:03.919" style="s2">construct and has no material construct</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.919" end="00:25:06.320" style="s2">some of those are basically pan</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.919" end="00:25:08.159" style="s2">psychists and believe in the reality</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.320" end="00:25:09.840" style="s2">of thought and the reality of other</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.159" end="00:25:13.440" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.840" end="00:25:14.159" style="s2">but others are more narcissistically</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.440" end="00:25:15.840" style="s2">oriented</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.159" end="00:25:17.120" style="s2">right and when i say narcissistic here i</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.840" end="00:25:19.360" style="s2">don&#39;t necessarily mean that they love</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.120" end="00:25:22.159" style="s2">themselves they might hate themselves</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.360" end="00:25:24.960" style="s2">but it&#39;s more this question of is like</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.159" end="00:25:28.000" style="s2">material reality this table this laptop</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.960" end="00:25:29.760" style="s2">is this is this there right</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.000" end="00:25:31.120" style="s2">um there are some people that are</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.760" end="00:25:34.400" style="s2">committed to variants</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.120" end="00:25:35.919" style="s2">of sopsism you could find some types of</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.400" end="00:25:38.000" style="s2">buddhism that would endorse it</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.919" end="00:25:40.000" style="s2">but for the most part this is like not</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.000" end="00:25:42.000" style="s2">explicitly endorsed right</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.000" end="00:25:43.279" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t make a good shilling point</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.000" end="00:25:45.679" style="s2">it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.279" end="00:25:46.400" style="s2">it&#39;s not a good protocol to interact</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.679" end="00:25:49.360" style="s2">with others</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.400" end="00:25:50.799" style="s2">so i think solipsism while popular i</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.360" end="00:25:53.440" style="s2">think easily 10 to 20</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.799" end="00:25:54.240" style="s2">of the population are so cystic usually</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.440" end="00:25:56.640" style="s2">does not find</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.240" end="00:25:57.840" style="s2">an organized explicit endorsed</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.640" end="00:25:59.520" style="s2">expression</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.840" end="00:26:01.520" style="s2">so you have kind of have to talk to a</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.520" end="00:26:04.960" style="s2">person for a while before they</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.520" end="00:26:07.279" style="s2">basically say that they are sophistic</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.960" end="00:26:08.960" style="s2">i&#39;m a buddhist i don&#39;t like that aspect</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.279" end="00:26:12.720" style="s2">but it does seem to me to me</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.960" end="00:26:12.720" style="s2">basically solidification</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.880" end="00:26:20.000" style="s2">nothing that we see is really</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.919" end="00:26:22.400" style="s2">there we&#39;re really real</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.000" end="00:26:24.400" style="s2">right right and of course again this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.400" end="00:26:27.039" style="s2">just one possible metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.400" end="00:26:28.000" style="s2">assumption and again that i used marxism</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.039" end="00:26:30.240" style="s2">as an example</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.000" end="00:26:31.360" style="s2">to illustrate how a seemingly secular</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.240" end="00:26:33.200" style="s2">ideology does make</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.360" end="00:26:34.799" style="s2">metaphysical claims and the metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.200" end="00:26:37.120" style="s2">claims are you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.799" end="00:26:38.960" style="s2">if you accept the premises you can use</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.120" end="00:26:39.840" style="s2">the premises to show that the premises</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.960" end="00:26:41.679" style="s2">are true</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.840" end="00:26:43.600" style="s2">and if you reject the premises it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.679" end="00:26:44.400" style="s2">difficult to show that the premises are</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.600" end="00:26:48.000" style="s2">true</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.400" end="00:26:48.000" style="s2">right if you don&#39;t already assume them</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.159" end="00:26:54.559" style="s2">great we have a question from peter</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.360" end="00:26:54.559" style="s2">would you like to ask your question</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.240" end="00:27:07.840" style="s2">if he doesn&#39;t i can also just read the</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.559" end="00:27:11.360" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.840" end="00:27:13.679" style="s2">um so peter says</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.360" end="00:27:15.520" style="s2">curious to hear samo expand on his theme</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.679" end="00:27:17.039" style="s2">of millennials underperforming at</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.520" end="00:27:18.480" style="s2">acquiring power</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.039" end="00:27:20.399" style="s2">possibly because of missing</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.480" end="00:27:22.640" style="s2">interpersonal skills</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.399" end="00:27:24.159" style="s2">i recently shared a tweet where i said</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.640" end="00:27:26.159" style="s2">that it seems that the only type of</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.159" end="00:27:26.880" style="s2">power millennials understand is media</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.159" end="00:27:28.799" style="s2">power</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.880" end="00:27:30.320" style="s2">behind this statement is of course also</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.799" end="00:27:30.799" style="s2">the realization that throughout their</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.320" end="00:27:33.200" style="s2">lives</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.799" end="00:27:34.880" style="s2">as they were growing up the only right</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.200" end="00:27:36.399" style="s2">the only kind of power they really</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.880" end="00:27:39.440" style="s2">experienced was sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.399" end="00:27:43.600" style="s2">becoming hermione granger that is</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.440" end="00:27:46.080" style="s2">cohering conforming being teacher&#39;s pet</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.600" end="00:27:46.880" style="s2">appealing maybe complaining maybe</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.080" end="00:27:49.039" style="s2">protesting</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.880" end="00:27:50.240" style="s2">always asking an external authority that</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.039" end="00:27:53.360" style="s2">was unchallenged</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.240" end="00:27:55.039" style="s2">unchallengeable and far away</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.360" end="00:27:57.039" style="s2">and the only tool you really have in</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.039" end="00:28:00.720" style="s2">that situation be it with um</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.039" end="00:28:03.279" style="s2">parents or teachers or your boss</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.720" end="00:28:04.640" style="s2">is this kind of verbal manipulation so</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.279" end="00:28:06.000" style="s2">they start to conflate verbal</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.640" end="00:28:08.640" style="s2">manipulation to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.000" end="00:28:10.559" style="s2">the full spectrum of power and they</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.640" end="00:28:12.240" style="s2">themselves are starved of material</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.559" end="00:28:13.840" style="s2">resources compared to previous</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.240" end="00:28:15.279" style="s2">generations now if you look at the us</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.840" end="00:28:16.399" style="s2">distribution of wealth you go by</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.279" end="00:28:17.840" style="s2">generations</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.399" end="00:28:19.679" style="s2">right now it&#39;s very heavily biased</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.840" end="00:28:21.600" style="s2">towards older generations</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.679" end="00:28:23.360" style="s2">no people like to simplify this and say</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.600" end="00:28:24.159" style="s2">it&#39;s like boomers versus millennials or</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.360" end="00:28:26.559" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.159" end="00:28:28.240" style="s2">but look at gen x people gen x people</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.559" end="00:28:30.480" style="s2">have more wealth than millennials</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.240" end="00:28:31.760" style="s2">millennials have more wealth than you</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.480" end="00:28:34.399" style="s2">know gen z</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.760" end="00:28:35.200" style="s2">zoomers right uh the very youngest</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.399" end="00:28:37.919" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.200" end="00:28:39.120" style="s2">and not only do they have less wealth</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.919" end="00:28:41.039" style="s2">because they&#39;re at the start of their</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.120" end="00:28:43.840" style="s2">careers they have less wealth than</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.039" end="00:28:44.320" style="s2">previous generations had at the same age</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.840" end="00:28:47.279" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.320" end="00:28:47.760" style="s2">so so much of our inequality is age</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.279" end="00:28:50.960" style="s2">coded</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.760" end="00:28:50.960" style="s2">it&#39;s age distributed</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.279" end="00:28:55.039" style="s2">because of this it&#39;s sort of like very</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.360" end="00:28:56.000" style="s2">and it&#39;s surprisingly difficult to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.039" end="00:28:58.880" style="s2">upwardly</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.000" end="00:29:00.000" style="s2">mobile both in u.s and western society</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.880" end="00:29:02.720" style="s2">right now so</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.000" end="00:29:03.600" style="s2">money is mostly not a viable source of</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.720" end="00:29:06.399" style="s2">power</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.600" end="00:29:07.440" style="s2">and in fact money can&#39;t buy you a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:29:07.440" end="00:29:11.120" style="s2">most valuable not most valuable in this</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.360" end="00:29:13.120" style="s2">feel-good way of like you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.120" end="00:29:15.120" style="s2">the things that truly matter like you</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.120" end="00:29:17.520" style="s2">know your your parents love or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.120" end="00:29:18.399" style="s2">i mean just very very practical things</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.520" end="00:29:21.679" style="s2">such as</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.399" end="00:29:24.960" style="s2">how can i use money to buy my way out of</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.679" end="00:29:28.240" style="s2">being kicked out of my own company</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.960" end="00:29:29.840" style="s2">you can definitely you know even i think</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.240" end="00:29:31.039" style="s2">billionaires have a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.840" end="00:29:33.200" style="s2">class privilege</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.039" end="00:29:34.799" style="s2">but anything below billionaire level can</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.200" end="00:29:36.480" style="s2">get cancelled out of their own</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.799" end="00:29:38.799" style="s2">organization for example</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.480" end="00:29:40.880" style="s2">right can get pushed out either on the</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.799" end="00:29:41.919" style="s2">work side or the anti-woke side it</p>

<p begin="00:29:41.919" end="00:29:46.799" style="s2">conservatives have always had their own</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.679" end="00:29:48.960" style="s2">version of cancellation</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.799" end="00:29:50.640" style="s2">then the next one is uh you know the</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.960" end="00:29:53.279" style="s2">ability to</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.640" end="00:29:54.960" style="s2">build you know physical things organize</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.279" end="00:29:58.399" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.960" end="00:30:00.559" style="s2">organize people create new procedures</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.399" end="00:30:02.320" style="s2">manipulate procedures i would even go as</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.559" end="00:30:03.279" style="s2">far as to argue that millennials don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.320" end="00:30:06.399" style="s2">really understand</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.279" end="00:30:08.159" style="s2">law now law is super verbal</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.399" end="00:30:09.919" style="s2">but it&#39;s not at the level of an</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.159" end="00:30:14.080" style="s2">interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.919" end="00:30:16.720" style="s2">exchange right it&#39;s at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.080" end="00:30:19.039" style="s2">understanding of these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.720" end="00:30:21.679" style="s2">regulations that are distributed</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.039" end="00:30:22.080" style="s2">plus this again practical aspect of what</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.679" end="00:30:24.240" style="s2">does</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.080" end="00:30:26.399" style="s2">or does not apply and what is and is not</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.240" end="00:30:28.799" style="s2">a valid verbal argument</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.399" end="00:30:29.600" style="s2">together with again the right privileges</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.799" end="00:30:31.760" style="s2">right i think if</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.600" end="00:30:33.600" style="s2">you make the exact same legal argument</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.760" end="00:30:35.279" style="s2">as a citizen or as a lawyer</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.600" end="00:30:37.120" style="s2">the argument will in fact be treated</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.279" end="00:30:38.559" style="s2">differently i i believe that</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.120" end="00:30:40.720" style="s2">it&#39;s just very difficult to try to</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.559" end="00:30:42.480" style="s2">convince me out of it possibly</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.720" end="00:30:43.919" style="s2">you know lawyers might be mildly</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.480" end="00:30:45.039" style="s2">offended at this suggestion but i</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.919" end="00:30:46.799" style="s2">believe they are definitely</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.039" end="00:30:48.960" style="s2">they&#39;re definitely a guild that is</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.799" end="00:30:51.440" style="s2">somewhat self-interested</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.960" end="00:30:54.000" style="s2">uh in response to the markers of guild</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.440" end="00:30:55.840" style="s2">belonging or lack of guilt belonging</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.000" end="00:30:57.600" style="s2">but still this is a type of power that</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.840" end="00:30:59.600" style="s2">you would think they would know how to</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.600" end="00:31:02.080" style="s2">grasp but again it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.600" end="00:31:04.159" style="s2">so the only real thing that happens is</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.080" end="00:31:04.880" style="s2">this natural advantage of interfacing</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.159" end="00:31:07.840" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.880" end="00:31:09.600" style="s2">some aspects of digital media and some</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.840" end="00:31:12.880" style="s2">of this aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.600" end="00:31:14.880" style="s2">some interpersonal methods of pressure</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.880" end="00:31:17.519" style="s2">now the key skills that i think are</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.880" end="00:31:20.000" style="s2">missing is that i think millennials were</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.519" end="00:31:21.600" style="s2">much more atomized than some previous</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.000" end="00:31:24.000" style="s2">generations of people</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.600" end="00:31:25.279" style="s2">and they&#39;ve had fewer experiences of</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.000" end="00:31:27.679" style="s2">having open</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.279" end="00:31:28.640" style="s2">leadership positions available to them</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.679" end="00:31:31.200" style="s2">so they&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.640" end="00:31:33.120" style="s2">in terms of leadership skills and again</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.200" end="00:31:35.679" style="s2">this is not to blame them i myself</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.120" end="00:31:37.120" style="s2">am a millennial right it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.679" end="00:31:39.279" style="s2">objectively lower</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.120" end="00:31:42.559" style="s2">than that of baby boomers and is</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.279" end="00:31:45.120" style="s2">objectively lower than that of gen x</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.559" end="00:31:46.399" style="s2">so once those older generations go away</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.120" end="00:31:48.640" style="s2">it&#39;s not like there&#39;s a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.399" end="00:31:50.399" style="s2">flourishing and coming into age and</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.640" end="00:31:52.640" style="s2">coming into reality</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.399" end="00:31:54.240" style="s2">rather it means that the new elite who</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.640" end="00:31:54.880" style="s2">inherits the wealth of the previous</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.240" end="00:31:56.559" style="s2">elite</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.880" end="00:31:58.240" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t really matter for the</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.559" end="00:32:00.080" style="s2">purposes of inequality</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.240" end="00:32:02.880" style="s2">whether it will be the children of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.080" end="00:32:04.640" style="s2">boomers or the lawyers of the boomers</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.880" end="00:32:06.080" style="s2">that inherit the wealth that the baby</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.640" end="00:32:08.960" style="s2">boomers hold</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.080" end="00:32:11.200" style="s2">both are unequal societies right whether</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.960" end="00:32:13.360" style="s2">it&#39;s the lawyers or the children</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.200" end="00:32:15.200" style="s2">the next generation of american elites</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.360" end="00:32:17.120" style="s2">is going to have an impoverished</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.200" end="00:32:19.919" style="s2">understanding of what is power</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.120" end="00:32:20.640" style="s2">what is reality how to achieve things in</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.919" end="00:32:23.039" style="s2">other words</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.640" end="00:32:24.720" style="s2">they will still be elites but they will</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.039" end="00:32:27.120" style="s2">actually know how to wield far</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.720" end="00:32:28.480" style="s2">fewer of the forms of power that are</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.120" end="00:32:31.200" style="s2">available</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.480" end="00:32:33.279" style="s2">meaning that in a way their control over</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.200" end="00:32:33.919" style="s2">society will be lower which is perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.279" end="00:32:35.919" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.919" end="00:32:37.519" style="s2">but in another way the coherence of</p>

<p begin="00:32:37.519" end="00:32:42.640" style="s2">institutions will be radically lower</p>

<p begin="00:32:42.640" end="00:32:45.760" style="s2">hopefully that answers the question</p>

<p begin="00:32:57.919" end="00:33:05.360" style="s2">um my question is a bit generic but</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.679" end="00:33:07.519" style="s2">it&#39;s looking at how national myths</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.360" end="00:33:09.039" style="s2">uh sort of have come to have such a</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.519" end="00:33:10.960" style="s2">strong um</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.039" end="00:33:12.960" style="s2">importance you know maybe especially in</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.960" end="00:33:15.919" style="s2">the 21st century</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.960" end="00:33:17.039" style="s2">have they in some ways replaced uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.919" end="00:33:20.000" style="s2">religious myths</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.039" end="00:33:24.000" style="s2">in in their ability to to coordinate</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.000" end="00:33:26.880" style="s2">mass amounts of the people</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.000" end="00:33:29.360" style="s2">sir could you could you say that again</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.880" end="00:33:31.760" style="s2">my my audio cut out</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.360" end="00:33:32.799" style="s2">sure no worries um looking at how</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.760" end="00:33:35.279" style="s2">national myths</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.799" end="00:33:36.799" style="s2">have gained uh quite a bit of importance</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.279" end="00:33:38.000" style="s2">and you know maybe i&#39;m thinking is</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.799" end="00:33:40.720" style="s2">particular in the 21st</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.000" end="00:33:41.200" style="s2">century have they replaced in some way</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.720" end="00:33:44.320" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.200" end="00:33:46.799" style="s2">the power of religious myths</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.320" end="00:33:50.000" style="s2">at coordinating uh mass amounts of</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.799" end="00:33:53.039" style="s2">people or large societies</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.000" end="00:33:53.760" style="s2">partially yes i think just 19th century</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.039" end="00:33:57.919" style="s2">style</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.760" end="00:33:59.840" style="s2">nation states were significantly</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.919" end="00:34:02.080" style="s2">uh they were digging significantly into</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.840" end="00:34:04.840" style="s2">the same will of resources that was once</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.080" end="00:34:07.440" style="s2">sort of the province of organized</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.840" end="00:34:08.079" style="s2">religion i think 20th century states</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.440" end="00:34:10.720" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.079" end="00:34:11.760" style="s2">added a story of what happens at the end</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.720" end="00:34:14.079" style="s2">of the world</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.760" end="00:34:15.200" style="s2">and this sort of story of why they</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.079" end="00:34:17.599" style="s2">themselves are</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.200" end="00:34:19.119" style="s2">the inevitable consequence of whatever</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.599" end="00:34:21.599" style="s2">is developing in the world</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.119" end="00:34:23.040" style="s2">so i think that yeah to some extent it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.599" end="00:34:24.399" style="s2">been replaced but i think it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.040" end="00:34:26.159" style="s2">replaced through</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.399" end="00:34:28.079" style="s2">evolving in the same direction as</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.159" end="00:34:29.760" style="s2">organized religion</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.079" end="00:34:31.520" style="s2">if this makes sense at least in its in</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.760" end="00:34:33.919" style="s2">its key features right</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.520" end="00:34:34.960" style="s2">um national school curricula in</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.919" end="00:34:36.720" style="s2">particular</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.960" end="00:34:38.960" style="s2">were the biggest convergence between</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.720" end="00:34:42.399" style="s2">states and organized religions</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.960" end="00:34:43.679" style="s2">up until you know about 1800 the idea</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.399" end="00:34:45.839" style="s2">that you could get</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.679" end="00:34:47.040" style="s2">all the children in the country reading</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.839" end="00:34:49.280" style="s2">the same text</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.040" end="00:34:50.560" style="s2">is only really achievable to a religious</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.280" end="00:34:52.320" style="s2">authority</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.560" end="00:34:53.599" style="s2">after that it&#39;s sort of like you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.320" end="00:34:56.960" style="s2">any petty</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.599" end="00:35:02.640" style="s2">any petty bureaucrat that uh gets on the</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.960" end="00:35:06.000" style="s2">texas board of education or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.640" end="00:35:08.560" style="s2">cool hopefully that answers the question</p>

<p begin="00:35:17.119" end="00:35:19.359" style="s2">sense of prosperity but in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.040" end="00:35:22.320" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.359" end="00:35:23.599" style="s2">um we&#39;re no longer a democratic republic</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.320" end="00:35:25.440" style="s2">but pretend to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.599" end="00:35:26.880" style="s2">or not and i kind of think about the</p>

<p begin="00:35:35.599" end="00:35:41.359" style="s2">well i think the u.s president is</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.800" end="00:35:43.520" style="s2">uh the emperor of japan and not the</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.359" end="00:35:46.800" style="s2">shogun of japan</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.520" end="00:35:47.440" style="s2">by which i mean that he has ceremonial</p>

<p begin="00:35:47.440" end="00:35:51.440" style="s2">right and everyone sort of on a gut</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.839" end="00:35:52.720" style="s2">level if you talk to americans you</p>

<p begin="00:35:52.720" end="00:35:56.560" style="s2">the president runs the country right</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.880" end="00:35:57.599" style="s2">just on this kind of like emotional</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.560" end="00:35:59.280" style="s2">believed level</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.599" end="00:36:00.800" style="s2">not on the rational level though say</p>

<p begin="00:36:00.800" end="00:36:03.200" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.440" end="00:36:05.200" style="s2">but the president is assumed to run the</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.200" end="00:36:07.280" style="s2">country and there&#39;s a general</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.200" end="00:36:08.960" style="s2">obsession with the presidential election</p>

<p begin="00:36:10.079" end="00:36:13.760" style="s2">influence government with i think the</p>

<p begin="00:36:13.760" end="00:36:17.440" style="s2">is stronger than ever and the president</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.160" end="00:36:21.119" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.440" end="00:36:23.200" style="s2">not weaker than ever but weaker than the</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.119" end="00:36:25.440" style="s2">president was 50 years ago i think the</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.200" end="00:36:28.079" style="s2">president is currently stronger</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.440" end="00:36:29.119" style="s2">than the president was 10 or 20 years</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.079" end="00:36:30.800" style="s2">ago</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.119" end="00:36:32.800" style="s2">partially this is you know just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.800" end="00:36:34.800" style="s2">the weirdness of donald trump</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.800" end="00:36:36.640" style="s2">where as long as he can use twitter and</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.800" end="00:36:39.200" style="s2">as long as twitter can&#39;t ban him</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.640" end="00:36:40.480" style="s2">he has a direct method of speaking to</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.200" end="00:36:43.280" style="s2">his followers right</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.480" end="00:36:45.040" style="s2">outside of government this was lacking i</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.280" end="00:36:47.040" style="s2">think people should understand</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.040" end="00:36:49.040" style="s2">presidents did not have the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.040" end="00:36:51.119" style="s2">speak directly to their supporters for</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.040" end="00:36:53.359" style="s2">most of the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.119" end="00:36:55.520" style="s2">right it was intermediated through media</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.359" end="00:36:57.040" style="s2">organizations</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.520" end="00:36:58.800" style="s2">so okay there are a few minor things</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.040" end="00:37:00.560" style="s2">pushing in that direction but still the</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.800" end="00:37:01.119" style="s2">disconnect between presidency and</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.560" end="00:37:04.720" style="s2">president</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.119" end="00:37:05.760" style="s2">is vast i also think that power has been</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.720" end="00:37:08.240" style="s2">accrued</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.760" end="00:37:10.079" style="s2">by the supreme court and by the u.s</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.240" end="00:37:12.560" style="s2">intelligence community at a much</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.079" end="00:37:13.440" style="s2">faster rate than the president has if</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.560" end="00:37:15.440" style="s2">you say compare</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.440" end="00:37:17.200" style="s2">the us president to the u.s intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.440" end="00:37:20.640" style="s2">community in 1950</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.200" end="00:37:22.800" style="s2">of the president is in charge by 1960</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.640" end="00:37:25.040" style="s2">it&#39;s almost certainly the agencies by</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.800" end="00:37:26.240" style="s2">1980 it&#39;s not even in competition</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.040" end="00:37:28.240" style="s2">anymore</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.240" end="00:37:29.520" style="s2">however but the 1980s the intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.240" end="00:37:33.040" style="s2">community fragments</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.520" end="00:37:35.359" style="s2">almost fractally so any say</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.040" end="00:37:37.200" style="s2">you know individual intelligence agency</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.359" end="00:37:38.880" style="s2">might end up being weaker</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.200" end="00:37:40.800" style="s2">but the intelligence community as a</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.880" end="00:37:42.800" style="s2">whole like runs the country in a</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.800" end="00:37:46.079" style="s2">relatively oligarchic fashion</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.800" end="00:37:49.119" style="s2">i think so i would say that</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.079" end="00:37:50.640" style="s2">we are sort of in the era of senatorial</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.119" end="00:37:52.560" style="s2">abuses of power</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.640" end="00:37:54.240" style="s2">there except the real senate is not</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.560" end="00:37:59.440" style="s2">congress right</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.240" end="00:37:59.440" style="s2">if we use the roman comparison thank you</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.560" end="00:38:03.599" style="s2">but we have a popular question here from</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.119" end="00:38:05.920" style="s2">shar</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.599" end="00:38:07.200" style="s2">would you like to meet yourself and ask</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.920" end="00:38:10.480" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.200" end="00:38:13.520" style="s2">sure um um hey good to see you</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.480" end="00:38:15.440" style="s2">hi chris um great talk i was</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.520" end="00:38:16.960" style="s2">i was wondering you know some people</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.440" end="00:38:19.359" style="s2">have have</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.960" end="00:38:20.400" style="s2">said that we should start cults i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.359" end="00:38:24.000" style="s2">sure if you&#39;re of the same</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.400" end="00:38:27.960" style="s2">same opinion and if so uh i guess the</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.000" end="00:38:30.640" style="s2">term cult brings to mind a certain</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.960" end="00:38:32.400" style="s2">anti-technological aesthetic something</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.640" end="00:38:33.520" style="s2">like branch dravidians or whatever or</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.400" end="00:38:36.560" style="s2">the amish</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.520" end="00:38:38.640" style="s2">um so if we do have to start cults</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.560" end="00:38:40.640" style="s2">what would be pro-technological</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.640" end="00:38:43.359" style="s2">pro-social pro-expansionary</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.640" end="00:38:44.960" style="s2">cults and what rituals can we start</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.359" end="00:38:48.160" style="s2">thanks</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.960" end="00:38:48.720" style="s2">right right um i think starting cults is</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.160" end="00:38:51.280" style="s2">difficult</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.720" end="00:38:52.880" style="s2">and i know most cults are unproductive</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.280" end="00:38:54.720" style="s2">in the sense that they</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.880" end="00:38:56.160" style="s2">are economically exploitative of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.720" end="00:38:57.680" style="s2">membership of the cult</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.160" end="00:39:00.400" style="s2">some smaller number of cults are</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.680" end="00:39:00.800" style="s2">productive it was a while ago an attempt</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.400" end="00:39:04.480" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.800" end="00:39:06.800" style="s2">you know introduce some of um</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.480" end="00:39:09.040" style="s2">cult-like characteristics to economic</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.800" end="00:39:09.040" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.200" end="00:39:12.960" style="s2">and i think that</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.520" end="00:39:19.760" style="s2">i would encourage much more the reform</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.400" end="00:39:22.960" style="s2">of cults than the creation of new cults</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.760" end="00:39:24.560" style="s2">so in other words i think being working</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.960" end="00:39:25.599" style="s2">with the framework of an existing</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.560" end="00:39:28.560" style="s2">organized religion</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.599" end="00:39:30.480" style="s2">and changing it massively probably leads</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.560" end="00:39:31.760" style="s2">to better outcomes</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.480" end="00:39:33.920" style="s2">and one of the reasons why i think it</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.760" end="00:39:34.320" style="s2">leads to better outcomes it constrains</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.920" end="00:39:37.920" style="s2">away</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.320" end="00:39:40.720" style="s2">all sorts of terrible design choices</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.920" end="00:39:42.800" style="s2">it also means that almost instantly you</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.720" end="00:39:44.880" style="s2">start with some social legitimacy rather</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.800" end="00:39:46.960" style="s2">than zero social legitimacy</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.880" end="00:39:49.839" style="s2">i think that society as a whole is a</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.960" end="00:39:51.760" style="s2">cult and cults don&#39;t like competition</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.839" end="00:39:53.359" style="s2">so as soon as you are starting a new</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.760" end="00:39:55.359" style="s2">weird strange cult</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.359" end="00:39:56.960" style="s2">that is inwardly oriented even if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.359" end="00:39:59.280" style="s2">economically productive</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.960" end="00:40:01.599" style="s2">it enters a pathological relationship</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.280" end="00:40:03.280" style="s2">with the rest of society</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.599" end="00:40:05.599" style="s2">and piercing this barrier where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.280" end="00:40:07.280" style="s2">no longer a competing organism but</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.599" end="00:40:07.839" style="s2">you&#39;re more like the mitochondria of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.280" end="00:40:09.839" style="s2">cell</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.839" end="00:40:11.839" style="s2">right like in a symbiotic relationship</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.839" end="00:40:14.560" style="s2">with the rest of the organism</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.839" end="00:40:16.560" style="s2">it&#39;s extremely difficult so it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.560" end="00:40:20.960" style="s2">me it&#39;s it&#39;s much easier</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.560" end="00:40:23.359" style="s2">to you know try to</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.960" end="00:40:24.560" style="s2">transform or splinter an existing</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.359" end="00:40:28.319" style="s2">religious group</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.560" end="00:40:30.240" style="s2">that&#39;s highly active so for example</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.319" end="00:40:32.000" style="s2">right now i&#39;m surprised and you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.240" end="00:40:34.160" style="s2">hopefully hopefully i&#39;m not seen as</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.000" end="00:40:35.440" style="s2">encouraging this i&#39;m just sociologically</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.160" end="00:40:37.280" style="s2">surprised</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.440" end="00:40:40.240" style="s2">that there haven&#39;t been more splinters</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.280" end="00:40:42.640" style="s2">off of the mormon church</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.240" end="00:40:44.880" style="s2">right it seems highly active well</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.640" end="00:40:46.880" style="s2">organized people speak foreign languages</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.880" end="00:40:49.599" style="s2">they&#39;re well off economically</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.880" end="00:40:51.040" style="s2">yet they still are definitely solidly</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.599" end="00:40:53.040" style="s2">coordinated</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.040" end="00:40:54.400" style="s2">but but it&#39;s very you know it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.040" end="00:40:55.839" style="s2">central right</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.400" end="00:40:57.920" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of unusual that there hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.839" end="00:41:02.480" style="s2">been more activity there</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.920" end="00:41:02.480" style="s2">um a different one is i think that</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.720" end="00:41:06.800" style="s2">there has not really been a proper</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.880" end="00:41:09.680" style="s2">attempt to leverage</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.800" end="00:41:11.040" style="s2">the winner takes all dynamics of online</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.680" end="00:41:14.560" style="s2">audiences</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.040" end="00:41:16.079" style="s2">with a particular religion arguably the</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.560" end="00:41:18.000" style="s2">closest thing that has happened in this</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.079" end="00:41:20.319" style="s2">space are the weird mega churches of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.000" end="00:41:22.319" style="s2">1980s and 90s but that&#39;s not internet</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.319" end="00:41:25.920" style="s2">native at all</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.319" end="00:41:28.560" style="s2">so any sort of religion which could</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.920" end="00:41:29.440" style="s2">offer people a way to start shit posting</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.560" end="00:41:31.520" style="s2">as if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.440" end="00:41:32.880" style="s2">members of that religion and then</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.520" end="00:41:35.200" style="s2">eventually buying in</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.880" end="00:41:37.359" style="s2">completely digitally and entering</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.200" end="00:41:38.800" style="s2">virtual digitalized struggle sessions</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.359" end="00:41:40.880" style="s2">oops i mean confession</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.800" end="00:41:44.480" style="s2">right it&#39;s the same thing would come to</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.880" end="00:41:46.319" style="s2">dominate society fairly quickly</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.480" end="00:41:48.319" style="s2">so maybe the joke is well maybe such a</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.319" end="00:41:48.560" style="s2">religion is emerging as just not calling</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.319" end="00:41:50.800" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.560" end="00:41:52.560" style="s2">a religion but that&#39;s that&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.800" end="00:41:54.960" style="s2">separate discussion for now</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.560" end="00:41:54.960" style="s2">so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.560" end="00:42:01.440" style="s2">great all right let me see so</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.000" end="00:42:03.920" style="s2">there&#39;s a question i&#39;m going to ask on</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.440" end="00:42:06.960" style="s2">coleman&#39;s behalf what types of</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.920" end="00:42:08.960" style="s2">power are underrated by millennials</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.960" end="00:42:11.359" style="s2">and then maybe gray also was interested</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.960" end="00:42:13.920" style="s2">in maybe tying that in</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.359" end="00:42:17.839" style="s2">to the intersection between millennial</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.920" end="00:42:17.839" style="s2">culture and a culture of victimhood</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.640" end="00:42:23.440" style="s2">well i think that you know i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.599" end="00:42:26.319" style="s2">really i don&#39;t think victimhood</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.440" end="00:42:27.520" style="s2">is chosen but it&#39;s always participated</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.319" end="00:42:30.079" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.520" end="00:42:32.000" style="s2">so i think in a way you know i think in</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.079" end="00:42:34.480" style="s2">a way</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.000" end="00:42:35.839" style="s2">the fact that millennials can bond so</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.480" end="00:42:38.560" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.839" end="00:42:40.240" style="s2">over what amounts to generational hatred</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.560" end="00:42:42.839" style="s2">suggests that they&#39;re quite comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.240" end="00:42:45.839" style="s2">with the world where they&#39;re not in</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.839" end="00:42:45.839" style="s2">charge</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.240" end="00:42:50.240" style="s2">so i think i think uh they when</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.400" end="00:42:53.440" style="s2">millennials come to be their own</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.240" end="00:42:55.520" style="s2">age group uh they will continue to</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.440" end="00:42:57.119" style="s2">firmly believe someone else is in charge</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.520" end="00:42:59.839" style="s2">even when they are in fact the person</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.119" end="00:42:59.839" style="s2">that is in charge</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.560" end="00:43:04.560" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure whether a stronger overlap</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.599" end="00:43:08.000" style="s2">can be made there</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.560" end="00:43:10.240" style="s2">like you could you could consider</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.000" end="00:43:11.440" style="s2">you know say advances in in various</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.240" end="00:43:14.640" style="s2">kinds of social</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.440" end="00:43:17.680" style="s2">norms and so on to you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.640" end="00:43:18.160" style="s2">be adding to the cult of victimhood but</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.680" end="00:43:19.359" style="s2">i really</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.160" end="00:43:22.960" style="s2">i really don&#39;t think it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.359" end="00:43:22.960" style="s2">complicated i think it&#39;s much simpler</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.720" end="00:43:28.560" style="s2">and then so uh you talked about so so</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.440" end="00:43:30.800" style="s2">connected to that</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.560" end="00:43:31.680" style="s2">so what type of power are millennials</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.800" end="00:43:34.319" style="s2">not seeing</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.680" end="00:43:35.200" style="s2">or not seeing themselves as uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.319" end="00:43:39.040" style="s2">interested in</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.200" end="00:43:42.240" style="s2">inheriting as the older generations</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.040" end="00:43:45.520" style="s2">you know pass away and kind of a new</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.240" end="00:43:45.520" style="s2">changing of the guard may happen</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.160" end="00:43:50.079" style="s2">i think that millennials don&#39;t tend to</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.920" end="00:43:52.880" style="s2">understand procedural</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.079" end="00:43:54.480" style="s2">procedural power at all for example i</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.880" end="00:43:56.720" style="s2">would expect them to</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.480" end="00:43:58.640" style="s2">regularly make uh legal mistakes that</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.720" end="00:44:01.680" style="s2">baby boomers would not make or</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.640" end="00:44:03.839" style="s2">underestimate the power of law fair uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.680" end="00:44:06.880" style="s2">so like you know legal warfare</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.839" end="00:44:08.560" style="s2">compared to uh public opinion warfare</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.880" end="00:44:10.960" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna tend to</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.560" end="00:44:12.800" style="s2">consistently overestimate the importance</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.960" end="00:44:15.280" style="s2">of public opinion pressure</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.800" end="00:44:16.400" style="s2">versus something like having the board</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.280" end="00:44:18.880" style="s2">of a company be</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.400" end="00:44:19.599" style="s2">all of your close friends and never ever</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.880" end="00:44:22.000" style="s2">putting</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.599" end="00:44:22.800" style="s2">enough people on the board to actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.000" end="00:44:24.400" style="s2">give you</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.800" end="00:44:26.480" style="s2">you know enough people so that they</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.400" end="00:44:27.440" style="s2">produce the appearance of oversight but</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.480" end="00:44:29.280" style="s2">don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.440" end="00:44:31.359" style="s2">you know don&#39;t actually exercise</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.280" end="00:44:33.200" style="s2">oversight that&#39;s not a thing that i</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.359" end="00:44:34.880" style="s2">think most millennials intuit as a</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.200" end="00:44:35.839" style="s2">viable power move and i think most</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.880" end="00:44:38.640" style="s2">people that are say</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.839" end="00:44:40.000" style="s2">at least gen x age understand it as a</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.640" end="00:44:42.000" style="s2">power move but it means</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.000" end="00:44:43.119" style="s2">like selling out man right they consider</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.000" end="00:44:44.720" style="s2">it bad</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.119" end="00:44:46.480" style="s2">uh and i think slightly older people</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.720" end="00:44:48.720" style="s2">don&#39;t even consider it bad when they</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.480" end="00:44:51.200" style="s2">discuss it privately</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.720" end="00:44:52.160" style="s2">um so procedural power either in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.200" end="00:44:55.119" style="s2">legal variant</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.160" end="00:44:56.880" style="s2">or the office politics variant another</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.119" end="00:45:00.079" style="s2">one would be</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.880" end="00:45:02.319" style="s2">i think they undervalued property it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.079" end="00:45:05.119" style="s2">little bit of a sour grape situation</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.319" end="00:45:05.760" style="s2">but they&#39;ve uh not had property for so</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.119" end="00:45:07.599" style="s2">long</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.760" end="00:45:08.960" style="s2">that they don&#39;t understand that no</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.599" end="00:45:11.200" style="s2">actually you know no</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.960" end="00:45:13.200" style="s2">actually owning owning land and</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.200" end="00:45:15.119" style="s2">especially owning housing</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.200" end="00:45:16.319" style="s2">is the way american society is</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.119" end="00:45:18.160" style="s2">structured</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.319" end="00:45:20.319" style="s2">your ticket to base to being kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.160" end="00:45:22.880" style="s2">like you know part of the welfare state</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.319" end="00:45:26.560" style="s2">i think america has a real welfare state</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.880" end="00:45:28.079" style="s2">and it&#39;s oriented towards homeowners</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.560" end="00:45:32.240" style="s2">and i think everything outside of that</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.079" end="00:45:36.880" style="s2">is like a fake welfare state</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.240" end="00:45:40.000" style="s2">cool and another one is perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.880" end="00:45:41.440" style="s2">possibly the value of being to being</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.000" end="00:45:44.480" style="s2">able to produce</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.440" end="00:45:46.880" style="s2">physical things whatever people say</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.480" end="00:45:48.319" style="s2">they want physical things and smuggling</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.880" end="00:45:50.400" style="s2">is always possible</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.319" end="00:45:52.079" style="s2">so you can always manufacture something</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.400" end="00:45:53.040" style="s2">and launder it through an intermediate</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.079" end="00:45:54.720" style="s2">organization</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.040" end="00:45:57.200" style="s2">and still take a significant cut for</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.720" end="00:45:59.760" style="s2">what you manufactured</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.200" end="00:46:00.960" style="s2">right so this this idea of doing like</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.760" end="00:46:04.240" style="s2">physical</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.960" end="00:46:06.880" style="s2">physical products producing things</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.240" end="00:46:08.720" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t land naturally right so i</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.880" end="00:46:12.079" style="s2">don&#39;t think any millennial is inspired</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.720" end="00:46:12.079" style="s2">to be an industrialist</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.680" end="00:46:17.520" style="s2">interesting thank you all right let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.760" end="00:46:20.640" style="s2">hear from anish</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.520" end="00:46:20.640" style="s2">would you like to ask your question</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.880" end="00:46:29.680" style="s2">hi am i audible uh yes</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.640" end="00:46:31.359" style="s2">okay um so</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.680" end="00:46:32.880" style="s2">the question i had and i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.359" end="00:46:36.560" style="s2">mostly read it out is</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.880" end="00:46:38.000" style="s2">um so you mentioned that um</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.560" end="00:46:39.599" style="s2">you know in the beginning that a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.000" end="00:46:42.079" style="s2">the stuff that we are dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.599" end="00:46:44.079" style="s2">is like opinion uh stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.079" end="00:46:44.880" style="s2">millennials do not seem to have a very</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.079" end="00:46:47.680" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.880" end="00:46:48.400" style="s2">sense of such of power other than that</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.680" end="00:46:51.359" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.400" end="00:46:51.839" style="s2">um it seems that the ability to create</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.359" end="00:46:53.839" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.839" end="00:46:55.760" style="s2">refi or draw boundaries around local</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.839" end="00:46:57.040" style="s2">social contexts as opposed to in a mass</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.760" end="00:47:00.400" style="s2">media context</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.040" end="00:47:00.800" style="s2">seems upstream of most of the issues</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.400" end="00:47:03.280" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.800" end="00:47:04.640" style="s2">are exercising people today um do you</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.280" end="00:47:06.560" style="s2">have any thoughts on that like will a</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.640" end="00:47:08.079" style="s2">corrective radicalism about communal</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.560" end="00:47:10.400" style="s2">self-protective norms</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.079" end="00:47:12.240" style="s2">be the next development i mean we seem</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.400" end="00:47:13.760" style="s2">to be seeing things of that kind already</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.240" end="00:47:15.359" style="s2">happening you know look at the explosion</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.760" end="00:47:18.640" style="s2">of private and curated spaces</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.359" end="00:47:20.640" style="s2">like the one we are in um and um the</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.640" end="00:47:22.079" style="s2">upsides of downsides of this</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.640" end="00:47:23.599" style="s2">further development i mean i gave an</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.079" end="00:47:24.800" style="s2">example of how this would feel like from</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.599" end="00:47:26.319" style="s2">the inside</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.800" end="00:47:27.599" style="s2">which is you know speaking about</p>

<p begin="00:47:29.040" end="00:47:32.079" style="s2">uh we don&#39;t have these norms yet but i</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.720" end="00:47:33.440" style="s2">expect there are quite a few spaces like</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.079" end="00:47:34.880" style="s2">this out there like</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.440" end="00:47:36.480" style="s2">if you speak about anything that you</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.880" end="00:47:38.319" style="s2">hear here outside</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.480" end="00:47:40.400" style="s2">we&#39;ll treat that as defection and throw</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.319" end="00:47:42.800" style="s2">you out um</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.400" end="00:47:44.000" style="s2">i think norms of that type are very weak</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.800" end="00:47:46.160" style="s2">online currently</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.000" end="00:47:48.079" style="s2">and are being actively undermined by</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.160" end="00:47:51.760" style="s2">central institutions</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.079" end="00:47:54.160" style="s2">so the concept of doxing someone that is</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.760" end="00:47:56.240" style="s2">exposing their private information</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.160" end="00:47:58.160" style="s2">for the purposes of provoking</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.240" end="00:47:58.559" style="s2">retribution against them in the physical</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.160" end="00:48:00.880" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.559" end="00:48:02.079" style="s2">right so taking an online dispute</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.880" end="00:48:05.280" style="s2">physical</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.079" end="00:48:07.119" style="s2">right that was an artifact of forum</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.280" end="00:48:09.119" style="s2">culture and blogging culture in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.119" end="00:48:10.160" style="s2">early 2000s it&#39;s not an innovation of</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.119" end="00:48:12.880" style="s2">2020</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.160" end="00:48:14.319" style="s2">in fact as a social norms against it</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.880" end="00:48:16.160" style="s2">have decayed</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.319" end="00:48:19.119" style="s2">partially encouraged by ever bolder</p>

<p begin="00:48:19.119" end="00:48:22.880" style="s2">now of course i think journalism is now</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.960" end="00:48:25.280" style="s2">weaker than ever right</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.880" end="00:48:25.920" style="s2">uh in the sense that if the new york</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.280" end="00:48:29.520" style="s2">times</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.920" end="00:48:32.640" style="s2">is trying to mess with scott</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.520" end="00:48:34.880" style="s2">of slate star codex it is because</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.640" end="00:48:37.040" style="s2">the new york times is weak enough that</p>

<p begin="00:48:37.040" end="00:48:41.280" style="s2">is uh is seen as a significant uh</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.599" end="00:48:43.200" style="s2">intellectual authority to them</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.280" end="00:48:48.800" style="s2">like this which has just been impossible</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.200" end="00:48:51.280" style="s2">in 2000 or 2005 or 2010 even</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.800" end="00:48:53.760" style="s2">but still they they can&#39;t set norms they</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.280" end="00:48:56.319" style="s2">can set what is correct or not correct</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.760" end="00:48:57.200" style="s2">and i think most people&#39;s intuitions</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.319" end="00:48:59.359" style="s2">that you could be</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.200" end="00:49:00.960" style="s2">earnest and real online have been</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.359" end="00:49:03.680" style="s2">destroyed so i feel like</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.960" end="00:49:04.720" style="s2">a precondition for building communities</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.680" end="00:49:07.119" style="s2">of trust</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.720" end="00:49:09.359" style="s2">is self-trust when you are online the</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.119" end="00:49:12.319" style="s2">idea that you could be earnest or real</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.359" end="00:49:14.160" style="s2">in a text conversation or in video i</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.319" end="00:49:16.400" style="s2">think this again is an idea that</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.160" end="00:49:18.480" style="s2">predates 2010. it</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.400" end="00:49:20.960" style="s2">comes out of a desire for authenticity</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.480" end="00:49:24.160" style="s2">online sometimes it was paired with</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.960" end="00:49:26.240" style="s2">cypherpunk-like ideologies right it came</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.160" end="00:49:28.559" style="s2">from the area era of pseudonyms</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.240" end="00:49:29.440" style="s2">and anonymity it doesn&#39;t seem like a</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.559" end="00:49:32.640" style="s2">native idea</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.440" end="00:49:34.160" style="s2">for people that you know have primarily</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.640" end="00:49:37.200" style="s2">used say tik tok</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.160" end="00:49:39.200" style="s2">or youtube or instagram for them the</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.200" end="00:49:42.720" style="s2">online spaces where you produce</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.200" end="00:49:45.280" style="s2">and project the perfect self image</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.720" end="00:49:46.160" style="s2">the perfect manufactured product for the</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.280" end="00:49:49.200" style="s2">purposes</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.160" end="00:49:49.760" style="s2">of not being ostracized and it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.200" end="00:49:52.720" style="s2">a war</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.760" end="00:49:53.520" style="s2">of all against all so if these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.720" end="00:49:55.119" style="s2">things happen</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.520" end="00:49:57.599" style="s2">i actually have a very pessimistic</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.119" end="00:49:58.160" style="s2">prediction i suspect this they might</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.599" end="00:50:00.880" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.160" end="00:50:01.920" style="s2">in uh you know these online harassment</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.880" end="00:50:03.920" style="s2">movements</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.920" end="00:50:06.240" style="s2">every now and then there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.920" end="00:50:07.599" style="s2">that you know provokes harassment online</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.240" end="00:50:09.839" style="s2">and people kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.599" end="00:50:11.119" style="s2">unify around harassment of that for a</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.839" end="00:50:14.559" style="s2">little bit</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.119" end="00:50:17.359" style="s2">so perhaps like a very gerardian dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.559" end="00:50:20.800" style="s2">but even those i think have a relatively</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.359" end="00:50:20.800" style="s2">short half-life right now</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.800" end="00:50:29.520" style="s2">all right do you think norms will get</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.319" end="00:50:31.040" style="s2">of this kind of like strong spaces with</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.520" end="00:50:31.359" style="s2">very strong boundaries around them that</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.040" end="00:50:33.520" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.359" end="00:50:34.720" style="s2">outer world doesn&#39;t even know about uh</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.520" end="00:50:35.760" style="s2">do you think these will become more</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.720" end="00:50:38.000" style="s2">prominent as</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.760" end="00:50:39.760" style="s2">time goes on as you know the oh i think</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.000" end="00:50:41.599" style="s2">i think in person meetings without</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.760" end="00:50:43.359" style="s2">phones will start to be seen as quite</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.599" end="00:50:45.440" style="s2">subversive and dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.359" end="00:50:46.880" style="s2">i think like 20 years from now there</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.440" end="00:50:48.880" style="s2">will be a report that</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.880" end="00:50:50.240" style="s2">there will be an article in a mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.880" end="00:50:52.160" style="s2">publication saying</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.240" end="00:50:54.880" style="s2">the two senators met while leaving their</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.160" end="00:50:56.160" style="s2">home phones at home</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.880" end="00:50:58.880" style="s2">and that will be like in itself</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.160" end="00:51:01.280" style="s2">considered mildly scandalous</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.880" end="00:51:02.720" style="s2">like proof that they were up to no good</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.280" end="00:51:03.680" style="s2">but i think precisely because of that</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.720" end="00:51:06.720" style="s2">the like physical</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.680" end="00:51:08.960" style="s2">in-person space will become you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.720" end="00:51:10.960" style="s2">this equivalent of the fringe space of</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.960" end="00:51:13.599" style="s2">1990s chatroom</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.960" end="00:51:14.960" style="s2">right so it&#39;s almost an inversion right</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.599" end="00:51:18.319" style="s2">nothing i write online</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.960" end="00:51:21.280" style="s2">could possibly matter nothing i write</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.319" end="00:51:22.480" style="s2">in physical space could possibly matter</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.280" end="00:51:25.200" style="s2">right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.480" end="00:51:26.160" style="s2">switched over needs space and digital</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.200" end="00:51:28.000" style="s2">space</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.160" end="00:51:29.599" style="s2">and what is the space for the marginal</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.000" end="00:51:32.800" style="s2">or for the</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.599" end="00:51:36.319" style="s2">for the uh private okay</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.800" end="00:51:39.599" style="s2">thank you</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.319" end="00:51:42.240" style="s2">great and as we&#39;re closing up</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.599" end="00:51:43.599" style="s2">here i wanted to go back to an earlier</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.240" end="00:51:44.079" style="s2">question that was a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.599" end="00:51:48.400" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.079" end="00:51:50.240" style="s2">you samo that was from angen</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.400" end="00:51:52.559" style="s2">so i don&#39;t know engine do you want to</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.240" end="00:51:53.599" style="s2">unmute oh he says he wants me to ask it</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.559" end="00:51:55.599" style="s2">on his behalf so</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.599" end="00:51:57.520" style="s2">okay here&#39;s the question who would you</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.599" end="00:51:58.240" style="s2">mo most like to interview in the world</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.520" end="00:52:01.280" style="s2">today</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.240" end="00:52:02.240" style="s2">and why and if you could interview them</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.280" end="00:52:04.640" style="s2">in private</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.240" end="00:52:07.119" style="s2">maybe without your phones uh is there a</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.640" end="00:52:08.160" style="s2">preference falsification you&#39;d most like</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.119" end="00:52:10.880" style="s2">to try</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.160" end="00:52:10.880" style="s2">to poke at</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.599" end="00:52:21.359" style="s2">well that&#39;s an interesting question um</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.760" end="00:52:24.720" style="s2">it&#39;s a long list of people i&#39;d want to</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.359" end="00:52:24.720" style="s2">interview um</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.880" end="00:52:33.680" style="s2">i think that if i could speak</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.480" end="00:52:35.359" style="s2">if i could speak chinese i think a</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.680" end="00:52:38.800" style="s2">one-hour private interview</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.359" end="00:52:41.119" style="s2">with xi would be extremely useful</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.800" end="00:52:43.040" style="s2">um i probably have a lot of fun say</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.119" end="00:52:43.520" style="s2">talking to like the vladimir putin&#39;s of</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.040" end="00:52:45.599" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.520" end="00:52:46.640" style="s2">and so on but i feel like i understand</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.599" end="00:52:48.559" style="s2">it much better</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.640" end="00:52:50.000" style="s2">and i feel like i would learn much more</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.559" end="00:52:52.480" style="s2">about chinese culture</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.000" end="00:52:53.599" style="s2">in terms of intellectuals i think there</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.480" end="00:52:55.359" style="s2">are some very</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.599" end="00:52:56.720" style="s2">there&#39;s some exceptional people active</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.359" end="00:53:01.839" style="s2">today</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.720" end="00:53:01.839" style="s2">uh but for nearly all of them i think</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.000" end="00:53:05.040" style="s2">let&#39;s put this way i think nearly every</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.000" end="00:53:07.839" style="s2">intellectual that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.040" end="00:53:09.040" style="s2">active in public right now is more in</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.839" end="00:53:11.359" style="s2">the business</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.040" end="00:53:12.880" style="s2">of participating in the discourse than</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.359" end="00:53:15.680" style="s2">shaping the discourse</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.880" end="00:53:16.000" style="s2">in a strange and very interesting way xi</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.680" end="00:53:18.240" style="s2">has</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.000" end="00:53:20.079" style="s2">more ability to shape the discourse</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.240" end="00:53:22.640" style="s2">because he&#39;s the head of state</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.079" end="00:53:24.800" style="s2">of a rising society and at a massive</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.640" end="00:53:27.359" style="s2">censorship apparatus as well</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.800" end="00:53:29.280" style="s2">on top of that than any sort of</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.359" end="00:53:31.200" style="s2">individual public voice can</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.280" end="00:53:33.040" style="s2">as far as i&#39;ve been able to tell if</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.200" end="00:53:34.240" style="s2">you&#39;re truly separate from the</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.040" end="00:53:36.079" style="s2">establishment</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.240" end="00:53:38.559" style="s2">the maximum audience you can reach is a</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.079" end="00:53:40.319" style="s2">few hundred thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.559" end="00:53:42.960" style="s2">right and that&#39;s not enough to shift</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.319" end="00:53:45.359" style="s2">society here or there so in a way</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.960" end="00:53:47.359" style="s2">the intellectuals are like less they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.359" end="00:53:50.319" style="s2">not very much the drivers of a</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.359" end="00:53:50.319" style="s2">society right now</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.280" end="00:53:55.839" style="s2">interesting and uh i guess we&#39;ll finish</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.760" end="00:53:59.040" style="s2">up with a question from rachel haywire</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.839" end="00:53:59.040" style="s2">would you like to ask your question</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.160" end="00:54:05.200" style="s2">um what we were talking about before</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.720" end="00:54:06.800" style="s2">about the gerardian scapegoating</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.200" end="00:54:09.040" style="s2">and the right having its own council</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.800" end="00:54:10.880" style="s2">culture and we&#39;re currently witnessing a</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.040" end="00:54:11.920" style="s2">time with the harper&#39;s letter et cetera</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.880" end="00:54:14.319" style="s2">et cetera all the</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.920" end="00:54:16.319" style="s2">the leftists are being cancelled um what</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.319" end="00:54:17.520" style="s2">happens when you get cancelled on the</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.319" end="00:54:21.200" style="s2">right because</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.520" end="00:54:24.720" style="s2">you&#39;re dealing with um straussians and</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.200" end="00:54:27.280" style="s2">prestigious um how would you handle that</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.720" end="00:54:27.280" style="s2">effectively</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.839" end="00:54:32.240" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s very interesting like the</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.319" end="00:54:34.000" style="s2">say the playbook for how you handle like</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.240" end="00:54:35.599" style="s2">left cancellation is is much more</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.000" end="00:54:39.760" style="s2">explored isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.599" end="00:54:43.440" style="s2">um i think with right cancellation</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.760" end="00:54:45.760" style="s2">the main effect of it is that they are</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.440" end="00:54:46.640" style="s2">very much obsessed with positional</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.760" end="00:54:50.160" style="s2">victories</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.640" end="00:54:51.280" style="s2">right so particular opportunities being</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.160" end="00:54:55.359" style="s2">denied</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.280" end="00:54:58.799" style="s2">or particular titles being taken away</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.359" end="00:55:01.040" style="s2">which means that as long as for example</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.799" end="00:55:06.160" style="s2">if they</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.040" end="00:55:07.839" style="s2">do not receive if they don&#39;t receive</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.160" end="00:55:09.680" style="s2">if they attempt to pressure someone to</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.839" end="00:55:12.480" style="s2">fire to fire</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.680" end="00:55:13.599" style="s2">an individual and the individual is not</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.480" end="00:55:15.440" style="s2">fired</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.599" end="00:55:18.079" style="s2">but the individual later mysteriously</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.440" end="00:55:20.640" style="s2">finds themselves in a new position</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.079" end="00:55:21.839" style="s2">they basically like lose motivation to</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.640" end="00:55:23.440" style="s2">pursue that target</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.839" end="00:55:25.040" style="s2">does that make sense if a person is</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.440" end="00:55:28.079" style="s2">fired or if a person is</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.040" end="00:55:30.319" style="s2">denied an application that&#39;s a win if a</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.079" end="00:55:31.680" style="s2">person is still visibly grasping for the</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.319" end="00:55:33.920" style="s2">same position</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.680" end="00:55:36.160" style="s2">they also consider that sort of a win if</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.920" end="00:55:38.160" style="s2">a person goes to a different position</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.160" end="00:55:39.839" style="s2">they don&#39;t quite know what to do with it</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.160" end="00:55:40.319" style="s2">and they start losing coherence because</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.839" end="00:55:43.520" style="s2">they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.319" end="00:55:46.559" style="s2">the the organization is very</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.520" end="00:55:48.400" style="s2">ad hoc and usually quite bounded in</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.559" end="00:55:49.599" style="s2">which industry or domain it works at</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.400" end="00:55:54.480" style="s2">they&#39;re not as good</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.599" end="00:55:57.280" style="s2">as cross cross industry or cross domain</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.480" end="00:55:59.200" style="s2">i see so go to this side or not the</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.280" end="00:56:03.839" style="s2">front door or the back door</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.200" end="00:56:03.839" style="s2">yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.240" end="00:56:07.359" style="s2">all right great so we&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.480" end="00:56:10.559" style="s2">wrapping up</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.359" end="00:56:11.599" style="s2">here um sama do you have any final</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.559" end="00:56:14.079" style="s2">thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.599" end="00:56:16.400" style="s2">that you would like to leave us with</p>

<p begin="00:56:21.119" end="00:56:27.280" style="s2">it seems to me that this</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.240" end="00:56:30.480" style="s2">transition in society right we are</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.280" end="00:56:32.160" style="s2">right now in a perfect moment for the</p>
