<p begin="00:00:38.340" end="00:00:41.879" style="s2">conversations and one with Rick Doblin</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.690" end="00:00:43.710" style="s2">will be already out by the time this is</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.879" end="00:00:45.960" style="s2">posted so people hopefully would have</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.710" end="00:00:48.570" style="s2">seen that that was quite beautiful as</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.960" end="00:00:49.739" style="s2">well now I&#39;m quite interested about what</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.570" end="00:00:52.380" style="s2">we&#39;re going to end up talking about</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.739" end="00:00:54.540" style="s2">today because Gabor I came into contact</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.380" end="00:00:57.000" style="s2">with your work I&#39;d say about four and a</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.540" end="00:01:01.290" style="s2">half years ago I found your presence</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.000" end="00:01:04.290" style="s2">immediately what interesting powerful</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.290" end="00:01:06.420" style="s2">and going over some of your stuff over</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.290" end="00:01:09.690" style="s2">the last few weeks particularly the last</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.420" end="00:01:12.330" style="s2">few days I realized how much your</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.690" end="00:01:14.729" style="s2">thoughts on addiction actually did help</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.330" end="00:01:17.250" style="s2">me conceptualize some of the things I</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.729" end="00:01:20.670" style="s2">was going through and ultimately how to</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.250" end="00:01:23.340" style="s2">move forward so it&#39;s kind of challenging</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.670" end="00:01:24.659" style="s2">always to know how to introduce a</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.340" end="00:01:27.450" style="s2">conversation with someone you&#39;ve only</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.659" end="00:01:31.080" style="s2">just met and someone you respect so much</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.450" end="00:01:32.700" style="s2">and know has so much to say and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.080" end="00:01:34.200" style="s2">a limited time frame because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.700" end="00:01:36.000" style="s2">lot we could talk about and ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.200" end="00:01:37.619" style="s2">what I&#39;d quite like to do is not only</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.000" end="00:01:42.240" style="s2">get somewhere interesting but hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.619" end="00:01:43.890" style="s2">further something you know and so given</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.240" end="00:01:49.110" style="s2">are you sure you&#39;re not putting too much</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.890" end="00:01:49.380" style="s2">pressure on yourself yes I&#39;m sure I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.110" end="00:01:52.170" style="s2">sure</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.380" end="00:01:54.590" style="s2">okay and so all I&#39;ll do is ask you</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.170" end="00:01:57.210" style="s2">gobble for people that have not been</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.590" end="00:02:01.740" style="s2">introduced to you before yeah who are</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.210" end="00:02:05.939" style="s2">you what what are you doing somebody</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.740" end="00:02:07.170" style="s2">asked me that recently and number of</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.939" end="00:02:09.479" style="s2">people have said about me as they call</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.170" end="00:02:11.190" style="s2">me uh people whisper I don&#39;t you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.479" end="00:02:14.250" style="s2">concept of the dog whisperer</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.190" end="00:02:18.480" style="s2">it&#39;s a best-selling book and in North</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.250" end="00:02:22.440" style="s2">America and somebody who trains dogs not</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.480" end="00:02:25.019" style="s2">by coercing them but some people by</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.440" end="00:02:29.400" style="s2">whispering to them no other word</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.019" end="00:02:33.030" style="s2">streaming gently and with respect and my</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.400" end="00:02:35.310" style="s2">view of human problems is that they all</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.030" end="00:02:40.380" style="s2">arise from an individual of at least</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.310" end="00:02:43.680" style="s2">they all arise from when we were</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.380" end="00:02:45.569" style="s2">children and infants when we should have</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.680" end="00:02:47.609" style="s2">been whispered to when should have been</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.569" end="00:02:53.010" style="s2">talked to gently when we should have</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.609" end="00:02:54.810" style="s2">been held in a nurturing way something</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.010" end="00:02:58.230" style="s2">interfered with our parents capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.810" end="00:03:01.380" style="s2">do that and therefore people who wounded</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.230" end="00:03:04.170" style="s2">in all those wounds and the defense</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.380" end="00:03:06.180" style="s2">against those wounds arise most of human</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.170" end="00:03:09.299" style="s2">dysfunctions most of what we call</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.180" end="00:03:12.810" style="s2">disease most are immune illness most</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.299" end="00:03:16.769" style="s2">cancer most neurological disease most</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.810" end="00:03:18.959" style="s2">depression anxiety ADHD addictions and</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.769" end="00:03:23.790" style="s2">so on and therefore if you want to guide</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.959" end="00:03:25.739" style="s2">people to healing we have to go back to</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.790" end="00:03:29.069" style="s2">those early wounds and help people</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.739" end="00:03:31.680" style="s2">understand them and and and relate to</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.069" end="00:03:35.940" style="s2">themselves in a loving compassionate way</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.680" end="00:03:38.489" style="s2">and so when I&#39;m doing my job well then</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.940" end="00:03:42.420" style="s2">I&#39;m whispering to them in that sense and</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.489" end="00:03:43.680" style="s2">and and know how to get down to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.420" end="00:03:47.849" style="s2">essence</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.680" end="00:03:51.359" style="s2">of what hurt people and even deeper to</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.849" end="00:03:54.090" style="s2">the genuine self that has always</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.359" end="00:03:57.959" style="s2">remained intact underneath all those</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.090" end="00:03:59.939" style="s2">hurts mm-hmm and so that&#39;s when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.959" end="00:04:03.060" style="s2">doing my work well that&#39;s what I&#39;m able</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.939" end="00:04:05.340" style="s2">to do that&#39;s really beautiful and I am</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.060" end="00:04:07.379" style="s2">curious to know when someone does come</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.340" end="00:04:11.340" style="s2">to you for help how do you know what to</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.379" end="00:04:13.379" style="s2">do how do you know to help them well it</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.340" end="00:04:15.780" style="s2">helps to overhear a framework and I just</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.379" end="00:04:18.750" style="s2">you know articulated the framework so</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.780" end="00:04:22.680" style="s2">now it&#39;s just a matter of asking the</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.750" end="00:04:24.000" style="s2">right questions in a way that well no</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.680" end="00:04:27.169" style="s2">that&#39;s not just a matter of asking the</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.000" end="00:04:29.669" style="s2">right questions it&#39;s it&#39;s a matter of</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.169" end="00:04:32.039" style="s2">creating a sense of safety for somebody</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.669" end="00:04:36.810" style="s2">so they can open up and answer the</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.039" end="00:04:38.580" style="s2">questions and as dr. Stephen Porges a</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.810" end="00:04:40.889" style="s2">wonderful American psychologist says</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.580" end="00:04:42.930" style="s2">safety doesn&#39;t come from a lack of</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.889" end="00:04:45.870" style="s2">threat it comes from connection</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.930" end="00:04:47.880" style="s2">what&#39;s a connection connection so safety</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.870" end="00:04:52.650" style="s2">resides in connection not in an absence</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.880" end="00:04:54.750" style="s2">of threat so it&#39;s when you get a sense</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.650" end="00:04:57.990" style="s2">of being connected with and you feel</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.750" end="00:05:03.000" style="s2">safe then you can open up and then the</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.990" end="00:05:05.270" style="s2">questions rather suggest themselves just</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.000" end="00:05:07.970" style="s2">in the course of the conversation so I</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.270" end="00:05:11.250" style="s2">can describe it but I you know I</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.970" end="00:05:13.380" style="s2">demonstrated but I could if you wanted</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.250" end="00:05:15.930" style="s2">to give me a problem I&#39;m sure you I do</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.380" end="00:05:19.699" style="s2">it but but really that&#39;s all it is is</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.930" end="00:05:23.580" style="s2">conceptually simple and practically also</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.699" end="00:05:25.289" style="s2">straightforward if you understand I</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.580" end="00:05:28.440" style="s2">think what you just said there about</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.289" end="00:05:30.479" style="s2">safety is quite interesting and how to</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.440" end="00:05:32.639" style="s2">hold someone safely</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.479" end="00:05:35.340" style="s2">I guess that&#39;s an aspect of how to hold</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.639" end="00:05:38.789" style="s2">someone with with love you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.340" end="00:05:41.000" style="s2">before how in childhood often is not so</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.789" end="00:05:47.729" style="s2">much what happens but what doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.000" end="00:05:50.279" style="s2">happen yes so when you look at</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.729" end="00:05:53.520" style="s2">people&#39;s illnesses very often you can</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.279" end="00:05:56.849" style="s2">identify specific traumas things that</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.520" end="00:05:58.830" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t have happened to them and if</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.849" end="00:06:00.539" style="s2">you want to look at the salient example</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.830" end="00:06:02.599" style="s2">of it here in the Australian setting</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.539" end="00:06:07.949" style="s2">just look at the aboriginal population</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.599" end="00:06:10.789" style="s2">here&#39;s a group that has been has been</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.949" end="00:06:13.919" style="s2">and continues to be socially abused</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.789" end="00:06:15.599" style="s2">recent reports about and if you read</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.919" end="00:06:18.029" style="s2">them but all these massacres of them</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.599" end="00:06:20.009" style="s2">that took place more than than was ever</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.029" end="00:06:22.469" style="s2">thought and more recently than I was</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.009" end="00:06:25.680" style="s2">ever thought large scale massacres of</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.469" end="00:06:28.919" style="s2">abused into the 1930s here in Australia</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.680" end="00:06:30.240" style="s2">and the average Aboriginal child I just</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.919" end="00:06:32.849" style="s2">heard a couple days ago here in</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.240" end="00:06:35.669" style="s2">Australia is a twenty four times this</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.849" end="00:06:45.169" style="s2">great risk of being incarcerated in a</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.669" end="00:06:48.029" style="s2">Caucasian show well I think we lack the</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.169" end="00:06:51.959" style="s2">appreciation of how multi-generational</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.029" end="00:06:54.839" style="s2">trauma affects the individual now it is</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.959" end="00:06:57.180" style="s2">and and and it&#39;s in its it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.839" end="00:06:59.610" style="s2">cultural and social and so then is it</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.180" end="00:07:01.680" style="s2">any surprise that those people then</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.610" end="00:07:04.439" style="s2">would have a greater need to escape from</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.680" end="00:07:09.749" style="s2">all the pain and one way to escape for</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.439" end="00:07:11.610" style="s2">example is through addictions so so so</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.749" end="00:07:14.580" style="s2">that but but on the other hand as you</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.610" end="00:07:17.159" style="s2">said it&#39;s not just bad things that</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.580" end="00:07:18.599" style="s2">happened to you that can screw things up</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.159" end="00:07:21.300" style="s2">it&#39;s also an the good things that should</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.599" end="00:07:23.879" style="s2">have happened didn&#39;t happen so for</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.300" end="00:07:25.800" style="s2">example in my case I recently read my</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.879" end="00:07:28.949" style="s2">mother&#39;s diary she kept when I was an</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.800" end="00:07:30.899" style="s2">infant and I&#39;m six months of agent and</p>

<p begin="00:07:30.899" end="00:07:35.909" style="s2">months ago I&#39;m 74 and just read it</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.639" end="00:07:38.189" style="s2">recently and she says my poor little</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.909" end="00:07:38.969" style="s2">girl she says I felt so bad for you my</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.189" end="00:07:40.949" style="s2">heart was breaking</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.969" end="00:07:42.809" style="s2">you were crying from three o&#39;clock in</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.949" end="00:07:45.449" style="s2">the morning but I couldn&#39;t figure to</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.809" end="00:07:47.719" style="s2">five o&#39;clock because the doctors forbade</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.449" end="00:07:50.189" style="s2">me to feed you except on schedule and</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.719" end="00:07:52.169" style="s2">the dogs a little been so angry with me</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.189" end="00:07:53.939" style="s2">if I pick you up and finally it caught</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.169" end="00:07:55.919" style="s2">the five I couldn&#39;t stand any more</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.939" end="00:07:57.680" style="s2">I picked you up and I fed you but don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.919" end="00:08:00.770" style="s2">think I can do that again</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.680" end="00:08:03.229" style="s2">now that&#39;s not a question of something</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.770" end="00:08:05.030" style="s2">doing bad to me that shouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.229" end="00:08:07.250" style="s2">happened that it&#39;s a good thing that</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.030" end="00:08:08.300" style="s2">should have happened now what is the six</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.250" end="00:08:10.330" style="s2">month or six please</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.300" end="00:08:14.389" style="s2">not six month old sorry six weeks old</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.330" end="00:08:16.759" style="s2">experience when the person who brought</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.389" end="00:08:18.250" style="s2">them into the world bore them for nine</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.759" end="00:08:20.990" style="s2">months</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.250" end="00:08:24.110" style="s2">he knows the source of physical and</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.990" end="00:08:26.930" style="s2">emotional nourishment deprives her the</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.110" end="00:08:28.490" style="s2">presume of contact and he cries for an</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.930" end="00:08:30.830" style="s2">hour and a half what&#39;s the experience</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.490" end="00:08:33.050" style="s2">with that infant you know and such is</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.830" end="00:08:34.510" style="s2">the question of the good thing is I</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.050" end="00:08:37.430" style="s2">should have happened not happening and</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.510" end="00:08:40.419" style="s2">in this culture we see this all the time</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.430" end="00:08:43.580" style="s2">and and this isn&#39;t a part of loving</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.419" end="00:08:45.800" style="s2">parents my mother loved me there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.580" end="00:08:47.600" style="s2">question though it&#39;s not about the lack</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.800" end="00:08:51.589" style="s2">of love in this situation it&#39;s about the</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.600" end="00:08:53.510" style="s2">misapplication of love you know when it</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.589" end="00:08:55.850" style="s2">comes to parents loving their kids I</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.510" end="00:08:57.170" style="s2">even parents who hit their kids and</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.850" end="00:08:59.000" style="s2">abuse them they still love their kids</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.170" end="00:09:00.380" style="s2">for the most part they&#39;re just doing</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.000" end="00:09:02.209" style="s2">what they know how to do they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.380" end="00:09:04.220" style="s2">doing what was done to them they just</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.209" end="00:09:06.110" style="s2">acting out their own pain and anger and</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.220" end="00:09:09.650" style="s2">frustration but it&#39;s not that they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.110" end="00:09:11.870" style="s2">love their kids so the issue of love is</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.650" end="00:09:13.940" style="s2">interesting one there&#39;s there&#39;s the love</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.870" end="00:09:15.770" style="s2">that the parent might feel then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.940" end="00:09:17.209" style="s2">a love that the child might experience</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.770" end="00:09:20.150" style="s2">and the two are not the same thing at</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.209" end="00:09:23.029" style="s2">all because the child is being hit does</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.150" end="00:09:24.589" style="s2">not experience look my inner child was</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.029" end="00:09:26.690" style="s2">not picked up and they&#39;re crying does</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.589" end="00:09:29.950" style="s2">not experience love but that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.690" end="00:09:35.089" style="s2">negate the parents love hmm</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.950" end="00:09:36.560" style="s2">so love is a two-way street and in some</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.089" end="00:09:37.880" style="s2">sense it&#39;s more connected than that of</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.560" end="00:09:39.350" style="s2">course because we&#39;re always embedded in</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.880" end="00:09:43.100" style="s2">environments and we&#39;re embedded over</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.350" end="00:09:48.970" style="s2">long periods of time and but let&#39;s take</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.100" end="00:09:51.560" style="s2">two individuals take a child and parents</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.970" end="00:09:55.220" style="s2">let&#39;s say that the child is older in</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.560" end="00:09:57.950" style="s2">their 30s and parent is 5060 or what</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.220" end="00:09:59.810" style="s2">have you there&#39;s a sense in which both</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.950" end="00:10:03.430" style="s2">people and become responsible for that</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.810" end="00:10:05.959" style="s2">shared connection right and so you have</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.430" end="00:10:07.700" style="s2">let&#39;s say the dynamic is one person</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.959" end="00:10:09.980" style="s2">searching for something that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.700" end="00:10:11.990" style="s2">there when they were younger and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.980" end="00:10:15.290" style="s2">adult is trying to give that now and</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.990" end="00:10:17.420" style="s2">maybe maybe there&#39;s something pure in</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.290" end="00:10:19.940" style="s2">what they&#39;re doing now but because the</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.420" end="00:10:22.310" style="s2">perception has been twisted that</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.940" end="00:10:23.870" style="s2">connection cannot be made and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.310" end="00:10:26.120" style="s2">a sense in which you&#39;re also dealing</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.870" end="00:10:28.370" style="s2">with well of course you&#39;re dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.120" end="00:10:30.230" style="s2">childhood trauma and other forms of</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.370" end="00:10:32.630" style="s2">trauma perhaps but you&#39;re also dealing</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.230" end="00:10:34.190" style="s2">with the projection of the child and a</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.630" end="00:10:37.190" style="s2">misperception of what&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.190" end="00:10:39.890" style="s2">occurring and I&#39;m looking here for a</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.190" end="00:10:44.270" style="s2">segue actually although we can stay on</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.890" end="00:10:49.880" style="s2">this towards some other phenomenon we</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.270" end="00:10:53.240" style="s2">see happen in the world where people can</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.880" end="00:10:55.430" style="s2">be quite notable forces for benefit for</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.240" end="00:10:57.260" style="s2">so many hundreds of thousands of people</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.430" end="00:11:00.380" style="s2">now in a figure like Jordan Pederson for</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.260" end="00:11:05.839" style="s2">instance and then simultaneously a</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.380" end="00:11:09.529" style="s2">beacon of for many a beacon of hate this</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.839" end="00:11:10.790" style="s2">is very confusing so how it is that is</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.529" end="00:11:12.579" style="s2">that example playing out there with</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.790" end="00:11:14.839" style="s2">Jordan Pearson in anyway endemic of</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.579" end="00:11:17.570" style="s2">misperceptions well so first of all it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.839" end="00:11:19.850" style="s2">it&#39;s astonishing the first part of your</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.570" end="00:11:21.770" style="s2">comments because my eldest son and I are</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.850" end="00:11:23.810" style="s2">just writing a book called hello again</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.770" end="00:11:25.459" style="s2">and a fresh start for our children and</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.810" end="00:11:28.370" style="s2">their parents now a beautiful and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.459" end="00:11:32.200" style="s2">precisely about the difficulty of</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.370" end="00:11:33.850" style="s2">negotiating a relationship in adulthood</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.200" end="00:11:34.990" style="s2">and of course it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.850" end="00:11:37.650" style="s2">relationship because in the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.990" end="00:11:40.000" style="s2">the child&#39;s brain is barely even online</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.650" end="00:11:42.550" style="s2">and the parent is already fully</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.000" end="00:11:44.160" style="s2">developed mm-hmm and in the chávez</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.550" end="00:11:46.450" style="s2">utterly dependent the parent is</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.160" end="00:11:49.210" style="s2">providing all the care so there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.450" end="00:11:50.890" style="s2">utterly asymmetrical relationship and</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.210" end="00:11:52.720" style="s2">then how you make that into an equal</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.890" end="00:11:54.490" style="s2">symmetric relationship what you become</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.720" end="00:11:56.710" style="s2">an adult but you&#39;ve been programmed in a</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.490" end="00:11:58.030" style="s2">certain way you know that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.710" end="00:11:59.920" style="s2">interesting question and that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.030" end="00:12:03.220" style="s2">it&#39;s a workshop that my son I actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.920" end="00:12:05.170" style="s2">do and in fact on YouTube you can find</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.220" end="00:12:08.770" style="s2">our names Daniel and grab MIT and watch</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.170" end="00:12:12.310" style="s2">how we talk about it beautiful but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.770" end="00:12:16.420" style="s2">working on that now so that&#39;s one issue</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.310" end="00:12:20.050" style="s2">but now we said what Jordan Peterson is</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.420" end="00:12:22.720" style="s2">teaching comes down to individual</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.050" end="00:12:24.810" style="s2">responsibility then it is responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.720" end="00:12:29.380" style="s2">is important you should all be</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.810" end="00:12:32.440" style="s2">responsible for our lives but is the</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.380" end="00:12:35.620" style="s2">aforesaid Aboriginal child who&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.440" end="00:12:40.030" style="s2">historically traumatized and continues</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.620" end="00:12:42.460" style="s2">to be discriminated against socially and</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.030" end="00:12:44.610" style="s2">his chances of being incarcerated are so</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.460" end="00:12:44.610" style="s2">much greater</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.390" end="00:12:52.320" style="s2">can we just expect him to be as</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.580" end="00:12:56.830" style="s2">responsible as a privileged white male</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.320" end="00:12:59.080" style="s2">brought up under very comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.830" end="00:13:00.940" style="s2">circumstances or or do we need to</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.080" end="00:13:03.460" style="s2">actually look at the social basis of</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.940" end="00:13:05.170" style="s2">responsibility coming out to birth we</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.460" end="00:13:10.480" style="s2">can do both but we can&#39;t ignore either</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.170" end="00:13:13.240" style="s2">one I agree yeah so and he does that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.480" end="00:13:15.100" style="s2">the first point the second point is is</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.240" end="00:13:19.510" style="s2">essential messages yeah you gotta take</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.100" end="00:13:21.010" style="s2">responsibility but then what is it we</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.510" end="00:13:22.060" style="s2">don&#39;t look at what is it that makes it</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.010" end="00:13:24.490" style="s2">difficult people who take responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.060" end="00:13:27.580" style="s2">and what makes it people the bigger</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.490" end="00:13:30.460" style="s2">responsibility is lack of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.580" end="00:13:32.200" style="s2">lack of awareness and and and in the way</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.460" end="00:13:35.890" style="s2">of awareness in the way of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.200" end="00:13:40.540" style="s2">is precisely trauma and the third point</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.890" end="00:13:42.250" style="s2">about him is that his advocacy is for</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.540" end="00:13:43.730" style="s2">parents to bring up kids that fit into</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.250" end="00:13:46.220" style="s2">society</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.730" end="00:13:49.850" style="s2">and so now in Suriname become social</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.220" end="00:13:54.170" style="s2">agents of conformity basically in his</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.850" end="00:13:56.209" style="s2">teaching and and basically you better</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.170" end="00:13:57.500" style="s2">make your kids into people that you will</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.209" end="00:13:59.000" style="s2">like because otherwise society won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.500" end="00:13:59.870" style="s2">like them well that&#39;s one of your</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.000" end="00:14:02.180" style="s2">chartering</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.870" end="00:14:04.220" style="s2">in other words children is that the</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.180" end="00:14:06.649" style="s2">essential child is that the purpose of</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.220" end="00:14:09.199" style="s2">child rearing is to help people develop</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.649" end="00:14:10.850" style="s2">the individual potential for freedom</p>

<p begin="00:15:52.850" end="00:15:55.880" style="s2">point of view too I think what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.990" end="00:15:57.920" style="s2">doing is he&#39;s meeting an unmet need in</p>

<p begin="00:16:14.540" end="00:16:20.980" style="s2">do need it but a lot of other people in</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.510" end="00:16:24.550" style="s2">society can get very stuck in the</p>

<p begin="00:16:36.760" end="00:16:41.649" style="s2">even change it I think is it definitely</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.339" end="00:16:44.410" style="s2">underlying your work with trauma and</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.649" end="00:16:47.620" style="s2">with and with addiction both having</p>

<p begin="00:16:55.300" end="00:16:59.560" style="s2">finds themselves relapsing going back to</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.279" end="00:17:02.769" style="s2">the drug again again despite the best</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.560" end="00:17:05.049" style="s2">intentions yeah well so let&#39;s grant</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.769" end="00:17:08.199" style="s2">which I&#39;m free to do that</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.049" end="00:17:09.720" style="s2">Peterson is good intentions he has good</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.199" end="00:17:13.780" style="s2">intentions he wants to liberate people</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.720" end="00:17:15.760" style="s2">so do i the question is how best to go</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.780" end="00:17:19.660" style="s2">about it and what&#39;s in the ways of</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.760" end="00:17:23.470" style="s2">people&#39;s capacity to be free now there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.660" end="00:17:25.290" style="s2">a book written in the 1980s by us with</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.470" end="00:17:28.410" style="s2">psychotherapists called Allison other</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.290" end="00:17:31.809" style="s2">entitled the drum of the gifted child</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.410" end="00:17:34.240" style="s2">which is the first one the first seminal</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.809" end="00:17:35.710" style="s2">book son impacts of childhood trauma the</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.240" end="00:17:39.040" style="s2">German title of the book the original</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.710" end="00:17:41.080" style="s2">title was prisoners of childhood I like</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.040" end="00:17:44.200" style="s2">that name yeah it&#39;s a much better name</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.080" end="00:17:46.030" style="s2">and and by gifted child but it means she</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.200" end="00:17:48.250" style="s2">means the sensitive child but regardless</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.030" end="00:17:50.470" style="s2">the prisoners a childhood is a much more</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.250" end="00:17:53.679" style="s2">accurate title and fundamentally we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.470" end="00:17:54.490" style="s2">all prisoners of childhood and looking</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.679" end="00:17:58.660" style="s2">at myself</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.490" end="00:18:00.640" style="s2">and looking at Peterson looking at</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.660" end="00:18:02.710" style="s2">almost anybody in this society we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.640" end="00:18:06.309" style="s2">prisoners of our chocolates we are very</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.710" end="00:18:09.090" style="s2">much programmed by what happens to us</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.309" end="00:18:11.830" style="s2">early in life and and and and and</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.090" end="00:18:16.150" style="s2">basically so much over as I said earlier</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.830" end="00:18:18.309" style="s2">our dysfunctions are arise out of coping</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.150" end="00:18:20.410" style="s2">mechanisms to deal with what happens to</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.309" end="00:18:22.510" style="s2">us so addiction for example is not a</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.410" end="00:18:25.169" style="s2">moral choice just to say to an addict</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.510" end="00:18:27.580" style="s2">take responsibility well that&#39;s nice</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.169" end="00:18:29.740" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting how that discussion is</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.580" end="00:18:33.220" style="s2">evolved we went from there&#39;s a society</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.740" end="00:18:34.750" style="s2">believing that yes addicts either were</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.220" end="00:18:36.880" style="s2">just making a choice</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.750" end="00:18:40.270" style="s2">choice again again and therefore lack of</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.880" end="00:18:41.560" style="s2">compassion was expected then we sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.270" end="00:18:44.980" style="s2">had the conception that addiction is a</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.560" end="00:18:47.980" style="s2">brain disorder it&#39;s a chemical imbalance</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.980" end="00:18:49.780" style="s2">a disease right well and then so I just</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.980" end="00:18:52.300" style="s2">spoke here in Melbourne two days ago to</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.780" end="00:18:55.750" style="s2">a group of judges and lawyers and</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.300" end="00:18:57.940" style="s2">advocates and court workers on addiction</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.750" end="00:19:00.370" style="s2">and and and the legal approach to</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.940" end="00:19:02.320" style="s2">addiction is based on the absolute</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.370" end="00:19:04.840" style="s2">misperception that it&#39;s just some kind</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.320" end="00:19:06.790" style="s2">of a change choice so people are making</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.840" end="00:19:08.800" style="s2">a negative choice at least our society</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.790" end="00:19:12.130" style="s2">that choice that society regards</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.800" end="00:19:13.720" style="s2">negative then we punish them for it and</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.130" end="00:19:16.720" style="s2">that&#39;s the whole legal system is based</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.720" end="00:19:18.340" style="s2">on that utterly unfounded idea that</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.720" end="00:19:19.930" style="s2">addiction is a choice and the addict</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.340" end="00:19:22.570" style="s2">should just take responsibility for it</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.930" end="00:19:24.400" style="s2">now yes we would like the addict to take</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.570" end="00:19:27.130" style="s2">responsibility but let&#39;s ask the</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.400" end="00:19:28.420" style="s2">question what&#39;s in no way of that and if</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.130" end="00:19:31.540" style="s2">we actually recognize that all</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.420" end="00:19:33.550" style="s2">addictions or coping mechanisms like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.540" end="00:19:35.110" style="s2">sure everybody in this room has said</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.550" end="00:19:37.720" style="s2">some addiction to something or there is</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.110" end="00:19:41.680" style="s2">some time some behavior that they craved</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.720" end="00:19:44.260" style="s2">and we derive pleasure from temporarily</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.680" end="00:19:47.380" style="s2">suffer negative consequences as result</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.260" end="00:19:50.230" style="s2">of but couldn&#39;t give it up i&#39;ve surely</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.380" end="00:19:53.710" style="s2">had those behaviors but if you ask</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.230" end="00:19:54.880" style="s2">somebody i have you - absolutely okay</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.710" end="00:19:57.790" style="s2">well let me ask you this question each</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.880" end="00:19:59.800" style="s2">of you okay not what the addiction was -</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.790" end="00:20:01.330" style="s2">not when not for how long but what did</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.800" end="00:20:05.310" style="s2">it give you what did you like about it</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.330" end="00:20:05.310" style="s2">in a short term</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.190" end="00:20:11.409" style="s2">I liked that I could pull off becoming</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.440" end="00:20:14.259" style="s2">who I needed to be and who I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.409" end="00:20:16.750" style="s2">be you didn&#39;t wake up one morning saying</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.259" end="00:20:18.549" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna do something to put off</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.750" end="00:20:19.899" style="s2">becoming that&#39;s an analytical thing I</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.549" end="00:20:23.919" style="s2">don&#39;t know what you got in the immediate</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.899" end="00:20:26.549" style="s2">sense well in the immediate sense it was</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.919" end="00:20:30.250" style="s2">participation in a short-term</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.549" end="00:20:32.620" style="s2">competitive engaging place of world</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.250" end="00:20:34.840" style="s2">competition or hierarchy that was at the</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.620" end="00:20:36.519" style="s2">expense of my longer term gain I was</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.840" end="00:20:38.950" style="s2">quite conscious of that for many years</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.519" end="00:20:43.149" style="s2">doing it okay but what you got from it</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.950" end="00:20:45.850" style="s2">was engagement yes and some meaning yes</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.149" end="00:20:46.090" style="s2">and participation right yes okay very</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.850" end="00:20:50.169" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.090" end="00:20:55.289" style="s2">and yourself I would say meaning you got</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.169" end="00:20:59.769" style="s2">meaning meaning and I guess a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.289" end="00:21:00.820" style="s2">meaning and purpose so meaning is</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.769" end="00:21:03.639" style="s2">important to both of you</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.820" end="00:21:05.139" style="s2">hmm known is important to both of you</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.639" end="00:21:07.419" style="s2">it&#39;s important to every human being</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.139" end="00:21:09.759" style="s2">everyone you know and then the question</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.419" end="00:21:11.860" style="s2">is why was meaning lacking in your life</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.759" end="00:21:13.750" style="s2">that you had to engage in some addictive</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.860" end="00:21:16.509" style="s2">behavior to derive a sense of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.750" end="00:21:18.190" style="s2">and that&#39;s what Toronto comes in so what</p>

<p begin="00:22:12.190" end="00:22:19.950" style="s2">responsibility is absolutely wrapped</p>

<p begin="00:25:32.470" end="00:25:38.139" style="s2">to responsibility though let&#39;s look at</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.049" end="00:25:40.000" style="s2">that word a little bit because you may</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.139" end="00:25:41.860" style="s2">say the word I may say the word official</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.000" end="00:25:44.769" style="s2">and we may not mean the same thing by it</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.860" end="00:25:46.990" style="s2">so very often a nothing you saying is</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.769" end="00:25:48.159" style="s2">but it was you know in employing the</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.990" end="00:25:50.500" style="s2">word responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.159" end="00:25:52.809" style="s2">people often mean who is guilty it was</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.500" end="00:25:55.450" style="s2">to be blamed was at fault right so I</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.809" end="00:25:57.309" style="s2">just throw that one out it is not part</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.450" end="00:25:59.919" style="s2">of this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.309" end="00:26:02.919" style="s2">so they she was not who&#39;s guilty because</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.919" end="00:26:04.179" style="s2">in my world I don&#39;t deal in guilt very</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.919" end="00:26:07.690" style="s2">much I just want to look at what</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.179" end="00:26:10.179" style="s2">happened and even evil is a concept that</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.690" end="00:26:12.850" style="s2">I would I know that&#39;s Chuck in a little</p>

<p begin="00:26:12.850" end="00:26:21.220" style="s2">evil things but I don&#39;t think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.299" end="00:26:24.570" style="s2">evil as such but but in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.220" end="00:26:28.509" style="s2">responsibility let&#39;s call it response</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.570" end="00:26:30.490" style="s2">ability the ability to respond agency</p>

<p begin="00:27:40.660" end="00:27:44.680" style="s2">bigger because it all depends on who you</p>

<p begin="00:27:44.680" end="00:27:53.980" style="s2">issue is but I think we would all agree</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.290" end="00:27:58.450" style="s2">on is that the challenge is how to help</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.980" end="00:28:00.100" style="s2">people move towards responsibility from</p>

<p begin="00:28:02.200" end="00:28:05.740" style="s2">that automatic reactivity to where</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.390" end="00:28:07.810" style="s2">there&#39;s really a gap between the</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.740" end="00:28:09.670" style="s2">stimulus and their response and in that</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.810" end="00:28:10.960" style="s2">gap they can find their freedom that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.670" end="00:28:12.550" style="s2">the real question that&#39;s the line</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.960" end="00:28:14.290" style="s2">between chaos and order that&#39;s I mean</p>

<p begin="00:28:14.290" end="00:28:20.590" style="s2">conceptual thinking is can be bridged</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.930" end="00:28:23.140" style="s2">here but I guess what I swear here there</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.590" end="00:28:27.250" style="s2">is the way that we view the world is the</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.140" end="00:28:28.960" style="s2">world that we live in though well the</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.250" end="00:28:31.420" style="s2">Buddha said that the Buddha said 25</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.960" end="00:28:34.030" style="s2">years ago the very first sentence in the</p>

<p begin="00:28:40.780" end="00:28:43.660" style="s2">they basically took our thoughts and our</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.460" end="00:28:45.310" style="s2">minds they would create the world that</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.660" end="00:28:47.110" style="s2">we live in so if I believe that the</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.310" end="00:28:49.090" style="s2">world is a horrible place I live in a</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.110" end="00:28:51.550" style="s2">very different world then if I believe</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.090" end="00:28:52.960" style="s2">there was a benign place and I&#39;ll behave</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.550" end="00:28:55.030" style="s2">very differently and I&#39;d be a very</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.960" end="00:28:56.710" style="s2">different person it so happens that the</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.030" end="00:28:58.780" style="s2">person who said that the world is a</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.710" end="00:29:01.480" style="s2">horrible place in so many words is the</p>

<p begin="00:29:01.480" end="00:29:04.690" style="s2">what the Buddha didn&#39;t say and I so he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.460" end="00:29:07.770" style="s2">doing his best to create a horrible</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.690" end="00:29:10.240" style="s2">world exist what he lives in now the</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.770" end="00:29:13.060" style="s2">missing piece here though in the bush</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.240" end="00:29:15.070" style="s2">perspective is that before with our</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.060" end="00:29:16.210" style="s2">minds we create the world the world</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.070" end="00:29:18.429" style="s2">creates our minds</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.210" end="00:29:21.249" style="s2">so we create the world with the minds</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.429" end="00:29:24.399" style="s2">that the world program into us at every</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.249" end="00:29:26.919" style="s2">age and the more formative experience</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.399" end="00:29:28.720" style="s2">the more restricted you you the world is</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.919" end="00:29:33.429" style="s2">and our more limited your view of</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.720" end="00:29:35.499" style="s2">yourself is and the more fearful your</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.429" end="00:29:36.669" style="s2">view of other people might be so that</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.499" end="00:29:38.830" style="s2">means now you&#39;re living it from that</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.669" end="00:29:42.879" style="s2">place and a question is how do we</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.830" end="00:29:45.220" style="s2">restore how do we overcome the</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.879" end="00:29:48.009" style="s2">constriction of trauma and restore</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.220" end="00:29:50.710" style="s2">people to true Liberty which is their</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.009" end="00:29:52.869" style="s2">birthright and their true nature that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.710" end="00:29:54.580" style="s2">the best question and I think that takes</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.869" end="00:29:57.549" style="s2">a lot more than just telling somebody to</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.580" end="00:30:00.549" style="s2">take responsibility yeah I think so too</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.549" end="00:30:02.559" style="s2">just a brief neurological fact is we</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.549" end="00:30:04.210" style="s2">know that through brain imaging the</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.559" end="00:30:06.399" style="s2">traumatized person that they&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.210" end="00:30:10.049" style="s2">areas of the sense of self are so quiet</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.399" end="00:30:13.809" style="s2">so dim my an fMRI they really have lost</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.049" end="00:30:15.850" style="s2">their you know that the our sense of a</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.809" end="00:30:17.350" style="s2">sense of self our sense of what we what</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.850" end="00:30:19.570" style="s2">we love what is meaningful to us where</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.350" end="00:30:21.970" style="s2">we want to go our direction that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.570" end="00:30:24.129" style="s2">and not only that the same imaging</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.970" end="00:30:25.930" style="s2">studies you look at the brain you see</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.129" end="00:30:27.509" style="s2">that when people are overcome by</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.930" end="00:30:31.480" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.509" end="00:30:33.460" style="s2">powerful emotions the part of the brain</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.480" end="00:30:35.200" style="s2">that exercises responsibility and choice</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.460" end="00:30:39.700" style="s2">the mid frontal cortex actually goes</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.200" end="00:30:41.889" style="s2">offline fraidy she as well see yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.700" end="00:30:44.110" style="s2">that&#39;s right absolutely yeah yeah HD is</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.889" end="00:30:45.429" style="s2">just one manifestation of trauma as far</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.110" end="00:30:49.619" style="s2">as I&#39;m concerned having been diagnosed</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.429" end="00:30:51.610" style="s2">with it myself and and so neurologically</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.619" end="00:30:54.639" style="s2">you can say to somebody take</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.610" end="00:30:56.139" style="s2">responsibility but what if their funnel</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.639" end="00:30:59.889" style="s2">cortex is offline because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.139" end="00:31:02.679" style="s2">overwhelmed by cortisol yeah so again</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.889" end="00:31:05.730" style="s2">you know it&#39;s legitimate that we should</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.679" end="00:31:08.080" style="s2">support people taking responsibility but</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.730" end="00:31:09.610" style="s2">it&#39;s important to ask what&#39;s in a way of</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.080" end="00:31:11.289" style="s2">that and how we help them get there</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.610" end="00:31:14.710" style="s2">let&#39;s look at that&#39;s a real question and</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.289" end="00:31:16.720" style="s2">you have spent a lot of time with these</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.710" end="00:31:19.690" style="s2">patients so that with addicted patients</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.720" end="00:31:22.749" style="s2">in your work well with myself and with</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.690" end="00:31:24.399" style="s2">yourself I find it quite interesting</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.749" end="00:31:27.309" style="s2">that you have explored the shadow side</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.399" end="00:31:29.490" style="s2">of humanity and therefore know so well</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.309" end="00:31:31.860" style="s2">how desperately we need</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.490" end="00:31:36.690" style="s2">tools of transformation yeah and how</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.860" end="00:31:39.090" style="s2">many people are stuck and could be</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.690" end="00:31:41.640" style="s2">liberated if there was another way so I</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.090" end="00:31:44.670" style="s2">find it quite striking then how how you</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.640" end="00:31:46.740" style="s2">discovered psychedelics which are tools</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.670" end="00:31:48.600" style="s2">for transformation and can yeah there</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.740" end="00:31:50.280" style="s2">are monitors is the in the right</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.600" end="00:31:52.740" style="s2">settings liberate us and a rigidity of</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.280" end="00:31:56.940" style="s2">our thoughts for sure</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.740" end="00:32:00.810" style="s2">now of course spiritual modalities the</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.940" end="00:32:04.470" style="s2">pathways of all kinds from way before</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.810" end="00:32:05.280" style="s2">the Buddha to the person time have asked</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.470" end="00:32:08.460" style="s2">the same question</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.280" end="00:32:13.170" style="s2">ancient Greeks know and and Greece</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.460" end="00:32:17.370" style="s2">Pythagoras Socrates so these questions</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.170" end="00:32:19.950" style="s2">have been asked for a long time but</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.370" end="00:32:23.070" style="s2">certainly one powerful and in my</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.950" end="00:32:26.610" style="s2">experience effective pathway for a lot</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.070" end="00:32:30.120" style="s2">of people not for everybody which is me</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.610" end="00:32:33.480" style="s2">is the route of psychedelics precisely</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.120" end="00:32:36.120" style="s2">because they get underneath the defenses</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.480" end="00:32:38.250" style="s2">that we built up in childhood and they</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.120" end="00:32:42.060" style="s2">get to the core of the issues that</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.250" end="00:32:43.410" style="s2">motivate us but they also can take us</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.060" end="00:32:44.760" style="s2">down to that real stuff that we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.410" end="00:32:46.560" style="s2">talking about people who actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.760" end="00:32:50.760" style="s2">experienced their real selves they</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.560" end="00:32:52.560" style="s2">reveal the true being being absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.760" end="00:32:54.690" style="s2">that can happen to people which doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.560" end="00:32:56.760" style="s2">mean that having something being</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.690" end="00:32:59.520" style="s2">revealed to you therefore you can not</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.760" end="00:33:00.990" style="s2">embody it so there&#39;s a you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.520" end="00:33:04.200" style="s2">gonna have these great experiences and</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.990" end="00:33:05.970" style="s2">and and as my wife could tell you go</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.200" end="00:33:08.010" style="s2">back to being the same jerk that you</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.970" end="00:33:11.220" style="s2">were before the experience unless there</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.010" end="00:33:13.770" style="s2">is unless there&#39;s integration unless the</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.220" end="00:33:16.290" style="s2">deep immersion honest as a practice</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.770" end="00:33:19.140" style="s2">around it but as a way of revealing</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.290" end="00:33:23.370" style="s2">these truths and and and helping people</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.140" end="00:33:24.660" style="s2">transform realistic edicts or in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.370" end="00:33:26.880" style="s2">right context and you have to emphasize</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.660" end="00:33:29.520" style="s2">that under the right guidance in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.880" end="00:33:33.060" style="s2">right context right leadership right</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.520" end="00:33:36.210" style="s2">counseling right integration they can be</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.060" end="00:33:38.250" style="s2">extraordinarily effective mmm so they</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.210" end="00:33:42.330" style="s2">said a few things their environment our</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.250" end="00:33:42.850" style="s2">preparation intention then integration</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.330" end="00:33:46.030" style="s2">these are</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.850" end="00:33:49.240" style="s2">all vitally important to the outcome and</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.030" end="00:33:51.790" style="s2">how changed you are from a psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.240" end="00:33:54.610" style="s2">experience how how much you do recover</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.790" end="00:33:57.340" style="s2">from of yourself and one thing that</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.610" end="00:34:00.010" style="s2">really helped me at your workshop at</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.340" end="00:34:02.110" style="s2">cyclic science 2017 was the focus you</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.010" end="00:34:04.300" style="s2">put on the creation of an intention and</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.110" end="00:34:05.860" style="s2">recently be going quite deep in Buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.300" end="00:34:07.780" style="s2">practice and I&#39;ve been discovering that</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.860" end="00:34:09.460" style="s2">the same thing applies for what is</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.780" end="00:34:11.290" style="s2">practice you&#39;re encouraged to stay feel</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.460" end="00:34:14.710" style="s2">made it your intention to meditate each</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.290" end="00:34:17.350" style="s2">time you meditate so quite I&#39;d love for</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.710" end="00:34:18.640" style="s2">you to share some of the thoughts and</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.350" end="00:34:20.700" style="s2">some of the reflections you would</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.640" end="00:34:22.930" style="s2">consider when recommending someone</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.700" end="00:34:25.990" style="s2">create an intention for a psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.930" end="00:34:27.850" style="s2">experience so if you look at the root of</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.990" end="00:34:30.070" style="s2">the word intention it comes in Latin</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.850" end="00:34:32.290" style="s2">were a 10 year which is to stretch or</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.070" end="00:34:33.190" style="s2">tener at the stretch so intention is</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.290" end="00:34:36.220" style="s2">something that you want to stretch</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.190" end="00:34:39.820" style="s2">towards internally but you want to move</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.220" end="00:34:42.040" style="s2">towards like an agency it&#39;s like exactly</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.820" end="00:34:44.290" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s right yeah that&#39;s cool</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.040" end="00:34:48.250" style="s2">that&#39;s right so when you want to suck it</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.290" end="00:34:51.910" style="s2">like an experience you can just I just</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.250" end="00:34:55.140" style="s2">want the trip season colors yeah see</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.910" end="00:34:59.080" style="s2">some nice colors and interesting animals</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.140" end="00:35:00.640" style="s2">so that&#39;s people do or you can have an</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.080" end="00:35:03.970" style="s2">intention that&#39;s related to your</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.640" end="00:35:07.150" style="s2">personal development now somebody might</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.970" end="00:35:09.160" style="s2">go into the ceremony want to get to know</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.150" end="00:35:11.620" style="s2">their fear show me my fear really get to</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.160" end="00:35:13.750" style="s2">teach me about my fear or teach me about</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.620" end="00:35:17.500" style="s2">love or teach me about show me my power</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.750" end="00:35:19.360" style="s2">or help me understand my childhood or</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.500" end="00:35:23.920" style="s2">whatever the intention isn&#39;t and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.360" end="00:35:25.240" style="s2">not when I work with people it&#39;s that we</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.920" end="00:35:27.370" style="s2">don&#39;t set a general intention for the</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.240" end="00:35:30.160" style="s2">whole group you know people identify</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.370" end="00:35:34.510" style="s2">their intention individually each for</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.160" end="00:35:36.460" style="s2">themselves and the intention is not like</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.510" end="00:35:39.820" style="s2">a weight that you carry on your neck</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.460" end="00:35:42.190" style="s2">that has to burden you it&#39;s an anchor</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.820" end="00:35:44.800" style="s2">though that you can keep keeps that</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.190" end="00:35:46.450" style="s2">keeps you moving in a certain range and</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.800" end="00:35:47.860" style="s2">you keep coming back to it because</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.450" end="00:35:50.200" style="s2">throughout the ceremony you make of all</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.860" end="00:35:51.880" style="s2">these different states and then you want</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.200" end="00:35:54.160" style="s2">to come back to your intention yes the</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.880" end="00:35:55.670" style="s2">intention without expectation intention</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.160" end="00:35:59.750" style="s2">without expectation with</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.670" end="00:36:02.660" style="s2">rigid attachment to it yes I quite liked</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.750" end="00:36:04.700" style="s2">I think you described five traits of a</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.660" end="00:36:08.000" style="s2">good story from Chekhov do you remember</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.700" end="00:36:13.400" style="s2">some of those traits yes they talked</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.000" end="00:36:15.290" style="s2">about that and and and quite possibly if</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.400" end="00:36:17.630" style="s2">I looked on my cell phone I would find</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.290" end="00:36:19.040" style="s2">it but I&#39;m not sure trouble is I give</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.630" end="00:36:21.589" style="s2">these great quotes but I don&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.040" end="00:36:27.290" style="s2">that that&#39;s okay I guess when I guess</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.589" end="00:36:30.020" style="s2">some maybe we should for four minutes we</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.290" end="00:36:32.510" style="s2">have four minutes interesting just begun</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.020" end="00:36:34.490" style="s2">yeah it feels like it it&#39;s quite a bit</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.510" end="00:36:36.260" style="s2">to say because it seems to me like and</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.490" end="00:36:38.030" style="s2">just to tie the conversation back to</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.260" end="00:36:40.880" style="s2">Jordan Peterson here and we&#39;ve also been</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.030" end="00:36:43.280" style="s2">talking about agency and we&#39;ve sort of</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.880" end="00:36:45.440" style="s2">separated that from a negative sense of</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.280" end="00:36:50.410" style="s2">responsibility that can that can hold</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.440" end="00:36:52.790" style="s2">you back it seems to me like there&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.410" end="00:36:56.720" style="s2">an image that flashed into my mind</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.790" end="00:36:59.030" style="s2">really is the similarities between</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.720" end="00:37:00.770" style="s2">between the two of you but in the same</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.030" end="00:37:03.230" style="s2">way that you know you&#39;re looking at one</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.770" end="00:37:05.630" style="s2">coin with two sides right and that might</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.230" end="00:37:11.299" style="s2">be a bit too harsh right no no no that I</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.630" end="00:37:13.819" style="s2">mean so what is certainly true I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.299" end="00:37:16.160" style="s2">Peterson is accurately identified is</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.819" end="00:37:18.319" style="s2">that we live in a society that deprives</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.160" end="00:37:19.940" style="s2">people of meaning now whether he would</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.319" end="00:37:21.920" style="s2">say that society is doing that or not</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.940" end="00:37:24.230" style="s2">but that&#39;s what he&#39;s speaking to and</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.920" end="00:37:26.839" style="s2">also doesn&#39;t allow us to connect to our</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.230" end="00:37:28.819" style="s2">needs or even recognize human needs</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.839" end="00:37:31.970" style="s2">that&#39;s right yet we&#39;re here having this</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.819" end="00:37:34.430" style="s2">conversation you know we can we can</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.970" end="00:37:36.049" style="s2">recognize our needs not I know I know I</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.430" end="00:37:39.250" style="s2">know some people I know some people have</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.049" end="00:37:42.890" style="s2">have a horribly horribly impoverished</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.250" end="00:37:45.760" style="s2">set of opportunities that are that are</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.890" end="00:37:48.619" style="s2">that that we should have nothing but</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.760" end="00:37:51.650" style="s2">understanding and compassion for when as</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.619" end="00:37:53.690" style="s2">children they have to undergo certain</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.650" end="00:37:56.900" style="s2">behaviors that and prevent them but no</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.690" end="00:37:59.270" style="s2">no but not only that if you recognize</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.900" end="00:38:01.160" style="s2">that much then the question becomes what</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.270" end="00:38:03.530" style="s2">are gonna do a better society that keeps</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.160" end="00:38:05.000" style="s2">large numbers of people that way do we</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.530" end="00:38:06.190" style="s2">just make it into an individual</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.000" end="00:38:08.220" style="s2">responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.190" end="00:38:11.200" style="s2">do we say we as a society have</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.220" end="00:38:13.750" style="s2">responsibility to do something to alter</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.200" end="00:38:17.440" style="s2">those conditions well I I agree with you</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.750" end="00:38:18.880" style="s2">but you know what what Jordan Pederson</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.440" end="00:38:20.290" style="s2">is calling for and what many people</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.880" end="00:38:22.510" style="s2">before him of call for these are not</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.290" end="00:38:24.930" style="s2">unique ideas so Jordan of course is that</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.510" end="00:38:27.430" style="s2">the individuals proper role should be</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.930" end="00:38:29.380" style="s2">towards you know in orienting towards</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.430" end="00:38:31.270" style="s2">the health of the society towards the</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.380" end="00:38:33.490" style="s2">differentiation out there into the</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.270" end="00:38:34.780" style="s2">unknown source and back with something</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.490" end="00:38:41.320" style="s2">that will give you a personal question</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.780" end="00:38:43.410" style="s2">okay so it&#39;s a one-year-old I was nearly</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.320" end="00:38:46.420" style="s2">taken to Auschwitz in two until another</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.410" end="00:38:51.190" style="s2">that was those the actual effects on my</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.420" end="00:38:52.630" style="s2">life nearly it didn&#39;t quite happen what</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.190" end="00:38:55.690" style="s2">responsibilities would you like me have</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.630" end="00:38:57.550" style="s2">taken for that when I was a year old no</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.690" end="00:39:00.340" style="s2">I&#39;m not going at things that way I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.550" end="00:39:02.680" style="s2">more just coming from the perspective</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.340" end="00:39:06.760" style="s2">that it&#39;s no but I&#39;m asking what would</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.680" end="00:39:08.560" style="s2">you have advocated and advocated for you</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.760" end="00:39:10.750" style="s2">as a one-year-old well III don&#39;t what</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.560" end="00:39:13.300" style="s2">would you as a kid that a conscious</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.750" end="00:39:17.160" style="s2">person and I had all the should do in</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.300" end="00:39:19.600" style="s2">the world about something like that</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.160" end="00:39:22.360" style="s2">we just make it a matter of personal</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.600" end="00:39:24.580" style="s2">responsibility or do we say there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.360" end="00:39:26.380" style="s2">something really really wrong here with</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.580" end="00:39:28.270" style="s2">a society that would want to throw a</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.380" end="00:39:31.180" style="s2">one-year-old into another I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.270" end="00:39:33.010" style="s2">you have choice but to do both well we</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.180" end="00:39:35.410" style="s2">have to recognize that a lot more that</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.010" end="00:39:37.630" style="s2">were not just individuals of course and</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.410" end="00:39:39.100" style="s2">that and everything that happens it</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.630" end="00:39:42.010" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have to be as dire and as</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.100" end="00:39:44.800" style="s2">dramatic as the story of my infancy but</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.010" end="00:39:49.660" style="s2">I&#39;m saying is that individuals develop</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.800" end="00:39:52.990" style="s2">in the social context if if as is the</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.660" end="00:39:54.730" style="s2">case a black American woman has a</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.990" end="00:39:57.040" style="s2">greater risk of asthma the more</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.730" end="00:39:59.680" style="s2">expensive racism she experiences and</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.040" end="00:40:01.780" style="s2">that&#39;s just a scientific fact and I can</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.680" end="00:40:05.670" style="s2">even show you the biology of why that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.780" end="00:40:09.070" style="s2">the case then is her asthma simply her</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.670" end="00:40:11.620" style="s2">responsibility was it is it also a</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.070" end="00:40:13.810" style="s2">manifestation of a social malaise that</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.620" end="00:40:16.090" style="s2">were all responsible for no I think you</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.810" end="00:40:18.820" style="s2">and I would agree that it&#39;s both I agree</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.090" end="00:40:19.780" style="s2">with you and things too is my history of</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.820" end="00:40:21.430" style="s2">sexual trauma</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.780" end="00:40:23.470" style="s2">a responsibility of mine only the</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.430" end="00:40:26.770" style="s2">perpetrator or in the environment in</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.470" end="00:40:30.820" style="s2">which such considerations of women and</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.770" end="00:40:33.670" style="s2">sexuality have been brought up in of</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.820" end="00:40:36.490" style="s2">course I mean no yes moved in absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.670" end="00:40:39.660" style="s2">so so we are tight for time then are we</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.490" end="00:40:42.010" style="s2">I use I guess I think I could bridge</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.660" end="00:40:44.290" style="s2">that&#39;s another ten minutes and then I</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.010" end="00:40:45.850" style="s2">would happily do another what how is to</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.290" end="00:40:47.380" style="s2">do here this is too much fun he&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.850" end="00:40:58.600" style="s2">spend our time arguing about how we</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.380" end="00:41:01.330" style="s2">agree you think you know between perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.600" end="00:41:04.570" style="s2">all of us and Jordan Peterson which i</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.330" end="00:41:06.130" style="s2">think is something it does what people</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.570" end="00:41:08.830" style="s2">resonate with and it reminds me of</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.130" end="00:41:10.390" style="s2">something you said in realms of hungry</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.830" end="00:41:12.880" style="s2">ghosts when he went to Alcoholics</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.390" end="00:41:15.820" style="s2">Anonymous for the first time and you had</p>

<p begin="00:41:20.260" end="00:41:24.010" style="s2">mum was quite religious and you yourself</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.880" end="00:41:25.920" style="s2">said that you felt having known your</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.010" end="00:41:28.180" style="s2">family&#39;s experiences how could there be</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.920" end="00:41:30.460" style="s2">well could there be a god that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.180" end="00:41:32.560" style="s2">good all-knowing and all-powerful I mean</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.460" end="00:41:33.910" style="s2">if he was all good and all-knowing you</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.560" end="00:41:36.010" style="s2">couldn&#39;t be powerful otherwise you would</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.910" end="00:41:37.450" style="s2">have stopped this so that that</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.010" end="00:41:39.610" style="s2">simplistic idea of God</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.450" end="00:41:43.030" style="s2">I just never bought in and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.610" end="00:41:45.460" style="s2">people did not resonate with that and</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.030" end="00:41:50.020" style="s2">also understanding of science and how</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.460" end="00:41:52.360" style="s2">our story lines about God in in in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.020" end="00:41:53.920" style="s2">West are these books kind of falling</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.360" end="00:41:58.300" style="s2">apart in there</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.920" end="00:42:01.000" style="s2">empirical evidence that&#39;s one kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.300" end="00:42:03.880" style="s2">spirituality this the storyline and this</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.000" end="00:42:06.310" style="s2">die stick type Garbett you spoke a bit</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.880" end="00:42:08.410" style="s2">of another kind of spirituality going to</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.310" end="00:42:10.420" style="s2">your face other hand I&#39;m meeting</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.410" end="00:42:13.570" style="s2">something lines of maybe you can share a</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.420" end="00:42:15.820" style="s2">sense of well I haven&#39;t read my book for</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.570" end="00:42:18.720" style="s2">us I&#39;m quite well might ever said but I</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.820" end="00:42:21.730" style="s2">can tell you what I would say yeah is</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.720" end="00:42:25.660" style="s2">spirituality is part of our nature in</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.730" end="00:42:31.320" style="s2">the North American native Aboriginal</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.660" end="00:42:34.570" style="s2">concept of human beings human life</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.320" end="00:42:36.640" style="s2">unfolds in four quadrants the physical</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.570" end="00:42:39.940" style="s2">which is the body the mental the ideas</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.640" end="00:42:41.500" style="s2">the emotional and the spiritual and if</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.940" end="00:42:42.760" style="s2">there&#39;s not a balance within those four</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.500" end="00:42:44.920" style="s2">quadrants we have some degree of</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.760" end="00:42:47.050" style="s2">dysfunction and the more imbalance there</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.920" end="00:42:50.140" style="s2">is the more dysfunction is so I think we</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.050" end="00:42:54.430" style="s2">are special creatures of which are these</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.140" end="00:42:57.460" style="s2">of God or one manifestation but but but</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.430" end="00:42:59.290" style="s2">really it has to do with the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.460" end="00:43:02.050" style="s2">we actually are part of creation and</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.290" end="00:43:03.940" style="s2">that&#39;s not hyperbole or a metaphor we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.050" end="00:43:06.579" style="s2">actually a part of creation every</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.940" end="00:43:07.329" style="s2">particle in us that&#39;s in us has always</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.579" end="00:43:10.150" style="s2">been here</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.329" end="00:43:11.890" style="s2">yes Big Bang I mean we all come from the</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.150" end="00:43:14.440" style="s2">same matter so for all our differences</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.890" end="00:43:16.359" style="s2">in arguments and hatreds and conflicts</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.440" end="00:43:18.240" style="s2">and so on we&#39;re all the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.359" end="00:43:22.180" style="s2">the subject is also the observer</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.240" end="00:43:25.690" style="s2">absolutely and so that sense of unity</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.180" end="00:43:29.349" style="s2">and connection and oneness and that the</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.690" end="00:43:31.599" style="s2">individual ego is simply a in a sense an</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.349" end="00:43:33.520" style="s2">illusion and you certainly get that in a</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.599" end="00:43:35.349" style="s2">psychedelic experience or even in a</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.520" end="00:43:39.730" style="s2">powerful breathing exercise you can get</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.349" end="00:43:42.730" style="s2">put an illusion Diego is underneath it</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.730" end="00:43:45.810" style="s2">all and substitute subsuming Yisrael</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.730" end="00:43:48.730" style="s2">unity well that&#39;s just indisputable fact</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.810" end="00:43:51.490" style="s2">no I&#39;m not indisputable because the ego</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.730" end="00:43:55.210" style="s2">can dispute everything but it is a fact</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.490" end="00:43:57.460" style="s2">and and so specially for me this is not</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.210" end="00:44:01.119" style="s2">exhaust itself in the idea of a religion</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.460" end="00:44:06.640" style="s2">or a god or set of practices but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.119" end="00:44:09.430" style="s2">actually that our longing and our</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.640" end="00:44:11.109" style="s2">finding of the unity yeah I wanna bring</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.430" end="00:44:13.300" style="s2">up also the word you said creativity</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.109" end="00:44:15.400" style="s2">yeah and I want to share the etymology</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.300" end="00:44:17.349" style="s2">of a word now since I know to see you I</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.400" end="00:44:19.450" style="s2">really appreciate but you do that and I</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.349" end="00:44:21.819" style="s2">like it too so the word creativity comes</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.450" end="00:44:25.869" style="s2">from to have grown</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.819" end="00:44:28.749" style="s2">yes grown so your growth is a process</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.869" end="00:44:31.839" style="s2">that you engage with a process of</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.749" end="00:44:33.640" style="s2">transformation and so I guess what the</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.839" end="00:44:36.910" style="s2">other element in my sense of</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.640" end="00:44:40.239" style="s2">spirituality is engaging in a process of</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.910" end="00:44:41.380" style="s2">transformation and that can be I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.239" end="00:44:43.289" style="s2">the line that I was thinking of before</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.380" end="00:44:45.699" style="s2">your book was something long lines of</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.289" end="00:44:51.130" style="s2">creating within yourself whatever you</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.699" end="00:44:54.579" style="s2">perceive to be God like well the Bible</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.130" end="00:44:57.849" style="s2">doesn&#39;t say by accident that were</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.579" end="00:45:00.910" style="s2">created in God&#39;s image and and so in</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.849" end="00:45:04.839" style="s2">that sense that God is the creator and</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.910" end="00:45:09.009" style="s2">so not since so are we and I didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.839" end="00:45:13.630" style="s2">that source of the word but I can see</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.009" end="00:45:15.640" style="s2">why it would be compelling to look at it</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.630" end="00:45:16.959" style="s2">that way yeah I guess I could cite me I</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.640" end="00:45:19.029" style="s2">think you&#39;re probably all familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.959" end="00:45:21.489" style="s2">the fact that psychedelics also enhance</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.029" end="00:45:23.859" style="s2">creativity in fact I guess what coming</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.489" end="00:45:25.930" style="s2">out of trauma is coming out of addiction</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.859" end="00:45:27.819" style="s2">it requires a great sense of well</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.930" end="00:45:29.109" style="s2">careful careful about that one because</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.819" end="00:45:30.670" style="s2">there&#39;s been a study that says the</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.109" end="00:45:32.949" style="s2">second alikes don&#39;t enhance creativity</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.670" end="00:45:33.449" style="s2">that people think that it does but it</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.949" end="00:45:36.249" style="s2">doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.449" end="00:45:37.630" style="s2">depends which metric as to ISM can</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.249" end="00:45:39.219" style="s2">there&#39;s divergent thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.630" end="00:45:40.449" style="s2">convergent thinking both being really</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.219" end="00:45:41.890" style="s2">important parts of the creative process</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.449" end="00:45:44.259" style="s2">this was done with ayahuasca</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.890" end="00:45:46.239" style="s2">it we found that it increased divergent</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.259" end="00:45:48.759" style="s2">thinking which is divergent thinking</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.239" end="00:45:52.690" style="s2">means way better thinking is generation</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.759" end="00:45:56.589" style="s2">of many new novel ideas it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.690" end="00:45:58.449" style="s2">brainstorming it&#39;s coming up with as</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.589" end="00:45:59.650" style="s2">many possible solutions whereas</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.449" end="00:46:02.440" style="s2">convergent thinking as being is</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.650" end="00:46:05.339" style="s2">selecting one I see</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.440" end="00:46:07.839" style="s2">and moving forward with it in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.339" end="00:46:09.160" style="s2">personality we know that divergent</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.839" end="00:46:11.890" style="s2">thinking is correlated to having</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.160" end="00:46:13.930" style="s2">openness high openness to experience we</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.890" end="00:46:15.729" style="s2">also know that convergent thinking</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.930" end="00:46:17.680" style="s2">actually tends to rely not so much on</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.729" end="00:46:19.690" style="s2">personality but more on logic and</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.680" end="00:46:21.430" style="s2">reasoning so it makes sense then</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.690" end="00:46:23.199" style="s2">psychedelics would increase divergent</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.430" end="00:46:26.589" style="s2">thinking but not really have an effect</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.199" end="00:46:30.880" style="s2">on convergent yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.589" end="00:46:32.619" style="s2">well it&#39;s interesting that so we have a</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.880" end="00:46:33.969" style="s2">choice to make now because I could</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.619" end="00:46:34.840" style="s2">either reset the camera and we could do</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.969" end="00:46:36.400" style="s2">a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.840" end="00:46:38.020" style="s2">it could be time to wrap up I&#39;m afraid</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.400" end="00:46:39.430" style="s2">of thunder it&#39;s time to wrap up I have</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.020" end="00:46:41.860" style="s2">an engagement that much as I like to</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.430" end="00:46:43.330" style="s2">continue well beautiful some other time</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.860" end="00:46:45.160" style="s2">beautiful let me just say one final</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.330" end="00:46:46.870" style="s2">thing which is just that even with the</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.160" end="00:46:51.340" style="s2">discussion of spirituality at the end</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.870" end="00:46:53.830" style="s2">there and even with alluding to the</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.340" end="00:46:56.170" style="s2">the fact of our experience that the ego</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.830" end="00:46:58.000" style="s2">can dissolve and calls for some people</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.170" end="00:46:59.770" style="s2">to name it illusionary nevertheless</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.000" end="00:47:02.380" style="s2">we&#39;re still talking about a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.770" end="00:47:04.570" style="s2">agency towards the self and slightly and</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.380" end="00:47:08.220" style="s2">so you can move forward or move away</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.570" end="00:47:11.320" style="s2">from you can bury your head or you can</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.220" end="00:47:14.550" style="s2">be with it and move towards it right and</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.320" end="00:47:17.650" style="s2">for me it&#39;s it&#39;s that fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.550" end="00:47:19.540" style="s2">spiritual reality of our experience that</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.650" end="00:47:22.870" style="s2">is a core part of the responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.540" end="00:47:25.870" style="s2">message and it&#39;s for that one reason</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.870" end="00:47:28.960" style="s2">amongst many that Jordans work in</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.870" end="00:47:31.060" style="s2">providing people a toolkit at different</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.960" end="00:47:33.190" style="s2">level of analysis in which to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.060" end="00:47:36.460" style="s2">their agency in their life towards the</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.190" end="00:47:38.140" style="s2">better is having a positive effect so</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.460" end="00:47:40.570" style="s2">even as a bridge there in the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.140" end="00:47:42.040" style="s2">this video look I&#39;m not sure if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.570" end="00:47:44.440" style="s2">gonna still again everything you just</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.040" end="00:47:45.850" style="s2">said but what I see is that this</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.440" end="00:47:49.000" style="s2">particular guy has had quite an effect</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.850" end="00:47:53.350" style="s2">on you and you find something enlivening</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.000" end="00:47:54.850" style="s2">his message more power to you I again</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.350" end="00:47:57.810" style="s2">would be much more interested in</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.850" end="00:48:00.430" style="s2">somebody bears their heads as you put it</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.810" end="00:48:03.640" style="s2">I&#39;d be much disinterested in judging</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.430" end="00:48:05.830" style="s2">them for it as in asking why and and and</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.640" end="00:48:08.080" style="s2">and and and what is it that in their</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.830" end="00:48:09.940" style="s2">experience makes them so afraid and how</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.080" end="00:48:12.730" style="s2">can we help them lift their heads again</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.940" end="00:48:15.400" style="s2">rather than just to issue an injunction</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.730" end="00:48:19.020" style="s2">that they should take responsibility so</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.400" end="00:48:23.500" style="s2">the variance in the question of why and</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.020" end="00:48:26.950" style="s2">so this is my method is always is never</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.500" end="00:48:28.420" style="s2">to give prescriptions I I would not</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.950" end="00:48:30.640" style="s2">write a book called the twelve rules for</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.420" end="00:48:32.470" style="s2">life to prescribe people I should live</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.640" end="00:48:35.160" style="s2">their lives I&#39;d be much more interested</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.470" end="00:48:37.630" style="s2">in inquiry what is it that&#39;s in the way</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.160" end="00:48:39.850" style="s2">curiosity well I I&#39;m with you on that</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.630" end="00:48:41.320" style="s2">one and I think it&#39;s a cycle anyway and</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.850" end="00:48:44.020" style="s2">there&#39;s so much more to talk about um</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.320" end="00:48:45.760" style="s2">one little quick question is what I like</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.020" end="00:48:48.880" style="s2">to ask at the end is if you could share</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.760" end="00:48:50.500" style="s2">one one meme out with the world that</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.880" end="00:48:50.800" style="s2">would spread through humanity what would</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.500" end="00:48:52.570" style="s2">it be</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.800" end="00:48:54.410" style="s2">could be the sentence could be even a</p>

<p begin="00:48:54.410" end="00:49:00.320" style="s2">well that&#39;s it&#39;s quite thematic for in</p>

<p begin="00:49:00.320" end="00:49:05.210" style="s2">it&#39;s a cliche but it&#39;s also the greatest</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.570" end="00:49:08.720" style="s2">cliche there is he says the unexamined</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.210" end="00:49:11.480" style="s2">life is not worth living and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.720" end="00:49:14.630" style="s2">question of really exam really inquiring</p>
