<p begin="00:00:16.305" end="00:00:19.295" style="s2">We&#39;re going to leap out of the psycoanalytic</p>

<p begin="00:00:20.965" end="00:00:21.965" style="s2">now.</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.425" end="00:00:25.685" style="s2">and start talking about a form of</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.785" end="00:00:28.815" style="s2">approach to personality and its transformations</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.815" end="00:00:31.745" style="s2">that&#39;s predicated on</p>

<p begin="00:00:36.665" end="00:00:39.855" style="s2">And...it&#39;s a bit tricky to navigate this because...</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.735" end="00:00:43.885" style="s2">it requires the adoption of a different frame</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.885" end="00:00:45.165" style="s2">of mind and, of course,</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.165" end="00:00:48.215" style="s2">that&#39;s the case with all the theorists that we&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.215" end="00:00:49.215" style="s2">discussing.</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.865" end="00:00:50.865" style="s2">Uh...</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.325" end="00:00:57.685" style="s2">Phenomenology probably had its most</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.055" end="00:00:59.055" style="s2">thorough</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.005" end="00:01:01.325" style="s2">explication</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.735" end="00:01:04.545" style="s2">in the philosophy of</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.955" end="00:01:07.275" style="s2">Martin Heidegger.</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.465" end="00:01:11.595" style="s2">And Heidegger was actually trying to</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.105" end="00:01:15.505" style="s2">reconstruct western philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.875" end="00:01:17.325" style="s2">from the bottom up.</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.555" end="00:01:19.975" style="s2">He tought that</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.925" end="00:01:23.835" style="s2">we had been pursuing an improper</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.835" end="00:01:26.635" style="s2">pathway  conceptually really ever since the time of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.635" end="00:01:27.955" style="s2">Ancient Greeks.</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.405" end="00:01:35.875" style="s2">Back around the turn of the century</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.880" end="00:01:38.100" style="s2">-- the previous century, that&#39;s from the 19th</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.100" end="00:01:39.620" style="s2">to the 20th century --</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.095" end="00:01:44.025" style="s2">a new form of geometry was invented</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.025" end="00:01:47.085" style="s2">and that geometry was predicated on different axioms</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.085" end="00:01:49.775" style="s2">than Euclidian geometry. Now,</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.780" end="00:01:52.260" style="s2">people had thought for thousand of years that</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.340" end="00:01:55.400" style="s2">the world was properly described by Euclidian geometry.</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.405" end="00:01:56.405" style="s2">and, you know,</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.900" end="00:01:59.480" style="s2">when you employ a system like</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.480" end="00:02:02.160" style="s2">Euclidian geometry you have...there&#39;s axioms that you have to</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.160" end="00:02:04.940" style="s2">accept and they&#39;re like the rules of the game and, once you accept</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.940" end="00:02:07.300" style="s2">the axioms then you can go ahead and play the game.</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.175" end="00:02:11.565" style="s2">But there are other forms of geometry invented</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.695" end="00:02:14.765" style="s2">and...in the...in the later part of the..</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.155" end="00:02:18.195" style="s2">19th century and it turned out that  those</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.195" end="00:02:21.085" style="s2">forms with different axioms actually described the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.505" end="00:02:24.445" style="s2">better than the Euclidian forms, sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.445" end="00:02:26.055" style="s2">the transformation from Newton</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.475" end="00:02:29.075" style="s2">to Einstein...this was the..</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.585" end="00:02:32.015" style="s2">transformation from Euclide to, say,</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.015" end="00:02:34.945" style="s2">-- I think I&quot;ve got his name right -- Rie...Riemannn, R, I, E, M,</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.945" end="00:02:38.065" style="s2">A, N, N., who developed a new form of geometry and turned out to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.065" end="00:02:41.055" style="s2">just the geometry that Einstein needed when he was putting his</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.055" end="00:02:44.185" style="s2">theories forward. And, the reason I&#39;m teling you that is because</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.320" end="00:02:49.140" style="s2">you can think of systems that have different axioms as...</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.180" end="00:02:50.640" style="s2">as different tools</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.395" end="00:02:53.775" style="s2">Same idea that Piaget was trying to express</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.775" end="00:02:56.805" style="s2">when he talked about how children&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.805" end="00:02:59.685" style="s2">cognitive representations underwent</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.905" end="00:03:03.905" style="s2">stage transformations so that they were starting to apply</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.905" end="00:03:06.415" style="s2">new principles. Not only a new way</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.415" end="00:03:08.645" style="s2">of looking at the world but they were</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.645" end="00:03:12.340" style="s2">fundamentally retooling their presumptions about how the world operated.</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.340" end="00:03:14.465" style="s2">And Heidegger tried to do the same</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.465" end="00:03:17.365" style="s2">thing with philosophy. And so...</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.505" end="00:03:21.375" style="s2">And it&#39;s tricky to figure out exactly what he was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.375" end="00:03:24.225" style="s2">but I&#39;ll give it a shot and then, we can move</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.225" end="00:03:25.525" style="s2">forward with Rogers</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.275" end="00:03:27.275" style="s2">So...</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.425" end="00:03:30.565" style="s2">Since the dawn of the scientific world and, likely, before</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.565" end="00:03:33.135" style="s2">that, we have tended to believe</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.135" end="00:03:35.975" style="s2">that we are subjects in a world of objects.</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.545" end="00:03:38.225" style="s2">And that &#39;s obvioulsy a</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.225" end="00:03:41.155" style="s2">very useful way to view the world and you can</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.155" end="00:03:44.105" style="s2">tell that because, formalizing that in the form of</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.105" end="00:03:47.005" style="s2">science, has enabled us to extend</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.005" end="00:03:48.805" style="s2">control over the world</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.395" end="00:03:52.185" style="s2">in ways that we were not able to before.</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.745" end="00:03:55.345" style="s2">Uh...To formulate the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.345" end="00:03:58.215" style="s2">an objective truth has been an extraordinarily useful maneuver</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.215" end="00:04:01.085" style="s2">and so, the idea, roughly, is that</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.925" end="00:04:04.415" style="s2">everyone&#39;s perceptions can be contaminated by</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.415" end="00:04:07.695" style="s2">their own biases and their own fantasies, that subjective</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.695" end="00:04:11.195" style="s2">biases and fantasies and you can overcome that by</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.335" end="00:04:13.845" style="s2">stringently specifying</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.845" end="00:04:16.335" style="s2">the conditions under which an observation takes place</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.335" end="00:04:18.635" style="s2">-- so that would be an experimental method --</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.340" end="00:04:21.940" style="s2">Having multiple people  view the consequences</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.940" end="00:04:25.440" style="s2">separately, have them detail out what the consequences are</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.440" end="00:04:28.140" style="s2">and then look for commonalities across them. And, you think, well,</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.140" end="00:04:30.920" style="s2">the commonalities across a set of observations</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.925" end="00:04:33.895" style="s2">constitute a description of the objective world.</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.175" end="00:04:36.595" style="s2">And that&#39;s been insanely powerful.</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.055" end="00:04:39.995" style="s2">..uh....crazily powerful. I mean that&#39;s not all there is</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.995" end="00:04:42.705" style="s2">to the scientific method but</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.705" end="00:04:43.785" style="s2">it&#39;s a big part of it.</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.155" end="00:04:46.155" style="s2">Now...</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.480" end="00:04:48.700" style="s2">there is an emergent problem with that</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.920" end="00:04:49.920" style="s2">perhaps,</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.900" end="00:04:53.360" style="s2">It&#39;s complicated but one of the emergent problem</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.360" end="00:04:54.380" style="s2">with that is...</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.180" end="00:04:57.320" style="s2">maybe, a consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.320" end="00:05:00.400" style="s2">stripping the subjectivity out of the world</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.600" end="00:05:01.600" style="s2">So...</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.900" end="00:05:05.020" style="s2">What science does is..consider</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.060" end="00:05:08.120" style="s2">anything subjective as a form of bias or</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.120" end="00:05:11.020" style="s2">error in the observation and then, get rid of it and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.140" end="00:05:13.080" style="s2">what you&#39;re left with, when you...</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.800" end="00:05:16.740" style="s2">formulate the scientific world, is a world that&#39;s stripped of</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.745" end="00:05:19.095" style="s2">subjectivity. Now, the problem with that</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.095" end="00:05:21.325" style="s2">is that you&#39;re a subject and so, when you strip</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.325" end="00:05:24.235" style="s2">the world of its subjectivity, that sort of leaves you</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.240" end="00:05:27.460" style="s2">isolated, like an isolated being</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.460" end="00:05:30.355" style="s2">with no necessary connections to</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.360" end="00:05:32.780" style="s2">objective reality, in the midst of a set of</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.780" end="00:05:34.320" style="s2">impersonal facts.</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.200" end="00:05:38.600" style="s2">And, that seems to have psychological consequences</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.600" end="00:05:41.060" style="s2">and the psychological consequences</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.060" end="00:05:43.000" style="s2">are that, well, for example,</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.355" end="00:05:46.345" style="s2">I think it&#39;s easier to develop a nihilistic sense</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.345" end="00:05:49.145" style="s2">of being, for example, if you believe that the</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.145" end="00:05:51.875" style="s2">world is nothing but objects and that you&#39;re,...</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.085" end="00:05:55.825" style="s2">fundamentally, an object among many</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.825" end="00:05:58.325" style="s2">and not a particularly important one, at that.</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.785" end="00:06:02.795" style="s2">So...there are psychological</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.795" end="00:06:04.715" style="s2">consequences to adopting the</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.465" end="00:06:07.245" style="s2">scientific worldview.</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.800" end="00:06:09.760" style="s2">Prior to the emergence of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.760" end="00:06:12.480" style="s2">scientific worldview, people were more embedded in what</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.480" end="00:06:15.720" style="s2">you might think about as a mythological landscape, you know, where</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.385" end="00:06:19.225" style="s2">every element of being had its place in something that</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.225" end="00:06:22.605" style="s2">approximated a master plan or, at least, a meaningful plan.</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.605" end="00:06:25.160" style="s2">And so...the idea of ...</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.160" end="00:06:28.240" style="s2">the meaningfulness of life was not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.240" end="00:06:30.720" style="s2">such a pressing intellectual concern.</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.925" end="00:06:35.925" style="s2">And then...</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.625" end="00:06:39.120" style="s2">well, and so, we don&#39;t know the full extent of that</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.565" end="00:06:40.065" style="s2">...I mean...</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.065" end="00:06:42.160" style="s2">I&#39;ve talked to you a little bit about Nietzsche&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.160" end="00:06:45.020" style="s2">idea that&#39;s  expressed at the end of the 19th century about</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.340" end="00:06:48.100" style="s2">the death of God and his prognostication that</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.100" end="00:06:49.100" style="s2">the collapse of...</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.300" end="00:06:53.235" style="s2">classic systems of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.240" end="00:06:55.860" style="s2">open up people to posession by</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.860" end="00:06:59.080" style="s2">nihilism and also by potentially totalitarian</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.135" end="00:07:02.195" style="s2">political systems and that seems to have been what happened</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.195" end="00:07:04.965" style="s2">Now, Heidegger was very concerned about that,</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.315" end="00:07:08.675" style="s2">among other things. And so, he decided to</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.085" end="00:07:10.385" style="s2">reconsider</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.195" end="00:07:13.325" style="s2">reality from the bottom up.</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.800" end="00:07:16.380" style="s2">And so, what he did was generate an alternative set</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.500" end="00:07:19.300" style="s2">of axioms. He said something like &quot;what if we</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.305" end="00:07:20.745" style="s2">decide</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.560" end="00:07:24.400" style="s2">to make reality everything that we</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.400" end="00:07:27.700" style="s2">experience? Forget about the subject/object divide.</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.400" end="00:07:30.915" style="s2">And...One of the other problems with</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.915" end="00:07:32.315" style="s2">the subject/object divide</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.315" end="00:07:34.795" style="s2">for example, is accounting for consciousness, right? because</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.800" end="00:07:37.560" style="s2">it&#39;s a problem that science really hasn&#39;t got any distance with</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.560" end="00:07:40.900" style="s2">at all, as far as I can tell. I mean, people have been trying to crack</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.905" end="00:07:43.955" style="s2">the secret of counsciousness, obviously, for a very long time</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.245" end="00:07:46.665" style="s2">but they&#39;ve been trying to do it formally</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.665" end="00:07:49.675" style="s2">and using scientific methods, at least for the last</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.675" end="00:07:52.495" style="s2">50 years and my sense of that is that they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.495" end="00:07:53.855" style="s2">got absolutely nowhere.</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.760" end="00:07:57.280" style="s2">Maybe, that&#39;s a bit unfair. We&#39;re better at</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.280" end="00:07:59.720" style="s2">representing how conscious experiences</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.980" end="00:08:02.555" style="s2">manifest themselves in the brain but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.555" end="00:08:04.765" style="s2">but we&#39;re certainly no better at understanding</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.335" end="00:08:08.285" style="s2">how it is that we experience things. And that&#39;s the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.285" end="00:08:09.285" style="s2">&quot;qualia&quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.840" end="00:08:12.740" style="s2">That&#39;s how the philosophers describe it. And qualia is</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.740" end="00:08:15.860" style="s2">the quality of your experience, like the fact that pain,</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.860" end="00:08:19.215" style="s2">for example...A pain you feel</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.215" end="00:08:22.135" style="s2">is by no means identical, at least, as far as your concerned,</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.135" end="00:08:25.065" style="s2">to some pattern of neurological activity, right?</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.065" end="00:08:28.065" style="s2">It&#39;s pain. It seems to be a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.065" end="00:08:30.780" style="s2">reality of some... In fact, I think pain is THE fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.780" end="00:08:33.640" style="s2">reality. I think it&#39;s the only thing that people will never</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.640" end="00:08:34.640" style="s2">deny.</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.180" end="00:08:36.180" style="s2">But...</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.035" end="00:08:39.485" style="s2">So, there&#39;s these aspects of your</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.485" end="00:08:41.780" style="s2">existence that are subjective, like your experience of</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.780" end="00:08:44.420" style="s2">colour and your experience of beauty and just your experience</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.660" end="00:08:47.500" style="s2">of things or, maybe, just your experience.</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.555" end="00:08:49.065" style="s2">Your eperience plays an</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.485" end="00:08:50.995" style="s2">indeterminate role</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.905" end="00:08:55.045" style="s2">in the structure of being itself. &#39;Cause you might ask, well,</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.135" end="00:08:58.045" style="s2">what would there be if there was nothing conscious?</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.175" end="00:08:59.775" style="s2">and you could say, well...</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.160" end="00:09:04.000" style="s2">what would there be if there was nothing conscious of being?</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.000" end="00:09:05.880" style="s2">Well, it&#39;s a tricky question, because</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.420" end="00:09:08.815" style="s2">it depends on your a priori</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.815" end="00:09:11.435" style="s2">axioms but...it&#39;s not obvious what</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.435" end="00:09:14.105" style="s2">there would be in the absence of a conscious oberver.</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.680" end="00:09:16.900" style="s2">There wouldn&#39;t obviously be any</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.900" end="00:09:19.720" style="s2">duration between things. It would be very difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.720" end="00:09:22.980" style="s2">specify things in terms of size. There wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.000" end="00:09:25.975" style="s2">any of the qualities that we experience...</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.980" end="00:09:28.460" style="s2">...that we experience our being is having &#39;cause</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.460" end="00:09:31.160" style="s2">colour doesn&#39;t seem to be an intrinsic part of the world,</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.160" end="00:09:34.040" style="s2">smell doesn&#39;t seem to be an intrinsic part of the world.</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.540" end="00:09:37.260" style="s2">It&#39;s very difficult. The more you think about it, you&#39;d find</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.260" end="00:09:40.375" style="s2">the more difficut it is to determine exactly what there would</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.375" end="00:09:42.575" style="s2">be if there was no one to observe it.</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.035" end="00:09:45.975" style="s2">And...that&#39;s not the tree-in-the-forest idea, precisely</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.975" end="00:09:49.055" style="s2">It&#39;s not so much if a tree falls in the forest</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.060" end="00:09:51.500" style="s2">and there&#39;s no one to hear it, it doesn&#39;t make a sound</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.500" end="00:09:54.820" style="s2">&#39;cause that&#39;s more a matter of the definition of sound than anything else.</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.820" end="00:09:57.940" style="s2">This is more, like, if there&#39;s a tree in the forest and there isn&#39;t anyone,</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.940" end="00:10:00.660" style="s2">is there a tree ? And that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.660" end="00:10:04.140" style="s2">whole different question. Anyways, so, what Heidegger did,</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.920" end="00:10:08.780" style="s2">partly because he was not pleased, I suppose,</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.780" end="00:10:10.800" style="s2">with the metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.805" end="00:10:13.385" style="s2">consequences of the scientific worldview,</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.595" end="00:10:16.715" style="s2">and also, perhaps, because he wasn&#39;t very</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.715" end="00:10:19.355" style="s2">happy about our ability to account for consciousness,</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.360" end="00:10:22.560" style="s2">he decided to see what would happen if he played</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.560" end="00:10:24.740" style="s2">a different kind of game. And</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.740" end="00:10:28.020" style="s2">you can do that in an intellectual discussion, you know, you can say, well,</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.480" end="00:10:31.140" style="s2">here&#39;s a set of axioms out of which a system</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.140" end="00:10:34.220" style="s2">will emerge, like, here&#39;s a set of rules out of which a game</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.220" end="00:10:36.300" style="s2">would emerge. Same idea.</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.860" end="00:10:39.660" style="s2">What if we start with a different set of rules? Let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.660" end="00:10:43.060" style="s2">what we can do if we do that. You kind of do that when you play one video game</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.060" end="00:10:45.420" style="s2">rather than another. You know, there&#39;re little worlds</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.420" end="00:10:48.400" style="s2">that pop out. There&#39;s a different underlining structure.</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.400" end="00:10:51.620" style="s2">And then, you can go inside that world and experiment with it and</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.625" end="00:10:53.615" style="s2">see what comes out of it.</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.755" end="00:10:57.925" style="s2">So Heidegger decided to say &quot;OK, what we&#39;re gonna do instead</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.925" end="00:11:00.765" style="s2">is we&#39;re going to assume that everything we experience is real.</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.765" end="00:11:03.815" style="s2">We&#39;re going to make our field of experience itself</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.815" end="00:11:05.665" style="s2">reality&quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.375" end="00:11:09.755" style="s2">And...So that would mean, from Heidegger&#39;s point of view,</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.135" end="00:11:11.135" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.315" end="00:11:12.695" style="s2">everything about</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.685" end="00:11:17.715" style="s2">the being that manifests itself to you is to be regarded as</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.715" end="00:11:20.535" style="s2">equallly real. So, then, you think, well, that makes pain</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.535" end="00:11:23.865" style="s2">a fundamental reality. That makes anxiety a fundamental reality.</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.865" end="00:11:26.560" style="s2">It makes beauty and colour fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.560" end="00:11:29.180" style="s2">realities. They&#39;re not self-evidently</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.325" end="00:11:32.680" style="s2">reducible to anything else, which they would be...</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.335" end="00:11:36.085" style="s2">...which they are in a scientific...from a scientific</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.085" end="00:11:38.545" style="s2">perspective because you have to think about them as</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.545" end="00:11:41.260" style="s2">manifestations of some more fundamental underlying</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.260" end="00:11:44.720" style="s2">material reality. And I guess that&#39;s another problem with the</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.940" end="00:11:47.955" style="s2">subject/object model and the material</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.955" end="00:11:48.965" style="s2">model.</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.515" end="00:11:52.525" style="s2">When you aggregate atoms, when you</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.525" end="00:11:55.585" style="s2">arrange them in certain forms.</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.585" end="00:11:58.160" style="s2">When they manifest themselves as certain molecules and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.160" end="00:12:01.380" style="s2">in more complex structures, they seem to take on all sorts</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.380" end="00:12:04.655" style="s2">of qualities that you couldn&#39;t predict if you just knew about</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.655" end="00:12:05.655" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.775" end="00:12:09.235" style="s2">subatomic particles and the atoms themselves and so, of course, the...</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.135" end="00:12:13.115" style="s2">those are called emerging properties and you say, well, you can</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.625" end="00:12:17.585" style="s2">observe hydrogen and you can observe oxygen but</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.885" end="00:12:19.885" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t make it self-evident</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.465" end="00:12:23.805" style="s2">for you to be able to predict the properties of water. And, of course,</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.805" end="00:12:26.505" style="s2">that&#39;s a more simpler problem, all things considered,</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.505" end="00:12:29.435" style="s2">than the problem of figuring YOU out. You&#39;re this</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.435" end="00:12:32.635" style="s2">crazily complex aggregate of these hypothetical...</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.795" end="00:12:35.235" style="s2">hypothetically simple entities but</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.560" end="00:12:36.920" style="s2">it isn&#39;t obvious how</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.680" end="00:12:40.580" style="s2">their elemental properties can combine</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.580" end="00:12:43.440" style="s2">to produce YOU. It&#39;s not obvious at all.</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.440" end="00:12:46.760" style="s2">It&#39;s certainly not obious how a material that&#39;s supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.760" end="00:12:49.740" style="s2">dead matter, so to speak, can</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.745" end="00:12:52.615" style="s2">manifest consciousness,</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.865" end="00:12:55.335" style="s2">no matter how complexly it&#39;s arranged.</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.925" end="00:12:57.005" style="s2">So...</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.715" end="00:13:00.595" style="s2">The phenomenologists,</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.405" end="00:13:05.175" style="s2">Heidegger leading them, were...</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.180" end="00:13:07.800" style="s2">attempted to produce a philosophical model of</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.800" end="00:13:09.100" style="s2">being.</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.335" end="00:13:12.365" style="s2">And...We&#39;ll talk more specifically about the phenomenologists</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.365" end="00:13:15.455" style="s2">after we&#39;re done with Rogers, but he is...</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.455" end="00:13:17.115" style="s2">he fits in that</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.575" end="00:13:18.795" style="s2">philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.445" end="00:13:20.515" style="s2">framework.</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.615" end="00:13:22.615" style="s2">And...</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.685" end="00:13:38.095" style="s2">One of the things that I&#39;ve thought...</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.855" end="00:13:41.655" style="s2">-- This is a bit of a tangent but I&#39;ll move back</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.655" end="00:13:43.055" style="s2">to the model afterwards. --</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.015" end="00:13:46.505" style="s2">See, I really like the psychoanalysts.</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.505" end="00:13:49.055" style="s2">And I like the idea that you have a psyche that&#39;s inside</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.055" end="00:13:51.305" style="s2">of you and that is structured, in part</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.305" end="00:13:53.985" style="s2">consciously and in part uncounsciously.</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.985" end="00:13:56.905" style="s2">There&#39;s something about that that&#39;s really cool and I&#39;ve learned a lot</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.225" end="00:14:00.405" style="s2">from the psychoanalysts. But, you know, there is a funny</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.895" end="00:14:04.045" style="s2">conesquence of thinking the way they think -- and you do</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.045" end="00:14:06.495" style="s2">think the way they think, even if you don&#39;t know it --</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.805" end="00:14:09.815" style="s2">like we tend to think that a lot of us is inside our head,</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.815" end="00:14:12.925" style="s2">you know. That&#39;s the psyche model basically.</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.145" end="00:14:16.105" style="s2">But, the more I&#39;ve practised as a clinical psychologist</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.105" end="00:14:18.435" style="s2">the less I&#39;ve actually been convinced that that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.035" end="00:14:21.925" style="s2">So, I could say, well...Let&#39;s say I want to know about</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.925" end="00:14:24.555" style="s2">your personality. We think, well, I wanna now</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.555" end="00:14:27.455" style="s2">you. I wanna know about your subjectivity and I want to know</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.455" end="00:14:29.005" style="s2">what&#39;s inside of you.</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.475" end="00:14:32.175" style="s2">But that is not exactly what you do want to know if you&#39;re doing clinical</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.175" end="00:14:34.545" style="s2">work, say, with someone. You wanna know</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.665" end="00:14:37.245" style="s2">do they have any friends?</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.725" end="00:14:40.435" style="s2">That&#39;s really important. Because, if you&#39;re miserable</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.435" end="00:14:43.165" style="s2">and anxious and badly placed in life</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.165" end="00:14:44.845" style="s2">and misbehaving,</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.440" end="00:14:47.660" style="s2">one of the reasons that all of that can occur is  &#39;cause</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.660" end="00:14:50.980" style="s2">you don&#39;t have any friends, you don&#39;t know anyone. And that&#39;s not something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.980" end="00:14:52.320" style="s2">inside you.</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.635" end="00:14:54.815" style="s2">It&#39;s you, localized</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.180" end="00:14:57.900" style="s2">in a broader sphere. And then, you might say, well, do you</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.900" end="00:14:59.220" style="s2">have a job?</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.265" end="00:15:01.755" style="s2">And...Well, let&#39;s talk about the job. Do you actually make enough</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.755" end="00:15:04.615" style="s2">money with your job? Is it satisfying for</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.615" end="00:15:07.615" style="s2">you in any way? Are you bullied all the time when you&#39;re at work?</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.615" end="00:15:10.395" style="s2">Does it provoke anxiety? Is it a carrier that allows</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.395" end="00:15:13.445" style="s2">you to go somewhere? Are you overworked?</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.445" end="00:15:15.820" style="s2">Or...But let&#39;s start with just the first question.</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.820" end="00:15:19.400" style="s2">Do you have a job? Well, if the answer to that is &quot;no&quot;,</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.595" end="00:15:22.435" style="s2">you have a serious problem and that would enough</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.435" end="00:15:25.155" style="s2">might be to depress you and make you anxious and</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.155" end="00:15:28.135" style="s2">hopeless and nihilistic and all of those things. And, you could say, well,</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.135" end="00:15:31.045" style="s2">you&#39;re not reacting very well to not having a job but</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.185" end="00:15:34.125" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of a foolish objection, even though some of</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.125" end="00:15:37.115" style="s2">it might be true. One problem is that you&#39;re not reacting very</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.115" end="00:15:40.005" style="s2">well to not having a job but another problem is that you don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.005" end="00:15:43.165" style="s2">job and that, actually, constitutes the problem,</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.245" end="00:15:46.295" style="s2">right? You don&#39;t get to eat, you don&#39;t have a place to live.</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.295" end="00:15:49.185" style="s2">Those aren&#39;t psychological problems precisely, even</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.185" end="00:15:52.215" style="s2">though a psychological probem could make it worse.</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.215" end="00:15:55.095" style="s2">Well, are you as educated as you should be?</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.100" end="00:15:57.800" style="s2">That&#39;s another question. How do you handle drugs and alcohol?</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.800" end="00:16:00.540" style="s2">Are they taking you down a bad pathway? Know?</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.975" end="00:16:01.975" style="s2">Uhmm...</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.260" end="00:16:04.800" style="s2">What about intimate relationships ? Do you have one?</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.800" end="00:16:08.020" style="s2">Do you have a plan for one? Or is that a never ending series of</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.025" end="00:16:11.075" style="s2">catastrophes or something that you avoid completely?</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.075" end="00:16:13.865" style="s2">That&#39;s a big problem! And, maybe, people don&#39;t...</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.865" end="00:16:16.915" style="s2">aren&#39;t attracted to you for one reason or another and.... You can think about that as</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.915" end="00:16:19.585" style="s2">a psychological problem but...it&#39;s an interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.585" end="00:16:20.585" style="s2">problem.</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.935" end="00:16:24.065" style="s2">And the degree to which that&#39;s a psychological problem is...</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.360" end="00:16:26.740" style="s2">is certainly unspecified when</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.740" end="00:16:30.480" style="s2">you first begin to talk to somebody. What about your family? Do you have a family?</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.905" end="00:16:34.145" style="s2">&#39;Cause&#39; it&#39;s hard to be in the world all by yourself. That&#39;s for sure!</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.145" end="00:16:37.225" style="s2">It makes things a lot more stressful...even though having a family</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.225" end="00:16:40.105" style="s2">can also be extraordinarily stressful...you know..</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.105" end="00:16:43.155" style="s2">Do you have plans to have children? How are you doing with your parents?</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.160" end="00:16:45.580" style="s2">Do you get along with your siblings? You know, all of</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.580" end="00:16:47.900" style="s2">that, all of that, to me, is more</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.900" end="00:16:52.700" style="s2">fundamental and it&#39;s outside of you. Those are elements of your experience.</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.700" end="00:16:54.815" style="s2">More broadly...conceptualized...</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.820" end="00:16:57.580" style="s2">more than they are objects of your psychology</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.580" end="00:17:01.160" style="s2">or of your internal experience.  You know, it&#39;s sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.835" end="00:17:07.835" style="s2">Well, a person is a creature that exists</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.835" end="00:17:09.945" style="s2">at multiple levels of analysis.</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.360" end="00:17:12.760" style="s2">Right? Something might go wrong with you at a</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.760" end="00:17:16.115" style="s2">cellular level. So, maybe, you&#39;re born with a genetic abnormality.</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.115" end="00:17:18.705" style="s2">So, something&#39;s wrong with you molecularly.</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.705" end="00:17:21.440" style="s2">Or you have something wrong with a major organ.</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.440" end="00:17:24.260" style="s2">Or, maybe, there&#39;s something wrong with you psycologically. Or, maybe,</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.260" end="00:17:26.920" style="s2">you&#39;re in a pathological family. Or, maybe, you&#39;re stuck</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.920" end="00:17:30.375" style="s2">in a pathological social system. And...</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.375" end="00:17:33.205" style="s2">figuring out why you&#39;re suffering</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.260" end="00:17:35.600" style="s2">means going up and down those different levels trying</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.600" end="00:17:37.680" style="s2">to specify the appropriate level</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.685" end="00:17:40.745" style="s2">for analysis and also the appropriate level for intervention.</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.745" end="00:17:43.715" style="s2">And, for me, as I said, even though I&#39;m a great admirer</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.715" end="00:17:45.755" style="s2">of the psychoanalysts and I do</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.755" end="00:17:48.945" style="s2">things like dream analysis which I really find</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.945" end="00:17:51.500" style="s2">incredibly useful and enlightning, the first, the</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.500" end="00:17:55.195" style="s2">fundamental level of analysis is, well, what&#39;s your experience structured like...</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.195" end="00:17:58.075" style="s2">exactly? And that isn&#39;t localized in you.</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.075" end="00:18:00.805" style="s2">Now, the behaviourists do that to, because...</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.805" end="00:18:03.755" style="s2">-- which is one of the things I really like about the behaviourial approach of psychotherapy.</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.760" end="00:18:06.480" style="s2">It&#39;s very very concrete and practical. It&#39;s like,</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.480" end="00:18:07.840" style="s2">they&#39;ll say, well,</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.180" end="00:18:10.760" style="s2">there&#39;re certain things that you need to have in order to live properly</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.760" end="00:18:12.880" style="s2">and, maybe, you don&#39;t have the skills or the wherewithwall...</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.880" end="00:18:15.800" style="s2">wherewithal to accumulate them and we&#39;ll break them down</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.800" end="00:18:19.080" style="s2">into tiny little pieces and you&#39;ll practice. So, for example,</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.085" end="00:18:21.965" style="s2">someone who doesn&#39;t have any friends and you do a micro-analysis</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.965" end="00:18:24.560" style="s2">of their...social skills, say,</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.560" end="00:18:26.995" style="s2">and maybe an analysis of the kind of anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.000" end="00:18:29.720" style="s2">that are stopping them from going out and meeting people</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.720" end="00:18:32.940" style="s2">and then you address those things practically one by one. You try</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.940" end="00:18:36.215" style="s2">to get the person have some friends. You try to figure out how they can</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.215" end="00:18:38.925" style="s2">establish an intimate relationship. You see if you could help</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.925" end="00:18:41.360" style="s2">them sort out their family. You do what you can about their</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.360" end="00:18:44.715" style="s2">employment and...A lot of that&#39;s only tangentially related</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.715" end="00:18:47.965" style="s2">to -- really, in some sense -- to the structure of their psyche.</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.965" end="00:18:50.800" style="s2">But, one of the things you&#39;ll see, if you work as a</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.800" end="00:18:53.915" style="s2">clinician, or as a counsellor, is that, most of the time, people</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.915" end="00:18:56.825" style="s2">come and see you because they have problems, not because they have psychological</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.825" end="00:18:57.895" style="s2">problems.</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.320" end="00:19:00.900" style="s2">And those things are not that easy to distinguish.</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.900" end="00:19:04.495" style="s2">You know, it&#39;s sort of the psychoanalytic idea, sort of like, well, if you juste got</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.495" end="00:19:07.495" style="s2">your act together, everything would work out for you. It&#39;s like,</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.545" end="00:19:08.545" style="s2">yeaaaah...</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.365" end="00:19:12.975" style="s2">There&#39;s some truth in that.</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.405" end="00:19:14.405" style="s2">But...</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.200" end="00:19:19.700" style="s2">But, you know if you&#39;re 55 years old and you&#39;ve just been</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.700" end="00:19:21.260" style="s2">laid off work,</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.320" end="00:19:24.520" style="s2">and, maybe, through no fault of your own,</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.920" end="00:19:28.380" style="s2">it isn&#39;t obvious how much getting your act together</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.380" end="00:19:31.100" style="s2">is gonna help you find another job...because...</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.100" end="00:19:34.375" style="s2">the actual problem that you&#39;re facing may have</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.375" end="00:19:37.335" style="s2">relatively little to do with you. And that would especially be the case</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.335" end="00:19:38.335" style="s2">if you&#39;re,</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.835" end="00:19:41.815" style="s2">maybe, on the bottom half of the itelligence distribution,</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.815" end="00:19:43.625" style="s2">for example, and so...it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.625" end="00:19:46.300" style="s2">as easy for you just to go out and pick up new</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.300" end="00:19:49.260" style="s2">skills at the drop of a hat...you know...and that</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.260" end="00:19:52.220" style="s2">gets harder as you get older because your IQ actually declines quite</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.220" end="00:19:55.680" style="s2">substantially as you get older, the working or the....</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.680" end="00:19:58.480" style="s2">the fluid intelligence part, anyways -- exercise</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.480" end="00:20:01.560" style="s2">can keep that at bay, by the way, it&#39;s the best way to keep that at bay.</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.525" end="00:20:05.385" style="s2">So, anyways...you can think,</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.385" end="00:20:07.775" style="s2">from the phenomenological viewpoint, of</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.775" end="00:20:10.465" style="s2">your experience as a whole, instead of</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.465" end="00:20:12.440" style="s2">you being a subject in an objective world.</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.440" end="00:20:16.020" style="s2">And so...here&#39;s another way of...here&#39;s something that&#39;s quite useful.</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.025" end="00:20:17.455" style="s2">Jung talked about this</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.460" end="00:20:20.100" style="s2">&#39;cause he was moving towards a phenomenological perspective later</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.100" end="00:20:23.875" style="s2">in his life. The last book he wrote was called Mysterium Coniunctionis.</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.875" end="00:20:26.755" style="s2">He talked about three conjunctions</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.755" end="00:20:29.615" style="s2">that needed to take place in order for someone to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.615" end="00:20:32.605" style="s2">well constituted psychologically. And, you know how</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.605" end="00:20:34.075" style="s2">Piaget talked about</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.685" end="00:20:35.895" style="s2">learning that you could,</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.215" end="00:20:39.225" style="s2">not only follow rules, but that you could make rules for new</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.225" end="00:20:42.395" style="s2">games as sort of a highest level of moral development. I would say</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.395" end="00:20:45.405" style="s2">Jung extended the Piagetian</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.405" end="00:20:47.220" style="s2">moral continuum</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.220" end="00:20:50.500" style="s2">up past what Piaget had envisioned. Now, he didn&#39;t...</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.675" end="00:20:54.015" style="s2">he didn&#39;t do that &#39;cause he wasn&#39;t trying to extend Piaget&#39;s model. But...</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.805" end="00:20:57.855" style="s2">But you can think about it the same way. And it&#39;s not easy to</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.855" end="00:20:58.915" style="s2">come up with a moral</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.220" end="00:21:02.980" style="s2">mode of being, say, that transcends the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.980" end="00:21:06.215" style="s2">make rules for new games. That&#39;s damn smart, man, that&#39;s...</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.215" end="00:21:08.115" style="s2">That&#39;s a major home run by Piaget,</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.115" end="00:21:10.895" style="s2">as far as I am concerned. But Jung said something like this.</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.900" end="00:21:13.280" style="s2">He said, look, when you&#39;re going through the process of</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.280" end="00:21:15.040" style="s2">psychological integration...</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.885" end="00:21:20.255" style="s2">Here&#39;s a way of conceptualizing it. He thought about this as...</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.185" end="00:21:24.475" style="s2">symbolically, as male-female pairings, because...</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.955" end="00:21:28.005" style="s2">as I&#39;ve tried to point out, the most... one of the most fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.005" end="00:21:30.935" style="s2">categories that our mythological imagination</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.935" end="00:21:33.705" style="s2">uses to structure the world is the category</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.705" end="00:21:36.815" style="s2">of masculine and feminine. And it moves that around, you know,</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.815" end="00:21:39.825" style="s2">it&#39;s a fundamental metaphor so you can move that around anywhere.</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.945" end="00:21:42.975" style="s2">And so Jung thought well, one of the things that you&#39;re trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.100" end="00:21:45.620" style="s2">is to get your thoughts and your emotions</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.620" end="00:21:47.000" style="s2">integrated.</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.295" end="00:21:50.125" style="s2">And so, you know, the classic Enlightenment viewpoint,</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.125" end="00:21:52.085" style="s2">roughly speaking, is something like,</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.475" end="00:21:54.585" style="s2">passion is the enemy of reason.</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.220" end="00:21:57.700" style="s2">Right? And so, to the degree that you&#39;re rational, it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.700" end="00:22:01.140" style="s2">a Freudian viewpoint &#39;cause you&#39;ve got your emotions under control.</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.595" end="00:22:04.705" style="s2">And...there&#39;s some truth in that but...not enough truth.</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.705" end="00:22:07.595" style="s2">I like the Piagetian idea better, which is that,</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.600" end="00:22:10.220" style="s2">no, no, that isn&#39;t what happens. What happens is if...</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.220" end="00:22:13.415" style="s2">if you&#39;re playing the proper game is that, you integrate your</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.415" end="00:22:16.625" style="s2">emotions underneath your thinkings, something like that.</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.645" end="00:22:19.655" style="s2">So, they&#39;re all working in the same direction, you know. So,</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.655" end="00:22:21.165" style="s2">for example,</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.165" end="00:22:24.135" style="s2">you can make your anxiety work against you or for you.</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.140" end="00:22:25.680" style="s2">And, one of the ways...</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.940" end="00:22:28.920" style="s2">I made a program, called the Future Authoring Program</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.920" end="00:22:31.960" style="s2">that I think helps people do that. &#39;Cause, one of the things you see when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.960" end="00:22:35.040" style="s2">talking to people and they&#39;re trying to solve problems is that they&#39;re afraid to</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.040" end="00:22:36.560" style="s2">face the problem.</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.015" end="00:22:39.915" style="s2">And so, then, their anxiety is working against them and you can think about it as a...</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.915" end="00:22:43.265" style="s2">as antagonistic to rationality.</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.705" end="00:22:46.755" style="s2">But then, I could say, well, what if you think for a while about</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.760" end="00:22:49.140" style="s2">what your life would be like if you didn&#39;t face</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.140" end="00:22:50.420" style="s2">this problem?</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.840" end="00:22:53.280" style="s2">Because, if you think that through, if you have a problem and you</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.280" end="00:22:56.720" style="s2">really think through what the consequences are</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.720" end="00:22:59.280" style="s2">gonna be in two to three years of not facing it, then</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.280" end="00:23:02.440" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna get more afraid of not facing it than facing it.</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.440" end="00:23:05.255" style="s2">And that&#39;s great because then, your anxiety, instead of</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.260" end="00:23:07.580" style="s2">standing in front of you...instead of...</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.580" end="00:23:10.220" style="s2">you having a dragon that&#39;s guarding the path in front of you, you</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.220" end="00:23:13.680" style="s2">have one chasing you down the path from behind. That&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.685" end="00:23:14.975" style="s2">a lot more useful.</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.435" end="00:23:16.435" style="s2">And so...</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.565" end="00:23:18.025" style="s2">you know, that&#39;s just a...</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.525" end="00:23:21.705" style="s2">a minimal example of the utility of getting your emotions</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.705" end="00:23:22.675" style="s2">and your...</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.680" end="00:23:24.960" style="s2">and your thoughts aligned the same way. The same</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.960" end="00:23:26.780" style="s2">thing happens with the aggression.</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.185" end="00:23:30.045" style="s2">You know...One of the most common reasons that people come and</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.045" end="00:23:33.215" style="s2">seek psychotherapy, really, is because they&#39;re too agreeable.</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.220" end="00:23:35.860" style="s2">But...what that means is they&#39;re not assertive enough. They haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.860" end="00:23:39.680" style="s2">integrated their capacity for aggression. And so, other people can push them around.</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.935" end="00:23:43.205" style="s2">And...and they&#39;re very conflict avoidant.</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.225" end="00:23:46.165" style="s2">And...and so, the consequences of that across time</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.165" end="00:23:49.475" style="s2">is that you don&#39;t stand up for yourself well enough</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.475" end="00:23:52.355" style="s2">and you get taken advantage of and that spirals</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.355" end="00:23:55.795" style="s2">badly downwards. And so, partly what you do when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.435" end="00:23:59.085" style="s2">doing assertiveness training with people</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.085" end="00:24:02.075" style="s2">is you find out what they&#39;re angry about...and...</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.080" end="00:24:04.700" style="s2">They&#39;re usuallly angry, if they&#39;re not assertive enough,</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.700" end="00:24:07.800" style="s2">because other people are taking advantage of them or, you could say, because they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.800" end="00:24:09.160" style="s2">putting their own...</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.440" end="00:24:10.980" style="s2">necessities forward</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.980" end="00:24:14.340" style="s2">with enough force. It&#39;s hard to distinguish between those two things.</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.615" end="00:24:15.835" style="s2">But, anyways, you...</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.235" end="00:24:18.715" style="s2">get them to talk about what they&#39;re angry about,</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.715" end="00:24:21.965" style="s2">that often makes them cry, often many times,</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.965" end="00:24:24.720" style="s2">and then, you get them to kind of envision what they would want</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.720" end="00:24:27.520" style="s2">to have instead, which they&#39;re often afraid to do</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.520" end="00:24:31.020" style="s2">because people are afraid to think about what they want</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.025" end="00:24:33.865" style="s2">because that makes it more clear when they&#39;re not getting it</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.865" end="00:24:36.620" style="s2">and that&#39;s painful, right?  Or, maybe, they&#39;re afraid of hoping</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.620" end="00:24:39.580" style="s2">so they won&#39;t specify a clear aim. But, anyways, you get them to</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.580" end="00:24:42.835" style="s2">think about what they might want instead. You get them</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.840" end="00:24:45.140" style="s2">to think about the cost of not pursuing that</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.140" end="00:24:48.800" style="s2">and then, you help them develop strategies for integrating</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.800" end="00:24:52.160" style="s2">their aggression and... with their thinking,</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.165" end="00:24:54.775" style="s2">so they can come up with a plan to</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.775" end="00:24:57.635" style="s2">approach the world in a more confident way. So, for example,</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.635" end="00:25:01.115" style="s2">someone might come to me and say &quot;I&#39;m being bullied badly at work&quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.335" end="00:25:04.165" style="s2">And so, then, I&#39;ll say &quot;well, what are your options?</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.520" end="00:25:06.680" style="s2">You have to put up with it? Well,</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.680" end="00:25:09.835" style="s2">we&#39;ll figure that out cause maybe you do, maybe you don&#39;t have options.</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.835" end="00:25:12.905" style="s2">But here&#39;s how to find out. Get your damn CV together,</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.905" end="00:25:16.055" style="s2">so it&#39;s pristine, right? It&#39;s ready to go.</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.055" end="00:25:19.015" style="s2">Get over your fear of a new interview, because</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.015" end="00:25:22.015" style="s2">people are generally afraid of that. Get over your fear of applying</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.015" end="00:25:24.915" style="s2">for a new job. Start thinking about what it would mean to have</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.915" end="00:25:28.155" style="s2">a different job. Start thinking about what it would mean to have</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.155" end="00:25:31.005" style="s2">a better job, even. Cause, maybe, your fear</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.005" end="00:25:33.665" style="s2">is just making you stuck here but I can tell you one thing :</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.665" end="00:25:36.785" style="s2">if someone&#39;s picking on you at work and you don&#39;t have options,</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.785" end="00:25:38.005" style="s2">you lose.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.395" end="00:25:41.665" style="s2">So you get the person to start building a strategy. It&#39;s like, &quot;OK,</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.665" end="00:25:44.615" style="s2">if you&#39;re gonna tell this person to stop,</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.680" end="00:25:46.780" style="s2">you have to know how to make them stop</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.780" end="00:25:49.900" style="s2">and the one thing you need for sure is an option,</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.900" end="00:25:52.460" style="s2">and, if you can&#39;t...if you don&#39;t have an option</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.460" end="00:25:55.535" style="s2">then, maybe, we start thinking about the fact that you need some more</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.535" end="00:25:58.395" style="s2">training or something like that. Because you cannot negotiate</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.395" end="00:26:00.045" style="s2">if you don&#39;t have any power.</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.380" end="00:26:02.960" style="s2">So...because while....especially if you&#39;re dealing with someone</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.960" end="00:26:06.080" style="s2">who&#39;s really out to get you or really disagreeable,</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.080" end="00:26:08.920" style="s2">If you don&#39;t have a leg to stand on, they&#39;ll just push you over and, maybe, they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.920" end="00:26:12.315" style="s2">jump on you too because that&#39;s what they&#39;re like and enjoy anyways, so...</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.315" end="00:26:13.315" style="s2">It&#39;s no joke.</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.675" end="00:26:14.675" style="s2">So...</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.885" end="00:26:17.305" style="s2">You put your options behind you and then you</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.305" end="00:26:20.195" style="s2">start to think about strategy.&quot; So I tell people &quot;Look,</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.195" end="00:26:23.105" style="s2">if you&#39;re being harassed at work, you document it every time</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.105" end="00:26:25.440" style="s2">it happens. You write it down. So you&#39;ve got like twenty</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.440" end="00:26:28.620" style="s2">stories about it and it&#39;s fully documented. And then,</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.620" end="00:26:31.280" style="s2">you go confront the person at some point with, at least,</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.280" end="00:26:33.880" style="s2">3 pieces of evidence. And you have some</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.880" end="00:26:37.600" style="s2">sense about what you tell them about what will happen if they don&#39;t stop.</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.865" end="00:26:40.615" style="s2">So you have to figure out : well, they don&#39;t stop?</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.720" end="00:26:43.460" style="s2">What are you gonna do about it? Leave? Not if you</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.460" end="00:26:46.815" style="s2">can&#39;t leave. So, you have to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.815" end="00:26:49.775" style="s2">-- what is it? -- wield a big stick and speak softly.</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.785" end="00:26:52.945" style="s2">But, you see, that way...that&#39;s how you take your</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.945" end="00:26:55.375" style="s2">aggression, which is an absolute necessary</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.375" end="00:26:58.525" style="s2">part of your psyche and manifest it up into</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.525" end="00:27:01.585" style="s2">a sophisticated means of dealing with the world.</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.585" end="00:27:04.605" style="s2">You don&#39;t just suppress it and say &quot;well, I should be able to put up with it&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.605" end="00:27:07.745" style="s2">or &quot;I wish I wasn&#39;t so angry&quot; or some...it&#39;s like...forget that!</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.345" end="00:27:09.345" style="s2">That&#39;s...</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.580" end="00:27:12.280" style="s2">All that&#39;ll happen is your blood pressure will stay high and you&#39;ll die of a heart</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.280" end="00:27:15.680" style="s2">attack. Because anger, for example, is a very toxic emotion.</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.000" end="00:27:18.320" style="s2">And it does cause heart damage over time. It&#39;s the only</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.320" end="00:27:21.220" style="s2">emotion that we really know that&#39;s been linked to things like</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.220" end="00:27:25.020" style="s2">cardiovascular risk. And anger is toxic because</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.435" end="00:27:27.885" style="s2">it&#39;s like, you&#39;re driving a car, you&#39;re stepping on the gas</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.885" end="00:27:29.940" style="s2">and pushing on the brake at the same time. Because</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.940" end="00:27:32.860" style="s2">anger tells you to run away and to attack</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.365" end="00:27:36.445" style="s2">...at the same time, cause you don&#39;t know what&#39;s gonna happen. And so, it</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.445" end="00:27:39.060" style="s2">really amps up the physiological</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.060" end="00:27:42.295" style="s2">demand on your body. And so, if you...</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.300" end="00:27:44.780" style="s2">-- including your heart and your musculature -- so, if you stay like that for</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.780" end="00:27:47.820" style="s2">like 10 years, you know...you&#39;re gonna age</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.820" end="00:27:49.300" style="s2">20 years.</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.675" end="00:27:51.275" style="s2">And that&#39;s a bad plan.</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.685" end="00:27:52.685" style="s2">So...</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.920" end="00:27:55.720" style="s2">So, you know, you take your</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.720" end="00:27:59.235" style="s2">underground emotions and you integrate them into a sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.235" end="00:28:00.375" style="s2">reality.</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.095" end="00:28:02.095" style="s2">Now...</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.305" end="00:28:04.805" style="s2">Jung said, so</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.375" end="00:28:08.355" style="s2">&quot;FIrst of all you unite your mind,</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.360" end="00:28:11.100" style="s2">your thinking, let&#39;s say, with your emotions. So that makes one</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.100" end="00:28:14.180" style="s2">thing, instead of two fighting things.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.455" end="00:28:17.425" style="s2">OK. That&#39;s a good one. And then, the next conjunction</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.425" end="00:28:18.740" style="s2">he talked about was</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.960" end="00:28:21.795" style="s2">&quot;It isn&#39;tenough to unite your mind</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.800" end="00:28:24.200" style="s2">and your emotions&quot;. And he tought about that as male/female</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.200" end="00:28:26.120" style="s2">pairing, symbolically. That&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.120" end="00:28:29.080" style="s2">it would manifest itself sometimes in dreams. So you</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.085" end="00:28:32.135" style="s2">take the masculine element and the feminine element,</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.135" end="00:28:35.145" style="s2">the thinking and the emotion, unite</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.145" end="00:28:37.840" style="s2">those and that makes you more like one thing. OK and now,</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.840" end="00:28:41.060" style="s2">all of a sudden, that&#39;s represented as symbolicaly male, that one thing.</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.100" end="00:28:43.100" style="s2">And it unites with something else that&#39;s now represented</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.100" end="00:28:46.520" style="s2">symbolically femin...female. That&#39;s the body.</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.565" end="00:28:49.665" style="s2">So you take the mind/emotion integration</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.665" end="00:28:52.360" style="s2">and integrate that in your body. So what&#39;d that be?</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.360" end="00:28:53.720" style="s2">You act it out!</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.980" end="00:28:55.820" style="s2">Instead of just thinking.</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.820" end="00:28:58.660" style="s2">So, there&#39;s this philosophical idea called a...</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.900" end="00:29:03.180" style="s2">-- now I&#39;m gonna forget what it&#39;s called -- It&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.180" end="00:29:06.440" style="s2">contradiction in action! There&#39;s actually a technical term for it.</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.445" end="00:29:09.845" style="s2">But that&#39;s when you think and believe something but you don&#39;t act it out.</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.845" end="00:29:12.595" style="s2">And so, that means there&#39;s a dissociation  in you somehow</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.595" end="00:29:15.885" style="s2">between your abstract representations and</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.885" end="00:29:18.915" style="s2">what you manifest in action. Wel that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.915" end="00:29:22.215" style="s2">another form of discontinuity that isn&#39;t doing you any good.</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.220" end="00:29:24.980" style="s2">You know, the driver is going one way and the car is going the</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.980" end="00:29:28.720" style="s2">other. And you won&#39;t even be able to understand yourself, if you do that.</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.725" end="00:29:31.755" style="s2">But, even more, you&#39;re not putting your principles into practice.</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.755" end="00:29:35.175" style="s2">So, you&#39;re dissociated. Your being is dissociated. So...</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.175" end="00:29:38.175" style="s2">Once you get your mind and your emotions working together, then</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.180" end="00:29:40.740" style="s2">the next thing to do is to act that out consistenly.</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.740" end="00:29:44.375" style="s2">That was the second conjunction, as far as Jung was concerned, and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.375" end="00:29:46.885" style="s2">the third one was -- this is the tough one, and</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.885" end="00:29:48.995" style="s2">this is the one that&#39;s related to phenomenology --</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.135" end="00:29:53.345" style="s2">you erase the distinction between yourself and the world.</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.245" end="00:29:55.245" style="s2">OK.</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.555" end="00:29:56.725" style="s2">That&#39;s a tough one.</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.725" end="00:29:59.345" style="s2">So, imagine you&#39;re dealing with someone who&#39;s hoarding.</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.785" end="00:30:02.915" style="s2">Now, people who are hoarding are often older or</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.915" end="00:30:06.255" style="s2">neurologically damaged or they have obsessive compulsive disorder.</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.300" end="00:30:08.580" style="s2">But then, you walk into their house and there&#39;s like ten</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.580" end="00:30:11.780" style="s2">thousands things in their house. There&#39;s...there&#39;s...there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.780" end="00:30:15.360" style="s2">There&#39;s, maybe, a hundred boxes. And you open up a box and, in the box, there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.365" end="00:30:18.035" style="s2">pens and some old passports and some</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.035" end="00:30:21.025" style="s2">checks and... there&#39;s collections of silver dollars and</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.025" end="00:30:23.885" style="s2">some hypodermic needles and some dust and...</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.885" end="00:30:26.815" style="s2">you know, a dead mouse and...and...</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.815" end="00:30:29.405" style="s2">there&#39;s boxes and boxes and boxes. It&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.405" end="00:30:32.165" style="s2">that in the house. It&#39;s absolute chaos in there.</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.165" end="00:30:34.840" style="s2">Absolute chaos. Not order...chaos.</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.840" end="00:30:36.900" style="s2">And then, you think, is that their house or is that</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.900" end="00:30:40.455" style="s2">their being? Is that their mind? And the answer is :</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.455" end="00:30:43.425" style="s2">there&#39;s no difference. There&#39;s no difference.</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.425" end="00:30:46.005" style="s2">So, you know, I could say, well, if you want to organize your</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.005" end="00:30:49.015" style="s2">psyche, you could start by organizing your room...if that</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.020" end="00:30:50.860" style="s2">would be easier, cause, maybe, you&#39;re a more</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.860" end="00:30:53.140" style="s2">concrete person and you need something concrete to do.</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.440" end="00:30:55.880" style="s2">So...you go clean up under your bed and you</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.880" end="00:30:59.275" style="s2">make your bed and you organize the papers on your desk and you think, well...</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.280" end="00:31:01.680" style="s2">Just exactly what are you organizing? Are you</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.680" end="00:31:05.220" style="s2">organizing the objective world or are you objecting your field...</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.225" end="00:31:07.705" style="s2">are you organizing your field of being,</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.705" end="00:31:10.125" style="s2">like your field of total experience?</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.320" end="00:31:12.500" style="s2">And Jung believed that...and I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.500" end="00:31:14.760" style="s2">there&#39;s a Buddhist doctrine that&#39;s sort of nested in there,</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.760" end="00:31:18.320" style="s2">that, at the highest level of psychological integrration, there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.325" end="00:31:20.975" style="s2">no difference between you and what your experience.</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.980" end="00:31:23.560" style="s2">Now, you think, well,</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.560" end="00:31:26.820" style="s2">I can&#39;t control everything I experience. But that&#39;s no objection</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.825" end="00:31:29.695" style="s2">because you can&#39;t control yourself anyway, so the mere fact</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.695" end="00:31:32.765" style="s2">that you can&#39;t extend control over everything</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.765" end="00:31:34.660" style="s2">you experience is no argument against the</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.660" end="00:31:38.060" style="s2">idea that you should still treat that as an extension of yourself.</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.065" end="00:31:41.095" style="s2">Well, let&#39;s say that you have a longstanding</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.095" end="00:31:44.145" style="s2">feud with your brother. Well...</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.145" end="00:31:47.135" style="s2">Is that a psychological problem? Is that him?  Is it a</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.135" end="00:31:50.115" style="s2">problem in the objective world or is it a problem in your field</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.115" end="00:31:53.185" style="s2">of being? And it&#39;s very useful to think</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.185" end="00:31:55.560" style="s2">that way because you might ask what could you do to</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.560" end="00:31:58.620" style="s2">improve yourself? Well, let&#39;s step</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.620" end="00:32:01.900" style="s2">one step backwards. The first question might be why should you even bother</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.905" end="00:32:03.375" style="s2">improving yourself?</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.905" end="00:32:06.455" style="s2">And I think the answer to that is something like : so you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.455" end="00:32:09.665" style="s2">suffer any more stupidly than you have to.</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.905" end="00:32:12.745" style="s2">And, maybe, so others don&#39;t have to either. It&#39;s something like that.</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.745" end="00:32:15.945" style="s2">You know, like, there&#39;s a real injunction at the bottom of it. It&#39;s not some</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.945" end="00:32:19.165" style="s2">casual self-help doctrine, it&#39;s that if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.165" end="00:32:21.780" style="s2">organize yourself properly, you&#39;ll pay for</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.780" end="00:32:25.680" style="s2">it. And in a big way. And so will the people around you. Now...</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.795" end="00:32:28.715" style="s2">And, you could say, well, I don&#39;t care about that but that&#39;s actually not</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.715" end="00:32:31.675" style="s2">true. You actually do care about that. Because, if you&#39;re in pain,</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.675" end="00:32:34.565" style="s2">you will care about it. And so, you do care</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.565" end="00:32:37.545" style="s2">about it. Even if it&#39;s just that negative way, you know.</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.545" end="00:32:40.125" style="s2">It&#39;s very rare that you can find someone</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.125" end="00:32:42.565" style="s2">who&#39;s in excruciating pain who would ever say</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.205" end="00:32:46.215" style="s2">well, it would be no better if I was out of this.</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.215" end="00:32:49.235" style="s2">This sort of pain is one of those things that brings</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.235" end="00:32:52.445" style="s2">the idea that it would be better if it didn&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.445" end="00:32:54.625" style="s2">along with it. It&#39;s incontrovertible.</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.140" end="00:32:57.840" style="s2">So...You get your act together so that there</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.840" end="00:33:00.995" style="s2">isn&#39;t any more stupid pain around you than necessary.</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.000" end="00:33:03.480" style="s2">So then, the question might be: well, how would you go about getting</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.480" end="00:33:05.660" style="s2">your act together? And the answer to that</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.660" end="00:33:08.800" style="s2">-- and this is a phenomenological idea too -- it&#39;s something like:</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.855" end="00:33:11.845" style="s2">look around for something that bothers you</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.845" end="00:33:13.335" style="s2">and see if you can fix it.</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.995" end="00:33:15.945" style="s2">So...Now, you think, well</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.895" end="00:33:19.395" style="s2">let&#39;s say you go into a</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.500" end="00:33:22.100" style="s2">-- you can do this in a room. It&#39;s quite fun to do it just when</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.100" end="00:33:25.180" style="s2">you&#39;re sitting in a room, like, a room...maybe, your bedroom, you can sit there</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.180" end="00:33:28.580" style="s2">and then just sort of meditate on it, think, OK, if I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.855" end="00:33:31.725" style="s2">spend 10 minutes making this room better,</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.115" end="00:33:34.835" style="s2">what would I have to do? And you have to ask yourself that,</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.835" end="00:33:37.855" style="s2">right? It&#39;s not a command, it&#39;s like a genuine question. And things</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.860" end="00:33:40.520" style="s2">will pop out in the room that, you know, you...like...there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.520" end="00:33:43.875" style="s2">stack of papers over there that&#39;s kind of bugging you and you know that, maybe,</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.875" end="00:33:46.995" style="s2">a little order there would be a good thing and, you know you haven&#39;t...</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.165" end="00:33:50.245" style="s2">There&#39;s some rubbish behind your computer monitor that you haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.245" end="00:33:53.475" style="s2">attended to for, like, six months and...the room would be slightly better</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.480" end="00:33:56.080" style="s2">if it was a little less dusty and the cables weren&#39;t all</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.080" end="00:33:57.360" style="s2">tangled up the same way and...</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.435" end="00:33:59.735" style="s2">like, if you...if you allow</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.735" end="00:34:02.715" style="s2">yourself just to consider the</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.715" end="00:34:05.725" style="s2">expanse in which you exist at that moment,</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.725" end="00:34:08.340" style="s2">there&#39;ll be all sorts of things that will pop out in it, that</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.340" end="00:34:09.880" style="s2">you could just fix.</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.315" end="00:34:13.395" style="s2">And, you know, I might say, well, if you&#39;re coming to see me for</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.395" end="00:34:16.335" style="s2">psychotherapy, the easiest thing for us to do</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.340" end="00:34:18.920" style="s2">first would just be to get you to organize your room.</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.920" end="00:34:21.800" style="s2">You think, well, is that psychotherapy? And the answer is, well,</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.800" end="00:34:25.060" style="s2">it depends on how you conceive the limits of your</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.065" end="00:34:26.065" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.955" end="00:34:30.035" style="s2">And, I would say, start where you can start.</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.120" end="00:34:32.920" style="s2">You know, if something announces itself</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.920" end="00:34:35.540" style="s2">to you, which is a strange way of thinking about it,</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.540" end="00:34:38.820" style="s2">as in need of repair, that you could repair,</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.975" end="00:34:42.025" style="s2">then, hey! fix it! You fix a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.025" end="00:34:45.485" style="s2">things like that, your life will be a lot different.</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.160" end="00:34:48.720" style="s2">You know, I often tell people too, &quot;fix the things you</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.720" end="00:34:52.235" style="s2">repeat every day. Cause people tend to think of those as trivial.</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.235" end="00:34:55.015" style="s2">Right? You get up, you brush your teeth,</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.020" end="00:34:57.460" style="s2">you have your breakfast, you know, you have your</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.460" end="00:35:00.435" style="s2">routines that you go through everyday. Well, those...those probably</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.440" end="00:35:03.380" style="s2">constitute 50% of your life. And</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.380" end="00:35:06.360" style="s2">people think &quot;well, they&#39;re mundane, I don&#39;t need to pay attention to them&quot;, it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.365" end="00:35:09.035" style="s2">no, no, that&#39;s exactly wrong. The things you do every day,</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.445" end="00:35:11.625" style="s2">those are the most important things you do.</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.025" end="00:35:15.045" style="s2">Hands down. All you have to do is do the arithmetic.</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.045" end="00:35:17.045" style="s2">You figure it out right away.  So...</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.405" end="00:35:20.435" style="s2">A hundred adjustments to your...broader</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.435" end="00:35:23.345" style="s2">domain of being and there&#39;s a lot less</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.345" end="00:35:24.465" style="s2">rubbish and..</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.045" end="00:35:28.085" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot less rubbish around and a lot fewer traps for you</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.085" end="00:35:30.295" style="s2">to step into. And so...</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.965" end="00:35:33.585" style="s2">That&#39;s in keeping with Jung&#39;s idea about</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.000" end="00:35:36.520" style="s2">erasing the diss...once you&#39;ve got your mind and your</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.520" end="00:35:39.840" style="s2">emotions together and once you&#39;re acting that out, then</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.845" end="00:35:42.715" style="s2">you can extend what you&#39;re willing to</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.720" end="00:35:46.200" style="s2">consider yourself and start fixing up the things</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.680" end="00:35:49.175" style="s2">that are part of your broader extent. Now,</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.175" end="00:35:52.045" style="s2">sometimes, you don&#39;t know how to do that. So, you might say, imagine you&#39;re walking down</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.045" end="00:35:55.065" style="s2">Bloor Street and there&#39;s this guy who&#39;s, like, alcoholic</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.065" end="00:35:57.765" style="s2">and schizophrenic and he&#39;s been on the street for ten years.</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.765" end="00:36:00.835" style="s2">He sort of stumbles towards you and, you know, incoherently</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.835" end="00:36:03.235" style="s2">mutters something. That&#39;s a problem!</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.780" end="00:36:06.380" style="s2">And...it would be good if you could fix it but</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.380" end="00:36:08.520" style="s2">you haven&#39;t got a clue about how to fix THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.240" end="00:36:12.360" style="s2">You just walk around that and go find something that you could</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.365" end="00:36:15.035" style="s2">fix because, if you muck about in that,</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.040" end="00:36:17.340" style="s2">not only is it unlikely that&#39; you&#39;ll help that person, it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.340" end="00:36:20.420" style="s2">likely that you&#39;ll get hurt yourself. So...</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.425" end="00:36:23.445" style="s2">you know, just because, while your experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.445" end="00:36:26.535" style="s2">things announce themselves as in need of repair</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.535" end="00:36:29.525" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s you, right then and there, that</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.525" end="00:36:32.665" style="s2">should repair them. You have to have some humility, you know.</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.665" end="00:36:35.715" style="s2">You don&#39;t walk up to a helicopter that isn&#39;t working and just start</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.715" end="00:36:38.135" style="s2">tinkering away with it. You have to stay within</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.135" end="00:36:41.275" style="s2">your domain of competence. But, most of the time, when people look</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.275" end="00:36:43.315" style="s2">at their lives, you know....</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.825" end="00:36:46.955" style="s2">-- It&#39;s a very interesting thing to do. I like...I like</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.955" end="00:36:50.145" style="s2">the idea of the room because you can do that at the drop of a hat.</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.145" end="00:36:53.115" style="s2">You know, go back to where you live and sit down and think &quot;OK,</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.615" end="00:36:56.585" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna make this place better for half an hour. What should I</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.585" end="00:36:57.520" style="s2">do?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.520" end="00:36:59.260" style="s2">You have to ask.</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.475" end="00:37:02.635" style="s2">And...things will just pop up like mad. And it&#39;s partly</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.635" end="00:37:05.685" style="s2">because your mind is a very strange thing. As soon as you give it an aim,</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.685" end="00:37:08.400" style="s2">a genuine aim, it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.400" end="00:37:11.300" style="s2">reconfigure the world in keeping with that aim. That&#39;s, that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.300" end="00:37:14.160" style="s2">actually how you see, to begin with. And so, if you</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.160" end="00:37:17.040" style="s2">set it a task, espec... -- you have to be genuine about it,</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.040" end="00:37:18.880" style="s2">which is why you have to bring your</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.435" end="00:37:22.175" style="s2">thoughts and emotions together and then, you have to get them in</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.175" end="00:37:24.875" style="s2">your body, so you&#39;re acting consistently. You have to</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.875" end="00:37:27.685" style="s2">be genuine about the aim - But once you aim, the</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.685" end="00:37:30.555" style="s2">world will reconfigure itself around that aim,</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.555" end="00:37:33.635" style="s2">which is very strange. And...and... it&#39;s...</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.635" end="00:37:36.435" style="s2">it&#39;s..it&#39;s technically true.</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.485" end="00:37:38.235" style="s2">You know, the best example of that</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.985" end="00:37:42.095" style="s2">-- you&#39;ve all seen this video where you...watch the</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.095" end="00:37:44.745" style="s2">basket ball being tossed back and forth</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.745" end="00:37:47.505" style="s2">between members of the white team versus the black</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.505" end="00:37:49.880" style="s2">team and, while you&#39;re doing that, a gorilla</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.880" end="00:37:52.880" style="s2">walks up into the middle of the video and you don&#39;t see it. It&#39;s like...</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.925" end="00:37:55.885" style="s2">-- you know, if you thought about that experiment for about five</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.885" end="00:37:58.925" style="s2">years, that would be about the right amount of time to spend thinking about it.</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.925" end="00:38:01.945" style="s2">Because, what it shows yo isthat you see what you aim at.</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.020" end="00:38:04.980" style="s2">And that, man, if you can get one thing through your</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.980" end="00:38:07.975" style="s2">head as a consequence of even being in University,</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.975" end="00:38:10.645" style="s2">that would be a good one: you see what you aim at.</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.645" end="00:38:12.545" style="s2">And so, because...one...</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.860" end="00:38:16.620" style="s2">inference you might draw from that is... be careful what</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.620" end="00:38:17.940" style="s2">you aimt at!</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.955" end="00:38:21.065" style="s2">Right? What you aim at determines the</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.065" end="00:38:24.065" style="s2">way the world manifests itself to you. And so, if the world is</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.065" end="00:38:25.860" style="s2">manifesting itself in a...</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.920" end="00:38:29.035" style="s2">very negative way, one thing to ask</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.035" end="00:38:31.665" style="s2">is: are you aiming at the right thing? Now...</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.665" end="00:38:34.645" style="s2">you know, I&#39;m not trying to reduce everybody&#39;s problems to</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.045" end="00:38:37.885" style="s2">an improper aim. People get cut off at the knees for all</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.885" end="00:38:41.005" style="s2">sorts of reasons, you know. They get sick, they have accidents,</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.005" end="00:38:44.245" style="s2">There&#39;s a random element to being, that&#39;s for sure. But</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.245" end="00:38:47.175" style="s2">-- and so, you don&#39;t want to take anything, even that particular</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.175" end="00:38:50.175" style="s2">phrase too far. You want to bind it with the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.245" end="00:38:53.425" style="s2">random things do happen to people. But it&#39;s still a great thing to</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.425" end="00:38:56.120" style="s2">ask.-- OK, so, Rogers was a</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.120" end="00:38:59.395" style="s2">phenomenologist. He was interested in...he didn&#39;t start</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.395" end="00:39:02.615" style="s2">his philosophy from the perspective of</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.615" end="00:39:05.645" style="s2">subject versus object or from the idea of psyche,</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.645" end="00:39:08.645" style="s2">like, sort of inside you, your mind</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.645" end="00:39:09.845" style="s2">with it&#39;s layers.</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.345" end="00:39:12.705" style="s2">That&#39;s not how it looked at it. And so,</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.865" end="00:39:14.345" style="s2">let&#39;s go through...</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.405" end="00:39:18.355" style="s2">(now...) I&#39;ll introduce you to Rogers. I think that...</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.355" end="00:39:21.345" style="s2">then we&#39;ll talk more about him next time. I&#39;m gonna start though,</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.345" end="00:39:24.295" style="s2">with something that I learned from him that  I think was of</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.300" end="00:39:27.020" style="s2">crucial importance. And so, we&#39;ll set the stage for the</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.020" end="00:39:30.960" style="s2">further discussion with this. And I&#39;m gonna read it to you.</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.660" end="00:39:34.555" style="s2">ROGERS : &quot;Assuming a minimal mutual willingness to be in</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.555" end="00:39:37.445" style="s2">contact and to receive communications, we may say that</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.445" end="00:39:40.115" style="s2">the greater the communicated congruence</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.115" end="00:39:41.425" style="s2">of experience,</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.005" end="00:39:45.015" style="s2">awareness and behaviour on the part of</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.015" end="00:39:48.045" style="s2">one individual, the more the ensuing relationship will involve</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.045" end="00:39:50.985" style="s2">a tendency towards reciprocal communication with the same</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.985" end="00:39:53.335" style="s2">qualities. Mutually accurate</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.335" end="00:39:56.535" style="s2">understanding of the communications, improved psychological adjustments</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.535" end="00:39:58.895" style="s2">and functioning in both parties, and mutual</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.895" end="00:40:00.395" style="s2">satisfaction in the relationship.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.980" end="00:40:02.160" style="s2">It&#39;s quite a mouthful.</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.560" end="00:40:04.060" style="s2">What does it mean?</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.060" end="00:40:07.340" style="s2">&quot;Assuming a minimal mutual willingness to be in contact</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.340" end="00:40:10.740" style="s2">and to receive communications.&quot; Okay, we are having a conversation.</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.740" end="00:40:13.500" style="s2">I&#39;m deciding I&#39;m going to listen to you.</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.580" end="00:40:14.540" style="s2">Right,</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.540" end="00:40:16.040" style="s2">That&#39;s different than how people</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.040" end="00:40:16.940" style="s2">generally</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.060" end="00:40:20.040" style="s2">communicate, because usually when they communicate,</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.040" end="00:40:22.995" style="s2">they&#39;re doing something like: Okay</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.995" end="00:40:26.065" style="s2">We&#39;re going to have a conversation, and I&#39;m going to tell you why I&#39;m right,</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.065" end="00:40:27.755" style="s2">and I&#39;ll win if you agree</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.175" end="00:40:30.785" style="s2">or maybe you&#39;re having a conversation where</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.785" end="00:40:33.615" style="s2">i don&#39;t know what your trying to do, maybe your trying to impress the person</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.615" end="00:40:36.675" style="s2">you&#39;re talking to, so you&#39;re not listening to them at all, you&#39;re just thinking about  what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.795" end="00:40:39.965" style="s2">going to say next. Okay, so that&#39;s Not This.</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.965" end="00:40:42.785" style="s2">This Is: You might have something to tell me.</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.325" end="00:40:46.335" style="s2">And So, I&#39;m going to Listen On the off chance</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.335" end="00:40:49.385" style="s2">that you&#39;ll tell me something that would really  be useful for me to know.</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.385" end="00:40:51.925" style="s2">and so, you can think about it as an</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.925" end="00:40:53.885" style="s2">extension of the Piagetian...</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.000" end="00:40:57.420" style="s2">you know Piaget talked about the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.280" end="00:41:00.560" style="s2">The fundamentally  important element of knowledge being</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.560" end="00:41:02.680" style="s2">to describe how knowledge is sought.</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.680" end="00:41:05.380" style="s2">The process by which knowledge is generated. Well,</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.560" end="00:41:08.660" style="s2">if you agree with me and I find that out,</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.660" end="00:41:12.015" style="s2">I know nothing more than I knew before. I just know what I knew before.</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.015" end="00:41:14.375" style="s2">And, maybe, I&#39;m happy about that because, you know, it didn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.375" end="00:41:17.595" style="s2">challenged. But I&#39;m no smarter than I was before.</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.635" end="00:41:18.855" style="s2">But, maybe, you&#39;re different than</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.855" end="00:41:21.945" style="s2">me and so, while I&#39;m  listening to you, you&#39;ll tell me something I would...</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.945" end="00:41:24.700" style="s2">I don&#39;t like. Maybe, it&#39;s something I find contemptible...</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.700" end="00:41:28.035" style="s2">or difficult, whatever. Maybe you&#39;ll find...you&#39;ll tell me something</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.040" end="00:41:31.080" style="s2">I don&#39;t know. And then, I won&#39;t be quite as stupid. And then,</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.080" end="00:41:34.860" style="s2">maybe,  I won&#39;t run painfully into quite as many things.</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.015" end="00:41:37.735" style="s2">And that&#39;s a really useful thing to know, especially if you live</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.740" end="00:41:40.240" style="s2">with someone and you&#39;re trying to make long-term</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.240" end="00:41:42.600" style="s2">peace with them and they&#39;re not the same as you.</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.035" end="00:41:46.105" style="s2">And their way they look at the world and the facts that they pull out of the world</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.105" end="00:41:48.425" style="s2">aren&#39;t the same as your facts. And...</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.680" end="00:41:51.280" style="s2">even though you&#39;re going to be overwhelmed with the</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.280" end="00:41:54.160" style="s2">procilvity to demonstrate that you&#39;re right,</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.160" end="00:41:56.800" style="s2">it is the case that two brains are better than one.</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.375" end="00:42:00.005" style="s2">And so, maybe, nine of the ten</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.005" end="00:42:02.455" style="s2">things they tell you are dispensable,</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.460" end="00:42:05.040" style="s2">or, maybe, even 49 out of 50. But</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.040" end="00:42:08.195" style="s2">one thing...all you need to get out of the damn conversations is</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.195" end="00:42:11.145" style="s2">one thing you don&#39;t know. And one of the things that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.145" end="00:42:13.915" style="s2">cool about a good psychotherapeutic</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.915" end="00:42:17.015" style="s2">session is that the whole conversation is like that.</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.655" end="00:42:19.525" style="s2">All you&#39;re doing is trying to...</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.255" end="00:42:23.235" style="s2">express the truth of the situation</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.235" end="00:42:26.565" style="s2">as clearly as possible. That&#39;s it!</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.055" end="00:42:28.095" style="s2">And so...</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.735" end="00:42:32.015" style="s2">Now, Rodgers&#39; proposition</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.455" end="00:42:35.615" style="s2">-- and I&#39;ll tell you why he derived it -- was that,</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.615" end="00:42:38.385" style="s2">if you have a conversation like that with someone,</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.385" end="00:42:40.955" style="s2">it will make both of you better.</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.955" end="00:42:43.715" style="s2">It will make both of you psychologically healthier.</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.715" end="00:42:46.855" style="s2">So, there&#39;s an implicit presupposition that the exchange</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.855" end="00:42:49.885" style="s2">of truth is curative. Well, that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.885" end="00:42:52.845" style="s2">a very cool idea. I mean, it&#39;s a very deep idea.</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.845" end="00:42:55.705" style="s2">I think it&#39;s the most profound idea...</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.965" end="00:42:58.565" style="s2">It&#39;s the idea upon western civil...</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.565" end="00:43:01.215" style="s2">upon which western civilization -- although not</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.215" end="00:43:04.135" style="s2">only western civilization -- is actually predicated.</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.135" end="00:43:07.075" style="s2">The idea that truth produces health. But for</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.075" end="00:43:10.235" style="s2">Rogers, that was the entire purpose of the psychotherapeutic alliance.</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.235" end="00:43:13.315" style="s2">You  come to see me because you want to be better.</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.095" end="00:43:17.115" style="s2">You don&#39;t even know what that means, necessarily. Neither do I.</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.115" end="00:43:20.185" style="s2">We&#39;re gonna figure that out together. But you come and you say</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.185" end="00:43:23.195" style="s2">&quot;Look, things are not acceptable to me and</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.200" end="00:43:25.380" style="s2">maybe, there&#39;s something I could do about that&quot;. So</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.380" end="00:43:28.460" style="s2">that&#39;s the minimal precondition to engage in therapy.</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.545" end="00:43:31.575" style="s2">Something&#39;s wrong. You&#39;re willing to talk about it truthfuly</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.575" end="00:43:34.905" style="s2">and you want it to be better. WIthout that, the therapeutic</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.095" end="00:43:37.755" style="s2">relationship does not get off the ground.</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.755" end="00:43:40.815" style="s2">And so, then, you might ask: well what relationships are therapeutic?</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.835" end="00:43:43.935" style="s2">And the answer to that will be: if you have a real relationship,</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.940" end="00:43:45.320" style="s2">it&#39;s therapeutic.</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.340" end="00:43:48.520" style="s2">If it isn&#39;t, what you have is not a relationship. God only</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.525" end="00:43:51.545" style="s2">knows what you have. You&#39;re a slave, they&#39;re a tyrant.</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.545" end="00:43:54.505" style="s2">You know, you&#39;re both butting heads with one another. It&#39;s a primate</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.505" end="00:43:57.505" style="s2">dominance hierarchy dispute or,</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.505" end="00:44:00.525" style="s2">I don&#39;t know, you&#39;re like two cats in a barrel or two people with their hands around</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.525" end="00:44:03.205" style="s2">each other&#39;s throats. But what you have is not a</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.205" end="00:44:05.265" style="s2">relationship. So...</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.795" end="00:44:08.365" style="s2">All right. ROGERS &quot;We may say that the greater the</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.365" end="00:44:11.265" style="s2">communicated congruence of experience, awareness and behaviour on the</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.265" end="00:44:14.365" style="s2">part of one individual&quot;...PETERSON That&#39;s a reference to the same idea</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.365" end="00:44:17.395" style="s2">that I was describing, with regards to Jung. so...</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.395" end="00:44:18.395" style="s2">Let&#39;s say,</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.785" end="00:44:21.885" style="s2">you come and talk to me and you want things do go well. Well, I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.885" end="00:44:24.800" style="s2">have to more or less be one thing. Because, <br /> if I&#39;m all over the</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.800" end="00:44:26.155" style="s2">place,</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.160" end="00:44:28.760" style="s2">you can&#39;t trust any continuity in what I</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.760" end="00:44:30.980" style="s2">say. There&#39;s no....and...you</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.985" end="00:44:33.295" style="s2">There&#39;s no reason for you to believe that I&#39;m capable</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.295" end="00:44:34.695" style="s2">of actually telling you...</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.175" end="00:44:37.945" style="s2">...I&#39;m capable of expressing anything that&#39;s true.</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.115" end="00:44:40.915" style="s2">So, the truth is something that emerges as a consequence</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.915" end="00:44:44.165" style="s2">of getting yourself lined up...and beating all the...</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.485" end="00:44:46.665" style="s2">-- what would you call? --</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.205" end="00:44:51.155" style="s2">...all the impurities out of your...out of your...</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.455" end="00:44:52.455" style="s2">out of your....</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.635" end="00:44:55.445" style="s2">soul, for lack of a better word.</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.585" end="00:44:58.655" style="s2">You have to be integrated for that to happen. And you do that, at least in</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.655" end="00:45:02.065" style="s2">part, by wanting to tell the truth. ROGERS &quot;...the more the ensuing</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.065" end="00:45:04.715" style="s2">relationship wil involve a tendency towards</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.715" end="00:45:07.955" style="s2">reciprocal communication with the same qualities....&quot; PETERSON : So, one of</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.955" end="00:45:10.895" style="s2">the things -- &#39;cause I&#39;ve been quite influenced by Rogers --</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.895" end="00:45:13.805" style="s2">One of the things I try to do in my therapeutic sessions is,  first of all,</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.805" end="00:45:16.705" style="s2">to listen, to really listen. And then,</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.705" end="00:45:19.285" style="s2">while I listen, I watch. And while</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.285" end="00:45:21.895" style="s2">I&#39;m listening, things will happen in my head.</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.385" end="00:45:25.165" style="s2">You know, maybe, I&#39;ll get a litte image of something or</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.165" end="00:45:27.900" style="s2">I&#39;ll get a thought or a question will emerge and I&#39;ll just tell the</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.900" end="00:45:29.860" style="s2">person what that is. But it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.860" end="00:45:32.460" style="s2">directionless, you know. It&#39;s not like I have a goal</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.460" end="00:45:35.300" style="s2">-- except that we&#39;re trying to make things better -- I&#39;m on the side</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.300" end="00:45:37.920" style="s2">of the person...I&#39;m on the side of the part of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.925" end="00:45:41.175" style="s2">person that wants things to be better, not worse.</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.405" end="00:45:44.405" style="s2">And so, then, those parts of us have a dialogue and</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.405" end="00:45:47.405" style="s2">the consequence of that dialogue is that certain things take place.</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.405" end="00:45:50.315" style="s2">And then, I&#39;ll just tell the person what happened. And it isn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.315" end="00:45:51.435" style="s2">I&#39;m right.</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.865" end="00:45:54.895" style="s2">That&#39;s not the point The point of this is that, they get to have an hour</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.895" end="00:45:57.955" style="s2">with someone who actually tells them what they think.</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.185" end="00:46:00.045" style="s2">Here&#39;s the impact you&#39;re having on me.</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.355" end="00:46:03.335" style="s2">You know...This is making me angry. This is making me</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.340" end="00:46:05.200" style="s2">happy. This is really interesting. This</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.200" end="00:46:08.900" style="s2">reminds me of something that you said an hour ago that I  don&#39;t quite understand.</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.285" end="00:46:10.285" style="s2">And the whole...</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.635" end="00:46:13.245" style="s2">the whole point is not, for either</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.245" end="00:46:16.205" style="s2">person to make the propositon or convince</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.205" end="00:46:19.395" style="s2">the other that their position is correct, but merely to</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.395" end="00:46:22.185" style="s2">have an exchange of experience</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.185" end="00:46:24.720" style="s2">about how things are set up.</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.820" end="00:46:27.940" style="s2">And it&#39;s extraordinarily useful for people because it&#39;s often difficult</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.940" end="00:46:31.460" style="s2">for anyone to find anyone to talk to that will actually listen.</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.825" end="00:46:34.905" style="s2">And so...another thing that&#39;s really strange about this listening</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.905" end="00:46:38.015" style="s2">is that, if you really listen to people, they will tell you the weirdest bloody things</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.020" end="00:46:40.600" style="s2">so fast you just cannot believe it. So,</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.600" end="00:46:43.955" style="s2">if you&#39;re having a conversation with someone and it&#39;s dull, it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.955" end="00:46:46.945" style="s2">you&#39;re stupid. That&#39;s why. You&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.945" end="00:46:49.915" style="s2">listening to them properly. Because they&#39;re weird. They&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.185" end="00:46:53.585" style="s2">wombats or albatrosses or rhinoceroses or something,</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.585" end="00:46:56.605" style="s2">like, they&#39;re strange creatures. And so if you were actually</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.605" end="00:46:59.815" style="s2">communicating with them and they were telling you how weird they really are,</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.925" end="00:47:02.865" style="s2">it would be...it would be anything but boring.</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.265" end="00:47:06.265" style="s2">So.... And you can ask questions, that&#39;s a really good</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.265" end="00:47:09.085" style="s2">way of listening. But, you know... one of</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.085" end="00:47:12.375" style="s2">Rogers&#39; point is that, well,  you have to orientate properly in order to listen.</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.375" end="00:47:13.955" style="s2">And the orientation has to be:</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.955" end="00:47:16.325" style="s2">look, what I want out of this conversation is</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.325" end="00:47:19.245" style="s2">that the place we both end up is better than the place we left.</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.295" end="00:47:20.215" style="s2">That&#39;s it!</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.215" end="00:47:23.315" style="s2">That&#39;s what I&#39;m after. And, if you&#39;re not after that, you gotta think:</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.315" end="00:47:26.325" style="s2">why the hell wouldn&#39;t you be after that? What could you</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.325" end="00:47:29.275" style="s2">possibly be after that would be better than that?</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.275" end="00:47:32.265" style="s2">You walk away smarter and more well equipped for</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.265" end="00:47:35.465" style="s2">the world than you were before you had the conversation.</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.465" end="00:47:38.280" style="s2">And so does the other person. Well, maybe, if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.280" end="00:47:41.535" style="s2">bitter and resentful and angry and anxious and, you know,</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.535" end="00:47:44.205" style="s2">generally annoyed at the world, then,</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.205" end="00:47:47.075" style="s2">that isn&#39;t what you want. You want the other person  to walk away</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.075" end="00:47:50.425" style="s2">worse, and you too, cause you&#39;re full of revenge. But...you know...</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.965" end="00:47:54.245" style="s2">You&#39;ll get what you want, if you do that. So...</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.975" end="00:47:57.935" style="s2">ROGERS &quot;We know from our research that such empathic</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.935" end="00:48:00.885" style="s2">understanding...&quot; PETERSON: It&#39;s already defined, that. I want to hear you,</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.885" end="00:48:04.325" style="s2">I want to hear what you have to say, so we can clarify it and move forward.</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.475" end="00:48:07.845" style="s2">I want to have your best interest in mind...And mine as well...but...</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.855" end="00:48:10.905" style="s2">you know...both at the same time. Your family&#39;s too, if we</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.905" end="00:48:14.105" style="s2">can manage that. We&#39;re after making things better.</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.435" end="00:48:17.625" style="s2">ROGERS: &quot;We know from our reserach that such emphatic understanding</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.625" end="00:48:20.395" style="s2">-- understanding with a person, not about them -- is such an</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.395" end="00:48:23.215" style="s2">effective approach that it can bring about major changes in personality.</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.215" end="00:48:26.185" style="s2">Some of you may be feeling that you listen well</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.185" end="00:48:29.125" style="s2">to people and that you have never seen such results. The chances are</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.125" end="00:48:31.595" style="s2">very great that you have not been listening</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.595" end="00:48:34.375" style="s2">in the manner that I have described. Fortunately, I can suggest</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.375" end="00:48:37.315" style="s2">a little experiment that you can do to test the quality of our understanding.</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.315" end="00:48:40.655" style="s2">the quality of our understanding. The next time you get into an argument</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.655" end="00:48:43.335" style="s2">with your wife, or your friend, or a small group of friends, stop</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.335" end="00:48:46.245" style="s2">the discussion for a moment and, for an experiment, institute</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.245" end="00:48:47.285" style="s2">this rule.</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.755" end="00:48:50.895" style="s2">Each person can speak up for himself only</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.895" end="00:48:54.155" style="s2">after he has first restated the ideas and feelings</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.155" end="00:48:56.565" style="s2">of the previous speaker accurately.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.565" end="00:48:58.545" style="s2">PETERSON: What &quot;accurately&quot; means is they have to</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.545" end="00:49:01.645" style="s2">agree with your restatement. Now, that&#39;s an annoying</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.645" end="00:49:04.420" style="s2">thing to do! Because, if someone is talking to you and you</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.420" end="00:49:07.180" style="s2">disagree with them, the first thing you wanna do is take their argument and make it</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.180" end="00:49:10.240" style="s2">the stupidest possible thing out of it that you can</p>
