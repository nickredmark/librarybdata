<p begin="00:00:02.700" end="00:00:07.319" style="s2">I hope you met a couple of more people</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.520" end="00:00:09.690" style="s2">that you hadn&#39;t seen before</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.319" end="00:00:11.340" style="s2">and slightly awkward in this face</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.690" end="00:00:13.920" style="s2">because I really can&#39;t see you I&#39;m kind</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.340" end="00:00:17.670" style="s2">of looking into the light but which</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.920" end="00:00:21.270" style="s2">might be a good thing so my presentation</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.670" end="00:00:23.820" style="s2">is a pretty heavy title holes dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.270" end="00:00:26.580" style="s2">hole systems design how can we weave</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.820" end="00:00:28.680" style="s2">ecosystems of collaboration and as you</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.580" end="00:00:30.150" style="s2">can imagine I could easily talk about</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.680" end="00:00:33.780" style="s2">this for a couple of hours or a couple</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.150" end="00:00:38.550" style="s2">of days so I&#39;m just gonna give you some</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.780" end="00:00:43.739" style="s2">snippets some a feeling for what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.550" end="00:00:47.129" style="s2">by this we all know that we live in an</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.739" end="00:00:50.879" style="s2">extremely complex ending world that</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.129" end="00:00:53.899" style="s2">we&#39;re facing a complexity that we might</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.879" end="00:00:55.860" style="s2">not be fully prepared for yet and</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.899" end="00:00:58.320" style="s2">mathematically speaking in the world of</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.860" end="00:01:00.930" style="s2">complexity when you look into what that</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.320" end="00:01:03.809" style="s2">actually is it&#39;s any system with more</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.930" end="00:01:06.780" style="s2">than three interacting variables is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.809" end="00:01:09.630" style="s2">complex dynamic system and these systems</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.780" end="00:01:12.450" style="s2">are fundamentally unpredictable and</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.630" end="00:01:15.689" style="s2">uncontrollable so we have to learn to</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.450" end="00:01:18.659" style="s2">dance with this complexity and stop</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.689" end="00:01:20.369" style="s2">trying to control things this slide is</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.659" end="00:01:22.500" style="s2">from a colleague of mine from the</p>

<p begin="00:01:22.500" end="00:01:27.060" style="s2">from 2002 and if you can read it&#39;s a bit</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.560" end="00:01:30.780" style="s2">of a small screen but if you can read</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.060" end="00:01:33.210" style="s2">what&#39;s on these little arrows these</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.780" end="00:01:37.020" style="s2">issues existed in 2002 and they even</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.210" end="00:01:40.380" style="s2">more pressing now I&#39;m going to try to</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.020" end="00:01:42.479" style="s2">keep the bad news as short as possible</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.380" end="00:01:45.229" style="s2">but I think it&#39;s summarized in those</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.479" end="00:01:48.420" style="s2">four slides or those four images and</p>

<p begin="00:01:51.119" end="00:01:54.720" style="s2">comes from a paper from the Stockholm</p>

<p begin="00:01:54.720" end="00:02:02.009" style="s2">August and it&#39;s called something climate</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.950" end="00:02:04.439" style="s2">change in the Anthropocene and basically</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.009" end="00:02:06.540" style="s2">it says that we are at a point where</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.439" end="00:02:10.470" style="s2">we&#39;ve destabilized the global climate</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.540" end="00:02:11.849" style="s2">system to a degree that we&#39;re now in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.470" end="00:02:12.810" style="s2">beginning of what&#39;s called runaway</p>

<p begin="00:02:18.060" end="00:02:25.049" style="s2">where the possibility to move back will</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.140" end="00:02:27.799" style="s2">soon not be an option anymore so we</p>

<p begin="00:02:29.989" end="00:02:35.129" style="s2">has recently said that we&#39;ve got a year</p>

<p begin="00:02:47.160" end="00:02:52.260" style="s2">basically all about water use energy use</p>

<p begin="00:02:52.260" end="00:02:56.730" style="s2">in the world like basically everything</p>

<p begin="00:03:45.540" end="00:03:49.349" style="s2">viable society so it&#39;s not just about</p>

<p begin="00:03:51.750" end="00:03:58.410" style="s2">bottom is from a report that credit</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.980" end="00:04:01.340" style="s2">Swiss gives out every two years it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.410" end="00:04:03.870" style="s2">called the Global Wealth Report and</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.340" end="00:04:07.340" style="s2">basically we now live in a world where</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.870" end="00:04:11.760" style="s2">eight point six percent of humanity hold</p>

<p begin="00:04:30.610" end="00:04:35.229" style="s2">that is that unequal and would we want</p>

<p begin="00:07:15.100" end="00:07:18.820" style="s2">goal rather than as part of a</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.020" end="00:07:21.390" style="s2">dysfunctional economic system that we</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.820" end="00:07:24.250" style="s2">need to fundamentally transform and</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.390" end="00:07:27.400" style="s2">sabotages all the other ones yes that</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.250" end="00:07:29.770" style="s2">might be true so we need to reframe that</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.400" end="00:07:34.090" style="s2">economic growth to may be qualitative</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.770" end="00:07:36.460" style="s2">growth but rather than dismissing the</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.090" end="00:07:39.340" style="s2">SDGs altogether I would invite you to</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.460" end="00:07:42.220" style="s2">understand them as a platform of</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.340" end="00:07:45.210" style="s2">conversation that for the first time is</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.220" end="00:07:48.760" style="s2">bringing supranational and national</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.210" end="00:07:50.730" style="s2">support to a local level so you can</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.760" end="00:07:54.070" style="s2">actually have the conversation around</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.730" end="00:07:55.810" style="s2">how are these goals relevant to us here</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.070" end="00:07:59.919" style="s2">in Merseyside or wherever you come from</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.810" end="00:08:02.770" style="s2">and how can we somewhat counter co-opt</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.919" end="00:08:04.360" style="s2">them using the fact that they&#39;re now in</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.770" end="00:08:06.760" style="s2">national plans and there is</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.360" end="00:08:09.730" style="s2">international funding to it for</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.760" end="00:08:13.870" style="s2">implementation to make them meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.730" end="00:08:16.180" style="s2">to us and I work part time for an</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.870" end="00:08:17.680" style="s2">organization called Gaia education and I</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.180" end="00:08:20.440" style="s2">actually designed the cards that you</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.680" end="00:08:22.180" style="s2">were just using and basically that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.440" end="00:08:25.510" style="s2">what they&#39;re what they are they&#39;re our</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.180" end="00:08:27.400" style="s2">facilitation tool where you can start</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.510" end="00:08:31.180" style="s2">conversations with people in your</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.400" end="00:08:33.969" style="s2">community around how to implement the</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.180" end="00:08:37.800" style="s2">SDGs in ways that are meaningful to your</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.969" end="00:08:40.030" style="s2">community and it comes together with a</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.800" end="00:08:43.870" style="s2">manual which is called the multipliers</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.030" end="00:08:45.490" style="s2">manual we run a one-day or a half like</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.870" end="00:08:47.860" style="s2">there&#39;s two versions a half-day and a</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.490" end="00:08:49.340" style="s2">full-day training called the training of</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.860" end="00:08:54.110" style="s2">multipliers</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.340" end="00:08:57.680" style="s2">and the manual details minute-by-minute</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.110" end="00:09:00.560" style="s2">a kind of facilitator script on how to</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.680" end="00:09:03.350" style="s2">run this workshop so you can choose</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.560" end="00:09:04.760" style="s2">whether you want to first do one that</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.350" end="00:09:06.589" style="s2">guy education offer somewhere in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.760" end="00:09:08.630" style="s2">world you can bring them here and and</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.589" end="00:09:10.339" style="s2">and have them run one but if you just</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.630" end="00:09:12.800" style="s2">want to run with it yourself you just</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.339" end="00:09:16.850" style="s2">download the black and white version of</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.800" end="00:09:18.920" style="s2">them the multipliers handbook and if you</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.850" end="00:09:21.290" style="s2">have any basic skills as a group</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.920" end="00:09:23.600" style="s2">facilitator and organizer you&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.290" end="00:09:25.220" style="s2">that it&#39;s it&#39;s very self-explanatory so</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.600" end="00:09:28.070" style="s2">all you need is a set of these cards and</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.220" end="00:09:31.160" style="s2">you&#39;re off and basically the different</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.070" end="00:09:32.990" style="s2">steps will show you first then make</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.160" end="00:09:35.779" style="s2">people familiar with the stds then they</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.990" end="00:09:38.420" style="s2">look at mapping what&#39;s already happening</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.779" end="00:09:40.790" style="s2">in my community that might not be framed</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.420" end="00:09:44.600" style="s2">under an SDG but if if i do a local</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.790" end="00:09:47.510" style="s2">water project on cleaning up polluted</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.600" end="00:09:50.180" style="s2">waters or giving people access to better</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.510" end="00:09:53.510" style="s2">drinking water then that&#39;s already a</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.180" end="00:09:56.990" style="s2">project working on an SD g and then you</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.510" end="00:09:59.450" style="s2">identify the the low-hanging fruits in</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.990" end="00:10:02.000" style="s2">your community where you can do big</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.450" end="00:10:04.460" style="s2">changes and then you identify where</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.000" end="00:10:07.370" style="s2">there&#39;s missing gaps and in in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.460" end="00:10:08.630" style="s2">bottom left corner is some of you might</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.370" end="00:10:11.720" style="s2">be familiar with the business model</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.630" end="00:10:13.010" style="s2">canvas this is this is a kind of SDG</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.720" end="00:10:15.620" style="s2">version of the business model canvas</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.010" end="00:10:16.940" style="s2">it&#39;s another step in a facilitation</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.620" end="00:10:19.100" style="s2">process where once people have</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.940" end="00:10:20.900" style="s2">identified a project that ideally</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.100" end="00:10:22.610" style="s2">addresses three or four of the SDGs</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.900" end="00:10:27.560" style="s2">together because they have to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.610" end="00:10:29.960" style="s2">addressed together and then this step in</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.560" end="00:10:33.170" style="s2">the workshop helps you to deepen in into</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.960" end="00:10:35.540" style="s2">that and in general guide ucation does a</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.170" end="00:10:37.610" style="s2">lot of capacity-building all around the</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.540" end="00:10:39.620" style="s2">world we have partners over a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.610" end="00:10:41.740" style="s2">partners in 52 countries around the</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.620" end="00:10:46.270" style="s2">world on all the continents ba</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.740" end="00:10:49.339" style="s2">Antarctica and we haven&#39;t face-to-face</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.270" end="00:10:51.500" style="s2">125 our course which is was initially</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.339" end="00:10:54.290" style="s2">called eco village design education but</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.500" end="00:10:56.060" style="s2">it&#39;s really about building sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.290" end="00:10:58.130" style="s2">communities so it&#39;s also very relevant</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.060" end="00:11:01.350" style="s2">for people in a transition town movement</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.130" end="00:11:05.010" style="s2">or who just wanted to neighborhood work</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.350" end="00:11:07.590" style="s2">then there&#39;s a 400 hour online course</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.010" end="00:11:09.690" style="s2">called design for sustainability and if</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.590" end="00:11:12.810" style="s2">you just at that point in in your work</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.690" end="00:11:15.990" style="s2">where you feel actually everything has</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.810" end="00:11:19.620" style="s2">to be sustainable because no matter what</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.990" end="00:11:21.930" style="s2">our future will bring if if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.620" end="00:11:24.330" style="s2">make it sustainable or regenerative then</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.930" end="00:11:27.240" style="s2">it will not last into the distant future</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.330" end="00:11:30.120" style="s2">but you feel you still need to brush up</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.240" end="00:11:32.880" style="s2">on a whole system&#39;s perspective of what</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.120" end="00:11:35.880" style="s2">that actually means that causes is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.880" end="00:11:38.190" style="s2">great opportunity to do so and and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.880" end="00:11:41.610" style="s2">we also run lots of project-based</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.190" end="00:11:45.240" style="s2">learning works in Bangladesh in Senegal</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.610" end="00:11:46.710" style="s2">in favelas in Brazil where people apply</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.240" end="00:11:49.800" style="s2">there&#39;s kind of whole system&#39;s thinking</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.710" end="00:11:51.030" style="s2">of sustainability and the phrase that</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.800" end="00:11:53.370" style="s2">I&#39;ve got there at the bottom is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.030" end="00:11:56.610" style="s2">really when you work in a systemic way</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.370" end="00:11:58.980" style="s2">then you stop thinking that&#39;s my problem</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.610" end="00:12:00.960" style="s2">how do I solve it the first question is</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.980" end="00:12:04.440" style="s2">give me at least five or six more</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.960" end="00:12:06.150" style="s2">problems and then you look at what kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.440" end="00:12:09.120" style="s2">of project can I build that would solve</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.150" end="00:12:11.790" style="s2">all of them at once because it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.120" end="00:12:12.900" style="s2">siloed thinking even in trying to create</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.790" end="00:12:14.820" style="s2">solutions to things</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.900" end="00:12:17.880" style="s2">it&#39;s the silo thinking that that</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.820" end="00:12:21.000" style="s2">sometimes create the wrong emphasis in a</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.880" end="00:12:24.110" style="s2">project and then that normally bites us</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.000" end="00:12:29.190" style="s2">in the back later in the in the process</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.110" end="00:12:31.920" style="s2">so navigating this complexity is tricky</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.190" end="00:12:33.810" style="s2">there&#39;s unfortunately I wasn&#39;t aware</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.920" end="00:12:35.730" style="s2">that the screen was gonna be this small</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.810" end="00:12:37.950" style="s2">so I&#39;m fully aware that most people in</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.730" end="00:12:40.620" style="s2">the back roles will not be able to read</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.950" end="00:12:42.780" style="s2">all of what&#39;s on these slides I will</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.620" end="00:12:45.570" style="s2">give the slides to Ruth and Ruth will</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.780" end="00:12:48.000" style="s2">send them out to you and there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.570" end="00:12:50.190" style="s2">hyperlinks in in the give it as a PDF</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.000" end="00:12:53.010" style="s2">and so all the resources you can</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.190" end="00:12:55.230" style="s2">directly follow up on so don&#39;t worry</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.010" end="00:13:00.500" style="s2">about that bit but what what I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.230" end="00:13:02.490" style="s2">to say with this slide is that I wrote I</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.500" end="00:13:05.010" style="s2">wrote this book called designing</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.490" end="00:13:08.490" style="s2">regenerative cultures and in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.010" end="00:13:11.220" style="s2">there&#39;s a paradox in this title because</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.490" end="00:13:13.980" style="s2">cultures aren&#39;t designed cultures emerge</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.220" end="00:13:14.610" style="s2">through our relationships and our</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.980" end="00:13:17.820" style="s2">interact</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.610" end="00:13:21.209" style="s2">with each other but in these complex</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.820" end="00:13:22.680" style="s2">systems once you accept that they are</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.209" end="00:13:25.649" style="s2">fundamentally unpredictable and</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.680" end="00:13:28.110" style="s2">uncontrollable and so the aim is not how</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.649" end="00:13:30.300" style="s2">do we manipulate it and enforce a</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.110" end="00:13:34.529" style="s2">particular future then you can start</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.300" end="00:13:37.200" style="s2">look at what is it that I can do to make</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.529" end="00:13:41.310" style="s2">it more likely that the emergent</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.200" end="00:13:43.019" style="s2">property the new part of this complex</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.310" end="00:13:45.450" style="s2">system that we can&#39;t predict that</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.019" end="00:13:49.260" style="s2">suddenly pops up will be positive rather</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.450" end="00:13:51.660" style="s2">than negative and when you look deeply</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.260" end="00:13:54.390" style="s2">into this you find that it is about</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.660" end="00:13:57.060" style="s2">building qualitative relationships</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.390" end="00:14:00.750" style="s2">paying attention to what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.060" end="00:14:03.990" style="s2">information flows who talks to whom how</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.750" end="00:14:07.980" style="s2">deep those relationships are and as you</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.990" end="00:14:09.510" style="s2">nourish these somewhat intangible parts</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.980" end="00:14:11.640" style="s2">of the system and you so that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.510" end="00:14:13.380" style="s2">education is so important because the</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.640" end="00:14:15.269" style="s2">information that flows makes a big</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.380" end="00:14:19.500" style="s2">difference in the system that will</p>

<p begin="00:16:43.529" end="00:16:47.879" style="s2">better world we can work on any of these</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.779" end="00:16:51.269" style="s2">scales and we should always be mindful</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.879" end="00:16:56.129" style="s2">of how our actions at any of those</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.269" end="00:17:00.209" style="s2">scales impact the other scales again</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.129" end="00:17:02.249" style="s2">this is a set of like that that the</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.209" end="00:17:03.689" style="s2">subtitle of my book and the working</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.249" end="00:17:05.429" style="s2">title while I was writing it was</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.689" end="00:17:09.089" style="s2">actually living the questions together</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.429" end="00:17:11.069" style="s2">and for me that&#39;s why on these cards</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.089" end="00:17:14.999" style="s2">that you played with earlier there are</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.069" end="00:17:17.249" style="s2">lots of questions questions are enabling</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.999" end="00:17:20.069" style="s2">they give people like you you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.249" end="00:17:22.259" style="s2">actually asking people to engage and to</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.069" end="00:17:25.230" style="s2">come together around a certain issue if</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.259" end="00:17:27.179" style="s2">you just talk at them they&#39;ll listen or</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.230" end="00:17:30.389" style="s2">they don&#39;t listen but there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.179" end="00:17:33.629" style="s2">something really powerful in questions</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.389" end="00:17:35.100" style="s2">and to my mind one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.629" end="00:17:37.270" style="s2">we&#39;ve got wrong is that we always want</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.100" end="00:17:41.590" style="s2">to jump towards solution</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.270" end="00:17:43.540" style="s2">and answers may be a wise culture in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.590" end="00:17:46.059" style="s2">future would give a catalogue of</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.540" end="00:17:47.860" style="s2">questions to the next generation rather</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.059" end="00:17:50.410" style="s2">than the answers because if you think of</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.860" end="00:17:52.960" style="s2">it most of today&#39;s problems were</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.410" end="00:17:55.570" style="s2">yesterday&#39;s solutions so how could we</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.960" end="00:17:57.520" style="s2">assume that our all our most</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.570" end="00:17:59.830" style="s2">well-meaning solutions that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.520" end="00:18:02.880" style="s2">working on today are not going to turn</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.830" end="00:18:05.890" style="s2">into problems for the next generation so</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.880" end="00:18:08.020" style="s2">and again an invitation to be mindful of</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.890" end="00:18:10.179" style="s2">the power of questions and these</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.020" end="00:18:14.980" style="s2">questions won&#39;t run through all of them</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.179" end="00:18:17.230" style="s2">a distillation of having looked at what</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.980" end="00:18:21.040" style="s2">normally goes wrong when we work with</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.230" end="00:18:24.670" style="s2">complex systems we do things like we set</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.040" end="00:18:27.690" style="s2">the wrong goals or we try to just look</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.670" end="00:18:29.830" style="s2">at one isolated parameter rather than</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.690" end="00:18:31.990" style="s2">optimizing the system of the whole so</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.830" end="00:18:33.850" style="s2">the most classic example is that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.990" end="00:18:36.640" style="s2">built a global economy and national</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.850" end="00:18:40.000" style="s2">economies that measure everything in GDP</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.640" end="00:18:41.710" style="s2">and GDP is actually not an emetic</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.000" end="00:18:43.990" style="s2">it&#39;s an inadequate measure of progress</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.710" end="00:18:48.280" style="s2">and when you fight a war when you have a</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.990" end="00:18:50.650" style="s2">national catastrophe GDP goes up and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.280" end="00:18:53.620" style="s2">we need better indicators of progress</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.650" end="00:18:58.330" style="s2">and we need to make sure that when we</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.620" end="00:19:00.190" style="s2">work with systems that our like we try</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.330" end="00:19:03.450" style="s2">to optimize the system as a whole rather</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.190" end="00:19:06.010" style="s2">than just work with isolated parts and</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.450" end="00:19:07.540" style="s2">in the interest of time I&#39;m not going to</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.010" end="00:19:09.670" style="s2">go through all of them but again I would</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.540" end="00:19:14.080" style="s2">really encourage you to look at the PDF</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.670" end="00:19:18.490" style="s2">when you when you get it another aspect</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.080" end="00:19:20.650" style="s2">that is about that the key things that</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.490" end="00:19:24.040" style="s2">that motivate us to actually become</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.650" end="00:19:25.179" style="s2">active to step into this small actions</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.040" end="00:19:27.910" style="s2">can make a big difference</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.179" end="00:19:31.390" style="s2">attitude is to understand that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.910" end="00:19:35.380" style="s2">been told an erroneous story about what</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.390" end="00:19:37.450" style="s2">life is all about somehow it has crept</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.380" end="00:19:39.970" style="s2">in that life is all about scarce</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.450" end="00:19:42.940" style="s2">resources and survival of the fittest</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.970" end="00:19:45.550" style="s2">and competition and some winners and</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.940" end="00:19:48.010" style="s2">some losers this is how we set up our</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.550" end="00:19:49.919" style="s2">storytelling and our storytelling is</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.010" end="00:19:53.130" style="s2">powerful it creates the world</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.919" end="00:19:56.370" style="s2">we we think we live in and we actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.130" end="00:19:58.230" style="s2">bring forth a world and conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.370" end="00:20:01.169" style="s2">I am originally trained as a biologist</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.230" end="00:20:03.840" style="s2">and I can tell you that the way</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.169" end="00:20:08.390" style="s2">evolution works since the beginning is</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.840" end="00:20:11.070" style="s2">it is a process of diversification and</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.390" end="00:20:13.470" style="s2">subsequent reintegration of that</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.070" end="00:20:17.070" style="s2">diversity at higher levels of complexity</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.470" end="00:20:19.529" style="s2">and this reintegration happens more</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.070" end="00:20:22.049" style="s2">often than not through collaboration and</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.529" end="00:20:24.269" style="s2">not through competition so while there</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.049" end="00:20:25.980" style="s2">is a little bit of competition in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.269" end="00:20:29.039" style="s2">world we have we&#39;ve seen the nature</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.980" end="00:20:33.899" style="s2">programs where we see the lion kill the</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.039" end="00:20:35.460" style="s2">the new it that&#39;s that&#39;s like ripples on</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.899" end="00:20:37.620" style="s2">the surface it&#39;s like standing in front</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.460" end="00:20:39.990" style="s2">of the ocean and being distracted by the</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.620" end="00:20:42.809" style="s2">waves so much that you can&#39;t see the</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.990" end="00:20:45.149" style="s2">water underneath but really life is all</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.809" end="00:20:47.700" style="s2">about a sea of symbiosis and working</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.149" end="00:20:51.600" style="s2">together in collaboration and if we</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.700" end="00:20:53.610" style="s2">reconnect to that then we can refit in</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.600" end="00:20:56.190" style="s2">because we are part of nature it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.610" end="00:20:58.260" style="s2">another very dangerous bit of</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.190" end="00:21:02.250" style="s2">storytelling when whenever you hear your</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.260" end="00:21:04.380" style="s2">self or others use language in a way</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.250" end="00:21:06.809" style="s2">where you have kind of groups culture</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.380" end="00:21:09.419" style="s2">there and nature here remind yourself</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.809" end="00:21:11.789" style="s2">and others that culture is an</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.419" end="00:21:14.100" style="s2">epiphenomenon of nature we are first and</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.789" end="00:21:18.059" style="s2">foremost biological beings and and so a</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.100" end="00:21:20.460" style="s2">part of this movement of diversification</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.059" end="00:21:22.590" style="s2">and subsequent reintegration of</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.460" end="00:21:24.570" style="s2">diversity at higher levels of complexity</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.590" end="00:21:26.789" style="s2">and really that&#39;s what we&#39;re called for</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.570" end="00:21:29.460" style="s2">as a species right now with all the</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.789" end="00:21:33.590" style="s2">converging crises we&#39;re facing if we</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.460" end="00:21:35.940" style="s2">don&#39;t address them as one humanity and</p>

<p begin="00:24:46.850" end="00:24:54.519" style="s2">your work in your region and coming to a</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.630" end="00:24:57.409" style="s2">close just a little anecdote by my</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.519" end="00:25:00.919" style="s2">colleague and and CEO at guy education</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.409" end="00:25:03.380" style="s2">may East once shared with me her daily</p>

<p begin="00:25:03.380" end="00:25:09.529" style="s2">was an achy moment because be up to that</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.340" end="00:25:12.559" style="s2">point I kind of got tired of the word</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.529" end="00:25:15.289" style="s2">activist and because it felt too much</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.559" end="00:25:17.570" style="s2">like fighting against something there</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.289" end="00:25:19.250" style="s2">was always this I&#39;m an activist and I</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.570" end="00:25:20.840" style="s2">don&#39;t like this and the banks are the</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.250" end="00:25:25.159" style="s2">baddies or the government is the baddie</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.840" end="00:25:26.840" style="s2">in em and so she told me that when she</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.159" end="00:25:30.679" style="s2">gets up in the morning after her morning</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.840" end="00:25:33.500" style="s2">meditation she asks herself what is it</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.679" end="00:25:37.549" style="s2">that I want to activate with the power</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.500" end="00:25:41.870" style="s2">of my attention today what what story</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.549" end="00:25:44.320" style="s2">do I want to continue and we all can</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.870" end="00:25:47.360" style="s2">make a big big difference every day</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.320" end="00:25:48.950" style="s2">simply by asking ourselves that question</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.360" end="00:25:52.340" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a redefinition of what</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.950" end="00:25:55.100" style="s2">activism is about where do we put the</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.340" end="00:25:57.710" style="s2">power of our personal attention what</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.100" end="00:26:00.950" style="s2">kind of conversations do we have are we</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.710" end="00:26:04.519" style="s2">building tomorrow&#39;s land in a way that</p>

<p begin="00:26:07.639" end="00:26:14.389" style="s2">I would encourage you to just keep that</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.760" end="00:26:17.720" style="s2">in mind and be mindful of how our</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.389" end="00:26:18.510" style="s2">stories that the stories we continued</p>

<p begin="00:26:30.990" end="00:26:34.890" style="s2">got we&#39;re on the bifurcation point in</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.210" end="00:26:37.710" style="s2">this complex system that we&#39;re part of</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.890" end="00:26:40.020" style="s2">we have the opportunity of building a</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.710" end="00:26:44.809" style="s2">more abundant world the world that works</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.020" end="00:26:48.380" style="s2">for all at the global scale starting</p>

<p begin="00:26:54.150" end="00:26:59.960" style="s2">it up that&#39;s the wrong question the</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.090" end="00:27:03.600" style="s2">right question is how do we scale it out</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.960" end="00:27:06.929" style="s2">because bigger isn&#39;t better bigger very</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.600" end="00:27:09.690" style="s2">often destroys projects but scaling out</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.929" end="00:27:10.530" style="s2">saying ooh Bali that interesting things</p>
