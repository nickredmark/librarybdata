<p begin="00:00:09.040" end="00:00:10.560" style="s2">I want to tell you first</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.900" end="00:00:13.580" style="s2"> The correct expression about the origin of this theory (I think)</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.480" end="00:00:17.520" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:00:23.880" end="00:00:25.480" style="s2"> Back in the early 1980s,</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.880" end="00:00:28.160" style="s2"> I was about the same age as you now</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.180" end="00:00:30.020" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:00:30.720" end="00:00:32.320" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:00:35.320" end="00:00:40.120" style="s2"> There was a trend of thought that existed, especially around 1984</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.780" end="00:00:43.020" style="s2"> Every generation has its own worries about reality or imagined reality</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.720" end="00:00:46.480" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:00:47.060" end="00:00:48.260" style="s2"> Our generation</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.140" end="00:00:52.940" style="s2"> The main concern is nuclear war</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.860" end="00:00:57.100" style="s2"> (You know) it started at a certain point and lasted for many years</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.380" end="00:01:01.940" style="s2"> Real worries</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.380" end="00:01:04.140" style="s2"> I used to go to Arizona</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.700" end="00:01:08.180" style="s2"> Visit the intercontinental ballistic missile, a decommissioned</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.460" end="00:01:10.180" style="s2"> Intercontinental nuclear missile</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.420" end="00:01:15.380" style="s2"> And the missile silo, which is very large, and the rocket is from</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.760" end="00:01:16.480" style="s2"> Launched here</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.880" end="00:01:19.460" style="s2"> They can fly half a circle around the earth</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.880" end="00:01:23.920" style="s2"> It’s very deep underground, in a very thick iron gate</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.940" end="00:01:27.780" style="s2"> Is a soft pale green</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.780" end="00:01:30.540" style="s2"> Like the color that people liked in the 50s</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.900" end="00:01:34.300" style="s2"> It&#39;s like a light green Star Trek console</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.300" end="00:01:35.760" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:01:36.140" end="00:01:36.880" style="s2"> what</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.440" end="00:01:38.400" style="s2"> So we get down to</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.400" end="00:01:42.140" style="s2"> Fangting, located in the desert, outside the Fangting</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.780" end="00:01:43.740" style="s2"> how to say</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.940" end="00:01:48.380" style="s2"> There is a magical object</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.940" end="00:01:50.540" style="s2"> I don&#39;t have a better word to describe</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.900" end="00:01:53.580" style="s2"> Is the front cone of the missile,</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.460" end="00:01:56.260" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:01:57.360" end="00:01:58.800" style="s2"> Very big</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.120" end="00:02:02.780" style="s2"> Very high, the top is like the top of a bullet</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.100" end="00:02:05.900" style="s2"> About three-quarters of an inch thick,</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.080" end="00:02:07.600" style="s2"> A bit like resin plastic.</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.780" end="00:02:10.340" style="s2"> This design is to protect the missile from melting when returning.</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.340" end="00:02:12.080" style="s2"> It stands there</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.320" end="00:02:13.520" style="s2"> It is inevitable that it is thought-provoking,</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.320" end="00:02:17.040" style="s2"> See here for the time being</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.560" end="00:02:19.240" style="s2"> Then we went again</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.500" end="00:02:20.860" style="s2"> Missile silos,</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.200" end="00:02:22.760" style="s2"> Interestingly</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.760" end="00:02:26.320" style="s2"> Since the Reagan era was retired, the front of the missile well</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.840" end="00:02:30.200" style="s2"> Became a museum,</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.680" end="00:02:31.380" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:02:32.160" end="00:02:35.480" style="s2"> The collection includes handicrafts from the 1980s,</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.240" end="00:02:39.720" style="s2"> Reagan and Barbachev met several times during this period.</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.080" end="00:02:42.120" style="s2"> The staff working in the museum are from the southern United States,</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.320" end="00:02:43.560" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:02:43.560" end="00:02:48.040" style="s2"> They are probably the age of (your) grandparents</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.040" end="00:02:50.120" style="s2"> Very friendly</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.200" end="00:02:53.440" style="s2"> And they love it here,</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.440" end="00:02:55.400" style="s2"> (This feeling) is like visiting grandmother’s nuclear silo</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.540" end="00:03:01.540" style="s2"> So there is a sense of conflict, you know this place</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.000" end="00:03:09.520" style="s2"> It used to be unknown, but now it is connected with hospitality</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.040" end="00:03:11.960" style="s2"> Very surreal in this dimension</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.540" end="00:03:14.140" style="s2"> Anyway, we entered</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.580" end="00:03:16.740" style="s2"> Inside the silo</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.380" end="00:03:19.980" style="s2"> They performed a mock launch for us</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.700" end="00:03:23.340" style="s2"> Let&#39;s imagine</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.080" end="00:03:31.840" style="s2"> A metal panel that is twice as long as this, and another thing like this 16 feet away</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.200" end="00:03:36.440" style="s2"> Use upgraded 50s technology</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.000" end="00:03:42.440" style="s2"> Imagine what you have to do to launch it</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.440" end="00:03:47.920" style="s2"> There are two people each with a key hanging around their necks</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.920" end="00:03:50.780" style="s2"> Although I don’t think the key will be kept on their neck forever</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.860" end="00:03:54.780" style="s2"> In order to start the launch, for safety reasons,</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.440" end="00:03:58.040" style="s2"> These two must be the two keys at the same time,</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.260" end="00:04:00.540" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:04:00.580" end="00:04:04.260" style="s2"> Put it in the lock and keep it for 10 seconds,</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.260" end="00:04:10.420" style="s2"> Only missiles can be launched. Of course, missiles are not as big as rockets launched to the moon.</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.700" end="00:04:11.360" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:04:11.360" end="00:04:15.680" style="s2"> But it’s still quite big. You know that the light silo can easily make this classroom wider.</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.180" end="00:04:18.420" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:04:18.420" end="00:04:23.200" style="s2"> And many times higher than the classroom.</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.840" end="00:04:27.200" style="s2"> The surreal simulation launch they showed us,</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.380" end="00:04:33.540" style="s2"> Because someone asked, they also told us one thing,</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.880" end="00:04:36.760" style="s2"> There used to be only one key,</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.420" end="00:04:39.740" style="s2"> But don&#39;t tell us when</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.740" end="00:04:43.580" style="s2"> Maybe during the Cuban Missile Crisis</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.620" end="00:04:47.020" style="s2"> Because we&#39;re almost</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.660" end="00:04:52.380" style="s2"> Maybe more than a little worse</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.480" end="00:04:54.960" style="s2"> It seems that in 1984,</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.460" end="00:04:59.740" style="s2"> There has been another crisis peak</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.100" end="00:05:03.020" style="s2"> This year there is a famous movie called</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.020" end="00:05:03.740" style="s2"> After the catastrophe</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.020" end="00:05:05.640" style="s2"> This movie won at the time</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.660" end="00:05:10.580" style="s2"> More reviews than any other movie,</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.680" end="00:05:12.560" style="s2"> There was also a saying</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.560" end="00:05:16.860" style="s2"> After the aftermath of the nuclear war, the survivors</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.280" end="00:05:18.720" style="s2"> All very realistic</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.720" end="00:05:22.640" style="s2"> And are all too scared,</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.380" end="00:05:25.580" style="s2"> I later found out</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.200" end="00:05:30.280" style="s2"> This film is a reason for Reagan’s pressure to restart negotiations with the Soviet Union</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.280" end="00:05:34.220" style="s2"> It depends on what you think</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.300" end="00:05:35.340" style="s2"> this movie</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.180" end="00:05:36.680" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:05:37.800" end="00:05:39.800" style="s2"> Then everyone sees it, 5 years later</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.100" end="00:05:44.460" style="s2"> No one foresaw the collapse of the Soviet Union</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.940" end="00:05:50.340" style="s2"> And in fact, 1989 did not disintegrate in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.800" end="00:05:53.920" style="s2"> Such a huge machine</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.440" end="00:05:58.980" style="s2"> Will not disintegrate all at once, but slowly dissolve over time,</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.980" end="00:06:01.040" style="s2"> Sometimes it is faltering and unable to support</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.540" end="00:06:06.820" style="s2"> It’s like losing faith in their creed</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.940" end="00:06:09.540" style="s2"> On the bright side,</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.780" end="00:06:13.660" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:06:16.240" end="00:06:17.600" style="s2"> Russia’s Soviet system,</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.160" end="00:06:20.840" style="s2"> Is a collection of multiple provinces,</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.920" end="00:06:21.560" style="s2"> Like an empire,</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.420" end="00:06:26.380" style="s2"> China and North Korea&#39;s current system</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.480" end="00:06:28.960" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:06:29.680" end="00:06:31.720" style="s2"> It still exists after the Cold War.</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.680" end="00:06:36.560" style="s2"> There are also such systems in Southeast Asia and Africa.</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.080" end="00:06:38.600" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:06:39.020" end="00:06:41.020" style="s2"> Are based on Marxist hypotheses,</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.600" end="00:06:46.640" style="s2"> The hypothesis holds that utopia exists</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.840" end="00:06:47.500" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:06:49.020" end="00:06:52.060" style="s2"> And suppose that in the future utopia,</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.580" end="00:06:55.540" style="s2"> Property is shared, everyone</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.800" end="00:06:56.300" style="s2"> Have enough</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.560" end="00:06:59.840" style="s2"> Everyone can do what they are good at as needed,</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.160" end="00:07:01.920" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:07:01.920" end="00:07:04.480" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:07:04.480" end="00:07:07.160" style="s2"> This is a wonderful view, you can imagine</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.720" end="00:07:09.480" style="s2"> It will be very attractive</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.480" end="00:07:11.840" style="s2"> Even if rationally,</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.980" end="00:07:15.060" style="s2"> Because all other systems have</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.480" end="00:07:18.160" style="s2"> Huge income gap</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.620" end="00:07:21.500" style="s2"> Just like the laws of nature govern</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.160" end="00:07:25.760" style="s2"> You can even model this with Pareto distribution</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.760" end="00:07:32.280" style="s2"> Pareto distribution is like this,</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.320" end="00:07:38.020" style="s2"> It is different from the normal distribution, as you have known before.</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.420" end="00:07:39.400" style="s2"> Despite many things</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.600" end="00:07:44.640" style="s2"> Are in line with the normal distribution, but the normal distribution still has its</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.020" end="00:07:45.980" style="s2"> Not applicable</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.720" end="00:07:49.920" style="s2"> If you have played Monopoly, you understand</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.920" end="00:07:52.340" style="s2"> What is the Pareto distribution,</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.100" end="00:07:54.460" style="s2"> Assuming everyone has at the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.460" end="00:07:56.900" style="s2"> The same amount of money,</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.940" end="00:08:00.380" style="s2"> Can be understood as property, the same amount of property,</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.380" end="00:08:04.000" style="s2"> Then as the game progresses, like a chance function</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.000" end="00:08:07.520" style="s2"> I mean, I know you are using strategy in this game,</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.520" end="00:08:10.880" style="s2"> But the basic rule is to buy everything you can get</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.900" end="00:08:14.780" style="s2"> Then stingy deals</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.980" end="00:08:18.260" style="s2"> At the beginning everyone has the same amount of property</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.520" end="00:08:20.600" style="s2"> Then you start the game</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.600" end="00:08:24.880" style="s2"> If there are a sufficient number of players theoretically a normal distribution</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.880" end="00:08:26.620" style="s2"> Because some people will keep winning relatively,</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.620" end="00:08:30.860" style="s2"> While others will keep losing</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.860" end="00:08:33.500" style="s2"> Money began to show a normal distribution</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.540" end="00:08:35.540" style="s2"> but</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.880" end="00:08:40.120" style="s2"> About money and many other things</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.800" end="00:08:43.400" style="s2"> 0 will get involved</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.240" end="00:08:46.640" style="s2"> 0 is a strange number,</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.780" end="00:08:50.540" style="s2"> If you play a trading game and the asset is 0</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.940" end="00:08:52.060" style="s2"> You are out.</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.680" end="00:08:56.600" style="s2"> So it is very difficult to recover from 0,</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.600" end="00:08:59.780" style="s2"> Just like if you are cursed in the Monopoly game,</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.780" end="00:09:03.480" style="s2"> You have some resources when you start</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.480" end="00:09:07.220" style="s2"> But when you enter certain hotels, there is a crisis,</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.220" end="00:09:09.960" style="s2"> You will be swept out</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.960" end="00:09:14.020" style="s2"> At this time, your assets are 0, even if you have something</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.260" end="00:09:14.980" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:09:14.980" end="00:09:17.220" style="s2"> If you are lucky, maybe you will be saved</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.480" end="00:09:19.980" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:09:22.440" end="00:09:24.520" style="s2"> But you know when bad luck comes</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.840" end="00:09:29.120" style="s2"> So what happens when you keep playing Monopoly</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.860" end="00:09:32.260" style="s2"> More and more people have property 0</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.360" end="00:09:35.760" style="s2"> Fewer and fewer people have more and more</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.760" end="00:09:37.280" style="s2"> assets</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.620" end="00:09:39.220" style="s2"> When the game is over,</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.560" end="00:09:43.080" style="s2"> Everyone has become a pauper, only one person has all the assets</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.140" end="00:09:44.980" style="s2"> The interesting phenomenon revealed in this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.980" end="00:09:48.320" style="s2"> In a sense, this is how the trading game works</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.360" end="00:09:53.080" style="s2"> You may want to know why the rich and poor are uneven in society</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.080" end="00:09:56.420" style="s2"> It is easy to think of social corruption,</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.980" end="00:09:57.860" style="s2"> Maybe</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.640" end="00:10:02.080" style="s2"> Society is a bit or very corrupt,</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.860" end="00:10:05.100" style="s2"> This has changed,</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.100" end="00:10:07.180" style="s2"> There is no society without crime,</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.760" end="00:10:10.000" style="s2"> This is inherent composition</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.680" end="00:10:11.600" style="s2"> In short,</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.040" end="00:10:18.800" style="s2"> Trading games have a tendency to produce Pareto distribution, that is, most people have very little wealth.</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.420" end="00:10:22.380" style="s2"> Very few people have a lot of wealth</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.580" end="00:10:25.300" style="s2"> This ratio is about 1%, yes</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.400" end="00:10:28.560" style="s2"> The number 1% is observed in every society</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.560" end="00:10:31.180" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:10:31.180" end="00:10:34.620" style="s2"> It has nothing to do with what kind of government or system,</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.620" end="00:10:37.820" style="s2"> This situation must have happened in the Soviet regime,</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.820" end="00:10:42.120" style="s2"> Many people die because of extreme poverty</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.460" end="00:10:42.960" style="s2"> and so</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.940" end="00:10:44.900" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:10:45.720" end="00:10:48.680" style="s2"> Utopian dream</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.180" end="00:10:51.620" style="s2"> It’s impossible for many very complicated reasons</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.720" end="00:10:54.520" style="s2"> One of them is that when people are trading, it is difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.520" end="00:10:58.500" style="s2"> (Inherent) statistical distribution</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.500" end="00:11:00.280" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:11:00.280" end="00:11:04.280" style="s2"> Because it’s just a statistical law, and I should tell you</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.280" end="00:11:09.480" style="s2"> Pareto distribution also dominates many situations,</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.980" end="00:11:13.100" style="s2"> So, taking the book market as an example, if I remember correctly,</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.100" end="00:11:18.640" style="s2"> About a million English books were published last year,</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.980" end="00:11:22.740" style="s2"> About 500 of them sold more than 100,000 copies,</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.740" end="00:11:26.640" style="s2"> There are many other sets of books sold 0 copies,</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.640" end="00:11:28.800" style="s2"> Among these 500 books, one of them is authored by Stephen King,</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.080" end="00:11:30.760" style="s2"> He can take about half of the sales,</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.020" end="00:11:35.180" style="s2"> Because there are about 5 writers in English books</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.460" end="00:11:37.740" style="s2"> In each airport’s paper media shelves,</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.000" end="00:11:40.920" style="s2"> All occupy the most conspicuous position,</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.920" end="00:11:45.380" style="s2"> (This position) is very valuable, yes, this kind of information is repeated everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.580" end="00:11:47.540" style="s2"> And the location is outstanding,</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.820" end="00:11:50.540" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:11:50.540" end="00:11:53.460" style="s2"> If people are in a hurry and just want to find something to read, they won’t care about the name</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.460" end="00:11:56.920" style="s2"> Just grab a copy directly from a conspicuous position, so most of the money goes into these people’s pockets, you know,</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.240" end="00:11:59.240" style="s2"> Success breeds success,</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.240" end="00:12:02.700" style="s2"> Failure breeds failure, this curve need not be linear,</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.700" end="00:12:05.780" style="s2"> This is a difficult situation</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.860" end="00:12:08.340" style="s2"> Especially in society,</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.600" end="00:12:11.000" style="s2"> What we know is</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.880" end="00:12:15.400" style="s2"> Extend this unfairness</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.060" end="00:12:20.500" style="s2"> People at the bottom of the Pareto distribution</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.500" end="00:12:22.660" style="s2"> Will become more and more aggressive,</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.660" end="00:12:26.440" style="s2"> It’s like, you can think that men have a threshold for violent behavior</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.000" end="00:12:29.320" style="s2"> This situation is important for men</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.320" end="00:12:31.560" style="s2"> But not important for women</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.000" end="00:12:33.120" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:12:33.120" end="00:12:35.940" style="s2"> This is actually a different state for men and women</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.940" end="00:12:38.340" style="s2"> Because men as women’s partners are market-oriented to a certain extent,</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.340" end="00:12:42.700" style="s2"> So this is important for men</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.900" end="00:12:44.180" style="s2"> Men compete with each other in an unequal society</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.000" end="00:12:48.600" style="s2"> Corresponding social status</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.020" end="00:12:50.940" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:12:51.300" end="00:12:52.820" style="s2"> If you are in a lower position in society</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.020" end="00:12:54.140" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:12:54.140" end="00:12:57.760" style="s2"> Basically no chance to rise</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.060" end="00:13:00.140" style="s2"> Because society is not structured</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.640" end="00:13:02.720" style="s2"> So men are motivated</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.260" end="00:13:05.020" style="s2"> Become more aggressive</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.260" end="00:13:09.260" style="s2"> And showing criminal tendencies</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.380" end="00:13:10.980" style="s2"> You can think of a crime threshold</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.320" end="00:13:12.280" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:13:12.400" end="00:13:15.280" style="s2"> In specific areas such as geography or politics,</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.940" end="00:13:19.300" style="s2"> More unfair pressure</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.300" end="00:13:21.720" style="s2"> More pressure</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.860" end="00:13:25.580" style="s2"> The more men commit crimes above the threshold</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.580" end="00:13:29.540" style="s2"> There is a lot of research in drug gangs</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.140" end="00:13:31.260" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:13:31.260" end="00:13:36.520" style="s2"> Especially in the Chicago study, a sociologist even went directly into the drug gang</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.740" end="00:13:39.780" style="s2"> Maybe the leader of a drug gang,</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.560" end="00:13:41.300" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:13:42.020" end="00:13:46.660" style="s2"> It cannot be said that narcissism is inevitable, but it may be a reasonable way to explain the problem</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.660" end="00:13:48.020" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:13:48.180" end="00:13:49.300" style="s2"> Maybe he</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.660" end="00:13:53.260" style="s2"> Feel complacent about the idea of ​​being the subject of a book</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.900" end="00:13:57.820" style="s2"> So this sociologist can</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.820" end="00:14:01.080" style="s2"> Get in touch with the drug gang and have a considerable degree of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.260" end="00:14:03.980" style="s2"> Then the housing plan in the drug gang area</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.160" end="00:14:05.400" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:14:05.400" end="00:14:08.080" style="s2"> Caused their residence to be demolished and the gang fell apart</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.580" end="00:14:10.220" style="s2"> Sociologists got those books</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.500" end="00:14:12.100" style="s2"> Because they keep</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.100" end="00:14:16.580" style="s2"> He found ordinary street drug dealers,</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.660" end="00:14:18.540" style="s2"> They have to find a job first</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.400" end="00:14:22.320" style="s2"> Income is well below average</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.000" end="00:14:26.340" style="s2"> At the top of the gang</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.400" end="00:14:32.420" style="s2"> According to the Pareto distribution, a small percentage of people at the top earn a lot of income</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.820" end="00:14:35.360" style="s2"> Bottom</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.360" end="00:14:39.000" style="s2"> Wait for the opportunity to see if they have the opportunity to upgrade</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.000" end="00:14:42.180" style="s2"> This is quite a violent game</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.220" end="00:14:44.860" style="s2"> Maybe some people are out at the top</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.400" end="00:14:47.240" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:14:47.740" end="00:14:51.980" style="s2"> It will open up some opportunities to people at the lower levels</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.980" end="00:14:56.580" style="s2"> Maybe someone can level up</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.880" end="00:15:06.080" style="s2"> So Pareto distribution is reflected in different fields</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.540" end="00:15:09.860" style="s2"> Such as on the bestseller list</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.880" end="00:15:11.080" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:15:11.100" end="00:15:13.580" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:15:14.600" end="00:15:19.760" style="s2"> This distribution also applies to all areas of human production</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.760" end="00:15:25.040" style="s2"> Whether in creative fields such as art or industrial products</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.040" end="00:15:26.180" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:15:28.580" end="00:15:30.420" style="s2"> Almost all failures</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.820" end="00:15:33.820" style="s2"> Few successes</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.820" end="00:15:36.260" style="s2"> Beyond anyone&#39;s knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.260" end="00:15:40.140" style="s2"> Take Apple as an example</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.400" end="00:15:42.560" style="s2"> They have competitors</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.560" end="00:15:46.960" style="s2"> But they have an absolute advantage, earning huge income of billions of dollars</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.020" end="00:15:50.620" style="s2"> I don’t know that Apple’s market value is trillions of dollars</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.320" end="00:15:52.600" style="s2"> Very close even if not</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.600" end="00:15:56.320" style="s2"> This is a lot of money</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.320" end="00:16:00.900" style="s2"> If I remember correctly, the 40 richest people in the world</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.900" end="00:16:04.600" style="s2"> Has as many assets as the bottom 2 billion people</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.440" end="00:16:09.300" style="s2"> It’s not that they stuffed the mattress with money</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.740" end="00:16:13.460" style="s2"> Or they have skyscrapers full of money</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.940" end="00:16:17.380" style="s2"> The money has lost its economic value</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.500" end="00:16:21.700" style="s2"> You can&#39;t spend 28 billion dollars</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.700" end="00:16:26.180" style="s2"> So sometimes you can do something good with him, such as Bill Gates</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.500" end="00:16:29.200" style="s2"> Use the money reasonably</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.200" end="00:16:33.220" style="s2"> The reason for talking about the above is that you should know</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.920" end="00:16:34.580" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:16:35.460" end="00:16:37.700" style="s2"> Unfairness</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.600" end="00:16:42.120" style="s2"> Permeate all aspects of human life</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.140" end="00:16:43.340" style="s2"> It&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.660" end="00:16:46.900" style="s2"> Scoring in a hockey game, my son told me</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.900" end="00:16:50.180" style="s2"> He has stable scoring statistics on the hockey team</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.700" end="00:16:57.020" style="s2"> If you don’t count Wayne’s score,</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.020" end="00:17:02.460" style="s2"> He still gets enough points as an assist, more than any other hockey player</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.920" end="00:17:03.420" style="s2"> and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.160" end="00:17:06.680" style="s2"> Even at the top of the Pareto distribution</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.820" end="00:17:08.340" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:17:08.340" end="00:17:12.380" style="s2"> Some people do what they are good at</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.380" end="00:17:17.060" style="s2"> There are other people who do better than these people, even unmatched</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.420" end="00:17:17.920" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:17:18.840" end="00:17:24.840" style="s2"> A lot of profits will flow to these places, and you know why this is so</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.000" end="00:17:28.280" style="s2"> Like you start writing a book</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.000" end="00:17:29.740" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:17:29.740" end="00:17:35.180" style="s2"> In rare cases, some people read your book and they like it</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.180" end="00:17:37.540" style="s2"> You have a higher probability of writing a book</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.540" end="00:17:43.360" style="s2"> If the reader still likes it, then you will publish a third book, and then the reader will start to understand who you are,</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.360" end="00:17:47.900" style="s2"> Because they know you, they will give you some opportunities and your social network will grow</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.100" end="00:17:50.260" style="s2"> Your wealth and creativity</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.680" end="00:17:54.760" style="s2"> Will grow exponentially</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.580" end="00:17:58.220" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:17:59.200" end="00:18:01.120" style="s2"> On the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.660" end="00:18:06.140" style="s2"> If you start to fail, why some people fail,</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.940" end="00:18:14.940" style="s2"> A popular idea in our culture is that lack of money leads to poverty. This is a stupid idea.</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.580" end="00:18:20.220" style="s2"> Because money is difficult to control, I have a client who is a drug addict</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.220" end="00:18:25.260" style="s2"> The worst for them is that they have some money</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.720" end="00:18:30.040" style="s2"> They are over, first of all, they are gathered around</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.720" end="00:18:33.200" style="s2"> Some people with antisocial personality tendencies</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.400" end="00:18:37.900" style="s2"> Especially people who are not optimistic enough to protect themselves well</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.900" end="00:18:42.860" style="s2"> Once they have money, they will go to the bar and spend money with friends.</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.860" end="00:18:46.980" style="s2"> I was particularly impressed with one person, whenever he has money,</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.140" end="00:18:49.820" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:18:49.860" end="00:18:55.860" style="s2"> He will be missing for 5 days, you may find him in the ditch, he will go to the bar,</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.620" end="00:19:00.700" style="s2"> Spend every penny on drugs and alcohol</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.140" end="00:19:04.380" style="s2"> Wake up in the ditch, dying</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.780" end="00:19:08.020" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:19:08.620" end="00:19:13.500" style="s2"> Then he will be ashamed, horrified, and regret</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.500" end="00:19:19.460" style="s2"> Then he will regroup until the next check appears</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.460" end="00:19:23.780" style="s2"> Then the same thing happened again</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.880" end="00:19:28.200" style="s2"> It seems that money is not good for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.200" end="00:19:34.060" style="s2"> It’s difficult to manage money well, and money is easy to lose. I mean, the elderly have a lot of time</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.240" end="00:19:38.640" style="s2"> Scammers covet them online all the time</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.240" end="00:19:41.080" style="s2"> Just giving money is like pouring water on their hands</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.080" end="00:19:44.540" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:19:44.540" end="00:19:48.460" style="s2"> This will not have a great effect</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.460" end="00:19:52.700" style="s2"> Of course, giving money to the poor with low IQ is not very useful</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.720" end="00:19:55.640" style="s2"> People don’t like the concept of IQ</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.460" end="00:20:01.220" style="s2"> Because it seems very arbitrary,</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.220" end="00:20:03.700" style="s2"> Feel unworthy of having a high IQ</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.700" end="00:20:10.000" style="s2"> Actually IQ was set at the beginning and it is very stable</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.160" end="00:20:12.720" style="s2"> You can keep people with high IQs from being educated, make them stupid, and cannot release their own possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.720" end="00:20:16.480" style="s2"> but</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.480" end="00:20:21.520" style="s2"> If anyone can improve the IQ of people with low IQ,</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.620" end="00:20:27.060" style="s2"> You can definitely apply for the Nobel Prize, because people have tried all kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.060" end="00:20:33.380" style="s2"> The most recent ones are related to the people of lumosity games,</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.120" end="00:20:40.040" style="s2"> This game can live forever anything except from being smart</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.040" end="00:20:43.540" style="s2"> We don&#39;t know why</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.120" end="00:20:47.800" style="s2"> Intelligence is a cross-domain phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.800" end="00:20:51.920" style="s2"> You can practice in any field until you become proficient</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.920" end="00:20:58.000" style="s2"> And hope that this will make you more comfortable in other fields</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.580" end="00:21:02.100" style="s2"> Not actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.100" end="00:21:08.840" style="s2"> So far no one can do it, even if someone claims to be rentable, it turns out to be untenable in the end</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.840" end="00:21:12.040" style="s2"> People have tried for a long time and still can’t do it</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.040" end="00:21:20.040" style="s2"> Different IQs do make a difference</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.120" end="00:21:25.000" style="s2"> Your average IQ is about 125, 130</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.120" end="00:21:30.360" style="s2"> 115 has exceeded 85% of the population</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.040" end="00:21:35.800" style="s2"> But 115 is still not enough for going to a prestigious university</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.120" end="00:21:41.760" style="s2"> 130 may be able to make you learn something when you graduate</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.540" end="00:21:43.580" style="s2"> 145 is the top level</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.760" end="00:21:48.160" style="s2"> You can do whatever you want</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.160" end="00:21:52.200" style="s2"> The higher your IQ, the greater the difference in abilities in different aspects</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.200" end="00:21:56.540" style="s2"> For example, you have a very high IQ in language, but not necessarily in mathematics, or other aspects</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.540" end="00:21:59.980" style="s2"> But high IQ is still a significant factor in success</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.600" end="00:22:04.440" style="s2"> I don&#39;t know how to do this</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.020" end="00:22:07.420" style="s2"> Why people with high IQ can make more money</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.040" end="00:22:13.320" style="s2"> Because of higher production efficiency</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.320" end="00:22:19.640" style="s2"> If you sort 1000 people by IQ, people with high IQ will first come up with new ways</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.640" end="00:22:24.260" style="s2"> They will also generate more solutions and evaluate which is better</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.380" end="00:22:28.700" style="s2"> People with an IQ of 90 account for 15% of the total population</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.580" end="00:22:36.340" style="s2"> Think about it carefully, it accounts for 15% of the total population</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.300" end="00:22:41.780" style="s2"> This is just a threshold for being able to read the instructions and follow the instructions</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.720" end="00:22:47.720" style="s2"> Our society is becoming increasingly complex</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.840" end="00:22:50.520" style="s2"> It is clear</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.160" end="00:22:53.400" style="s2"> You know what liberals think</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.400" end="00:22:58.640" style="s2"> Social injustice is caused by unemployment</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.640" end="00:23:00.760" style="s2"> Conservatives believe that everyone should have a shared job</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.760" end="00:23:06.380" style="s2"> But neither side has thought that the gap between human intelligence and ability is so large</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.620" end="00:23:08.940" style="s2"> Bigger than anyone thought</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.060" end="00:23:11.860" style="s2"> This leads to a structural problem</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.060" end="00:23:13.260" style="s2"> I have a client</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.140" end="00:23:18.220" style="s2"> I found him a volunteer job, which is harder to obtain than expected</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.220" end="00:23:20.100" style="s2"> You need a certificate of no criminal record</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.100" end="00:23:22.740" style="s2"> Sometimes volunteer work is harder than real work</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.060" end="00:23:25.460" style="s2"> But we still helped him get this job</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.720" end="00:23:27.200" style="s2"> he needs</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.200" end="00:23:29.860" style="s2"> Fold up papers or documents, etc. He works in a charity</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.880" end="00:23:34.320" style="s2"> He needs to fold these documents three times so that they can fit in an envelope</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.840" end="00:23:35.340" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:23:36.480" end="00:23:41.840" style="s2"> Files are piled up into mountains, and you need to match them with the right envelope</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.840" end="00:23:45.400" style="s2"> The envelopes are piled up, some are in French and some are in English</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.400" end="00:23:47.960" style="s2"> The French envelope must match the French document</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.580" end="00:23:53.460" style="s2"> If there is an envelope out of order</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.840" end="00:23:57.520" style="s2"> He must figure out which document matches</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.520" end="00:24:00.520" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:24:01.000" end="00:24:02.480" style="s2"> then</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.480" end="00:24:05.760" style="s2"> Some documents also have photos or pictures attached</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.760" end="00:24:08.020" style="s2"> These cannot be bent</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.020" end="00:24:12.260" style="s2"> And they haven’t put them in one place, so we have to find a way to see how to fold the files</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.260" end="00:24:17.460" style="s2"> Each situation folds in a different way</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.780" end="00:24:19.700" style="s2"> Another thing is</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.500" end="00:24:25.540" style="s2"> I never realized how difficult it is to fold the documents into an envelope</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.540" end="00:24:27.980" style="s2"> Until i saw someone couldn&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.460" end="00:24:30.780" style="s2"> He may have an IQ of about 80</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.780" end="00:24:35.200" style="s2"> If you meet him on the street, you won’t notice the difference</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.420" end="00:24:36.900" style="s2"> He is just an ordinary person</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.900" end="00:24:38.500" style="s2"> Can&#39;t see what&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.220" end="00:24:44.020" style="s2"> I was trained to stack these files for about 30 hours</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.680" end="00:24:47.080" style="s2"> He did quite well</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.340" end="00:24:49.620" style="s2"> If you are good at doing this</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.960" end="00:24:51.560" style="s2"> When folded</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.360" end="00:24:55.520" style="s2"> The edges must be very precise</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.520" end="00:24:59.600" style="s2"> The error cannot exceed 1/2 mm</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.600" end="00:25:01.140" style="s2"> Then fold a second time</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.480" end="00:25:03.840" style="s2"> The error is the same as the first time</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.020" end="00:25:06.740" style="s2"> Assuming the error is 1/8 inch when first folded</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.740" end="00:25:10.060" style="s2"> The same goes for the second fold</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.060" end="00:25:14.340" style="s2"> It will be a bit deformed, which means the total error is 1/4 inch</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.400" end="00:25:16.880" style="s2"> Then I can’t put the envelope</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.880" end="00:25:21.560" style="s2"> The envelope will be crumpled and then jammed in the sorting machine</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.380" end="00:25:22.880" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:25:24.440" end="00:25:28.880" style="s2"> He tried his best to do this job well</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.000" end="00:25:31.080" style="s2"> But the agency still absolutely fired him</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.220" end="00:25:34.500" style="s2"> This means</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.540" end="00:25:36.740" style="s2"> You can&#39;t find a job</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.080" end="00:25:40.360" style="s2"> Even a voluntary charity job</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.020" end="00:25:43.580" style="s2"> Still decided to fire you</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.120" end="00:25:45.480" style="s2"> You understand what i mean</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.780" end="00:25:50.180" style="s2"> I communicated with the lady who runs this charity</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.140" end="00:25:52.180" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:25:55.340" end="00:25:59.340" style="s2"> Explain that the loss of this job may be fatal to everyone</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.780" end="00:26:00.420" style="s2"> Of course she also has her consideration</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.180" end="00:26:05.740" style="s2"> He often asks others how to do his job well</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.380" end="00:26:09.660" style="s2"> This will affect the efficiency of others</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.660" end="00:26:12.760" style="s2"> This is a real conflict, it’s not that she is mean</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.120" end="00:26:18.000" style="s2"> She wants to ensure the normal operation of the organization</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.060" end="00:26:21.940" style="s2"> This put her in a dilemma</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.180" end="00:26:27.460" style="s2"> Soon after this, he finally decided that this job was not suitable for him,</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.460" end="00:26:30.800" style="s2"> This is stressful</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.060" end="00:26:31.560" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:26:31.560" end="00:26:35.780" style="s2"> He gave up and the problem was finally solved, except that he still had no job is a problem</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.140" end="00:26:38.300" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:26:40.160" end="00:26:43.280" style="s2"> Fortunately, this story ended well</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.520" end="00:26:44.020" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:26:45.440" end="00:26:48.960" style="s2"> As far as I know, he has a dog because he is very lonely.</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.960" end="00:26:52.440" style="s2"> He trained this dog</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.440" end="00:26:54.860" style="s2"> Lost 30 pounds</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.860" end="00:26:57.020" style="s2"> Because the dog is in a dominant position at the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.020" end="00:27:03.180" style="s2"> He must fight with the dog to decide who has control. Keeping a dog has many responsibilities</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.180" end="00:27:05.540" style="s2"> He has a deep relationship with the dog</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.260" end="00:27:09.220" style="s2"> Think of ways to live with the dog</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.220" end="00:27:13.040" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:27:15.520" end="00:27:22.480" style="s2"> It sounds weird, like a nuclear bomb launching bin. At first, people gathered around him.</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.480" end="00:27:24.280" style="s2"> Because he felt he was abusing the dog</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.280" end="00:27:27.660" style="s2"> Actually what I saw was that the dog was abusing him</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.360" end="00:27:30.860" style="s2"> later</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.100" end="00:27:34.980" style="s2"> He got a job training a dog for a lady</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.700" end="00:27:36.980" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:27:37.580" end="00:27:39.180" style="s2"> Hurray!!!</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.380" end="00:27:43.020" style="s2"> It&#39;s a miracle</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.020" end="00:27:46.500" style="s2"> Anyway, I tell this story because</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.500" end="00:27:48.420" style="s2"> There was a reason for the Cold War</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.720" end="00:27:51.240" style="s2"> The reason is</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.480" end="00:27:52.840" style="s2"> unfair</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.480" end="00:27:56.120" style="s2"> There are different theories attributing unfairness</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.120" end="00:27:58.540" style="s2"> For example, why does unfairness exist?</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.280" end="00:28:01.280" style="s2"> Marx theorizes</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.280" end="00:28:05.740" style="s2"> Human property should be average,</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.740" end="00:28:09.400" style="s2"> Some people grab more property from other people</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.640" end="00:28:10.140" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:28:12.020" end="00:28:17.620" style="s2"> It’s easy to rule out this concept because the total amount of money is not fixed</p>

<p begin="00:29:26.560" end="00:29:28.880" style="s2"> People will not be taught about this issue</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.880" end="00:29:38.680" style="s2"> But in fact, there are statistics that estimate that more than 30 million people were killed in Russia between 1919 and 1959.</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.700" end="00:29:39.820" style="s2"> It&#39;s cruel</p>

<p begin="00:30:22.460" end="00:30:24.780" style="s2"> But it helps me understand things better</p>

<p begin="00:30:28.860" end="00:30:34.300" style="s2"> I realized that this happened many years ago when I was working in a high-level security prison</p>

<p begin="00:30:47.880" end="00:30:49.600" style="s2"> Actually very likely</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.760" end="00:30:52.640" style="s2"> No matter what kind of people you have read about doing unimaginable things, you think you would never do it</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.860" end="00:30:56.700" style="s2"> It&#39;s actually possible</p>

<p begin="00:30:59.300" end="00:31:03.380" style="s2"> Imagine you are in that situation</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.960" end="00:31:08.700" style="s2"> This is very helpful for you to understand this phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.180" end="00:31:11.360" style="s2"> Because for the things you don&#39;t want to know</p>

<p begin="00:31:35.020" end="00:31:38.300" style="s2"> At the same time you have to endure a lot</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.300" end="00:31:40.460" style="s2"> In a very structured society, such as Canada</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.200" end="00:31:43.640" style="s2"> People are calm</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.880" end="00:31:46.080" style="s2"> Because our heater is always heating</p>

<p begin="00:31:56.340" end="00:32:01.540" style="s2"> By imagining the completion of this project, I remind myself every day that this is a miracle</p>

<p begin="00:32:22.300" end="00:32:24.460" style="s2"> But they have never been unreliable</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.060" end="00:32:26.180" style="s2"> It&#39;s impossible</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.000" end="00:32:29.920" style="s2"> Because of the reliable public infrastructure</p>

<p begin="00:32:36.460" end="00:32:38.220" style="s2"> That means you don’t have to do it for food</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.220" end="00:32:41.700" style="s2"> Fierce competition for housing</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.860" end="00:32:45.700" style="s2"> It&#39;s easy to think that you are a good person</p>

<p begin="00:32:48.320" end="00:32:50.400" style="s2"> Because you never do bad things to other people</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.400" end="00:32:55.120" style="s2"> Ironically because you never need to do bad things, there is no reason to do bad things</p>

<p begin="00:32:57.740" end="00:33:00.300" style="s2"> These reasons have actually risen many times in the past</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.580" end="00:33:06.140" style="s2"> Actually this is an axiom, no exceptions</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.660" end="00:33:07.660" style="s2"> The reason we are exceptional is because</p>

<p begin="00:33:25.660" end="00:33:29.740" style="s2"> Back to the industrial age, after the end of the industrial revolution</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.800" end="00:33:32.680" style="s2"> The working environment of workers is quite cruel</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.680" end="00:33:39.000" style="s2"> George Orwell wrote a book called Road to Wigan Pier</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.440" end="00:33:41.680" style="s2"> Describes things in the 1930s</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.300" end="00:33:43.860" style="s2"> I guess it should be in the 30s</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.220" end="00:33:48.380" style="s2"> Working and living in the mines of this England</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.640" end="00:33:50.560" style="s2"> These poor workers</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.560" end="00:33:56.240" style="s2"> They have to climb two miles in the tunnel to get to work. They cannot stand in the tunnel</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.440" end="00:33:58.160" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:33:58.840" end="00:34:03.480" style="s2"> Then work for 8 hours to chisel coal</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.480" end="00:34:06.680" style="s2"> It&#39;s difficult, dirty and dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.680" end="00:34:11.740" style="s2"> Of course there is black lung disease, and the income is not high</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.740" end="00:34:13.440" style="s2"> After work</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.540" end="00:34:16.940" style="s2"> Climb two more miles back</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.080" end="00:34:20.920" style="s2"> No reward for climbing the tunnel back and forth, just commuting</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.360" end="00:34:23.520" style="s2"> The residence of these people</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.520" end="00:34:27.560" style="s2"> It’s not good, and the food is not good. Many people lose their teeth when they are about 30 years old.</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.560" end="00:34:28.400" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:34:28.400" end="00:34:33.220" style="s2"> Even in the UK, being poor is not a joke, of course there are many rich people here</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.260" end="00:34:35.360" style="s2"> So there are enough reasons</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.360" end="00:34:38.340" style="s2"> Think that the uneven distribution of rich and poor is a natural state</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.040" end="00:34:41.600" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:34:41.860" end="00:34:48.180" style="s2"> In the west, in 1895, per capita daily consumption was equivalent to today’s $1</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.780" end="00:34:50.460" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:34:51.040" end="00:34:53.680" style="s2"> This is not common in most places in the world today</p>

<p begin="00:34:56.260" end="00:34:58.780" style="s2"> So there are reasons to consider inequality</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.780" end="00:35:03.940" style="s2"> Russia is inspired by Marxism, we are inspired by John Mueller and John Locke</p>

<p begin="00:35:18.800" end="00:35:22.200" style="s2"> This theory now seems very applicable</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.880" end="00:35:25.760" style="s2"> But if you consider (damn) competition</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.760" end="00:35:28.980" style="s2"> The bottom of this concept will be very different</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.260" end="00:35:35.100" style="s2"> These two thoughts have confronted and conflicted, and they have not completely ended yet.</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.120" end="00:35:42.040" style="s2"> For example, China, although it is now a mixture of communism and capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.040" end="00:35:46.200" style="s2"> I hope they are more interested in becoming rich</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.700" end="00:35:48.180" style="s2"> Greed is the main driving force of war</p>

<p begin="00:36:36.140" end="00:36:39.260" style="s2"> This drama is very popular in East Germany</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.260" end="00:36:42.120" style="s2"> The air time is empty</p>

<p begin="00:37:42.660" end="00:37:45.440" style="s2"> But also better than 50 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.600" end="00:37:48.800" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:37:48.800" end="00:37:51.880" style="s2"> Many people have been lifted out of poverty in the past 15 years</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.880" end="00:37:56.280" style="s2"> There have been cases in history where people gathered economic resources</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.600" end="00:37:59.980" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:38:00.160" end="00:38:05.700" style="s2"> Want to achieve high growth that the most optimistic cannot predict</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.920" end="00:38:07.420" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:38:09.900" end="00:38:12.260" style="s2"> It’s not that we don’t have any problems</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.660" end="00:38:15.580" style="s2"> During this period</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.260" end="00:38:21.220" style="s2"> I am addicted to</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.220" end="00:38:22.720" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:38:24.380" end="00:38:26.540" style="s2"> One question, this question is</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.700" end="00:38:29.320" style="s2"> why</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.660" end="00:38:32.100" style="s2"> Humans have to develop two camps</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.360" end="00:38:36.140" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:38:37.760" end="00:38:38.440" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:38:39.300" end="00:38:42.260" style="s2"> Produce a lot of hydrogen bombs</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.260" end="00:38:46.360" style="s2"> I don’t know if you understand hydrogen bombs, they need to be ejected by atoms</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.320" end="00:38:51.000" style="s2"> The atomic bomb is already very powerful,</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.000" end="00:38:54.820" style="s2"> The hydrogen bomb is more powerful</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.860" end="00:38:58.000" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:38:58.140" end="00:39:04.040" style="s2"> At the height of the cold war</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.040" end="00:39:07.980" style="s2"> Thousands of these weapons are directed at the Soviet Union and the West</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.080" end="00:39:10.760" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:39:11.320" end="00:39:12.360" style="s2"> This is enough</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.760" end="00:39:15.240" style="s2"> Destroy everything</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.840" end="00:39:19.420" style="s2"> This is a very dangerous game</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.420" end="00:39:24.340" style="s2"> Whether for human purpose or accident</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.760" end="00:39:26.520" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:39:26.600" end="00:39:32.120" style="s2"> It’s a mistake, or yo people are a bit crazier than expected</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.460" end="00:39:36.700" style="s2"> Maybe you would say no one wants to really destroy the world</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.980" end="00:39:40.060" style="s2"> This shows that you don’t know enough about Stalin</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.880" end="00:39:41.540" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:39:41.640" end="00:39:45.560" style="s2"> All people who lived in power in the 20th century under Stalin’s statistics</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.080" end="00:39:47.080" style="s2"> Stalin is</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.320" end="00:39:51.780" style="s2"> Often bring things to destruction</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.760" end="00:39:55.820" style="s2"> There is a saying that he was murdered by Khrushchev and his staff</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.460" end="00:40:00.060" style="s2"> Khrushchev is the next generation of leaders</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.420" end="00:40:00.920" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:40:01.480" end="00:40:06.700" style="s2"> If he was not murdered, at least no medical care was provided when he was sick</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.580" end="00:40:14.060" style="s2"> There is reasonable evidence that he wanted to invade Western Europe</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.060" end="00:40:17.220" style="s2"> He doesn&#39;t care how much damage it will cause</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.300" end="00:40:21.080" style="s2"> He has persecuted millions</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.080" end="00:40:26.640" style="s2"> It won&#39;t bother him</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.580" end="00:40:31.080" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:40:32.540" end="00:40:37.440" style="s2"> This is just my guess, it&#39;s crazy when I do this</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.820" end="00:40:42.900" style="s2"> So I started thinking about the belief system</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.480" end="00:40:47.860" style="s2"> Because each camp has its own belief system, the Western system was born in Greece/Rome/Jesus/Christ and has</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.220" end="00:40:50.340" style="s2"> Very long history</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.680" end="00:40:55.540" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:40:56.620" end="00:41:00.920" style="s2"> Also produced in different philosophical systems and inspired by them</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.200" end="00:41:05.480" style="s2"> The Soviet system is based on rational philosophy and IQ</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.060" end="00:41:10.880" style="s2"> Contrary to the West</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.820" end="00:41:15.940" style="s2"> Each system builds a society according to its ideas</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.560" end="00:41:20.240" style="s2"> I have been involved in political science for quite some time</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.260" end="00:41:25.540" style="s2"> Political scientists and economists agree</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.400" end="00:41:29.560" style="s2"> People compete for resources</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.220" end="00:41:37.300" style="s2"> But as far as I am concerned, this is not a very good answer, because it is not clear why people think resources are valuable</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.980" end="00:41:42.020" style="s2"> Economists just assume that resources are valuable to you</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.020" end="00:41:44.940" style="s2"> But in fact, what people think of as valuable is different</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.940" end="00:41:50.180" style="s2"> Not completely fixed, maybe you tend to think that food is of high value when you are hungry</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.180" end="00:41:53.040" style="s2"> But a lot of things we think have great value are a bit arbitrary, just like making a data</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.360" end="00:41:57.660" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:41:58.160" end="00:42:03.000" style="s2"> I am very interested in why people give value to something and what makes something valuable</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.000" end="00:42:05.860" style="s2"> Why believe certain things</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.220" end="00:42:07.780" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:42:08.600" end="00:42:12.600" style="s2"> How to make certain people believe in certain things,</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.980" end="00:42:15.360" style="s2"> Even risking his life to protect it</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.400" end="00:42:18.920" style="s2"> At least risking other people&#39;s lives</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.380" end="00:42:25.220" style="s2"> Maybe in the bigger picture, people finally have their own system</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.820" end="00:42:32.820" style="s2"> Belief system is not just a belief system, I started to understand it is not very appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.940" end="00:42:36.060" style="s2"> Too psychological</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.480" end="00:42:39.760" style="s2"> People will defend their belief system, this understanding is not completely correct</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.860" end="00:42:41.860" style="s2"> We have a shared belief system</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.520" end="00:42:45.960" style="s2"> Today’s phenomenon is due to its full sharing</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.960" end="00:42:49.220" style="s2"> We don’t know each other, we are a group of primates</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.180" end="00:42:53.940" style="s2"> We are in the same room and very peaceful, no one is frightened</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.940" end="00:42:58.360" style="s2"> It’s amazing, it shows that we all play our role</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.840" end="00:43:04.120" style="s2"> There are certain expectations for these roles</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.200" end="00:43:06.120" style="s2"> Matching the two is very important</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.560" end="00:43:09.720" style="s2"> We will discuss this in detail</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.720" end="00:43:13.960" style="s2"> This is not a belief system,</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.960" end="00:43:19.760" style="s2"> Even if it can match the actions of other people in the belief system</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.760" end="00:43:21.800" style="s2"> What you need to maintain is this match</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.960" end="00:43:24.040" style="s2"> You need to live your faith in the world</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.640" end="00:43:28.040" style="s2"> You want what you want to come true</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.040" end="00:43:32.500" style="s2"> It’s a good thing, you get what you want, you confirm your belief system, it’s good</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.140" end="00:43:34.420" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:43:34.640" end="00:43:38.240" style="s2"> But more often, we interact with each other, such as now</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.240" end="00:43:43.040" style="s2"> A series of expectations to pay and regulate our current behavior</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.040" end="00:43:46.080" style="s2"> For example, you don’t want me to take your tablet and break it,</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.080" end="00:43:48.700" style="s2"> This is shocking, you don&#39;t know what to do</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.700" end="00:43:51.840" style="s2"> Your situation will be different</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.400" end="00:43:54.940" style="s2"> You don&#39;t know where you are</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.380" end="00:43:57.560" style="s2"> This is another thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.440" end="00:44:01.920" style="s2"> Because there is a fundamental difference between being in a known and unknown environment,</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.260" end="00:44:04.320" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:44:04.820" end="00:44:06.740" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:44:06.740" end="00:44:12.160" style="s2"> You can think of this difference as the difference between the known and the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.160" end="00:44:15.960" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:44:21.980" end="00:44:26.140" style="s2"> If you bring a cat to a new house, the cat hates the new environment</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.040" end="00:44:33.120" style="s2"> Because in and around the old house, they have already inspected the surroundings</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.120" end="00:44:35.820" style="s2"> Check everywhere along the edge</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.400" end="00:44:38.180" style="s2"> Scared at first</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.640" end="00:44:43.440" style="s2"> They check everywhere, where they can hide, where they are safe</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.440" end="00:44:45.160" style="s2"> Because they went to these places and nothing happened</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.160" end="00:44:47.800" style="s2"> Think these places are safe</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.800" end="00:44:52.540" style="s2"> They slowly establish a comfortable neighborhood relationship</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.540" end="00:44:57.740" style="s2"> My dad used to take the dog for a walk. The cat was a little bored, so he followed him</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.740" end="00:45:01.460" style="s2"> Start along the house, around the building</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.480" end="00:45:05.140" style="s2"> Hide, then make hunting moves</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.960" end="00:45:10.060" style="s2"> After a while, the cat felt relieved and followed behind the dog</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.280" end="00:45:12.900" style="s2"> But he still has boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.980" end="00:45:18.100" style="s2"> If my dad took the dog from one block to more blocks,</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.140" end="00:45:20.600" style="s2"> The cat is sitting on the corner and crying</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.260" end="00:45:24.060" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:45:24.800" end="00:45:29.200" style="s2"> It’s like saying that I don’t want to go further, where I don’t understand</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.640" end="00:45:30.140" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:45:30.140" end="00:45:31.600" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:45:31.700" end="00:45:36.100" style="s2"> The difference between the areas that can be controlled and the areas that cannot be controlled is a fundamental difference</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.100" end="00:45:40.220" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:45:40.280" end="00:45:44.980" style="s2"> It&#39;s like the difference between home and strange unknown territory</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.980" end="00:45:51.320" style="s2"> Regarding the fields that people are familiar with, no one is more familiar than others</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.320" end="00:45:52.600" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:45:52.600" end="00:45:55.760" style="s2"> Because humans are social</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.760" end="00:46:01.800" style="s2"> Don’t understand territories too abstractly. Territory does not only refer to geographical and objective territory.</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.200" end="00:46:05.080" style="s2"> There are also levels within the territory</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.080" end="00:46:07.840" style="s2"> And the hierarchical structure has a predictable structure</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.840" end="00:46:10.120" style="s2"> Most of the time you know where you are best</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.120" end="00:46:14.020" style="s2"> So when you practice in it,</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.020" end="00:46:15.900" style="s2"> Usually get what you want</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.900" end="00:46:18.620" style="s2"> You are also excited about it</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.160" end="00:46:22.160" style="s2"> No one wants to be unstable around</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.160" end="00:46:25.180" style="s2"> Like you are walking somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.180" end="00:46:29.900" style="s2"> The people around should be very organized, but</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.900" end="00:46:35.360" style="s2"> We reorganize everyone and give them freedom</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.520" end="00:46:40.760" style="s2"> As a result, pain and dysfunction will appear. This is the consequence of absolute freedom.</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.760" end="00:46:43.940" style="s2"> When you pass by someone, he is muttering</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.120" end="00:46:49.120" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:46:50.860" end="00:46:54.380" style="s2"> Maybe something has been hit</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.320" end="00:46:56.920" style="s2"> When you make eye contact</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.180" end="00:47:02.520" style="s2"> Even in a situation like crossing the road, it will definitely make the other person notice</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.820" end="00:47:05.640" style="s2"> Then you want to keep your distance and</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.640" end="00:47:08.980" style="s2"> Hope it didn&#39;t attract the other party&#39;s attention</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.980" end="00:47:11.460" style="s2"> Because he is not in your rank</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.460" end="00:47:14.120" style="s2"> You can&#39;t predict what he might do</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.540" end="00:47:17.060" style="s2"> This is also an unexplored territory</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.100" end="00:47:19.980" style="s2"> Another way to think about this problem is</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.660" end="00:47:26.340" style="s2"> We are in time and space, and it is neither pure space nor pure time.</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.860" end="00:47:30.780" style="s2"> We are here and now</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.460" end="00:47:33.200" style="s2"> It&#39;s safe</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.200" end="00:47:37.140" style="s2"> Part of the sense of security comes from the physical structure,</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.380" end="00:47:42.020" style="s2"> Also because none of you behaves strangely</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.720" end="00:47:46.080" style="s2"> If someone behaves strangely</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.480" end="00:47:49.680" style="s2"> Such as standing up and yelling</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.680" end="00:47:52.140" style="s2"> Or attack the person next to him</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.600" end="00:47:54.680" style="s2"> The rest will be petrified in an instant</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.960" end="00:47:58.220" style="s2"> Because I suddenly entered an unknown territory</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.900" end="00:48:04.020" style="s2"> What you want is a calm lesson and learn some knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.100" end="00:48:10.580" style="s2"> The match between what you expected and what actually happened suddenly disappeared</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.580" end="00:48:13.960" style="s2"> Then you don’t know where you are</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.680" end="00:48:17.320" style="s2"> Don&#39;t know how to act</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.080" end="00:48:20.060" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:48:20.420" end="00:48:22.640" style="s2"> If you are a computer, the current state is down</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.100" end="00:48:23.600" style="s2"> but</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.880" end="00:48:29.220" style="s2"> You realize you are dying, it doesn’t help</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.900" end="00:48:32.860" style="s2"> First you will freeze</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.940" end="00:48:38.860" style="s2"> Then maybe consciousness is restored, or not, eyes wandering around</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.860" end="00:48:41.200" style="s2"> Sit there hoping no one notices you</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.200" end="00:48:47.200" style="s2"> This is the reaction to being hunted, just like the rabbit thinks the fox is staring at him</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.200" end="00:48:49.380" style="s2"> Humans are prey for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.760" end="00:48:50.800" style="s2"> Recently discovered</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.280" end="00:48:56.880" style="s2"> Lower teeth and mouth of prehistoric cat</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.880" end="00:48:58.340" style="s2"> be found</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.340" end="00:49:04.820" style="s2"> It matches the human skull very well, so the cat can bite through the human skull with this lower tooth</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.960" end="00:49:10.220" style="s2"> This is how the lower teeth evolved</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.040" end="00:49:16.660" style="s2"> Under such circumstances we have evolved into predators</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.660" end="00:49:21.300" style="s2"> But we are delicious hunters, and other hunters are happy to eat us</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.060" end="00:49:27.980" style="s2"> So when we don’t know how to respond, we will behave like a predator</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.300" end="00:49:32.560" style="s2"> Maybe this should be done when you bow your head and don&#39;t speak</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.640" end="00:49:33.920" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:49:33.920" end="00:49:36.680" style="s2"> They won&#39;t notice you</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.680" end="00:49:38.640" style="s2"> Maybe you will survive</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.880" end="00:49:44.120" style="s2"> On the contrary, maybe you decide to take the initiative</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.960" end="00:49:46.440" style="s2"> Knock down</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.840" end="00:49:47.340" style="s2"> but</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.040" end="00:49:54.200" style="s2"> Maybe you will become the exception instead of the norm, which is not surprising</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.020" end="00:49:59.700" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:50:01.680" end="00:50:05.800" style="s2"> We begin to understand how the belief system manages emotions</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.420" end="00:50:10.260" style="s2"> But not all spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.260" end="00:50:16.400" style="s2"> This is a bit like territorial management theory, not that there is a theory in your brain</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.400" end="00:50:20.300" style="s2"> But that the theory explains the world</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.300" end="00:50:22.500" style="s2"> So make you safer</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.500" end="00:50:23.920" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:50:23.960" end="00:50:26.440" style="s2"> It’s more like you have the theory in your mind</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.440" end="00:50:29.580" style="s2"> It makes you feel safe because it can explain the world</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.580" end="00:50:33.760" style="s2"> As for why this can explain the world because other people have also formed corresponding theories</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.800" end="00:50:36.120" style="s2"> When you all practice the theory</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.300" end="00:50:41.480" style="s2"> You all got what you wanted, this is a synergy of theory</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.540" end="00:50:44.040" style="s2"> The result will form your (personality)</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.780" end="00:50:46.420" style="s2"> life</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.360" end="00:50:48.580" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:50:49.060" end="00:50:53.840" style="s2"> Prevents you from falling into anxiety and often makes you happy because you get what you want</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.840" end="00:50:58.680" style="s2"> This is not just a psychological theory, but a practice in our lives, we cooperate with other sociologists</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.680" end="00:51:02.580" style="s2"> We match the belief system and act accordingly</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.600" end="00:51:05.780" style="s2"> Form an exact and productive society</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.980" end="00:51:13.000" style="s2"> In fact, fear management theory (proposed by Jeff Greengerg et al.) not only protects you from death anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.100" end="00:51:15.900" style="s2"> At the same time saved your life</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.920" end="00:51:21.120" style="s2"> This is good, (you) are protected from death anxiety,</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.120" end="00:51:26.500" style="s2"> This is good, but not very good, the fundamental thing you are after is</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.140" end="00:51:30.660" style="s2"> People have reasons to protect their territories</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.660" end="00:51:36.940" style="s2"> If you regard every citizen’s behavior as a fundamentally hypothetical field</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.940" end="00:51:41.840" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:51:42.020" end="00:51:44.100" style="s2"> Then there is a reason to defend it</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.600" end="00:51:47.880" style="s2"> If it falls apart, there will be a series of deadly chain reactions</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.680" end="00:51:55.680" style="s2"> This is chaos, chaos cannot bring people a stable mental state,</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.680" end="00:51:59.120" style="s2"> Chaos makes everything unstable, such as currency</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.120" end="00:52:03.980" style="s2"> Industry, economy, and electricity will also stop supplying</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.460" end="00:52:05.600" style="s2"> This is not a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.080" end="00:52:06.720" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:52:07.720" end="00:52:10.020" style="s2"> No wonder people have to defend it</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.420" end="00:52:17.920" style="s2"> Then I started to study what the belief system is</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.880" end="00:52:20.600" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:52:23.480" end="00:52:27.480" style="s2"> I realized that the belief system is actually a series of moral codes</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.480" end="00:52:32.880" style="s2"> Guide you how you should act</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.160" end="00:52:35.140" style="s2"> How to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.440" end="00:52:37.920" style="s2"> Know why ethical codes are necessary for you</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.280" end="00:52:41.300" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:52:42.180" end="00:52:45.400" style="s2"> It’s because you can’t know anything out of the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.400" end="00:52:49.240" style="s2"> Think about it, how many things you can see in this room</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.580" end="00:52:53.320" style="s2"> You can see countless things</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.320" end="00:52:57.020" style="s2"> There are squares everywhere, such as small squares on the screen</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.020" end="00:53:02.000" style="s2"> You can take a closer look until the end of time, but you didn’t do it</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.400" end="00:53:05.200" style="s2"> In fact, if I ask most of you,</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.200" end="00:53:10.700" style="s2"> Very few people can tell me the color of the wall</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.700" end="00:53:12.820" style="s2"> Even something on the wall</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.420" end="00:53:17.120" style="s2"> The reason is that no one cares</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.880" end="00:53:20.240" style="s2"> Wall won&#39;t move</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.240" end="00:53:23.420" style="s2"> I don’t want to care about the color, you have no reason to remember these</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.640" end="00:53:25.880" style="s2"> There is no emotional mark</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.060" end="00:53:27.520" style="s2"> No value</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.900" end="00:53:29.740" style="s2"> So what you would do is</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.220" end="00:53:34.080" style="s2"> This is what you are doing now, why are you here</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.080" end="00:53:40.120" style="s2"> Not a metaphysical philosophical question, but the specific reason why you are here</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.700" end="00:53:43.380" style="s2"> Obviously you are students</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.380" end="00:53:45.760" style="s2"> Want to get a degree</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.760" end="00:53:48.940" style="s2"> And believe that the degree has practical uses</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.940" end="00:53:51.960" style="s2"> Maybe you are a little smarter</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.960" end="00:53:57.980" style="s2"> Be good at thinking and writing better, which will make you more useful in the world</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.000" end="00:53:59.200" style="s2"> This is a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.200" end="00:54:02.860" style="s2"> Maybe you are interested, anyway</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.680" end="00:54:09.000" style="s2"> Now you are listening to this course</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.000" end="00:54:11.740" style="s2"> To get the corresponding degree</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.740" end="00:54:16.500" style="s2"> Then you can take care of your own life and meet someone who can build a long-term relationship</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.500" end="00:54:21.700" style="s2"> Get married and have children, and share corresponding roles in society</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.120" end="00:54:27.480" style="s2"> This is why you are here, all these reasons work together</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.840" end="00:54:28.640" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:54:28.640" end="00:54:30.900" style="s2"> This helps you decide what to focus on</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.320" end="00:54:33.140" style="s2"> So you are watching or listening to my lecture</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.900" end="00:54:38.620" style="s2"> Because in principle</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.400" end="00:54:44.520" style="s2"> At this moment I am a door leading to this series of life settings</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.080" end="00:54:46.020" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:54:46.920" end="00:54:48.140" style="s2"> So your attention is on me</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.480" end="00:54:51.060" style="s2"> This is why you think this is valuable</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.580" end="00:54:55.660" style="s2"> This means that without a value structure, you have no way of looking at the world</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.360" end="00:55:01.180" style="s2"> That is chaos, if everything is equally important or equally unimportant</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.940" end="00:55:05.960" style="s2"> This is confusion, so the value prompt,</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.960" end="00:55:09.880" style="s2"> To provide you with a way to recognize the world, this is not an abstract concept</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.880" end="00:55:12.520" style="s2"> There are enough experimental instructions</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.520" end="00:55:18.140" style="s2"> For example, the invisible gorilla experiment, how many of you guide this experiment, how many have not seen it</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.720" end="00:55:21.560" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:55:23.700" end="00:55:27.220" style="s2"> Roughly speaking, there are two teams</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.220" end="00:55:30.380" style="s2"> The white team and the black team wear clothes of corresponding colors</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.380" end="00:55:33.840" style="s2"> The video shows the players of the black team and the white team passing each other non-stop</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.840" end="00:55:36.540" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:55:36.540" end="00:55:40.800" style="s2"> Ask you in advance to count how many times the basketball has been passed by the black team members</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.800" end="00:55:42.340" style="s2"> Only one basketball</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.900" end="00:55:44.660" style="s2"> For whatever reason you work hard</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.280" end="00:55:46.680" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:55:46.860" end="00:55:49.340" style="s2"> You do what the experimenter asks you to do</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.340" end="00:55:52.360" style="s2"> Count the number of passes</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.360" end="00:55:54.660" style="s2"> It’s actually not that difficult, probably 16 times</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.180" end="00:55:57.580" style="s2"> You tell them it is 16 this, they say</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.680" end="00:55:59.280" style="s2"> Did you see the chimpanzee just now</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.940" end="00:56:03.380" style="s2"> Half of the laboratory subjects said, what are you talking about?</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.020" end="00:56:07.640" style="s2"> The experimenter said, let’s watch the video again, this time without counting the balls</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.280" end="00:56:11.560" style="s2"> About 30s in the video</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.160" end="00:56:19.160" style="s2"> The players fill the screen and they are not far away, like a group of ants playing basketball</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.160" end="00:56:21.840" style="s2"> You can see their faces clearly</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.740" end="00:56:23.620" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:56:23.700" end="00:56:30.700" style="s2"> About 1 minute, there is a person wearing a chimpanzee costume, he and the chimpanzee costume are all normal human size</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.700" end="00:56:36.040" style="s2"> He walked into the screen and punched his chest in the middle of the screen for about 5 seconds, then disappeared from the screen</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.280" end="00:56:43.280" style="s2"> More than half of the people did not notice this detail. Worse still, Dan Simon did another laboratory</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.500" end="00:56:48.960" style="s2"> You make a checkout counter in a store, there is a teller</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.960" end="00:56:52.160" style="s2"> You talk to the teller, then the teller squatted down</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.700" end="00:56:56.640" style="s2"> Like looking for something, and then another teller stands up</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.940" end="00:56:59.620" style="s2"> You think you will definitely notice this</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.700" end="00:57:00.640" style="s2"> But not actually</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.560" end="00:57:04.440" style="s2"> Even the differences between the staff are more obvious</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.660" end="00:57:05.220" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:57:05.560" end="00:57:06.920" style="s2"> People will not notice</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.740" end="00:57:08.240" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:57:09.700" end="00:57:13.940" style="s2"> When our attention is focused on a particular thing, we will not notice the others, because the others are not important</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.040" end="00:57:15.660" style="s2"> What we are doing</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.180" end="00:57:18.040" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:57:18.200" end="00:57:20.100" style="s2"> The teller is replaceable</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.340" end="00:57:23.800" style="s2"> As long as they play the role of teller</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.240" end="00:57:25.520" style="s2"> that&#39;s enough</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.600" end="00:57:39.200" style="s2"> and so</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.200" end="00:57:45.420" style="s2"> Belief system makes your cognition and value system structure, which can also be called value system</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.420" end="00:57:47.320" style="s2"> Structure your perception</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.640" end="00:57:50.540" style="s2"> And guide your actions because</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.860" end="00:57:53.700" style="s2"> Your actions are consistent with your value system</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.700" end="00:58:00.420" style="s2"> Whether it is conscious or unconscious, the value system is working, you don’t know just because you don’t know yourself</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.680" end="00:58:06.800" style="s2"> It can also be said that you have a value system that you don’t know</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.800" end="00:58:11.420" style="s2"> Sometimes you know this is a mistake, but you still get attracted to some people</p>

<p begin="00:58:16.920" end="00:58:20.160" style="s2"> You can’t control yourself with the goal of getting a degree</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.160" end="00:58:25.540" style="s2"> The more unified you are, the more you can control yourself, but you are more like a series of loose</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.540" end="00:58:30.960" style="s2"> Sub-personality that can argue with each other, more or less pointing to the same goal</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.960" end="00:58:36.860" style="s2"> But it depends on how much you want to achieve this goal, how carefully you think about it, and how possible it is</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.860" end="00:58:43.120" style="s2"> How many contradictions in your life have you ever eliminated,</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.080" end="00:58:44.700" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:58:45.860" end="00:58:48.740" style="s2"> In any case, the value system governs</p>

<p begin="00:58:56.060" end="00:59:00.720" style="s2"> Learn a way of cognition, a very typical way of cognition</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.720" end="00:59:03.040" style="s2"> The typical meaning is</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.120" end="00:59:05.780" style="s2"> We will based on our expectation that our experience is true</p>

<p begin="00:59:10.340" end="00:59:17.340" style="s2"> In this way, the subject cannot be distinguished from the subject. This is not the way to be expected to work.</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.340" end="00:59:20.820" style="s2"> It’s more like you are doing a laboratory, including pain</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.820" end="00:59:23.580" style="s2"> Pain is not objective, but</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.180" end="00:59:29.460" style="s2"> The pain is real, one thing I understand is</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.500" end="00:59:33.660" style="s2"> You don&#39;t have to believe what I said</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.040" end="00:59:37.000" style="s2"> If you want to debate this</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.740" end="00:59:41.660" style="s2"> Why some parts don&#39;t make sense</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.820" end="00:59:50.720" style="s2"> From the thinking triggered by the person (on the street), what I want to express is, aside from basic assumptions, the conclusion I came up with</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.160" end="00:59:55.240" style="s2"> The conclusion has not been carefully confirmed, which does not mean</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.980" end="01:00:00.080" style="s2"> You can&#39;t try, you should try</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.640" end="01:00:05.680" style="s2"> Moral system</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.680" end="01:00:08.480" style="s2"> Tell you how to show what you see</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.640" end="01:00:15.900" style="s2"> The shared moral system keeps your emotions under control and satisfies your motivational needs</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.360" end="01:00:22.120" style="s2"> There is a David Hume</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.020" end="01:00:24.460" style="s2"> Old ideas</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.480" end="01:00:26.680" style="s2"> David. Hume</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.160" end="01:00:29.160" style="s2"> Very famous</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.320" end="01:00:34.960" style="s2"> He assumes that one thing cannot be assumed to be causally related to another</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.920" end="01:00:38.160" style="s2"> In other words, human beings only guide a few objective facts</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.620" end="01:00:42.140" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:00:43.080" end="01:00:46.920" style="s2"> Does not guide its application in life</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.980" end="01:00:52.420" style="s2"> There is a gap in between, maybe you would say</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.420" end="01:00:56.900" style="s2"> This is necessary for scientific work</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.900" end="01:01:03.200" style="s2"> One of the jobs of scientists is to strip the value of the object,</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.460" end="01:01:07.740" style="s2"> Because I don’t care about the particularity of the object to the individual</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.900" end="01:01:11.220" style="s2"> I want to understand how you perceive the object</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.220" end="01:01:14.820" style="s2"> It’s possible that everyone at least knows that</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.820" end="01:01:18.800" style="s2"> This can completely remove subjectivity,</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.800" end="01:01:21.460" style="s2"> This may just be a consequence of the scientific method</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.540" end="01:01:24.580" style="s2"> No moral orientation</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.840" end="01:01:32.080" style="s2"> People debate this, such as Sam Harris, scientific ethics are born</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.980" end="01:01:41.860" style="s2"> I don’t believe it, because I don’t think you can judge the value fairly, it’s too complicated</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.020" end="01:01:46.140" style="s2"> Value emerges by itself</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.540" end="01:01:56.140" style="s2"> Marxism puts forward the scientific utopia assertion, but it does not work in practice</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.980" end="01:01:59.860" style="s2"> In short</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.940" end="01:02:03.020" style="s2"> I agree with Hume in general</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.300" end="01:02:06.340" style="s2"> You can&#39;t say that one thing makes another thing</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.140" end="01:02:09.620" style="s2"> This is a problem</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.020" end="01:02:15.280" style="s2"> The first problem is that you have a set of facts, but you don’t know how to apply it.</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.280" end="01:02:20.920" style="s2"> For example, you should allocate money for AIDS or cancer or higher education</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.920" end="01:02:23.740" style="s2"> How to rationally calculate the pros and cons</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.740" end="01:02:27.580" style="s2"> There is no corresponding information as evidence</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.780" end="01:02:29.540" style="s2"> This is impossible</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.540" end="01:02:35.000" style="s2"> I used to work on the UN committee, the committee</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.540" end="01:02:43.500" style="s2"> You have hundreds of proposals on how to improve the world, but they are not sorted</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.060" end="01:02:49.260" style="s2"> You have to start with something, which means you have to pick an important proposal (you think)</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.300" end="01:02:52.500" style="s2"> Obviously in your life</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.500" end="01:02:56.220" style="s2"> If everything is equally important, you will be at a loss</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.920" end="01:03:07.320" style="s2"> Well known</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.500" end="01:03:10.140" style="s2"> A very simple example is</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.440" end="01:03:14.560" style="s2"> At the dawn of the scientific revolution</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.340" end="01:03:17.020" style="s2"> A wedge</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.940" end="01:03:23.140" style="s2"> Has been inserted into the heart of science, this is the moral system that unites us</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.680" end="01:03:25.480" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:03:25.760" end="01:03:29.280" style="s2"> The system may be a racial system</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.480" end="01:03:34.880" style="s2"> Has been severely criticized by science</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.880" end="01:03:37.040" style="s2"> This is very efficient, very useful criticism</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.140" end="01:03:42.060" style="s2"> Even if you hold traditional beliefs</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.980" end="01:03:47.380" style="s2"> The scientific onslaught is no joke</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.280" end="01:03:48.940" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:03:50.800" end="01:03:53.680" style="s2"> This is a problem that exists so far</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.680" end="01:03:58.480" style="s2"> You still don&#39;t know how to act</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.680" end="01:04:02.680" style="s2"> The philosopher Nietzsche would say</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.980" end="01:04:06.580" style="s2"> In the West, we run on top of Christian anger</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.900" end="01:04:13.340" style="s2"> Christianity has ruled for more than a thousand years, 1500 years, to be precise</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.420" end="01:04:19.500" style="s2"> It has developed a whole set of moral system based on a series of physical hypotheses</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.660" end="01:04:22.060" style="s2"> And form a social organization</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.080" end="01:04:27.040" style="s2"> These social organizations are based on specific beliefs, such as</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.260" end="01:04:31.140" style="s2"> What I say next may sanctify everyone’s ideas</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.140" end="01:04:35.280" style="s2"> Certain assumptions are put into the law, and certain deep-seated</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.280" end="01:04:37.080" style="s2"> E.g. natural human rights</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.080" end="01:04:40.960" style="s2"> This is an idea that is regarded as valuable by individuals and the law</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.960" end="01:04:46.800" style="s2"> Even if you have committed a crime or should be condemned</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.620" end="01:04:49.220" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:04:49.220" end="01:04:53.840" style="s2"> It’s a miracle why people think so</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.080" end="01:04:55.440" style="s2"> Roughly speaking</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.440" end="01:05:01.120" style="s2"> Humans tend to blame others</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.120" end="01:05:05.560" style="s2"> Suppose someone is accused of doing bad things</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.560" end="01:05:08.100" style="s2"> Was stoned to death or did anything else to him</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.380" end="01:05:11.660" style="s2"> Assuming innocence before there is evidence of a crime, my goodness,</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.660" end="01:05:15.980" style="s2"> Everything does not happen automatically, this concept is among the best</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.060" end="01:05:21.100" style="s2"> I dare not imagine how this happened, which gave me Xing Que</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.760" end="01:05:23.160" style="s2"> Because for me</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.560" end="01:05:29.020" style="s2"> There are some valuable ideas (things) beyond any individual assumption</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.060" end="01:05:33.740" style="s2"> I will not ask him to make scientific assumptions</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.740" end="01:05:37.200" style="s2"> Because this concept is more basic and fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.380" end="01:05:38.980" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:05:39.340" end="01:05:46.340" style="s2"> It is not unreasonable to make laws that society assigns personal value</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.940" end="01:05:51.580" style="s2"> Voting is subject to individuals</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.580" end="01:05:55.900" style="s2"> The fact is indeed the case, which gives the people the supreme power,</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.900" end="01:05:58.240" style="s2"> Such a society seems to work</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.940" end="01:06:02.660" style="s2"> But it is not certain that it will still work in the next 300 years</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.680" end="01:06:08.440" style="s2"> It has worked at least for the past 500 years</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.320" end="01:06:13.960" style="s2"> It&#39;s working well now, I assume most of you</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.280" end="01:06:18.840" style="s2"> Happy that the law empowers individuals</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.840" end="01:06:21.940" style="s2"> You have the right</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.760" end="01:06:27.840" style="s2"> Natural human rights</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.000" end="01:06:30.600" style="s2"> Show your superman value step by step</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.600" end="01:06:35.400" style="s2"> This insight rooted in Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.400" end="01:06:38.000" style="s2"> This is also rooted in a series of metaphysical concepts</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.180" end="01:06:40.500" style="s2"> His point is</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.500" end="01:06:42.380" style="s2"> If these metaphysical ideas are destroyed</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.380" end="01:06:46.460" style="s2"> Destroyed all the foundation stones</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.080" end="01:06:50.360" style="s2"> It may still take a long time for the entire Faith Building to collapse</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.500" end="01:06:52.700" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:06:54.580" end="01:06:57.780" style="s2"> It’s hard to say whether he’s right</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.900" end="01:07:04.580" style="s2"> In my opinion, what happened when Nietzsche foretold the death of God</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.820" end="01:07:06.780" style="s2"> 19 actual late stage,</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.780" end="01:07:10.120" style="s2"> Western society oscillates between extreme trends</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.120" end="01:07:11.900" style="s2"> Such as Germany where the extreme left and extreme right coexist</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.260" end="01:07:13.320" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:07:13.640" end="01:07:15.000" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:07:15.660" end="01:07:17.300" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:07:17.540" end="01:07:20.820" style="s2"> Such as a democratic regime in a sense</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.520" end="01:07:26.240" style="s2"> Occupies the middle</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.800" end="01:07:27.300" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:07:30.980" end="01:07:34.500" style="s2"> There is no underlying metaphysical support, in my opinion</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.500" end="01:07:36.560" style="s2"> The regime is unsustainable</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.240" end="01:07:39.640" style="s2"> This is a problem because</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.440" end="01:07:43.800" style="s2"> No matter how you look at the underlying metaphysical ideas</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.100" end="01:07:47.820" style="s2"> The scientific method is true is not correct in itself</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.820" end="01:07:53.300" style="s2"> Because there is more than one kind of truth</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.100" end="01:07:56.900" style="s2"> I think there is a pragmatic truth</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.900" end="01:08:00.340" style="s2"> The truth is deeper than the truth of science</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.780" end="01:08:07.220" style="s2"> The truth of pragmatism makes your practice best,</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.200" end="01:08:14.760" style="s2"> Increase the possibility, roughly speaking, maximize your existence and replication</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.720" end="01:08:19.400" style="s2"> This is Darwin’s view, one of Darwin’s views</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.600" end="01:08:24.520" style="s2"> In my opinion, it is opposed to scientific materialism</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.480" end="01:08:30.680" style="s2"> Darwinism believes that there is no privilege to master knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.860" end="01:08:33.980" style="s2"> For example, people will die</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.980" end="01:08:37.740" style="s2"> If you know the world well, you will not die, in fact you will die</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.740" end="01:08:40.220" style="s2"> The knowledge you master can only make you live to 80</p>

<p begin="01:08:45.220" end="01:08:52.220" style="s2"> Maybe you will have children and they will survive</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.560" end="01:08:58.400" style="s2"> This is what evolution has done for 30 years</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.440" end="01:09:00.280" style="s2"> This is a pretty good solution</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.280" end="01:09:03.260" style="s2"> The program has good practicality, do we have better other practices</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.400" end="01:09:09.280" style="s2"> Our worldview is actually based on Darwinism</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.100" end="01:09:14.100" style="s2"> This may contain the truth of pragmatism</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.140" end="01:09:19.280" style="s2"> Instead of objective reality, pragmatic reality can be exploited</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.600" end="01:09:23.080" style="s2"> Make us alive, we care if we can live</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.760" end="01:09:26.080" style="s2"> We tend to use theory as a tool</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.080" end="01:09:28.540" style="s2"> It is possible</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.200" end="01:09:31.540" style="s2"> Tools can help us live</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.000" end="01:09:40.920" style="s2"> Recently I was reading Camille Paglia, one day</p>

<p begin="01:09:51.200" end="01:09:54.700" style="s2"> A classic modern feminist, even though she considers herself a feminist</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.800" end="01:09:58.800" style="s2"> Very smart, if you want to see how good someone’s eloquence is,</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.040" end="01:10:00.080" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:10:01.200" end="01:10:04.480" style="s2"> She is an expert in expression</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.460" end="01:10:10.100" style="s2"> You should read her book (video), in my opinion she is a bit fanatical,</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.100" end="01:10:15.040" style="s2"> She speaks quickly and coherently</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.360" end="01:10:19.940" style="s2"> Tore her opponent to pieces in the debate, she is very smart</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.640" end="01:10:27.640" style="s2"> One interesting thing she said is that she was influenced by some people, who happened to have influenced me.</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.640" end="01:10:31.980" style="s2"> She likes the origin and history of Eric Neumann’s consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.980" end="01:10:36.240" style="s2"> If you are interested in Jungian theory, I recommend this book</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.240" end="01:10:40.800" style="s2"> The book is a good introduction to the Jung school and the development of consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.920" end="01:10:41.420" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:10:44.440" end="01:10:48.600" style="s2"> And this book is based on the work of Jung and Joseph Cambell</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.600" end="01:10:54.100" style="s2"> And Mircea Eliade&#39;s, these are all criticized or ignored by postmodernism</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.920" end="01:11:00.320" style="s2"> Postmodernism believes that all humans have a central narrative</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.060" end="01:11:01.820" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:11:04.340" end="01:11:06.100" style="s2"> The center narrative</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.980" end="01:11:08.480" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:11:09.060" end="01:11:11.400" style="s2"> Is a necessary dramatic expression of the human value system</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.420" end="01:11:14.900" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:11:16.160" end="01:11:17.760" style="s2"> Rooted in our hearts</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.680" end="01:11:22.680" style="s2"> Form part of our nature, we have our nature as humans</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.980" end="01:11:26.400" style="s2"> We are not entirely shaped by culture</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.000" end="01:11:32.080" style="s2"> This is what postmodernism claims, the idea is dangerous</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.460" end="01:11:36.700" style="s2"> The danger lies in thinking that we are natural</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.140" end="01:11:41.340" style="s2"> Palia holds this view</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.100" end="01:11:48.900" style="s2"> The reason you came to university, you studied the humanities, or other possible reasons</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.060" end="01:11:50.200" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:11:51.440" end="01:11:55.480" style="s2"> It’s not about participating prematurely and criticizing and destroying something under the ignorant Qin Guang,</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.480" end="01:11:58.520" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:11:59.120" end="01:12:00.400" style="s2"> but</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.940" end="01:12:03.640" style="s2"> Study as much art, literature and poetry as possible</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.580" end="01:12:07.140" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:12:07.780" end="01:12:08.900" style="s2"> drama</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.160" end="01:12:11.200" style="s2"> Fiction</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.800" end="01:12:13.400" style="s2"> Rigorous thinking</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.660" end="01:12:16.780" style="s2"> All of these you can think of as</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.000" end="01:12:18.000" style="s2"> what?</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.620" end="01:12:20.700" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:12:21.300" end="01:12:25.340" style="s2"> This is the category of art, culture, music</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.340" end="01:12:30.140" style="s2"> We talk about music as if everyone loves it, or almost everyone</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.840" end="01:12:32.060" style="s2"> This is a mystery</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.060" end="01:12:34.100" style="s2"> You listen to music, it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.120" end="01:12:38.200" style="s2"> Music will make people survive quite dark times. Why?</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.000" end="01:12:41.080" style="s2"> The answer is not obvious,</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.080" end="01:12:45.700" style="s2"> Music plays an important role on specific occasions in many cultures</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.700" end="01:12:49.880" style="s2"> I think you may find the most beloved music in your time</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.880" end="01:12:54.060" style="s2"> I heard it between your 16-20 years old</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.060" end="01:12:55.840" style="s2"> Like your mark</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.940" end="01:12:59.060" style="s2"> May define a whole generation</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.480" end="01:13:03.160" style="s2"> Maybe in the past tribal period, it was more like</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.280" end="01:13:09.040" style="s2"> The tribal customs that you were taught,</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.100" end="01:13:13.220" style="s2"> Dancing to the music with a mask</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.220" end="01:13:18.260" style="s2"> At the same time, you are invited to such occasions</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.260" end="01:13:20.480" style="s2"> And play a certain role in it</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.480" end="01:13:25.820" style="s2"> It is not correct to regard this as a representation of the objective world of things.</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.160" end="01:13:28.620" style="s2"> This is an invitation to enter the drama</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.100" end="01:13:33.780" style="s2"> Now the question may be transformed into, is the drama real?</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.060" end="01:13:35.740" style="s2"> the answer is</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.860" end="01:13:38.180" style="s2"> It depends on the true definition</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.940" end="01:13:43.500" style="s2"> I think great dramas are more real than real, they are super real</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.440" end="01:13:45.260" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:13:49.680" end="01:13:54.240" style="s2"> Because it abstracts it out and provides general guidelines</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.240" end="01:14:00.460" style="s2"> Used in a very wide range of situations</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.840" end="01:14:02.040" style="s2"> Let&#39;s imagine</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.040" end="01:14:03.800" style="s2"> You get up in the morning</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.480" end="01:14:06.060" style="s2"> Did a lot of things</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.060" end="01:14:09.380" style="s2"> Someone asks you what you are doing, what are you doing</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.060" end="01:14:14.960" style="s2"> You tell them to open their eyes first</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.960" end="01:14:18.900" style="s2"> Then I wonder if I should continue to sleep</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.900" end="01:14:22.540" style="s2"> Then lift the blanket and step on the floor</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.540" end="01:14:26.980" style="s2"> Stand up, blink and breathe while doing this</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.040" end="01:14:27.800" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:14:27.800" end="01:14:31.220" style="s2"> Then start looking for clothes. Do you really want to hear such an answer?</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.220" end="01:14:35.520" style="s2"> You don&#39;t want to listen, why are you telling me this?</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.520" end="01:14:37.820" style="s2"> I want to hear something interesting</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.700" end="01:14:42.300" style="s2"> What is interesting? And why are these things not interesting?</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.800" end="01:14:44.000" style="s2"> The answer is not obvious</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.000" end="01:14:49.160" style="s2"> Imagine this person tells you a very good story, a bit adventurous</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.900" end="01:14:51.100" style="s2"> Maybe</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.800" end="01:14:54.500" style="s2"> He is doing something very normal and something unusual has happened</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.700" end="01:14:57.260" style="s2"> He had to find a way to respond</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.260" end="01:15:01.080" style="s2"> Has he solved this problem? This is what interests you</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.260" end="01:15:05.660" style="s2"> Especially when he gets it done, because</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.300" end="01:15:09.000" style="s2"> When he tells you how he handles certain unexplored areas</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.160" end="01:15:11.400" style="s2"> He will also systematize it</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.820" end="01:15:14.540" style="s2"> Maybe when you encounter such a situation, you can handle it accordingly</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.540" end="01:15:18.580" style="s2"> This is quite cheap wisdom for you, he has to find a solution</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.580" end="01:15:20.720" style="s2"> All you have to do is listen</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.120" end="01:15:26.060" style="s2"> This is a classic story, roughly speaking</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.220" end="01:15:29.700" style="s2"> This kind of story is usually about a man or a woman, it doesn’t matter</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.020" end="01:15:31.540" style="s2"> Life is quite normal</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.940" end="01:15:36.900" style="s2"> Suddenly hit, they fell into chaos</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.040" end="01:15:38.640" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:15:39.800" end="01:15:41.200" style="s2"> Chaos is such a place</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.820" end="01:15:46.420" style="s2"> Stop what you are doing</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.240" end="01:15:54.240" style="s2"> The world no longer matches (with your cognition), chaos can be divided into many degrees, such as when you wake up</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.240" end="01:15:57.700" style="s2"> Found that your room was stolen, and your parents had Alzheimer’s disease,</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.860" end="01:16:01.260" style="s2"> Or some serious diseases</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.260" end="01:16:05.720" style="s2"> Or your family is murdered, the war begins,</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.580" end="01:16:09.440" style="s2"> There are many levels of confusion</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.660" end="01:16:11.180" style="s2"> You can</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.880" end="01:16:15.080" style="s2"> Judge the degree by calculating how much you were interrupted by the event</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.460" end="01:16:16.480" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:16:17.180" end="01:16:21.960" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:16:22.640" end="01:16:28.960" style="s2"> The higher the interruption, the higher the instability</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.960" end="01:16:33.720" style="s2"> This is why if someone tells you that you will be destroyed in pain within 3 months,</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.640" end="01:16:37.740" style="s2"> Is very bad</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.080" end="01:16:44.000" style="s2"> You are facing an unpredictable field, your original assumptions and ideas are not true</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.140" end="01:16:47.440" style="s2"> Generally speaking, the world is no longer real</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.460" end="01:16:52.420" style="s2"> We like to see people lead their usual lives</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.240" end="01:16:54.920" style="s2"> Blind to some things</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.780" end="01:17:01.740" style="s2"> Going through the transition period when it just entered a state of chaos,</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.820" end="01:17:03.660" style="s2"> Collect new information</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.660" end="01:17:09.440" style="s2"> Reshape their personality, or reshape the world, both are solutions</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.680" end="01:17:12.000" style="s2"> Then come out from the other side</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.400" end="01:17:14.580" style="s2"> Things are better than they were at the beginning</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.580" end="01:17:18.660" style="s2"> At least not bad, good results, right?</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.660" end="01:17:23.000" style="s2"> This is a good ending, comedy, technically</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.300" end="01:17:26.680" style="s2"> You want your life to be a comedy</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.060" end="01:17:29.860" style="s2"> But not funny</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.860" end="01:17:32.580" style="s2"> Because comedy doesn’t have to be funny,</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.580" end="01:17:34.440" style="s2"> Just the opposite of tragedy</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.440" end="01:17:39.360" style="s2"> The tragedy is that when you go through these things, you choose to blindly see, (seems) to handle it well</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.360" end="01:17:44.480" style="s2"> This situation does happen, at any time. But what you want is comedy</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.180" end="01:17:50.800" style="s2"> right now</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.820" end="01:17:53.820" style="s2"> I hope I can provide you with a magic code</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.080" end="01:17:57.440" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:17:59.140" end="01:18:02.340" style="s2"> A book was released a while ago</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.740" end="01:18:06.420" style="s2"> Movie starring Tom Hanks</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.640" end="01:18:11.360" style="s2"> He was a professor at Harvard University, solving symbol-related puzzles</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.360" end="01:18:13.140" style="s2"> Do you remember what this is called</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.520" end="01:18:17.240" style="s2"> Da Vinci Code, everyone loves it, this book is a big hit</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.760" end="01:18:23.400" style="s2"> It’s full of small mysteries and all kinds of hints. These hints about the world are beyond your imagination.</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.680" end="01:18:27.060" style="s2"> This is absolutely true</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.060" end="01:18:32.800" style="s2"> There are ways to learn this knowledge, and it&#39;s worth it</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.020" end="01:18:38.780" style="s2"> People like this idea because of its authenticity</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.760" end="01:18:40.520" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:18:42.300" end="01:18:43.400" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:18:44.200" end="01:18:48.040" style="s2"> Just like the novel is true, let’s go back to telling you what happened after you got up in the morning.</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.980" end="01:18:50.540" style="s2"> If he tells something exciting,</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.540" end="01:18:54.980" style="s2"> Imagine 10 people tell you something exciting</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.340" end="01:19:01.040" style="s2"> You will extract a picture of such things</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.040" end="01:19:05.000" style="s2"> Then when you are a writer, you will apply it to the book</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.980" end="01:19:10.380" style="s2"> In the book, you don’t want the plot to be about ordinary people</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.520" end="01:19:14.500" style="s2"> Doing normal things in their lives</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.100" end="01:19:19.800" style="s2"> You already know how to be an ordinary person, but it doesn’t help writing novels</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.800" end="01:19:23.240" style="s2"> After all, no one wants to watch a video about himself</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.240" end="01:19:28.460" style="s2"> Imagine you record your own day and watch it the next day</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.640" end="01:19:31.280" style="s2"> You will think, oh my god, who would want to watch this</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.800" end="01:19:35.320" style="s2"> So in the story they will refine</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.620" end="01:19:36.960" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:19:36.960" end="01:19:39.820" style="s2"> They observe people,</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.820" end="01:19:43.960" style="s2"> They told the story they saw, but removed most of the story</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.160" end="01:19:47.360" style="s2"> All the boring content is removed, hope so</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.580" end="01:19:50.780" style="s2"> Exciting story details stack up</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.780" end="01:19:56.140" style="s2"> Maybe a great writer was born and write some really interesting stories</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.560" end="01:19:59.120" style="s2"> Significant role transformation</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.120" end="01:20:00.540" style="s2"> And when you say it&#39;s fiction</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.540" end="01:20:02.360" style="s2"> You would say it&#39;s not true</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.540" end="01:20:03.980" style="s2"> Because he is fictitious</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.500" end="01:20:07.240" style="s2"> But this is not necessarily correct</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.280" end="01:20:11.020" style="s2"> Maybe more real</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.660" end="01:20:16.180" style="s2"> Because who wants truth, truth is ordinary reality, you have already mastered it</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.460" end="01:20:19.920" style="s2"> What you want is refined</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.340" end="01:20:22.020" style="s2"> Interesting experience</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.020" end="01:20:27.020" style="s2"> Maybe you will say, why is it interesting, this is a good question, because you are not really</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.020" end="01:20:31.920" style="s2"> Understand and believe me, you don’t know why you find meaningless things interesting</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.920" end="01:20:37.640" style="s2"> Today I will start with Pinocchio, I will talk more about it next time</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.640" end="01:20:43.000" style="s2"> I want to talk a little bit about how this movie started, and you will know how crazy you are</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.000" end="01:20:47.700" style="s2"> You all know the plot, how many of you have seen Pinocchio?</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.400" end="01:20:49.840" style="s2"> Many people</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.020" end="01:20:51.540" style="s2"> Many people have seen</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.600" end="01:20:54.320" style="s2"> This thing itself is quite strange</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.320" end="01:20:57.940" style="s2"> It’s worth thinking about, usually you tend to show such movies to children</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.260" end="01:21:00.900" style="s2"> But if you think about the movie content</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.300" end="01:21:05.900" style="s2"> I think it’s weird to sit down and watch this movie</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.180" end="01:21:10.040" style="s2"> First of all, this is a sketch animation with very low resolution</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.040" end="01:21:14.720" style="s2"> You don’t care, you may also watch the Simpsons</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.500" end="01:21:19.740" style="s2"> There is also a cartoon dedicated to mocking politics: South Park</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.940" end="01:21:23.380" style="s2"> The animation of this cartoon really sucks out of the sky</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.380" end="01:21:26.260" style="s2"> Yes, it sucks, it can&#39;t be worse</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.780" end="01:21:28.180" style="s2"> You don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.680" end="01:21:31.060" style="s2"> Round head,</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.060" end="01:21:34.760" style="s2"> Smiles and eyes like fans, you can only tell that this is a person</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.760" end="01:21:38.880" style="s2"> It’s all irrelevant, even if you use higher pixels, it won’t help.</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.880" end="01:21:41.060" style="s2"> You only need a summary,</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.200" end="01:21:43.180" style="s2"> To feel attached</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.900" end="01:21:44.540" style="s2"> therefore</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.740" end="01:21:49.500" style="s2"> You watch these animations, Pinocchio, very beautiful animations</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.000" end="01:21:51.520" style="s2"> play in order</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.520" end="01:21:55.520" style="s2"> You are not watching something real, you are watching purely broken structures</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.520" end="01:21:58.160" style="s2"> Recall the plot</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.160" end="01:22:02.060" style="s2"> Very ridiculous, everything is ridiculous</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.060" end="01:22:04.320" style="s2"> One character is insect</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.820" end="01:22:09.960" style="s2"> It feels like consciousness, what the hell is this?</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.420" end="01:22:15.380" style="s2"> Another character is a puppet, a marionette</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.860" end="01:22:21.340" style="s2"> For some reason he escaped from the rope and started an adventure</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.960" end="01:22:24.440" style="s2"> Then he was lured by a fox and a cat</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.520" end="01:22:26.180" style="s2"> To different evil places</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.680" end="01:22:29.080" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:22:29.380" end="01:22:32.540" style="s2"> Then he rescued his father from the whale</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.540" end="01:22:36.720" style="s2"> You don’t even know how his father got into the belly of a whale, the last time you saw his father</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.720" end="01:22:40.400" style="s2"> It was in heavy rain, and what happened next was that he was in the belly of a whale</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.400" end="01:22:43.700" style="s2"> You sit there and think, &quot;Hey, no problem, that makes sense.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.080" end="01:22:45.760" style="s2"> what? Really?</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.220" end="01:22:46.880" style="s2"> why?</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.240" end="01:22:48.920" style="s2"> Why does this make sense?</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.440" end="01:22:51.600" style="s2"> The answer is you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.020" end="01:22:54.100" style="s2"> This is cool</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.100" end="01:22:56.380" style="s2"> You don&#39;t know, you don&#39;t even know what you are looking at</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.700" end="01:22:58.140" style="s2"> But it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.140" end="01:23:02.260" style="s2"> You watch it and you are interested, you want to know what happened to this doll</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.260" end="01:23:05.180" style="s2"> Do you want to know if he eventually became a real boy</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.380" end="01:23:08.240" style="s2"> Because this looks important</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.200" end="01:23:13.600" style="s2"> You ask: Is Pinocchio real?</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.840" end="01:23:18.920" style="s2"> This is a stupid question</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.240" end="01:23:27.280" style="s2"> Because the answer is that it depends on how you define reality</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.520" end="01:23:29.140" style="s2"> and</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.180" end="01:23:32.800" style="s2"> The definition is not obvious to me</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.940" end="01:23:35.540" style="s2"> When you say something is true</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.480" end="01:23:37.200" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:23:38.300" end="01:23:40.200" style="s2"> What should you express</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.020" end="01:23:43.900" style="s2"> The answer is not obvious because</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.400" end="01:23:52.000" style="s2"> There is such a concept in our society and its influence is far-reaching. This concept is that the ultimate reality is the scientific reality.</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.120" end="01:23:57.360" style="s2"> This tells us the world itself, in some ways</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.360" end="01:24:02.060" style="s2"> Indeed, there is no objection</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.060" end="01:24:09.360" style="s2"> Physicists have discovered the correct law, which is why we can make hydrogen bombs. This is a strong evidence of scientific correctness.</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.140" end="01:24:16.680" style="s2"> But even if it’s true you don’t know how to practice</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.640" end="01:24:18.760" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:24:20.800" end="01:24:25.120" style="s2"> You observe things, are attracted and confused by them</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.120" end="01:24:27.840" style="s2"> No inference can be formed based on the known construction</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.960" end="01:24:33.940" style="s2"> to me</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.280" end="01:24:39.920" style="s2"> What the world is made of is a question, another bigger question is</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.920" end="01:24:43.780" style="s2"> How do you interpret yourself in the world</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.780" end="01:24:47.840" style="s2"> This is what you really want to know, more than any other question</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.840" end="01:24:53.280" style="s2"> Because you need to know, like you are in college now, but don’t know what you are doing</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.280" end="01:24:55.200" style="s2"> Some people know a little bit more than others</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.200" end="01:24:57.520" style="s2"> But you are still in the early days of life,</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.520" end="01:24:59.920" style="s2"> Life is very complicated and chaotic</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.920" end="01:25:03.440" style="s2"> It’s not obvious what kind of relationship you should build</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.440" end="01:25:05.780" style="s2"> What kind of personality should you shape</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.780" end="01:25:07.720" style="s2"> What kind of job do you want to do</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.720" end="01:25:12.120" style="s2"> Or what is the meaning of life, this is a good question, what is the meaning of life</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.120" end="01:25:18.460" style="s2"> As you know, people come to college, at least most, want to figure out the answer to this question</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.700" end="01:25:21.480" style="s2"> Now paglia, her opinion is</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.120" end="01:25:26.440" style="s2"> You should think like this, clear knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.340" end="01:25:31.060" style="s2"> Contained in unclear knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.760" end="01:25:34.920" style="s2"> The unclear knowledge is</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.520" end="01:25:39.120" style="s2"> Literary and artistic</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.420" end="01:25:42.300" style="s2"> High-level culture</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.000" end="01:25:46.320" style="s2"> We probably know what this means</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.320" end="01:25:50.280" style="s2"> But we can’t clearly know its meaning, its meaning is more than we know</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.300" end="01:25:53.940" style="s2"> The outside is the realm we all know</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.940" end="01:25:57.940" style="s2"> This is the point of view of Jungian theory, and perhaps Paglia got it from it</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.940" end="01:26:00.160" style="s2"> Because Jung believed</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.720" end="01:26:04.100" style="s2"> In any field, there are parts that we fully control</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.220" end="01:26:05.500" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:26:05.500" end="01:26:09.540" style="s2"> Beyond this you see it as an unexplored field</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.540" end="01:26:15.140" style="s2"> When our creative imagination meets the unknown,</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.140" end="01:26:18.000" style="s2"> We will use creative imagination</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.220" end="01:26:23.500" style="s2"> To figure out how to deal with the unknown, we created drama</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.880" end="01:26:29.560" style="s2"> And perform plays, which can help us deal with things that we can’t control</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.560" end="01:26:32.820" style="s2"> We know nothing outside of this field</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.940" end="01:26:38.060" style="s2"> Paglia’s view is also Jung’s view,</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.580" end="01:26:47.600" style="s2"> Don’t understand what’s around you will be too</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.260" end="01:26:51.620" style="s2"> Atomization</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.000" end="01:26:56.040" style="s2"> You are not part of your historical tradition</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.440" end="01:27:00.040" style="s2"> You haven&#39;t absorbed the spirit of your ancestors</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.440" end="01:27:01.760" style="s2"> Ancestors established all these traditions</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.400" end="01:27:04.800" style="s2"> You just exist in the present</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.600" end="01:27:06.420" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:27:06.420" end="01:27:11.320" style="s2"> You don’t know what to do, you don’t know how to maintain your tradition, and you don’t know how to serve it</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.660" end="01:27:12.360" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:27:12.360" end="01:27:15.820" style="s2"> You may ask why you should serve the traditional</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.820" end="01:27:19.680" style="s2"> I have an imaginary,</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.340" end="01:27:23.160" style="s2"> You can think of it this way, I don’t know if this is correct, but</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.320" end="01:27:27.320" style="s2"> The meaning of people’s lives, for me</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.140" end="01:27:33.220" style="s2"> The meaning is to take appropriate responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.200" end="01:27:36.120" style="s2"> You know, for example</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.300" end="01:27:39.940" style="s2"> You have a three year old sister</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.300" end="01:27:44.380" style="s2"> You have to take care of her</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.720" end="01:27:48.000" style="s2"> It seems silly to question whether this is a good idea</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.580" end="01:27:51.320" style="s2"> I mean, this is not a question to ask</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.340" end="01:27:54.340" style="s2"> obviously</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.520" end="01:27:58.160" style="s2"> Self-explanatory, this is what you have to do</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.320" end="01:28:01.680" style="s2"> Do you want to find meaning in it?</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.680" end="01:28:03.920" style="s2"> You are interacting with a child</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.600" end="01:28:08.840" style="s2"> When I have children, they are 2 years old or younger</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.840" end="01:28:10.660" style="s2"> We take them out for a relative</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.060" end="01:28:13.540" style="s2"> They are older</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.540" end="01:28:17.160" style="s2"> They looked at a 2-year-old child like a fire</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.140" end="01:28:21.980" style="s2"> Every second the child is in the house</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.220" end="01:28:24.080" style="s2"> Every adult</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.440" end="01:28:28.700" style="s2"> Are following them</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.180" end="01:28:34.140" style="s2"> This is what people tend to do</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.220" end="01:28:40.460" style="s2"> This is a certain meaning, what else is meaningful, your family members are meaningful to you</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.040" end="01:28:46.000" style="s2"> Maybe the sense of responsibility as a friend is also meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.020" end="01:28:50.820" style="s2"> Maybe you decide to pursue a career and become a useful person in society</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.860" end="01:28:53.480" style="s2"> Some of the dominant factors are</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.500" end="01:28:58.700" style="s2"> Because of your desire to be safe or to succeed, that makes sense</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.460" end="01:29:00.340" style="s2"> But you also</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.000" end="01:29:09.000" style="s2"> Need to play a complete role in the social structure, which supports you, my observation is</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.660" end="01:29:13.780" style="s2"> In my consultation process, when people have nothing to do</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.020" end="01:29:16.740" style="s2"> There is too much time to run out,</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.740" end="01:29:21.540" style="s2"> I have to go to work at 9:00 in the morning, the arrangements are very strict</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.760" end="01:29:29.760" style="s2"> Maybe I should be grateful for this, I noticed that when people break away from external system constraints</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.980" end="01:29:31.820" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:29:32.660" end="01:29:33.600" style="s2"> They are like floating</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.620" end="01:29:40.620" style="s2"> They will be depressed and restless, they don’t know what to do, just like sled dogs are not pulling a sled</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.300" end="01:29:48.020" style="s2"> We are like sled dogs, carrying weights, we need to carry weights</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.020" end="01:29:48.520" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:29:49.800" end="01:29:52.680" style="s2"> The question is what kind of load do we need</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.080" end="01:29:56.240" style="s2"> The reason we need is</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.540" end="01:29:59.740" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:29:59.740" end="01:30:03.580" style="s2"> I have thought about what the truth is for a long time,</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.580" end="01:30:05.500" style="s2"> Because i am an existentialist</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.500" end="01:30:11.580" style="s2"> My actions are based on the premise that you can infer what people believe by observing how people behave</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.920" end="01:30:13.480" style="s2"> I don&#39;t care what they say</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.800" end="01:30:19.460" style="s2"> I don’t care what they claim to be their opinion of truth</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.780" end="01:30:25.200" style="s2"> Because speaking and doing are directly related</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.560" end="01:30:29.320" style="s2"> Sometimes very low or even non-existent</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.900" end="01:30:33.700" style="s2"> One thing I noticed is</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.060" end="01:30:36.220" style="s2"> No one will argue with others about their pain</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.120" end="01:30:40.880" style="s2"> Everyone injured</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.860" end="01:30:44.500" style="s2"> Behave like they believe the pain is real</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.260" end="01:30:49.500" style="s2"> So we can say</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.280" end="01:30:52.200" style="s2"> The ultimate truth is pain</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.480" end="01:30:54.920" style="s2"> This is what people show</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.660" end="01:31:00.460" style="s2"> The claims in this multi-ethnic tradition are consistent</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.660" end="01:31:02.140" style="s2"> Jesus always</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.500" end="01:31:04.660" style="s2"> Recall the pain of the past</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.900" end="01:31:13.720" style="s2"> I mean that the God of Christianity was crucified. This is painful. For Buddhists, the most basic belief is that living is suffering.</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.720" end="01:31:17.040" style="s2"> In my opinion this is a philosophical view</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.440" end="01:31:19.520" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:31:20.740" end="01:31:22.060" style="s2"> This view holds that the pain is real</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.480" end="01:31:27.620" style="s2"> Of course it really depends on your definition of truth</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.460" end="01:31:33.020" style="s2"> But people always act as if the pain is real, this is a starting point for thinking about problems</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.460" end="01:31:39.840" style="s2"> Now this points to a problem</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.820" end="01:31:46.320" style="s2"> Life is painful</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.240" end="01:31:50.280" style="s2"> Life is miserable, why</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.260" end="01:31:54.820" style="s2"> Because you will get hurt</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.500" end="01:31:57.000" style="s2"> And destroyed</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.920" end="01:31:58.800" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:31:59.500" end="01:32:03.260" style="s2"> It seems self-explanatory, you know</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.640" end="01:32:08.040" style="s2"> It also makes people unique. This is our consciousness, right?</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.040" end="01:32:11.740" style="s2"> In a sense, this can really distinguish humans from other creatures.</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.740" end="01:32:16.080" style="s2"> I mean, some other creatures are also self-aware, like chimpanzees</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.080" end="01:32:19.420" style="s2"> You can learn to recognize yourself in a mirror, and so can dolphins</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.220" end="01:32:24.380" style="s2"> But this is a very conceptual sense of self</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.420" end="01:32:28.260" style="s2"> True self-awareness is to recognize one&#39;s own boundaries</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.260" end="01:32:32.440" style="s2"> Not only space, but also time</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.340" end="01:32:37.980" style="s2"> So far, humans are the only creatures that can discover the future</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.980" end="01:32:42.740" style="s2"> This is great because we can plan for the future, but it also has disadvantages</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.160" end="01:32:48.560" style="s2"> Because the future is limited, this is a big shock to the old system</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.240" end="01:32:55.580" style="s2"> Everyone bears and endures pain is a burden of reality</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.580" end="01:33:00.960" style="s2"> Then you think, life is suffering and finite, this is also part of suffering</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.960" end="01:33:04.080" style="s2"> This will prompt you to question the value of existence</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.800" end="01:33:08.080" style="s2"> Existence itself may be value</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.620" end="01:33:13.140" style="s2"> One of the weapons against the emptiness of existence</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.140" end="01:33:18.140" style="s2"> It’s the sense of responsibility we mentioned earlier, it feels feasible</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.760" end="01:33:24.720" style="s2"> How much responsibility do you take in your relationship with things</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.380" end="01:33:30.140" style="s2"> It looks like</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.760" end="01:33:39.600" style="s2"> It can improve your sense of meaning when you participate, maybe you will say, when is meaningful participation,</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.080" end="01:33:44.100" style="s2"> How about alleviating a little bit of suffering</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.460" end="01:33:46.800" style="s2"> You know, in your life this can be</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.540" end="01:33:51.760" style="s2"> Reduce unbearable pain, especially meaningless pain</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.760" end="01:33:57.920" style="s2"> This is a good thing, maybe you can be more useful,</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.260" end="01:34:01.860" style="s2"> You can solve some of your suffering and other people’s sufferings like hitting a home run,</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.040" end="01:34:10.040" style="s2"> Maybe you will find a way to heal you</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.060" end="01:34:17.060" style="s2"> If pain makes you question life, it makes sense</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.640" end="01:34:21.680" style="s2"> This end of pain</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.980" end="01:34:25.980" style="s2"> Minimize suffering</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.420" end="01:34:30.840" style="s2"> As a result of logical inference, it should be a suitable compromise</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.280" end="01:34:33.620" style="s2"> I would say it means</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.140" end="01:34:35.780" style="s2"> There are some patterns</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.540" end="01:34:41.780" style="s2"> Can make you immerse yourself in it and become a better person</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.320" end="01:34:43.020" style="s2"> and</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.080" end="01:34:46.000" style="s2"> One of the benefits of being a good person is</p>
<p begin="01:34:47.360" end="01:34:48.960" style="s2"> Can alleviate suffering</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.640" end="01:34:50.260" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:34:51.740" end="01:34:55.260" style="s2"> You should have no doubts here</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.260" end="01:34:59.740" style="s2"> If suffering itself makes you question the value of life</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.880" end="01:35:04.580" style="s2"> Then you can’t say it’s useless when the pain can end</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.580" end="01:35:10.100" style="s2"> You can say this, but it is actually inconsistent. If you want, you can declare the inconsistency.</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.200" end="01:35:16.920" style="s2"> I think</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.380" end="01:35:22.580" style="s2"> These refined stories</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.960" end="01:35:26.400" style="s2"> From a great author</p>
<p begin="01:35:27.160" end="01:35:29.800" style="s2"> I especially admire Dustoevsky</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.120" end="01:35:33.880" style="s2"> his job</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.460" end="01:35:39.620" style="s2"> He is the best novel among the authors I have read so far</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.300" end="01:35:46.240" style="s2"> No one can surpass, he can deal with the most difficult problems of mankind</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.560" end="01:35:47.060" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:35:47.880" end="01:35:48.620" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:35:48.780" end="01:35:54.420" style="s2"> He can simultaneously shape the argument of opposite roles, and indeed makes the debate fully revealed</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.540" end="01:35:57.260" style="s2"> This is not to say that Dostoyevsky</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.260" end="01:36:02.260" style="s2"> There is a concept, and then the concept of giving him the role, which makes this role always win the debate</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.260" end="01:36:04.820" style="s2"> This never happened in Dostoyevsky’s novels</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.820" end="01:36:08.540" style="s2"> You set the character, then set 3-4 opponents</p>
<p begin="01:36:08.540" end="01:36:12.340" style="s2"> These opponents are not scarecrows, they are like steel giants</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.440" end="01:36:18.540" style="s2"> They trample on the protagonist ruthlessly, this is a war of different ideas between the protagonist and the opponent</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.540" end="01:36:23.220" style="s2"> It&#39;s amazing to read</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.500" end="01:36:35.380" style="s2"> Great writers can distill stories</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.380" end="01:36:37.660" style="s2"> The great storyteller refines the story</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.660" end="01:36:41.180" style="s2"> Some stories are very very old</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.540" end="01:36:45.240" style="s2"> It is often religious stories in various forms, and some can also be myths</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.240" end="01:36:50.580" style="s2"> Because mythology can be traced back 10,000 years ago</p>
<p begin="01:36:50.580" end="01:36:52.920" style="s2"> This is part of oral tradition</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.060" end="01:36:57.500" style="s2"> Oral tradition can exist for thousands of years</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.500" end="01:37:04.200" style="s2"> If a story has been told for ten thousand years, it must be a very interesting story and people must remember it</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.320" end="01:37:12.280" style="s2"> Obviously it has also been modified. It&#39;s like a game of spreading. Let me tell you one thing. Tell you one with a laugh. Keep going.</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.520" end="01:37:18.480" style="s2"> Lasted for thousands of generations</p>
<p begin="01:37:18.480" end="01:37:24.980" style="s2"> The last part that people remember is the part they think is important, because people tend to remember what they think is important</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.980" end="01:37:29.920" style="s2"> What this means is not necessary for you, you don’t know the meaning of music</p>
<p begin="01:37:30.640" end="01:37:31.700" style="s2"> but</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.700" end="01:37:34.120" style="s2"> This is not preventing you from listening to music</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.120" end="01:37:39.240" style="s2"> You usually don’t know what a movie or book you’ve seen is talking about</p>
<p begin="01:37:39.240" end="01:37:43.400" style="s2"> Because they have multiple meanings, they are usually deeper than you can understand</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.400" end="01:37:44.760" style="s2"> Otherwise why read it</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.840" end="01:37:49.140" style="s2"> There is a view like this</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.840" end="01:37:56.520" style="s2"> You need to be rooted in the moral system, which is described by words</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.020" end="01:37:59.660" style="s2"> Can be drama</p>
<p begin="01:38:00.080" end="01:38:00.800" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:38:01.700" end="01:38:04.660" style="s2"> The moral system can guide us in life</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.660" end="01:38:08.000" style="s2"> The reason for understanding this is that at some level you can understand</p>
<p begin="01:38:08.180" end="01:38:10.660" style="s2"> Because you need to know how to survive</p>
<p begin="01:38:11.940" end="01:38:18.480" style="s2"> Nietzsche said if you have a problem and you can bear it</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.860" end="01:38:19.480" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:38:19.480" end="01:38:24.200" style="s2"> This is good, the guards of Auschwitz once did one thing to prisoners</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.440" end="01:38:28.840" style="s2"> It’s worth mentioning that there is a slogan in Auschwitz</p>
<p begin="01:38:28.840" end="01:38:30.920" style="s2"> Work makes you free</p>
<p begin="01:38:31.200" end="01:38:32.480" style="s2"> This is actually a joke</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.280" end="01:38:35.640" style="s2"> Not very funny</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.660" end="01:38:40.220" style="s2"> This is a joke that has to be evil</p>
<p begin="01:38:42.000" end="01:38:46.720" style="s2"> Conceptualize in a suitable time</p>
<p begin="01:38:46.980" end="01:38:48.560" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:38:50.160" end="01:38:51.480" style="s2"> Then be declared</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.220" end="01:38:57.340" style="s2"> When Osconsin’s range arrived, they were already in very bad condition</p>
<p begin="01:38:57.340" end="01:38:59.660" style="s2"> They were sent in a truck</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.660" end="01:39:03.080" style="s2"> They are classified with their families and deprived of everything</p>
<p begin="01:39:03.080" end="01:39:05.920" style="s2"> Tossing around for a long time and standing still</p>
<p begin="01:39:05.920" end="01:39:09.820" style="s2"> Because there is not enough space, the children have difficulty breathing and the space is very small</p>
<p begin="01:39:09.820" end="01:39:14.400" style="s2"> No food, no toilet</p>
<p begin="01:39:15.080" end="01:39:22.640" style="s2"> There is about 20% of the death rate during transportation, and people standing outside the livestock cart were frozen to death</p>
<p begin="01:39:22.640" end="01:39:23.240" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:39:23.700" end="01:39:24.760" style="s2"> Very cruel</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.940" end="01:39:30.460" style="s2"> When they arrive in Wisconsin, the guards will play this game</p>
<p begin="01:39:30.460" end="01:39:33.480" style="s2"> They will say that work makes you free</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.060" end="01:39:36.860" style="s2"> They will find a prisoner,</p>
<p begin="01:39:37.380" end="01:39:40.740" style="s2"> This prisoner is dying</p>
<p begin="01:39:40.760" end="01:39:44.360" style="s2"> Let them carry a sack of damp salt, about 100 pounds</p>
<p begin="01:39:44.360" end="01:39:45.800" style="s2"> From one end to the other</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.280" end="01:39:46.940" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:39:46.940" end="01:39:53.600" style="s2"> You might think that the prison is the size of a football field with protective nets around it, but it’s not</p>
<p begin="01:39:53.600" end="01:39:57.720" style="s2"> This is like a city, there are thousands of people</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.720" end="01:40:01.580" style="s2"> It’s a long walk from one end to the other.</p>
<p begin="01:40:01.580" end="01:40:07.100" style="s2"> This is not bad enough, they have to move the bag of salt to the starting point</p>
<p begin="01:40:08.880" end="01:40:09.620" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:40:13.360" end="01:40:23.240" style="s2"> To this malicious poetic statement is what is being done</p>
<p begin="01:40:24.200" end="01:40:28.120" style="s2"> Is to use human force for useful activities</p>
<p begin="01:40:28.320" end="01:40:35.520" style="s2"> It&#39;s okay to skim away the difficulties</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.460" end="01:40:41.220" style="s2"> Looks like this is a bad thing</p>
<p begin="01:40:45.500" end="01:40:46.860" style="s2"> People need</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.620" end="01:40:50.520" style="s2"> Meaningless parody,</p>
<p begin="01:40:50.940" end="01:40:54.960" style="s2"> People need meaning because life is hard</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.100" end="01:40:57.560" style="s2"> Problem makes</p>
<p begin="01:40:57.560" end="01:41:00.000" style="s2"> What is your purpose in life</p>
<p begin="01:41:00.700" end="01:41:03.660" style="s2"> Another question may be, does it matter whether the word is interesting</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.060" end="01:41:10.440" style="s2"> Because what matters is what matters, but what matters is what matters</p>
<p begin="01:41:11.680" end="01:41:15.760" style="s2"> I think what matters is more real than what matters</p>
<p begin="01:41:15.760" end="01:41:21.500" style="s2"> At least you behaved like this, then the question is, should you set a goal?</p>
<p begin="01:41:22.380" end="01:41:26.620" style="s2"> This is a good question, this question is about the meaning of life</p>
<p begin="01:41:26.620" end="01:41:31.580" style="s2"> One thing that should happen when you come to university</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.580" end="01:41:34.380" style="s2"> Yes basically find the answer to this kind of question</p>
<p begin="01:41:34.440" end="01:41:35.880" style="s2"> so far</p>
<p begin="01:41:36.520" end="01:41:43.520" style="s2"> Maybe I’m too cynical, the college students I saw,</p>
<p begin="01:41:44.040" end="01:41:46.840" style="s2"> Attached to the remains of their culture</p>
<p begin="01:41:47.600" end="01:41:48.100" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:41:48.680" end="01:41:51.280" style="s2"> Floating around like fragments</p>
<p begin="01:41:52.680" end="01:41:55.180" style="s2"> These fragments will be taken away by the professors who told them that anything can be broken,</p>
<p begin="01:41:56.920" end="01:41:58.600" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:41:59.600" end="01:42:05.160" style="s2"> No, these ideas have no practical meaning</p>
<p begin="01:42:05.160" end="01:42:09.480" style="s2"> When you finally graduated, it was like duckweed flowing to the ocean, you left nothing</p>
<p begin="01:42:09.480" end="01:42:13.220" style="s2"> You&#39;re done, you can graduate</p>
<p begin="01:42:17.540" end="01:42:19.900" style="s2"> But i don&#39;t see anything useful in it</p>
<p begin="01:42:21.100" end="01:42:22.540" style="s2"> In contrast to</p>
<p begin="01:42:31.020" end="01:42:32.700" style="s2"> I tell you a story</p>
<p begin="01:42:38.380" end="01:42:43.740" style="s2"> First of all, I’m going to give you suggestions, which we will elaborate on</p>
<p begin="01:42:43.800" end="01:42:46.440" style="s2"> You live in a story, through the frame of the story</p>
<p begin="01:42:46.440" end="01:42:50.560" style="s2"> Looking at the world, it’s like a story,</p>
<p begin="01:42:51.400" end="01:42:53.400" style="s2"> When this story is where you are</p>
<p begin="01:42:53.400" end="01:42:55.100" style="s2"> And you are going to somewhere else</p>
<p begin="01:42:55.100" end="01:42:57.640" style="s2"> This can be conceptualized,</p>
<p begin="01:42:57.640" end="01:43:01.300" style="s2"> There is a gradient between where you want to go and your goal,</p>
<p begin="01:43:01.300" end="01:43:04.700" style="s2"> What are you doing when you sit there</p>
<p begin="01:43:04.720" end="01:43:08.480" style="s2"> Assuming your goal is better things</p>
<p begin="01:43:08.480" end="01:43:11.280" style="s2"> Usually you are in an insufficient state</p>
<p begin="01:43:11.600" end="01:43:12.420" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:43:13.360" end="01:43:15.100" style="s2"> Insufficiency changes</p>
<p begin="01:43:15.100" end="01:43:18.520" style="s2"> Then you try to correct the deficiency</p>
<p begin="01:43:18.520" end="01:43:22.540" style="s2"> It is generally believed that your current state is always not as good as the state you want to achieve</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.180" end="01:43:25.680" style="s2"> Usually the way you bridge the gap is</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.200" end="01:43:30.080" style="s2"> Sometimes you can think</p>
<p begin="01:43:30.080" end="01:43:32.600" style="s2"> But the more essential situation is through practice</p>
<p begin="01:43:32.600" end="01:43:35.160" style="s2"> You through practice in the world</p>
<p begin="01:43:35.160" end="01:43:39.000" style="s2"> This can partially answer the mind-body question</p>
<p begin="01:43:39.000" end="01:43:43.600" style="s2"> You have a conceptual structure and when you apply it</p>
<p begin="01:43:43.600" end="01:43:47.260" style="s2"> It is not abstract, you use it through practice</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.520" end="01:43:51.360" style="s2"> This is the most basic story, not so attractive</p>
<p begin="01:43:51.360" end="01:43:56.380" style="s2"> But this is a framework for you to see the world, a framework that carries value</p>
<p begin="01:43:56.380" end="01:43:59.300" style="s2"> Otherwise you can’t practice and you can’t understand how to look at (the world)</p>
<p begin="01:43:59.540" end="01:44:01.820" style="s2"> This is a value-laden framework</p>
<p begin="01:44:01.820" end="01:44:07.340" style="s2"> Through this framework, we can say what is the starting point of the best value framework</p>
<p begin="01:44:07.340" end="01:44:09.980" style="s2"> This is the problem we are trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="01:44:11.200" end="01:44:15.300" style="s2"> Now I’m going to talk about the war between the communists and the western world.</p>
<p begin="01:44:15.800" end="01:44:19.900" style="s2"> Why does it attract me</p>
<p begin="01:44:20.200" end="01:44:22.080" style="s2"> One thing is</p>
<p begin="01:44:22.080" end="01:44:25.860" style="s2"> I really want to know about autocracy</p>
<p begin="01:44:25.860" end="01:44:29.140" style="s2"> Similar to communists and the West, there are certain axioms</p>
<p begin="01:44:29.140" end="01:44:31.880" style="s2"> If you are a moral relativist, you might say</p>
<p begin="01:44:31.880" end="01:44:34.560" style="s2"> A certain type of axiom set is better</p>
<p begin="01:44:34.600" end="01:44:40.440" style="s2"> Even, think that a series of axioms, one system is better than another</p>
<p begin="01:44:41.320" end="01:44:45.160" style="s2"> This is the point of view of a moral relativist, and you know</p>
<p begin="01:44:49.500" end="01:44:55.500" style="s2"> So before I thought it might be more arbitrary by force</p>
<p begin="01:44:55.500" end="01:44:59.520" style="s2"> This is how people deal with two competing systems (arbitrary statement)</p>
<p begin="01:44:59.520" end="01:45:01.620" style="s2"> No room for discussion and negotiation</p>
<p begin="01:45:01.620" end="01:45:04.740" style="s2"> I have been thinking about this for a long time, I want to know</p>
<p begin="01:45:04.740" end="01:45:10.480" style="s2"> Where are the roots of the Marxist system and the Western system</p>
<p begin="01:45:10.680" end="01:45:16.560" style="s2"> I guess the western system is formed after long-term evolution</p>
<p begin="01:45:17.040" end="01:45:22.320" style="s2"> And the communist system is imposed by rationalists</p>
<p begin="01:45:22.320" end="01:45:25.940" style="s2"> It&#39;s not the same thing, then i want to know</p>
<p begin="01:45:25.940" end="01:45:32.100" style="s2"> Where is Western culture rooted, and is there any reason why it is reasonable on any level?</p>
<p begin="01:45:32.600" end="01:45:33.260" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:45:34.340" end="01:45:38.900" style="s2"> This prompted me to study and learn the underlying story</p>
<p begin="01:45:38.900" end="01:45:43.820" style="s2"> Based on the basic stories of our culture, I believe that some of them are very old</p>
<p begin="01:45:43.820" end="01:45:49.580" style="s2"> Next, I will tell the story of Mesopotamia, which is one of the oldest stories we know, and the story of Egypt.</p>
<p begin="01:45:50.580" end="01:45:52.740" style="s2"> These are the origins of our culture</p>
<p begin="01:45:52.740" end="01:45:56.820" style="s2"> I think these stories are rooted in older traditions</p>
<p begin="01:45:56.820" end="01:45:59.260" style="s2"> They map some reality</p>
<p begin="01:45:59.680" end="01:46:01.680" style="s2"> Very real,</p>
<p begin="01:46:02.360" end="01:46:03.960" style="s2"> I mentioned before</p>
<p begin="01:46:04.940" end="01:46:08.300" style="s2"> There are different ways and concepts to understand the truth</p>
<p begin="01:46:08.980" end="01:46:14.300" style="s2"> My initial hypothesis is that you might also think it is an axiom</p>
<p begin="01:46:15.140" end="01:46:20.660" style="s2"> Pain is the most real, because this is how people behave.</p>
<p begin="01:46:21.320" end="01:46:23.160" style="s2"> You can criticize it</p>
<p begin="01:46:23.160" end="01:46:28.400" style="s2"> Of course you can also come up with other alternative conceptual frameworks, such as those used by scientists</p>
<p begin="01:46:28.400" end="01:46:30.740" style="s2"> Because they believe it is important to pursue the truth of things</p>
<p begin="01:46:32.960" end="01:46:36.580" style="s2"> Maybe we need more than one way to interpret the world</p>
<p begin="01:46:37.060" end="01:46:38.540" style="s2"> this is possible</p>
<p begin="01:46:44.540" end="01:46:48.140" style="s2"> Now what I want to say is what I think is the most essential</p>
<p begin="01:46:48.660" end="01:46:50.980" style="s2"> Elements that make up the story</p>
<p begin="01:46:51.640" end="01:46:52.800" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:46:54.100" end="01:46:56.740" style="s2"> I hope one of them is</p>
<p begin="01:46:57.720" end="01:47:01.160" style="s2"> Knowing it can make you</p>
<p begin="01:47:01.560" end="01:47:04.680" style="s2"> Immune to ideology</p>
<p begin="01:47:04.980" end="01:47:09.700" style="s2"> The reason is that I think ideology is intermittent and incomplete</p>
<p begin="01:47:09.820" end="01:47:13.580" style="s2"> Meta-narrative, the reason they have power is</p>
<p begin="01:47:13.580" end="01:47:16.900" style="s2"> They are rooted in meta-narratives, but they only tell part of the story</p>
<p begin="01:47:16.900" end="01:47:20.280" style="s2"> But they still have power because they are rooted in the essential narrative</p>
<p begin="01:47:20.560" end="01:47:25.120" style="s2"> Its characteristic is</p>
<p begin="01:47:25.420" end="01:47:26.940" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:47:27.660" end="01:47:32.140" style="s2"> People tend to characterize the world, we are social primates</p>
<p begin="01:47:32.140" end="01:47:37.440" style="s2"> We tend to see the world through the glasses of social roles</p>
<p begin="01:47:37.440" end="01:47:43.160" style="s2"> Because we practice in the world and the world is full of other people</p>
<p begin="01:47:43.160" end="01:47:45.720" style="s2"> So we conceptualized it into personality terms based on this structure,</p>
<p begin="01:47:46.400" end="01:47:49.880" style="s2"> To guide action</p>
<p begin="01:47:53.960" end="01:47:58.900" style="s2"> The most essential reality is chaos</p>
<p begin="01:47:59.600" end="01:48:03.220" style="s2"> You can&#39;t understand confusion</p>
<p begin="01:48:03.760" end="01:48:06.180" style="s2"> Settings cannot be conceptualized</p>
<p begin="01:48:06.900" end="01:48:09.180" style="s2"> You can only touch the edge of chaos</p>
<p begin="01:48:09.540" end="01:48:10.740" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:48:11.580" end="01:48:14.700" style="s2"> When the twin towers collapsed</p>
<p begin="01:48:14.800" end="01:48:18.560" style="s2"> The chaos occupied quite a while and everyone was in shock</p>
<p begin="01:48:19.400" end="01:48:23.240" style="s2"> This is chaos, it is your experience when your story falls apart</p>
<p begin="01:48:23.880" end="01:48:25.400" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:48:25.840" end="01:48:28.560" style="s2"> Fall under the unknown</p>
<p begin="01:48:28.560" end="01:48:34.300" style="s2"> This is chaos, basically you live in order and chaos, order is</p>
<p begin="01:48:34.300" end="01:48:38.120" style="s2"> You know what to do when and where, and you get what you want</p>
<p begin="01:48:38.120" end="01:48:40.680" style="s2"> Also known areas to be explored</p>
<p begin="01:48:40.820" end="01:48:44.180" style="s2"> Chaos is when you do something and hope for a certain result,</p>
<p begin="01:48:44.300" end="01:48:47.020" style="s2"> But it didn&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="01:48:47.020" end="01:48:50.920" style="s2"> At this point you will be in chaos</p>
<p begin="01:48:50.920" end="01:48:53.500" style="s2"> Chaos has different depths,</p>
<p begin="01:48:53.500" end="01:48:57.080" style="s2"> When chaos occurs, your life can fall apart very badly</p>
<p begin="01:48:57.240" end="01:48:59.760" style="s2"> , Like falling to hell</p>
<p begin="01:48:59.760" end="01:49:03.480" style="s2"> You are in chaos and realize that it is your own problem</p>
<p begin="01:49:03.780" end="01:49:05.940" style="s2"> You did something wrong</p>
<p begin="01:49:05.940" end="01:49:08.240" style="s2"> You know and ignored it</p>
<p begin="01:49:09.320" end="01:49:11.320" style="s2"> This is your bad mess</p>
<p begin="01:49:13.820" end="01:49:15.980" style="s2"> When chaos occurs</p>
<p begin="01:49:15.980" end="01:49:20.120" style="s2"> What followed is very straightforward</p>
<p begin="01:49:20.360" end="01:49:21.960" style="s2"> You can think of individuals in culture</p>
<p begin="01:49:22.020" end="01:49:24.260" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:49:24.260" end="01:49:26.040" style="s2"> Culture is contained in nature</p>
<p begin="01:49:26.040" end="01:49:30.980" style="s2"> Naturally matrilineal</p>
<p begin="01:49:30.980" end="01:49:32.480" style="s2"> Culture is patrilineal</p>
<p begin="01:49:32.480" end="01:49:36.520" style="s2"> I think this is because of the hierarchical structure of human nature</p>
<p begin="01:49:36.640" end="01:49:39.480" style="s2"> Is machismo</p>
<p begin="01:49:39.700" end="01:49:43.540" style="s2"> Nature is likened to a woman because</p>
<p begin="01:49:43.540" end="01:49:48.280" style="s2"> Two reasons, one is that all women play the role of sexual selection in human history</p>
<p begin="01:49:48.280" end="01:49:51.080" style="s2"> From the perspective of Darwinism</p>
<p begin="01:49:51.080" end="01:49:56.040" style="s2"> Second, because it is naturally biologically productive</p>
<p begin="01:49:56.040" end="01:50:01.360" style="s2"> We often conceptualize men and women</p>
<p begin="01:50:01.360" end="01:50:03.300" style="s2"> To organize the world</p>
<p begin="01:50:04.700" end="01:50:05.760" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:50:06.340" end="01:50:07.380" style="s2"> This is a metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:50:08.000" end="01:50:11.840" style="s2"> But far beyond metaphor, it is reasonable to compare culture to a picky father</p>
<p begin="01:50:11.840" end="01:50:16.140" style="s2"> because</p>
<p begin="01:50:16.200" end="01:50:16.760" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:50:17.900" end="01:50:24.220" style="s2"> Because a group of people gather around you, some are friends, some see how you work, some evaluate you</p>
<p begin="01:50:24.220" end="01:50:28.000" style="s2"> After a long time of evolution</p>
<p begin="01:50:28.600" end="01:50:32.680" style="s2"> These people accumulate to form an entity</p>
<p begin="01:50:32.680" end="01:50:35.120" style="s2"> Constantly review and criticize you</p>
<p begin="01:50:35.360" end="01:50:39.200" style="s2"> It is also reasonable to personify it</p>
<p begin="01:50:39.200" end="01:50:41.860" style="s2"> It’s like a Yuanren is watching you</p>
<p begin="01:50:42.380" end="01:50:43.340" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:50:43.340" end="01:50:47.580" style="s2"> This is a useful analogy, there is a meta-man who is watching you</p>
<p begin="01:50:47.640" end="01:50:49.720" style="s2"> Yes it is obvious</p>
<p begin="01:50:50.280" end="01:50:53.080" style="s2"> You can say it&#39;s not real</p>
<p begin="01:50:56.240" end="01:51:01.360" style="s2"> It’s not true on the scientific level, but it’s also another form of truth.</p>
<p begin="01:51:05.200" end="01:51:09.760" style="s2"> Nature has two elements, destruction and creation</p>
<p begin="01:51:09.860" end="01:51:12.980" style="s2"> Nature has a beautiful and generous side</p>
<p begin="01:51:13.020" end="01:51:14.460" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:51:15.760" end="01:51:20.420" style="s2"> It’s also Anopheles, Elephantiasis, Cancer</p>
<p begin="01:51:20.780" end="01:51:24.220" style="s2"> The terrible side of hunger</p>
<p begin="01:51:24.220" end="01:51:28.380" style="s2"> And culture is authoritarian</p>
<p begin="01:51:28.380" end="01:51:33.820" style="s2"> Because you have to shape yourself (to adapt to the culture), unconsciously get along with other people,</p>
<p begin="01:51:33.820" end="01:51:37.620" style="s2"> You have to sacrifice many parts of yourself and develop yourself</p>
<p begin="01:51:37.620" end="01:51:42.540" style="s2"> As a result, we have to balance ourselves to adapt to social life</p>
<p begin="01:51:42.540" end="01:51:47.160" style="s2"> Some societies are more authoritarian than others</p>
<p begin="01:51:47.160" end="01:51:51.640" style="s2"> But they all have authoritarian elements, and it’s no exception on college campuses, you all know</p>

<p begin="01:51:53.540" end="01:51:58.060" style="s2"> It’s easy to feel like you’re overwhelmed like numbers, it doesn’t matter whether you are here or not</p>
<p begin="01:51:58.060" end="01:52:02.300" style="s2"> The school doesn’t care, it’s authoritarian</p>
<p begin="01:52:02.300" end="01:52:05.800" style="s2"> But the school cares because you are here and you are receiving education</p>
<p begin="01:52:05.800" end="01:52:07.460" style="s2"> Maybe this is the positive side</p>
<p begin="01:52:08.020" end="01:52:12.940" style="s2"> Each feature has two sides</p>
<p begin="01:52:13.280" end="01:52:17.520" style="s2"> Nature has positive and negative properties</p>
<p begin="01:52:17.520" end="01:52:22.400" style="s2"> Culture also has a positive and negative nature, including individual</p>
<p begin="01:52:22.400" end="01:52:26.520" style="s2"> The individual is like standing on an island in the center of the ocean</p>
<p begin="01:52:26.880" end="01:52:27.940" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:52:29.720" end="01:52:32.840" style="s2"> The place you are in has a positive concept</p>
<p begin="01:52:32.840" end="01:52:39.200" style="s2"> Solid ground, limited extension, other parts you don’t know</p>
<p begin="01:52:39.200" end="01:52:43.380" style="s2"> As an individual you also have positive and negative elements</p>
<p begin="01:52:43.380" end="01:52:45.540" style="s2"> There are heroes and villains</p>
<p begin="01:52:45.540" end="01:52:48.380" style="s2"> Of course, if there are no heroes and villains in the story, what else to see</p>
<p begin="01:52:48.380" end="01:52:54.840" style="s2"> The villain is the part that people show that should not be shown, the hero is the part that should be shown</p>
<p begin="01:52:54.840" end="01:52:59.140" style="s2"> When you watch a movie or read a book, there are heroes and villains in it</p>
<p begin="01:52:59.140" end="01:53:03.420" style="s2"> To some extent this will give you a concrete understanding of the villain</p>
<p begin="01:53:03.420" end="01:53:07.740" style="s2"> When you meet about 30 villains, you will have a conceptual understanding of what villain behavior is</p>
<p begin="01:53:07.900" end="01:53:10.540" style="s2"> This is the core element of the villain</p>
<p begin="01:53:10.620" end="01:53:11.920" style="s2"> No matter what</p>
<p begin="01:53:12.340" end="01:53:15.860" style="s2"> You can imagine building a meta villain for you</p>
<p begin="01:53:15.940" end="01:53:20.340" style="s2"> Or meta heroes, these are the characters in the old stories</p>
<p begin="01:53:21.020" end="01:53:24.220" style="s2"> in general</p>
<p begin="01:53:24.620" end="01:53:28.220" style="s2"> In the Marvel movie</p>
<p begin="01:53:29.140" end="01:53:32.240" style="s2"> There is Odin, he has two sons</p>
<p begin="01:53:32.520" end="01:53:35.320" style="s2"> Thor and Vulcan Loki,</p>
<p begin="01:53:41.040" end="01:53:47.520" style="s2"> Thor is a recognized hero, Vulcan is a liar who always wants to destroy everything</p>
<p begin="01:53:48.320" end="01:53:50.880" style="s2"> You can identify these by yourself</p>
<p begin="01:53:50.880" end="01:53:54.520" style="s2"> This is useful because even if you underestimate</p>
<p begin="01:53:54.640" end="01:53:57.580" style="s2"> [Student question] Is this a positive spirit?</p>
<p begin="01:53:57.660" end="01:54:01.420" style="s2"> No, this is a map of meaning</p>
<p begin="01:54:03.320" end="01:54:09.560" style="s2"> Positive spirit</p>
<p begin="01:54:09.700" end="01:54:13.380" style="s2"> Certainly not</p>
<p begin="01:54:17.660" end="01:54:19.580" style="s2"> Why might you become vicious?</p>
<p begin="01:54:21.740" end="01:54:24.140" style="s2"> First because you can</p>
<p begin="01:54:24.160" end="01:54:25.700" style="s2"> This is critical</p>
<p begin="01:54:26.100" end="01:54:29.300" style="s2"> This is actually a branch of empathy</p>
<p begin="01:54:29.560" end="01:54:33.000" style="s2"> It took me decades to figure out</p>
<p begin="01:54:33.000" end="01:54:36.520" style="s2"> What I want to understand when I study Genesis</p>
<p begin="01:54:36.520" end="01:54:37.940" style="s2"> In this book</p>
<p begin="01:54:37.940" end="01:54:42.440" style="s2"> When people become conscious, they immediately understand good and evil</p>
<p begin="01:54:42.440" end="01:54:47.000" style="s2"> I can&#39;t understand, what is the connection between these?</p>
<p begin="01:54:47.000" end="01:54:50.580" style="s2"> I think this problem is about 30 years</p>
<p begin="01:54:50.580" end="01:54:54.040" style="s2"> I want to solve this mystery, and then I want to understand</p>
<p begin="01:54:55.180" end="01:54:56.860" style="s2"> When you are self-aware</p>
<p begin="01:54:58.420" end="01:55:01.220" style="s2"> You can conceptualize yourself as a creature</p>
<p begin="01:55:01.560" end="01:55:03.360" style="s2"> You know what you are</p>
<p begin="01:55:03.900" end="01:55:05.820" style="s2"> You know what you look like</p>
<p begin="01:55:05.880" end="01:55:08.760" style="s2"> Know what can hurt you and what can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:55:09.980" end="01:55:12.220" style="s2"> Soon, you know what can hurt you</p>
<p begin="01:55:13.120" end="01:55:14.920" style="s2"> You know what can hurt her</p>
<p begin="01:55:15.780" end="01:55:19.740" style="s2"> Good and evil also arise with self-consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:55:19.740" end="01:55:22.960" style="s2"> There are some characteristics that make humans fundamentally different from other species</p>
<p begin="01:55:23.240" end="01:55:25.080" style="s2"> Lions eat you</p>
<p begin="01:55:25.240" end="01:55:28.600" style="s2"> But it won&#39;t torture you slowly</p>
<p begin="01:55:28.680" end="01:55:30.040" style="s2"> Just for pleasure</p>
<p begin="01:55:30.040" end="01:55:32.700" style="s2"> It just eats you</p>
<p begin="01:55:32.700" end="01:55:35.880" style="s2"> You can think this is evil, it must be very bad</p>
<p begin="01:55:36.160" end="01:55:40.720" style="s2"> But animals are actually beyond the concept of good and evil, but humans,</p>
<p begin="01:55:40.720" end="01:55:43.260" style="s2"> We can be very evil, we are very good at it</p>
<p begin="01:55:43.260" end="01:55:48.440" style="s2"> Because we will imagine that if it hurts me, it will hurt you too</p>
<p begin="01:55:48.440" end="01:55:52.360" style="s2"> You need to know your possible behavior, because this is you</p>
<p begin="01:55:52.360" end="01:55:55.360" style="s2"> If you think you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:55:55.380" end="01:55:58.240" style="s2"> Actually you will behave similarly more than you think</p>
<p begin="01:55:58.240" end="01:56:02.880" style="s2"> Because the people who have this behavior most often are those who think they will never do it</p>
<p begin="01:56:03.600" end="01:56:05.760" style="s2"> You need to fight it</p>
<p begin="01:56:05.760" end="01:56:11.920" style="s2"> This is why in many systems conceptualizing the world is a war between good and evil</p>
<p begin="01:56:12.000" end="01:56:14.960" style="s2"> This is a reasonable conceptualization</p>
<p begin="01:56:16.280" end="01:56:18.760" style="s2"> Meta concept</p>
<p begin="01:56:18.820" end="01:56:23.380" style="s2"> Culture is a wise and authoritarian king, always like this</p>
<p begin="01:56:23.380" end="01:56:28.560" style="s2"> You are often stuck in it, because as an individual, you have both positive and negative sides</p>
<p begin="01:56:28.560" end="01:56:31.420" style="s2"> The negative side is full of resentment and is easily provoked</p>
<p begin="01:56:32.000" end="01:56:35.120" style="s2"> Is limited</p>
<p begin="01:56:35.120" end="01:56:39.300" style="s2"> Suffering is inevitable, this is the tyranny and unfair side of nature</p>
<p begin="01:56:39.320" end="01:56:43.440" style="s2"> No wonder you have a dark side</p>
<p begin="01:56:43.700" end="01:56:45.460" style="s2"> This is not a trivial matter</p>
<p begin="01:56:46.820" end="01:56:50.340" style="s2"> In the Karamazov brothers, arguing is very artistic</p>
<p begin="01:56:50.340" end="01:56:56.740" style="s2"> There is a character called Alise, he is a monk apprentice, not outstanding in talent</p>
<p begin="01:56:56.900" end="01:57:04.740" style="s2"> But he is a good man. His brother is called Ivan, who is a genius for evil</p>
<p begin="01:57:07.620" end="01:57:12.600" style="s2"> One of the ways Ivan tortured Allese was to tell a story that Dostoevsky later changed into a new story</p>
<p begin="01:57:12.840" end="01:57:16.220" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:57:16.220" end="01:57:20.760" style="s2"> This story is about a pair of parents taking their little daughter</p>
<p begin="01:57:20.760" end="01:57:22.960" style="s2"> Once locked her out all night</p>
<p begin="01:57:22.960" end="01:57:28.240" style="s2"> It was very cold outside, she stayed outside crying and screaming until she died of freezing</p>
<p begin="01:57:28.780" end="01:57:32.280" style="s2"> Ivan will basically give Alese these</p>
<p begin="01:57:35.360" end="01:57:38.480" style="s2"> Something that shouldn&#39;t have happened in reality</p>
<p begin="01:57:40.920" end="01:57:46.200" style="s2"> This is a good argument, you can even cite thousands of similar examples</p>
<p begin="01:57:48.080" end="01:57:51.680" style="s2"> Part of us is always trying to prevent us from being, full of resentment</p>
<p begin="01:57:52.860" end="01:57:54.220" style="s2"> This is a good idea</p>
<p begin="01:57:55.080" end="01:57:59.860" style="s2"> As far as I know, if you show this</p>
<p begin="01:57:59.980" end="01:58:02.940" style="s2"> It will make you worse</p>
<p begin="01:58:03.840" end="01:58:06.240" style="s2"> Maybe you should be happy about it</p>
<p begin="01:58:06.240" end="01:58:08.900" style="s2"> You might think that people don’t do such things when they are conscious</p>
<p begin="01:58:09.180" end="01:58:11.920" style="s2"> But they will</p>
<p begin="01:58:11.920" end="01:58:16.380" style="s2"> I recommend you to read Karpenzram (Perverted Murderer), if you are interested in such issues</p>
<p begin="01:58:16.780" end="01:58:21.280" style="s2"> The author of this book raped thousands of men and killed dozens</p>
<p begin="01:58:21.280" end="01:58:24.260" style="s2"> Do your best to destroy everything</p>
<p begin="01:58:24.260" end="01:58:27.080" style="s2"> Want to start a war between Britain and America</p>
<p begin="01:58:27.300" end="01:58:29.620" style="s2"> No goal except killing</p>
<p begin="01:58:29.620" end="01:58:33.140" style="s2"> He wrote an autobiography at the request of a doctor who also encountered his</p>
<p begin="01:58:33.140" end="01:58:37.540" style="s2"> He recorded in detail what he did and why he did it</p>
<p begin="01:58:45.400" end="01:58:46.120" style="s2"> this story</p>
<p begin="01:58:48.660" end="01:58:51.300" style="s2"> Heroes and opponents</p>
<p begin="01:58:52.900" end="01:58:56.620" style="s2"> Order and power, destruction and reconstruction</p>
<p begin="01:58:57.800" end="01:59:02.000" style="s2"> This is the most basic picture outside of chaos, let’s rest for a while</p>
<p begin="01:59:03.300" end="01:59:04.740" style="s2"> This is another way of looking at</p>
<p begin="01:59:05.520" end="01:59:08.740" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:59:12.680" end="01:59:17.120" style="s2"> The individual may concentrate, explore, master</p>
<p begin="01:59:17.620" end="01:59:21.480" style="s2"> Or distracted elsewhere</p>
<p begin="01:59:24.200" end="01:59:24.880" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:59:26.000" end="01:59:29.120" style="s2"> People stay in the explored field</p>
<p begin="01:59:30.380" end="01:59:32.620" style="s2"> This is the unexplored field</p>
<p begin="01:59:33.700" end="01:59:39.160" style="s2"> No matter where you go, you have two opposing halves</p>
<p begin="01:59:39.420" end="01:59:42.100" style="s2"> You have to fight for yourself</p>
<p begin="01:59:43.260" end="01:59:49.500" style="s2"> No matter where it is, as long as there is a human society, there is autocracy and beneficial nature</p>
<p begin="01:59:49.740" end="01:59:55.740" style="s2"> In a sense, society is what you are doing matches what is happening</p>
<p begin="01:59:55.740" end="02:00:00.000" style="s2"> This is very important, unexplored area</p>
<p begin="02:00:00.480" end="02:00:04.140" style="s2"> No matter when and where, your experience is invalid</p>
<p begin="02:00:04.140" end="02:00:10.580" style="s2"> This is not a geographical concept, because when you think about a known field</p>
<p begin="02:00:10.580" end="02:00:15.240" style="s2"> What you think of is the geographical realm, like an animal land, your house</p>
<p begin="02:00:15.380" end="02:00:17.140" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="02:00:21.240" end="02:00:24.600" style="s2"> This must be an element of the territory, but you know</p>
<p begin="02:00:24.600" end="02:00:29.240" style="s2"> When you are at your home, a snake sneaks into your living room, you are right there</p>
<p begin="02:00:29.240" end="02:00:34.000" style="s2"> There is a major difference between the house 1 second ago and your house now</p>
<p begin="02:00:34.400" end="02:00:41.400" style="s2"> Your house can become unknown as soon as the hat drops because you are in time and space</p>
<p begin="02:00:41.400" end="02:00:45.780" style="s2"> Unexplored areas are conceptualized</p>
<p begin="02:00:46.140" end="02:00:52.240" style="s2"> This is a conceptual field, which refers to when your experience is not available wherever you are</p>
<p begin="02:00:52.340" end="02:00:54.820" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="02:00:55.080" end="02:01:00.300" style="s2"> Human experience has its permanence</p>
<p begin="02:01:00.300" end="02:01:03.120" style="s2"> This is what I think is the basic element in our narrative</p>
<p begin="02:01:03.120" end="02:01:04.380" style="s2"> This is part of you</p>
<p begin="02:01:05.200" end="02:01:07.440" style="s2"> There are some themes of stories</p>
<p begin="02:01:07.440" end="02:01:11.100" style="s2"> The subject is a self-contradictory person with many different potentials</p>
<p begin="02:01:11.100" end="02:01:12.640" style="s2"> You are always with other people somewhere</p>
<p begin="02:01:12.640" end="02:01:16.040" style="s2"> Because this is our territory</p>
<p begin="02:01:16.040" end="02:01:18.260" style="s2"> I mean social animals</p>
<p begin="02:01:18.260" end="02:01:22.380" style="s2"> Even our ancient ancestors, many of their territories</p>
<p begin="02:01:22.820" end="02:01:30.780" style="s2"> There are other primates too, we classify the world into accumulating characteristics</p>
<p begin="02:01:30.980" end="02:01:35.620" style="s2"> This is very important to us, and it is our tendency to look at the whole world</p>
<p begin="02:01:36.120" end="02:01:39.160" style="s2"> Uncharted territory</p>
<p begin="02:01:40.080" end="02:01:43.360" style="s2"> Is where you don&#39;t know how to act</p>
<p begin="02:01:43.360" end="02:01:46.900" style="s2"> But when you don’t know what to do, you actually know what to do</p>
<p begin="02:01:46.900" end="02:01:53.560" style="s2"> This is quite normal, our pressure feedback system will behave as</p>
<p begin="02:01:54.180" end="02:01:58.180" style="s2"> Freeze, generally speaking, if the threat is big enough</p>
<p begin="02:01:58.180" end="02:02:02.320" style="s2"> You secrete a lot of cortisol and adrenaline, which can make you</p>
<p begin="02:02:02.320" end="02:02:05.740" style="s2"> Always ready to act fast</p>
<p begin="02:02:06.000" end="02:02:08.560" style="s2"> If you pay attention</p>
<p begin="02:02:08.560" end="02:02:14.540" style="s2"> This is what you do when you don’t know how to do it, the problem is that you can stay in this state forever</p>
<p begin="02:02:14.540" end="02:02:17.160" style="s2"> This is also a traumatic post-stress disorder state</p>
<p begin="02:02:17.360" end="02:02:19.600" style="s2"> You will always be in this state</p>
<p begin="02:02:19.600" end="02:02:23.120" style="s2"> The problem is that it’s very uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="02:02:23.120" end="02:02:26.420" style="s2"> When you stay in this state for a while, you will feel frustrated</p>
<p begin="02:02:26.420" end="02:02:29.480" style="s2"> Will produce disorderly anxiety and you will grow old</p>
<p begin="02:02:29.480" end="02:02:33.060" style="s2"> Because it consumes a lot of energy and energy quickly</p>
<p begin="02:02:33.400" end="02:02:36.920" style="s2"> Your body system has been delaying all problems to respond to the current state of emergency</p>

<p begin="02:02:39.880" end="02:02:41.000" style="s2"> It&#39;s very energy consuming</p>
<p begin="02:02:41.600" end="02:02:43.440" style="s2"> This is not what you want</p>
<p begin="02:02:44.140" end="02:02:47.420" style="s2"> This is one of the reasons why people tend to defend their territories</p>
<p begin="02:02:47.420" end="02:02:50.780" style="s2"> because</p>
<p begin="02:02:50.780" end="02:02:54.300" style="s2"> If their familiar territory is invaded or disturbed</p>
<p begin="02:02:54.300" end="02:02:59.240" style="s2"> They will enter a state of emergency</p>
<p begin="02:02:59.660" end="02:03:03.120" style="s2"> This will strip you away and have a profound impact</p>
<p begin="02:03:03.120" end="02:03:05.200" style="s2"> You understand this state</p>
<p begin="02:03:05.200" end="02:03:08.140" style="s2"> When people are betrayed by someone in close relationships, they usually</p>
<p begin="02:03:08.140" end="02:03:12.100" style="s2"> Will experience this feeling</p>
<p begin="02:03:12.100" end="02:03:13.780" style="s2"> Or people lie</p>
<p begin="02:03:13.860" end="02:03:15.220" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="02:03:15.220" end="02:03:18.760" style="s2"> The dream I&#39;ve been pursuing is broken</p>
<p begin="02:03:18.760" end="02:03:23.280" style="s2"> Or family members’ illness or death, etc., but betrayal is the most typical</p>
<p begin="02:03:23.280" end="02:03:27.200" style="s2"> Because you have been with someone for a long time and you trust him</p>
<p begin="02:03:27.200" end="02:03:32.120" style="s2"> In this relationship you represent your past and present</p>
<p begin="02:03:32.120" end="02:03:36.020" style="s2"> You describe this relationship</p>
<p begin="02:03:36.020" end="02:03:38.280" style="s2"> And the future related to it</p>
<p begin="02:03:38.320" end="02:03:43.440" style="s2"> You’ve been betrayed, it’s like bum, even the past is different from what you once thought</p>
<p begin="02:03:43.440" end="02:03:44.960" style="s2"> about you</p>
<p begin="02:03:46.200" end="02:03:47.980" style="s2"> You have no clue</p>
<p begin="02:03:47.980" end="02:03:52.540" style="s2"> Why is it so easy to be deceived, you don&#39;t know, is this your fault?</p>
<p begin="02:03:52.660" end="02:03:56.340" style="s2"> So stupid that I can&#39;t protect myself</p>
<p begin="02:03:56.340" end="02:04:00.440" style="s2"> Or others are so vicious that you don’t even notice</p>
<p begin="02:04:00.440" end="02:04:02.000" style="s2"> Everything is floating in the air, it&#39;s no good</p>
<p begin="02:04:02.680" end="02:04:06.760" style="s2"> There is also a concept that humans travel around the underground world</p>
<p begin="02:04:06.760" end="02:04:11.660" style="s2"> Come back again, this is a useful way to understand, because</p>
<p begin="02:04:12.080" end="02:04:13.720" style="s2"> We often do</p>
<p begin="02:04:13.720" end="02:04:17.800" style="s2"> Whenever we fail, it’s like suddenly falling into the underground world</p>
<p begin="02:04:17.820" end="02:04:19.740" style="s2"> Everything is in chaos there</p>
<p begin="02:04:19.740" end="02:04:23.080" style="s2"> Maybe we organize ourselves and come back again</p>
<p begin="02:04:23.180" end="02:04:26.540" style="s2"> So, a way to conceptualize yourself, not order</p>
<p begin="02:04:27.120" end="02:04:30.240" style="s2"> Not chaos</p>
<p begin="02:04:30.240" end="02:04:34.360" style="s2"> But in between</p>
<p begin="02:04:35.140" end="02:04:37.860" style="s2"> I think it’s a mythical hero</p>
<p begin="02:04:43.560" end="02:04:44.220" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="02:04:44.220" end="02:04:47.680" style="s2"> So I will start with Pinocchio</p>
<p begin="02:04:48.100" end="02:04:49.140" style="s2"> Quite weird</p>
<p begin="02:04:49.740" end="02:04:51.220" style="s2"> I hope you can find fun in it</p>
<p begin="02:04:53.980" end="02:04:57.660" style="s2"> Why start with Pinocchio because</p>
<p begin="02:04:59.500" end="02:05:02.220" style="s2"> Because I hope to introduce the abstract knowledge mentioned above into examples</p>
<p begin="02:05:02.680" end="02:05:03.560" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="02:05:03.560" end="02:05:05.280" style="s2"> So easy to think</p>
<p begin="02:05:05.280" end="02:05:09.360" style="s2"> To conceptualize knowledge like I said above, are they good for everything?</p>
<p begin="02:05:09.480" end="02:05:10.420" style="s2"> Do they help</p>
<p begin="02:05:11.480" end="02:05:14.520" style="s2"> This is the order in the chaos in hiding</p>
<p begin="02:05:15.540" end="02:05:19.480" style="s2"> Establishment of order</p>
<p begin="02:05:19.640" end="02:05:22.600" style="s2"> Heaven has fallen, secular history</p>
<p begin="02:05:22.700" end="02:05:25.660" style="s2"> Heaven is rebuilt, this is a classic comedy</p>
<p begin="02:05:25.780" end="02:05:27.780" style="s2"> Is also a story of life</p>
<p begin="02:05:28.560" end="02:05:29.300" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="02:05:29.320" end="02:05:31.720" style="s2"> The question is how much you can control him</p>
<p begin="02:05:32.400" end="02:05:33.080" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="02:05:33.080" end="02:05:37.400" style="s2"> Everyone wants to know the answer to this question</p>
<p begin="02:05:37.520" end="02:05:39.360" style="s2"> Very weird, you will pay</p>
<p begin="02:05:39.360" end="02:05:41.180" style="s2"> Pay online to see related stories</p>
<p begin="02:05:41.340" end="02:05:45.640" style="s2"> Even if you don’t know what these stories are really telling</p>
<p begin="02:05:45.640" end="02:05:46.600" style="s2"> The reason is</p>
<p begin="02:05:46.600" end="02:05:49.700" style="s2"> Some part of you knows what these stories are telling</p>
<p begin="02:05:49.700" end="02:05:53.300" style="s2"> Your perception is hierarchical</p>
<p begin="02:05:53.380" end="02:05:55.180" style="s2"> You understand things you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="02:05:56.220" end="02:05:58.860" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="02:05:58.860" end="02:06:02.780" style="s2"> Through many ways you don’t understand, you can feel</p>
<p begin="02:06:02.780" end="02:06:06.420" style="s2"> We mentioned a little Pinocchio story, which is ridiculous</p>
<p begin="02:06:06.420" end="02:06:09.280" style="s2"> But not important</p>
<p begin="02:06:10.420" end="02:06:16.480" style="s2"> Student - I have a question, is chaos that people do not act in a way that you expect and cause you negative emotions,</p>
<p begin="02:06:16.480" end="02:06:19.780" style="s2"> Something bad happened</p>
<p begin="02:06:19.800" end="02:06:24.880" style="s2"> What if the opponent’s actions are very positive, such as winning a big lottery</p>
<p begin="02:06:25.200" end="02:06:29.060" style="s2"> You still get into a stress response, or?</p>
<p begin="02:06:29.840" end="02:06:31.300" style="s2"> This is the same situation</p>
<p begin="02:06:31.300" end="02:06:35.360" style="s2"> No, this is not the same situation, this is a good question</p>
<p begin="02:06:35.360" end="02:06:36.360" style="s2"> Let&#39;s think about it</p>
<p begin="02:06:36.360" end="02:06:40.380" style="s2"> Usually winning the big lottery is not good for people</p>
<p begin="02:06:40.940" end="02:06:43.340" style="s2"> This amount is too much</p>
<p begin="02:06:43.380" end="02:06:44.820" style="s2"> To them</p>
<p begin="02:06:44.820" end="02:06:46.760" style="s2"> Has changed their lives drastically</p>
<p begin="02:06:47.340" end="02:06:47.960" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="02:06:47.960" end="02:06:53.000" style="s2"> The best situation is to continue living their previous emotions and life as much as possible</p>
<p begin="02:06:53.040" end="02:06:56.140" style="s2"> But this is indeed a great thing</p>
<p begin="02:06:56.140" end="02:07:00.660" style="s2"> I mean, at least better than other very bad things</p>
<p begin="02:07:00.700" end="02:07:04.260" style="s2"> But it still brings instability</p>
<p begin="02:07:04.600" end="02:07:08.600" style="s2"> It depends on what element in your life it will disrupt</p>
<p begin="02:07:09.140" end="02:07:13.500" style="s2"> It can be understood that you have a map of action in the world</p>
<p begin="02:07:13.540" end="02:07:15.480" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="02:07:15.480" end="02:07:19.340" style="s2"> This map is either superficial or profound</p>
<p begin="02:07:19.400" end="02:07:21.780" style="s2"> Different preset composition</p>
<p begin="02:07:21.980" end="02:07:25.100" style="s2"> When the profound preset is destroyed</p>
<p begin="02:07:25.100" end="02:07:27.540" style="s2"> Huge blocks in the map will be invalid</p>
<p begin="02:07:27.560" end="02:07:29.000" style="s2"> sometimes</p>
<p begin="02:07:29.060" end="02:07:33.060" style="s2"> It also occurs when particularly severe positive events occur</p>
<p begin="02:07:33.220" end="02:07:37.900" style="s2"> When the basic law, the more concepts are disturbed,</p>
<p begin="02:07:38.420" end="02:07:40.380" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="02:07:42.080" end="02:07:45.020" style="s2"> Harder to recover</p>
<p begin="02:07:45.020" end="02:07:47.500" style="s2"> When you win the big lottery, maybe you will quit your job</p>
<p begin="02:07:47.500" end="02:07:50.180" style="s2"> I want to go to the beach, I want to have a Margarita</p>
<p begin="02:07:50.180" end="02:07:52.760" style="s2"> Maybe you can be cool for a few days in this state</p>
<p begin="02:07:52.760" end="02:07:57.920" style="s2"> When you live a life of drunkenness and dreams for 3 months on the beach, it can be considered an improvement.</p>
<p begin="02:07:57.920" end="02:08:02.560" style="s2"> It’s not as easy as it seems, when you make people deviate from their daily routine</p>
<p begin="02:08:03.100" end="02:08:05.280" style="s2"> They will be confused</p>
<p begin="02:08:06.340" end="02:08:10.540" style="s2"> Their routine is broken, they don’t eat normally, and they don’t know what to do</p>
<p begin="02:08:11.200" end="02:08:12.200" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="02:08:12.880" end="02:08:16.500" style="s2"> This is why retirement is difficult for many people</p>
<p begin="02:08:16.500" end="02:08:18.360" style="s2"> I am about to retire</p>
<p begin="02:08:22.180" end="02:08:24.940" style="s2"> When I relax for two weeks, maybe I will die</p>
<p begin="02:08:24.980" end="02:08:27.200" style="s2"> I need to do something</p>
<p begin="02:08:27.200" end="02:08:29.160" style="s2"> I need to devote myself to something</p>
<p begin="02:08:29.440" end="02:08:30.240" style="s2"> Closer to home</p>
<p begin="02:08:32.140" end="02:08:36.800" style="s2"> Pinocchio, an early Disney movie, very genius</p>
<p begin="02:08:36.800" end="02:08:38.760" style="s2"> So I will lead you to interpret</p>
<p begin="02:08:38.760" end="02:08:40.660" style="s2"> And tell you what I think it means</p>
<p begin="02:08:41.080" end="02:08:42.760" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="02:08:42.760" end="02:08:45.140" style="s2"> You can also express your thoughts, which is beneficial to our understanding</p>
<p begin="02:08:45.140" end="02:08:49.400" style="s2"> Today I will only talk for 10 minutes, try to be as detailed as possible</p>
<p begin="02:08:49.420" end="02:08:54.100" style="s2"> We will continue next class</p>
<p begin="02:08:56.580" end="02:08:58.980" style="s2"> Beginning of the video</p>
<p begin="02:08:59.060" end="02:09:00.420" style="s2"> Cast list</p>
<p begin="02:09:00.420" end="02:09:04.160" style="s2"> Is carved on wood, which is a hint</p>
<p begin="02:09:04.600" end="02:09:08.200" style="s2"> Because Gaby is a carpenter, the background music is</p>
<p begin="02:09:08.200" end="02:09:10.220" style="s2"> A very popular song</p>
<p begin="02:09:10.300" end="02:09:11.680" style="s2"> a little bit</p>
<p begin="02:09:12.780" end="02:09:13.980" style="s2"> Uh, how would you describe it</p>
<p begin="02:09:15.060" end="02:09:16.580" style="s2"> I do not think so</p>
<p begin="02:09:16.580" end="02:09:18.880" style="s2"> This is a very profound poem</p>
<p begin="02:09:18.940" end="02:09:23.260" style="s2"> But this is a song that people love and listen to today</p>
<p begin="02:09:23.880" end="02:09:27.640" style="s2"> Set the tone of the movie, this is the role of music</p>
<p begin="02:09:27.640" end="02:09:31.460" style="s2"> One of the most mysterious things about the film is</p>
<p begin="02:09:32.260" end="02:09:33.020" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="02:09:33.020" end="02:09:36.100" style="s2"> When you watch a movie, there is always background music</p>
<p begin="02:09:36.720" end="02:09:39.420" style="s2"> If the movie has no background music</p>
<p begin="02:09:39.420" end="02:09:42.260" style="s2"> It feels a little hollow, like missing something</p>
<p begin="02:09:42.260" end="02:09:43.960" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="02:09:43.960" end="02:09:46.460" style="s2"> When you watch a movie, there are a lot of things you can’t see,</p>
<p begin="02:09:46.460" end="02:09:48.780" style="s2"> For example, the role is partial</p>
<p begin="02:09:48.780" end="02:09:52.680" style="s2"> You don’t understand the background, it’s like low resolution</p>
<p begin="02:09:52.680" end="02:09:56.580" style="s2"> The role of music seems to provide an emotional background to the complex context of the film</p>
<p begin="02:09:56.580" end="02:10:01.400" style="s2"> Like some kind of substitute for content</p>
<p begin="02:10:01.600" end="02:10:06.480" style="s2"> Guide you into the video settings</p>
<p begin="02:10:06.480" end="02:10:08.800" style="s2"> It gives a hint that the movie is about to happen</p>
<p begin="02:10:08.800" end="02:10:13.360" style="s2"> The most interesting thing is that we have no objections to this</p>
<p begin="02:10:13.740" end="02:10:17.660" style="s2"> Just like the movie has background music</p>
<p begin="02:10:17.660" end="02:10:21.260" style="s2"> When the plot changes drastically, the music also changes drastically</p>
<p begin="02:10:21.260" end="02:10:22.900" style="s2"> But it doesn’t happen in real life (background music)</p>
<p begin="02:10:22.900" end="02:10:25.960" style="s2"> Maybe you are wondering why we can accept music in the film</p>
<p begin="02:10:25.980" end="02:10:31.420" style="s2"> Part of the reason may be that we tend to accept exaggerated reality</p>
<p begin="02:10:31.420" end="02:10:33.080" style="s2"> This makes up the movie</p>
<p begin="02:10:33.080" end="02:10:37.820" style="s2"> In fact, we found that the ability of music to amplify dramatic effects is very significant</p>
<p begin="02:10:37.820" end="02:10:41.580" style="s2"> We can accept</p>
<p begin="02:10:42.200" end="02:10:46.380" style="s2"> This song is very interesting, so I plan to analyze it a little bit</p>
<p begin="02:10:50.300" end="02:10:55.020" style="s2"> Sometimes I feel stupid to do this, because this song is a bit childish</p>
<p begin="02:10:55.400" end="02:10:58.640" style="s2"> This is a childish song</p>
<p begin="02:10:58.640" end="02:10:59.140" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="02:11:00.100" end="02:11:05.140" style="s2"> But it’s okay, when you make a wish to the stars, it doesn’t make you any different</p>
<p begin="02:11:06.000" end="02:11:09.000" style="s2"> Yes, people wishing to the stars is a somewhat mysterious act</p>
<p begin="02:11:11.100" end="02:11:14.940" style="s2"> Some sense of ritual</p>
<p begin="02:11:17.020" end="02:11:17.820" style="s2"> why</p>
<p begin="02:11:18.840" end="02:11:19.880" style="s2"> People want to do</p>
<p begin="02:11:22.460" end="02:11:22.960" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="02:11:25.600" end="02:11:27.600" style="s2"> What exactly do the stars represent</p>
<p begin="02:11:27.780" end="02:11:30.020" style="s2"> This is another question</p>
<p begin="02:11:30.240" end="02:11:32.960" style="s2"> Because the stars shine in heaven</p>
<p begin="02:11:33.020" end="02:11:35.260" style="s2"> Some people are stars</p>

<p begin="02:11:39.060" end="02:11:40.540" style="s2"> Why do people make stars to chase stars</p>
<p begin="02:11:40.920" end="02:11:44.100" style="s2"> Stars are usually very famous people,</p>
<p begin="02:11:44.380" end="02:11:46.380" style="s2"> They attract a lot of attention</p>
<p begin="02:11:46.380" end="02:11:49.680" style="s2"> Maybe these people are very talented,</p>
<p begin="02:11:50.100" end="02:11:57.100" style="s2"> Maybe they are idols, not just supermodels, they are imitated</p>
<p begin="02:11:57.100" end="02:12:01.000" style="s2"> This is what it means to be a star, and why the magazine is full of stars</p>
<p begin="02:12:01.220" end="02:12:05.100" style="s2"> Like they are heroes brought to the world</p>
<p begin="02:12:05.100" end="02:12:09.100" style="s2"> Of course you don’t know anything about them, only the public image</p>
<p begin="02:12:09.100" end="02:12:12.120" style="s2"> Of course they are usually charming</p>
<p begin="02:12:12.440" end="02:12:18.040" style="s2"> People will project the perfect personality on them</p>
<p begin="02:12:19.040" end="02:12:20.400" style="s2"> They are stars</p>
<p begin="02:12:21.440" end="02:12:25.860" style="s2"> But why make stars to chase stars? Stars can be summoned in the dark, right</p>
<p begin="02:12:26.080" end="02:12:27.840" style="s2"> They are from another world</p>
<p begin="02:12:27.860" end="02:12:31.540" style="s2"> They don’t belong to the earth, this is a cool place</p>
<p begin="02:12:31.800" end="02:12:33.040" style="s2"> Technically</p>
<p begin="02:12:33.040" end="02:12:37.880" style="s2"> The stars obviously do not belong to the earth,</p>
<p begin="02:12:37.920" end="02:12:38.760" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="02:12:38.760" end="02:12:42.960" style="s2"> And in terms of phenomena, it is like an element of human experience</p>
<p begin="02:12:43.840" end="02:12:45.200" style="s2"> Many of you are from the city</p>
<p begin="02:12:46.260" end="02:12:49.320" style="s2"> There is not much experience and opportunity to see the night sky full of stars</p>
<p begin="02:12:49.320" end="02:12:53.700" style="s2"> This is a pity because</p>
<p begin="02:12:54.080" end="02:12:58.880" style="s2"> The starry night sky is awe-inspiring</p>
<p begin="02:12:59.160" end="02:13:01.480" style="s2"> Naturally you will feel this</p>
<p begin="02:13:01.480" end="02:13:04.560" style="s2"> When you look up, the stars are all over the night sky</p>
<p begin="02:13:04.560" end="02:13:07.440" style="s2"> You are looking at the edge of the Milky Way, the milky white band</p>
<p begin="02:13:07.440" end="02:13:10.740" style="s2"> You will be amazed</p>
<p begin="02:13:11.000" end="02:13:13.320" style="s2"> This is the edge of the Milky Way</p>
<p begin="02:13:13.320" end="02:13:18.400" style="s2"> There are countless stars, very vast, like looking towards infinity</p>
<p begin="02:13:18.400" end="02:13:22.260" style="s2"> Look into the unknown, look beyond you</p>
<p begin="02:13:22.300" end="02:13:23.340" style="s2"> Definitely</p>
<p begin="02:13:23.340" end="02:13:28.920" style="s2"> This makes people feel awe, like seeing a huge canyon or similar picture</p>
<p begin="02:13:28.920" end="02:13:34.660" style="s2"> You are looking at something beyond yourself, this sense of awe</p>
<p begin="02:13:35.300" end="02:13:38.740" style="s2"> Is a natural part of our feedback system</p>
<p begin="02:13:38.740" end="02:13:44.320" style="s2"> Maybe you will feel awe when you meet someone you respect and desire</p>
<p begin="02:13:44.320" end="02:13:46.740" style="s2"> Because you think they have something extraordinary</p>
<p begin="02:13:46.740" end="02:13:49.060" style="s2"> Have a very interesting idea</p>
<p begin="02:13:51.020" end="02:13:52.860" style="s2"> There are people you admire and don&#39;t admire</p>
<p begin="02:13:53.160" end="02:13:55.640" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="02:13:55.640" end="02:13:59.220" style="s2"> This is a clue to your value system</p>
<p begin="02:13:59.220" end="02:14:05.240" style="s2"> Maybe you can’t tell why you find some people attractive</p>
<p begin="02:14:05.280" end="02:14:06.520" style="s2"> Admirable</p>
<p begin="02:14:06.520" end="02:14:10.620" style="s2"> It’s like you’re looking for something that you can admire</p>
<p begin="02:14:10.620" end="02:14:12.280" style="s2"> Hypothesis</p>
<p begin="02:14:12.400" end="02:14:16.720" style="s2"> The person you admire has a certain ability</p>
<p begin="02:14:16.720" end="02:14:18.920" style="s2"> You also want to have</p>
<p begin="02:14:18.920" end="02:14:21.180" style="s2"> So they became idols to be imitated</p>
<p begin="02:14:21.180" end="02:14:26.060" style="s2"> This is part of the reason why people develop, just like some children often treat older children as heroes</p>
<p begin="02:14:26.080" end="02:14:28.160" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="02:14:28.160" end="02:14:32.800" style="s2"> Not much older than them, usually within their understanding</p>
<p begin="02:14:32.800" end="02:14:34.980" style="s2"> They will follow such children and imitate them</p>
<p begin="02:14:35.220" end="02:14:38.880" style="s2"> They imitate people they admire</p>
<p begin="02:14:38.880" end="02:14:45.400" style="s2"> The fact that you admire certain people or things provides clues to understanding your unrealized value system</p>
<p begin="02:14:45.860" end="02:14:50.260" style="s2"> Even as an exercise</p>
<p begin="02:14:50.260" end="02:14:55.240" style="s2"> What kind of human qualities I admire, you need to ask yourself</p>
<p begin="02:14:55.240" end="02:15:01.420" style="s2"> You haven’t really considered this, there is a clear difference between asking yourself questions and thinking about them</p>
<p begin="02:15:01.420" end="02:15:06.540" style="s2"> Because when you ask yourself a question, you think</p>
<p begin="02:15:06.860" end="02:15:08.940" style="s2"> What do I find about admiration?</p>
<p begin="02:15:09.080" end="02:15:11.420" style="s2"> You don&#39;t know the problem</p>
<p begin="02:15:11.420" end="02:15:17.720" style="s2"> If you are lucky, this will happen regularly, and the answers may often be wild</p>
<p begin="02:15:17.720" end="02:15:20.320" style="s2"> You can write it down</p>
<p begin="02:15:20.320" end="02:15:25.100" style="s2"> You have some ideas about what your ideals, you know, and maybe you already have a</p>
<p begin="02:15:25.580" end="02:15:27.660" style="s2"> Your ideal match is a star</p>
<p begin="02:15:31.100" end="02:15:31.940" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="02:15:31.940" end="02:15:35.680" style="s2"> When you make a wish to the starry sky, you look up at the starry sky</p>
<p begin="02:15:35.740" end="02:15:39.580" style="s2"> The spirit gathers on something beyond yourself</p>
<p begin="02:15:39.580" end="02:15:44.280" style="s2"> Focus on the starry sky shining in the dark night</p>
<p begin="02:15:44.680" end="02:15:45.740" style="s2"> Now the stars mean</p>
<p begin="02:15:46.180" end="02:15:49.540" style="s2"> People who wear jewelry, because jewelry is like stars</p>
<p begin="02:15:49.540" end="02:15:50.860" style="s2"> Or like the sun</p>
<p begin="02:15:50.860" end="02:15:54.700" style="s2"> Pure and perfect and shining,</p>
<p begin="02:15:54.700" end="02:15:57.280" style="s2"> So some matter about the source of light</p>
<p begin="02:15:57.280" end="02:15:59.540" style="s2"> This is the source of enlightenment and illumination</p>
<p begin="02:15:59.540" end="02:16:04.340" style="s2"> So the light shining in the night sky is a very deep metaphor</p>
<p begin="02:16:04.340" end="02:16:08.040" style="s2"> This is what you want, you want light to shine in the dark night</p>
<p begin="02:16:08.040" end="02:16:11.900" style="s2"> The stars have all these characteristics, so people make wishes for the stars</p>
<p begin="02:16:12.420" end="02:16:17.060" style="s2"> Because they have some intuition that can surpass the ordinary</p>
<p begin="02:16:17.460" end="02:16:21.860" style="s2"> Has the potential to reshape, they make a wish</p>
<p begin="02:16:23.120" end="02:16:24.320" style="s2"> When you want to make a wish</p>
<p begin="02:16:25.220" end="02:16:28.580" style="s2"> You should set high goals!</p>
<p begin="02:16:28.580" end="02:16:33.820" style="s2"> Even just like wishing a wish come true</p>
<p begin="02:16:34.820" end="02:16:35.640" style="s2"> This is not a metaphor</p>
<p begin="02:16:35.640" end="02:16:39.140" style="s2"> You know that I have a plan, you all will color jade</p>
<p begin="02:16:39.140" end="02:16:41.440" style="s2"> Called the future writing plan</p>
<p begin="02:16:41.440" end="02:16:44.840" style="s2"> This is one of two assignments, one of which is writing an autobiography</p>
<p begin="02:16:44.840" end="02:16:47.400" style="s2"> This is writing about the past, the other is writing about planning for the future</p>
<p begin="02:16:47.400" end="02:16:50.920" style="s2"> Called Future Writing, I suggest you start preparing immediately</p>
<p begin="02:16:50.920" end="02:16:57.120" style="s2"> Not right away, but start very quickly, because it’s harder than you think</p>
<p begin="02:16:57.360" end="02:17:00.720" style="s2"> Some of you will write about 15,000 words</p>
<p begin="02:17:00.720" end="02:17:05.380" style="s2"> You will find yourself writing poorly, this always happens</p>
<p begin="02:17:05.880" end="02:17:06.540" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="02:17:06.540" end="02:17:10.060" style="s2"> So you write an autobiography to find out where you are from</p>
<p begin="02:17:10.060" end="02:17:15.960" style="s2"> Who are you or how do you plan for the future unless you know where you are from</p>
<p begin="02:17:15.960" end="02:17:18.720" style="s2"> Then you have to write the future by hand because</p>
<p begin="02:17:18.720" end="02:17:20.840" style="s2"> When you don&#39;t have a goal, you don&#39;t have focus</p>
<p begin="02:17:22.440" end="02:17:23.480" style="s2"> Definitely</p>
<p begin="02:17:23.480" end="02:17:27.580" style="s2"> Most of the time people don’t focus on the goal because they are afraid</p>
<p begin="02:17:27.580" end="02:17:33.020" style="s2"> The reason for fear is that when you know what to do, you also know the conditions for failure</p>
<p begin="02:17:33.280" end="02:17:34.720" style="s2"> You know when you fail</p>
<p begin="02:17:34.720" end="02:17:39.580" style="s2"> It’s better to continue to feel fuzzy, like I don’t know if I succeeded or failed</p>
<p begin="02:17:39.580" end="02:17:45.380" style="s2"> This is difficult to describe in detail. well! Except when you don’t focus on the target you can’t get</p>
<p begin="02:17:45.580" end="02:17:49.020" style="s2"> So the future writing plan is like</p>
<p begin="02:17:49.020" end="02:17:52.460" style="s2"> Make you have to clearly try to describe yourself</p>
<p begin="02:17:52.620" end="02:17:56.400" style="s2"> So who are you in the past writing plan?</p>
<p begin="02:17:56.620" end="02:18:01.420" style="s2"> Past writing plans required breaking down your life into multiple periods</p>
<p begin="02:18:01.420" end="02:18:07.060" style="s2"> Write down things about emotions, that is, some important events</p>
<p begin="02:18:08.020" end="02:18:11.380" style="s2"> These events shape who you are</p>
<p begin="02:18:11.380" end="02:18:16.340" style="s2"> You will find that writing like this will make you emotional</p>
<p begin="02:18:16.340" end="02:18:19.540" style="s2"> If you have more than 18 months of memory, generally speaking</p>
<p begin="02:18:19.580" end="02:18:23.260" style="s2"> When you remember it again, there will be an emotional shock</p>
<p begin="02:18:23.260" end="02:18:25.380" style="s2"> Especially negative emotional shock</p>
<p begin="02:18:25.440" end="02:18:28.700" style="s2"> Just like part of your soul goes back and gets stuck there</p>
<p begin="02:18:28.700" end="02:18:33.360" style="s2"> This is a figurative way of thinking, I mean</p>
<p begin="02:18:35.040" end="02:18:42.040" style="s2"> Now you can still feel emotional because you still have not solved the problem in this situation</p>
<p begin="02:18:42.040" end="02:18:47.000" style="s2"> Face it, maybe this is the crux that some people still struggle with when you face it</p>
<p begin="02:18:47.000" end="02:18:51.240" style="s2"> These people are bad, it’s very difficult, because you have to deal with the problem of evil</p>
<p begin="02:18:51.240" end="02:18:53.500" style="s2"> Similar questions, this is no joke</p>
<p begin="02:18:53.500" end="02:18:58.620" style="s2"> If this still generates emotions, you have not solved the problem</p>
<p begin="02:18:58.620" end="02:19:04.560" style="s2"> Your brain still sees it as a threat, this is an area you have not mastered</p>
<p begin="02:19:04.560" end="02:19:06.720" style="s2"> Threat, threat, threat</p>
<p begin="02:19:06.720" end="02:19:11.760" style="s2"> Knowing you knock it down, expression is a useful way, writing is a useful way</p>
<p begin="02:19:12.100" end="02:19:15.700" style="s2"> The place where you are threatened will not let you free</p>
<p begin="02:19:15.700" end="02:19:20.920" style="s2"> It feels unpleasant, when you deal with these situations</p>
<p begin="02:19:21.160" end="02:19:24.120" style="s2"> In the short term will tend to produce emotional decline</p>
<p begin="02:19:24.120" end="02:19:29.040" style="s2"> But it was back to normal after about 3-6 months</p>
<p begin="02:19:29.040" end="02:19:35.000" style="s2"> Unfortunately, people often face this situation and must not do what they don’t want to do</p>
<p begin="02:19:35.060" end="02:19:37.280" style="s2"> This is very common</p>
<p begin="02:19:37.280" end="02:19:42.460" style="s2"> So the future writing plan asks you to thank you for the different dimensions of your life</p>
<p begin="02:19:42.700" end="02:19:48.140" style="s2"> Because you can see yourself as the personality in your head</p>
<p begin="02:19:48.280" end="02:19:54.680" style="s2"> You are embedded in a system that transcends you, as real as any thought that appears in your mind</p>
<p begin="02:19:54.840" end="02:19:58.080" style="s2"> What you need in your life</p>
<p begin="02:19:58.220" end="02:20:02.220" style="s2"> This is easy to answer, some friends</p>
<p begin="02:20:02.220" end="02:20:06.180" style="s2"> Intimacy, family, are good things</p>
<p begin="02:20:06.180" end="02:20:12.500" style="s2"> No matter what will happen or what you already have,</p>
<p begin="02:20:12.500" end="02:20:16.860" style="s2"> To some extent, from these things, people feel love and care for each other, which is also a good thing</p>
<p begin="02:20:16.860" end="02:20:23.240" style="s2"> You need a career plan, you need to find a position to make others value it and treat you equally</p>
<p begin="02:20:23.240" end="02:20:26.600" style="s2"> You can live</p>
<p begin="02:20:26.600" end="02:20:30.560" style="s2"> When you are not at work, you need to use the time to do something worthwhile</p>
<p begin="02:20:30.560" end="02:20:34.420" style="s2"> You also need to pay attention to your physical and mental health</p>
<p begin="02:20:34.680" end="02:20:37.800" style="s2"> Need to adjust and plan your asset use</p>
<p begin="02:20:37.800" end="02:20:43.760" style="s2"> This is one of the weird points, because a lot of people drink, so it’s worth thinking about, and that’s why we put it forward</p>
<p begin="02:20:43.760" end="02:20:45.840" style="s2"> The next question, what do you want?</p>
<p begin="02:20:45.940" end="02:20:48.020" style="s2"> What do you want from your friends</p>
<p begin="02:20:48.020" end="02:20:49.360" style="s2"> What to get from your family</p>
<p begin="02:20:49.360" end="02:20:51.080" style="s2"> What you get from your career</p>
<p begin="02:20:51.080" end="02:20:53.560" style="s2"> If you can get what you want, this is the question this plan asks you</p>
<p begin="02:20:53.820" end="02:20:57.340" style="s2"> After about 3-5 years of planned life, you can get what you want</p>
<p begin="02:20:57.340" end="02:21:01.000" style="s2"> I assume that your goals or expectations are like a sane adult</p>
<p begin="02:21:01.440" end="02:21:08.440" style="s2"> Instead of being like a 13-year-old dreamer, I want the most expensive yacht in the world</p>
<p begin="02:21:09.360" end="02:21:11.640" style="s2"> This is OK, but,</p>
<p begin="02:21:11.640" end="02:21:16.820" style="s2"> This does not focus on the original intention of the writing plan, allowing you to focus more on your character</p>
<p begin="02:21:17.760" end="02:21:23.700" style="s2"> Then you are asked to write for 15 minutes, almost without thinking, without considering issues such as grammar or sentence structure</p>
<p begin="02:21:24.300" end="02:21:26.700" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="02:21:26.700" end="02:21:30.540" style="s2"> About your life in the next 3-5 years</p>
<p begin="02:21:30.540" end="02:21:34.160" style="s2"> If you care about yourself</p>
<p begin="02:21:34.160" end="02:21:37.120" style="s2"> You will help (future self) imagine what he needs</p>
<p begin="02:21:37.400" end="02:21:40.760" style="s2"> Then the plan requires you to do the same thing in the opposite way</p>
<p begin="02:21:41.060" end="02:21:43.540" style="s2"> After rational consideration of various situations</p>
<p begin="02:21:43.960" end="02:21:48.720" style="s2"> Your shortcomings</p>
<p begin="02:21:49.040" end="02:21:52.480" style="s2"> I guess everyone knows</p>
<p begin="02:21:52.740" end="02:21:54.500" style="s2"> But everyone has the intuition to reduce their shortcomings</p>
<p begin="02:21:54.500" end="02:21:57.580" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="02:21:57.580" end="02:22:01.200" style="s2"> Some people are addicted to alcohol, some are on the streets</p>
<p begin="02:22:01.200" end="02:22:03.600" style="s2"> Certainly something fatal happened to produce this result</p>
<p begin="02:22:03.660" end="02:22:07.500" style="s2"> If you are particularly careless</p>
<p begin="02:22:07.660" end="02:22:09.100" style="s2"> Don&#39;t let things fall apart and fall apart</p>
<p begin="02:22:10.620" end="02:22:14.460" style="s2"> So hope you write it down</p>
<p begin="02:22:14.680" end="02:22:17.800" style="s2"> About what you don’t want to happen in the next 3-5 years</p>
<p begin="02:22:18.160" end="02:22:21.040" style="s2"> This has a psychological basis</p>
<p begin="02:22:21.040" end="02:22:25.200" style="s2"> If you have goals, this is the source of positive emotions</p>
<p begin="02:22:25.200" end="02:22:31.160" style="s2"> Because there is evidence that positive emotions usually come from when you are close to something that makes you valuable</p>
<p begin="02:22:31.160" end="02:22:34.260" style="s2"> Only completing certain plans cannot generate excessive positive emotions</p>
<p begin="02:22:34.260" end="02:22:38.080" style="s2"> Because when you finish something, you leave the problem that you will face next time</p>
<p begin="02:22:38.080" end="02:22:40.520" style="s2"> When you graduate from university</p>
<p begin="02:22:40.680" end="02:22:42.080" style="s2"> Yay!</p>
<p begin="02:22:42.160" end="02:22:47.200" style="s2"> You cannot graduate from university one day,</p>
<p begin="02:22:47.420" end="02:22:51.400" style="s2"> Then you will be unemployed, looking for a bad job like Starbucks</p>
<p begin="02:22:51.780" end="02:22:52.900" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="02:22:53.020" end="02:22:55.900" style="s2"> You understand what i mean</p>
<p begin="02:22:55.900" end="02:22:59.260" style="s2"> The problems you need to solve one after another</p>
<p begin="02:22:59.260" end="02:23:02.900" style="s2"> If you keep thinking that you will be happy when all the problems are solved</p>
<p begin="02:23:02.940" end="02:23:05.560" style="s2"> Hahaha! good luck</p>
<p begin="02:23:05.800" end="02:23:06.800" style="s2"> but</p>
<p begin="02:23:06.800" end="02:23:10.640" style="s2"> When you work towards something worthwhile, you believe it is worth it</p>
<p begin="02:23:10.640" end="02:23:16.780" style="s2"> You thought about it, you know, so you won’t be weak, because you cheer yourself up</p>
<p begin="02:23:16.780" end="02:23:21.100" style="s2"> Then when some progress is made, even if only a little bit, you think, hey, not bad,</p>
<p begin="02:23:21.140" end="02:23:22.940" style="s2"> You will release a small dose of dopamine</p>
<p begin="02:23:22.940" end="02:23:26.020" style="s2"> This makes what you want, this is the source of your positive emotions</p>
<p begin="02:23:26.020" end="02:23:27.840" style="s2"> Cocaine can also achieve this effect, but</p>
<p begin="02:23:28.580" end="02:23:32.260" style="s2"> This is bad for you in the long run</p>
<p begin="02:23:32.260" end="02:23:35.220" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="02:23:35.220" end="02:23:38.460" style="s2"> But confirm that the same system is activated, so you must have goals</p>
<p begin="02:23:38.460" end="02:23:40.340" style="s2"> You should set realistic goals</p>
<p begin="02:23:40.700" end="02:23:41.780" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="02:23:42.360" end="02:23:43.240" style="s2"> you want</p>
<p begin="02:23:43.580" end="02:23:46.540" style="s2"> And you can get it, maybe not so easy</p>
<p begin="02:23:46.540" end="02:23:49.740" style="s2"> If it’s simple, in a sense you already have it</p>
<p begin="02:23:49.740" end="02:23:53.400" style="s2"> This goal must push you forward, which is actually very fun</p>
<p begin="02:23:53.400" end="02:23:57.240" style="s2"> When you pursue an important goal, you want to do two things</p>
<p begin="02:23:57.240" end="02:23:59.460" style="s2"> One of them is to get this important thing</p>
<p begin="02:23:59.620" end="02:24:03.860" style="s2"> The other thing is that you become better in the pursuit</p>
<p begin="02:24:04.060" end="02:24:05.140" style="s2"> Yes</p>
<p begin="02:24:05.140" end="02:24:07.900" style="s2"> You can get both things at the same time</p>
<p begin="02:24:07.900" end="02:24:11.040" style="s2"> You have goals and at the same time increase your satisfaction with yourself</p>
<p begin="02:24:11.040" end="02:24:13.600" style="s2"> This is a very good deal</p>
<p begin="02:24:13.600" end="02:24:18.600" style="s2"> There are a lot of essential meanings in it, so the second plan</p>
<p begin="02:24:19.420" end="02:24:20.020" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="02:24:21.100" end="02:24:22.380" style="s2"> You write down your plan</p>
<p begin="02:24:22.380" end="02:24:25.580" style="s2"> On how to reach the goal and if not derail</p>
<p begin="02:24:25.580" end="02:24:28.220" style="s2"> You will also write down why this is good for you</p>
<p begin="02:24:28.220" end="02:24:29.920" style="s2"> Why is it good for your family</p>
<p begin="02:24:29.920" end="02:24:32.380" style="s2"> What might be beneficial to the community</p>
<p begin="02:24:32.380" end="02:24:35.840" style="s2"> Because you want to fix this</p>
<p begin="02:24:35.840" end="02:24:39.700" style="s2"> You have to think about the difficulties you may encounter and possible ways to overcome them in advance</p>
<p begin="02:24:39.700" end="02:24:42.720" style="s2"> And how to stay on track, all these</p>
<p begin="02:24:42.720" end="02:24:47.520" style="s2"> Because we have done a lot of research on this plan</p>
<p begin="02:24:47.680" end="02:24:48.180" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="02:24:48.940" end="02:24:53.420" style="s2"> When college students participate, they have a better start than those who don’t.</p>
<p begin="02:24:53.480" end="02:24:55.480" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="02:24:55.480" end="02:24:57.880" style="s2"> When college students participate in the program, about 25% will not withdraw</p>
<p begin="02:24:58.460" end="02:25:01.920" style="s2"> This number is pretty good</p>
<p begin="02:25:01.920" end="02:25:05.280" style="s2"> Their average academic performance has increased by about 20%</p>
<p begin="02:25:05.960" end="02:25:06.460" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="02:25:06.460" end="02:25:11.980" style="s2"> Not bad because you never know what obstacles you will encounter when you work</p>
<p begin="02:25:11.980" end="02:25:14.320" style="s2"> There are positive feelings, but not from my laboratory</p>
<p begin="02:25:14.320" end="02:25:17.680" style="s2"> Doing these things is good for your health</p>
<p begin="02:25:17.680" end="02:25:21.500" style="s2"> I think the reason may be when you look back on your autobiography</p>
<p begin="02:25:21.500" end="02:25:25.680" style="s2"> The negative emotions that have been following you can be washed away</p>
<p begin="02:25:25.720" end="02:25:28.040" style="s2"> Reduces your overall stress</p>
<p begin="02:25:28.040" end="02:25:33.280" style="s2"> Your brain calculates how dangerous the world is based on the ratio of success and failure in your life so far</p>
<p begin="02:25:33.500" end="02:25:36.020" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="02:25:36.020" end="02:25:40.680" style="s2"> Mechanism like this</p>
<p begin="02:25:40.680" end="02:25:44.000" style="s2"> Just like there are still holes on your map, you will fall into it</p>
<p begin="02:25:44.000" end="02:25:48.680" style="s2"> Your brain will still see it as a dangerous area</p>
<p begin="02:25:48.680" end="02:25:53.160" style="s2"> You prepare more for emergency actions, which is difficult</p>
<p begin="02:25:53.460" end="02:25:56.100" style="s2"> You want to go back in time and fix these experiences</p>
<p begin="02:25:57.400" end="02:25:59.960" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="02:25:59.960" end="02:26:00.460" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="02:26:01.760" end="02:26:04.020" style="s2"> These will simultaneously change the current ratio</p>
<p begin="02:26:04.240" end="02:26:07.360" style="s2"> It’s complicated, but that’s what you do</p>
<p begin="02:26:07.600" end="02:26:10.240" style="s2"> Write down what you have to write</p>
<p begin="02:26:11.020" end="02:26:12.540" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="02:26:13.000" end="02:26:15.960" style="s2"> Everything that makes you uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="02:26:15.960" end="02:26:17.960" style="s2"> Share with others</p>
<p begin="02:26:17.960" end="02:26:21.000" style="s2"> There are several reasons for doing this</p>
<p begin="02:26:21.000" end="02:26:23.440" style="s2"> One of them is that there is no other way</p>
<p begin="02:26:23.440" end="02:26:24.000" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="02:26:25.000" end="02:26:26.760" style="s2"> If i wanna do it with you</p>
<p begin="02:26:27.020" end="02:26:29.860" style="s2"> The grading load will be very high</p>
<p begin="02:26:29.860" end="02:26:36.820" style="s2"> But I think it is still worth doing, because this class is about narration and self-narration, so it should be done</p>
<p begin="02:26:36.820" end="02:26:39.740" style="s2"> Many of you will graduate soon</p>
<p begin="02:26:39.740" end="02:26:43.480" style="s2"> This is also helpful, it should be very helpful, this is from the student report</p>
<p begin="02:26:44.240" end="02:26:44.740" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="02:26:45.560" end="02:26:46.680" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="02:26:48.800" end="02:26:51.120" style="s2"> 3 people will rate your homework and score, and then take the average of the two with the highest score</p>
<p begin="02:26:53.120" end="02:26:58.400" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="02:26:58.400" end="02:27:01.640" style="s2"> This will give you constructive feedback</p>
<p begin="02:27:01.640" end="02:27:05.660" style="s2"> Constructive feedback tends to support what you are doing right</p>
<p begin="02:27:05.660" end="02:27:09.200" style="s2"> Maybe some tips are about which piece you can enrich</p>
<p begin="02:27:09.540" end="02:27:12.740" style="s2"> That&#39;s it, you need to write a paper</p>
<p begin="02:27:13.200" end="02:27:16.140" style="s2"> The details are explained on the website</p>
<p begin="02:27:17.520" end="02:27:23.360" style="s2"> This is the website, click on this website, the class is on the left</p>
<p begin="02:27:23.360" end="02:27:29.220" style="s2"> Click on the class and you will see a bunch of tabs, one of which is Spirit 434, which is obviously this class</p>
<p begin="02:27:29.780" end="02:27:32.260" style="s2"> The extracurricular reading content is also listed here</p>
<p begin="02:27:32.260" end="02:27:35.700" style="s2"> And how do you pass this course</p>
<p begin="02:27:35.700" end="02:27:40.280" style="s2"> The date is not accurate, I have updated it but not yet finished</p>
<p begin="02:27:40.280" end="02:27:42.620" style="s2"> But everything else can be used</p>
<p begin="02:27:42.620" end="02:27:48.160" style="s2"> This writing plan is an online plan, it will know how you do it</p>
<p begin="02:27:48.680" end="02:27:51.320" style="s2"> But I sincerely suggest that you start this week</p>
<p begin="02:27:51.700" end="02:27:52.660" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="02:27:53.040" end="02:27:53.640" style="s2"> because</p>
<p begin="02:27:53.640" end="02:27:57.240" style="s2"> When you spend more time, the result will be better</p>
<p begin="02:27:57.240" end="02:27:59.340" style="s2"> Like a writing explosion</p>
<p begin="02:27:59.340" end="02:28:04.420" style="s2"> During the intermission period, it is your brain’s way to consolidate new knowledge</p>
<p begin="02:28:05.060" end="02:28:07.940" style="s2"> Think carefully to do this</p>
<p begin="02:28:09.000" end="02:28:10.880" style="s2"> Ask yourself</p>
<p begin="02:28:11.320" end="02:28:13.800" style="s2"> This is a different way</p>
<p begin="02:28:13.800" end="02:28:18.160" style="s2"> It’s fun when you ask yourself questions, because part of you will answer</p>
<p begin="02:28:18.160" end="02:28:20.200" style="s2"> And you don&#39;t know what the answer will be</p>
<p begin="02:28:20.200" end="02:28:22.760" style="s2"> But the answer will always appear</p>
<p begin="02:28:22.760" end="02:28:28.540" style="s2"> When I was about 6 years old I would ask myself questions, which is very important</p>
<p begin="02:28:29.160" end="02:28:29.660" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="02:28:30.540" end="02:28:35.020" style="s2"> Through some mysterious steps, memories will come to mind</p>
<p begin="02:28:35.620" end="02:28:36.200" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="02:28:37.100" end="02:28:38.060" style="s2"> Course has exam</p>
<p begin="02:28:38.620" end="02:28:39.980" style="s2"> So there are two assignments plus a paper</p>
<p begin="02:28:40.760" end="02:28:42.600" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="02:28:43.480" end="02:28:44.120" style="s2"> The thesis can be</p>
<p begin="02:28:44.520" end="02:28:46.280" style="s2"> Any questions you want to discuss related to the course</p>
<p begin="02:28:47.060" end="02:28:48.900" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="02:28:48.900" end="02:28:51.720" style="s2"> Must be related to the course</p>
<p begin="02:28:52.340" end="02:28:52.840" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="02:28:52.980" end="02:28:54.340" style="s2"> This is what you wrote</p>
<p begin="02:28:56.640" end="02:29:00.000" style="s2"> Some chance to write something</p>
<p begin="02:29:02.600" end="02:29:06.000" style="s2"> Finally there is an exam, the final exam</p>
<p begin="02:29:06.000" end="02:29:10.040" style="s2"> If you read the book and come in every class, there is no problem passing the exam</p>
<p begin="02:29:11.100" end="02:29:12.860" style="s2"> Because the exam is not complicated</p>
<p begin="02:29:13.980" end="02:29:16.380" style="s2"> Just a questionnaire of what you experienced</p>
<p begin="02:29:16.960" end="02:29:20.480" style="s2"> I did not do it at the beginning of the course</p>
<p begin="02:29:20.480" end="02:29:24.120" style="s2"> Because you need carrots and sticks because you are busy</p>
<p begin="02:29:24.120" end="02:29:25.840" style="s2"> You will also classify</p>
<p begin="02:29:25.840" end="02:29:30.520" style="s2"> Do key things, maybe some people can’t grasp the point, there will be such a result</p>
<p begin="02:29:30.520" end="02:29:33.760" style="s2"> I take this as the key or you won’t read it</p>
<p begin="02:29:33.760" end="02:29:36.100" style="s2"> Part of the reason is because it is difficult</p>
<p begin="02:29:36.320" end="02:29:42.340" style="s2"> Because the lecture notes can help you pass</p>
<p begin="02:29:44.980" end="02:29:46.420" style="s2"> This is about the course</p>
<p begin="02:29:47.080" end="02:29:53.320" style="s2"> Then we tell you some stories and try to explain its meaning</p>
<p begin="02:29:53.540" end="02:29:55.780" style="s2"> What i hope happens is</p>
<p begin="02:29:56.040" end="02:30:01.080" style="s2"> The narrative world opens the door to you</p>
<p begin="02:30:01.080" end="02:30:05.340" style="s2"> This is useful,</p>
<p begin="02:30:05.860" end="02:30:06.820" style="s2"> Got it</p>
<p begin="02:30:07.280" end="02:30:09.760" style="s2"> These questions will make you adapt better</p>
<p begin="02:30:09.760" end="02:30:13.940" style="s2"> Can also help you, usually people tell me about this course</p>
<p begin="02:30:18.540" end="02:30:19.900" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="02:30:20.800" end="02:30:24.220" style="s2"> Like telling something you already know</p>
