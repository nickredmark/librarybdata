I want to tell you first
 The correct expression about the origin of this theory (I think)

 Back in the early 1980s,
 I was about the same age as you now


 There was a trend of thought that existed, especially around 1984
 Every generation has its own worries about reality or imagined reality

 Our generation
 The main concern is nuclear war
 (You know) it started at a certain point and lasted for many years
 Real worries
 I used to go to Arizona
 Visit the intercontinental ballistic missile, a decommissioned
 Intercontinental nuclear missile
 And the missile silo, which is very large, and the rocket is from
 Launched here
 They can fly half a circle around the earth
 It’s very deep underground, in a very thick iron gate
 Is a soft pale green
 Like the color that people liked in the 50s
 It's like a light green Star Trek console

 what
 So we get down to
 Fangting, located in the desert, outside the Fangting
 how to say
 There is a magical object
 I don't have a better word to describe
 Is the front cone of the missile,

 Very big
 Very high, the top is like the top of a bullet
 About three-quarters of an inch thick,
 A bit like resin plastic.
 This design is to protect the missile from melting when returning.
 It stands there
 It is inevitable that it is thought-provoking,
 See here for the time being
 Then we went again
 Missile silos,
 Interestingly
 Since the Reagan era was retired, the front of the missile well
 Became a museum,

 The collection includes handicrafts from the 1980s,
 Reagan and Barbachev met several times during this period.
 The staff working in the museum are from the southern United States,

 They are probably the age of (your) grandparents
 Very friendly
 And they love it here,
 (This feeling) is like visiting grandmother’s nuclear silo
 So there is a sense of conflict, you know this place
 It used to be unknown, but now it is connected with hospitality
 Very surreal in this dimension
 Anyway, we entered
 Inside the silo
 They performed a mock launch for us
 Let's imagine
 A metal panel that is twice as long as this, and another thing like this 16 feet away
 Use upgraded 50s technology
 Imagine what you have to do to launch it
 There are two people each with a key hanging around their necks
 Although I don’t think the key will be kept on their neck forever
 In order to start the launch, for safety reasons,
 These two must be the two keys at the same time,

 Put it in the lock and keep it for 10 seconds,
 Only missiles can be launched. Of course, missiles are not as big as rockets launched to the moon.

 But it’s still quite big. You know that the light silo can easily make this classroom wider.

 And many times higher than the classroom.
 The surreal simulation launch they showed us,
 Because someone asked, they also told us one thing,
 There used to be only one key,
 But don't tell us when
 Maybe during the Cuban Missile Crisis
 Because we're almost
 Maybe more than a little worse
 It seems that in 1984,
 There has been another crisis peak
 This year there is a famous movie called
 After the catastrophe
 This movie won at the time
 More reviews than any other movie,
 There was also a saying
 After the aftermath of the nuclear war, the survivors
 All very realistic
 And are all too scared,
 I later found out
 This film is a reason for Reagan’s pressure to restart negotiations with the Soviet Union
 It depends on what you think
 this movie

 Then everyone sees it, 5 years later
 No one foresaw the collapse of the Soviet Union
 And in fact, 1989 did not disintegrate in a sense
 Such a huge machine
 Will not disintegrate all at once, but slowly dissolve over time,
 Sometimes it is faltering and unable to support
 It’s like losing faith in their creed
 On the bright side,

 Russia’s Soviet system,
 Is a collection of multiple provinces,
 Like an empire,
 China and North Korea's current system

 It still exists after the Cold War.
 There are also such systems in Southeast Asia and Africa.

 Are based on Marxist hypotheses,
 The hypothesis holds that utopia exists

 And suppose that in the future utopia,
 Property is shared, everyone
 Have enough
 Everyone can do what they are good at as needed,


 This is a wonderful view, you can imagine
 It will be very attractive
 Even if rationally,
 Because all other systems have
 Huge income gap
 Just like the laws of nature govern
 You can even model this with Pareto distribution
 Pareto distribution is like this,
 It is different from the normal distribution, as you have known before.
 Despite many things
 Are in line with the normal distribution, but the normal distribution still has its
 Not applicable
 If you have played Monopoly, you understand
 What is the Pareto distribution,
 Assuming everyone has at the beginning
 The same amount of money,
 Can be understood as property, the same amount of property,
 Then as the game progresses, like a chance function
 I mean, I know you are using strategy in this game,
 But the basic rule is to buy everything you can get
 Then stingy deals
 At the beginning everyone has the same amount of property
 Then you start the game
 If there are a sufficient number of players theoretically a normal distribution
 Because some people will keep winning relatively,
 While others will keep losing
 Money began to show a normal distribution
 but
 About money and many other things
 0 will get involved
 0 is a strange number,
 If you play a trading game and the asset is 0
 You are out.
 So it is very difficult to recover from 0,
 Just like if you are cursed in the Monopoly game,
 You have some resources when you start
 But when you enter certain hotels, there is a crisis,
 You will be swept out
 At this time, your assets are 0, even if you have something

 If you are lucky, maybe you will be saved

 But you know when bad luck comes
 So what happens when you keep playing Monopoly
 More and more people have property 0
 Fewer and fewer people have more and more
 assets
 When the game is over,
 Everyone has become a pauper, only one person has all the assets
 The interesting phenomenon revealed in this is
 In a sense, this is how the trading game works
 You may want to know why the rich and poor are uneven in society
 It is easy to think of social corruption,
 Maybe
 Society is a bit or very corrupt,
 This has changed,
 There is no society without crime,
 This is inherent composition
 In short,
 Trading games have a tendency to produce Pareto distribution, that is, most people have very little wealth.
 Very few people have a lot of wealth
 This ratio is about 1%, yes
 The number 1% is observed in every society

 It has nothing to do with what kind of government or system,
 This situation must have happened in the Soviet regime,
 Many people die because of extreme poverty
 and so

 Utopian dream
 It’s impossible for many very complicated reasons
 One of them is that when people are trading, it is difficult to
 (Inherent) statistical distribution

 Because it’s just a statistical law, and I should tell you
 Pareto distribution also dominates many situations,
 So, taking the book market as an example, if I remember correctly,
 About a million English books were published last year,
 About 500 of them sold more than 100,000 copies,
 There are many other sets of books sold 0 copies,
 Among these 500 books, one of them is authored by Stephen King,
 He can take about half of the sales,
 Because there are about 5 writers in English books
 In each airport’s paper media shelves,
 All occupy the most conspicuous position,
 (This position) is very valuable, yes, this kind of information is repeated everywhere
 And the location is outstanding,

 If people are in a hurry and just want to find something to read, they won’t care about the name
 Just grab a copy directly from a conspicuous position, so most of the money goes into these people’s pockets, you know,
 Success breeds success,
 Failure breeds failure, this curve need not be linear,
 This is a difficult situation
 Especially in society,
 What we know is
 Extend this unfairness
 People at the bottom of the Pareto distribution
 Will become more and more aggressive,
 It’s like, you can think that men have a threshold for violent behavior
 This situation is important for men
 But not important for women

 This is actually a different state for men and women
 Because men as women’s partners are market-oriented to a certain extent,
 So this is important for men
 Men compete with each other in an unequal society
 Corresponding social status

 If you are in a lower position in society

 Basically no chance to rise
 Because society is not structured
 So men are motivated
 Become more aggressive
 And showing criminal tendencies
 You can think of a crime threshold

 In specific areas such as geography or politics,
 More unfair pressure
 More pressure
 The more men commit crimes above the threshold
 There is a lot of research in drug gangs

 Especially in the Chicago study, a sociologist even went directly into the drug gang
 Maybe the leader of a drug gang,

 It cannot be said that narcissism is inevitable, but it may be a reasonable way to explain the problem

 Maybe he
 Feel complacent about the idea of ​​being the subject of a book
 So this sociologist can
 Get in touch with the drug gang and have a considerable degree of understanding
 Then the housing plan in the drug gang area

 Caused their residence to be demolished and the gang fell apart
 Sociologists got those books
 Because they keep
 He found ordinary street drug dealers,
 They have to find a job first
 Income is well below average
 At the top of the gang
 According to the Pareto distribution, a small percentage of people at the top earn a lot of income
 Bottom
 Wait for the opportunity to see if they have the opportunity to upgrade
 This is quite a violent game
 Maybe some people are out at the top

 It will open up some opportunities to people at the lower levels
 Maybe someone can level up
 So Pareto distribution is reflected in different fields
 Such as on the bestseller list


 This distribution also applies to all areas of human production
 Whether in creative fields such as art or industrial products

 Almost all failures
 Few successes
 Beyond anyone's knowledge
 Take Apple as an example
 They have competitors
 But they have an absolute advantage, earning huge income of billions of dollars
 I don’t know that Apple’s market value is trillions of dollars
 Very close even if not
 This is a lot of money
 If I remember correctly, the 40 richest people in the world
 Has as many assets as the bottom 2 billion people
 It’s not that they stuffed the mattress with money
 Or they have skyscrapers full of money
 The money has lost its economic value
 You can't spend 28 billion dollars
 So sometimes you can do something good with him, such as Bill Gates
 Use the money reasonably
 The reason for talking about the above is that you should know

 Unfairness
 Permeate all aspects of human life
 It's just like
 Scoring in a hockey game, my son told me
 He has stable scoring statistics on the hockey team
 If you don’t count Wayne’s score,
 He still gets enough points as an assist, more than any other hockey player
 and so
 Even at the top of the Pareto distribution

 Some people do what they are good at
 There are other people who do better than these people, even unmatched

 A lot of profits will flow to these places, and you know why this is so
 Like you start writing a book

 In rare cases, some people read your book and they like it
 You have a higher probability of writing a book
 If the reader still likes it, then you will publish a third book, and then the reader will start to understand who you are,
 Because they know you, they will give you some opportunities and your social network will grow
 Your wealth and creativity
 Will grow exponentially

 On the other hand
 If you start to fail, why some people fail,
 A popular idea in our culture is that lack of money leads to poverty. This is a stupid idea.
 Because money is difficult to control, I have a client who is a drug addict
 The worst for them is that they have some money
 They are over, first of all, they are gathered around
 Some people with antisocial personality tendencies
 Especially people who are not optimistic enough to protect themselves well
 Once they have money, they will go to the bar and spend money with friends.
 I was particularly impressed with one person, whenever he has money,

 He will be missing for 5 days, you may find him in the ditch, he will go to the bar,
 Spend every penny on drugs and alcohol
 Wake up in the ditch, dying

 Then he will be ashamed, horrified, and regret
 Then he will regroup until the next check appears
 Then the same thing happened again
 It seems that money is not good for everyone
 It’s difficult to manage money well, and money is easy to lose. I mean, the elderly have a lot of time
 Scammers covet them online all the time
 Just giving money is like pouring water on their hands

 This will not have a great effect
 Of course, giving money to the poor with low IQ is not very useful
 People don’t like the concept of IQ
 Because it seems very arbitrary,
 Feel unworthy of having a high IQ
 Actually IQ was set at the beginning and it is very stable
 You can keep people with high IQs from being educated, make them stupid, and cannot release their own possibilities
 but
 If anyone can improve the IQ of people with low IQ,
 You can definitely apply for the Nobel Prize, because people have tried all kinds of things
 The most recent ones are related to the people of lumosity games,
 This game can live forever anything except from being smart
 We don't know why
 Intelligence is a cross-domain phenomenon
 You can practice in any field until you become proficient
 And hope that this will make you more comfortable in other fields
 Not actually
 So far no one can do it, even if someone claims to be rentable, it turns out to be untenable in the end
 People have tried for a long time and still can’t do it
 Different IQs do make a difference
 Your average IQ is about 125, 130
 115 has exceeded 85% of the population
 But 115 is still not enough for going to a prestigious university
 130 may be able to make you learn something when you graduate
 145 is the top level
 You can do whatever you want
 The higher your IQ, the greater the difference in abilities in different aspects
 For example, you have a very high IQ in language, but not necessarily in mathematics, or other aspects
 But high IQ is still a significant factor in success
 I don't know how to do this
 Why people with high IQ can make more money
 Because of higher production efficiency
 If you sort 1000 people by IQ, people with high IQ will first come up with new ways
 They will also generate more solutions and evaluate which is better
 People with an IQ of 90 account for 15% of the total population
 Think about it carefully, it accounts for 15% of the total population
 This is just a threshold for being able to read the instructions and follow the instructions
 Our society is becoming increasingly complex
 It is clear
 You know what liberals think
 Social injustice is caused by unemployment
 Conservatives believe that everyone should have a shared job
 But neither side has thought that the gap between human intelligence and ability is so large
 Bigger than anyone thought
 This leads to a structural problem
 I have a client
 I found him a volunteer job, which is harder to obtain than expected
 You need a certificate of no criminal record
 Sometimes volunteer work is harder than real work
 But we still helped him get this job
 he needs
 Fold up papers or documents, etc. He works in a charity
 He needs to fold these documents three times so that they can fit in an envelope

 Files are piled up into mountains, and you need to match them with the right envelope
 The envelopes are piled up, some are in French and some are in English
 The French envelope must match the French document
 If there is an envelope out of order
 He must figure out which document matches

 then
 Some documents also have photos or pictures attached
 These cannot be bent
 And they haven’t put them in one place, so we have to find a way to see how to fold the files
 Each situation folds in a different way
 Another thing is
 I never realized how difficult it is to fold the documents into an envelope
 Until i saw someone couldn't do it
 He may have an IQ of about 80
 If you meet him on the street, you won’t notice the difference
 He is just an ordinary person
 Can't see what's wrong
 I was trained to stack these files for about 30 hours
 He did quite well
 If you are good at doing this
 When folded
 The edges must be very precise
 The error cannot exceed 1/2 mm
 Then fold a second time
 The error is the same as the first time
 Assuming the error is 1/8 inch when first folded
 The same goes for the second fold
 It will be a bit deformed, which means the total error is 1/4 inch
 Then I can’t put the envelope
 The envelope will be crumpled and then jammed in the sorting machine

 He tried his best to do this job well
 But the agency still absolutely fired him
 This means
 You can't find a job
 Even a voluntary charity job
 Still decided to fire you
 You understand what i mean
 I communicated with the lady who runs this charity

 Explain that the loss of this job may be fatal to everyone
 Of course she also has her consideration
 He often asks others how to do his job well
 This will affect the efficiency of others
 This is a real conflict, it’s not that she is mean
 She wants to ensure the normal operation of the organization
 This put her in a dilemma
 Soon after this, he finally decided that this job was not suitable for him,
 This is stressful

 He gave up and the problem was finally solved, except that he still had no job is a problem

 Fortunately, this story ended well

 As far as I know, he has a dog because he is very lonely.
 He trained this dog
 Lost 30 pounds
 Because the dog is in a dominant position at the beginning
 He must fight with the dog to decide who has control. Keeping a dog has many responsibilities
 He has a deep relationship with the dog
 Think of ways to live with the dog

 It sounds weird, like a nuclear bomb launching bin. At first, people gathered around him.
 Because he felt he was abusing the dog
 Actually what I saw was that the dog was abusing him
 later
 He got a job training a dog for a lady

 Hurray!!!
 It's a miracle
 Anyway, I tell this story because
 There was a reason for the Cold War
 The reason is
 unfair
 There are different theories attributing unfairness
 For example, why does unfairness exist?
 Marx theorizes
 Human property should be average,
 Some people grab more property from other people

 It’s easy to rule out this concept because the total amount of money is not fixed
 Because of inflation, our technology has become proficient

 Many people are trapped by money because they have a lot of wealth
 For example, Bill Gates, who popularized computing and made computing possible for everyone
 This looks good to him
 The other person is steve Jobs (Apple founder)
 And Elon Musk (paypal, founder of tesla)
 These people can control a lot of resources
 but
 This is not just lying in the money pile

 They want to continue to do things, use the money to do things
 In short
 Russia uses Marxism to guide
 Try to
 Average wealth gap

 It's not an exaggeration to say it's a rare disaster
 Many people here don’t understand this for various reasons
 People will not be taught about this issue
 But in fact, there are statistics that estimate that more than 30 million people were killed in Russia between 1919 and 1959.
 It's cruel

 Many people died of starvation
 I saw a photo the other day and I posted it on Tweet
 This is the worst photo I have ever seen, it contains a lot of information
 I have seen many terrible photos before
 Because I have done a lot of investigations related to totalitarianism
 This photo was taken in the early days of the famine
 During Soviet rule, about 3 million people died
 This photo shows a rural couple
 Selling a human body divided into pieces behind a table in the market
 I have a quirk
 I don’t think it’s good for me

 But it helps me understand things better
 When I see some people do some extreme things

 I realized that this happened many years ago when I was working in a high-level security prison
 I tried to imagine when I was in a situation
 I would do something like this

 Trust me
 This is a terrible thing because
 Actually very likely
 No matter what kind of people you have read about doing unimaginable things, you think you would never do it
 It's actually possible

 Imagine you are in that situation
 This is very helpful for you to understand this phenomenon
 Because for the things you don't want to know

 Necessary for this kind of inspiration


 Imagine yourself as a criminal

 It will make you understand this world, make you understand human nature
 At the same time you have to endure a lot
 In a very structured society, such as Canada
 People are calm
 Because our heater is always heating
 Always have electricity
 There are pipes, it’s a miracle, they have been working normally

 By imagining the completion of this project, I remind myself every day that this is a miracle

 Very cold outside
 Cannot grow any crops
 Stand outside for 24 hours and you will freeze to death
 If any public infrastructure is unreliable at any time, we will be in serious trouble
 But they have never been unreliable
 It's impossible
 Because of the reliable public infrastructure

 We don’t need to compete fiercely with each other

 That means you don’t have to do it for food
 Fierce competition for housing
 It's easy to think that you are a good person

 Because you never do bad things to other people
 Ironically because you never need to do bad things, there is no reason to do bad things

 These reasons have actually risen many times in the past
 Actually this is an axiom, no exceptions
 The reason we are exceptional is because
 Complete social facilities and systems
 It seems to me a little hard to understand that he will exist


 In short
 Back to the industrial age, after the end of the industrial revolution
 The working environment of workers is quite cruel
 George Orwell wrote a book called Road to Wigan Pier
 Describes things in the 1930s
 I guess it should be in the 30s
 Working and living in the mines of this England
 These poor workers
 They have to climb two miles in the tunnel to get to work. They cannot stand in the tunnel

 Then work for 8 hours to chisel coal
 It's difficult, dirty and dangerous
 Of course there is black lung disease, and the income is not high
 After work
 Climb two more miles back
 No reward for climbing the tunnel back and forth, just commuting
 The residence of these people
 It’s not good, and the food is not good. Many people lose their teeth when they are about 30 years old.

 Even in the UK, being poor is not a joke, of course there are many rich people here
 So there are enough reasons
 Think that the uneven distribution of rich and poor is a natural state

 In the west, in 1895, per capita daily consumption was equivalent to today’s $1

 This is not common in most places in the world today

 So there are reasons to consider inequality
 Russia is inspired by Marxism, we are inspired by John Mueller and John Locke


 British classic democracy
 After 70 years of improvement

 This theory now seems very applicable
 But if you consider (damn) competition
 The bottom of this concept will be very different
 These two thoughts have confronted and conflicted, and they have not completely ended yet.
 For example, China, although it is now a mixture of communism and capitalism
 I hope they are more interested in becoming rich
 Greed is the main driving force of war


 During the 1989 incident
 Showed that the Soviet system was not fully functional

 Even in large stores in Moscow, there are not enough consumer goods
 People seem to be losing faith


 For a while, I don’t know if you have heard of the Dallas show
 This is a soap opera that airs at night
 About some of the top 1% richest Texans

 This drama is very popular in East Germany
 The air time is empty

 When sitting on the platform of a Soviet-style building
 You must also fight against the relatives you provide information
 Because at that time one-third of the people in East Germany were government intelligence agents
 Watching the Dallas show is ideologically incorrect

 Feel split

 There was still a small-scale war in Eastern Europe


 But it fell apart in an incredibly peaceful way and became what Germany is now.
 I don’t know if this is related to the Soviets
 at least
 There is no evidence that they are mortal enemies

 The world is getting better

 Except everyone tells you their status is still 40 years ago
 But also better than 50 years ago

 Many people have been lifted out of poverty in the past 15 years
 There have been cases in history where people gathered economic resources

 Want to achieve high growth that the most optimistic cannot predict

 It’s not that we don’t have any problems
 During this period
 I am addicted to

 One question, this question is
 why
 Humans have to develop two camps


 Produce a lot of hydrogen bombs
 I don’t know if you understand hydrogen bombs, they need to be ejected by atoms
 The atomic bomb is already very powerful,
 The hydrogen bomb is more powerful

 At the height of the cold war
 Thousands of these weapons are directed at the Soviet Union and the West

 This is enough
 Destroy everything
 This is a very dangerous game
 Whether for human purpose or accident

 It’s a mistake, or yo people are a bit crazier than expected
 Maybe you would say no one wants to really destroy the world
 This shows that you don’t know enough about Stalin

 All people who lived in power in the 20th century under Stalin’s statistics
 Stalin is
 Often bring things to destruction
 There is a saying that he was murdered by Khrushchev and his staff
 Khrushchev is the next generation of leaders

 If he was not murdered, at least no medical care was provided when he was sick
 There is reasonable evidence that he wanted to invade Western Europe
 He doesn't care how much damage it will cause
 He has persecuted millions
 It won't bother him

 This is just my guess, it's crazy when I do this
 So I started thinking about the belief system
 Because each camp has its own belief system, the Western system was born in Greece/Rome/Jesus/Christ and has
 Very long history

 Also produced in different philosophical systems and inspired by them
 The Soviet system is based on rational philosophy and IQ
 Contrary to the West
 Each system builds a society according to its ideas
 I have been involved in political science for quite some time
 Political scientists and economists agree
 People compete for resources
 But as far as I am concerned, this is not a very good answer, because it is not clear why people think resources are valuable
 Economists just assume that resources are valuable to you
 But in fact, what people think of as valuable is different
 Not completely fixed, maybe you tend to think that food is of high value when you are hungry
 But a lot of things we think have great value are a bit arbitrary, just like making a data

 I am very interested in why people give value to something and what makes something valuable
 Why believe certain things

 How to make certain people believe in certain things,
 Even risking his life to protect it
 At least risking other people's lives
 Maybe in the bigger picture, people finally have their own system
 Belief system is not just a belief system, I started to understand it is not very appropriate
 Too psychological
 People will defend their belief system, this understanding is not completely correct
 We have a shared belief system
 Today’s phenomenon is due to its full sharing
 We don’t know each other, we are a group of primates
 We are in the same room and very peaceful, no one is frightened
 It’s amazing, it shows that we all play our role
 There are certain expectations for these roles
 Matching the two is very important
 We will discuss this in detail
 This is not a belief system,
 Even if it can match the actions of other people in the belief system
 What you need to maintain is this match
 You need to live your faith in the world
 You want what you want to come true
 It’s a good thing, you get what you want, you confirm your belief system, it’s good

 But more often, we interact with each other, such as now
 A series of expectations to pay and regulate our current behavior
 For example, you don’t want me to take your tablet and break it,
 This is shocking, you don't know what to do
 Your situation will be different
 You don't know where you are
 This is another thing
 Because there is a fundamental difference between being in a known and unknown environment,


 You can think of this difference as the difference between the known and the unknown

 If you bring a cat to a new house, the cat hates the new environment
 Because in and around the old house, they have already inspected the surroundings
 Check everywhere along the edge
 Scared at first
 They check everywhere, where they can hide, where they are safe
 Because they went to these places and nothing happened
 Think these places are safe
 They slowly establish a comfortable neighborhood relationship
 My dad used to take the dog for a walk. The cat was a little bored, so he followed him
 Start along the house, around the building
 Hide, then make hunting moves
 After a while, the cat felt relieved and followed behind the dog
 But he still has boundaries
 If my dad took the dog from one block to more blocks,
 The cat is sitting on the corner and crying

 It’s like saying that I don’t want to go further, where I don’t understand


 The difference between the areas that can be controlled and the areas that cannot be controlled is a fundamental difference

 It's like the difference between home and strange unknown territory
 Regarding the fields that people are familiar with, no one is more familiar than others

 Because humans are social
 Don’t understand territories too abstractly. Territory does not only refer to geographical and objective territory.
 There are also levels within the territory
 And the hierarchical structure has a predictable structure
 Most of the time you know where you are best
 So when you practice in it,
 Usually get what you want
 You are also excited about it
 No one wants to be unstable around
 Like you are walking somewhere
 The people around should be very organized, but
 We reorganize everyone and give them freedom
 As a result, pain and dysfunction will appear. This is the consequence of absolute freedom.
 When you pass by someone, he is muttering

 Maybe something has been hit
 When you make eye contact
 Even in a situation like crossing the road, it will definitely make the other person notice
 Then you want to keep your distance and
 Hope it didn't attract the other party's attention
 Because he is not in your rank
 You can't predict what he might do
 This is also an unexplored territory
 Another way to think about this problem is
 We are in time and space, and it is neither pure space nor pure time.
 We are here and now
 It's safe
 Part of the sense of security comes from the physical structure,
 Also because none of you behaves strangely
 If someone behaves strangely
 Such as standing up and yelling
 Or attack the person next to him
 The rest will be petrified in an instant
 Because I suddenly entered an unknown territory
 What you want is a calm lesson and learn some knowledge
 The match between what you expected and what actually happened suddenly disappeared
 Then you don’t know where you are
 Don't know how to act

 If you are a computer, the current state is down
 but
 You realize you are dying, it doesn’t help
 First you will freeze
 Then maybe consciousness is restored, or not, eyes wandering around
 Sit there hoping no one notices you
 This is the reaction to being hunted, just like the rabbit thinks the fox is staring at him
 Humans are prey for a long time
 Recently discovered
 Lower teeth and mouth of prehistoric cat
 be found
 It matches the human skull very well, so the cat can bite through the human skull with this lower tooth
 This is how the lower teeth evolved
 Under such circumstances we have evolved into predators
 But we are delicious hunters, and other hunters are happy to eat us
 So when we don’t know how to respond, we will behave like a predator
 Maybe this should be done when you bow your head and don't speak

 They won't notice you
 Maybe you will survive
 On the contrary, maybe you decide to take the initiative
 Knock down
 but
 Maybe you will become the exception instead of the norm, which is not surprising

 We begin to understand how the belief system manages emotions
 But not all spiritual
 This is a bit like territorial management theory, not that there is a theory in your brain
 But that the theory explains the world
 So make you safer

 It’s more like you have the theory in your mind
 It makes you feel safe because it can explain the world
 As for why this can explain the world because other people have also formed corresponding theories
 When you all practice the theory
 You all got what you wanted, this is a synergy of theory
 The result will form your (personality)
 life

 Prevents you from falling into anxiety and often makes you happy because you get what you want
 This is not just a psychological theory, but a practice in our lives, we cooperate with other sociologists
 We match the belief system and act accordingly
 Form an exact and productive society
 In fact, fear management theory (proposed by Jeff Greengerg et al.) not only protects you from death anxiety
 At the same time saved your life
 This is good, (you) are protected from death anxiety,
 This is good, but not very good, the fundamental thing you are after is
 People have reasons to protect their territories
 If you regard every citizen’s behavior as a fundamentally hypothetical field

 Then there is a reason to defend it
 If it falls apart, there will be a series of deadly chain reactions
 This is chaos, chaos cannot bring people a stable mental state,
 Chaos makes everything unstable, such as currency
 Industry, economy, and electricity will also stop supplying
 This is not a good thing

 No wonder people have to defend it
 Then I started to study what the belief system is

 I realized that the belief system is actually a series of moral codes
 Guide you how you should act
 How to recognize
 Know why ethical codes are necessary for you

 It’s because you can’t know anything out of the hierarchy
 Think about it, how many things you can see in this room
 You can see countless things
 There are squares everywhere, such as small squares on the screen
 You can take a closer look until the end of time, but you didn’t do it
 In fact, if I ask most of you,
 Very few people can tell me the color of the wall
 Even something on the wall
 The reason is that no one cares
 Wall won't move
 I don’t want to care about the color, you have no reason to remember these
 There is no emotional mark
 No value
 So what you would do is
 This is what you are doing now, why are you here
 Not a metaphysical philosophical question, but the specific reason why you are here
 Obviously you are students
 Want to get a degree
 And believe that the degree has practical uses
 Maybe you are a little smarter
 Be good at thinking and writing better, which will make you more useful in the world
 This is a good thing
 Maybe you are interested, anyway
 Now you are listening to this course
 To get the corresponding degree
 Then you can take care of your own life and meet someone who can build a long-term relationship
 Get married and have children, and share corresponding roles in society
 This is why you are here, all these reasons work together

 This helps you decide what to focus on
 So you are watching or listening to my lecture
 Because in principle
 At this moment I am a door leading to this series of life settings

 So your attention is on me
 This is why you think this is valuable
 This means that without a value structure, you have no way of looking at the world
 That is chaos, if everything is equally important or equally unimportant
 This is confusion, so the value prompt,
 To provide you with a way to recognize the world, this is not an abstract concept
 There are enough experimental instructions
 For example, the invisible gorilla experiment, how many of you guide this experiment, how many have not seen it

 Roughly speaking, there are two teams
 The white team and the black team wear clothes of corresponding colors
 The video shows the players of the black team and the white team passing each other non-stop

 Ask you in advance to count how many times the basketball has been passed by the black team members
 Only one basketball
 For whatever reason you work hard

 You do what the experimenter asks you to do
 Count the number of passes
 It’s actually not that difficult, probably 16 times
 You tell them it is 16 this, they say
 Did you see the chimpanzee just now
 Half of the laboratory subjects said, what are you talking about?
 The experimenter said, let’s watch the video again, this time without counting the balls
 About 30s in the video
 The players fill the screen and they are not far away, like a group of ants playing basketball
 You can see their faces clearly

 About 1 minute, there is a person wearing a chimpanzee costume, he and the chimpanzee costume are all normal human size
 He walked into the screen and punched his chest in the middle of the screen for about 5 seconds, then disappeared from the screen
 More than half of the people did not notice this detail. Worse still, Dan Simon did another laboratory
 You make a checkout counter in a store, there is a teller
 You talk to the teller, then the teller squatted down
 Like looking for something, and then another teller stands up
 You think you will definitely notice this
 But not actually
 Even the differences between the staff are more obvious

 People will not notice

 When our attention is focused on a particular thing, we will not notice the others, because the others are not important
 What we are doing

 The teller is replaceable
 As long as they play the role of teller
 that's enough
 and so
 Belief system makes your cognition and value system structure, which can also be called value system
 Structure your perception
 And guide your actions because
 Your actions are consistent with your value system
 Whether it is conscious or unconscious, the value system is working, you don’t know just because you don’t know yourself
 It can also be said that you have a value system that you don’t know
 Sometimes you know this is a mistake, but you still get attracted to some people
 Or you tell yourself to learn, but you don’t
 You can’t control yourself with the goal of getting a degree
 The more unified you are, the more you can control yourself, but you are more like a series of loose
 Sub-personality that can argue with each other, more or less pointing to the same goal
 But it depends on how much you want to achieve this goal, how carefully you think about it, and how possible it is
 How many contradictions in your life have you ever eliminated,

 In any case, the value system governs
 Your thoughts and actions, we will be in the course
 Learn a way of cognition, a very typical way of cognition
 The typical meaning is
 We will based on our expectation that our experience is true

 In this way, the subject cannot be distinguished from the subject. This is not the way to be expected to work.
 It’s more like you are doing a laboratory, including pain
 Pain is not objective, but
 The pain is real, one thing I understand is
 You don't have to believe what I said
 If you want to debate this
 Why some parts don't make sense
 From the thinking triggered by the person (on the street), what I want to express is, aside from basic assumptions, the conclusion I came up with
 The conclusion has not been carefully confirmed, which does not mean
 You can't try, you should try
 Moral system
 Tell you how to show what you see
 The shared moral system keeps your emotions under control and satisfies your motivational needs
 There is a David Hume
 Old ideas
 David. Hume
 Very famous
 He assumes that one thing cannot be assumed to be causally related to another
 In other words, human beings only guide a few objective facts

 Does not guide its application in life
 There is a gap in between, maybe you would say
 This is necessary for scientific work
 One of the jobs of scientists is to strip the value of the object,
 Because I don’t care about the particularity of the object to the individual
 I want to understand how you perceive the object
 It’s possible that everyone at least knows that
 This can completely remove subjectivity,
 This may just be a consequence of the scientific method
 No moral orientation
 People debate this, such as Sam Harris, scientific ethics are born
 I don’t believe it, because I don’t think you can judge the value fairly, it’s too complicated
 Value emerges by itself
 Marxism puts forward the scientific utopia assertion, but it does not work in practice
 In short
 I agree with Hume in general
 You can't say that one thing makes another thing
 This is a problem
 The first problem is that you have a set of facts, but you don’t know how to apply it.
 For example, you should allocate money for AIDS or cancer or higher education
 How to rationally calculate the pros and cons
 There is no corresponding information as evidence
 This is impossible
 I used to work on the UN committee, the committee
 You have hundreds of proposals on how to improve the world, but they are not sorted
 You have to start with something, which means you have to pick an important proposal (you think)
 Obviously in your life
 If everything is equally important, you will be at a loss
 Well known
 A very simple example is
 At the dawn of the scientific revolution
 A wedge
 Has been inserted into the heart of science, this is the moral system that unites us

 The system may be a racial system
 Has been severely criticized by science
 This is very efficient, very useful criticism
 Even if you hold traditional beliefs
 The scientific onslaught is no joke

 This is a problem that exists so far
 You still don't know how to act
 The philosopher Nietzsche would say
 In the West, we run on top of Christian anger
 Christianity has ruled for more than a thousand years, 1500 years, to be precise
 It has developed a whole set of moral system based on a series of physical hypotheses
 And form a social organization
 These social organizations are based on specific beliefs, such as
 What I say next may sanctify everyone’s ideas
 Certain assumptions are put into the law, and certain deep-seated
 E.g. natural human rights
 This is an idea that is regarded as valuable by individuals and the law
 Even if you have committed a crime or should be condemned

 It’s a miracle why people think so
 Roughly speaking
 Humans tend to blame others
 Suppose someone is accused of doing bad things
 Was stoned to death or did anything else to him
 Assuming innocence before there is evidence of a crime, my goodness,
 Everything does not happen automatically, this concept is among the best
 I dare not imagine how this happened, which gave me Xing Que
 Because for me
 There are some valuable ideas (things) beyond any individual assumption
 I will not ask him to make scientific assumptions
 Because this concept is more basic and fundamental

 It is not unreasonable to make laws that society assigns personal value
 Voting is subject to individuals
 The fact is indeed the case, which gives the people the supreme power,
 Such a society seems to work
 But it is not certain that it will still work in the next 300 years
 It has worked at least for the past 500 years
 It's working well now, I assume most of you
 Happy that the law empowers individuals
 You have the right
 Natural human rights
 Show your superman value step by step
 This insight rooted in Nietzsche
 This is also rooted in a series of metaphysical concepts
 His point is
 If these metaphysical ideas are destroyed
 Destroyed all the foundation stones
 It may still take a long time for the entire Faith Building to collapse

 It’s hard to say whether he’s right
 In my opinion, what happened when Nietzsche foretold the death of God
 19 actual late stage,
 Western society oscillates between extreme trends
 Such as Germany where the extreme left and extreme right coexist



 Such as a democratic regime in a sense
 Occupies the middle

 There is no underlying metaphysical support, in my opinion
 The regime is unsustainable
 This is a problem because
 No matter how you look at the underlying metaphysical ideas
 The scientific method is true is not correct in itself
 Because there is more than one kind of truth
 I think there is a pragmatic truth
 The truth is deeper than the truth of science
 The truth of pragmatism makes your practice best,
 Increase the possibility, roughly speaking, maximize your existence and replication
 This is Darwin’s view, one of Darwin’s views
 In my opinion, it is opposed to scientific materialism
 Darwinism believes that there is no privilege to master knowledge
 For example, people will die
 If you know the world well, you will not die, in fact you will die
 The knowledge you master can only make you live to 80

 Maybe you will have children and they will survive
 This is what evolution has done for 30 years
 This is a pretty good solution
 The program has good practicality, do we have better other practices
 Our worldview is actually based on Darwinism
 This may contain the truth of pragmatism
 Instead of objective reality, pragmatic reality can be exploited
 Make us alive, we care if we can live
 We tend to use theory as a tool
 It is possible
 Tools can help us live
 Recently I was reading Camille Paglia, one day
 what
 I found the similarities between us,
 She is notoriously difficult person, I mean feminist
 A classic modern feminist, even though she considers herself a feminist
 Very smart, if you want to see how good someone’s eloquence is,

 She is an expert in expression
 You should read her book (video), in my opinion she is a bit fanatical,
 She speaks quickly and coherently
 Tore her opponent to pieces in the debate, she is very smart
 One interesting thing she said is that she was influenced by some people, who happened to have influenced me.
 She likes the origin and history of Eric Neumann’s consciousness
 If you are interested in Jungian theory, I recommend this book
 The book is a good introduction to the Jung school and the development of consciousness

 And this book is based on the work of Jung and Joseph Cambell
 And Mircea Eliade's, these are all criticized or ignored by postmodernism
 Postmodernism believes that all humans have a central narrative

 The center narrative

 Is a necessary dramatic expression of the human value system

 Rooted in our hearts
 Form part of our nature, we have our nature as humans
 We are not entirely shaped by culture
 This is what postmodernism claims, the idea is dangerous
 The danger lies in thinking that we are natural
 Palia holds this view
 The reason you came to university, you studied the humanities, or other possible reasons

 It’s not about participating prematurely and criticizing and destroying something under the ignorant Qin Guang,

 but
 Study as much art, literature and poetry as possible

 drama
 Fiction
 Rigorous thinking
 All of these you can think of as
 what?

 This is the category of art, culture, music
 We talk about music as if everyone loves it, or almost everyone
 This is a mystery
 You listen to music, it's interesting
 Music will make people survive quite dark times. Why?
 The answer is not obvious,
 Music plays an important role on specific occasions in many cultures
 I think you may find the most beloved music in your time
 I heard it between your 16-20 years old
 Like your mark
 May define a whole generation
 Maybe in the past tribal period, it was more like
 The tribal customs that you were taught,
 Dancing to the music with a mask
 At the same time, you are invited to such occasions
 And play a certain role in it
 It is not correct to regard this as a representation of the objective world of things.
 This is an invitation to enter the drama
 Now the question may be transformed into, is the drama real?
 the answer is
 It depends on the true definition
 I think great dramas are more real than real, they are super real

 Because it abstracts it out and provides general guidelines
 Used in a very wide range of situations
 Let's imagine
 You get up in the morning
 Did a lot of things
 Someone asks you what you are doing, what are you doing
 You tell them to open their eyes first
 Then I wonder if I should continue to sleep
 Then lift the blanket and step on the floor
 Stand up, blink and breathe while doing this

 Then start looking for clothes. Do you really want to hear such an answer?
 You don't want to listen, why are you telling me this?
 I want to hear something interesting
 What is interesting? And why are these things not interesting?
 The answer is not obvious
 Imagine this person tells you a very good story, a bit adventurous
 Maybe
 He is doing something very normal and something unusual has happened
 He had to find a way to respond
 Has he solved this problem? This is what interests you
 Especially when he gets it done, because
 When he tells you how he handles certain unexplored areas
 He will also systematize it
 Maybe when you encounter such a situation, you can handle it accordingly
 This is quite cheap wisdom for you, he has to find a solution
 All you have to do is listen
 This is a classic story, roughly speaking
 This kind of story is usually about a man or a woman, it doesn’t matter
 Life is quite normal
 Suddenly hit, they fell into chaos

 Chaos is such a place
 Stop what you are doing
 The world no longer matches (with your cognition), chaos can be divided into many degrees, such as when you wake up
 Found that your room was stolen, and your parents had Alzheimer’s disease,
 Or some serious diseases
 Or your family is murdered, the war begins,
 There are many levels of confusion
 You can
 Judge the degree by calculating how much you were interrupted by the event


 The higher the interruption, the higher the instability
 This is why if someone tells you that you will be destroyed in pain within 3 months,
 Is very bad
 You are facing an unpredictable field, your original assumptions and ideas are not true
 Generally speaking, the world is no longer real
 We like to see people lead their usual lives
 Blind to some things
 Going through the transition period when it just entered a state of chaos,
 Collect new information
 Reshape their personality, or reshape the world, both are solutions
 Then come out from the other side
 Things are better than they were at the beginning
 At least not bad, good results, right?
 This is a good ending, comedy, technically
 You want your life to be a comedy
 But not funny
 Because comedy doesn’t have to be funny,
 Just the opposite of tragedy
 The tragedy is that when you go through these things, you choose to blindly see, (seems) to handle it well
 This situation does happen, at any time. But what you want is comedy
 right now
 I hope I can provide you with a magic code

 A book was released a while ago
 Movie starring Tom Hanks
 He was a professor at Harvard University, solving symbol-related puzzles
 Do you remember what this is called
 Da Vinci Code, everyone loves it, this book is a big hit
 It’s full of small mysteries and all kinds of hints. These hints about the world are beyond your imagination.
 This is absolutely true
 There are ways to learn this knowledge, and it's worth it
 People like this idea because of its authenticity


 Just like the novel is true, let’s go back to telling you what happened after you got up in the morning.
 If he tells something exciting,
 Imagine 10 people tell you something exciting
 You will extract a picture of such things
 Then when you are a writer, you will apply it to the book
 In the book, you don’t want the plot to be about ordinary people
 Doing normal things in their lives
 You already know how to be an ordinary person, but it doesn’t help writing novels
 After all, no one wants to watch a video about himself
 Imagine you record your own day and watch it the next day
 You will think, oh my god, who would want to watch this
 So in the story they will refine

 They observe people,
 They told the story they saw, but removed most of the story
 All the boring content is removed, hope so
 Exciting story details stack up
 Maybe a great writer was born and write some really interesting stories
 Significant role transformation
 And when you say it's fiction
 You would say it's not true
 Because he is fictitious
 But this is not necessarily correct
 Maybe more real
 Because who wants truth, truth is ordinary reality, you have already mastered it
 What you want is refined
 Interesting experience
 Maybe you will say, why is it interesting, this is a good question, because you are not really
 Understand and believe me, you don’t know why you find meaningless things interesting
 Today I will start with Pinocchio, I will talk more about it next time
 I want to talk a little bit about how this movie started, and you will know how crazy you are
 You all know the plot, how many of you have seen Pinocchio?
 Many people
 Many people have seen
 This thing itself is quite strange
 It’s worth thinking about, usually you tend to show such movies to children
 But if you think about the movie content
 I think it’s weird to sit down and watch this movie
 First of all, this is a sketch animation with very low resolution
 You don’t care, you may also watch the Simpsons
 There is also a cartoon dedicated to mocking politics: South Park
 The animation of this cartoon really sucks out of the sky
 Yes, it sucks, it can't be worse
 You don't care
 Round head,
 Smiles and eyes like fans, you can only tell that this is a person
 It’s all irrelevant, even if you use higher pixels, it won’t help.
 You only need a summary,
 To feel attached
 therefore
 You watch these animations, Pinocchio, very beautiful animations
 play in order
 You are not watching something real, you are watching purely broken structures
 Recall the plot
 Very ridiculous, everything is ridiculous
 One character is insect
 It feels like consciousness, what the hell is this?
 Another character is a puppet, a marionette
 For some reason he escaped from the rope and started an adventure
 Then he was lured by a fox and a cat
 To different evil places

 Then he rescued his father from the whale
 You don’t even know how his father got into the belly of a whale, the last time you saw his father
 It was in heavy rain, and what happened next was that he was in the belly of a whale
 You sit there and think, "Hey, no problem, that makes sense."
 what? Really?
 why?
 Why does this make sense?
 The answer is you don't know
 This is cool
 You don't know, you don't even know what you are looking at
 But it doesn't matter
 You watch it and you are interested, you want to know what happened to this doll
 Do you want to know if he eventually became a real boy
 Because this looks important
 You ask: Is Pinocchio real?
 This is a stupid question
 Because the answer is that it depends on how you define reality
 and
 The definition is not obvious to me
 When you say something is true

 What should you express
 The answer is not obvious because
 There is such a concept in our society and its influence is far-reaching. This concept is that the ultimate reality is the scientific reality.
 This tells us the world itself, in some ways
 Indeed, there is no objection
 Physicists have discovered the correct law, which is why we can make hydrogen bombs. This is a strong evidence of scientific correctness.
 But even if it’s true you don’t know how to practice

 You observe things, are attracted and confused by them
 No inference can be formed based on the known construction
 to me
 What the world is made of is a question, another bigger question is
 How do you interpret yourself in the world
 This is what you really want to know, more than any other question
 Because you need to know, like you are in college now, but don’t know what you are doing
 Some people know a little bit more than others
 But you are still in the early days of life,
 Life is very complicated and chaotic
 It’s not obvious what kind of relationship you should build
 What kind of personality should you shape
 What kind of job do you want to do
 Or what is the meaning of life, this is a good question, what is the meaning of life
 As you know, people come to college, at least most, want to figure out the answer to this question
 Now paglia, her opinion is
 You should think like this, clear knowledge
 Contained in unclear knowledge
 The unclear knowledge is
 Literary and artistic
 High-level culture
 We probably know what this means
 But we can’t clearly know its meaning, its meaning is more than we know
 The outside is the realm we all know
 This is the point of view of Jungian theory, and perhaps Paglia got it from it
 Because Jung believed
 In any field, there are parts that we fully control

 Beyond this you see it as an unexplored field
 When our creative imagination meets the unknown,
 We will use creative imagination
 To figure out how to deal with the unknown, we created drama
 And perform plays, which can help us deal with things that we can’t control
 We know nothing outside of this field
 Paglia’s view is also Jung’s view,
 Don’t understand what’s around you will be too
 Atomization
 You are not part of your historical tradition
 You haven't absorbed the spirit of your ancestors
 Ancestors established all these traditions
 You just exist in the present

 You don’t know what to do, you don’t know how to maintain your tradition, and you don’t know how to serve it

 You may ask why you should serve the traditional
 I have an imaginary,
 You can think of it this way, I don’t know if this is correct, but
 The meaning of people’s lives, for me
 The meaning is to take appropriate responsibility
 You know, for example
 You have a three year old sister
 You have to take care of her
 It seems silly to question whether this is a good idea
 I mean, this is not a question to ask
 obviously
 Self-explanatory, this is what you have to do
 Do you want to find meaning in it?
 You are interacting with a child
 When I have children, they are 2 years old or younger
 We take them out for a relative
 They are older
 They looked at a 2-year-old child like a fire
 Every second the child is in the house
 Every adult
 Are following them
 This is what people tend to do
 This is a certain meaning, what else is meaningful, your family members are meaningful to you
 Maybe the sense of responsibility as a friend is also meaningful
 Maybe you decide to pursue a career and become a useful person in society
 Some of the dominant factors are
 Because of your desire to be safe or to succeed, that makes sense
 But you also
 Need to play a complete role in the social structure, which supports you, my observation is
 In my consultation process, when people have nothing to do
 There is too much time to run out,
 I have to go to work at 9:00 in the morning, the arrangements are very strict
 Maybe I should be grateful for this, I noticed that when people break away from external system constraints

 They are like floating
 They will be depressed and restless, they don’t know what to do, just like sled dogs are not pulling a sled
 We are like sled dogs, carrying weights, we need to carry weights

 The question is what kind of load do we need
 The reason we need is

 I have thought about what the truth is for a long time,
 Because i am an existentialist
 My actions are based on the premise that you can infer what people believe by observing how people behave
 I don't care what they say
 I don’t care what they claim to be their opinion of truth
 Because speaking and doing are directly related
 Sometimes very low or even non-existent
 One thing I noticed is
 No one will argue with others about their pain
 Everyone injured
 Behave like they believe the pain is real
 So we can say
 The ultimate truth is pain
 This is what people show
 The claims in this multi-ethnic tradition are consistent
 Jesus always
 Recall the pain of the past
 I mean that the God of Christianity was crucified. This is painful. For Buddhists, the most basic belief is that living is suffering.
 In my opinion this is a philosophical view

 This view holds that the pain is real
 Of course it really depends on your definition of truth
 But people always act as if the pain is real, this is a starting point for thinking about problems
 Now this points to a problem
 Life is painful
 Life is miserable, why
 Because you will get hurt
 And destroyed

 It seems self-explanatory, you know
 It also makes people unique. This is our consciousness, right?
 In a sense, this can really distinguish humans from other creatures.
 I mean, some other creatures are also self-aware, like chimpanzees
 You can learn to recognize yourself in a mirror, and so can dolphins
 But this is a very conceptual sense of self
 True self-awareness is to recognize one's own boundaries
 Not only space, but also time
 So far, humans are the only creatures that can discover the future
 This is great because we can plan for the future, but it also has disadvantages
 Because the future is limited, this is a big shock to the old system
 Everyone bears and endures pain is a burden of reality
 Then you think, life is suffering and finite, this is also part of suffering
 This will prompt you to question the value of existence
 Existence itself may be value
 One of the weapons against the emptiness of existence
 It’s the sense of responsibility we mentioned earlier, it feels feasible
 How much responsibility do you take in your relationship with things
 It looks like
 It can improve your sense of meaning when you participate, maybe you will say, when is meaningful participation,
 How about alleviating a little bit of suffering
 You know, in your life this can be
 Reduce unbearable pain, especially meaningless pain
 This is a good thing, maybe you can be more useful,
 You can solve some of your suffering and other people’s sufferings like hitting a home run,
 Maybe you will find a way to heal you
 If pain makes you question life, it makes sense
 This end of pain
 Minimize suffering
 As a result of logical inference, it should be a suitable compromise
 I would say it means
 There are some patterns
 Can make you immerse yourself in it and become a better person
 and
 One of the benefits of being a good person is
 Can alleviate suffering

 You should have no doubts here
 If suffering itself makes you question the value of life
 Then you can’t say it’s useless when the pain can end
 You can say this, but it is actually inconsistent. If you want, you can declare the inconsistency.
 I think
 These refined stories
 From a great author
 I especially admire Dustoevsky
 his job
 He is the best novel among the authors I have read so far
 No one can surpass, he can deal with the most difficult problems of mankind


 He can simultaneously shape the argument of opposite roles, and indeed makes the debate fully revealed
 This is not to say that Dostoyevsky
 There is a concept, and then the concept of giving him the role, which makes this role always win the debate
 This never happened in Dostoyevsky’s novels
 You set the character, then set 3-4 opponents
 These opponents are not scarecrows, they are like steel giants
 They trample on the protagonist ruthlessly, this is a war of different ideas between the protagonist and the opponent
 It's amazing to read
 Great writers can distill stories
 The great storyteller refines the story
 Some stories are very very old
 It is often religious stories in various forms, and some can also be myths
 Because mythology can be traced back 10,000 years ago
 This is part of oral tradition
 Oral tradition can exist for thousands of years
 If a story has been told for ten thousand years, it must be a very interesting story and people must remember it
 Obviously it has also been modified. It's like a game of spreading. Let me tell you one thing. Tell you one with a laugh. Keep going.
 Lasted for thousands of generations
 The last part that people remember is the part they think is important, because people tend to remember what they think is important
 What this means is not necessary for you, you don’t know the meaning of music
 but
 This is not preventing you from listening to music
 You usually don’t know what a movie or book you’ve seen is talking about
 Because they have multiple meanings, they are usually deeper than you can understand
 Otherwise why read it
 There is a view like this
 You need to be rooted in the moral system, which is described by words
 Can be drama

 The moral system can guide us in life
 The reason for understanding this is that at some level you can understand
 Because you need to know how to survive
 Nietzsche said if you have a problem and you can bear it

 This is good, the guards of Auschwitz once did one thing to prisoners
 It’s worth mentioning that there is a slogan in Auschwitz
 Work makes you free
 This is actually a joke
 Not very funny
 This is a joke that has to be evil
 Conceptualize in a suitable time

 Then be declared
 When Osconsin’s range arrived, they were already in very bad condition
 They were sent in a truck
 They are classified with their families and deprived of everything
 Tossing around for a long time and standing still
 Because there is not enough space, the children have difficulty breathing and the space is very small
 No food, no toilet
 There is about 20% of the death rate during transportation, and people standing outside the livestock cart were frozen to death

 Very cruel
 When they arrive in Wisconsin, the guards will play this game
 They will say that work makes you free
 They will find a prisoner,
 This prisoner is dying
 Let them carry a sack of damp salt, about 100 pounds
 From one end to the other

 You might think that the prison is the size of a football field with protective nets around it, but it’s not
 This is like a city, there are thousands of people
 It’s a long walk from one end to the other.
 This is not bad enough, they have to move the bag of salt to the starting point

 To this malicious poetic statement is what is being done
 Is to use human force for useful activities
 It's okay to skim away the difficulties
 Looks like this is a bad thing
 People need
 Meaningless parody,
 People need meaning because life is hard
 Problem makes
 What is your purpose in life
 Another question may be, does it matter whether the word is interesting
 Because what matters is what matters, but what matters is what matters
 I think what matters is more real than what matters
 At least you behaved like this, then the question is, should you set a goal?
 This is a good question, this question is about the meaning of life
 One thing that should happen when you come to university
 Yes basically find the answer to this kind of question
 so far
 Maybe I’m too cynical, the college students I saw,
 Attached to the remains of their culture

 Floating around like fragments
 These fragments will be taken away by the professors who told them that anything can be broken,

 No, these ideas have no practical meaning
 When you finally graduated, it was like duckweed flowing to the ocean, you left nothing
 You're done, you can graduate
 But i don't see anything useful in it
 In contrast to
 I tell you a story
 First of all, I’m going to give you suggestions, which we will elaborate on
 You live in a story, through the frame of the story
 Looking at the world, it’s like a story,
 When this story is where you are
 And you are going to somewhere else
 This can be conceptualized,
 There is a gradient between where you want to go and your goal,
 What are you doing when you sit there
 Assuming your goal is better things
 Usually you are in an insufficient state

 Insufficiency changes
 Then you try to correct the deficiency
 It is generally believed that your current state is always not as good as the state you want to achieve
 Usually the way you bridge the gap is
 Sometimes you can think
 But the more essential situation is through practice
 You through practice in the world
 This can partially answer the mind-body question
 You have a conceptual structure and when you apply it
 It is not abstract, you use it through practice
 This is the most basic story, not so attractive
 But this is a framework for you to see the world, a framework that carries value
 Otherwise you can’t practice and you can’t understand how to look at (the world)
 This is a value-laden framework
 Through this framework, we can say what is the starting point of the best value framework
 This is the problem we are trying to figure out
 Now I’m going to talk about the war between the communists and the western world.
 Why does it attract me
 One thing is
 I really want to know about autocracy
 Similar to communists and the West, there are certain axioms
 If you are a moral relativist, you might say
 A certain type of axiom set is better
 Even, think that a series of axioms, one system is better than another
 This is the point of view of a moral relativist, and you know
 So before I thought it might be more arbitrary by force
 This is how people deal with two competing systems (arbitrary statement)
 No room for discussion and negotiation
 I have been thinking about this for a long time, I want to know
 Where are the roots of the Marxist system and the Western system
 I guess the western system is formed after long-term evolution
 And the communist system is imposed by rationalists
 It's not the same thing, then i want to know
 Where is Western culture rooted, and is there any reason why it is reasonable on any level?

 This prompted me to study and learn the underlying story
 Based on the basic stories of our culture, I believe that some of them are very old
 Next, I will tell the story of Mesopotamia, which is one of the oldest stories we know, and the story of Egypt.
 These are the origins of our culture
 I think these stories are rooted in older traditions
 They map some reality
 Very real,
 I mentioned before
 There are different ways and concepts to understand the truth
 My initial hypothesis is that you might also think it is an axiom
 Pain is the most real, because this is how people behave.
 You can criticize it
 Of course you can also come up with other alternative conceptual frameworks, such as those used by scientists
 Because they believe it is important to pursue the truth of things
 Maybe we need more than one way to interpret the world
 this is possible
 Now what I want to say is what I think is the most essential
 Elements that make up the story

 I hope one of them is
 Knowing it can make you
 Immune to ideology
 The reason is that I think ideology is intermittent and incomplete
 Meta-narrative, the reason they have power is
 They are rooted in meta-narratives, but they only tell part of the story
 But they still have power because they are rooted in the essential narrative
 Its characteristic is

 People tend to characterize the world, we are social primates
 We tend to see the world through the glasses of social roles
 Because we practice in the world and the world is full of other people
 So we conceptualized it into personality terms based on this structure,
 To guide action
 The most essential reality is chaos
 You can't understand confusion
 Settings cannot be conceptualized
 You can only touch the edge of chaos

 When the twin towers collapsed
 The chaos occupied quite a while and everyone was in shock
 This is chaos, it is your experience when your story falls apart

 Fall under the unknown
 This is chaos, basically you live in order and chaos, order is
 You know what to do when and where, and you get what you want
 Also known areas to be explored
 Chaos is when you do something and hope for a certain result,
 But it didn't happen
 At this point you will be in chaos
 Chaos has different depths,
 When chaos occurs, your life can fall apart very badly
 , Like falling to hell
 You are in chaos and realize that it is your own problem
 You did something wrong
 You know and ignored it
 This is your bad mess
 When chaos occurs
 What followed is very straightforward
 You can think of individuals in culture

 Culture is contained in nature
 Naturally matrilineal
 Culture is patrilineal
 I think this is because of the hierarchical structure of human nature
 Is machismo
 Nature is likened to a woman because
 Two reasons, one is that all women play the role of sexual selection in human history
 From the perspective of Darwinism
 Second, because it is naturally biologically productive
 We often conceptualize men and women
 To organize the world

 This is a metaphor
 But far beyond metaphor, it is reasonable to compare culture to a picky father
 because

 Because a group of people gather around you, some are friends, some see how you work, some evaluate you
 After a long time of evolution
 These people accumulate to form an entity
 Constantly review and criticize you
 It is also reasonable to personify it
 It’s like a Yuanren is watching you

 This is a useful analogy, there is a meta-man who is watching you
 Yes it is obvious
 You can say it's not real
 It’s not true on the scientific level, but it’s also another form of truth.
 Nature has two elements, destruction and creation
 Nature has a beautiful and generous side

 It’s also Anopheles, Elephantiasis, Cancer
 The terrible side of hunger
 And culture is authoritarian
 Because you have to shape yourself (to adapt to the culture), unconsciously get along with other people,
 You have to sacrifice many parts of yourself and develop yourself
 As a result, we have to balance ourselves to adapt to social life
 Some societies are more authoritarian than others
 But they all have authoritarian elements, and it’s no exception on college campuses, you all know
 Big here
 It’s easy to feel like you’re overwhelmed like numbers, it doesn’t matter whether you are here or not
 The school doesn’t care, it’s authoritarian
 But the school cares because you are here and you are receiving education
 Maybe this is the positive side
 Each feature has two sides
 Nature has positive and negative properties
 Culture also has a positive and negative nature, including individual
 The individual is like standing on an island in the center of the ocean

 The place you are in has a positive concept
 Solid ground, limited extension, other parts you don’t know
 As an individual you also have positive and negative elements
 There are heroes and villains
 Of course, if there are no heroes and villains in the story, what else to see
 The villain is the part that people show that should not be shown, the hero is the part that should be shown
 When you watch a movie or read a book, there are heroes and villains in it
 To some extent this will give you a concrete understanding of the villain
 When you meet about 30 villains, you will have a conceptual understanding of what villain behavior is
 This is the core element of the villain
 No matter what
 You can imagine building a meta villain for you
 Or meta heroes, these are the characters in the old stories
 in general
 In the Marvel movie
 There is Odin, he has two sons
 Thor and Vulcan Loki,
 Thor is a recognized hero, Vulcan is a liar who always wants to destroy everything
 You can identify these by yourself
 This is useful because even if you underestimate
 [Student question] Is this a positive spirit?
 No, this is a map of meaning
 Positive spirit
 Certainly not
 Why might you become vicious?
 First because you can
 This is critical
 This is actually a branch of empathy
 It took me decades to figure out
 What I want to understand when I study Genesis
 In this book
 When people become conscious, they immediately understand good and evil
 I can't understand, what is the connection between these?
 I think this problem is about 30 years
 I want to solve this mystery, and then I want to understand
 When you are self-aware
 You can conceptualize yourself as a creature
 You know what you are
 You know what you look like
 Know what can hurt you and what can't
 Soon, you know what can hurt you
 You know what can hurt her
 Good and evil also arise with self-consciousness
 There are some characteristics that make humans fundamentally different from other species
 Lions eat you
 But it won't torture you slowly
 Just for pleasure
 It just eats you
 You can think this is evil, it must be very bad
 But animals are actually beyond the concept of good and evil, but humans,
 We can be very evil, we are very good at it
 Because we will imagine that if it hurts me, it will hurt you too
 You need to know your possible behavior, because this is you
 If you think you wouldn't
 Actually you will behave similarly more than you think
 Because the people who have this behavior most often are those who think they will never do it
 You need to fight it
 This is why in many systems conceptualizing the world is a war between good and evil
 This is a reasonable conceptualization
 Meta concept
 Culture is a wise and authoritarian king, always like this
 You are often stuck in it, because as an individual, you have both positive and negative sides
 The negative side is full of resentment and is easily provoked
 Is limited
 Suffering is inevitable, this is the tyranny and unfair side of nature
 No wonder you have a dark side
 This is not a trivial matter
 In the Karamazov brothers, arguing is very artistic
 There is a character called Alise, he is a monk apprentice, not outstanding in talent
 But he is a good man. His brother is called Ivan, who is a genius for evil
 One of the ways Ivan tortured Allese was to tell a story that Dostoevsky later changed into a new story

 This story is about a pair of parents taking their little daughter
 Once locked her out all night
 It was very cold outside, she stayed outside crying and screaming until she died of freezing
 Ivan will basically give Alese these
 Something that shouldn't have happened in reality
 This is a good argument, you can even cite thousands of similar examples
 Part of us is always trying to prevent us from being, full of resentment
 This is a good idea
 As far as I know, if you show this
 It will make you worse
 Maybe you should be happy about it
 You might think that people don’t do such things when they are conscious
 But they will
 I recommend you to read Karpenzram (Perverted Murderer), if you are interested in such issues
 The author of this book raped thousands of men and killed dozens
 Do your best to destroy everything
 Want to start a war between Britain and America
 No goal except killing
 He wrote an autobiography at the request of a doctor who also encountered his
 He recorded in detail what he did and why he did it
 this story
 Heroes and opponents
 Order and power, destruction and reconstruction
 This is the most basic picture outside of chaos, let’s rest for a while
 This is another way of looking at

 The individual may concentrate, explore, master
 Or distracted elsewhere

 People stay in the explored field
 This is the unexplored field
 No matter where you go, you have two opposing halves
 You have to fight for yourself
 No matter where it is, as long as there is a human society, there is autocracy and beneficial nature
 In a sense, society is what you are doing matches what is happening
 This is very important, unexplored area
 No matter when and where, your experience is invalid
 This is not a geographical concept, because when you think about a known field
 What you think of is the geographical realm, like an animal land, your house

 This must be an element of the territory, but you know
 When you are at your home, a snake sneaks into your living room, you are right there
 There is a major difference between the house 1 second ago and your house now
 Your house can become unknown as soon as the hat drops because you are in time and space
 Unexplored areas are conceptualized
 This is a conceptual field, which refers to when your experience is not available wherever you are

 Human experience has its permanence
 This is what I think is the basic element in our narrative
 This is part of you
 There are some themes of stories
 The subject is a self-contradictory person with many different potentials
 You are always with other people somewhere
 Because this is our territory
 I mean social animals
 Even our ancient ancestors, many of their territories
 There are other primates too, we classify the world into accumulating characteristics
 This is very important to us, and it is our tendency to look at the whole world
 Uncharted territory
 Is where you don't know how to act
 But when you don’t know what to do, you actually know what to do
 This is quite normal, our pressure feedback system will behave as
 Freeze, generally speaking, if the threat is big enough
 You secrete a lot of cortisol and adrenaline, which can make you
 Always ready to act fast
 If you pay attention
 This is what you do when you don’t know how to do it, the problem is that you can stay in this state forever
 This is also a traumatic post-stress disorder state
 You will always be in this state
 The problem is that it’s very uncomfortable
 When you stay in this state for a while, you will feel frustrated
 Will produce disorderly anxiety and you will grow old
 Because it consumes a lot of energy and energy quickly
 Your body system has been delaying all problems to respond to the current state of emergency

 It's very energy consuming
 This is not what you want
 This is one of the reasons why people tend to defend their territories
 because
 If their familiar territory is invaded or disturbed
 They will enter a state of emergency
 This will strip you away and have a profound impact
 You understand this state
 When people are betrayed by someone in close relationships, they usually
 Will experience this feeling
 Or people lie

 The dream I've been pursuing is broken
 Or family members’ illness or death, etc., but betrayal is the most typical
 Because you have been with someone for a long time and you trust him
 In this relationship you represent your past and present
 You describe this relationship
 And the future related to it
 You’ve been betrayed, it’s like bum, even the past is different from what you once thought
 about you
 You have no clue
 Why is it so easy to be deceived, you don't know, is this your fault?
 So stupid that I can't protect myself
 Or others are so vicious that you don’t even notice
 Everything is floating in the air, it's no good
 There is also a concept that humans travel around the underground world
 Come back again, this is a useful way to understand, because
 We often do
 Whenever we fail, it’s like suddenly falling into the underground world
 Everything is in chaos there
 Maybe we organize ourselves and come back again
 So, a way to conceptualize yourself, not order
 Not chaos
 But in between
 I think it’s a mythical hero

 So I will start with Pinocchio
 Quite weird
 I hope you can find fun in it
 Why start with Pinocchio because
 Because I hope to introduce the abstract knowledge mentioned above into examples

 So easy to think
 To conceptualize knowledge like I said above, are they good for everything?
 Do they help
 This is the order in the chaos in hiding
 Establishment of order
 Heaven has fallen, secular history
 Heaven is rebuilt, this is a classic comedy
 Is also a story of life

 The question is how much you can control him

 Everyone wants to know the answer to this question
 Very weird, you will pay
 Pay online to see related stories
 Even if you don’t know what these stories are really telling
 The reason is
 Some part of you knows what these stories are telling
 Your perception is hierarchical
 You understand things you don't know

 Through many ways you don’t understand, you can feel
 We mentioned a little Pinocchio story, which is ridiculous
 But not important
 Student - I have a question, is chaos that people do not act in a way that you expect and cause you negative emotions,
 Something bad happened
 What if the opponent’s actions are very positive, such as winning a big lottery
 You still get into a stress response, or?
 This is the same situation
 No, this is not the same situation, this is a good question
 Let's think about it
 Usually winning the big lottery is not good for people
 This amount is too much
 To them
 Has changed their lives drastically

 The best situation is to continue living their previous emotions and life as much as possible
 But this is indeed a great thing
 I mean, at least better than other very bad things
 But it still brings instability
 It depends on what element in your life it will disrupt
 It can be understood that you have a map of action in the world

 This map is either superficial or profound
 Different preset composition
 When the profound preset is destroyed
 Huge blocks in the map will be invalid
 sometimes
 It also occurs when particularly severe positive events occur
 When the basic law, the more concepts are disturbed,

 Harder to recover
 When you win the big lottery, maybe you will quit your job
 I want to go to the beach, I want to have a Margarita
 Maybe you can be cool for a few days in this state
 When you live a life of drunkenness and dreams for 3 months on the beach, it can be considered an improvement.
 It’s not as easy as it seems, when you make people deviate from their daily routine
 They will be confused
 Their routine is broken, they don’t eat normally, and they don’t know what to do

 This is why retirement is difficult for many people
 I am about to retire
 When I relax for two weeks, maybe I will die
 I need to do something
 I need to devote myself to something
 Closer to home
 Pinocchio, an early Disney movie, very genius
 So I will lead you to interpret
 And tell you what I think it means

 You can also express your thoughts, which is beneficial to our understanding
 Today I will only talk for 10 minutes, try to be as detailed as possible
 We will continue next class
 Beginning of the video
 Cast list
 Is carved on wood, which is a hint
 Because Gaby is a carpenter, the background music is
 A very popular song
 a little bit
 Uh, how would you describe it
 I do not think so
 This is a very profound poem
 But this is a song that people love and listen to today
 Set the tone of the movie, this is the role of music
 One of the most mysterious things about the film is

 When you watch a movie, there is always background music
 If the movie has no background music
 It feels a little hollow, like missing something

 When you watch a movie, there are a lot of things you can’t see,
 For example, the role is partial
 You don’t understand the background, it’s like low resolution
 The role of music seems to provide an emotional background to the complex context of the film
 Like some kind of substitute for content
 Guide you into the video settings
 It gives a hint that the movie is about to happen
 The most interesting thing is that we have no objections to this
 Just like the movie has background music
 When the plot changes drastically, the music also changes drastically
 But it doesn’t happen in real life (background music)
 Maybe you are wondering why we can accept music in the film
 Part of the reason may be that we tend to accept exaggerated reality
 This makes up the movie
 In fact, we found that the ability of music to amplify dramatic effects is very significant
 We can accept
 This song is very interesting, so I plan to analyze it a little bit
 Sometimes I feel stupid to do this, because this song is a bit childish
 This is a childish song

 But it’s okay, when you make a wish to the stars, it doesn’t make you any different
 Yes, people wishing to the stars is a somewhat mysterious act
 Some sense of ritual
 why
 People want to do

 What exactly do the stars represent
 This is another question
 Because the stars shine in heaven
 Some people are stars

 Why do people make stars to chase stars
 Stars are usually very famous people,
 They attract a lot of attention
 Maybe these people are very talented,
 Maybe they are idols, not just supermodels, they are imitated
 This is what it means to be a star, and why the magazine is full of stars
 Like they are heroes brought to the world
 Of course you don’t know anything about them, only the public image
 Of course they are usually charming
 People will project the perfect personality on them
 They are stars
 But why make stars to chase stars? Stars can be summoned in the dark, right
 They are from another world
 They don’t belong to the earth, this is a cool place
 Technically
 The stars obviously do not belong to the earth,

 And in terms of phenomena, it is like an element of human experience
 Many of you are from the city
 There is not much experience and opportunity to see the night sky full of stars
 This is a pity because
 The starry night sky is awe-inspiring
 Naturally you will feel this
 When you look up, the stars are all over the night sky
 You are looking at the edge of the Milky Way, the milky white band
 You will be amazed
 This is the edge of the Milky Way
 There are countless stars, very vast, like looking towards infinity
 Look into the unknown, look beyond you
 Definitely
 This makes people feel awe, like seeing a huge canyon or similar picture
 You are looking at something beyond yourself, this sense of awe
 Is a natural part of our feedback system
 Maybe you will feel awe when you meet someone you respect and desire
 Because you think they have something extraordinary
 Have a very interesting idea
 There are people you admire and don't admire

 This is a clue to your value system
 Maybe you can’t tell why you find some people attractive
 Admirable
 It’s like you’re looking for something that you can admire
 Hypothesis
 The person you admire has a certain ability
 You also want to have
 So they became idols to be imitated
 This is part of the reason why people develop, just like some children often treat older children as heroes

 Not much older than them, usually within their understanding
 They will follow such children and imitate them
 They imitate people they admire
 The fact that you admire certain people or things provides clues to understanding your unrealized value system
 Even as an exercise
 What kind of human qualities I admire, you need to ask yourself
 You haven’t really considered this, there is a clear difference between asking yourself questions and thinking about them
 Because when you ask yourself a question, you think
 What do I find about admiration?
 You don't know the problem
 If you are lucky, this will happen regularly, and the answers may often be wild
 You can write it down
 You have some ideas about what your ideals, you know, and maybe you already have a
 Your ideal match is a star

 When you make a wish to the starry sky, you look up at the starry sky
 The spirit gathers on something beyond yourself
 Focus on the starry sky shining in the dark night
 Now the stars mean
 People who wear jewelry, because jewelry is like stars
 Or like the sun
 Pure and perfect and shining,
 So some matter about the source of light
 This is the source of enlightenment and illumination
 So the light shining in the night sky is a very deep metaphor
 This is what you want, you want light to shine in the dark night
 The stars have all these characteristics, so people make wishes for the stars
 Because they have some intuition that can surpass the ordinary
 Has the potential to reshape, they make a wish
 When you want to make a wish
 You should set high goals!
 Even just like wishing a wish come true
 This is not a metaphor
 You know that I have a plan, you all will color jade
 Called the future writing plan
 This is one of two assignments, one of which is writing an autobiography
 This is writing about the past, the other is writing about planning for the future
 Called Future Writing, I suggest you start preparing immediately
 Not right away, but start very quickly, because it’s harder than you think
 Some of you will write about 15,000 words
 You will find yourself writing poorly, this always happens

 So you write an autobiography to find out where you are from
 Who are you or how do you plan for the future unless you know where you are from
 Then you have to write the future by hand because
 When you don't have a goal, you don't have focus
 Definitely
 Most of the time people don’t focus on the goal because they are afraid
 The reason for fear is that when you know what to do, you also know the conditions for failure
 You know when you fail
 It’s better to continue to feel fuzzy, like I don’t know if I succeeded or failed
 This is difficult to describe in detail. well! Except when you don’t focus on the target you can’t get
 So the future writing plan is like
 Make you have to clearly try to describe yourself
 So who are you in the past writing plan?
 Past writing plans required breaking down your life into multiple periods
 Write down things about emotions, that is, some important events
 These events shape who you are
 You will find that writing like this will make you emotional
 If you have more than 18 months of memory, generally speaking
 When you remember it again, there will be an emotional shock
 Especially negative emotional shock
 Just like part of your soul goes back and gets stuck there
 This is a figurative way of thinking, I mean
 Now you can still feel emotional because you still have not solved the problem in this situation
 Face it, maybe this is the crux that some people still struggle with when you face it
 These people are bad, it’s very difficult, because you have to deal with the problem of evil
 Similar questions, this is no joke
 If this still generates emotions, you have not solved the problem
 Your brain still sees it as a threat, this is an area you have not mastered
 Threat, threat, threat
 Knowing you knock it down, expression is a useful way, writing is a useful way
 The place where you are threatened will not let you free
 It feels unpleasant, when you deal with these situations
 In the short term will tend to produce emotional decline
 But it was back to normal after about 3-6 months
 Unfortunately, people often face this situation and must not do what they don’t want to do
 This is very common
 So the future writing plan asks you to thank you for the different dimensions of your life
 Because you can see yourself as the personality in your head
 You are embedded in a system that transcends you, as real as any thought that appears in your mind
 What you need in your life
 This is easy to answer, some friends
 Intimacy, family, are good things
 No matter what will happen or what you already have,
 To some extent, from these things, people feel love and care for each other, which is also a good thing
 You need a career plan, you need to find a position to make others value it and treat you equally
 You can live
 When you are not at work, you need to use the time to do something worthwhile
 You also need to pay attention to your physical and mental health
 Need to adjust and plan your asset use
 This is one of the weird points, because a lot of people drink, so it’s worth thinking about, and that’s why we put it forward
 The next question, what do you want?
 What do you want from your friends
 What to get from your family
 What you get from your career
 If you can get what you want, this is the question this plan asks you
 After about 3-5 years of planned life, you can get what you want
 I assume that your goals or expectations are like a sane adult
 Instead of being like a 13-year-old dreamer, I want the most expensive yacht in the world
 This is OK, but,
 This does not focus on the original intention of the writing plan, allowing you to focus more on your character
 Then you are asked to write for 15 minutes, almost without thinking, without considering issues such as grammar or sentence structure

 About your life in the next 3-5 years
 If you care about yourself
 You will help (future self) imagine what he needs
 Then the plan requires you to do the same thing in the opposite way
 After rational consideration of various situations
 Your shortcomings
 I guess everyone knows
 But everyone has the intuition to reduce their shortcomings

 Some people are addicted to alcohol, some are on the streets
 Certainly something fatal happened to produce this result
 If you are particularly careless
 Don't let things fall apart and fall apart
 So hope you write it down
 About what you don’t want to happen in the next 3-5 years
 This has a psychological basis
 If you have goals, this is the source of positive emotions
 Because there is evidence that positive emotions usually come from when you are close to something that makes you valuable
 Only completing certain plans cannot generate excessive positive emotions
 Because when you finish something, you leave the problem that you will face next time
 When you graduate from university
 Yay!
 You cannot graduate from university one day,
 Then you will be unemployed, looking for a bad job like Starbucks

 You understand what i mean
 The problems you need to solve one after another
 If you keep thinking that you will be happy when all the problems are solved
 Hahaha! good luck
 but
 When you work towards something worthwhile, you believe it is worth it
 You thought about it, you know, so you won’t be weak, because you cheer yourself up
 Then when some progress is made, even if only a little bit, you think, hey, not bad,
 You will release a small dose of dopamine
 This makes what you want, this is the source of your positive emotions
 Cocaine can also achieve this effect, but
 This is bad for you in the long run

 But confirm that the same system is activated, so you must have goals
 You should set realistic goals

 you want
 And you can get it, maybe not so easy
 If it’s simple, in a sense you already have it
 This goal must push you forward, which is actually very fun
 When you pursue an important goal, you want to do two things
 One of them is to get this important thing
 The other thing is that you become better in the pursuit
 Yes
 You can get both things at the same time
 You have goals and at the same time increase your satisfaction with yourself
 This is a very good deal
 There are a lot of essential meanings in it, so the second plan

 You write down your plan
 On how to reach the goal and if not derail
 You will also write down why this is good for you
 Why is it good for your family
 What might be beneficial to the community
 Because you want to fix this
 You have to think about the difficulties you may encounter and possible ways to overcome them in advance
 And how to stay on track, all these
 Because we have done a lot of research on this plan

 When college students participate, they have a better start than those who don’t.

 When college students participate in the program, about 25% will not withdraw
 This number is pretty good
 Their average academic performance has increased by about 20%

 Not bad because you never know what obstacles you will encounter when you work
 There are positive feelings, but not from my laboratory
 Doing these things is good for your health
 I think the reason may be when you look back on your autobiography
 The negative emotions that have been following you can be washed away
 Reduces your overall stress
 Your brain calculates how dangerous the world is based on the ratio of success and failure in your life so far

 Mechanism like this
 Just like there are still holes on your map, you will fall into it
 Your brain will still see it as a dangerous area
 You prepare more for emergency actions, which is difficult
 You want to go back in time and fix these experiences


 These will simultaneously change the current ratio
 It’s complicated, but that’s what you do
 Write down what you have to write

 Everything that makes you uncomfortable
 Share with others
 There are several reasons for doing this
 One of them is that there is no other way

 If i wanna do it with you
 The grading load will be very high
 But I think it is still worth doing, because this class is about narration and self-narration, so it should be done
 Many of you will graduate soon
 This is also helpful, it should be very helpful, this is from the student report


 3 people will rate your homework and score, and then take the average of the two with the highest score

 This will give you constructive feedback
 Constructive feedback tends to support what you are doing right
 Maybe some tips are about which piece you can enrich
 That's it, you need to write a paper
 The details are explained on the website
 This is the website, click on this website, the class is on the left
 Click on the class and you will see a bunch of tabs, one of which is Spirit 434, which is obviously this class
 The extracurricular reading content is also listed here
 And how do you pass this course
 The date is not accurate, I have updated it but not yet finished
 But everything else can be used
 This writing plan is an online plan, it will know how you do it
 But I sincerely suggest that you start this week

 because
 When you spend more time, the result will be better
 Like a writing explosion
 During the intermission period, it is your brain’s way to consolidate new knowledge
 Think carefully to do this
 Ask yourself
 This is a different way
 It’s fun when you ask yourself questions, because part of you will answer
 And you don't know what the answer will be
 But the answer will always appear
 When I was about 6 years old I would ask myself questions, which is very important

 Through some mysterious steps, memories will come to mind

 Course has exam
 So there are two assignments plus a paper

 The thesis can be
 Any questions you want to discuss related to the course

 Must be related to the course

 This is what you wrote
 Some chance to write something
 Finally there is an exam, the final exam
 If you read the book and come in every class, there is no problem passing the exam
 Because the exam is not complicated
 Just a questionnaire of what you experienced
 I did not do it at the beginning of the course
 Because you need carrots and sticks because you are busy
 You will also classify
 Do key things, maybe some people can’t grasp the point, there will be such a result
 I take this as the key or you won’t read it
 Part of the reason is because it is difficult
 Because the lecture notes can help you pass
 This is about the course
 Then we tell you some stories and try to explain its meaning
 What i hope happens is
 The narrative world opens the door to you
 This is useful,
 Got it
 These questions will make you adapt better
 Can also help you, usually people tell me about this course

 Like telling something you already know
 But they don't know they know
 This makes sense, this wakes you up
 You already have information on your behalf
 In your actions
 In process
 In the structure of your intuition, this is implicit

 I can make it clear what some of the hints about you are
 This is what I do and it is what people usually do

 If any of you experience this feeling in this class, it’s a good sign,
 You may benefit from the course
 If not, try again to see what happens
 This is what will happen in this course
 If this is what you want, from this course you can get
 It’s nice to meet everyone, this class ends here
