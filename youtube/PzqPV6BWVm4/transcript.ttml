<p begin="00:02:23.200" end="00:02:29.410" style="s2">instance your groveling but thank you</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.730" end="00:02:32.320" style="s2">Brian for breaking new territory and I</p>

<p begin="00:02:32.320" end="00:02:37.870" style="s2">first of all I want to say that I so</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.010" end="00:02:40.090" style="s2">love your conversational style that</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.870" end="00:02:42.820" style="s2">anytime you start hosting this feel free</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.090" end="00:02:44.410" style="s2">but we&#39;re just we&#39;re just beginning the</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.820" end="00:02:46.000" style="s2">portal and what we&#39;re trying to do with</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.410" end="00:02:48.010" style="s2">with the show in the series is two</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.000" end="00:02:50.770" style="s2">separate things one I think we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.010" end="00:02:53.530" style="s2">have a great time being here and</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.770" end="00:02:57.160" style="s2">interviewing lots of interesting people</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.530" end="00:02:58.510" style="s2">but there&#39;s a sort of a theme running</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.160" end="00:03:01.090" style="s2">through it which is that I think a lot</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.510" end="00:03:03.340" style="s2">of people have realized that we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.090" end="00:03:05.770" style="s2">in some kind of a stasis and that some</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.340" end="00:03:08.320" style="s2">of us may have found ways to break out</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.770" end="00:03:10.690" style="s2">of whatever this kind of malaise or</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.320" end="00:03:13.390" style="s2">miasma that settled over the country is</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.690" end="00:03:16.270" style="s2">and we&#39;re trying to find the people and</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.390" end="00:03:18.489" style="s2">the concepts that might give people some</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.270" end="00:03:20.680" style="s2">some new options to think about how to</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.489" end="00:03:22.420" style="s2">break free of whatever might be holding</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.680" end="00:03:23.830" style="s2">them in place or their communities or</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.420" end="00:03:26.380" style="s2">the country even so at all different</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.830" end="00:03:28.390" style="s2">levels and scales one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.380" end="00:03:32.310" style="s2">has been most impressive to me about you</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.390" end="00:03:37.000" style="s2">is the way you use certain techniques</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.310" end="00:03:39.239" style="s2">for breaking new ground socially and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.000" end="00:03:42.370" style="s2">was just thinking recently I happen to</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.239" end="00:03:46.380" style="s2">be invited over to your place and you</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.370" end="00:03:50.920" style="s2">had a group of very talented combat</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.380" end="00:03:52.360" style="s2">sports guys just an eclectic group it</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.920" end="00:03:54.280" style="s2">was the collective group but it was but</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.360" end="00:03:57.250" style="s2">there was a common theme and the common</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.280" end="00:03:59.920" style="s2">theme seemed to be people who were very</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.250" end="00:04:04.330" style="s2">skilled in a ring or in combat like</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.920" end="00:04:06.519" style="s2">situations and it struck me that it was</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.330" end="00:04:09.579" style="s2">also incredibly diverse that in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.519" end="00:04:11.620" style="s2">a diversity standard other than than the</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.579" end="00:04:13.299" style="s2">gendered issue it was people of</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.620" end="00:04:14.620" style="s2">different hues different religions</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.299" end="00:04:17.470" style="s2">different cultural backgrounds different</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.620" end="00:04:19.269" style="s2">age groups and it was one of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.470" end="00:04:21.340" style="s2">greatest salons and dinners I&#39;ve been to</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.269" end="00:04:24.190" style="s2">in a long time and it consisted largely</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.340" end="00:04:25.520" style="s2">of as the British say people taking the</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.190" end="00:04:29.270" style="s2">piss out of each other</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.520" end="00:04:30.949" style="s2">yeah and as a result the intimacy in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.270" end="00:04:32.300" style="s2">room was off-the-charts people were</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.949" end="00:04:35.090" style="s2">really opening up people were being</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.300" end="00:04:37.130" style="s2">vulnerable people were actually building</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.090" end="00:04:39.740" style="s2">each other up and somehow there is no</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.130" end="00:04:41.389" style="s2">explanation for this behavior in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.740" end="00:04:44.300" style="s2">current cultural moment it&#39;s like we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.389" end="00:04:46.490" style="s2">forgotten what this is can you say a</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.300" end="00:04:49.120" style="s2">little bit about what you think is going</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.490" end="00:04:51.710" style="s2">on well first of all I think that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.120" end="00:04:53.840" style="s2">unfortunately most people don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.710" end="00:04:55.970" style="s2">they can make a difference with their</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.840" end="00:04:58.639" style="s2">ideas with their conversation with their</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.970" end="00:05:00.889" style="s2">point of view with their actions they</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.639" end="00:05:04.130" style="s2">you know that that&#39;s that&#39;s a cynicism</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.889" end="00:05:05.569" style="s2">it&#39;s a deep cynicism that seems to and</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.130" end="00:05:06.919" style="s2">I&#39;ve always been an optimist and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.569" end="00:05:10.580" style="s2">always thought if you look at history</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.919" end="00:05:15.979" style="s2">it&#39;s usually a small group of people</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.580" end="00:05:17.870" style="s2">with with a with a passionate set of</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.979" end="00:05:19.789" style="s2">ideas that get things moving I mean</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.870" end="00:05:22.880" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s not for the good in my</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.789" end="00:05:25.060" style="s2">opinion for example Russia in 1914 I</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.880" end="00:05:28.099" style="s2">mean a very small group of intellectuals</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.060" end="00:05:29.780" style="s2">who got the Communist revolution started</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.099" end="00:05:31.580" style="s2">I might have been part of that back then</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.780" end="00:05:33.469" style="s2">if you looked at the way you know Russia</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.580" end="00:05:35.090" style="s2">was but these are people that had the</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.469" end="00:05:36.289" style="s2">gumption and the I mean if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.090" end="00:05:38.930" style="s2">the abolitionist movement it was really</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.289" end="00:05:41.000" style="s2">started in in England and I think in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.930" end="00:05:43.400" style="s2">1840s it started but it was about these</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.000" end="00:05:45.680" style="s2">sort of like evangelical Christians who</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.400" end="00:05:47.030" style="s2">said look you know no matter what we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.680" end="00:05:49.400" style="s2">do this if you look even in this country</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.030" end="00:05:51.560" style="s2">John Brown these were fanatics but they</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.400" end="00:05:54.349" style="s2">were a small energized group of people</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.560" end="00:05:58.130" style="s2">the Quakers they set these examples you</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.349" end="00:06:00.680" style="s2">can even go into you know if you look</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.130" end="00:06:03.409" style="s2">think about the ramifications of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.680" end="00:06:08.090" style="s2">marriage between I think was even sowed</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.409" end="00:06:10.009" style="s2">and maja and Wahab the marriage of those</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.090" end="00:06:11.960" style="s2">kids and he&#39;d they made a deal and he</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.009" end="00:06:14.990" style="s2">said let me preach let me preach my</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.960" end="00:06:16.789" style="s2">puritanical Salafi Islam my my</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.990" end="00:06:19.099" style="s2">puritanical version of Wahhabi Islam</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.789" end="00:06:21.800" style="s2">this is back in the 1700 this wasn&#39;t so</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.099" end="00:06:26.509" style="s2">well did they met I think in 1744 but</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.800" end="00:06:28.370" style="s2">you know Italy so this was a small group</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.509" end="00:06:30.289" style="s2">of very energetic people now I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.370" end="00:06:32.180" style="s2">think a lot of times the outcome is so</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.289" end="00:06:35.750" style="s2">positive and those in those instances</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.180" end="00:06:37.250" style="s2">but I for better for worse I think the</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.750" end="00:06:39.350" style="s2">way you beat a bad idea is with a better</p>

<p begin="00:10:52.890" end="00:10:57.340" style="s2">relationship where I get so much from</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.120" end="00:10:59.980" style="s2">him and so much wisdom and he gets so</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.340" end="00:11:01.890" style="s2">much from me now I&#39;m also 20 years older</p>

<p begin="00:11:04.420" end="00:11:07.450" style="s2">there so I</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.800" end="00:11:08.470" style="s2">if I&#39;m answering your crash question we</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.450" end="00:11:10.390" style="s2">know you&#39;re actually getting to another</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.470" end="00:11:12.339" style="s2">topic which I&#39;m fascinated by you can</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.390" end="00:11:17.080" style="s2">continue the river I can jump no please</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.339" end="00:11:19.750" style="s2">so there&#39;s a there&#39;s a I don&#39;t underst a</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.080" end="00:11:21.339" style="s2">degree but kind of a pattern that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.750" end="00:11:23.560" style="s2">noticed I haven&#39;t heard much commented</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.339" end="00:11:27.339" style="s2">upon which is that social interactions</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.560" end="00:11:29.860" style="s2">get really rich when people can pass</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.339" end="00:11:32.890" style="s2">power back and forth in other words if</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.860" end="00:11:34.930" style="s2">you have some kind of power and you and</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.890" end="00:11:37.750" style="s2">you sit on it it&#39;s not nearly as</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.930" end="00:11:40.510" style="s2">powerful as if I somehow give it away to</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.750" end="00:11:43.480" style="s2">you and you give it back to me so for</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.510" end="00:11:45.640" style="s2">example if you look at a happy couple</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.480" end="00:11:47.560" style="s2">maybe the man praises his wife to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.640" end="00:11:52.570" style="s2">hill talks about how he married up etc</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.560" end="00:11:55.079" style="s2">etc and in return you know she she talks</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.570" end="00:11:57.550" style="s2">about how you know what an honor it is</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.079" end="00:12:00.100" style="s2">being with a man she can look up to and</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.550" end="00:12:03.339" style="s2">the idea is that they&#39;ve both exchanged</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.100" end="00:12:05.290" style="s2">power and build something in the dyad</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.339" end="00:12:06.820" style="s2">but okay that&#39;s a very important that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.290" end="00:12:08.740" style="s2">and that&#39;s a very important idea at the</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.820" end="00:12:10.180" style="s2">crux of why I put all these people from</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.740" end="00:12:12.640" style="s2">different Oaks together right very</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.180" end="00:12:14.350" style="s2">similar so so one person has 100 million</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.640" end="00:12:17.020" style="s2">dollars the other person is having</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.350" end="00:12:18.730" style="s2">trouble making rent what I like about</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.020" end="00:12:23.380" style="s2">putting all those people together that</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.730" end="00:12:25.630" style="s2">are so different is that yes yes Eric</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.380" end="00:12:28.630" style="s2">you might be smarter at theoretical math</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.630" end="00:12:31.000" style="s2">but you have deficits too we all do</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.630" end="00:12:33.070" style="s2">we all do so you&#39;re you may be a</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.000" end="00:12:35.589" style="s2">superstar over here yes mala can knock</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.070" end="00:12:38.110" style="s2">me out with a right hand but that is</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.589" end="00:12:42.640" style="s2">relevant only when we&#39;re in the ring</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.110" end="00:12:44.980" style="s2">right right it&#39;s a little bit like so so</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.640" end="00:12:46.899" style="s2">all of us have these deficits all of us</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.980" end="00:12:47.500" style="s2">have these weaknesses where are you</p>

<p begin="00:17:02.710" end="00:17:08.050" style="s2">11 or 12 days I got and then we did a</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.920" end="00:17:12.070" style="s2">simulation a firefight with you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.050" end="00:17:12.670" style="s2">lasers and stuff and I I could feel that</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.070" end="00:17:15.970" style="s2">adrenaline</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.670" end="00:17:17.920" style="s2">I was I was jonesing for it for a long</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.970" end="00:17:19.780" style="s2">time afterwards and so was my friend we</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.920" end="00:17:21.310" style="s2">talked about it you know I can&#39;t imagine</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.780" end="00:17:26.110" style="s2">going through a real firefight you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.310" end="00:17:27.280" style="s2">pgo work that he I wish and I think it</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.110" end="00:17:30.340" style="s2">may have been Tennyson that he was</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.280" end="00:17:32.140" style="s2">actually referencing but he he said we</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.340" end="00:17:33.850" style="s2">used to discuss the drunk delight of</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.140" end="00:17:37.060" style="s2">battle before we decided that war was a</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.850" end="00:17:38.920" style="s2">bad thing and you know I&#39;m on record of</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.060" end="00:17:40.090" style="s2">saying that I like everything about war</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.920" end="00:17:43.090" style="s2">except for the death and destruction</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.090" end="00:17:44.610" style="s2">that in some sense you need life and</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.090" end="00:17:47.910" style="s2">death</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.610" end="00:17:49.680" style="s2">risk at least to catalyze certain things</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.910" end="00:17:52.620" style="s2">and then there&#39;s a question about does</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.680" end="00:17:54.870" style="s2">the life and death risk need to involve</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.620" end="00:17:56.640" style="s2">conflict between people and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.870" end="00:17:58.770" style="s2">things I&#39;m curious about is the</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.640" end="00:18:01.170" style="s2">structure of the buddy picture which is</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.770" end="00:18:03.780" style="s2">a Hollywood staple and in the buddy</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.170" end="00:18:06.750" style="s2">picture you have to establish the two</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.780" end="00:18:07.800" style="s2">people really detest each other and then</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.750" end="00:18:10.350" style="s2">they have to go through some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.800" end="00:18:12.690" style="s2">transformational conflict and only then</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.350" end="00:18:14.670" style="s2">do they realize that they both have sort</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.690" end="00:18:16.650" style="s2">of a complementarity</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.670" end="00:18:18.720" style="s2">that allows them to be truly close</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.650" end="00:18:20.730" style="s2">that&#39;s right look what happens to guys</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.720" end="00:18:22.740" style="s2">who who hate each other before a fight</p>

<p begin="00:18:46.710" end="00:18:50.610" style="s2">well it wasn&#39;t even a fight it was a</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.390" end="00:18:53.400" style="s2">surprise attack yeah that&#39;s where hey</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.610" end="00:18:55.530" style="s2">Maz Vito that&#39;s that&#39;s you can&#39;t talk</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.400" end="00:18:57.030" style="s2">trash to hurt him out of it all for</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.530" end="00:18:59.220" style="s2">three weeks before the fight the way</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.030" end="00:19:01.230" style="s2">Askren does and then expect him not to</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.220" end="00:19:04.380" style="s2">showboat a little bit you can&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.230" end="00:19:07.050" style="s2">to Jorge Jorge Masvidal that&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.380" end="00:19:08.610" style="s2">fight and he he still doesn&#39;t like it</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.050" end="00:19:10.020" style="s2">like he said he goes if I see him in a</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.610" end="00:19:12.390" style="s2">supermarket he might get slapped up cuz</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.020" end="00:19:15.140" style="s2">I don&#39;t like yeah look so this is the</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.390" end="00:19:17.340" style="s2">issue that some fights are</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.140" end="00:19:19.650" style="s2">transformational and they produce a</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.340" end="00:19:22.680" style="s2">closeness and some fights don&#39;t resolve</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.650" end="00:19:26.220" style="s2">whatever the tension is and so one of</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.680" end="00:19:28.560" style="s2">the things I&#39;m super curious about is is</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.220" end="00:19:32.790" style="s2">it your experience like if I think about</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.560" end="00:19:36.540" style="s2">the fistfights I got in growing up I</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.790" end="00:19:38.250" style="s2">would say that I ended up closer to</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.540" end="00:19:44.340" style="s2">about half of the people that I fought</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.250" end="00:19:45.870" style="s2">and it had to do with some intangible</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.340" end="00:19:48.360" style="s2">ineffable quality I can&#39;t quite put my</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.870" end="00:19:49.650" style="s2">finger on can you say when it is that</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.360" end="00:19:52.190" style="s2">you find that a fight can be</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.650" end="00:19:56.060" style="s2">transformational in male intimacy I</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.190" end="00:19:58.110" style="s2">don&#39;t know I think I think it I think</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.060" end="00:20:01.920" style="s2">look I mean</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.110" end="00:20:04.410" style="s2">we are fighting is the purest of sport</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.920" end="00:20:05.790" style="s2">in a way I mean what is football it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.410" end="00:20:07.980" style="s2">game of inches yes but it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.790" end="00:20:09.960" style="s2">simulated war well it&#39;s like multiple</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.980" end="00:20:10.410" style="s2">layers of indirection from war that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.960" end="00:20:12.600" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.410" end="00:20:14.430" style="s2">basketball baseball these are even more</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.600" end="00:20:15.720" style="s2">these are very I mean the competition is</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.430" end="00:20:17.370" style="s2">very heated these guys are giving it</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.720" end="00:20:20.160" style="s2">their all</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.370" end="00:20:22.770" style="s2">there&#39;s something about fighting where</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.160" end="00:20:25.050" style="s2">especially when it&#39;s MMA or something</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.770" end="00:20:27.270" style="s2">but for that matter really boxing I</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.050" end="00:20:31.080" style="s2">think where you where you&#39;re coming as</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.270" end="00:20:34.710" style="s2">close as you can get almost to what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.080" end="00:20:37.260" style="s2">like to see a man kill another man or a</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.710" end="00:20:39.720" style="s2">woman nowadays kill another woman with</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.260" end="00:20:41.220" style="s2">their bare hands there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.720" end="00:20:44.820" style="s2">probably more deol to that that brings</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.220" end="00:20:47.520" style="s2">us back to when we were you know when we</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.820" end="00:20:49.080" style="s2">first evolved you know well so we talked</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.520" end="00:20:51.570" style="s2">sometimes about the chomskyan pre</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.080" end="00:20:53.280" style="s2">grammar of language and I&#39;ve in other</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.570" end="00:20:56.040" style="s2">places talked about the is there a</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.280" end="00:20:58.110" style="s2">Chomsky and pre grammar of religion and</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.040" end="00:21:01.290" style="s2">is there a Chomsky and pre grammar of</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.110" end="00:21:03.510" style="s2">violence where whether we&#39;ve we I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.290" end="00:21:06.720" style="s2">we were probably communicating way</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.510" end="00:21:09.000" style="s2">before we developed language well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.720" end="00:21:11.040" style="s2">I mean I can I can there are parts of</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.000" end="00:21:14.820" style="s2">the world I know I can get in a fight</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.040" end="00:21:17.940" style="s2">right away just just by holding a stare</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.820" end="00:21:20.310" style="s2">and the way I&#39;m standing I promise I can</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.940" end="00:21:21.570" style="s2">get a go what&#39;s you got a problem you</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.310" end="00:21:23.340" style="s2">want to get a fight really very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.570" end="00:21:25.260" style="s2">I&#39;ll take you down I&#39;ll take you to</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.340" end="00:21:27.150" style="s2">Brooklyn I&#39;ll take it along Island I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.260" end="00:21:28.020" style="s2">take you to I&#39;ll take it up anywhere in</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.150" end="00:21:29.820" style="s2">Boston or Philly</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.020" end="00:21:33.270" style="s2">I promise for that matter Jersey right</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.820" end="00:21:35.550" style="s2">and and by the way not necessarily in LA</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.270" end="00:21:38.070" style="s2">but let me take it at the Inland Empire</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.550" end="00:21:38.370" style="s2">yeah just stand and stare for a little</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.070" end="00:21:40.620" style="s2">bit</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.370" end="00:21:43.710" style="s2">whereas posture up something&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.620" end="00:21:47.190" style="s2">happen you know so we are very aware I</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.710" end="00:21:49.290" style="s2">think we have antenna that has been have</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.190" end="00:21:53.070" style="s2">been developed over millennia for when</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.290" end="00:21:55.170" style="s2">somebody&#39;s trying to take what&#39;s ours</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.070" end="00:21:57.390" style="s2">I always say this about I&#39;m writing</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.170" end="00:21:59.130" style="s2">about vulnerability yeah I&#39;m writing</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.390" end="00:22:00.600" style="s2">about what it what you know men are</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.130" end="00:22:02.610" style="s2">supposed to be vulnerable and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.600" end="00:22:05.550" style="s2">supposed to sit with our sad and cry and</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.610" end="00:22:07.680" style="s2">get in touch with all okay all right man</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.550" end="00:22:10.320" style="s2">but I&#39;m feeling point I&#39;m dealing with a</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.680" end="00:22:11.940" style="s2">lot of his genetic residue for a long</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.320" end="00:22:14.669" style="s2">time you know ahead</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.940" end="00:22:17.730" style="s2">hunt yeah you know what&#39;s with a spear</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.669" end="00:22:19.980" style="s2">or whatever and I had to you know III</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.730" end="00:22:22.409" style="s2">have to believe that a lot of this is</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.980" end="00:22:25.889" style="s2">wired and and if you think of what it</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.409" end="00:22:28.679" style="s2">was to be a human being in most cases</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.889" end="00:22:30.389" style="s2">throughout our history whether we were</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.679" end="00:22:33.509" style="s2">in a small village of if you were in a</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.389" end="00:22:34.379" style="s2">vulnerable if you were in a well forget</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.509" end="00:22:37.049" style="s2">for that matter you could have been in</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.379" end="00:22:39.299" style="s2">Baghdad in 1258 and the Mongols are</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.049" end="00:22:41.549" style="s2">Constantinople and what was it fourteen</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.299" end="00:22:44.789" style="s2">something when the d ottomans broke down</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.549" end="00:22:46.620" style="s2">the wall did our history has been here</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.789" end="00:22:48.240" style="s2">they come over the hill they&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.620" end="00:22:50.759" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna break down our walls and</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.240" end="00:22:52.620" style="s2">kill us and take our women and children</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.759" end="00:22:54.840" style="s2">as slaves right that&#39;s the story of</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.620" end="00:22:57.330" style="s2">history you know if you&#39;ll forgive me if</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.840" end="00:22:59.519" style="s2">I&#39;m not a little bit ready all the time</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.330" end="00:23:02.879" style="s2">to fight for my life what so so this is</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.519" end="00:23:04.409" style="s2">boy am I glad we&#39;re we&#39;re here sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.879" end="00:23:06.629" style="s2">I think about the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.409" end="00:23:09.000" style="s2">vulnerability has to be earned through</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.629" end="00:23:11.879" style="s2">strength so for example if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.000" end="00:23:14.970" style="s2">Vin Diesel if he&#39;s wearing a feather boa</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.879" end="00:23:17.429" style="s2">it&#39;s only because he&#39;s Vin Diesel he</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.970" end="00:23:19.470" style="s2">can&#39;t wear a feather boa if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.429" end="00:23:21.629" style="s2">really good you gotta have another man&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.470" end="00:23:25.309" style="s2">blood on the on the fence well you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.629" end="00:23:29.460" style="s2">or you know if you ever saw what was it</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.309" end="00:23:31.500" style="s2">with Tim Roth is this swordsman and</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.460" end="00:23:34.409" style="s2">there&#39;s a great duel in the end is it</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.500" end="00:23:36.990" style="s2">Rob Roy and he&#39;s like he&#39;s he&#39;s he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.409" end="00:23:39.419" style="s2">there with his like Philly cuffs and</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.990" end="00:23:40.769" style="s2">thing but he&#39;s got better sword sword</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.419" end="00:23:43.019" style="s2">ability than anybody and he&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.769" end="00:23:45.570" style="s2">completely deadly yeah and so in some</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.019" end="00:23:48.029" style="s2">weird way in order to be comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.570" end="00:23:51.299" style="s2">with that vulnerability you actually it</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.029" end="00:23:54.840" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like the desert that comes</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.299" end="00:23:56.909" style="s2">from having proven yourself as somebody</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.840" end="00:24:00.029" style="s2">to be not to be trifled well I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.909" end="00:24:02.970" style="s2">that it&#39;s an interesting thing because</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.029" end="00:24:04.740" style="s2">when you really study the language of</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.970" end="00:24:07.169" style="s2">vulnerability the dog and the fighters</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.740" end="00:24:11.820" style="s2">that you know I&#39;ve know enough combat</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.169" end="00:24:13.259" style="s2">Navy SEALs and these guys I think they</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.820" end="00:24:15.629" style="s2">have a real sense of their own mortality</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.259" end="00:24:17.429" style="s2">I mean because they&#39;ve either had to</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.629" end="00:24:20.100" style="s2">take lives or they&#39;ve seen their friend</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.429" end="00:24:23.340" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s so it happens so quickly so</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.100" end="00:24:25.110" style="s2">it&#39;s a combination of they become</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.340" end="00:24:25.650" style="s2">vulnerable but they don&#39;t sweat the</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.110" end="00:24:27.260" style="s2">small stuff</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.650" end="00:24:29.940" style="s2">a lot of this politically correct</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.260" end="00:24:31.770" style="s2">insanity about you said this word and</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.940" end="00:24:33.630" style="s2">that makes you a racist or whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.770" end="00:24:37.320" style="s2">is we&#39;re just we&#39;re so offended all the</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.630" end="00:24:39.390" style="s2">time most of those people it goes back</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.320" end="00:24:43.020" style="s2">to what you were saying we don&#39;t have an</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.390" end="00:24:45.180" style="s2">existential threat anymore and so most</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.020" end="00:24:47.310" style="s2">of those people don&#39;t really know and</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.180" end="00:24:48.870" style="s2">haven&#39;t really suffered because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.310" end="00:24:51.390" style="s2">mostly white they haven&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.870" end="00:24:54.600" style="s2">suffered this this egregious racism /</p>

<p begin="00:24:54.600" end="00:25:00.930" style="s2">he I listened to him talk and stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.450" end="00:25:03.690" style="s2">I mean Ezra is so painfully educated and</p>

<p begin="00:26:39.090" end="00:26:45.600" style="s2">something I&#39;d be super interested in</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.440" end="00:26:47.400" style="s2">developing it for a while we started we</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.600" end="00:26:50.310" style="s2">started hearing comedians saying I won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.400" end="00:26:53.580" style="s2">play colleges anymore yeah that colleges</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.310" end="00:26:55.080" style="s2">become unfun it throws me off my comedy</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.580" end="00:26:56.340" style="s2">game it&#39;s not something I want to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.080" end="00:26:58.590" style="s2">doing because people are so easily</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.340" end="00:27:00.540" style="s2">offended and part of the function of</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.590" end="00:27:02.460" style="s2">comedy was to explore that which is</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.540" end="00:27:04.620" style="s2">offensive and to give people access</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.460" end="00:27:06.870" style="s2">where normally they would sort of block</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.620" end="00:27:09.200" style="s2">it off and not be able to do it and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.870" end="00:27:11.100" style="s2">Joe Rogan our mutual friend said</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.200" end="00:27:13.380" style="s2">something interesting to me he said it</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.100" end="00:27:13.770" style="s2">is now the Golden Age of comedy I said</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.380" end="00:27:15.810" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.770" end="00:27:18.360" style="s2">and he said well we&#39;ve started figuring</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.810" end="00:27:19.890" style="s2">out how to tell these jokes after a</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.360" end="00:27:22.710" style="s2">period where we couldn&#39;t figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.890" end="00:27:25.590" style="s2">had gone wrong and the best people are</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.710" end="00:27:27.720" style="s2">now able to explore these things because</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.590" end="00:27:29.160" style="s2">some new skill level had been unlocked</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.720" end="00:27:31.530" style="s2">does that resonate with you as a</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.160" end="00:27:33.090" style="s2">stand-up I don&#39;t know it&#39;s just saying</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.530" end="00:27:35.490" style="s2">it I was thinking huh that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.090" end="00:27:37.290" style="s2">interesting thing it&#39;s certainly way</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.490" end="00:27:39.540" style="s2">more lucrative now and it&#39;s easier to</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.290" end="00:27:44.550" style="s2">reach a wider audience and also your own</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.540" end="00:27:45.630" style="s2">audience so you know you can niche so</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.550" end="00:27:47.940" style="s2">you and Joe might have different</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.630" end="00:27:49.530" style="s2">audiences well well we may have the same</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.940" end="00:27:52.440" style="s2">I don&#39;t know but we probably have a</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.530" end="00:27:55.050" style="s2">similar audience but I think it&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.440" end="00:27:57.840" style="s2">easier to find your niche and so that</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.050" end="00:27:59.880" style="s2">can be a little bit deceptive okay right</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.840" end="00:28:00.720" style="s2">so I don&#39;t know the answer he might be</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.880" end="00:28:02.520" style="s2">right about that</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.720" end="00:28:04.110" style="s2">I do think there&#39;s some great comedy out</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.520" end="00:28:06.330" style="s2">there and I think it&#39;s needed I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.110" end="00:28:08.010" style="s2">people like Bill burr and Jim Jeffries</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.330" end="00:28:11.190" style="s2">and Rogen are and are needed because</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.010" end="00:28:13.620" style="s2">they&#39;re satirist sand and it&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.190" end="00:28:16.670" style="s2">the last place on earth where you can</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.620" end="00:28:20.990" style="s2">really speak your mind and express</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.670" end="00:28:23.850" style="s2">unpopular points of view without</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.990" end="00:28:26.390" style="s2">suffering the kinds of ramifications you</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.850" end="00:28:28.740" style="s2">would if you worked at Google Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.390" end="00:28:30.990" style="s2">or the People&#39;s Republic of Apple you</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.740" end="00:28:33.510" style="s2">know wherever it might be these places</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.990" end="00:28:35.010" style="s2">are pretty tyrannical it seems I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.510" end="00:28:38.610" style="s2">know I haven&#39;t worked we mentioned bill</p>

<p begin="00:28:38.610" end="00:28:42.390" style="s2">but I did 10 to 15 minutes of stand-up</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.500" end="00:28:44.280" style="s2">that&#39;s all I&#39;ve ever done I didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.390" end="00:28:46.320" style="s2">that it was oh you&#39;re very funny it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.280" end="00:28:49.050" style="s2">very it was very terrifying and very and</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.320" end="00:28:52.760" style="s2">very fun but it was more or less</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.050" end="00:28:54.890" style="s2">impromptu one of the things that I felt</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.760" end="00:28:57.680" style="s2">as an outsider though other than that I</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.890" end="00:29:00.620" style="s2">have no experience is that when I saw</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.680" end="00:29:03.380" style="s2">bill burr talking about particularly</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.620" end="00:29:05.570" style="s2">gendered issues I felt like I was</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.380" end="00:29:08.210" style="s2">watching Alex Honnold the rock climber</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.570" end="00:29:10.610" style="s2">go up El Capitan it was so it was so</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.210" end="00:29:12.950" style="s2">fraught it was so dangerous course it</p>

<p begin="00:29:19.580" end="00:29:23.270" style="s2">like there there&#39;s a secret bar behind</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.560" end="00:29:26.570" style="s2">the comedy club we were just discussing</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.270" end="00:29:28.400" style="s2">and I was was invited back there I got a</p>

<p begin="00:29:50.900" end="00:29:56.630" style="s2">the only thing you can do with stand-up</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.000" end="00:29:58.220" style="s2">is to you know I always say write about</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.630" end="00:30:00.110" style="s2">what you&#39;re ashamed of what you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:30:15.440" end="00:30:19.490" style="s2">questions that I like to play on fears</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.420" end="00:30:23.120" style="s2">and ask questions I think that&#39;s where</p>

<p begin="00:33:34.580" end="00:33:38.450" style="s2">a little bit about where they&#39;re from or</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.350" end="00:33:40.970" style="s2">ask them some questions about what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.450" end="00:33:44.570" style="s2">like to be who they are and man oh man</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.970" end="00:33:50.000" style="s2">well the doors open and so that&#39;s why in</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.570" end="00:33:51.860" style="s2">my salons yeah I I love proving that</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.000" end="00:33:54.470" style="s2">over and over again by taking the most</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.860" end="00:33:56.960" style="s2">eclectic group I can and throwing them</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.470" end="00:34:00.919" style="s2">all together and watching all those</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.960" end="00:34:04.429" style="s2">ideas find you know I guess life and</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.919" end="00:34:07.730" style="s2">that&#39;s the secret well so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.429" end="00:34:12.829" style="s2">things that I think about in this area</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.730" end="00:34:15.169" style="s2">is how much to get this formula to work</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.829" end="00:34:17.419" style="s2">it really requires skill and there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.169" end="00:34:19.520" style="s2">old definition of a gentleman that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.419" end="00:34:21.409" style="s2">very partial to which is a gentleman as</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.520" end="00:34:26.060" style="s2">someone is a man who is never rude by</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.409" end="00:34:27.710" style="s2">accident and I think one of the problems</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.060" end="00:34:30.020" style="s2">we&#39;re having is that there are people at</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.710" end="00:34:32.869" style="s2">very different skill levels and so if</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.020" end="00:34:37.550" style="s2">you think about you know the terrifying</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.869" end="00:34:39.919" style="s2">words that one must not say that really</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.550" end="00:34:43.339" style="s2">is sort of an admonition when everyone</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.919" end="00:34:47.149" style="s2">is now broadcasting via social media or</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.339" end="00:34:49.369" style="s2">their you know podcasting or Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.149" end="00:34:52.069" style="s2">feed whatever it is that we&#39;re now</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.369" end="00:34:54.409" style="s2">frightened that people a very low skill</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.069" end="00:34:58.369" style="s2">and low experience are going to start</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.409" end="00:35:00.890" style="s2">opining at scale about things that in</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.369" end="00:35:03.980" style="s2">ways that are really destructive so for</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.890" end="00:35:06.440" style="s2">example if you think about how far we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.980" end="00:35:08.359" style="s2">come from George Carlin&#39;s observations</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.440" end="00:35:12.050" style="s2">Carlin died right before the financial</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.359" end="00:35:13.579" style="s2">crisis and you know his perspective was</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.050" end="00:35:14.960" style="s2">that there wasn&#39;t a word you can&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.579" end="00:35:16.849" style="s2">there are no bad words there are bad</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.960" end="00:35:20.240" style="s2">context they&#39;re bad people there may be</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.849" end="00:35:24.079" style="s2">bad intentions we&#39;re now in a world</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.240" end="00:35:27.050" style="s2">where Bill Maher is lectured by a guy</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.079" end="00:35:30.079" style="s2">who founds NWA as to what words he can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.050" end="00:35:32.840" style="s2">say how does how does that shake out I</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.079" end="00:35:35.510" style="s2">think that&#39;s just a bad idea that will</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.840" end="00:35:37.280" style="s2">we&#39;ll be scrapped eventually I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.510" end="00:35:39.590" style="s2">know how much damage it will do the Fed</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.280" end="00:35:43.360" style="s2">a lot of these bad ideas are repackaged</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.590" end="00:35:46.700" style="s2">and and they will cause their damage but</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.360" end="00:35:51.200" style="s2">hopefully because we have enough history</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.700" end="00:35:53.660" style="s2">to draw from hopefully they will lose</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.200" end="00:35:57.980" style="s2">their relevance I worry that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.660" end="00:36:00.560" style="s2">this there&#39;s this strange movement to go</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.980" end="00:36:02.620" style="s2">back to old-fashioned collectivism I</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.560" end="00:36:04.820" style="s2">mean this old-fashioned idea of</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.620" end="00:36:08.840" style="s2">socialism and even communism and Marxism</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.820" end="00:36:10.670" style="s2">and and I I don&#39;t know what this is</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.840" end="00:36:12.290" style="s2">these are young people who don&#39;t and as</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.670" end="00:36:13.910" style="s2">I really I look really pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.290" end="00:36:15.470" style="s2">it they don&#39;t have a command of history</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.910" end="00:36:16.880" style="s2">they don&#39;t know a lot they just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.470" end="00:36:19.730" style="s2">maybe I&#39;m just older and I&#39;ve done more</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.880" end="00:36:21.530" style="s2">living I lived in those socialist utopia</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.730" end="00:36:24.260" style="s2">ISM and and I went to those countries</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.530" end="00:36:27.590" style="s2">when they were very earnestly socialists</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.260" end="00:36:29.630" style="s2">and communists in and I&#39;m always amazed</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.590" end="00:36:31.010" style="s2">that these ideas and they come out of</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.630" end="00:36:32.540" style="s2">academia they come out of these</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.010" end="00:36:33.680" style="s2">professors and I know a lot of them and</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.540" end="00:36:37.490" style="s2">I&#39;ve arguments with them on my other</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.680" end="00:36:39.950" style="s2">podcast they they are people who just</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.490" end="00:36:41.300" style="s2">don&#39;t have a lot of it I don&#39;t care how</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.950" end="00:36:43.430" style="s2">smart you are I don&#39;t care how many</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.300" end="00:36:45.230" style="s2">books you read you my friend don&#39;t make</p>

<p begin="00:36:45.230" end="00:36:48.830" style="s2">I&#39;ve never had to make turn a profit</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.730" end="00:36:52.280" style="s2">with a real business you live behind</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.830" end="00:36:54.230" style="s2">walls in a university and those people</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.280" end="00:36:56.780" style="s2">are important but they can also be just</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.230" end="00:36:59.060" style="s2">as dangerous as somebody with no idea so</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.780" end="00:37:02.450" style="s2">it&#39;s very would you point out and just a</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.060" end="00:37:05.120" style="s2">riff off of that is that what if you</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.450" end="00:37:08.090" style="s2">have a system which effectively</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.120" end="00:37:11.090" style="s2">functions in a cult-like way which is</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.090" end="00:37:16.040" style="s2">very few people who are academics have</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.090" end="00:37:17.840" style="s2">ever left education in other words they</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.040" end="00:37:21.550" style="s2">start at kindergarten or pre-k that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.840" end="00:37:24.560" style="s2">what&#39;s going on and if you leave you are</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.550" end="00:37:26.420" style="s2">it&#39;s very suspicious if you return yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.560" end="00:37:27.800" style="s2">you can&#39;t take five years off for most</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.420" end="00:37:30.800" style="s2">people now occasionally there are</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.800" end="00:37:32.930" style="s2">exceptions but the system as a system of</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.800" end="00:37:35.030" style="s2">selective pressures is selecting</p>

<p begin="00:37:36.920" end="00:37:41.600" style="s2">environment I have talked to very smart</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.320" end="00:37:42.680" style="s2">academic all-stars people talk about</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.600" end="00:37:46.319" style="s2">them all the time without going into</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.680" end="00:37:47.609" style="s2">names and one didn&#39;t really realize</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.319" end="00:37:48.869" style="s2">they were they were trying to raise some</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.609" end="00:37:52.079" style="s2">money for something they wanted me to</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.869" end="00:37:53.789" style="s2">host and he didn&#39;t he didn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.079" end="00:37:56.369" style="s2">understand that there were agents out</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.789" end="00:37:57.839" style="s2">there that could raise sponsorship he</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.369" end="00:38:01.410" style="s2">just didn&#39;t live in an economic world</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.839" end="00:38:03.769" style="s2">but he&#39;s very happy to and we had a big</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.410" end="00:38:06.989" style="s2">argument about it he&#39;s very happy to</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.769" end="00:38:08.880" style="s2">advocate for an 80% tax rate for anybody</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.989" end="00:38:11.039" style="s2">making over a million dollars because he</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.880" end="00:38:13.259" style="s2">wants to go back to what but he thinks</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.039" end="00:38:14.910" style="s2">to Scandinavian like socialism which is</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.259" end="00:38:16.799" style="s2">wrong Scandinavia doesn&#39;t have that kind</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.910" end="00:38:21.599" style="s2">of a tax rate and so you&#39;re wrong but</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.799" end="00:38:24.269" style="s2">also this hunter-gatherer ideal okay all</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.599" end="00:38:26.189" style="s2">right you know good luck with that but</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.269" end="00:38:27.959" style="s2">you shouldn&#39;t be making economic policy</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.189" end="00:38:29.429" style="s2">you&#39;re not well so you&#39;re bringing up</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.959" end="00:38:32.459" style="s2">something which I think is terrifying</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.429" end="00:38:34.650" style="s2">what happens when the sense making</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.459" end="00:38:38.130" style="s2">professions that is the people that we</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.650" end="00:38:39.959" style="s2">deputize as our experts for taking in</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.130" end="00:38:41.699" style="s2">raw data and saying okay tell us what</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.959" end="00:38:43.739" style="s2">this means and tell us what we should do</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.699" end="00:38:47.009" style="s2">next and you find this in education you</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.739" end="00:38:49.859" style="s2">find this in let&#39;s say journalism and</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.009" end="00:38:53.849" style="s2">the the cop the sort of talking head</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.859" end="00:38:56.369" style="s2">class all of these sort of institutional</p>

<p begin="00:39:04.469" end="00:39:10.289" style="s2">we don&#39;t come up with jobs for that</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.079" end="00:39:12.539" style="s2">class that pay very well what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.289" end="00:39:14.519" style="s2">going to get is you&#39;re going to get very</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.539" end="00:39:18.949" style="s2">ideological people with very little</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.519" end="00:39:20.939" style="s2">outside experience who are imagining a</p>

<p begin="00:39:20.939" end="00:39:24.599" style="s2">beautifully but not thinking about the</p>

<p begin="00:39:24.599" end="00:39:26.909" style="s2">would take to accomplish that and</p>

<p begin="00:39:26.909" end="00:39:31.459" style="s2">to even do it to begin with there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.650" end="00:39:34.349" style="s2">idea there&#39;s that saying I love which is</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.459" end="00:39:36.779" style="s2">an idea is a very dangerous thing to</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.349" end="00:39:38.009" style="s2">have if it&#39;s the only one you have it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:39:40.289" end="00:39:48.229" style="s2">there that there is this orthodoxy this</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.390" end="00:39:51.509" style="s2">homogenous you know kind of collective</p>

<p begin="00:39:51.509" end="00:39:55.619" style="s2">places and and you&#39;re right I mean</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.189" end="00:39:58.489" style="s2">there&#39;s no room what but I have two</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.619" end="00:39:59.820" style="s2">things to say one I think I worry that</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.489" end="00:40:01.650" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.820" end="00:40:03.570" style="s2">a lot of these big companies I mean to</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.650" end="00:40:07.590" style="s2">express even a different point of view</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.570" end="00:40:09.450" style="s2">even to cite the science behind the</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.590" end="00:40:11.910" style="s2">difference between men and women will</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.450" end="00:40:14.520" style="s2">get you fire this because you fired I</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.910" end="00:40:16.890" style="s2">mean it really can affect your your your</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.520" end="00:40:20.520" style="s2">bottom line so it is a form of violence</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.890" end="00:40:23.220" style="s2">or certainly certainly what is the word</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.520" end="00:40:25.710" style="s2">coercion in its in in a real sense you</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.220" end="00:40:28.920" style="s2">know the conformity must be but you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.710" end="00:40:32.370" style="s2">what Americans are hard to fool and and</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.920" end="00:40:35.790" style="s2">Americans don&#39;t like extremes and III</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.370" end="00:40:38.400" style="s2">there is a shitload of pushback not just</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.790" end="00:40:42.360" style="s2">in this or this hard left kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.400" end="00:40:44.040" style="s2">mentality but it&#39;s a big pushback and a</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.360" end="00:40:45.750" style="s2">lot of intellectual pushback as well in</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.040" end="00:40:48.350" style="s2">my opinion and it&#39;s only getting</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.750" end="00:40:51.330" style="s2">stronger I mean I there&#39;s a reason that</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.350" end="00:40:54.030" style="s2">reasonable people who are responsive to</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.330" end="00:40:57.180" style="s2">evidence like yourself like Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.030" end="00:40:58.920" style="s2">Peterson whoever it might be there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.180" end="00:41:00.690" style="s2">reason these people really hit a chord</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.920" end="00:41:02.070" style="s2">the people like to heat listen to them</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.690" end="00:41:04.170" style="s2">because they&#39;re like I knew this other</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.070" end="00:41:06.390" style="s2">stuff wasn&#39;t making that much sense you</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.170" end="00:41:09.120" style="s2">know and I feel like I&#39;m stuck in this</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.390" end="00:41:10.470" style="s2">ideological world and I don&#39;t final you</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.120" end="00:41:11.790" style="s2">guys are calling me racist who you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.470" end="00:41:14.520" style="s2">calling me so you&#39;re telling me I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.790" end="00:41:16.890" style="s2">the into equality I&#39;m not even thinking</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.520" end="00:41:20.540" style="s2">about that I&#39;m a fair-minded person etc</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.890" end="00:41:23.190" style="s2">etc so there&#39;s a lot of pushback but I</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.540" end="00:41:24.840" style="s2">mentioned this to Sam Harris and I think</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.190" end="00:41:28.740" style="s2">I&#39;m going to maybe do a show on this</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.840" end="00:41:30.210" style="s2">podcast called the Hilbert problems the</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.740" end="00:41:33.540" style="s2">topic would be the Hilbert problems of</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.210" end="00:41:36.540" style="s2">social justice and so maybe the easiest</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.540" end="00:41:38.010" style="s2">one is you can&#39;t possibly understand my</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.540" end="00:41:40.680" style="s2">experience because you don&#39;t share it</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.010" end="00:41:43.470" style="s2">and you must understand my experience</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.680" end="00:41:45.060" style="s2">because it&#39;s so important and so you</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.470" end="00:41:47.310" style="s2">just take these two things and then you</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.060" end="00:41:48.030" style="s2">say look I want to discuss those that is</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.310" end="00:41:50.040" style="s2">a couplet</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.030" end="00:41:52.320" style="s2">I must understand and I cannot</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.040" end="00:41:54.300" style="s2">understand because that&#39;s your problem</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.320" end="00:41:56.310" style="s2">after all and what if I can actually</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.300" end="00:41:58.290" style="s2">write a screenplay let&#39;s say or do an</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.310" end="00:41:59.760" style="s2">impression on a stage where you say that</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.290" end="00:42:01.410" style="s2">was so good that there&#39;s no way you</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.760" end="00:42:03.420" style="s2">could have inhabited that character</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.410" end="00:42:06.030" style="s2">without understanding I felt that way</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.420" end="00:42:09.450" style="s2">for example if you remember Eddie Murphy</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.030" end="00:42:11.280" style="s2">is the old Jewish guy I mean he does it</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.450" end="00:42:12.549" style="s2">better Jew than any shoe I know of</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.280" end="00:42:14.410" style="s2">course he does</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.549" end="00:42:17.380" style="s2">he&#39;s an actor and he was around them and</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.410" end="00:42:19.929" style="s2">you know exactly right actly</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.380" end="00:42:21.489" style="s2">and so this idea that again it goes back</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.929" end="00:42:23.049" style="s2">to what goes back to the fact that we</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.489" end="00:42:25.539" style="s2">have a lot more in common with each</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.049" end="00:42:28.449" style="s2">other than we well in order to in order</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.539" end="00:42:32.920" style="s2">to unlock that though don&#39;t we have to</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.449" end="00:42:34.989" style="s2">have enough safety to and this is kind</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.920" end="00:42:38.380" style="s2">of this puzzle for me about the weird</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.989" end="00:42:42.039" style="s2">social justice movement if you create</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.380" end="00:42:45.429" style="s2">canceled culture you&#39;re telling me that</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.039" end="00:42:47.859" style="s2">it is not safe to open my mouth and say</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.429" end="00:42:50.709" style="s2">something that&#39;s right your ideas are</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.859" end="00:42:52.479" style="s2">harmful therefore I&#39;m not going to even</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.709" end="00:42:54.579" style="s2">bring them up to a conscious level</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.479" end="00:42:55.839" style="s2">because they&#39;re far too dangerous what</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.579" end="00:43:11.799" style="s2">if one of them came out of my mouth and</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.839" end="00:43:14.199" style="s2">advertently or inadvertently distributed</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.799" end="00:43:16.599" style="s2">everybody has it that&#39;s probably I mean</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.199" end="00:43:17.859" style="s2">I I have multiple feelings about how I</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.599" end="00:43:21.549" style="s2">feel about different people in different</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.859" end="00:43:23.259" style="s2">circumstances if you don&#39;t allow some of</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.549" end="00:43:25.539" style="s2">this stuff to bubble up and come out</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.259" end="00:43:28.329" style="s2">your mouth and look at it for the</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.539" end="00:43:30.009" style="s2">brainfart that it really is yeah then</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.329" end="00:43:34.869" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re going to sit there</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.009" end="00:43:36.429" style="s2">weirdly guilty I&#39;m either angry that you</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.869" end="00:43:37.869" style="s2">can&#39;t say that you want to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.429" end="00:43:39.910" style="s2">say it yourself or you&#39;re gonna say wow</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.869" end="00:43:42.339" style="s2">I really am ashamed that I actually I</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.910" end="00:43:43.959" style="s2">always say we&#39;ll all of us in my think I</p>

<p begin="00:43:45.519" end="00:43:49.209" style="s2">would get us fired I mean and thank God</p>

<p begin="00:46:16.700" end="00:46:24.740" style="s2">beforehand my interpretation is that it</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.140" end="00:46:26.960" style="s2">is us learning to live with impurity</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.740" end="00:46:29.210" style="s2">that these two drops of water can bother</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.960" end="00:46:30.950" style="s2">your mind well now now the wine isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.210" end="00:46:33.590" style="s2">pure it&#39;s been add watered-down its</p>

<p begin="00:46:38.779" end="00:46:44.839" style="s2">to avoid becoming fanatics about purity</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.189" end="00:46:46.279" style="s2">when I think about the off-ramp I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.839" end="00:46:49.339" style="s2">know if you&#39;ve ever seen this in Saudi</p>

<p begin="00:46:49.339" end="00:46:56.059" style="s2">wonderful off-ramp that says Muslims</p>

<p begin="00:46:56.059" end="00:47:03.049" style="s2">your opera yeah and I think about that I</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.849" end="00:47:06.169" style="s2">think wow I wonder how much of the the</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.049" end="00:47:08.809" style="s2">the division in Islam between things</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.169" end="00:47:10.429" style="s2">that go towards this jihadist craziness</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.809" end="00:47:14.329" style="s2">and the things that make for this</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.429" end="00:47:15.949" style="s2">wonderfully rich welcoming culture some</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.329" end="00:47:17.359" style="s2">in some ways they&#39;re inextricable but I</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.949" end="00:47:19.279" style="s2">wonder how much of it has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.359" end="00:47:21.169" style="s2">which portions of the culture have</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.279" end="00:47:23.119" style="s2">learned to live with impurity well I</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.169" end="00:47:24.859" style="s2">look at our culture Thomas Jefferson</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.119" end="00:47:26.749" style="s2">owns six hundred human beings when he</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.859" end="00:47:27.829" style="s2">wrote all men are created equal that we</p>

<p begin="00:47:27.829" end="00:47:30.589" style="s2">that all men are created equal and</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.179" end="00:47:31.939" style="s2">endowed - that created certain</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.589" end="00:47:33.199" style="s2">inalienable rights among which are life</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.939" end="00:47:35.419" style="s2">liberty the pursuit of happiness</p>

<p begin="00:47:35.419" end="00:47:39.919" style="s2">wrote that I mean we we our peculiar</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.179" end="00:47:41.599" style="s2">institution I mean slavery we&#39;ve been a</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.919" end="00:47:43.549" style="s2">country with slavery longer than when</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.599" end="00:47:46.400" style="s2">we&#39;ve been a country without slavery but</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.549" end="00:47:48.650" style="s2">you&#39;d be hard-pressed to find a freer</p>

<p begin="00:47:48.650" end="00:47:53.390" style="s2">history we are a modern country</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.929" end="00:47:56.809" style="s2">precisely because we continue to wrestle</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.390" end="00:48:00.380" style="s2">with that inconsistency so this is</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.809" end="00:48:01.369" style="s2">something I&#39;d love to dig in to one of</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.380" end="00:48:03.289" style="s2">the weird things about hearing the</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.369" end="00:48:05.239" style="s2">patriarchy of the patriarchy picture is</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.289" end="00:48:07.609" style="s2">the one place that was an actual</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.239" end="00:48:11.509" style="s2">patriarchy was the founding of our</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.609" end="00:48:13.839" style="s2">country and what&#39;s hysterically funny</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.509" end="00:48:18.459" style="s2">and just sort of beautiful about it is</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.839" end="00:48:21.259" style="s2">that the these guys wrote with enough</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.459" end="00:48:23.119" style="s2">generality that they didn&#39;t make the</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.259" end="00:48:25.909" style="s2">mistake of saying all men other than</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.119" end="00:48:28.400" style="s2">Africans are created equal or all men</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.909" end="00:48:30.589" style="s2">are created equal and not you women they</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.400" end="00:48:33.079" style="s2">spoke with a level of generality we&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.589" end="00:48:34.999" style="s2">general life liberty and the pursuit of</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.079" end="00:48:36.799" style="s2">happiness is think about that right you</p>

<p begin="00:48:43.819" end="00:48:47.659" style="s2">happiness is is I don&#39;t know living in</p>

<p begin="00:48:52.099" end="00:48:54.270" style="s2">that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.620" end="00:48:55.710" style="s2">it&#39;s what we come to defend you know</p>

<p begin="00:48:55.710" end="00:49:00.450" style="s2">you better it but the theory in some</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.230" end="00:49:02.310" style="s2">sense was so much more advanced than the</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.450" end="00:49:04.260" style="s2">instantiation at the founding of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.310" end="00:49:07.620" style="s2">country one of the things that I find</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.260" end="00:49:11.910" style="s2">hysterically funny and also hopeful is</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.620" end="00:49:14.190" style="s2">that we we have the opportunity in this</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.910" end="00:49:18.300" style="s2">country and we don&#39;t do it much to teach</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.190" end="00:49:20.220" style="s2">both every lousy stupid hypocritical</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.300" end="00:49:22.440" style="s2">thing we&#39;ve done as a nation many of</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.220" end="00:49:26.160" style="s2">them violent many of them deadly</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.440" end="00:49:27.870" style="s2">and to teach patriotism on top of that</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.160" end="00:49:32.130" style="s2">because if you think about this in terms</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.870" end="00:49:33.570" style="s2">of all countries have histories which</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.130" end="00:49:39.990" style="s2">contain things that they&#39;d rather sweep</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.570" end="00:49:44.130" style="s2">under a rug and somehow patriotism has</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.990" end="00:49:46.410" style="s2">been sort of try people on the right</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.130" end="00:49:47.640" style="s2">really try to take it over and as a fan</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.410" end="00:49:50.790" style="s2">somebody comes from a very progressive</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.640" end="00:49:54.420" style="s2">family which suffered because of let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.790" end="00:49:56.850" style="s2">say the McCarthy era I love this country</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.420" end="00:50:00.330" style="s2">and I know every lousy thing it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.850" end="00:50:04.110" style="s2">ever done yeah do we have an opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.330" end="00:50:05.670" style="s2">to sort of reboot patriotism at a more</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.110" end="00:50:07.620" style="s2">mature level where the love of one</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.670" end="00:50:10.320" style="s2">country is an adult love rather than a</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.620" end="00:50:13.110" style="s2">childlike love I think that most people</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.320" end="00:50:15.360" style="s2">I happen to believe that most people are</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.110" end="00:50:17.730" style="s2">patriotic for the right reasons I think</p>

<p begin="00:57:29.400" end="00:57:33.630" style="s2">your own alpha status there so there was</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.140" end="00:57:35.040" style="s2">a there was a very you know what do you</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.630" end="00:57:39.020" style="s2">want to get into what I wear them the</p>

<p begin="00:57:42.330" end="00:57:47.400" style="s2">we necessarily need an existential</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.400" end="00:57:49.500" style="s2">threat trying to make it in this economy</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.400" end="00:57:53.190" style="s2">and trying to put food on the table and</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.500" end="00:57:55.020" style="s2">gain some leisure time is still as hard</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.190" end="00:57:57.240" style="s2">as it ever has been so maybe that&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.020" end="00:57:58.170" style="s2">don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know the</p>

<p begin="00:57:58.170" end="00:58:04.830" style="s2">but I do think that one of the things we</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.160" end="00:58:08.370" style="s2">need to get back towards and just</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.830" end="00:58:11.070" style="s2">riffing again from the ways in which I</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.370" end="00:58:14.250" style="s2">was observing your crowd deal with stuff</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.070" end="00:58:16.350" style="s2">is twice I&#39;ve been in a social gathering</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.250" end="00:58:18.390" style="s2">with you where there&#39;s been one female</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.350" end="00:58:23.370" style="s2">and a bunch of these guys and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.390" end="00:58:28.470" style="s2">watched how careful all the men are to</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.370" end="00:58:32.640" style="s2">elevate not only the female but whoever</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.470" end="00:58:34.710" style="s2">is there with the lone female in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.640" end="00:58:37.500" style="s2">group and the idea being that when it</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.710" end="00:58:39.600" style="s2">when it when it was my wife the idea was</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.500" end="00:58:41.370" style="s2">people were were holding me up and being</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.600" end="00:58:43.800" style="s2">a little kinder and a little nicer</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.370" end="00:58:46.320" style="s2">because you want to make that person</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.800" end="00:58:47.700" style="s2">look good in the eyes of the woman at</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.320" end="00:58:49.470" style="s2">the table and they&#39;re really astute</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.700" end="00:58:50.670" style="s2">observation I think I agree with you</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.470" end="00:58:54.870" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly what was happened well</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.670" end="00:58:56.940" style="s2">because because in my mind we&#39;ve gotten</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.870" end="00:59:00.870" style="s2">we&#39;ve broken something a little bit in</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.940" end="00:59:03.320" style="s2">terms of male-female relations and we</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.870" end="00:59:07.010" style="s2">are going to be in a process of either</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.320" end="00:59:09.450" style="s2">rediscovering what was lost or ree-ree</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.010" end="00:59:11.880" style="s2">instantiating whatever the abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.450" end="00:59:14.010" style="s2">was that was chivalry do you have any</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.880" end="00:59:18.380" style="s2">thoughts on on where that goes</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.010" end="00:59:21.210" style="s2">like for instance look my experience</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.380" end="00:59:23.550" style="s2">with the men I know that I&#39;m friends</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.210" end="00:59:25.170" style="s2">with and the hardest toughest guys but I</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.550" end="00:59:30.090" style="s2">know and stuff like that they&#39;re all</p>

<p begin="01:12:39.130" end="01:12:45.550" style="s2">right before we launched I guess the the</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.310" end="01:12:47.920" style="s2">portal and she said look I&#39;m going on my</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.550" end="01:12:51.790" style="s2">annual pilgrimage</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.920" end="01:12:53.650" style="s2">and when I get back I&#39;d love to and</p>

<p begin="01:12:53.650" end="01:12:58.260" style="s2">spoken to her a bunch on the phone and</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.380" end="01:13:08.079" style="s2">she was a Mangala twin and her sister</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.540" end="01:13:11.290" style="s2">Miriam was in the camp with her she was</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.079" end="01:13:13.389" style="s2">saying that she looked forward to an</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.290" end="01:13:16.989" style="s2">annual pilgrimage to Auschwitz where she</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.389" end="01:13:18.940" style="s2">was and that Miriam her sister had</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.989" end="01:13:22.449" style="s2">stopped thriving in the medical</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.940" end="01:13:25.540" style="s2">experiments and the only way to save her</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.449" end="01:13:28.690" style="s2">was to steal food to the point about the</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.540" end="01:13:32.409" style="s2">the blueberry had a sister so she stole</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.690" end="01:13:35.590" style="s2">potatoes and she was telling the story</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.409" end="01:13:37.570" style="s2">about stealing potatoes and that the</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.590" end="01:13:39.579" style="s2">penalty for stealing potatoes was death</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.570" end="01:13:42.099" style="s2">yeah and so she stole these potatoes and</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.579" end="01:13:45.099" style="s2">got caught so she was clearly gonna die</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.099" end="01:13:49.389" style="s2">and then she was scolded and like let go</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.099" end="01:13:52.139" style="s2">now she was just a little kid and she</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.389" end="01:13:54.610" style="s2">said huh being part of the medical</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.139" end="01:13:57.760" style="s2">experiment means I&#39;m protected by dr.</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.610" end="01:13:59.650" style="s2">Mengele and so nobody can touch me so</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.760" end="01:14:02.710" style="s2">she continued to steal potatoes in order</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.650" end="01:14:06.159" style="s2">to save her sister and she&#39;s telling me</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.710" end="01:14:08.650" style="s2">this crazy story and I think I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.159" end="01:14:10.179" style="s2">do an episode because she it went to the</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.650" end="01:14:13.030" style="s2">extraordinary length of forgiving</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.179" end="01:14:17.199" style="s2">Mengele and this caused a huge human cry</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.030" end="01:14:19.179" style="s2">and it was Eva Kor and I was dying to</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.199" end="01:14:21.579" style="s2">start the podcast and then I get this</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.179" end="01:14:25.480" style="s2">phone call from her son</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.579" end="01:14:29.260" style="s2">and I find out that she&#39;s died in Poland</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.480" end="01:14:31.540" style="s2">on this last trip Wow so I don&#39;t get to</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.260" end="01:14:35.020" style="s2">bring the story the way I wanted to yeah</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.540" end="01:14:38.530" style="s2">man was this chick tough Oh left you</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.020" end="01:14:39.880" style="s2">know the whole idea anyway when I tell</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.530" end="01:14:44.260" style="s2">the story I think I&#39;ll do it on a</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.880" end="01:14:47.020" style="s2">separate episode of the importance of</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.260" end="01:14:50.670" style="s2">forgiveness and as a almost like a</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.020" end="01:14:54.849" style="s2">weapon and as a structural</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.670" end="01:14:57.610" style="s2">transformative ritualistic option if</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.849" end="01:14:59.920" style="s2">you&#39;ve been victimized this woman gave</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.610" end="01:15:01.219" style="s2">nothing up in terms of toughness and</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.920" end="01:15:02.960" style="s2">then went to these</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.219" end="01:15:05.409" style="s2">ordinary counterintuitive lengths one of</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.960" end="01:15:09.920" style="s2">her last posts I think is her eating</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.409" end="01:15:11.900" style="s2">maybe a McDonald&#39;s meal in Auschwitz and</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.920" end="01:15:14.479" style="s2">sort of laughing about how amazing that</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.900" end="01:15:16.999" style="s2">there&#39;s a McDonald&#39;s near where we had</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.479" end="01:15:20.960" style="s2">automated human ritualistic killing</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.999" end="01:15:22.639" style="s2">Frank you know and Frank I think she</p>

<p begin="01:15:24.289" end="01:15:28.539" style="s2">you know and her father said she shames</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.179" end="01:15:31.999" style="s2">me with her is it positive you know</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.539" end="01:15:33.769" style="s2">outlook but I I think that&#39;s the that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.999" end="01:15:36.769" style="s2">probably one of the reasons Christianity</p>

<p begin="01:17:30.590" end="01:17:35.410" style="s2">it&#39;s my only contention with Sam Harris</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.540" end="01:17:37.760" style="s2">who I really like and I admire but um</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.410" end="01:17:41.030" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna give Sam just a quick lesson</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.760" end="01:17:43.070" style="s2">if I ever meet him on how not to how not</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.030" end="01:17:44.240" style="s2">to start a conversation Sam don&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.070" end="01:17:46.130" style="s2">let&#39;s we have we need a war on Islam</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.240" end="01:17:47.630" style="s2">don&#39;t say that right you can&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.130" end="01:17:48.890" style="s2">because you lose everybody we got to we</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.630" end="01:17:51.380" style="s2">got to be a little bit more we got he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.890" end="01:17:53.330" style="s2">he&#39;s so he&#39;s so painfully honest we you</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.380" end="01:17:55.310" style="s2">know I went on his show about this point</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.330" end="01:17:56.990" style="s2">no you know I didn&#39;t okay so I did it</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.310" end="01:17:58.550" style="s2">but but I&#39;m a fan so you know but I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.990" end="01:18:04.100" style="s2">fan of Sam&#39;s - I mean you were great</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.550" end="01:18:05.360" style="s2">friends I tried to indicate to him that</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.100" end="01:18:07.880" style="s2">there was something counterproductive</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.360" end="01:18:11.210" style="s2">not about his line of thinking but about</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.880" end="01:18:13.610" style="s2">his chosen motive of expression he does</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.210" end="01:18:14.690" style="s2">motional obviously Sam gets emotional I</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.610" end="01:18:16.640" style="s2">think that&#39;s what it well but any</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.690" end="01:18:19.700" style="s2">sublimated right yeah so you know you</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.640" end="01:18:21.790" style="s2">almost never see him video mind its way</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.700" end="01:18:24.790" style="s2">through I took a video of him playing</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.790" end="01:18:27.080" style="s2">centipede on an old arcade machine and</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.790" end="01:18:30.920" style="s2">people loved it because they said oh my</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.080" end="01:18:33.170" style="s2">god he&#39;s human he&#39;s very he&#39;s very zen</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.920" end="01:18:36.140" style="s2">even a very human yes the issue that I</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.170" end="01:18:38.960" style="s2">had was that I didn&#39;t think that Sam</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.140" end="01:18:41.450" style="s2">understood what he was projecting and</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.960" end="01:18:43.730" style="s2">that I said you know you need to say</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.450" end="01:18:45.680" style="s2">some things about the positive aspects</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.730" end="01:18:48.140" style="s2">of this culture well it was like you</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.680" end="01:18:50.720" style="s2">open up this box he&#39;s like I love the</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.140" end="01:18:52.490" style="s2">call to prayer I said what it&#39;s like I</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.720" end="01:18:53.570" style="s2">love the poetry of Rumi and so he starts</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.490" end="01:18:55.760" style="s2">extolling</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.570" end="01:18:57.740" style="s2">some of the some of the advantage so</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.760" end="01:18:59.990" style="s2">he&#39;s an incredibly religious guy for an</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.740" end="01:19:02.900" style="s2">atheist I mean I I do his app waking up</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.990" end="01:19:04.460" style="s2">yeah I love this book spirituality</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.900" end="01:19:06.350" style="s2">without religion right I love his</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.460" end="01:19:09.170" style="s2">podcasts and I and I think that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.350" end="01:19:12.080" style="s2">genuinely sincere about trying to get an</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.170" end="01:19:13.670" style="s2">honest conversation going I fall in line</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.080" end="01:19:16.310" style="s2">with so much of his thinking but I do</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.670" end="01:19:19.640" style="s2">think that he I know I do think he could</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.310" end="01:19:21.650" style="s2">he could he I think he does I think he</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.640" end="01:19:23.420" style="s2">gets emotional yeah I think then he goes</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.650" end="01:19:27.320" style="s2">on the offensive and that&#39;s he&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.420" end="01:19:29.140" style="s2">upset about people not understanding his</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.320" end="01:19:31.630" style="s2">central message I think it whew</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.140" end="01:19:37.180" style="s2">few people understand what it is he is</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.630" end="01:19:39.250" style="s2">not claiming is that Islam is it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.180" end="01:19:41.520" style="s2">terrible thing that it has nothing to</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.250" end="01:19:44.950" style="s2">offer he&#39;s not claiming that religion is</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.520" end="01:19:49.030" style="s2">bereft of good ideas or important ritual</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.950" end="01:19:51.940" style="s2">what he&#39;s weirdly saying doesn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.030" end="01:19:53.970" style="s2">picked up is i sam harris believe that</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.940" end="01:19:56.380" style="s2">there is nothing that can be done</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.970" end="01:19:58.360" style="s2">irrationally through a crazy belief</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.380" end="01:20:03.190" style="s2">system that couldn&#39;t be done better at</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.360" end="01:20:05.680" style="s2">scale using reason but that&#39;s great</p>

<p begin="01:20:11.070" end="01:20:16.660" style="s2">so so so the value therein let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.380" end="01:20:20.500" style="s2">take christ as an example sure bible or</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.660" end="01:20:22.600" style="s2">any story or even plato&#39;s forms were</p>

<p begin="01:20:29.620" end="01:20:33.970" style="s2">imagine it but you should reach for it</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.630" end="01:20:36.760" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna miss but the reach is what</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.970" end="01:20:39.550" style="s2">matters so so doing the right thing a</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.760" end="01:20:41.470" style="s2">lot of times might be very much against</p>

<p begin="01:21:34.300" end="01:21:37.900" style="s2">to talk about non-violence and he says I</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.640" end="01:21:39.730" style="s2">believe that my philosophy of</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.900" end="01:21:42.670" style="s2">non-violence is superior to the other</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.730" end="01:21:45.100" style="s2">two but given a choice between violence</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.670" end="01:21:46.840" style="s2">and pacifism I would always choose</p>

<p begin="01:21:48.910" end="01:21:55.179" style="s2">him it&#39;s so Gandhi the Gandhi that we</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.670" end="01:21:58.660" style="s2">think of as the simple kindly saintly</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.179" end="01:22:00.250" style="s2">figure is not actual Gandhi and Gandhi</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.660" end="01:22:02.199" style="s2">was an Anglophile I know he&#39;s a lawyer</p>

<p begin="01:22:05.550" end="01:22:12.280" style="s2">don&#39;t mistake non-violence for pacifism</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.390" end="01:22:14.500" style="s2">non-violence requires the most courage</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.280" end="01:22:18.280" style="s2">because you&#39;re going to put yourself in</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.500" end="01:22:21.130" style="s2">harm&#39;s way with a pre commitment not to</p>

<p begin="01:22:21.130" end="01:22:28.449" style="s2">that level of badassery choose violence</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.730" end="01:22:30.850" style="s2">and why because the worst thing you can</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.449" end="01:22:34.540" style="s2">do is to be passive and to let your</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.850" end="01:22:37.060" style="s2">nation you know be raped as India was by</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.540" end="01:22:38.650" style="s2">the Brits so this is like ye may have</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.060" end="01:22:40.179" style="s2">been a strategic cuz I don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.650" end="01:22:42.219" style="s2">that policy of non-violence would have</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.179" end="01:22:44.230" style="s2">worked against the Nazis the Germans</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.219" end="01:22:46.060" style="s2">would have just shot him and they would</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.230" end="01:22:47.500" style="s2">have just opened up on anybody it worked</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.060" end="01:22:49.060" style="s2">with the British Empire because the</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.500" end="01:22:50.230" style="s2">British Empire had elections they had</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.060" end="01:22:52.920" style="s2">Parliament there&#39;s a question of who</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.230" end="01:22:54.820" style="s2">does who does the non-violence and I</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.920" end="01:22:56.920" style="s2">don&#39;t know if you know about the Rosen&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.820" end="01:22:59.140" style="s2">stress of protest terms you want to talk</p>

<p begin="01:22:59.140" end="01:23:06.730" style="s2">I think was 1943 in Berlin a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.670" end="01:23:08.679" style="s2">women who were married to Jewish men or</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.730" end="01:23:12.690" style="s2">partially Jewish men but were not Jewish</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.679" end="01:23:15.160" style="s2">themselves decided that they would show</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.690" end="01:23:18.040" style="s2">Nazi Germany what&#39;s what and get their</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.160" end="01:23:19.300" style="s2">husbands back and they organized to</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.040" end="01:23:20.739" style="s2">protest I don&#39;t know why this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.300" end="01:23:23.469" style="s2">famous it makes me feel like I&#39;m crazy</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.739" end="01:23:27.520" style="s2">for bringing it up they organized a</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.469" end="01:23:31.179" style="s2">protest in the Rosen Strasse of the</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.520" end="01:23:34.390" style="s2">street and they made such an</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.179" end="01:23:36.670" style="s2">embarrassing show in front of the Nazis</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.390" end="01:23:39.250" style="s2">that the Nazis I believe acquiesced and</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.670" end="01:23:40.660" style="s2">got these men out of the camps and</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.250" end="01:23:43.330" style="s2">returned to the women so it was like a</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.660" end="01:23:49.120" style="s2">Wow well this is the thing about the</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.330" end="01:23:52.449" style="s2">power of wives and mothers and beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.120" end="01:23:55.260" style="s2">young women you know who are you know</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.449" end="01:24:00.180" style="s2">nubile just means marriage able</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.260" end="01:24:04.710" style="s2">we are so when women organize themselves</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.180" end="01:24:06.480" style="s2">effectively they can bring mail systems</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.710" end="01:24:08.610" style="s2">you know really to their knees because</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.480" end="01:24:11.160" style="s2">there&#39;s no good way of saying we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.610" end="01:24:13.430" style="s2">against motherhood were against love</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.160" end="01:24:16.560" style="s2">were against anything that is</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.430" end="01:24:17.670" style="s2">aspirationally kind of pure yeah</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.560" end="01:24:19.320" style="s2">somebody&#39;s drug people have drawn</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.670" end="01:24:21.720" style="s2">correlations between women&#39;s rights and</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.320" end="01:24:23.640" style="s2">healthcare and the advent of health care</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.720" end="01:24:26.670" style="s2">and things and which is why the marks</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.640" end="01:24:29.540" style="s2">was so confusing to me because that was</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.670" end="01:24:33.540" style="s2">a tremendous amount of power to mobilize</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.540" end="01:24:36.840" style="s2">but without a very clear follow-through</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.540" end="01:24:38.610" style="s2">and with some very dubious you know I</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.840" end="01:24:40.680" style="s2">think that a lot of us fear that there</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.610" end="01:24:42.870" style="s2">was some kind of anti-semitism that was</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.680" end="01:24:45.600" style="s2">behind some of the organization of that</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.870" end="01:24:48.030" style="s2">but just in terms of what could you get</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.600" end="01:24:50.370" style="s2">the Nazis to take note of I&#39;ve always</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.030" end="01:24:53.010" style="s2">been fascinated by who protested the</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.370" end="01:24:54.870" style="s2">Nazis effectively there was another case</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.010" end="01:24:57.360" style="s2">which you might know through through</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.870" end="01:24:59.010" style="s2">boxing I think the guy&#39;s name was</p>

<p begin="01:25:22.050" end="01:25:28.320" style="s2">go down because he wasn&#39;t pure an Aryan</p>

<p begin="01:36:09.760" end="01:36:13.180" style="s2">like the issue of binary good guy bad</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.880" end="01:36:17.230" style="s2">guy</p>

<p begin="01:36:33.040" end="01:36:38.650" style="s2">well because nuance you know the way the</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.220" end="01:36:43.600" style="s2">way I keep encountering this I&#39;ve made a</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.650" end="01:36:45.880" style="s2">big point of this they view nuance like</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.600" end="01:36:48.970" style="s2">the Israelis view and olive grove it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.880" end="01:36:51.340" style="s2">place for snipers to hide so we have to</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.970" end="01:36:53.200" style="s2">we have to take down the olive trees so</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.340" end="01:36:54.850" style="s2">there won&#39;t be any snipers I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.200" end="01:36:56.470" style="s2">piece so badly and that metaphors this</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.850" end="01:36:58.420" style="s2">made me forget about my P which is well</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.470" end="01:37:00.790" style="s2">we&#39;re taking a break with Bryan Callen</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.420" end="01:37:02.740" style="s2">taking a break when we returned Bryan</p>

<p begin="01:37:08.770" end="01:37:12.670" style="s2">switch into another area that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.170" end="01:37:15.999" style="s2">think we&#39;ve really touched on much which</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.670" end="01:37:18.999" style="s2">is your fascination with</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.999" end="01:37:21.519" style="s2">pretty deep science and with the way in</p>
<p begin="01:37:18.999" end="01:37:23.590" style="s2">which it even works its way into your</p>
<p begin="01:37:21.519" end="01:37:26.110" style="s2">comedy routines and into your thinking</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.590" end="01:37:29.499" style="s2">yeah how is it that alright first of all</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.110" end="01:37:31.599" style="s2">I have this impression that I grew up in</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.499" end="01:37:33.039" style="s2">LA and I used to come to some of the</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.599" end="01:37:35.380" style="s2">comedy clubs they&#39;d go to the improv</p>
<p begin="01:37:33.039" end="01:37:37.150" style="s2">probably more than anything else and I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.380" end="01:37:39.400" style="s2">see comedians and they&#39;d suddenly switch</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.150" end="01:37:42.400" style="s2">into other languages they&#39;d switch into</p>
<p begin="01:37:39.400" end="01:37:44.079" style="s2">discussions of science or really</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.400" end="01:37:46.329" style="s2">abstract discussions of history for the</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.079" end="01:37:49.119" style="s2">material and I came to think of</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.329" end="01:37:51.159" style="s2">comedians very often as being kind of</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.119" end="01:37:54.159" style="s2">unregulated super mines is that</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.159" end="01:37:55.420" style="s2">something that you think is I mean is</p>
<p begin="01:37:54.159" end="01:37:57.130" style="s2">that I don&#39;t think so do you know where</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.420" end="01:37:58.780" style="s2">it comes from and I&#39;ve been I&#39;ve been in</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.130" end="01:38:00.340" style="s2">the business too long to think that most</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.780" end="01:38:03.130" style="s2">most communities aren&#39;t interested in</p>
<p begin="01:38:00.340" end="01:38:05.170" style="s2">anything but I mean no Steve Martin yeah</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.130" end="01:38:07.689" style="s2">it&#39;s like banjo and the Robin Williams</p>
<p begin="01:38:05.170" end="01:38:10.209" style="s2">who switch into a million different head</p>
<p begin="01:38:07.689" end="01:38:13.539" style="s2">spaces and space I mean look at the the</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.209" end="01:38:16.360" style="s2">I always say that I&#39;m in the business</p>
<p begin="01:38:13.539" end="01:38:18.400" style="s2">the one thing I that drives me is</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.360" end="01:38:19.959" style="s2">original self-expression okay that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.400" end="01:38:21.459" style="s2">what I&#39;m interested in I&#39;m interested in</p>
<p begin="01:38:19.959" end="01:38:24.280" style="s2">in expressing myself fully and</p>
<p begin="01:38:21.459" end="01:38:26.170" style="s2">originally and that responsibility is</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.280" end="01:38:28.809" style="s2">always pretty daunting you know you want</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.170" end="01:38:30.400" style="s2">it and so whatever it takes you know</p>
<p begin="01:38:28.809" end="01:38:31.959" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s you get to a point as a</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.400" end="01:38:34.030" style="s2">comic where you know how to make people</p>
<p begin="01:38:31.959" end="01:38:36.610" style="s2">laugh I can write stuff and that&#39;s a bag</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.030" end="01:38:38.860" style="s2">of tricks then can you be thematic can</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.610" end="01:38:42.189" style="s2">you be original can you be saying</p>
<p begin="01:38:38.860" end="01:38:43.929" style="s2">something and that&#39;s where the real</p>
<p begin="01:38:42.189" end="01:38:46.749" style="s2">challenge is you get older you know</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.929" end="01:38:47.829" style="s2">writing out an hour of comedy well you</p>
<p begin="01:38:46.749" end="01:38:49.959" style="s2">know okay</p>
<p begin="01:38:47.829" end="01:38:52.479" style="s2">let&#39;s see what happens now what what are</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.959" end="01:38:54.519" style="s2">you trying to talk about I mean I spent</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.479" end="01:38:57.579" style="s2">all this time boxing and trying to stay</p>
<p begin="01:38:54.519" end="01:39:00.070" style="s2">in shape and going beyond my biology and</p>
<p begin="01:38:57.579" end="01:39:02.439" style="s2">being ready and you know and keeping my</p>
<p begin="01:39:00.070" end="01:39:05.289" style="s2">home safe and whatever it might be but</p>
<p begin="01:39:02.439" end="01:39:07.689" style="s2">there are too many flanks to cover well</p>
<p begin="01:39:05.289" end="01:39:10.570" style="s2">what where&#39;s the funny in that you know</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.689" end="01:39:13.599" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna die I&#39;m getting older and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:39:10.570" end="01:39:19.209" style="s2">way more vulnerable than I can even</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.599" end="01:39:20.679" style="s2">imagine so again like let&#39;s see if I can</p>
<p begin="01:39:19.209" end="01:39:22.150" style="s2">be original about that and let&#39;s see if</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.679" end="01:39:24.820" style="s2">I can discover something and shocked</p>
<p begin="01:39:22.150" end="01:39:28.300" style="s2">myself and surprised myself with with my</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.820" end="01:39:29.200" style="s2">next sixty minutes of comedy that I</p>
<p begin="01:39:28.300" end="01:39:31.330" style="s2">guess so</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.200" end="01:39:34.180" style="s2">unregulated super minds I don&#39;t think of</p>
<p begin="01:39:31.330" end="01:39:36.400" style="s2">it that way I just think about probably</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.180" end="01:39:40.720" style="s2">minutes a dysregulated oh okay yeah</p>
<p begin="01:39:36.400" end="01:39:42.160" style="s2">dysregulated yeah III just it&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="01:39:40.720" end="01:39:44.080" style="s2">privilege to belong to this very small</p>
<p begin="01:39:42.160" end="01:39:45.310" style="s2">fraternity this small group of people</p>
<p begin="01:39:44.080" end="01:39:46.420" style="s2">that can get up in front of anybody in</p>
<p begin="01:39:45.310" end="01:39:49.950" style="s2">the world and make them laugh</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.420" end="01:39:53.980" style="s2">III that&#39;s never lost on me right so I I</p>
<p begin="01:39:49.950" end="01:39:55.330" style="s2">I feel very lucky that I can do that and</p>
<p begin="01:39:53.980" end="01:39:58.000" style="s2">that I&#39;m part of this small group of</p>
<p begin="01:39:55.330" end="01:40:01.240" style="s2">people that that does that over and over</p>
<p begin="01:39:58.000" end="01:40:03.610" style="s2">again so you have have shown like</p>
<p begin="01:40:01.240" end="01:40:05.110" style="s2">essentially no interest promoting your</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.610" end="01:40:07.270" style="s2">own stuff I wonder if I could just ask</p>
<p begin="01:40:05.110" end="01:40:10.300" style="s2">you to take a couple of younger</p>
<p begin="01:40:07.270" end="01:40:11.890" style="s2">colleagues and maybe lift them up for</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.300" end="01:40:13.810" style="s2">our audience who should we be watching</p>
<p begin="01:40:11.890" end="01:40:17.170" style="s2">who&#39;s coming up who you think is really</p>
<p begin="01:40:13.810" end="01:40:20.410" style="s2">deep in terms of observation and saying</p>
<p begin="01:40:17.170" end="01:40:22.120" style="s2">so using comedy carmichael was doing</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.410" end="01:40:23.290" style="s2">stand-up for a long time and I think he</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.120" end="01:40:26.800" style="s2">said he wanted to quit which is a</p>
<p begin="01:40:23.290" end="01:40:28.690" style="s2">tragedy because he was so unique and his</p>
<p begin="01:40:26.800" end="01:40:30.580" style="s2">success is not an accident I he was</p>
<p begin="01:40:28.690" end="01:40:32.170" style="s2">opening for myself and a guy named of</p>
<p begin="01:40:30.580" end="01:40:34.750" style="s2">Davidoff one of my favorite comics and</p>
<p begin="01:40:32.170" end="01:40:36.760" style="s2">favorite people and and I just</p>
<p begin="01:40:34.750" end="01:40:40.090" style="s2">immediately was shocked at how smart</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.760" end="01:40:42.550" style="s2">this kid was no money I think he comes</p>

<p begin="01:43:32.260" end="01:43:39.880" style="s2">you tell me about your fascination with</p>
<p begin="01:43:37.060" end="01:43:45.180" style="s2">science what you&#39;re trying to hide and</p>
<p begin="01:43:39.880" end="01:43:47.590" style="s2">cover up well I just think that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:45.180" end="01:43:50.320" style="s2">like maybe like mathematics I mean</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.590" end="01:43:52.540" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a there&#39;s first of all</p>
<p begin="01:43:50.320" end="01:43:54.070" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of people who claim that</p>
<p begin="01:43:52.540" end="01:43:56.200" style="s2">this is scientific and things like that</p>
<p begin="01:43:54.070" end="01:43:58.570" style="s2">and but um</p>
<p begin="01:43:56.200" end="01:44:00.970" style="s2">I like science because at the heart of</p>
<p begin="01:43:58.570" end="01:44:02.880" style="s2">science it seems that you start with</p>
<p begin="01:44:00.970" end="01:44:07.120" style="s2">doubt and you continue with doubt and</p>
<p begin="01:44:02.880" end="01:44:09.400" style="s2">and usually the though I guess I would</p>
<p begin="01:44:07.120" end="01:44:12.130" style="s2">define science or the scientific method</p>
<p begin="01:44:09.400" end="01:44:14.470" style="s2">as that which you can measure and that</p>
<p begin="01:44:12.130" end="01:44:16.270" style="s2">which you can replicate under the same</p>
<p begin="01:44:14.470" end="01:44:17.620" style="s2">circumstances I think I&#39;m right about</p>
<p begin="01:44:16.270" end="01:44:19.570" style="s2">that I mean to an extent at least</p>

<p begin="01:44:53.590" end="01:45:02.350" style="s2">scientists like Fleming etc those</p>
<p begin="01:44:58.150" end="01:45:04.390" style="s2">scientists those physicists we owe them</p>

<p begin="01:48:00.459" end="01:48:06.089" style="s2">if you remember this one of the lies</p>
<p begin="01:48:02.139" end="01:48:09.429" style="s2">about AIDS was that it just began in the</p>
<p begin="01:48:06.089" end="01:48:11.649" style="s2">homosexual community and that there was</p>
<p begin="01:48:09.429" end="01:48:14.499" style="s2">no difference between heterosexual and</p>
<p begin="01:48:11.649" end="01:48:17.050" style="s2">homosexual transmission and that was a</p>
<p begin="01:48:14.499" end="01:48:20.349" style="s2">an attempt at a compassionate lie yeah</p>
<p begin="01:48:17.050" end="01:48:21.819" style="s2">but it was not actually Muslim true well</p>
<p begin="01:48:20.349" end="01:48:23.710" style="s2">but it was also not compassionate</p>
<p begin="01:48:21.819" end="01:48:26.080" style="s2">because the more that you told these</p>
<p begin="01:48:23.710" end="01:48:27.840" style="s2">sort of superficial lies the less you</p>
<p begin="01:48:26.080" end="01:48:29.260" style="s2">could actually get at who was at risk</p>
<p begin="01:48:27.840" end="01:48:31.510" style="s2">why</p>
<p begin="01:48:29.260" end="01:48:33.100" style="s2">well news organizations and and I read a</p>

<p begin="01:48:38.230" end="01:48:43.060" style="s2">a lot of pressure on news organizations</p>
<p begin="01:48:40.750" end="01:48:46.210" style="s2">to go out and find heterosexuals with</p>
<p begin="01:48:43.060" end="01:48:48.130" style="s2">AIDS right and they combed the the</p>
<p begin="01:48:46.210" end="01:48:49.540" style="s2">landscape for it and found a couple of</p>
<p begin="01:48:48.130" end="01:48:51.460" style="s2">women who were straight who had AIDS</p>
<p begin="01:48:49.540" end="01:48:52.180" style="s2">just to make sure that it wasn&#39;t just a</p>

<p begin="01:48:52.180" end="01:48:57.310" style="s2">well it wasn&#39;t well it but but but so</p>
<p begin="01:48:55.420" end="01:48:59.980" style="s2">why so they couldn&#39;t figure out why it</p>
<p begin="01:48:57.310" end="01:49:02.260" style="s2">was a heterosexual disease in Southeast</p>
<p begin="01:48:59.980" end="01:49:04.719" style="s2">Asia in Africa but it wasn&#39;t an in North</p>
<p begin="01:49:02.260" end="01:49:06.700" style="s2">nor in Europe in European populations in</p>
<p begin="01:49:04.719" end="01:49:10.570" style="s2">the Middle East well why why was it also</p>
<p begin="01:49:06.700" end="01:49:12.400" style="s2">a certain and gay men got it but in fact</p>
<p begin="01:49:10.570" end="01:49:16.000" style="s2">the gay men that did get it were the</p>
<p begin="01:49:12.400" end="01:49:18.370" style="s2">ones taking you know the bottoms if you</p>
<p begin="01:49:16.000" end="01:49:19.719" style="s2">will right tops a lot of times survived</p>
<p begin="01:49:18.370" end="01:49:22.180" style="s2">the epidemic and I know a number of them</p>
<p begin="01:49:19.719" end="01:49:23.770" style="s2">who did it through my theater days we</p>
<p begin="01:49:22.180" end="01:49:25.570" style="s2">couldn&#39;t figure it out it wasn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="01:49:23.770" end="01:49:29.380" style="s2">secondary infection was it health care</p>
<p begin="01:49:25.570" end="01:49:30.640" style="s2">in Africa no what what happened was the</p>
<p begin="01:49:29.380" end="01:49:32.530" style="s2">bubonic plague I think we you and I</p>
<p begin="01:49:30.640" end="01:49:35.530" style="s2">talked about and they have what if you</p>
<p begin="01:49:32.530" end="01:49:37.630" style="s2">survive the bubonic plague and you you</p>
<p begin="01:49:35.530" end="01:49:39.160" style="s2">have some gene variation that developed</p>
<p begin="01:49:37.630" end="01:49:41.469" style="s2">where you have a resistance to the</p>
<p begin="01:49:39.160" end="01:49:44.230" style="s2">actual disease unless it&#39;s pushed into</p>
<p begin="01:49:41.469" end="01:49:46.570" style="s2">your body with a hypodermic needle or or</p>
<p begin="01:49:44.230" end="01:49:47.800" style="s2">somebody&#39;s dick if you were you know but</p>
<p begin="01:49:46.570" end="01:49:50.739" style="s2">but otherwise it&#39;s gonna be hard to</p>
<p begin="01:49:47.800" end="01:49:52.480" style="s2">contract it that&#39;s why the army couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:49:50.739" end="01:49:54.790" style="s2">figure out they&#39;ve test everybody for</p>
<p begin="01:49:52.480" end="01:49:56.739" style="s2">AIDS and it was the the cases were slim</p>
<p begin="01:49:54.790" end="01:50:00.100" style="s2">to vanishing and at least people that</p>
<p begin="01:49:56.739" end="01:50:01.510" style="s2">were admittedly heterosexual right and</p>
<p begin="01:50:00.100" end="01:50:03.340" style="s2">then we started to see that there is</p>
<p begin="01:50:01.510" end="01:50:05.170" style="s2">something going on here that that it was</p>
<p begin="01:50:03.340" end="01:50:08.219" style="s2">it did discriminate the disease did</p>
<p begin="01:50:05.170" end="01:50:10.840" style="s2">discriminate not because God said it so</p>
<p begin="01:50:08.219" end="01:50:13.360" style="s2">because there was a genetic there was a</p>
<p begin="01:50:10.840" end="01:50:16.450" style="s2">generic genetic mutation thanks to the</p>
<p begin="01:50:13.360" end="01:50:18.810" style="s2">bubonic plague anyway so why do I like</p>
<p begin="01:50:16.450" end="01:50:21.100" style="s2">science I guess it gives me some answers</p>
<p begin="01:50:18.810" end="01:50:24.760" style="s2">it&#39;s more than you like science I mean</p>
<p begin="01:50:21.100" end="01:50:26.410" style="s2">you&#39;re pretty if you incorporate science</p>
<p begin="01:50:24.760" end="01:50:29.260" style="s2">into your comedy yeah</p>
<p begin="01:50:26.410" end="01:50:31.650" style="s2">and I was curious as to whether those</p>
<p begin="01:50:29.260" end="01:50:35.590" style="s2">two parts of your brain play</p>
<p begin="01:50:31.650" end="01:50:37.380" style="s2">harmoniously and tight I would be so</p>
<p begin="01:50:35.590" end="01:50:39.090" style="s2">lucky you</p>
<p begin="01:50:37.380" end="01:50:41.760" style="s2">I mean I&#39;m not worried I&#39;m not in your</p>
<p begin="01:50:39.090" end="01:50:44.670" style="s2">area code in terms of your ability to</p>
<p begin="01:50:41.760" end="01:50:46.110" style="s2">jump between the Romantics and Sun I&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="01:50:46.110" end="01:50:49.590" style="s2">seen how many topics have you jumped</p>
<p begin="01:50:47.430" end="01:50:51.480" style="s2">between this I mean you&#39;re all over the</p>
<p begin="01:50:49.590" end="01:50:53.520" style="s2">place that no man you have a deeper I</p>

<p begin="01:50:53.520" end="01:50:59.430" style="s2">literature and poetry and music and so I</p>
<p begin="01:50:57.480" end="01:51:02.130" style="s2">actually never met anybody like that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:50:59.430" end="01:51:03.900" style="s2">very glad you&#39;re a polymath that&#39;s how I</p>
<p begin="01:51:02.130" end="01:51:05.220" style="s2">feel about you the the thing I was</p>
<p begin="01:51:03.900" end="01:51:07.940" style="s2">trying to figure out though and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:51:05.220" end="01:51:14.870" style="s2">something I haven&#39;t cracked it would be</p>
<p begin="01:51:07.940" end="01:51:18.690" style="s2">can we use comedy as a means of</p>
<p begin="01:51:14.870" end="01:51:21.330" style="s2">delivering deeper analytic truths is</p>
<p begin="01:51:18.690" end="01:51:24.540" style="s2">there a natural fit so for example if I</p>
<p begin="01:51:21.330" end="01:51:27.510" style="s2">make something rhyme the brain remembers</p>
<p begin="01:51:24.540" end="01:51:29.850" style="s2">it more easily I I set people by saying</p>
<p begin="01:51:27.510" end="01:51:33.960" style="s2">things that rhyme are more likely to be</p>
<p begin="01:51:29.850" end="01:51:36.900" style="s2">true and what I really mean is that when</p>
<p begin="01:51:33.960" end="01:51:39.210" style="s2">people work out a very pithy aphorism or</p>
<p begin="01:51:36.900" end="01:51:40.710" style="s2">or a rhyme to remember something</p>
<p begin="01:51:39.210" end="01:51:42.960" style="s2">it meant somebody said this was</p>
<p begin="01:51:40.710" end="01:51:45.270" style="s2">important enough to construct something</p>
<p begin="01:51:42.960" end="01:51:48.480" style="s2">that the brain will find sticky and a</p>
<p begin="01:51:45.270" end="01:51:50.430" style="s2">joke like almost every joke contains an</p>
<p begin="01:51:48.480" end="01:51:52.200" style="s2">element of surprise if you saw something</p>
<p begin="01:51:50.430" end="01:51:53.610" style="s2">it wouldn&#39;t be fun right that&#39;s right</p>

<p begin="01:54:26.170" end="01:54:32.110" style="s2">had this good-natured debate at this</p>
<p begin="01:54:28.450" end="01:54:36.480" style="s2">this college that and and Matthew Arnold</p>

<p begin="01:54:42.370" end="01:54:49.300" style="s2">the we man started as protozoa and</p>
<p begin="01:54:45.610" end="01:54:52.780" style="s2">became this pointy eared long-tailed</p>

<p begin="01:54:54.280" end="01:55:01.120" style="s2">the origin of the species yes absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:54:56.890" end="01:55:03.480" style="s2">or of there&#39;s no question that evolution</p>
<p begin="01:55:01.120" end="01:55:06.660" style="s2">is true I believe in evolution</p>
<p begin="01:55:03.480" end="01:55:08.520" style="s2">but as Matthew Arnold said maybe it is</p>

<p begin="01:55:08.520" end="01:55:12.180" style="s2">became monkeys but there was something</p>

<p begin="01:55:12.180" end="01:55:17.340" style="s2">Greek there was something about that</p>
<p begin="01:55:14.370" end="01:55:19.700" style="s2">monkey yeah it created the deep and dark</p>

<p begin="01:56:30.450" end="01:56:35.640" style="s2">inspiration do you know what this is</p>
<p begin="01:56:32.460" end="01:56:37.860" style="s2">this is a Klein model and the weird</p>
<p begin="01:56:35.640" end="01:56:40.050" style="s2">thing about it is is that it only really</p>
<p begin="01:56:37.860" end="01:56:42.270" style="s2">exists in four dimensions so this is a</p>
<p begin="01:56:40.050" end="01:56:44.670" style="s2">model of Klein bottle technically we</p>
<p begin="01:56:42.270" end="01:56:47.220" style="s2">would say it is immersed in our three</p>
<p begin="01:56:44.670" end="01:56:48.990" style="s2">because this handle should not be going</p>
<p begin="01:56:47.220" end="01:56:50.850" style="s2">through this part of the bottle and so</p>
<p begin="01:56:48.990" end="01:56:53.550" style="s2">there&#39;s no inside and no outside it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:56:50.850" end="01:56:55.440" style="s2">like I&#39;m - Mobius band sewn together the</p>

<p begin="01:56:55.440" end="01:57:00.600" style="s2">bottle was that I was given my father&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:57:03.180" end="01:57:06.810" style="s2">was this it was a fundraiser for</p>
<p begin="01:57:04.800" end="01:57:09.450" style="s2">terminal flatulence that looked really</p>
<p begin="01:57:06.810" end="01:57:11.970" style="s2">official right but you showed a toilet</p>
<p begin="01:57:09.450" end="01:57:13.680" style="s2">blown apart and you know people suffer</p>
<p begin="01:57:11.970" end="01:57:15.430" style="s2">from terminal flatulence but it is</p>
<p begin="01:57:13.680" end="01:57:20.190" style="s2">potentially curable it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:57:15.430" end="01:57:23.830" style="s2">at the end of this crazy-like foundation</p>
<p begin="01:57:20.190" end="01:57:25.960" style="s2">promotion fundraiser on the back page of</p>
<p begin="01:57:23.830" end="01:57:27.460" style="s2">this thing was a short story about a</p>
<p begin="01:57:25.960" end="01:57:29.770" style="s2">client bottle that was used as a</p>
<p begin="01:57:27.460" end="01:57:31.780" style="s2">contraceptive device and the idea is</p>
<p begin="01:57:29.770" end="01:57:33.370" style="s2">that it would take the sperm and send it</p>
<p begin="01:57:31.780" end="01:57:35.680" style="s2">to the fourth dimension so no one would</p>
<p begin="01:57:33.370" end="01:57:37.780" style="s2">get pregnant but this guy gets stucked</p>
<p begin="01:57:35.680" end="01:57:41.140" style="s2">in the Klein bottle now this is a</p>
<p begin="01:57:37.780" end="01:57:43.570" style="s2">completely crazy insane thing but I</p>
<p begin="01:57:41.140" end="01:57:45.400" style="s2">never heard a clone bottle yeah and I</p>
<p begin="01:57:43.570" end="01:57:47.680" style="s2">remember reading the story and saying</p>
<p begin="01:57:45.400" end="01:57:50.320" style="s2">I&#39;ve got to find out what that is is</p>
<p begin="01:57:47.680" end="01:57:52.390" style="s2">that a real thing sure enough you know</p>
<p begin="01:57:50.320" end="01:57:55.210" style="s2">there was an entire topological theory</p>
<p begin="01:57:52.390" end="01:57:57.790" style="s2">of non-orientable manifolds and the only</p>
<p begin="01:57:55.210" end="01:58:01.930" style="s2">way that I got to it was from a humor</p>
<p begin="01:57:57.790" end="01:58:03.640" style="s2">magazine right yeah that&#39;s correct well</p>
<p begin="01:58:01.930" end="01:58:07.150" style="s2">what about the idea that you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="01:58:03.640" end="01:58:08.770" style="s2">mathematician so I heard there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:58:07.150" end="01:58:11.050" style="s2">a great course called the great ideas of</p>
<p begin="01:58:08.770" end="01:58:13.270" style="s2">philosophy and it&#39;s it&#39;s in it from the</p>
<p begin="01:58:11.050" end="01:58:16.270" style="s2">teaching company and I just quoted a</p>
<p begin="01:58:13.270" end="01:58:18.190" style="s2">little bit of David Robinson dan</p>
<p begin="01:58:16.270" end="01:58:19.840" style="s2">Robinson who is written more about</p>
<p begin="01:58:18.190" end="01:58:23.200" style="s2">philosophy than anybody in the past</p>
<p begin="01:58:19.840" end="01:58:25.450" style="s2">thirty years but he said something</p>
<p begin="01:58:23.200" end="01:58:27.820" style="s2">interesting you talked about how you</p>
<p begin="01:58:25.450" end="01:58:30.460" style="s2">know a theoretical mathematician spends</p>
<p begin="01:58:27.820" end="01:58:32.650" style="s2">their whole life you know they had a</p>
<p begin="01:58:30.460" end="01:58:34.870" style="s2">dream about some of this possibility</p>
<p begin="01:58:32.650" end="01:58:35.980" style="s2">this mathematical possibility and they</p>
<p begin="01:58:34.870" end="01:58:37.660" style="s2">spend their whole life coming up with</p>
<p begin="01:58:35.980" end="01:58:40.030" style="s2">this equation that they solve and it</p>
<p begin="01:58:37.660" end="01:58:43.630" style="s2">bears no real relevance to the material</p>
<p begin="01:58:40.030" end="01:58:45.550" style="s2">world but then they die and okay and</p>
<p begin="01:58:43.630" end="01:58:46.750" style="s2">thanks a lot and we have this theorem</p>
<p begin="01:58:45.550" end="01:58:48.190" style="s2">that I guess you came up with it was</p>
<p begin="01:58:46.750" end="01:58:48.760" style="s2">probably 300 pages long or something</p>
<p begin="01:58:48.190" end="01:58:50.800" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="01:58:48.760" end="01:58:53.950" style="s2">and then about a hundred years later or</p>
<p begin="01:58:50.800" end="01:58:56.260" style="s2">20 years later whenever it it&#39;s used to</p>
<p begin="01:58:53.950" end="01:58:58.210" style="s2">put a rover on Mars or something and it</p>
<p begin="01:58:56.260" end="01:59:01.990" style="s2">does bear direct relevance to the</p>
<p begin="01:58:58.210" end="01:59:04.150" style="s2">material world so you know again it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:59:01.990" end="01:59:06.070" style="s2">what we talked about before it was like</p>
<p begin="01:59:04.150" end="01:59:07.750" style="s2">there are certain mythologies you you</p>
<p begin="01:59:06.070" end="01:59:09.550" style="s2">can disprove that all men are created</p>
<p begin="01:59:07.750" end="01:59:12.400" style="s2">equal with biology and math you can</p>
<p begin="01:59:09.550" end="01:59:13.930" style="s2">actually disprove it very easily you can</p>
<p begin="01:59:12.400" end="01:59:17.650" style="s2">take LeBron James and send this to a</p>
<p begin="01:59:13.930" end="01:59:19.390" style="s2">hole sends a bunch of tests but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:59:17.650" end="01:59:21.490" style="s2">a deeper truth to it when we</p>
<p begin="01:59:19.390" end="01:59:24.400" style="s2">collectively and when we collectively</p>
<p begin="01:59:21.490" end="01:59:26.680" style="s2">embrace this mythology this myth right</p>
<p begin="01:59:24.400" end="01:59:28.739" style="s2">that we are all created equal it</p>
<p begin="01:59:26.680" end="01:59:30.840" style="s2">provides a better fucking world</p>
<p begin="01:59:28.739" end="01:59:33.119" style="s2">it provides a better cut more food on</p>
<p begin="01:59:30.840" end="01:59:35.429" style="s2">the table more equality more diverse</p>
<p begin="01:59:33.119" end="01:59:37.019" style="s2">more interesting culture and ultimately</p>
<p begin="01:59:35.429" end="01:59:39.780" style="s2">a stronger culture because we&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="01:59:37.019" end="01:59:40.800" style="s2">creative so that&#39;s a truth so so even</p>
<p begin="01:59:39.780" end="01:59:43.710" style="s2">though I can disprove it mathematically</p>
<p begin="01:59:40.800" end="01:59:46.409" style="s2">Obama biologically for whatever reason</p>

<p begin="01:59:46.409" end="01:59:51.989" style="s2">sweeter fruit so one of that what if</p>
<p begin="01:59:50.070" end="01:59:53.820" style="s2">that crazy idea thank you you&#39;ve L</p>
<p begin="01:59:51.989" end="01:59:55.980" style="s2">Harare by the way for bringing that to</p>

<p begin="02:00:00.809" end="02:00:04.769" style="s2">sam Harris where&#39;s your dude okay</p>
<p begin="02:00:03.119" end="02:00:08.130" style="s2">fighting and that&#39;s what that was</p>
<p begin="02:00:04.769" end="02:00:10.019" style="s2">I was like Sam you know yeah you back</p>
<p begin="02:00:08.130" end="02:00:12.269" style="s2">Sam you back to Jordan in that I I</p>
<p begin="02:00:10.019" end="02:00:14.309" style="s2">thought they both got mired down and I</p>
<p begin="02:00:12.269" end="02:00:16.320" style="s2">liked them both very yeah but I do think</p>
<p begin="02:00:14.309" end="02:00:18.090" style="s2">that Sam kept putting this flag there</p>
<p begin="02:00:16.320" end="02:00:20.039" style="s2">and couldn&#39;t move on well saying I</p>
<p begin="02:00:18.090" end="02:00:21.929" style="s2">understood what Jordan was saying though</p>
<p begin="02:00:20.039" end="02:00:24.119" style="s2">so let&#39;s just recapitulate for the for</p>
<p begin="02:00:21.929" end="02:00:27.539" style="s2">the folks at so my recollection correct</p>
<p begin="02:00:24.119" end="02:00:31.110" style="s2">me if this isn&#39;t yours is that Sam was</p>
<p begin="02:00:27.539" end="02:00:32.849" style="s2">trying to say that truth was very</p>
<p begin="02:00:31.110" end="02:00:35.159" style="s2">important and Jordan was trying to say</p>
<p begin="02:00:32.849" end="02:00:37.650" style="s2">if something doesn&#39;t contribute to human</p>
<p begin="02:00:35.159" end="02:00:40.499" style="s2">fitness then in some sense it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:00:37.650" end="02:00:42.539" style="s2">true little bit different so I think</p>
<p begin="02:00:40.499" end="02:00:45.630" style="s2">what&#39;s what Jordan was saying is there</p>
<p begin="02:00:42.539" end="02:00:48.929" style="s2">are truths that would that that there</p>
<p begin="02:00:45.630" end="02:00:51.840" style="s2">are say scientific truths that if we</p>
<p begin="02:00:48.929" end="02:00:53.519" style="s2">followed through with what he said was</p>
<p begin="02:00:51.840" end="02:00:55.380" style="s2">yes we would we would extinguish the</p>
<p begin="02:00:53.519" end="02:00:58.789" style="s2">world right and that&#39;s not a that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:00:55.380" end="02:01:02.070" style="s2">that&#39;s so that that&#39;s not a truth that</p>
<p begin="02:00:58.789" end="02:01:05.010" style="s2">so he was trying to marry truth with</p>
<p begin="02:01:02.070" end="02:01:07.349" style="s2">Fitness is it Fitness or with with with</p>
<p begin="02:01:05.010" end="02:01:10.739" style="s2">that well the I guess positivity</p>
<p begin="02:01:07.349" end="02:01:11.940" style="s2">something so yeah I don&#39;t wanna be</p>
<p begin="02:01:10.739" end="02:01:13.710" style="s2">unfair to Jordan because no I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="02:01:11.940" end="02:01:15.210" style="s2">been unfair to either one of them but at</p>
<p begin="02:01:13.710" end="02:01:16.980" style="s2">what I was looking to get was your</p>
<p begin="02:01:15.210" end="02:01:20.130" style="s2">actual insight in something that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:01:16.980" end="02:01:23.070" style="s2">struggled with on Sam&#39;s show I said I</p>
<p begin="02:01:20.130" end="02:01:25.230" style="s2">can reduce most of what I care about or</p>
<p begin="02:01:23.070" end="02:01:27.659" style="s2">perhaps all of it to for different</p>
<p begin="02:01:25.230" end="02:01:30.179" style="s2">values that compete with each other and</p>
<p begin="02:01:27.659" end="02:01:33.059" style="s2">I said it&#39;s truth meaning fitness and</p>
<p begin="02:01:30.179" end="02:01:35.789" style="s2">grace so there are things that are true</p>
<p begin="02:01:33.059" end="02:01:37.079" style="s2">that Rob my life of meaning and so I</p>
<p begin="02:01:35.789" end="02:01:39.479" style="s2">have to trade off between them there are</p>
<p begin="02:01:37.079" end="02:01:41.550" style="s2">things that are true that might be less</p>
<p begin="02:01:39.479" end="02:01:42.660" style="s2">fit like you discover some way of</p>
<p begin="02:01:41.550" end="02:01:43.950" style="s2">blowing the world</p>
<p begin="02:01:42.660" end="02:01:46.200" style="s2">that&#39;s very cheap in any high school</p>
<p begin="02:01:43.950" end="02:01:49.050" style="s2">student could do it that would decrease</p>
<p begin="02:01:46.200" end="02:01:51.060" style="s2">human fitness and then there are things</p>
<p begin="02:01:49.050" end="02:01:53.070" style="s2">that are true that are not graceful that</p>
<p begin="02:01:51.060" end="02:01:56.220" style="s2">are not beautiful that that I&#39;d wish</p>
<p begin="02:01:53.070" end="02:01:57.510" style="s2">were not true and well you know but you</p>
<p begin="02:01:56.220" end="02:01:59.670" style="s2">don&#39;t need to talked about this</p>
<p begin="02:01:57.510" end="02:02:02.100" style="s2">Nisha talked about the idea of plural</p>
<p begin="02:01:59.670" end="02:02:03.390" style="s2">truths okay I mean when I when a chemist</p>
<p begin="02:02:02.100" end="02:02:04.920" style="s2">looks at a painting when you look at a</p>
<p begin="02:02:03.390" end="02:02:06.090" style="s2">beautiful painting like the Sistine</p>
<p begin="02:02:04.920" end="02:02:07.920" style="s2">Chapel or something it brings you to</p>
<p begin="02:02:06.090" end="02:02:09.630" style="s2">your knees right a chemist&#39;s could also</p>
<p begin="02:02:07.920" end="02:02:11.430" style="s2">say well what you see what you think is</p>
<p begin="02:02:09.630" end="02:02:14.340" style="s2">blue is actually not blue your eyes or</p>
<p begin="02:02:11.430" end="02:02:15.840" style="s2">that&#39;s a trick that your eye is playing</p>
<p begin="02:02:14.340" end="02:02:17.970" style="s2">and their bid there&#39;d be truth to that</p>
<p begin="02:02:15.840" end="02:02:20.280" style="s2">as well which is you take the take the</p>
<p begin="02:02:17.970" end="02:02:22.800" style="s2">David with its famous distortions of</p>
<p begin="02:02:20.280" end="02:02:25.050" style="s2">form Michelangelo&#39;s David only works</p>
<p begin="02:02:22.800" end="02:02:27.570" style="s2">because it is in fact not truly a human</p>
<p begin="02:02:25.050" end="02:02:29.880" style="s2">form it&#39;s a distorted form that is</p>
<p begin="02:02:27.570" end="02:02:31.920" style="s2">reprocessed to be perfect right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:02:29.880" end="02:02:33.690" style="s2">right another another way to look at it</p>
<p begin="02:02:31.920" end="02:02:36.090" style="s2">let&#39;s just take dogs for example yeah</p>
<p begin="02:02:33.690" end="02:02:39.480" style="s2">it&#39;s true the dogs are scavengers pack</p>
<p begin="02:02:36.090" end="02:02:41.010" style="s2">animals and hunters and it&#39;s also true</p>
<p begin="02:02:39.480" end="02:02:43.350" style="s2">that they&#39;ve probably evolved to</p>
<p begin="02:02:41.010" end="02:02:45.680" style="s2">manipulate you with their little wags</p>
<p begin="02:02:43.350" end="02:02:48.150" style="s2">and their ears down to the scheming</p>
<p begin="02:02:45.680" end="02:02:51.420" style="s2">scheming they&#39;re fucking manipulating</p>
<p begin="02:02:48.150" end="02:02:56.160" style="s2">right right okay great it&#39;s also true</p>
<p begin="02:02:51.420" end="02:02:57.990" style="s2">that dogs are awesome yes when they die</p>
<p begin="02:02:56.160" end="02:03:00.720" style="s2">I cry so hard I can&#39;t okay but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="02:02:57.990" end="02:03:02.280" style="s2">this that&#39;s true - there&#39;s room for all</p>
<p begin="02:03:00.720" end="02:03:05.370" style="s2">these well let&#39;s see but I don&#39;t I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:03:02.280" end="02:03:07.410" style="s2">like this I love the idea that there are</p>
<p begin="02:03:05.370" end="02:03:10.440" style="s2">things that actually I&#39;m willing to</p>
<p begin="02:03:07.410" end="02:03:11.850" style="s2">sacrifice truth for so you&#39;re saying it</p>
<p begin="02:03:10.440" end="02:03:13.620" style="s2">one way Jordan say my name say I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:03:11.850" end="02:03:15.600" style="s2">saying what I&#39;m trying to they could</p>
<p begin="02:03:13.620" end="02:03:17.220" style="s2">have let go of that because they would</p>
<p begin="02:03:15.600" end="02:03:18.690" style="s2">have got they got mired down they did</p>
<p begin="02:03:17.220" end="02:03:20.190" style="s2">and then they had that that you know I</p>
<p begin="02:03:18.690" end="02:03:23.370" style="s2">remember Sam&#39;s agonizing should I do a</p>
<p begin="02:03:20.190" end="02:03:25.410" style="s2">redo yeah what I get out of it then and</p>
<p begin="02:03:23.370" end="02:03:26.640" style="s2">this is an uncomfortable place to be but</p>
<p begin="02:03:25.410" end="02:03:28.050" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:03:26.640" end="02:03:29.580" style="s2">uncomfortable to your point about what</p>
<p begin="02:03:28.050" end="02:03:30.570" style="s2">to mine in order to get to comedy so I</p>
<p begin="02:03:29.580" end="02:03:34.740" style="s2">maybe I&#39;m just trying to get to a</p>
<p begin="02:03:30.570" end="02:03:36.780" style="s2">podcast is why did you imagine the truth</p>
<p begin="02:03:34.740" end="02:03:39.240" style="s2">was going to be a great guide to</p>
<p begin="02:03:36.780" end="02:03:40.800" style="s2">everything else in other words why would</p>
<p begin="02:03:39.240" end="02:03:42.120" style="s2">you imagine the truth wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="02:03:40.800" end="02:03:44.520" style="s2">something that you might have to give up</p>
<p begin="02:03:42.120" end="02:03:46.860" style="s2">a little bit to get a better outcome I</p>
<p begin="02:03:44.520" end="02:03:49.470" style="s2">don&#39;t believe that the Supreme Court is</p>
<p begin="02:03:46.860" end="02:03:51.210" style="s2">the nine wisest druids just because they</p>
<p begin="02:03:49.470" end="02:03:53.670" style="s2">wear black robes but on the other hand</p>
<p begin="02:03:51.210" end="02:03:55.770" style="s2">maybe I get a really better outcome if I</p>
<p begin="02:03:53.670" end="02:03:56.229" style="s2">learn how to suspend disbelief when I go</p>
<p begin="02:03:55.770" end="02:03:58.300" style="s2">to the</p>
<p begin="02:03:56.229" end="02:04:00.400" style="s2">Court which I&#39;ve attended once just the</p>
<p begin="02:03:58.300" end="02:04:02.289" style="s2">way when I go to a movie yeah you know</p>
<p begin="02:04:00.400" end="02:04:04.479" style="s2">transport me take me away make me</p>
<p begin="02:04:02.289" end="02:04:07.360" style="s2">believe that this is in fact true yeah</p>
<p begin="02:04:04.479" end="02:04:08.619" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s true I mean</p>
<p begin="02:04:07.360" end="02:04:10.239" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s very true there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="02:04:08.619" end="02:04:11.530" style="s2">there again it goes back to these plural</p>
<p begin="02:04:10.239" end="02:04:12.849" style="s2">truths it depends on where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:04:11.530" end="02:04:14.979" style="s2">standing in the question you&#39;re asking</p>
<p begin="02:04:12.849" end="02:04:17.619" style="s2">baby you know they&#39;re all these sort of</p>
<p begin="02:04:14.979" end="02:04:19.929" style="s2">different variations on it but sometimes</p>
<p begin="02:04:17.619" end="02:04:21.820" style="s2">something can be true very true for you</p>
<p begin="02:04:19.929" end="02:04:24.280" style="s2">right then and there I mean it may make</p>
<p begin="02:04:21.820" end="02:04:24.610" style="s2">no sense but oh I&#39;m just having a great</p>
<p begin="02:04:24.280" end="02:04:27.729" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="02:04:24.610" end="02:04:29.199" style="s2">yeah or fuck I love you yeah and then</p>
<p begin="02:04:27.729" end="02:04:30.219" style="s2">you get linear then you have time to</p>
<p begin="02:04:29.199" end="02:04:33.219" style="s2">think about it&#39;s like I was gonna buy</p>
<p begin="02:04:30.219" end="02:04:36.219" style="s2">that car I asked that person to marry me</p>
<p begin="02:04:33.219" end="02:04:40.119" style="s2">but I really felt it in the moment maybe</p>
<p begin="02:04:36.219" end="02:04:41.349" style="s2">that&#39;s just my biology talking but yeah</p>
<p begin="02:04:40.119" end="02:04:43.090" style="s2">I think there are different levels</p>
<p begin="02:04:41.349" end="02:04:44.769" style="s2">they&#39;re their truths with a capital T</p>
<p begin="02:04:43.090" end="02:04:47.079" style="s2">and they&#39;re smaller truths maybe they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:04:44.769" end="02:04:48.429" style="s2">illusions but I like the illusion well I</p>
<p begin="02:04:47.079" end="02:04:50.979" style="s2">mean I think that one of the things you</p>
<p begin="02:04:48.429" end="02:04:52.539" style="s2">can point to just the way the way you</p>
<p begin="02:04:50.979" end="02:04:54.489" style="s2">talked about why do people get carried</p>
<p begin="02:04:52.539" end="02:04:56.739" style="s2">away and end up in Vegas marrying each</p>
<p begin="02:04:54.489" end="02:04:59.400" style="s2">other is that in some sense maybe our</p>
<p begin="02:04:56.739" end="02:05:02.349" style="s2">biology knows that we can&#39;t trust our</p>
<p begin="02:04:59.400" end="02:05:05.619" style="s2">rational mind and that if we don&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="02:05:02.349" end="02:05:08.170" style="s2">swept away that one of the reasons that</p>
<p begin="02:05:05.619" end="02:05:12.130" style="s2">these impulses are so hard to explain is</p>
<p begin="02:05:08.170" end="02:05:14.860" style="s2">is that biology has designed this drive</p>
<p begin="02:05:12.130" end="02:05:17.289" style="s2">to reproduce to be almost suicidal that</p>
<p begin="02:05:14.860" end="02:05:19.090" style="s2">you&#39;re willing to sacrifice you know if</p>
<p begin="02:05:17.289" end="02:05:21.190" style="s2">you think about it in terms of biology</p>
<p begin="02:05:19.090" end="02:05:22.929" style="s2">you have soma which doesn&#39;t reproduce</p>
<p begin="02:05:21.190" end="02:05:24.820" style="s2">and you have germ lines like your what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:05:22.929" end="02:05:27.159" style="s2">between your legs that has a hope of</p>
<p begin="02:05:24.820" end="02:05:30.670" style="s2">immortality and you have to make sure</p>
<p begin="02:05:27.159" end="02:05:32.829" style="s2">that the soma is overwhelmed by the need</p>
<p begin="02:05:30.670" end="02:05:35.860" style="s2">to perpetuate the germ and so in fact</p>
<p begin="02:05:32.829" end="02:05:38.679" style="s2">we&#39;re born to be self-destructive and</p>
<p begin="02:05:35.860" end="02:05:41.739" style="s2">irrational in our somatic selves because</p>
<p begin="02:05:38.679" end="02:05:43.300" style="s2">it is our line that in some sense has to</p>
<p begin="02:05:41.739" end="02:05:46.030" style="s2">live forever yeah you&#39;re a series of</p>

<p begin="02:07:27.180" end="02:07:31.590" style="s2">know when you were talking on Rogen</p>
<p begin="02:07:28.560" end="02:07:33.030" style="s2">about how you like leaving this world</p>
<p begin="02:07:31.590" end="02:07:35.460" style="s2">and you like you&#39;re in a world of ideas</p>
<p begin="02:07:33.030" end="02:07:37.320" style="s2">I just I haven&#39;t stopped thinking about</p>
<p begin="02:07:35.460" end="02:07:42.120" style="s2">it I have not stopped thinking about</p>
<p begin="02:07:37.320" end="02:07:44.370" style="s2">what you said and and and so you are</p>
<p begin="02:07:42.120" end="02:07:46.260" style="s2">eminently qualified to simplify these</p>
<p begin="02:07:44.370" end="02:07:47.910" style="s2">ideas and turn them into something</p>
<p begin="02:07:46.260" end="02:07:49.770" style="s2">beautiful if that&#39;s true and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:07:47.910" end="02:07:51.450" style="s2">know that it maybe it&#39;s me it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:07:49.770" end="02:07:53.490" style="s2">challenge or it&#39;s a challenge but but if</p>
<p begin="02:07:51.450" end="02:07:56.580" style="s2">it&#39;s true it has to do with a very weird</p>
<p begin="02:07:53.490" end="02:07:58.830" style="s2">thing I think which is that symbols were</p>
<p begin="02:07:56.580" end="02:08:00.870" style="s2">not really available to me as a language</p>
<p begin="02:07:58.830" end="02:08:02.970" style="s2">because of my learning issues they sort</p>
<p begin="02:08:00.870" end="02:08:04.830" style="s2">of they they play around and they jump</p>
<p begin="02:08:02.970" end="02:08:06.570" style="s2">here and there and I can&#39;t really read</p>
<p begin="02:08:04.830" end="02:08:10.200" style="s2">equations just the way I can&#39;t read</p>
<p begin="02:08:06.570" end="02:08:13.680" style="s2">music and so for me what happened was I</p>
<p begin="02:08:10.200" end="02:08:15.690" style="s2">had to find some other route up the</p>
<p begin="02:08:13.680" end="02:08:17.670" style="s2">mountain because the symbolic route was</p>
<p begin="02:08:15.690" end="02:08:20.460" style="s2">blocked off to me you got to make it</p>
<p begin="02:08:17.670" end="02:08:22.890" style="s2">relevant so so why I always say to</p>
<p begin="02:08:20.460" end="02:08:24.990" style="s2">people who are not who haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:08:22.890" end="02:08:27.030" style="s2">gone down the education road I always</p>
<p begin="02:08:24.990" end="02:08:28.170" style="s2">say I use these little things too young</p>
<p begin="02:08:27.030" end="02:08:29.760" style="s2">man I know how to talk to them I go</p>
<p begin="02:08:28.170" end="02:08:31.110" style="s2">education is good you know why and they</p>
<p begin="02:08:29.760" end="02:08:32.820" style="s2">say why go because it teaches the</p>
<p begin="02:08:31.110" end="02:08:36.900" style="s2">difference between a good idea and a bad</p>
<p begin="02:08:32.820" end="02:08:38.490" style="s2">idea yeah and then I say you should</p>
<p begin="02:08:36.900" end="02:08:39.900" style="s2">study some math what the fuck math</p>
<p begin="02:08:38.490" end="02:08:42.180" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing to listen study some</p>
<p begin="02:08:39.900" end="02:08:44.010" style="s2">geometry algebra why why you know well</p>
<p begin="02:08:42.180" end="02:08:45.630" style="s2">because it teaches you how to think and</p>
<p begin="02:08:44.010" end="02:08:47.160" style="s2">they go what does that man go teach you</p>

<p begin="02:09:42.480" end="02:09:47.910" style="s2">said look in the in the mansion of</p>
<p begin="02:09:44.340" end="02:09:51.570" style="s2">science you find three groups of people</p>
<p begin="02:09:47.910" end="02:09:55.590" style="s2">he says the first is the craftsmen and</p>
<p begin="02:09:51.570" end="02:09:57.630" style="s2">the craftsmen are largely there because</p>
<p begin="02:09:55.590" end="02:10:00.450" style="s2">they enjoy the beauty of the</p>
<p begin="02:09:57.630" end="02:10:02.940" style="s2">construction and the purity of it he</p>
<p begin="02:10:00.450" end="02:10:04.740" style="s2">says then you find the competitors and</p>
<p begin="02:10:02.940" end="02:10:06.810" style="s2">they&#39;re there because science makes for</p>
<p begin="02:10:04.740" end="02:10:09.750" style="s2">a great game with which to beat each</p>
<p begin="02:10:06.810" end="02:10:11.430" style="s2">other and contest I says there&#39;s a third</p>
<p begin="02:10:09.750" end="02:10:15.510" style="s2">group which is the smallest of the three</p>
<p begin="02:10:11.430" end="02:10:18.150" style="s2">and he said that group is the searchers</p>
<p begin="02:10:15.510" end="02:10:19.620" style="s2">and they don&#39;t do most of the work he</p>
<p begin="02:10:18.150" end="02:10:21.870" style="s2">said the only thing about the searchers</p>
<p begin="02:10:19.620" end="02:10:24.240" style="s2">is that the mansion wouldn&#39;t be there if</p>
<p begin="02:10:21.870" end="02:10:26.850" style="s2">not for them and it&#39;s just this it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:10:24.240" end="02:10:28.560" style="s2">like a gambit gives you put like these</p>
<p begin="02:10:26.850" end="02:10:30.000" style="s2">guys this is all that matters to me like</p>
<p begin="02:10:28.560" end="02:10:32.340" style="s2">when I hear that when you just use that</p>
<p begin="02:10:30.000" end="02:10:34.080" style="s2">metaphor but this is fuck how can you</p>
<p begin="02:10:32.340" end="02:10:35.369" style="s2">not be a searcher the problem is that</p>
<p begin="02:10:34.080" end="02:10:37.530" style="s2">I&#39;ll never be happy because I&#39;m not</p>

<p begin="02:10:37.530" end="02:10:40.739" style="s2">like the great jazz musicians you ever</p>
<p begin="02:10:39.090" end="02:10:43.199" style="s2">everything was Albert Murray who who</p>
<p begin="02:10:40.739" end="02:10:44.489" style="s2">spoke about the difference in and you</p>
<p begin="02:10:43.199" end="02:10:46.050" style="s2">hear this for you but that was a dog</p>
<p begin="02:10:44.489" end="02:10:47.460" style="s2">whistle that you just pulled like the</p>
<p begin="02:10:46.050" end="02:10:48.239" style="s2">fact that you brought up a Louis</p>
<p begin="02:10:47.460" end="02:10:50.429" style="s2">Armstrong</p>
<p begin="02:10:48.239" end="02:10:53.489" style="s2">yeah Louis Armstrong is captured in our</p>
<p begin="02:10:50.429" end="02:10:55.800" style="s2">public imagination as a novelty singer</p>
<p begin="02:10:53.489" end="02:10:58.170" style="s2">as opposed to the greatest genius that</p>
<p begin="02:10:55.800" end="02:11:01.409" style="s2">jazz ever produced his wing like he</p>
<p begin="02:10:58.170" end="02:11:03.960" style="s2">invented real modern jazz more almost</p>
<p begin="02:11:01.409" end="02:11:06.030" style="s2">single-handed he could do again the</p>
<p begin="02:11:03.960" end="02:11:09.449" style="s2">great the great ones like this like</p>
<p begin="02:11:06.030" end="02:11:11.790" style="s2">Charlie Parker and like they would they</p>
<p begin="02:11:09.449" end="02:11:13.440" style="s2">would they they knew their notes there</p>
<p begin="02:11:11.790" end="02:11:16.139" style="s2">was the song and then they would go off</p>
<p begin="02:11:13.440" end="02:11:18.810" style="s2">they would they would improv of probably</p>
<p begin="02:11:16.139" end="02:11:20.670" style="s2">here automatically and come back to the</p>
<p begin="02:11:18.810" end="02:11:22.500" style="s2">theme they&#39;d find their way back I mean</p>
<p begin="02:11:20.670" end="02:11:24.000" style="s2">that&#39;s the whole point of stand-up the</p>
<p begin="02:11:22.500" end="02:11:26.849" style="s2">point of any kind of self-expression</p>
<p begin="02:11:24.000" end="02:11:28.500" style="s2">living in that danger zone inspiration</p>
<p begin="02:11:26.849" end="02:11:30.510" style="s2">doing something you didn&#39;t think you</p>

<p begin="02:11:30.510" end="02:11:34.349" style="s2">thing in the Karate Kid I remember when</p>

<p begin="02:12:10.199" end="02:12:17.570" style="s2">to find some way for you free you and me</p>
<p begin="02:12:12.780" end="02:12:21.810" style="s2">to explore some relatively difficult</p>
<p begin="02:12:17.570" end="02:12:23.400" style="s2">scientific ideas together correct to see</p>
<p begin="02:12:21.810" end="02:12:25.500" style="s2">whether or not we could make great audio</p>
<p begin="02:12:23.400" end="02:12:27.150" style="s2">and video out of out of it because the</p>
<p begin="02:12:25.500" end="02:12:30.810" style="s2">thing that will be most meaningful for</p>
<p begin="02:12:27.150" end="02:12:32.580" style="s2">me is if some of the really gorgeous</p>
<p begin="02:12:30.810" end="02:12:35.790" style="s2">stuff and you know we both are talking</p>
<p begin="02:12:32.580" end="02:12:38.219" style="s2">about the the craft and the emotion and</p>
<p begin="02:12:35.790" end="02:12:40.260" style="s2">the thing is is that if this doesn&#39;t end</p>
<p begin="02:12:38.219" end="02:12:42.090" style="s2">up producing some amount of</p>
<p begin="02:12:40.260" end="02:12:43.739" style="s2">transcendence and let&#39;s be honest most</p>
<p begin="02:12:42.090" end="02:12:45.449" style="s2">of these episodes that I&#39;m gonna do are</p>
<p begin="02:12:43.739" end="02:12:48.750" style="s2">not going to get to the level of</p>
<p begin="02:12:45.449" end="02:12:51.120" style="s2">transcendence that I&#39;m looking for but</p>
<p begin="02:12:48.750" end="02:12:52.920" style="s2">if we can do something to push out the</p>
<p begin="02:12:51.120" end="02:12:54.720" style="s2">best stuff that people don&#39;t know is</p>
<p begin="02:12:52.920" end="02:12:56.610" style="s2">there the symphonies that are sitting</p>
<p begin="02:12:54.720" end="02:12:59.370" style="s2">there and I always make this analogy as</p>
<p begin="02:12:56.610" end="02:13:01.170" style="s2">sheet music that is never performed like</p>
<p begin="02:12:59.370" end="02:13:03.780" style="s2">that&#39;s how I view academic papers so</p>
<p begin="02:13:01.170" end="02:13:06.180" style="s2">many of these things are symphonic and</p>
<p begin="02:13:03.780" end="02:13:07.650" style="s2">they there&#39;s no public performance that</p>
<p begin="02:13:06.180" end="02:13:10.080" style="s2">allows you to say oh that&#39;s what those</p>
<p begin="02:13:07.650" end="02:13:11.700" style="s2">people were dealing with oh my god is</p>
<p begin="02:13:10.080" end="02:13:13.950" style="s2">that really part of our world is that</p>
<p begin="02:13:11.700" end="02:13:16.830" style="s2">really known and settled it&#39;s amazing</p>
<p begin="02:13:13.950" end="02:13:19.140" style="s2">yeah I would be very moved because I</p>
<p begin="02:13:16.830" end="02:13:21.690" style="s2">think you&#39;ve got a mind like almost</p>
<p begin="02:13:19.140" end="02:13:23.730" style="s2">nobody I&#39;ve ever met in terms of range</p>
<p begin="02:13:21.690" end="02:13:26.670" style="s2">conversational ability and the ability</p>
<p begin="02:13:23.730" end="02:13:29.150" style="s2">to also just emotionally and in</p>
<p begin="02:13:26.670" end="02:13:31.290" style="s2">analytically touch a subject</p>
<p begin="02:13:29.150" end="02:13:33.060" style="s2">simultaneously without one displacing</p>
<p begin="02:13:31.290" end="02:13:35.270" style="s2">the other bees coming from America</p>
<p begin="02:13:33.060" end="02:13:37.650" style="s2">Weinstein that&#39;s a huge compliment but</p>
<p begin="02:13:35.270" end="02:13:40.110" style="s2">you know I don&#39;t know but yeah I&#39;d love</p>

<p begin="02:13:41.190" end="02:13:44.370" style="s2">talking about coming up with a</p>
<p begin="02:13:42.320" end="02:13:47.220" style="s2">complicated will end with this but come</p>
<p begin="02:13:44.370" end="02:13:49.650" style="s2">here with a complicated mathematical you</p>
<p begin="02:13:47.220" end="02:13:51.410" style="s2">know it&#39;s okay you know just discussing</p>

<p begin="02:13:51.410" end="02:13:57.600" style="s2">you know a complicated scientific idea I</p>
<p begin="02:13:54.900" end="02:14:00.210" style="s2">was thinking about when Socrates was</p>
<p begin="02:13:57.600" end="02:14:02.340" style="s2">trying to prove the the existence of the</p>
<p begin="02:14:00.210" end="02:14:04.290" style="s2">soul in the notion that we are all</p>
<p begin="02:14:02.340" end="02:14:06.480" style="s2">immortal and have been here forever he</p>
<p begin="02:14:04.290" end="02:14:08.640" style="s2">took the two slave voice and asked them</p>
<p begin="02:14:06.480" end="02:14:09.870" style="s2">a complicated mathematical question and</p>
<p begin="02:14:08.640" end="02:14:11.370" style="s2">one kid he asked a series of questions</p>
<p begin="02:14:09.870" end="02:14:12.960" style="s2">and couldn&#39;t get the answer and another</p>
<p begin="02:14:11.370" end="02:14:15.510" style="s2">kid they were both 11 or something and</p>
<p begin="02:14:12.960" end="02:14:17.550" style="s2">asked him the questions and and got the</p>
<p begin="02:14:15.510" end="02:14:18.900" style="s2">answer after led him to the answer</p>
<p begin="02:14:17.550" end="02:14:20.430" style="s2">through a series of questions and he</p>
<p begin="02:14:18.900" end="02:14:23.100" style="s2">said I think it was Timmy knows the</p>
<p begin="02:14:20.430" end="02:14:25.560" style="s2">great mathematic mathematician and in</p>
<p begin="02:14:23.100" end="02:14:28.470" style="s2">you know in Athens he said now do you</p>
<p begin="02:14:25.560" end="02:14:30.630" style="s2">see that this boy souls not been here</p>
<p begin="02:14:28.470" end="02:14:33.720" style="s2">long enough so he didn&#39;t have the answer</p>
<p begin="02:14:30.630" end="02:14:35.610" style="s2">in his soul but this boy had the answer</p>
<p begin="02:14:33.720" end="02:14:37.140" style="s2">and I just had to ask it out of him</p>
<p begin="02:14:35.610" end="02:14:39.840" style="s2">therefore his soul has been around</p>
<p begin="02:14:37.140" end="02:14:41.550" style="s2">longer like see so the point is we&#39;re</p>
