<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:04.080" style="s2">hey folks Bret here I wanted to take a</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.280" end="00:00:06.089" style="s2">crack at analyzing the steven crowder</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.080" end="00:00:08.309" style="s2">situation for those who don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.089" end="00:00:09.840" style="s2">Crowder has a very popular YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.309" end="00:00:11.670" style="s2">channel with more than three million</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.840" end="00:00:14.400" style="s2">subscribers which was recently</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.670" end="00:00:15.839" style="s2">demonetised by Google for what it said</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.400" end="00:00:19.590" style="s2">for violations of its Terms of Service</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.839" end="00:00:21.150" style="s2">in particular Crowder mocked Fox</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.590" end="00:00:23.550" style="s2">reporter Carlos Massa</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.150" end="00:00:26.670" style="s2">who is gay and he did so in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.550" end="00:00:28.710" style="s2">was quite mean-spirited now many have</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.670" end="00:00:30.269" style="s2">pointed out that others have done far</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.710" end="00:00:32.329" style="s2">worse on YouTube and not had their</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.269" end="00:00:34.980" style="s2">channels d monetized so what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.329" end="00:00:37.500" style="s2">well the key concept is selective</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.980" end="00:00:40.710" style="s2">enforcement or what I call the principle</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.500" end="00:00:42.989" style="s2">of the low posted speed limit you can</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.710" end="00:00:44.969" style="s2">imagine a town in which a speed limit</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.989" end="00:00:47.030" style="s2">was posted so low that people routinely</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.969" end="00:00:49.710" style="s2">violated as they pass through town and</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.030" end="00:00:51.750" style="s2">the enforcement authority can decide if</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.710" end="00:00:54.030" style="s2">it wants to pull over black people or</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.750" end="00:00:56.640" style="s2">gay people or Jews or hippies or</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.030" end="00:00:58.680" style="s2">whatever it doesn&#39;t like the law itself</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.640" end="00:01:02.280" style="s2">isn&#39;t biased but the enforcement makes</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.680" end="00:01:05.939" style="s2">it as if it were so in one sense because</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.280" end="00:01:07.680" style="s2">Crowder is such a big target he is</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.939" end="00:01:10.229" style="s2">facing a kind of enforcement that may</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.680" end="00:01:12.479" style="s2">not be seen elsewhere now there is an</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.229" end="00:01:15.570" style="s2">important issue here which has to do</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.479" end="00:01:18.960" style="s2">with the question of speech is steven</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.570" end="00:01:21.180" style="s2">crowder engaged in an act of free speech</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.960" end="00:01:23.580" style="s2">that is in some way protected well</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.180" end="00:01:25.500" style="s2">technically not the First Amendment does</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.580" end="00:01:27.900" style="s2">not apply to Google because Google is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.500" end="00:01:30.240" style="s2">private corporation on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.900" end="00:01:32.850" style="s2">the First Amendment was designed to</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.240" end="00:01:35.130" style="s2">protect free expression the reason that</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.850" end="00:01:36.630" style="s2">it is very specifically limited to</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.130" end="00:01:38.549" style="s2">governmental interference is that the</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.630" end="00:01:41.670" style="s2">founders in particular feared</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.549" end="00:01:43.439" style="s2">governmental tyranny we don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.670" end="00:01:46.409" style="s2">they would have thought about tech</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.439" end="00:01:48.750" style="s2">platforms but my guess is the very same</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.409" end="00:01:51.060" style="s2">logic that led them to build multiple</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.750" end="00:01:55.020" style="s2">protections into the US Constitution</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.060" end="00:01:57.420" style="s2">against government overreach would have</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.020" end="00:01:59.579" style="s2">caused them if they had understood the</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.420" end="00:02:01.110" style="s2">way Silicon Valley would function to</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.579" end="00:02:02.640" style="s2">protect us also from these tech</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.110" end="00:02:05.670" style="s2">platforms and their disproportionate</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.640" end="00:02:07.590" style="s2">power but the founders were simply not</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.670" end="00:02:09.300" style="s2">gods and they couldn&#39;t look forward in</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.590" end="00:02:11.370" style="s2">such a way and so they left us with a</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.300" end="00:02:12.660" style="s2">situation in which we know what they</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.370" end="00:02:14.700" style="s2">were trying to protect us</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.660" end="00:02:16.650" style="s2">but the map they gave us was not</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.700" end="00:02:19.350" style="s2">sufficient to do the job in the 21st</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.650" end="00:02:20.940" style="s2">century we should also recognize when we</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.350" end="00:02:23.370" style="s2">talk about these corporations that they</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.940" end="00:02:25.260" style="s2">are not one thing in fact we can</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.370" end="00:02:28.140" style="s2">recognize several different layers at</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.260" end="00:02:30.720" style="s2">work in these processes there is the</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.140" end="00:02:33.990" style="s2">speech layer the part of Twitter or</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.720" end="00:02:37.110" style="s2">YouTube where we the public talk to each</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.990" end="00:02:40.260" style="s2">other there is the algorithm layer which</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.110" end="00:02:42.990" style="s2">decides what we see is in general</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.260" end="00:02:45.900" style="s2">functioning in an automatic way but it</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.990" end="00:02:48.360" style="s2">may be climbed to have certain biases</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.900" end="00:02:50.400" style="s2">within it and then there&#39;s the corporate</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.360" end="00:02:52.680" style="s2">layer where something that we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.400" end="00:02:54.770" style="s2">engage with talks to itself and decides</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.680" end="00:02:57.650" style="s2">what it is trying to accomplish</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.770" end="00:03:01.050" style="s2">presumably the corporate layer is</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.650" end="00:03:04.170" style="s2">divided there may be a big difference</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.050" end="00:03:05.940" style="s2">between the people who are attempting to</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.170" end="00:03:09.480" style="s2">steer the corporation in the direction</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.940" end="00:03:11.550" style="s2">of profitability and let&#39;s say the truth</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.480" end="00:03:13.140" style="s2">and safety committee within the</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.550" end="00:03:15.690" style="s2">corporation that may have a different</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.140" end="00:03:17.400" style="s2">agenda unfortunately we don&#39;t get much</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.690" end="00:03:19.290" style="s2">of a window into the discussion between</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.400" end="00:03:22.680" style="s2">those two layers but it is worth keeping</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.290" end="00:03:25.680" style="s2">in mind that as Google takes action it</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.680" end="00:03:28.110" style="s2">may not be of one mind let us assume for</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.680" end="00:03:31.020" style="s2">the moment that most of us believe in</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.110" end="00:03:33.240" style="s2">the concept not only of free speech but</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.020" end="00:03:36.060" style="s2">in the value that is being protected by</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.240" end="00:03:39.240" style="s2">the First Amendment free expression some</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.060" end="00:03:41.100" style="s2">of us have been cast as free speech</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.240" end="00:03:43.890" style="s2">absolutist and in fact I&#39;ve used that</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.100" end="00:03:46.140" style="s2">term with reference to myself others</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.890" end="00:03:48.000" style="s2">like my brother Eric Weinstein has</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.140" end="00:03:49.770" style="s2">argued he&#39;s not a free speech absolutist</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.000" end="00:03:53.280" style="s2">because he is concerned about certain</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.770" end="00:03:56.550" style="s2">things that might be protected by such a</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.280" end="00:03:59.640" style="s2">none nuanced view now we can debate the</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.550" end="00:04:02.850" style="s2">merits of free speech absolutism but</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.640" end="00:04:06.480" style="s2">even those of us who favor it don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.850" end="00:04:08.880" style="s2">so naively the fact is free speech</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.480" end="00:04:10.830" style="s2">absolutism results in the protection of</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.880" end="00:04:13.890" style="s2">some things that we would much prefer</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.830" end="00:04:15.900" style="s2">not be protected the reason that we fall</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.890" end="00:04:18.810" style="s2">out is free speech absolutist in any</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.900" end="00:04:21.510" style="s2">event is because there is no way to draw</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.810" end="00:04:24.570" style="s2">the line so that it does not do damage</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.510" end="00:04:24.980" style="s2">and I think I speak for most of those in</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.570" end="00:04:27.770" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.980" end="00:04:31.190" style="s2">camp when I say but we have recognized</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.770" end="00:04:33.370" style="s2">is that the harm done by attempting to</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.190" end="00:04:36.110" style="s2">draw the line tends to be much greater</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.370" end="00:04:37.730" style="s2">than the benefit of drawing the line and</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.110" end="00:04:40.390" style="s2">so in the end we are better off</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.730" end="00:04:43.700" style="s2">accepting that harm than attempting to</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.390" end="00:04:45.920" style="s2">create a border where we will eventually</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.700" end="00:04:47.770" style="s2">do violence if you don&#39;t know what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.920" end="00:04:50.860" style="s2">talking about consider the question of</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.770" end="00:04:53.440" style="s2">dead naming when a person has</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.860" end="00:04:56.390" style="s2">transitioned from one sex to the other</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.440" end="00:04:58.340" style="s2">there is a principle I believe it is</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.390" end="00:05:00.530" style="s2">part of Twitter&#39;s Terms of Service at</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.340" end="00:05:05.240" style="s2">this point that dead naming them is</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.530" end="00:05:07.820" style="s2">considered a violation dead naming is</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.240" end="00:05:09.710" style="s2">simply the act of invoking the name that</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.820" end="00:05:12.320" style="s2">somebody had before they went through</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.710" end="00:05:13.910" style="s2">their transition now in principle I</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.320" end="00:05:16.070" style="s2">would agree that it&#39;s not a very nice</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.910" end="00:05:17.600" style="s2">thing to do and in general when somebody</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.070" end="00:05:19.580" style="s2">says they want to be called by a</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.600" end="00:05:22.070" style="s2">particular name from here on out I see</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.580" end="00:05:24.470" style="s2">no reason that we shouldn&#39;t honor that</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.070" end="00:05:26.720" style="s2">request on the other hand there are</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.470" end="00:05:28.850" style="s2">places where we must not honor that</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.720" end="00:05:32.090" style="s2">request and we are beginning to lose</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.850" end="00:05:34.460" style="s2">sight of this I noticed one particular</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.090" end="00:05:38.810" style="s2">instance recently when Julian Assange</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.460" end="00:05:41.540" style="s2">was arrested that arrest caused a spate</p>

<p begin="00:05:41.540" end="00:05:47.240" style="s2">news reports tended to recount the</p>

<p begin="00:06:28.670" end="00:06:33.050" style="s2">of the Terms of Service of the entity I</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.560" end="00:06:35.300" style="s2">would use to distribute the video well</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.050" end="00:06:37.070" style="s2">that can&#39;t be we have to get back to a</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.300" end="00:06:38.390" style="s2">state where even if I wish to honor</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.070" end="00:06:40.850" style="s2">Chelsea Manning&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.390" end="00:06:43.370" style="s2">to be called Chelsea Manning when we get</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.850" end="00:06:45.710" style="s2">to questions of history I am allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.370" end="00:06:47.840" style="s2">invoke her former identity as Bradley</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.710" end="00:06:51.260" style="s2">Manning as it is an important historical</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.840" end="00:06:53.900" style="s2">fact and an unchangeable one so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.260" end="00:06:55.310" style="s2">move on to the question of steven</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.900" end="00:06:56.960" style="s2">crowder in the interest of full</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.310" end="00:06:59.210" style="s2">disclosure I should tell you that months</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.960" end="00:07:01.550" style="s2">ago Stephen and might invited me on to</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.210" end="00:07:03.500" style="s2">his program and I considered going I</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.550" end="00:07:04.910" style="s2">asked him if we could do it in person</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.500" end="00:07:06.500" style="s2">because I felt like there were some</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.910" end="00:07:08.240" style="s2">difficult things that I had to say to</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.500" end="00:07:10.580" style="s2">him and I didn&#39;t want to do it over a</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.240" end="00:07:13.540" style="s2">remote link he didn&#39;t want to do it in</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.580" end="00:07:16.370" style="s2">person and so I let it go at that</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.540" end="00:07:19.880" style="s2">the fact is I do think those things</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.370" end="00:07:20.930" style="s2">still need to be said what Stephen did</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.880" end="00:07:23.930" style="s2">to Carlos</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.930" end="00:07:26.360" style="s2">Mozza is pretty nasty stuff and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.930" end="00:07:27.740" style="s2">the only time he&#39;s done such a thing a</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.360" end="00:07:31.160" style="s2">year or so ago</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.740" end="00:07:34.610" style="s2">I saw a video in which Steven sent a</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.160" end="00:07:37.460" style="s2">Confederate into a meeting of trans</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.610" end="00:07:40.250" style="s2">people and the Confederate filmed his</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.460" end="00:07:42.740" style="s2">harassment of them presumably for</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.250" end="00:07:45.590" style="s2">comedic purposes but the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.740" end="00:07:47.600" style="s2">struck me as so mean-spirited that I</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.590" end="00:07:50.150" style="s2">couldn&#39;t see any justification for it</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.600" end="00:07:52.670" style="s2">these people were not acting in public</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.150" end="00:07:54.530" style="s2">in some way that required commentary</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.670" end="00:07:56.330" style="s2">these people were simply meeting to</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.530" end="00:07:59.330" style="s2">discuss things and it wasn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.330" end="00:08:01.400" style="s2">Stevens right to disrupt that surely</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.330" end="00:08:03.130" style="s2">people have a right to gather and have</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.400" end="00:08:06.440" style="s2">discussions that are private without</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.130" end="00:08:09.460" style="s2">Steven intervening on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.440" end="00:08:12.380" style="s2">having the tech platforms police</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.460" end="00:08:14.390" style="s2">etiquette is turning into an absolute</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.380" end="00:08:16.940" style="s2">nightmare and there&#39;s no way it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.390" end="00:08:18.980" style="s2">to end well in the end what&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.940" end="00:08:21.320" style="s2">happen is whatever rules they lay down</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.980" end="00:08:23.990" style="s2">are going to be used by bad actors and</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.320" end="00:08:26.150" style="s2">they are going to run roughshod over the</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.990" end="00:08:28.460" style="s2">rest of us so what I&#39;m going to suggest</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.150" end="00:08:30.860" style="s2">is that we do something else</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.460" end="00:08:33.500" style="s2">Steven I&#39;m really talking to you here I</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.860" end="00:08:36.050" style="s2">get a lot out of what you do on YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.500" end="00:08:37.850" style="s2">in particular I&#39;m very fond of the thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.050" end="00:08:40.790" style="s2">you do where you set up a card table on</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.850" end="00:08:42.530" style="s2">a college campus and you have a</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.790" end="00:08:44.600" style="s2">principal stated on the sign and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.530" end="00:08:47.090" style="s2">you ask people to convince you otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.600" end="00:08:49.610" style="s2">I think that&#39;s a very valuable exercise</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.090" end="00:08:51.950" style="s2">it happens I disagree with you a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.610" end="00:08:54.110" style="s2">the time but it is</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.950" end="00:08:56.300" style="s2">very informative to watch people</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.110" end="00:08:58.399" style="s2">challenge you and frankly I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.300" end="00:09:01.730" style="s2">quite humanizing but some of the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.399" end="00:09:04.120" style="s2">you do where you you give people a hard</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.730" end="00:09:06.950" style="s2">time over their sexual orientation or</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.120" end="00:09:09.230" style="s2">other side of stuff I just don&#39;t see any</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.950" end="00:09:12.050" style="s2">reason for it and I think frankly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.230" end="00:09:13.940" style="s2">time for you to outgrow it so in any</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.050" end="00:09:16.220" style="s2">case I&#39;d be willing to talk to you about</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.940" end="00:09:19.610" style="s2">this but I hope you&#39;ll take it to heart</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.220" end="00:09:21.829" style="s2">and think about just simply not be in a</p>
