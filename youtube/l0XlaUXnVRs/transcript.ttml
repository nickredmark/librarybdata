<p begin="00:02:44.319" end="00:02:50.950" style="s2">to do some video editing and then I</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.349" end="00:02:54.609" style="s2">stumbled on site guys addendum around</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.950" end="00:02:57.849" style="s2">two thousand eight or nine so that&#39;s ten</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.609" end="00:03:00.209" style="s2">years ago and when he saw the addendum</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.849" end="00:03:02.349" style="s2">was it like was it like a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.209" end="00:03:04.720" style="s2">cataclysmic shift in your thinking or</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.349" end="00:03:06.909" style="s2">was it like a seed that grew or how did</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.720" end="00:03:11.859" style="s2">it work for you you know it was pretty</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.909" end="00:03:12.790" style="s2">much cataclysmic I just saw you know how</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.859" end="00:03:14.319" style="s2">the world worked</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.790" end="00:03:16.510" style="s2">yeah I kind of knew a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.319" end="00:03:19.419" style="s2">the Baker&#39;s I didn&#39;t really understand</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.510" end="00:03:22.060" style="s2">the fractional reserve lending Ponzi</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.419" end="00:03:24.340" style="s2">scheme that they&#39;re controlling us with</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.060" end="00:03:27.699" style="s2">and once you learn that it&#39;s hard you</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.340" end="00:03:29.199" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to stay still anymore once you</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.699" end="00:03:31.269" style="s2">really know how we&#39;re being controlled</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.199" end="00:03:33.909" style="s2">by the bankers and then you know the</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.269" end="00:03:36.790" style="s2">John Perkins thing with our foreign</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.909" end="00:03:38.739" style="s2">policy that we get and you can see that</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.790" end="00:03:40.030" style="s2">now of those every country really we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.739" end="00:03:45.159" style="s2">just going around stealing their</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.030" end="00:03:46.900" style="s2">resources and and then of course the</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.159" end="00:03:49.090" style="s2">resource-based economy at the end of</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.900" end="00:03:51.489" style="s2">that yeah I was pretty much hooked into</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.090" end="00:03:54.129" style="s2">it and then was moving forward that was</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.489" end="00:03:57.639" style="s2">about the time 2011 I think I started</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.129" end="00:04:01.510" style="s2">making videos and you know Peter Joseph</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.639" end="00:04:04.180" style="s2">described this stuff and you know he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.510" end="00:04:05.979" style="s2">got a great voice and it describes it</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.180" end="00:04:08.829" style="s2">fairly simply but sometimes it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.979" end="00:04:12.909" style="s2">little too more too intellectual maybe</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.829" end="00:04:15.220" style="s2">lecture sounding and so I just thought</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.909" end="00:04:17.880" style="s2">well I wonder if there&#39;s a way I can you</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.220" end="00:04:20.739" style="s2">know get this information across in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.880" end="00:04:23.680" style="s2">friendlier or a more accessible manner</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.739" end="00:04:25.510" style="s2">for Pia and bull bite sizes right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.680" end="00:04:25.760" style="s2">because I mean it tends to be an hour or</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.510" end="00:04:27.920" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.760" end="00:04:33.560" style="s2">and even you know even for me I find it</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.920" end="00:04:35.330" style="s2">a little bit and I&#39;m into it right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.560" end="00:04:37.190" style="s2">so I strongly mention addendum because</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.330" end="00:04:38.960" style="s2">it was the addendum was was the one for</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.190" end="00:04:40.460" style="s2">me as well and something that occurred</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.960" end="00:04:43.240" style="s2">to me as you were talking though if I if</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.460" end="00:04:46.730" style="s2">I if you don&#39;t mind just ask you when</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.240" end="00:04:48.890" style="s2">when you sort of connected the dots with</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.730" end="00:04:50.390" style="s2">the central banking scheme and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.890" end="00:04:52.070" style="s2">tendrils extending through the</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.390" end="00:04:54.320" style="s2">commercial banking system and into the</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.070" end="00:04:56.330" style="s2">mortgage market and wreaths you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.320" end="00:04:58.280" style="s2">lending money back to gut lending grab</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.330" end="00:04:59.990" style="s2">government&#39;s own currencies back to them</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.280" end="00:05:03.280" style="s2">at interest and all and all of this kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.990" end="00:05:07.940" style="s2">of thing and did you see straight away</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.280" end="00:05:10.310" style="s2">this being a intentional mechanism by</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.940" end="00:05:12.020" style="s2">which the labor and creativity was being</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.310" end="00:05:18.500" style="s2">sucked out for the vast majority of</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.020" end="00:05:20.810" style="s2">people or was it like no one really knew</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.500" end="00:05:22.640" style="s2">because I mean I it seems to me that the</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.810" end="00:05:23.840" style="s2">internet and I think I&#39;ve seen you make</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.640" end="00:05:26.240" style="s2">this point in one of your videos that</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.840" end="00:05:30.260" style="s2">until twenty years or so ago nobody knew</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.240" end="00:05:32.090" style="s2">about this right there&#39;s a it&#39;s still a</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.260" end="00:05:36.380" style="s2">fairly small percentage but there are a</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.090" end="00:05:39.380" style="s2">growing number of people actually get it</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.380" end="00:05:40.940" style="s2">as a mechanism of slavery as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.380" end="00:05:42.230" style="s2">oh yeah well bankers create money out of</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.940" end="00:05:43.670" style="s2">man cuz I get lots of people that</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.230" end="00:05:44.800" style="s2">understand you base create money out of</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.670" end="00:05:47.240" style="s2">nothing but I don&#39;t get that they</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.800" end="00:05:50.330" style="s2">understand the implications of that and</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.240" end="00:05:51.680" style="s2">the unpayable that just builds up and up</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.330" end="00:05:53.720" style="s2">and up and up and up you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.680" end="00:05:55.400" style="s2">mean I think in two thousand one hundred</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.720" end="00:05:57.430" style="s2">and sixty trillion dollars of debt and</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.400" end="00:06:00.950" style="s2">sixty trillion dollars of money you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.430" end="00:06:03.740" style="s2">in dollars of unpaid up out there you</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.950" end="00:06:05.960" style="s2">know what I mean you&#39;ll understand the</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.740" end="00:06:06.590" style="s2">ramifications of this what&#39;s your take</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.960" end="00:06:09.650" style="s2">on that</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.590" end="00:06:12.200" style="s2">yeah I understood it fairly quickly once</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.650" end="00:06:15.260" style="s2">I saw it laid out there of how really</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.200" end="00:06:18.020" style="s2">it&#39;s just a system to control people to</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.260" end="00:06:20.360" style="s2">put people into debt that they can you</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.020" end="00:06:22.250" style="s2">know never pay off her you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.360" end="00:06:25.160" style="s2">sometimes you may be lucky enough to pay</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.250" end="00:06:27.470" style="s2">it off but mostly it&#39;s just continually</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.160" end="00:06:30.440" style="s2">creating more debt and you have to</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.470" end="00:06:33.680" style="s2">borrow more to to stay in the game and</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.440" end="00:06:35.540" style="s2">they are just sucking the money out of</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.680" end="00:06:38.930" style="s2">people and controlling us like slaves</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.540" end="00:06:43.220" style="s2">and it didn&#39;t take long to see that</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.930" end="00:06:48.770" style="s2">so yeah that&#39;s how do you find that</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.220" end="00:06:50.810" style="s2">people are refres the people that have</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.770" end="00:06:53.210" style="s2">sort of it&#39;s been exposed to the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.810" end="00:06:58.520" style="s2">the central banking fraud do you think</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.210" end="00:07:00.470" style="s2">that they appreciate the the the depth</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.520" end="00:07:03.259" style="s2">and the complexity of it for the most</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.470" end="00:07:04.970" style="s2">part I mean either broadly speaking it</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.259" end="00:07:07.490" style="s2">did you if I try to explain it to people</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.970" end="00:07:09.530" style="s2">you know a lot of times their eyes kind</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.490" end="00:07:11.990" style="s2">of glaze over after me they don&#39;t they</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.530" end="00:07:15.080" style="s2">don&#39;t really want to look into it or</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.990" end="00:07:17.150" style="s2">think about it too hard so some people</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.080" end="00:07:19.789" style="s2">will kind of understand it a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.150" end="00:07:20.330" style="s2">people is just well this is just the way</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.789" end="00:07:22.039" style="s2">it is</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.330" end="00:07:24.919" style="s2">yeah okay you can&#39;t really do anything</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.039" end="00:07:26.389" style="s2">about it the reality of this love their</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.919" end="00:07:31.729" style="s2">slavery in the face right I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.389" end="00:07:33.979" style="s2">a hard place yeah yeah you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.729" end="00:07:35.930" style="s2">been a main motivator for me especially</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.979" end="00:07:39.650" style="s2">then you know I built a house here and</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.930" end="00:07:42.050" style="s2">I&#39;ve had to borrow against it and again</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.650" end="00:07:45.889" style="s2">a few times just to keep my head above</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.050" end="00:07:47.960" style="s2">and just think of how these bankers are</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.889" end="00:07:50.630" style="s2">just making up the money I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.960" end="00:07:53.000" style="s2">where you want us to pay him back with</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.630" end="00:07:53.930" style="s2">interest which is never created she</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.000" end="00:07:56.720" style="s2">doesn&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.930" end="00:07:58.729" style="s2">and if you can&#39;t do it they get your</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.720" end="00:08:00.320" style="s2">house they get your car whatever they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.729" end="00:08:01.760" style="s2">loaning your life the game physical</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.320" end="00:08:03.169" style="s2">chairs with fewer and fewer chairs in</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.760" end="00:08:06.560" style="s2">the game constantly if you don&#39;t a few</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.169" end="00:08:08.360" style="s2">chairs yeah yeah absolutely and then you</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.560" end="00:08:11.060" style="s2">know I Rebecca in sort of studied at the</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.360" end="00:08:16.699" style="s2">beginning of this country here when the</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.060" end="00:08:21.680" style="s2">founders were trying to escape from the</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.699" end="00:08:23.720" style="s2">control of Britain and and you know we</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.680" end="00:08:24.919" style="s2">were told well you know the revolution</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.720" end="00:08:26.690" style="s2">it was really just about their</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.919" end="00:08:29.900" style="s2">government you know that mean government</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.690" end="00:08:32.479" style="s2">over there charging its taxes and well</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.900" end="00:08:36.829" style="s2">actually it was the bankers who owned</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.479" end="00:08:39.800" style="s2">the government who were willing to you</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.829" end="00:08:42.589" style="s2">know to get us into their fractional</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.800" end="00:08:45.770" style="s2">reserve system and that was the real</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.589" end="00:08:48.320" style="s2">thing you know Benjamin Franklin when he</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.770" end="00:08:50.390" style="s2">was back he was in France a couple</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.320" end="00:08:52.760" style="s2">decades before the Revolution and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.390" end="00:08:55.010" style="s2">colonies were doing great</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.760" end="00:08:58.790" style="s2">and people were asking about this</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.010" end="00:09:01.430" style="s2">newfound prosperity in the colonies how</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.790" end="00:09:04.850" style="s2">are you doing it and he said in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.430" end="00:09:07.430" style="s2">colonies we create our own currency we</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.850" end="00:09:11.620" style="s2">make our own money and we made just</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.430" end="00:09:11.620" style="s2">enough to society</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.760" end="00:09:18.780" style="s2">have no interest to pay to anyone</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.910" end="00:09:21.030" style="s2">and certainly after that the King George</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.780" end="00:09:23.280" style="s2">and the bankers who really owned him</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.030" end="00:09:25.200" style="s2">they said no we&#39;ll have none of that</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.280" end="00:09:28.410" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna be on our money system</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.200" end="00:09:32.850" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna pay US taxes in gold and</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.410" end="00:09:36.000" style="s2">silver and he said within a year the</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.850" end="00:09:38.310" style="s2">conditions had reversed so dramatically</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.000" end="00:09:40.650" style="s2">from the prosperity that now there were</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.310" end="00:09:42.390" style="s2">unemployed in the streets and you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.650" end="00:09:45.210" style="s2">once you get in the system where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.390" end="00:09:48.150" style="s2">sucking the wealth out of it you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.210" end="00:09:51.300" style="s2">and he said the refusal of King George</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.150" end="00:09:54.660" style="s2">to allow the colonies to operate an</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.300" end="00:09:56.930" style="s2">honest money system which freed the</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.660" end="00:10:00.390" style="s2">ordinary man from the clutches of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.930" end="00:10:03.810" style="s2">manipulators the king was probably the</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.390" end="00:10:05.280" style="s2">prime cause of the revolution so we</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.810" end="00:10:07.980" style="s2">never learned that in school that it was</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.280" end="00:10:10.320" style="s2">the bankers and their fractional reserve</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.980" end="00:10:12.720" style="s2">lending system that was probably the</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.320" end="00:10:14.400" style="s2">real reason you know we do a it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.720" end="00:10:16.530" style="s2">missed names right because there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.400" end="00:10:17.880" style="s2">taxation without representation or that</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.530" end="00:10:19.920" style="s2">was there that was the that was the</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.880" end="00:10:22.320" style="s2">slogan right but what on earth acts</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.920" end="00:10:24.240" style="s2">ation other than interest payments on</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.320" end="00:10:26.040" style="s2">central bank loans to the government I</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.240" end="00:10:27.570" style="s2">mean that&#39;s that&#39;s basically what so</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.040" end="00:10:29.880" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of the same thing it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.570" end="00:10:32.210" style="s2">not called that and that&#39;s what our</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.880" end="00:10:35.010" style="s2">taxis are going for now you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.210" end="00:10:36.690" style="s2">you know we we got rid of the bankers</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.010" end="00:10:39.390" style="s2">for a while they came back over the past</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.690" end="00:10:41.130" style="s2">couple hundred years and then in 1913</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.390" end="00:10:43.770" style="s2">they got in there with the Federal</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.130" end="00:10:45.570" style="s2">Reserve&#39;s impact and they passed it on</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.770" end="00:10:51.060" style="s2">Christmas Eve right we thought soon all</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.570" end="00:11:01.230" style="s2">sentences in the house and since then</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.060" end="00:11:02.670" style="s2">and then they set up the IRS you know it</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.230" end="00:11:05.520" style="s2">was set up right after they installed</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.670" end="00:11:08.130" style="s2">the coal reserve that&#39;s basically their</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.520" end="00:11:11.160" style="s2">collection agency to collect their</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.130" end="00:11:13.830" style="s2">interest and so you know just to see all</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.160" end="00:11:16.910" style="s2">this interest made the taxes that were</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.830" end="00:11:20.310" style="s2">paying now most of it is going to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.910" end="00:11:22.650" style="s2">central bankers and the rest I think for</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.310" end="00:11:24.620" style="s2">bonds and military that&#39;s where our</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.650" end="00:11:27.530" style="s2">taxes go so</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.620" end="00:11:30.080" style="s2">it&#39;s such a horrible system we&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.530" end="00:11:32.660" style="s2">break free of it and that&#39;s the only way</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.080" end="00:11:35.030" style="s2">I think we can truly break free is to do</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.660" end="00:11:37.940" style="s2">what the founders wanted to do was get</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.030" end="00:11:41.750" style="s2">rid of the central bankers and have our</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.940" end="00:11:43.790" style="s2">own money system which was as fair as</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.750" end="00:11:45.530" style="s2">you can possibly know yes that money is</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.790" end="00:11:46.550" style="s2">created in order to serve a purpose and</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.530" end="00:11:48.080" style="s2">they must the purpose of serving the</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.550" end="00:11:49.370" style="s2">money is pay back it is destroyed and</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.080" end="00:11:51.680" style="s2">it&#39;s removed from circulation and it</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.370" end="00:11:52.940" style="s2">stays in balance as a consequence of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.680" end="00:11:54.620" style="s2">amount of money&#39;s in circulation the</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.940" end="00:11:57.920" style="s2">amount of money owed are always equal to</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.620" end="00:11:59.750" style="s2">each other right right it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.920" end="00:12:02.060" style="s2">how few people understand the notion</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.750" end="00:12:04.130" style="s2">that when a loan is paid back the money</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.060" end="00:12:05.390" style="s2">that pays back that loan is destroyed I</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.130" end="00:12:06.860" style="s2">find it interesting how few people</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.390" end="00:12:08.180" style="s2">understand that notion give that the</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.860" end="00:12:08.810" style="s2">money was created out for loan in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.180" end="00:12:10.730" style="s2">first place</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.810" end="00:12:12.650" style="s2">it must annihilate when it comes back</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.730" end="00:12:14.930" style="s2">into contact right I matter/antimatter</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.650" end="00:12:16.700" style="s2">thing but again I find it interesting</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.930" end="00:12:19.580" style="s2">how few people appreciate that notion</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.700" end="00:12:21.590" style="s2">out there there&#39;s a terrible lack of</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.580" end="00:12:24.740" style="s2">education about the realities of</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.590" end="00:12:27.860" style="s2">economics in our society deliberately so</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.740" end="00:12:33.860" style="s2">they&#39;re obvious reasons right but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.860" end="00:12:35.600" style="s2">real shocking lack yeah so if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.860" end="00:12:37.910" style="s2">mind sorry I just about to say something</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.600" end="00:12:40.310" style="s2">though I didn&#39;t want to interrupt you</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.910" end="00:12:46.790" style="s2">I was just probably gonna call out about</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.310" end="00:12:49.040" style="s2">the bankers you have been and are going</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.790" end="00:12:55.520" style="s2">to be in next year a presidential</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.040" end="00:12:58.640" style="s2">candidate I mean I so political process</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.520" end="00:13:01.850" style="s2">and about what it&#39;s like being a being a</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.640" end="00:13:03.410" style="s2">candidate yeah yeah I mean let&#39;s let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.850" end="00:13:05.240" style="s2">start with the first thing I mean I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.410" end="00:13:07.550" style="s2">just curious about a few things if you</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.240" end="00:13:09.460" style="s2">don&#39;t mind in terms of how it works over</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.550" end="00:13:12.140" style="s2">there I&#39;m obviously English and so</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.460" end="00:13:14.480" style="s2">during your candidacy do do you have a</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.140" end="00:13:16.340" style="s2">right to be on the debates with you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.480" end="00:13:19.430" style="s2">the Republican and Democrat and whatever</p>

<p begin="00:13:19.430" end="00:13:31.880" style="s2">oh this stuff is really sad in this</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.470" end="00:13:33.800" style="s2">country I think we&#39;re probably more</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.880" end="00:13:36.260" style="s2">controlled than any other country when</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.800" end="00:13:38.410" style="s2">it comes to elections because they have</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.260" end="00:13:40.840" style="s2">got the two-party system</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.410" end="00:13:43.800" style="s2">and so they&#39;ve got the you know the big</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.840" end="00:13:46.660" style="s2">democratic debates coming up they&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.800" end="00:13:48.190" style="s2">24 people running but they&#39;re cutting</p>

<p begin="00:13:48.190" end="00:13:54.070" style="s2">nights of ten each and that&#39;s coming up</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.520" end="00:13:56.320" style="s2">soon to start yet we&#39;re a year and a</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.070" end="00:13:58.090" style="s2">half away from the election which is</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.320" end="00:14:01.000" style="s2">another thing that&#39;s crazy it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.090" end="00:14:03.280" style="s2">distraction the electoral cycle yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.000" end="00:14:05.320" style="s2">yeah yeah it should be you know three or</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.280" end="00:14:07.870" style="s2">four months we should just start it and</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.320" end="00:14:10.840" style="s2">then finish it but no it&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.870" end="00:14:14.260" style="s2">distraction for them and so yeah we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.840" end="00:14:16.060" style="s2">got and then there&#39;s Green Party for the</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.260" end="00:14:18.990" style="s2">third a third party and there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.060" end="00:14:22.120" style="s2">libertarians for a fourth party and</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.990" end="00:14:24.660" style="s2">they&#39;ve been very serious about getting</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.120" end="00:14:27.480" style="s2">their party registered in all 50 states</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.660" end="00:14:30.070" style="s2">right every every state has different</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.480" end="00:14:32.260" style="s2">requirements for that so you may need to</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.070" end="00:14:35.680" style="s2">go out and get seven thousand signatures</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.260" end="00:14:39.100" style="s2">on the petition and then submit that to</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.680" end="00:14:43.390" style="s2">the state and then have meetings and a</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.100" end="00:14:45.700" style="s2">charter and so it&#39;s a lot of Hoops that</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.390" end="00:14:48.250" style="s2">you have to drunk jump through just to</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.700" end="00:14:51.040" style="s2">be able to get your party registered and</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.250" end="00:14:52.840" style="s2">get a candidate on the ballot some</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.040" end="00:14:55.480" style="s2">states have different requirements for a</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.840" end="00:14:58.420" style="s2">minor party where you don&#39;t need quite</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.480" end="00:15:01.510" style="s2">as much and then there&#39;s always you</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.420" end="00:15:04.180" style="s2">could run as an independent which which</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.510" end="00:15:06.100" style="s2">I will probably end up doing because you</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.180" end="00:15:08.200" style="s2">know if we had thousands of people in</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.100" end="00:15:10.930" style="s2">this country backing well we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.200" end="00:15:14.290" style="s2">to do with the money free from party we</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.930" end="00:15:16.630" style="s2">could we could get on the on the ballots</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.290" end="00:15:19.150" style="s2">as money through party is a minor party</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.630" end="00:15:21.070" style="s2">but you know there&#39;s not a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.150" end="00:15:23.050" style="s2">jumping in line to get out and work at</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.070" end="00:15:25.510" style="s2">this because it really does seem so</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.050" end="00:15:27.550" style="s2">hopeless they ask you because you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.510" end="00:15:30.010" style="s2">looked at the last elections where the</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.550" end="00:15:33.010" style="s2">Democrats and the Republicans get about</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.010" end="00:15:35.470" style="s2">95 percent of the votes and the other 5%</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.010" end="00:15:38.730" style="s2">is split up between the Green for</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.470" end="00:15:42.730" style="s2">negative to purse and libertarians 2%</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.730" end="00:15:45.070" style="s2">compared to 45 to 50% for the Republic</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.730" end="00:15:47.860" style="s2">and everybody feels like they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.070" end="00:15:50.800" style="s2">throwing their vote away if they vote</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.860" end="00:15:51.520" style="s2">for a third party and this year it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.800" end="00:15:53.170" style="s2">going to be worse than</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.520" end="00:15:56.200" style="s2">never because you know everybody just</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.170" end="00:15:58.900" style="s2">wants to get Trump out of there except</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.200" end="00:16:00.700" style="s2">for his supporters so there&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.900" end="00:16:03.850" style="s2">be thirty thirty five percent of his</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.700" end="00:16:05.080" style="s2">supporters and then everybody else is</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.850" end="00:16:08.260" style="s2">just going to be going through the</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.080" end="00:16:11.350" style="s2">Democrat even if it&#39;s another corporate</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.260" end="00:16:13.600" style="s2">Democrat like Biden if we had Bernie in</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.350" end="00:16:16.210" style="s2">there tulsi gabbard who&#39;s against the</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.600" end="00:16:18.760" style="s2">wars if we had those those people in</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.210" end="00:16:20.350" style="s2">there I&#39;d be a little more excited but I</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.760" end="00:16:24.460" style="s2">don&#39;t think the Democratic establishment</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.350" end="00:16:25.840" style="s2">will even let that happen so as he said</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.460" end="00:16:27.550" style="s2">in one of your videos I mean I&#39;ve heard</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.840" end="00:16:29.650" style="s2">you say exactly this that you know even</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.550" end="00:16:33.100" style="s2">if you get genuinely well-intentioned</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.650" end="00:16:35.590" style="s2">people elected they are still stuck with</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.100" end="00:16:37.450" style="s2">this apparatus with the inertia built</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.590" end="00:16:40.390" style="s2">into the apparatus is overwhelming you</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.450" end="00:16:42.670" style="s2">know and however so it is the apparatus</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.390" end="00:16:45.580" style="s2">that needs to change and I mean this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.670" end="00:16:46.600" style="s2">this is one of the leading naturally -</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.580" end="00:16:48.790" style="s2">it&#39;s one of the angles I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.600" end="00:16:52.230" style="s2">explore with you was the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.790" end="00:16:55.180" style="s2">is there any kind of possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.230" end="00:16:57.610" style="s2">institutional driven change ie top-down</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.180" end="00:16:59.860" style="s2">change driving us towards RBA or some</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.610" end="00:17:02.020" style="s2">kind of more sustainable system is is</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.860" end="00:17:03.580" style="s2">that even possible I mean I understand</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.020" end="00:17:05.440" style="s2">that your campaign is primarily a</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.580" end="00:17:06.760" style="s2">platform from which to speak you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.440" end="00:17:08.920" style="s2">actually hoping to implement any</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.760" end="00:17:10.839" style="s2">policies right is it&#39;s a publicist it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.920" end="00:17:13.270" style="s2">a way of gaining more notoriety in</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.839" end="00:17:15.820" style="s2">publicity primarily right yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.270" end="00:17:19.120" style="s2">educational than just to get to present</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.820" end="00:17:20.440" style="s2">this new economic system or presidential</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.120" end="00:17:21.940" style="s2">candidate lends you a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.440" end="00:17:23.200" style="s2">credibility right I mean people are also</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.940" end="00:17:24.430" style="s2">actually gonna listen to you a little</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.200" end="00:17:26.680" style="s2">bit more because you&#39;re a presidential</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.430" end="00:17:30.070" style="s2">candidate that&#39;s right and I get that</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.680" end="00:17:32.200" style="s2">from Richmond Ausmus to a few a few four</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.070" end="00:17:34.540" style="s2">years ago whenever he started running I</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.200" end="00:17:36.880" style="s2">found out about that that I you know got</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.540" end="00:17:39.280" style="s2">to know him and saw that he was getting</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.880" end="00:17:41.740" style="s2">out there and talking to people and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.280" end="00:17:43.870" style="s2">what a great way to get this message</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.740" end="00:17:46.060" style="s2">across to people and everybody in these</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.870" end="00:17:48.010" style="s2">know many movements don&#39;t want to have</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.060" end="00:17:51.100" style="s2">anything to do with politics you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.010" end="00:17:53.860" style="s2">they say no we can&#39;t do we gotta move</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.100" end="00:17:56.290" style="s2">beyond politics but while we&#39;re stuck in</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.860" end="00:17:59.440" style="s2">this system you might say everything is</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.290" end="00:18:01.240" style="s2">politics really at this point so you</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.440" end="00:18:04.090" style="s2">know here was a chance to really just</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.240" end="00:18:05.200" style="s2">get heard by more people and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.090" end="00:18:08.350" style="s2">why I started</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.200" end="00:18:10.149" style="s2">20:16 i made the videos but it was not</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.350" end="00:18:12.549" style="s2">really serious at all it was just trying</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.149" end="00:18:14.559" style="s2">to lay out the train of thought though</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.549" end="00:18:15.669" style="s2">they were very good I mean I almost all</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.559" end="00:18:16.779" style="s2">of them I watched four or five of them</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.669" end="00:18:18.100" style="s2">but they&#39;re there they&#39;re very very good</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.779" end="00:18:19.990" style="s2">particularly the second one where you</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.100" end="00:18:24.880" style="s2">really outline the problems what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.990" end="00:18:27.549" style="s2">slogan that you use bad for people that</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.880" end="00:18:30.789" style="s2">that whole whole angle was excellent I</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.549" end="00:18:33.279" style="s2">thought yes god it works against us</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.789" end="00:18:35.669" style="s2">that&#39;s right the system works against us</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.279" end="00:18:38.559" style="s2">you know if we want to sell more</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.669" end="00:18:40.950" style="s2">pesticides or you know that&#39;s good for</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.559" end="00:18:44.320" style="s2">business it&#39;s horrible for people and</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.950" end="00:18:46.750" style="s2">more pharmaceuticals more pills to take</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.320" end="00:18:48.190" style="s2">that&#39;s horrible for people really as</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.750" end="00:18:50.019" style="s2">it&#39;s turning out but it&#39;s good for</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.190" end="00:18:51.940" style="s2">business so I&#39;m going to go through ten</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.019" end="00:18:53.440" style="s2">examples of that and there are many many</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.940" end="00:18:55.659" style="s2">more you could think of without trying</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.440" end="00:18:58.269" style="s2">too hard right now it&#39;s a really good</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.659" end="00:18:59.590" style="s2">angle because it is you can&#39;t argue with</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.269" end="00:19:03.279" style="s2">it you know what I mean it&#39;s undeniable</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.590" end="00:19:05.130" style="s2">you really critical persuasion you</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.279" end="00:19:07.840" style="s2">really can&#39;t argue with this stuff um</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.130" end="00:19:09.279" style="s2">another thing which I cast I think you</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.840" end="00:19:10.990" style="s2">said something along these lines but it</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.279" end="00:19:12.669" style="s2">also links to something else I&#39;ve become</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.990" end="00:19:15.279" style="s2">very interested in recently the idea</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.669" end="00:19:17.529" style="s2">that we are manipulated by these</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.279" end="00:19:20.740" style="s2">structures to act against our own</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.529" end="00:19:22.510" style="s2">self-interest right yeah and this is you</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.740" end="00:19:24.279" style="s2">know this is obviously profoundly</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.510" end="00:19:26.580" style="s2">destructive in the long term and and</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.279" end="00:19:31.380" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a guy called Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.580" end="00:19:31.380" style="s2">Schmitt and Berger I think his name is</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.889" end="00:19:38.500" style="s2">I&#39;ve heard of him familiar he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.919" end="00:19:39.340" style="s2">interested in sort of deconstructing the</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.500" end="00:19:41.529" style="s2">gayi</p>

<p begin="00:19:46.059" end="00:19:50.980" style="s2">a and that game a is what we currently</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.649" end="00:19:52.809" style="s2">play right game a is the swill the</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.980" end="00:19:54.789" style="s2">attempted solution to how can large</p>

<p begin="00:20:05.740" end="00:20:11.440" style="s2">playing game a right but the game a can</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.440" end="00:20:13.389" style="s2">no longer cope with the complexity the</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.440" end="00:20:15.460" style="s2">variation in demands of society no it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.389" end="00:20:16.929" style="s2">just become too much for game a the</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.460" end="00:20:19.299" style="s2">institutions are no longer able to cope</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.929" end="00:20:21.159" style="s2">and so we must playing game be</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.299" end="00:20:22.480" style="s2">our own survival we need to start</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.159" end="00:20:26.980" style="s2">playing game B and the question then</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.480" end="00:20:29.169" style="s2">becomes what is game B right and so many</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.980" end="00:20:31.210" style="s2">of the things that they talk about that</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.169" end="00:20:33.909" style="s2">are features that are aspects of game B</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.210" end="00:20:35.499" style="s2">are directly relevant to our B I mean</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.909" end="00:20:38.470" style="s2">they they they make absence like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.499" end="00:20:41.139" style="s2">talking about our B am it is like that</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.470" end="00:20:43.210" style="s2">so they talk non-rival risk</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.139" end="00:20:46.600" style="s2">collaboration so groups of people coming</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.210" end="00:20:48.210" style="s2">together simply to in a spirit of</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.600" end="00:20:50.889" style="s2">openness and honesty and vulnerability</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.210" end="00:20:52.600" style="s2">right willing to be wrong really willing</p>

<p begin="00:21:04.259" end="00:21:09.190" style="s2">emergent thing which is way more than</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.149" end="00:21:10.269" style="s2">the sum of its parts and even more than</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.190" end="00:21:11.830" style="s2">the sum of the parts and the</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.269" end="00:21:13.389" style="s2">relationship between the parts you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.830" end="00:21:15.940" style="s2">what I mean is this is this other thing</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.389" end="00:21:18.340" style="s2">but this can only be done in a spirit of</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.940" end="00:21:20.169" style="s2">non-rival nerds brought that non-rival</p>

<p begin="00:21:32.499" end="00:21:36.100" style="s2">stuff and that we as a society at the</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.359" end="00:21:38.409" style="s2">moment are completely incapable of doing</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.100" end="00:21:40.359" style="s2">that but we must learn because that and</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.409" end="00:21:42.909" style="s2">and and that&#39;s all RPE right I mean</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.359" end="00:21:45.279" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s right at the heart of what</p>

<p begin="00:21:45.279" end="00:21:52.139" style="s2">moving to a collaborative society where</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.519" end="00:21:55.539" style="s2">we can work together and we can produce</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.139" end="00:21:58.869" style="s2">abundance and such a wonderful trusting</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.539" end="00:22:01.149" style="s2">society if we move the collaboration but</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.869" end="00:22:03.639" style="s2">when we are forced to stick in this</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.149" end="00:22:06.129" style="s2">system work we&#39;re forced to fight each</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.639" end="00:22:10.029" style="s2">other that&#39;s what this is you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.129" end="00:22:12.700" style="s2">cutthroat competition sorry we are</p>

<p begin="00:22:12.700" end="00:22:19.029" style="s2">advantage over each other and it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.629" end="00:22:20.919" style="s2">allow us to have any trust you when it</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.029" end="00:22:23.109" style="s2">comes to business you can&#39;t trust</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.919" end="00:22:25.739" style="s2">anybody everybody is trying to get the</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.109" end="00:22:28.869" style="s2">best of the deal and it&#39;s it&#39;s really a</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.739" end="00:22:31.389" style="s2">system that goes against our true nature</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.869" end="00:22:33.120" style="s2">you know it&#39;s a system that produces</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.389" end="00:22:35.670" style="s2">selfishness and greed</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.120" end="00:22:40.230" style="s2">and that&#39;s why people say well this is</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.670" end="00:22:43.940" style="s2">human nature just look at us but no this</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.230" end="00:22:47.309" style="s2">is human behavior that&#39;s one point</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.940" end="00:22:50.670" style="s2">absolutely behavior then results from</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.309" end="00:22:52.740" style="s2">the system in which we&#39;re living and you</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.670" end="00:22:55.620" style="s2">know studies on the brain and they can</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.740" end="00:22:59.010" style="s2">tell when we are able to collaborate</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.620" end="00:23:02.430" style="s2">when we can express our empathy and our</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.010" end="00:23:04.710" style="s2">compassion and you know to want to feel</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.430" end="00:23:07.500" style="s2">part of the community and be loved this</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.710" end="00:23:11.010" style="s2">is really our true human nature this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.500" end="00:23:13.290" style="s2">what makes people healthy and so you</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.010" end="00:23:16.320" style="s2">know this is simply what we have to do</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.290" end="00:23:18.929" style="s2">is move out of this competitive system</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.320" end="00:23:20.460" style="s2">move into a collaborative system where</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.929" end="00:23:22.920" style="s2">we&#39;re allowed to work together and</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.460" end="00:23:27.750" style="s2">create an abundance and this is the only</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.920" end="00:23:32.160" style="s2">way out of this this dilemma that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.750" end="00:23:41.510" style="s2">stuck in this suicidal ecocidal system</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.160" end="00:23:44.850" style="s2">that it&#39;s just killing us you know but</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.510" end="00:23:46.710" style="s2">we&#39;ve been running what what these guys</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.850" end="00:23:49.500" style="s2">would refer to as game a code but this</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.710" end="00:23:51.150" style="s2">rival risks chipping off each other you</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.500" end="00:23:52.230" style="s2">know in order for me to win you have to</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.150" end="00:23:54.330" style="s2">lose</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.230" end="00:23:57.210" style="s2">you know fear of scarcity in the future</p>

<p begin="00:23:57.210" end="00:24:02.550" style="s2">know way way beyond what is actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.910" end="00:24:04.950" style="s2">reasonable do you think it&#39;s reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.550" end="00:24:06.540" style="s2">to expect people to uninstall game a</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.950" end="00:24:08.970" style="s2">code order you know whatever you want to</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.540" end="00:24:11.010" style="s2">call it and you know it&#39;s it&#39;s a hell of</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.970" end="00:24:12.090" style="s2">a leap well it is when you&#39;re that side</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.010" end="00:24:13.350" style="s2">of it it&#39;s funny I was talking to</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.090" end="00:24:14.490" style="s2">Richard about this when you get to the</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.350" end="00:24:16.140" style="s2">other side of it and you look I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.490" end="00:24:17.220" style="s2">all that was really easy that&#39;s change</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.140" end="00:24:19.080" style="s2">perspective but when you&#39;re on the other</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.220" end="00:24:24.240" style="s2">side of it it&#39;s you know should be not</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.080" end="00:24:26.910" style="s2">you know what I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.240" end="00:24:30.510" style="s2">actually think it&#39;s going to be easy for</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.910" end="00:24:33.360" style="s2">people to transition into this society</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.510" end="00:24:35.910" style="s2">when they see the benefit if they could</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.360" end="00:24:39.360" style="s2">only have it laid out in front of them</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.910" end="00:24:41.460" style="s2">and explained look we can actually be</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.360" end="00:24:43.220" style="s2">working together and produce an</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.460" end="00:24:45.240" style="s2">abundance of the things we need</p>

<p begin="00:24:45.240" end="00:24:50.940" style="s2">as much as production as we need we can</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.850" end="00:24:53.670" style="s2">go to a 20 hour work week that&#39;s all we</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.940" end="00:24:56.370" style="s2">would have to do you know we know it</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.670" end="00:24:59.520" style="s2">would get rid of war and it would get</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.370" end="00:25:02.730" style="s2">rid of taxes and you know so many things</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.520" end="00:25:05.490" style="s2">that everybody right now is it&#39;s killing</p>

<p begin="00:25:05.490" end="00:25:09.180" style="s2">Washington to thinking well this is the</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.140" end="00:25:12.390" style="s2">only way it is but if they could just</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.180" end="00:25:14.850" style="s2">have a look at how it could be and just</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.390" end="00:25:16.560" style="s2">understand that and see it I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.850" end="00:25:20.550" style="s2">would be good to be able to see this</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.560" end="00:25:23.130" style="s2">somehow you know rather than some just</p>

<p begin="00:26:13.140" end="00:26:19.800" style="s2">rather than going right to the point of</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.520" end="00:26:24.180" style="s2">money free or no money moving through a</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.800" end="00:26:27.140" style="s2">moneyless society or scarcity you know I</p>

<p begin="00:26:27.140" end="00:26:33.120" style="s2">that&#39;ll be a step once we can produce an</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.420" end="00:26:35.310" style="s2">abundance of the things we need we can</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.120" end="00:26:38.400" style="s2">make it three but we&#39;re gonna have to do</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.310" end="00:26:40.920" style="s2">that maybe step by step over that when</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.400" end="00:26:44.400" style="s2">I&#39;m talking about money free party I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.920" end="00:26:49.470" style="s2">meaning free freedom from the bankers</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.400" end="00:26:51.750" style="s2">free freeing ourselves from the bankers</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.470" end="00:26:53.160" style="s2">in the corporate state that&#39;s where we</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.750" end="00:26:55.460" style="s2">need to get had need a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.160" end="00:26:58.210" style="s2">have been talking about this modern</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.460" end="00:27:02.800" style="s2">monetary theory and</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.210" end="00:27:07.360" style="s2">he have you heard about em yeah well you</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.800" end="00:27:10.600" style="s2">know it&#39;s just the truth about how our</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.360" end="00:27:12.670" style="s2">money is is this positive money those</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.600" end="00:27:18.750" style="s2">kinds of guys is it that is it that kind</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.670" end="00:27:21.910" style="s2">of free currency basically as is yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.750" end="00:27:24.340" style="s2">you know I&#39;m not sure about so much of</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.910" end="00:27:28.210" style="s2">exactly how it works that they&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.340" end="00:27:31.900" style="s2">going to be some debt but you know the</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.210" end="00:27:34.120" style="s2">money that is that&#39;s made up for a</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.900" end="00:27:40.210" style="s2">military budget when suddenly we want</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.120" end="00:27:42.910" style="s2">400 billion more dollars we need money</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.210" end="00:27:45.640" style="s2">to bail out the two or three trillion</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.910" end="00:27:50.470" style="s2">dollars to be bail out the bankers after</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.640" end="00:27:52.780" style="s2">2008 it&#39;s not like they taxed us and we</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.470" end="00:27:53.170" style="s2">had to pay taxes to come up with that</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.780" end="00:27:56.260" style="s2">money</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.170" end="00:27:58.750" style="s2">they just created you they just created</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.260" end="00:28:00.880" style="s2">out of thin air and here&#39;s two trillion</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.750" end="00:28:02.410" style="s2">dollars for the bankers goes on their</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.880" end="00:28:04.510" style="s2">own are dead but you know nobody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.410" end="00:28:06.280" style="s2">taking the dentist no let&#39;s do that to</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.510" end="00:28:09.160" style="s2">properly finance schools or healthcare</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.280" end="00:28:12.520" style="s2">or road building or you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.160" end="00:28:14.620" style="s2">II projects or energy transfer projects</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.520" end="00:28:16.470" style="s2">or whatever when they get around to</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.620" end="00:28:22.210" style="s2">anything that&#39;s gonna help your</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.470" end="00:28:23.800" style="s2">education or then they go we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.210" end="00:28:27.220" style="s2">have to raise taxes we&#39;re gonna have to</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.800" end="00:28:30.490" style="s2">take it out of the budget in reality we</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.220" end="00:28:32.740" style="s2">can just make that money up too and so</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.490" end="00:28:34.240" style="s2">that&#39;s the basic theory but ya know I</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.740" end="00:28:38.110" style="s2">have read something about that I have</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.240" end="00:28:40.030" style="s2">read something and it doesn&#39;t it can be</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.110" end="00:28:41.770" style="s2">interest-free and so they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.030" end="00:28:43.600" style="s2">way of destroying money right they take</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.770" end="00:28:45.430" style="s2">money in a day they tax people in order</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.600" end="00:28:46.870" style="s2">to remove money from circulation so the</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.430" end="00:28:49.090" style="s2">money has brought into circulation out</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.870" end="00:28:50.470" style="s2">of nothing and then they&#39;re done to take</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.090" end="00:28:56.890" style="s2">money out of circulation that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.470" end="00:28:59.890" style="s2">basic idea isn&#39;t it yeah yes and so we</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.890" end="00:29:02.200" style="s2">can make up whatever may we need we can</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.890" end="00:29:04.960" style="s2">move it from this top-down system of</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.200" end="00:29:08.290" style="s2">bankers on top we can start at the</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.960" end="00:29:10.270" style="s2">community level and be making up as much</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.290" end="00:29:11.900" style="s2">just like Benjamin Franklin said in</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.270" end="00:29:14.950" style="s2">those times back then he said</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.900" end="00:29:18.440" style="s2">we&#39;ve created some of currency to</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.950" end="00:29:20.600" style="s2">facilitate trade and industry and make</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.440" end="00:29:23.530" style="s2">sure everyone has their basic needs met</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.600" end="00:29:27.170" style="s2">we can make enough money to do that so</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.530" end="00:29:29.570" style="s2">so moving money free it&#39;s moving away</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.170" end="00:29:34.550" style="s2">from the banking system and we can keep</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.570" end="00:29:37.309" style="s2">a monetary system as we go about trying</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.550" end="00:29:40.100" style="s2">to produce an abundance of one product</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.309" end="00:29:42.050" style="s2">and then the next because you know I you</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.100" end="00:29:44.420" style="s2">don&#39;t ask people to believe you what do</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.050" end="00:29:46.580" style="s2">you say oh we can free to produce an</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.420" end="00:29:48.260" style="s2">abundance of things and we don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.580" end="00:29:49.880" style="s2">charge for it they&#39;re gonna go really</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.260" end="00:29:52.429" style="s2">well I&#39;m not sure about that</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.880" end="00:29:55.580" style="s2">well fine let&#39;s not ask all that in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.429" end="00:29:57.950" style="s2">beginning let&#39;s just say let&#39;s work at</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.580" end="00:30:02.059" style="s2">producing abundance with very little</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.950" end="00:30:04.100" style="s2">human labor involved and you know people</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.059" end="00:30:06.410" style="s2">working 10 hours re contributing to</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.100" end="00:30:09.380" style="s2">these projects when we can make enough</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.410" end="00:30:12.050" style="s2">you know using automation we can just</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.380" end="00:30:14.660" style="s2">take away the price tag one product</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.050" end="00:30:17.120" style="s2">after another and you know within if we</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.660" end="00:30:20.840" style="s2">switched into a system like this within</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.120" end="00:30:23.990" style="s2">a year or two if we localizing food food</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.840" end="00:30:25.460" style="s2">would be three ninety ninety percent of</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.990" end="00:30:26.809" style="s2">it we&#39;ve already could be we&#39;re already</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.460" end="00:30:28.429" style="s2">producing enough food for everyone on</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.809" end="00:30:30.110" style="s2">the planet which is 40 percent of it</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.429" end="00:30:31.670" style="s2">right I mean we&#39;re already working that</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.110" end="00:30:33.920" style="s2">there&#39;s already no but essentially in</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.670" end="00:30:36.429" style="s2">abundance you know doing all intensive</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.920" end="00:30:38.480" style="s2">press you know this is a really secure</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.429" end="00:30:40.100" style="s2">you&#39;ll probably already know this but</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.480" end="00:30:42.260" style="s2">the reason that we don&#39;t give our</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.100" end="00:30:44.030" style="s2">surplus food away so starving countries</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.260" end="00:30:46.550" style="s2">in the third world is this is lower the</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.030" end="00:30:54.320" style="s2">market price of food and therefore it</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.550" end="00:30:55.970" style="s2">can&#39;t be done just unbelievably nuts go</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.320" end="00:31:00.170" style="s2">okay you carry on because something you</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.970" end="00:31:02.030" style="s2">were saying just so you carry on I just</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.170" end="00:31:05.600" style="s2">want to turn you to make that point of</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.030" end="00:31:08.150" style="s2">what I&#39;m trying to push with this these</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.600" end="00:31:12.500" style="s2">policies here in my presidential</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.150" end="00:31:16.280" style="s2">campaign is not be free of money</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.500" end="00:31:19.240" style="s2">immediately but yeah just moving off</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.280" end="00:31:22.520" style="s2">immediately moving off the bankers</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.240" end="00:31:24.330" style="s2">immediately dissolving the banks and the</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.520" end="00:31:26.970" style="s2">corporations</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.330" end="00:31:29.850" style="s2">and and then getting rid of this</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.970" end="00:31:31.169" style="s2">hierarchy this pyramid with the</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.850" end="00:31:33.830" style="s2">government and the president the</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.169" end="00:31:36.029" style="s2">Congress and the lawmakers in the courts</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.830" end="00:31:39.330" style="s2">trickling down to the people at the</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.029" end="00:31:42.000" style="s2">bottom we have to flip that over we have</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.330" end="00:31:44.190" style="s2">to give control to the communities yes</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.000" end="00:31:45.840" style="s2">lots of little hierarchies community the</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.190" end="00:31:47.850" style="s2">community hierarchies lots and lots of</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.840" end="00:31:49.529" style="s2">little ones back on top of each other as</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.850" end="00:31:51.630" style="s2">larger Brockett projects need to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.529" end="00:31:53.010" style="s2">undertaken wider range of collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.630" end="00:31:56.100" style="s2">you can stack these little things on top</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.010" end="00:31:59.190" style="s2">of each other absolutely right and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.100" end="00:32:02.429" style="s2">it can focus down in the pyramid - we</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.190" end="00:32:06.389" style="s2">have a a resource management team I was</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.429" end="00:32:08.419" style="s2">calling it in 2016 and now I&#39;m saying we</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.389" end="00:32:10.980" style="s2">could call it a council we can have a</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.419" end="00:32:14.460" style="s2">council of elders or a Council of</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.980" end="00:32:16.320" style="s2">experts that we nominate because I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.460" end="00:32:19.320" style="s2">know if you saw in my campaign or on my</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.320" end="00:32:22.409" style="s2">website I&#39;m when I&#39;m talking about it so</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.320" end="00:32:26.789" style="s2">let&#39;s you not a president electing a new</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.409" end="00:32:30.000" style="s2">socio-economic system for president a</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.789" end="00:32:31.440" style="s2">system that does not need a president</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.000" end="00:32:34.380" style="s2">and you know when you talk to the</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.440" end="00:32:35.880" style="s2">anarchists or other words they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.380" end="00:32:38.010" style="s2">want a president and there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.880" end="00:32:41.850" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of reasons that makes a</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.010" end="00:32:44.940" style="s2">lot of sense to not have you know our</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.850" end="00:32:50.460" style="s2">supreme leader our king or our president</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.940" end="00:32:53.639" style="s2">and instead nominate people in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.460" end="00:32:56.279" style="s2">different fields no heavy Department of</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.639" end="00:32:58.980" style="s2">Earth Sciences and clean water and</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.279" end="00:33:01.620" style="s2">Atmospheric Sciences and get people who</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.980" end="00:33:04.049" style="s2">are experts like a dozen people a</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.620" end="00:33:06.389" style="s2">Department of Peace Andrey nominate</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.049" end="00:33:08.639" style="s2">people to do that and they don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.389" end="00:33:10.559" style="s2">do it for long just too much for a year</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.639" end="00:33:12.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of you know until the</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.559" end="00:33:13.919" style="s2">project is done and then the institution</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.240" end="00:33:15.510" style="s2">is dissolved because the projects done</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.919" end="00:33:16.950" style="s2">right institutions don&#39;t need to last</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.510" end="00:33:18.179" style="s2">forever they need to last for as long as</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.950" end="00:33:19.529" style="s2">they&#39;re useful and then they can be</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.179" end="00:33:22.980" style="s2">dissolved and we move on you know I mean</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.529" end="00:33:25.139" style="s2">fluid fluid yeah so yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.980" end="00:33:29.039" style="s2">I think a key point as well just going</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.139" end="00:33:31.769" style="s2">back to what you were saying they you</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.039" end="00:33:34.080" style="s2">would you would also be by changing the</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.769" end="00:33:36.090" style="s2">focus of society so dissolving the</p>

<p begin="00:36:58.779" end="00:37:02.170" style="s2">something that came to my attention just</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.699" end="00:37:03.729" style="s2">talking about going back a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.170" end="00:37:04.689" style="s2">talking about political processes</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.729" end="00:37:06.249" style="s2">there&#39;s something that came to my</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.689" end="00:37:08.589" style="s2">attention a little while ago as a woman</p>

<p begin="00:37:25.660" end="00:37:34.900" style="s2">right is what they&#39;re sort of pushing</p>

<p begin="00:37:45.999" end="00:37:49.689" style="s2">point I want to make about this was that</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.380" end="00:37:51.039" style="s2">from what I understand and listen I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.689" end="00:37:52.449" style="s2">only seen a few reports about it from</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.039" end="00:37:54.400" style="s2">what I understand this is a real</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.449" end="00:37:56.949" style="s2">grassroots movement and their support</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.400" end="00:37:58.239" style="s2">came from not raising lots and lots of</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.949" end="00:38:00.069" style="s2">money and buying lots and lots of TV</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.239" end="00:38:02.559" style="s2">time and sending around lots of leaflets</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.069" end="00:38:04.269" style="s2">but by recruiting lots of people to go</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.559" end="00:38:05.780" style="s2">and knock on doors and actually talk to</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.269" end="00:38:07.520" style="s2">people and you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.780" end="00:38:09.980" style="s2">town hall meetings and this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.520" end="00:38:11.720" style="s2">thing and build support by actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.980" end="00:38:13.490" style="s2">interfacing with the people that are</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.720" end="00:38:15.940" style="s2">going to be voting for you</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.490" end="00:38:18.560" style="s2">and I I wonder if there is some</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.940" end="00:38:21.140" style="s2">relationship possibly to be formed</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.560" end="00:38:23.570" style="s2">because I think in many ways you or the</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.140" end="00:38:25.280" style="s2">RBE movement and and they are very much</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.570" end="00:38:27.790" style="s2">on the same page in a lot of ways I mean</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.280" end="00:38:31.480" style="s2">I know they still have to see the the</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.790" end="00:38:34.940" style="s2">necessity to get rid of the money market</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.480" end="00:38:36.680" style="s2">but but nevertheless there&#39;s potential</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.940" end="00:38:40.400" style="s2">alliance to be made there what do you</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.680" end="00:38:43.010" style="s2">think you know it&#39;s just really still</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.400" end="00:38:46.790" style="s2">stuck within our two-party system and</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.010" end="00:38:49.070" style="s2">the Democrats and they can they will</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.790" end="00:38:51.680" style="s2">never talk about the central bankers</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.070" end="00:38:54.200" style="s2">getting rid of the Fed will never talk</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.680" end="00:38:57.170" style="s2">about the corporate state controlling</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.200" end="00:38:59.240" style="s2">every branch of government now and if</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.170" end="00:39:02.650" style="s2">they get elected like you were saying</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.240" end="00:39:04.640" style="s2">that the structure is still in place</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.650" end="00:39:07.190" style="s2">which is going to prevent them from</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.640" end="00:39:10.040" style="s2">really coming up with much change</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.190" end="00:39:12.530" style="s2">they&#39;ll be small little changes little</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.040" end="00:39:14.810" style="s2">band-aids we put on the system but</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.530" end="00:39:20.510" style="s2">nothing is going to really change that</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.810" end="00:39:23.120" style="s2">much no I I don&#39;t really I can&#39;t see</p>

<p begin="00:39:27.050" end="00:39:32.260" style="s2">need to do is the only thing we can do</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.020" end="00:39:35.120" style="s2">to get out of this system as I said</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.260" end="00:39:37.880" style="s2">dissolve the banking institutions and</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.120" end="00:39:40.610" style="s2">dissolve the corporations and this is</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.880" end="00:39:42.230" style="s2">also you know I don&#39;t talk about how the</p>

<p begin="00:41:44.539" end="00:41:48.229" style="s2">check nothing much could change that it</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.369" end="00:41:49.789" style="s2">could keep going on for them and then</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.229" end="00:41:51.650" style="s2">enough people said wait a minute you</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.789" end="00:41:56.539" style="s2">know you know there&#39;s nothing in there</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.650" end="00:41:59.329" style="s2">to protect individual freedoms and so we</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.539" end="00:42:01.789" style="s2">need something we&#39;ll call the Bill of</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.329" end="00:42:04.999" style="s2">Rights and this came about three years</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.789" end="00:42:06.529" style="s2">after the Constitution enough people</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.999" end="00:42:09.440" style="s2">finally got in there know we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.529" end="00:42:12.739" style="s2">have freedom of the press freedom of</p>

<p begin="00:42:15.769" end="00:42:22.130" style="s2">in the Bill of Rights which became the</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.829" end="00:42:23.660" style="s2">first 10 amendments to the Constitution</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.130" end="00:42:26.150" style="s2">so many people say over though the</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.660" end="00:42:28.430" style="s2">Constitution they&#39;re really saying we</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.150" end="00:42:30.710" style="s2">love the Bill of Rights those things are</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.430" end="00:42:33.830" style="s2">later the rest of it assists the</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.710" end="00:42:41.660" style="s2">structure in the government and you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.830" end="00:42:44.390" style="s2">that is to where it&#39;s just this</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.660" end="00:42:47.270" style="s2">hierarchy in control that makes sure</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.390" end="00:42:49.760" style="s2">nothing&#39;s going to change and so if we</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.270" end="00:42:52.070" style="s2">want the kind of change we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.760" end="00:42:54.650" style="s2">about we have to rewrite the</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.070" end="00:42:57.230" style="s2">Constitution we have to have an update</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.650" end="00:42:59.930" style="s2">we update everything else we have an</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.230" end="00:43:02.570" style="s2">updated this document in 240 years it</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.930" end="00:43:05.180" style="s2">desperately needs an update they had a</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.570" end="00:43:06.910" style="s2">whole while back about the approval</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.180" end="00:43:13.760" style="s2">rating for Congress</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.910" end="00:43:16.250" style="s2">92% only 8% approval ratings 92% of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.760" end="00:43:17.810" style="s2">people said you know this Congress had</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.250" end="00:43:20.360" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work it is broken</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.810" end="00:43:22.640" style="s2">it is dysfunctional and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.360" end="00:43:25.850" style="s2">Constitution that&#39;s the part we need to</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.640" end="00:43:27.980" style="s2">update certainly any amendments to the</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.850" end="00:43:29.210" style="s2">Constitution as I could be wrong about</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.980" end="00:43:31.040" style="s2">that it&#39;s something like this needs to</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.210" end="00:43:33.740" style="s2">be passed by two-thirds majority in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.040" end="00:43:35.330" style="s2">house right and compare the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.740" end="00:43:36.320" style="s2">need to actually change the Constitution</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.330" end="00:43:38.090" style="s2">and they&#39;re the ones that ain&#39;t gonna</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.320" end="00:43:40.160" style="s2">because that&#39;s what that&#39;s what puts</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.090" end="00:43:42.320" style="s2">them there right that&#39;s why we had to</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.160" end="00:43:43.940" style="s2">tear the new constitution back then</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.320" end="00:43:46.520" style="s2">again I come back to my question before</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.940" end="00:43:48.320" style="s2">where does the authority come to create</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.520" end="00:43:50.240" style="s2">and impose that new constitution I mean</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.320" end="00:43:52.220" style="s2">what you&#39;re what you seem to be alluding</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.240" end="00:43:53.510" style="s2">to is revolution that&#39;s what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.220" end="00:43:54.770" style="s2">that&#39;s basically what you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.510" end="00:43:57.170" style="s2">about right is some form of popular</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.770" end="00:43:58.280" style="s2">revolution where we say we over we</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.170" end="00:43:59.870" style="s2">basically overthrow the gun whether</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.280" end="00:44:01.490" style="s2">violently or not but basically we</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.870" end="00:44:04.670" style="s2">overthrow the government in some way and</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.490" end="00:44:06.170" style="s2">we install a new set of rules a new</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.670" end="00:44:11.180" style="s2">constitution that&#39;s what you&#39;re talking</p>

<p begin="00:49:24.000" end="00:49:28.260" style="s2">something called the resource-based</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.080" end="00:49:30.870" style="s2">economy&#39; game where I had a little game</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.260" end="00:49:35.460" style="s2">board and I rolled the dice and I had</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.870" end="00:49:38.910" style="s2">piles the WTF pile you know the problems</p>

<p begin="00:49:41.130" end="00:49:53.430" style="s2">question would be you know does the for</p>

<p begin="00:49:55.230" end="00:50:00.030" style="s2">whole thing and each one was about 10</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.570" end="00:50:02.970" style="s2">minutes the number by nine of them and</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.030" end="00:50:04.650" style="s2">so it was about an hour and 45 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.970" end="00:50:07.890" style="s2">when I got it finished and then I</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.650" end="00:50:09.750" style="s2">shortened it down to 45 minutes and that</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.890" end="00:50:12.570" style="s2">was the first thing that I did was this</p>

<p begin="00:58:06.110" end="00:58:11.880" style="s2">when we&#39;re in a system</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.370" end="00:58:12.450" style="s2">this just got us it&#39;s just holding us</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.880" end="00:58:14.580" style="s2">back</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.450" end="00:58:16.230" style="s2">so correct me if I&#39;m wrong because I am</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.580" end="00:58:18.390" style="s2">detecting a little bit of frustration in</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.230" end="00:58:21.000" style="s2">you here because on the one hand you</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.390" end="00:58:22.860" style="s2">agree the top-down institutional driven</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.000" end="00:58:26.820" style="s2">chain not possibly happened right</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.860" end="00:58:28.980" style="s2">because the institutions are the did the</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.820" end="00:58:31.170" style="s2">other distillation of the very</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.980" end="00:58:33.450" style="s2">structures that trying to overturn and</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.170" end="00:58:36.860" style="s2">yet at the same time at a grassroots</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.450" end="00:58:39.390" style="s2">individual small group level we are a</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.860" end="00:58:41.490" style="s2">powerless and B sometimes doing more</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.390" end="00:58:44.610" style="s2">harm than good by trying to by trying to</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.490" end="00:58:46.800" style="s2">change at you know at a ground floor</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.610" end="00:58:48.840" style="s2">level and so where does that you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.800" end="00:58:51.210" style="s2">that that seems to me to be a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.840" end="00:58:54.090" style="s2">Mexican standoff whatever it is they</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.210" end="00:58:57.180" style="s2">call it a chest yeah I know I know I</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.090" end="00:58:58.500" style="s2">gave her sorry so I don&#39;t know about you</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.180" end="00:59:00.230" style="s2">and not about me but I gave a talk</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.500" end="00:59:03.420" style="s2">fairly recently at a zeitgeist</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.230" end="00:59:04.800" style="s2">conference and this was kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.420" end="00:59:07.140" style="s2">point that I was making is that the</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.800" end="00:59:10.650" style="s2">individual does certainly feel like they</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.140" end="00:59:14.010" style="s2">stand powerless against this diet via</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.650" end="00:59:17.760" style="s2">mouth of a monster right yeah and so the</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.010" end="00:59:20.160" style="s2">only thing you can do same time is doing</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.760" end="00:59:24.480" style="s2">it enrich the meaningfulness of your own</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.160" end="00:59:27.390" style="s2">life is to take it upon yourself to go</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.480" end="00:59:29.430" style="s2">on what I conceptualize as Joseph</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.390" end="00:59:31.740" style="s2">Campbell&#39;s hero&#39;s journey answer to</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.430" end="00:59:34.470" style="s2">embark that hero&#39;s journey you know what</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.740" end="00:59:36.780" style="s2">I mean see yourself as you know the</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.470" end="00:59:39.810" style="s2">transformative agent in this world</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.780" end="00:59:42.330" style="s2">confront your demons confront your dark</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.810" end="00:59:44.430" style="s2">side you know what I mean wrestle</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.330" end="00:59:46.740" style="s2">through those things acknowledge the</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.430" end="00:59:50.010" style="s2">shadow that drives you the shadows that</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.740" end="00:59:52.290" style="s2">drive society and and and create one</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.010" end="00:59:54.510" style="s2">little tiny island of light in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.290" end="00:59:56.340" style="s2">darkness right and then when you have</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.510" end="00:59:59.790" style="s2">done that when you are if when you have</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.340" end="01:00:02.280" style="s2">made yourself into a fit agent for</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.790" end="01:00:05.280" style="s2">positive change in this world then that</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.280" end="01:00:06.630" style="s2">will by its very nature radiate out to</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.280" end="01:00:09.720" style="s2">others who do you know what I mean and</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.630" end="01:00:10.619" style="s2">so yeah and I know it&#39;s slow and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.720" end="01:00:12.329" style="s2">agonizing</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.619" end="01:00:15.990" style="s2">you think God you know it&#39;s one person</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.329" end="01:00:18.480" style="s2">in eight billion and it&#39;s the only way I</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.990" end="01:00:20.490" style="s2">see it maybe fantastical it may be you</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.480" end="01:00:25.130" style="s2">know fairy tale but it is the only way I</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.490" end="01:00:27.150" style="s2">see is at their individual</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.130" end="01:00:29.549" style="s2">self-actualization kind of point you</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.150" end="01:00:31.079" style="s2">know what I mean it yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.549" end="01:00:33.480" style="s2">huge burden on the individual it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.079" end="01:00:37.759" style="s2">massive acts of responsibility you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.480" end="01:00:39.660" style="s2">taking one of the big problems I kind of</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.759" end="01:00:41.849" style="s2">this is another part of the Mexican</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.660" end="01:00:44.130" style="s2">standoff is that on the one hand we have</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.849" end="01:00:47.249" style="s2">no hope of institutional top-down</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.130" end="01:00:49.499" style="s2">meaningful goods change taking place and</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.249" end="01:00:51.619" style="s2">at the same time we have been very</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.499" end="01:00:54.180" style="s2">thoroughly habituated to rely on</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.619" end="01:00:55.920" style="s2">top-down institutional driven change to</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.180" end="01:00:58.349" style="s2">make changes in society right it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.920" end="01:00:59.730" style="s2">only way for changes to come about is</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.349" end="01:01:01.470" style="s2">that government makes a new law or</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.730" end="01:01:05.640" style="s2">government start you know legislation</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.470" end="01:01:07.019" style="s2">whatever so again this leads us to this</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.640" end="01:01:09.029" style="s2">point where on the one hand we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.019" end="01:01:12.019" style="s2">waiting for top-down shame on the other</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.029" end="01:01:15.890" style="s2">hand top-down strange ain&#39;t never coming</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.019" end="01:01:18.930" style="s2">yeah I know and it&#39;s frustrating for</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.890" end="01:01:22.829" style="s2">everyone all of us in this movement you</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.930" end="01:01:25.259" style="s2">know we get positive you have days where</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.829" end="01:01:27.239" style="s2">you you know you just getting input into</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.259" end="01:01:29.670" style="s2">it you see positive things that are</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.239" end="01:01:31.589" style="s2">being shared stories out there and you</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.670" end="01:01:33.599" style="s2">feel we&#39;re making our way long and we</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.589" end="01:01:35.430" style="s2">are weird people are getting more</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.599" end="01:01:38.220" style="s2">educated that we&#39;re making our way along</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.430" end="01:01:41.160" style="s2">and you know then the movements come</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.220" end="01:01:42.720" style="s2">along and occupy and extinction we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.160" end="01:01:45.749" style="s2">got all these things are coming along</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.720" end="01:01:48.569" style="s2">and I just see him as another straw on</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.749" end="01:01:51.839" style="s2">the back and at some point it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.569" end="01:01:55.829" style="s2">break and so when you&#39;re occupy kind of</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.839" end="01:01:57.450" style="s2">came and went that&#39;s okay I guess that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.829" end="01:02:00.329" style="s2">just a natural way that that was going</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.450" end="01:02:03.180" style="s2">to happen but it was a big straw that</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.329" end="01:02:04.470" style="s2">led to the night consciousness occupy it</p>

<p begin="01:04:36.690" end="01:04:43.490" style="s2">right we can dissolve the corporations</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.690" end="01:04:47.130" style="s2">and keep the same structures in place</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.490" end="01:04:49.740" style="s2">what another way of saying get rid of</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.130" end="01:04:51.839" style="s2">corporations be to say get rid of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.740" end="01:04:54.390" style="s2">profit motive within the doing of</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.839" end="01:04:57.119" style="s2">Commerce yeah the profit mode has to go</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.390" end="01:04:59.599" style="s2">3d what it&#39;s about right I mean the</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.119" end="01:05:02.309" style="s2">issue is is that is the need to make</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.599" end="01:05:04.020" style="s2">primarily short-term profits at any cost</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.309" end="01:05:05.730" style="s2">because now the next course is balance</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.020" end="01:05:07.770" style="s2">sheet is what&#39;s going to determine my</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.730" end="01:05:11.400" style="s2">bonus this year you know it&#39;s that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.770" end="01:05:14.849" style="s2">that kind of thinking that&#39;s when we</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.400" end="01:05:18.059" style="s2">move from a competitive economic system</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.849" end="01:05:21.000" style="s2">to a collaborative one the profit motive</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.059" end="01:05:23.940" style="s2">is gone we the profit motive has to go</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.000" end="01:05:26.819" style="s2">to corporate structure the bankers or we</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.940" end="01:05:28.680" style="s2">can make money a local level just to</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.819" end="01:05:31.349" style="s2">keep everybody going to make sure</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.680" end="01:05:34.260" style="s2">everybody has their basic needs met and</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.349" end="01:05:38.549" style="s2">to facilitate trade we keep money going</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.260" end="01:05:41.359" style="s2">for that but you know the profit motive</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.549" end="01:05:45.390" style="s2">has to go and in a collaborative society</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.359" end="01:05:47.579" style="s2">there yeah there is no profit motive and</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.390" end="01:05:49.470" style="s2">so that has to be the big change we have</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.579" end="01:05:53.390" style="s2">to move from competitive to</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.470" end="01:05:56.099" style="s2">collaborative from corporate control to</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.390" end="01:05:58.559" style="s2">community control everything has to be</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.099" end="01:06:01.740" style="s2">at a community level not too top-down</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.559" end="01:06:04.470" style="s2">anymore we control our own money system</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.740" end="01:06:06.029" style="s2">as long as we&#39;re going to need one so we</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.470" end="01:06:08.460" style="s2">can produce enough abundance we can get</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.029" end="01:06:11.309" style="s2">rid of it so we move from bankers to</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.460" end="01:06:15.599" style="s2">community money from corporations to</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.309" end="01:06:20.490" style="s2">community control from competition to of</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.599" end="01:06:22.529" style="s2">collaboration and from 40 hours we extol</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.490" end="01:06:24.750" style="s2">property to open sourcing and everything</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.529" end="01:06:29.549" style="s2">and so yeah absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.750" end="01:06:32.490" style="s2">my I keep coming back to where does the</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.549" end="01:06:34.049" style="s2">pressure for these changes to occur come</p>

<p begin="01:14:29.940" end="01:14:33.390" style="s2">to have any assets at the end of it so</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.620" end="01:14:35.010" style="s2">he strikes on the brilliant idea of</p>

<p begin="01:14:48.600" end="01:14:52.560" style="s2">there now that is the kind of campaign</p>

<p begin="01:23:12.540" end="01:23:18.300" style="s2">really have to get into localizing all</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.090" end="01:23:20.640" style="s2">as much production as we can because you</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.300" end="01:23:23.060" style="s2">know depending on corporations then to</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.640" end="01:23:25.170" style="s2">produce it in one place and ship it</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.060" end="01:23:26.940" style="s2">everywhere around the world you know</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.170" end="01:23:29.790" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s not a model that&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.940" end="01:23:32.130" style="s2">work so if we&#39;re every community is</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.790" end="01:23:34.469" style="s2">growing through around them and every</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.130" end="01:23:36.179" style="s2">community is growing hemp in the fields</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.469" end="01:23:39.750" style="s2">around them you&#39;re making clothes</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.179" end="01:23:43.469" style="s2">building materials energy purifying</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.750" end="01:23:45.659" style="s2">their own water absolutely yeah so we</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.469" end="01:23:46.980" style="s2">just gotta focus on that you know we</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.659" end="01:23:49.320" style="s2">could just keep doing what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.980" end="01:23:51.330" style="s2">and you know localization smashes the</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.320" end="01:23:53.190" style="s2">power of the corporations and and this</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.330" end="01:23:56.790" style="s2">is always where I get stuck you know I</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.190" end="01:23:58.560" style="s2">mean III the the the vision is is clear</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.790" end="01:24:00.860" style="s2">in my head the problems here are clear</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.560" end="01:24:05.280" style="s2">in my head but the mechanism by which</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.860" end="01:24:06.630" style="s2">you create the demand for the change</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.280" end="01:24:08.100" style="s2">that&#39;s the only way it comes about right</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.630" end="01:24:10.650" style="s2">is there is sufficient demand in the</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.100" end="01:24:14.010" style="s2">population the thing that&#39;s the only way</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.650" end="01:24:16.260" style="s2">it comes about and and the the mechanism</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.010" end="01:24:19.830" style="s2">by which you go about generating that</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.260" end="01:24:21.540" style="s2">demand remains unclear to me I I think</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.830" end="01:24:23.400" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna have to I think we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.540" end="01:24:26.219" style="s2">to have to elect a new system we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.400" end="01:24:30.060" style="s2">gonna say to people how badly do you</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.219" end="01:24:32.340" style="s2">want to you know to actually take care</p>

<p begin="01:24:45.730" end="01:24:56.110" style="s2">this then let&#39;s elect a system that will</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.100" end="01:24:58.120" style="s2">enable that and so electing a new system</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.110" end="01:25:00.010" style="s2">man that&#39;s right if we&#39;re not gonna do</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.120" end="01:25:03.370" style="s2">it that way it&#39;s going to be a</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.010" end="01:25:06.100" style="s2">revolution it&#39;s gonna come like try it</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.370" end="01:25:07.750" style="s2">with Hong Kong had a million people and</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.100" end="01:25:11.470" style="s2">then the next year they had two million</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.750" end="01:25:14.470" style="s2">people out in the streets protesting and</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.470" end="01:25:15.670" style="s2">you&#39;ve seen that Hong Kong you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.470" end="01:25:17.980" style="s2">coming we had more than a million people</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.670" end="01:25:19.870" style="s2">protesting the war or the Iraq war in</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.980" end="01:25:21.490" style="s2">the on the streets of London whenever it</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.870" end="01:25:23.310" style="s2">was ten years ago fifteen years ago</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.490" end="01:25:26.170" style="s2">whenever it was now my turn time goes by</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.310" end="01:25:27.460" style="s2">but you know it&#39;ll make any difference</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.170" end="01:25:28.810" style="s2">we still went to war in Iraq it made</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.460" end="01:25:30.100" style="s2">absolutely no bloody difference that</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.810" end="01:25:31.870" style="s2">three-quarters of the country was</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.100" end="01:25:33.940" style="s2">against it they didn&#39;t give a shit there</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.870" end="01:25:36.160" style="s2">was money to be made and there has been</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.940" end="01:25:40.480" style="s2">made to President Bush and whatever and</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.160" end="01:25:41.740" style="s2">so we went anyway just just coming back</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.480" end="01:25:44.170" style="s2">to the other thing that I wanted to talk</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.740" end="01:25:45.820" style="s2">to you about and sorry to keep coming</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.170" end="01:25:47.080" style="s2">back to my own idea but what did you</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.820" end="01:25:50.290" style="s2">think of what do you think of this sort</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.080" end="01:25:52.960" style="s2">of none of the above kind of banner as a</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.290" end="01:25:54.370" style="s2">starting point the reason I ask is let</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.960" end="01:25:56.830" style="s2">me just finish the question the reason I</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.370" end="01:25:58.660" style="s2">ask is that one of the things that has</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.830" end="01:25:59.860" style="s2">struck me in the four or five years that</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.660" end="01:26:01.720" style="s2">I&#39;ve been involved in the zeitgeist</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.860" end="01:26:04.810" style="s2">movement and the money free party and</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.720" end="01:26:07.300" style="s2">activism in general is the fractious</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.810" end="01:26:08.620" style="s2">nature of the activist community you</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.300" end="01:26:10.210" style="s2">know what I mean that the one group</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.620" end="01:26:11.860" style="s2">splinters off into two groups of</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.210" end="01:26:13.000" style="s2">splinters up into four groups because</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.860" end="01:26:15.550" style="s2">they each now develop their own</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.000" end="01:26:17.200" style="s2">particular concerns and they forget that</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.550" end="01:26:20.050" style="s2">actually we&#39;re all on the same team you</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.200" end="01:26:23.680" style="s2">know what I mean and that and the the</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.050" end="01:26:25.780" style="s2">the the uniting under one simple idea I</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.680" end="01:26:28.060" style="s2">mean this is what this is what occupy</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.780" end="01:26:29.470" style="s2">almost got right yeah they or they they</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.060" end="01:26:31.390" style="s2">they almost got it they got everyone</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.470" end="01:26:33.190" style="s2">other extinction rebellion you mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.390" end="01:26:36.070" style="s2">earlier on as well you know they&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.190" end="01:26:37.660" style="s2">one idea you know the government must do</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.070" end="01:26:39.070" style="s2">something about climate change I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.660" end="01:26:41.590" style="s2">don&#39;t I don&#39;t personally agree with</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.070" end="01:26:44.170" style="s2">their agenda but that&#39;s one side they</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.590" end="01:26:47.800" style="s2">have the strength of all united behind</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.170" end="01:26:49.250" style="s2">one clear unambiguous this is what we</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.800" end="01:26:51.440" style="s2">all want issue</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.250" end="01:26:53.090" style="s2">this is what the RBE and activist</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.440" end="01:26:54.740" style="s2">community in general has absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.090" end="01:26:56.570" style="s2">failed to do I mean even Jacque fresco</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.740" end="01:26:58.130" style="s2">and Peter Joseph managed to fall out</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.570" end="01:27:00.020" style="s2">about something or other god knows what</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.130" end="01:27:01.490" style="s2">it was you know you could make two more</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.020" end="01:27:04.520" style="s2">people more closely aligned than them</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.490" end="01:27:05.930" style="s2">right and yeah you know and I see this</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.520" end="01:27:07.070" style="s2">happen again and again and again and</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.930" end="01:27:08.330" style="s2">again and again I&#39;ve been part of the</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.070" end="01:27:10.220" style="s2">zeitgeist movement for four or five</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.330" end="01:27:11.960" style="s2">years now new people can&#39;t they drift</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.220" end="01:27:13.280" style="s2">into the movement and then they go off</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.960" end="01:27:14.720" style="s2">and they join other movements where they</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.280" end="01:27:16.970" style="s2">just drift away from it you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.720" end="01:27:18.380" style="s2">a there&#39;s an inability to hang on to</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.970" end="01:27:20.530" style="s2">people there&#39;s an inability to keep</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.380" end="01:27:23.660" style="s2">people engaged there&#39;s an inability to</p>

<p begin="01:27:23.660" end="01:27:30.470" style="s2">meaningful tasks that they the step</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.200" end="01:27:32.810" style="s2">towards you know the the final goal kind</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.470" end="01:27:34.550" style="s2">of thing and we&#39;re badly organized</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.810" end="01:27:37.570" style="s2">extinction rebellion did this extremely</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.550" end="01:27:39.290" style="s2">well extinction rebellion had regular</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.570" end="01:27:41.570" style="s2">meetings right where they would get</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.290" end="01:27:43.400" style="s2">together in a in a classroom or a town</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.570" end="01:27:45.170" style="s2">hall or a church all or someone&#39;s living</p>

<p begin="01:27:57.620" end="01:28:01.040" style="s2">to come up when you&#39;re out marching</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.970" end="01:28:04.520" style="s2">being an activist and it gives people a</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.040" end="01:28:06.380" style="s2">sense of ongoing continued meaningful</p>

<p begin="01:29:50.030" end="01:29:57.350" style="s2">afterwards yeah all right well people</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.110" end="01:30:00.800" style="s2">are just too controlled by the system</p>

<p begin="01:30:04.880" end="01:30:09.320" style="s2">able to see it right that&#39;s all job is</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.880" end="01:30:12.050" style="s2">to provide them with that vision that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.320" end="01:30:13.430" style="s2">that&#39;s all job yeah I know Colin was</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.050" end="01:30:16.700" style="s2">talking about you know trying to make a</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.430" end="01:30:18.650" style="s2">movie and TV t Venus Project has been</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.700" end="01:30:20.300" style="s2">talking about trying to make a movie as</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.650" end="01:30:22.280" style="s2">a way to get it in front of the people</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.300" end="01:30:25.220" style="s2">that people see what this could look</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.280" end="01:30:27.260" style="s2">like and Peter Joseph&#39;s project he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.220" end="01:30:29.620" style="s2">been working on forever here he&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.260" end="01:30:31.550" style="s2">try to do that</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.620" end="01:30:33.020" style="s2">yeah what&#39;s happening reading some</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.550" end="01:30:34.310" style="s2">reflections have you had any news on</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.020" end="01:30:38.300" style="s2">that do you know what&#39;s happening with</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.310" end="01:30:41.930" style="s2">that I just I just know that he&#39;s taking</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.300" end="01:30:43.760" style="s2">him he&#39;s sort of going one direction</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.930" end="01:30:47.930" style="s2">with it and then kind of maybe thinking</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.760" end="01:30:50.000" style="s2">not that might not quite working it a</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.930" end="01:30:53.570" style="s2">little bit back and forth I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.000" end="01:30:58.550" style="s2">if anybody&#39;s doing but it&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.570" end="01:31:00.980" style="s2">harder to put together a a movie project</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.550" end="01:31:03.170" style="s2">as opposed to a documentary you know dr.</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.980" end="01:31:05.630" style="s2">Harry fairly simple when you compared</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.170" end="01:31:07.970" style="s2">compared it to trying to put together a</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.630" end="01:31:09.980" style="s2">full-length feature film that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.970" end="01:31:13.550" style="s2">going to get people to come out and get</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.980" end="01:31:15.859" style="s2">engaged with you really need a plot and</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.550" end="01:31:19.429" style="s2">something to draw the draw people</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.859" end="01:31:23.239" style="s2">yeah then you need to just have the</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.429" end="01:31:26.149" style="s2">society as a backdrop sort of to the</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.239" end="01:31:28.399" style="s2">story anyway that&#39;s where he was talking</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.149" end="01:31:30.439" style="s2">about that or what Colin was talking</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.399" end="01:31:32.780" style="s2">about it I was going I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.439" end="01:31:34.359" style="s2">writing that script because because it&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.780" end="01:31:38.239" style="s2">be really hard I wrote a dozen</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.359" end="01:31:39.829" style="s2">screenplays when I was about 10 years</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.239" end="01:31:42.349" style="s2">when I was working it&#39;s writing</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.829" end="01:31:44.959" style="s2">screenplays and so I know how to do it</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.349" end="01:31:48.169" style="s2">and it&#39;s hard and I&#39;ve often thought</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.959" end="01:31:50.149" style="s2">about how how could you present it we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.169" end="01:31:53.389" style="s2">getting a story to get people involved</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.149" end="01:31:57.919" style="s2">and letting them see the society that</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.389" end="01:31:59.869" style="s2">has changed into this healthy yeah I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.919" end="01:32:01.820" style="s2">got a couple of sort of vague I did not</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.869" end="01:32:03.349" style="s2">now we won&#39;t go into it now but maybe we</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.820" end="01:32:04.579" style="s2">could discuss another time because I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.349" end="01:32:07.729" style="s2">actually got a couple of ideas for</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.579" end="01:32:10.099" style="s2">stories and I I I enjoy writing I&#39;ve no</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.729" end="01:32:11.689" style="s2">experience of writing screenplays but I</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.099" end="01:32:14.929" style="s2">enjoy writing and I like to think I have</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.689" end="01:32:17.989" style="s2">a reasonable facility with language we</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.929" end="01:32:19.280" style="s2">can I know you&#39;ve done your time and</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.989" end="01:32:20.599" style="s2">everything but we could maybe at some</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.280" end="01:32:21.979" style="s2">point in the future talk about maybe</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.599" end="01:32:24.859" style="s2">collaboration because I do have a couple</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.979" end="01:32:28.909" style="s2">of ideas for exactly that the context in</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.859" end="01:32:33.019" style="s2">which to present that sort of contrast</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.909" end="01:32:35.119" style="s2">between now and then not specific only a</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.019" end="01:32:40.039" style="s2">vague outline I can I see something</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.119" end="01:32:43.339" style="s2">vague our story with moving</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.039" end="01:32:49.669" style="s2">transitioning into this system but you</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.339" end="01:32:54.949" style="s2">know somebody that wants to try to hold</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.669" end="01:32:58.099" style="s2">back this change from happening and have</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.949" end="01:33:04.579" style="s2">some conflict there and then you know</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.099" end="01:33:06.679" style="s2">just very vague idea again it&#39;s fairly</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.579" end="01:33:09.079" style="s2">vague but I&#39;ve got this notion of an</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.679" end="01:33:10.820" style="s2">alien encounter kind of thing where</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.079" end="01:33:12.260" style="s2">whatever I mean come up with other</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.820" end="01:33:13.789" style="s2">storylines that go on between the</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.260" end="01:33:16.609" style="s2">protagonists but that the underlying</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.789" end="01:33:19.459" style="s2">thread is a sort of dialogue that goes</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.609" end="01:33:21.409" style="s2">on between the earth hero and the alien</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.459" end="01:33:22.999" style="s2">hero as to how things are in their</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.409" end="01:33:25.729" style="s2">worlds right and then the contrast</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.999" end="01:33:29.429" style="s2">between a genuinely civilized society</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.729" end="01:33:30.630" style="s2">and us can easily be drawn right and</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.429" end="01:33:31.980" style="s2">you know it can be too likable</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.630" end="01:33:35.010" style="s2">characters coming from two different</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.980" end="01:33:37.110" style="s2">worlds and and and you know and I think</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.010" end="01:33:38.699" style="s2">that it could be done quite nicely I</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.110" end="01:33:40.110" style="s2">think like that without a bit without it</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.699" end="01:33:42.390" style="s2">being Joey so as I say there&#39;s only a</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.110" end="01:33:45.060" style="s2">vague notion but I think it has some</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.390" end="01:33:46.710" style="s2">potential as a structure to exactly that</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.060" end="01:33:49.260" style="s2">show that content I mean Peter Joseph&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.710" end="01:33:52.800" style="s2">idea within two reflections is to do it</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.260" end="01:33:54.510" style="s2">as a sort of it happened in the past</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.800" end="01:33:56.370" style="s2">right telling the story about the</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.510" end="01:33:58.110" style="s2">transition which has already happened at</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.370" end="01:34:01.250" style="s2">some point in the past that was the idea</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.110" end="01:34:03.719" style="s2">within two reflections wasn&#39;t it I think</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.250" end="01:34:07.590" style="s2">even sure he never had you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.719" end="01:34:09.300" style="s2">never really going into it too much like</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.590" end="01:34:11.699" style="s2">three four years ago he made a trailer</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.300" end="01:34:12.989" style="s2">for it all right that was the last I</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.699" end="01:34:15.840" style="s2">heard he was supposed to come out early</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.989" end="01:34:17.520" style="s2">in 2017 then it was delayed a lot autumn</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.840" end="01:34:20.969" style="s2">to 17 and then I haven&#39;t heard anything</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.520" end="01:34:22.710" style="s2">since so long similarly is called the</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.969" end="01:34:24.179" style="s2">shift that they were trying to raise</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.710" end="01:34:25.380" style="s2">funds I saw a couple of trailers for</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.179" end="01:34:26.969" style="s2">that on YouTube and again it looks</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.380" end="01:34:28.260" style="s2">excellent but again as far as I&#39;m aware</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.969" end="01:34:30.630" style="s2">it didn&#39;t actually amount to anything</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.260" end="01:34:32.219" style="s2">right I remember that - I remember</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.630" end="01:34:35.690" style="s2">seeing that trailer and I thought it</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.219" end="01:34:39.929" style="s2">should be a good idea a filmmaker from</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.690" end="01:34:49.320" style="s2">Finland or someone of the Norwegian</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.929" end="01:34:50.969" style="s2">countries I think anyway well we&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.320" end="01:34:53.760" style="s2">to talk about that that might be a fun</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.969" end="01:34:56.940" style="s2">project for me to take on after this one</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.760" end="01:35:00.510" style="s2">I know I know from this year and a half</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.940" end="01:35:04.920" style="s2">now I&#39;m just going to be trying to</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.510" end="01:35:08.429" style="s2">promote a new you know a new system that</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.920" end="01:35:11.040" style="s2">people can envision and then I can try</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.429" end="01:35:14.370" style="s2">to just be talking about on as many</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.040" end="01:35:18.449" style="s2">platforms out there as I can and you</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.370" end="01:35:20.219" style="s2">know presenting this vision so yes let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.449" end="01:35:22.800" style="s2">finish where we started then and go back</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.219" end="01:35:26.460" style="s2">to talking about your campaign what</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.800" end="01:35:28.230" style="s2">platforms do you get access to that you</p>
<p begin="01:35:26.460" end="01:35:30.150" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t otherwise have access to as a</p>

<p begin="01:41:56.520" end="01:41:59.550" style="s2">like the simplicity of none of the above</p>
<p begin="01:41:57.870" end="01:42:02.070" style="s2">it seems to me a good starting point we</p>
<p begin="01:41:59.550" end="01:42:04.650" style="s2">reject this and now let&#39;s have a serious</p>
<p begin="01:42:02.070" end="01:42:06.810" style="s2">conversation about what we want to</p>
<p begin="01:42:04.650" end="01:42:08.910" style="s2">replace it with you know what I mean no</p>

<p begin="01:42:08.910" end="01:42:11.460" style="s2">about it I&#39;ve been thinking about this</p>
<p begin="01:42:10.110" end="01:42:13.590" style="s2">for a year or so you know the more I</p>
<p begin="01:42:11.460" end="01:42:15.570" style="s2">think about none of the above and it</p>
<p begin="01:42:13.590" end="01:42:16.860" style="s2">started off as a really silly idea right</p>
<p begin="01:42:15.570" end="01:42:18.840" style="s2">because it&#39;s Brewster&#39;s Millions right</p>

<p begin="01:42:23.010" end="01:42:27.480" style="s2">revolutionary act you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="01:42:24.930" end="01:42:29.400" style="s2">rather than people taking to the streets</p>
<p begin="01:42:27.480" end="01:42:31.020" style="s2">with tear gas and guns and patterns and</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.400" end="01:42:33.480" style="s2">throwing rocks at each other and so on</p>
<p begin="01:42:31.020" end="01:42:35.130" style="s2">which is usually what it generates into</p>
<p begin="01:42:33.480" end="01:42:37.470" style="s2">when people get really really really</p>
<p begin="01:42:35.130" end="01:42:40.230" style="s2">fucked off with things right if instead</p>
<p begin="01:42:37.470" end="01:42:42.470" style="s2">of their that protest that anger that</p>
<p begin="01:42:40.230" end="01:42:45.240" style="s2">dissatisfaction could be channeled into</p>
<p begin="01:42:42.470" end="01:42:46.770" style="s2">just know just know and I know</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.240" end="01:42:48.810" style="s2">campaigning for a negative is is</p>
<p begin="01:42:46.770" end="01:42:50.280" style="s2">generally speaking a terrible thing to</p>
<p begin="01:42:48.810" end="01:42:52.530" style="s2">do I completely understand nation would</p>
<p begin="01:42:50.280" end="01:42:56.490" style="s2">be campaigning for positive change and</p>

<p begin="01:42:56.490" end="01:43:03.930" style="s2">it is to me this is a positive act of</p>
<p begin="01:42:59.700" end="01:43:05.700" style="s2">rejection in order to begin the</p>
<p begin="01:43:03.930" end="01:43:06.960" style="s2">transition to the new thing with it</p>
<p begin="01:43:05.700" end="01:43:08.340" style="s2">because you have to do that as you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:43:06.960" end="01:43:09.930" style="s2">already said there&#39;s no way it happens</p>
<p begin="01:43:08.340" end="01:43:13.440" style="s2">under this system and so you have to</p>
<p begin="01:43:09.930" end="01:43:15.060" style="s2">stop its first before you learn and I</p>
<p begin="01:43:13.440" end="01:43:16.350" style="s2">think none of the above is potentially</p>
<p begin="01:43:15.060" end="01:43:18.930" style="s2">an effective way to do that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:16.350" end="01:43:20.580" style="s2">something that everyone in the RBA</p>
<p begin="01:43:18.930" end="01:43:22.380" style="s2">community can get you because we all</p>
<p begin="01:43:20.580" end="01:43:25.890" style="s2">think that this has to fucking go</p>
<p begin="01:43:22.380" end="01:43:31.110" style="s2">right we all think man yeah so I think</p>
<p begin="01:43:25.890" end="01:43:33.750" style="s2">it could be an effective uniting yeah if</p>
