<p begin="00:00:17.490" end="00:00:21.359" style="s2">we are discussing the question what are</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.439" end="00:00:24.990" style="s2">your thoughts and feelings on communism</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.359" end="00:00:26.609" style="s2">or Marxism and we generally each take up</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.990" end="00:00:28.920" style="s2">to five minutes you&#39;re also welcome to</p>

<p begin="00:00:37.020" end="00:00:41.370" style="s2">still be part of the discussion</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.129" end="00:00:43.649" style="s2">discussion at the end so if either of</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.370" end="00:00:46.280" style="s2">you would like to go first or I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.649" end="00:00:54.510" style="s2">open to going first</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.280" end="00:00:57.059" style="s2">uncle s start and I&#39;ll know I think I</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.510" end="00:01:01.260" style="s2">can be brief because I actually haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.059" end="00:01:03.300" style="s2">read Marx I haven&#39;t studied communism I</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.260" end="00:01:07.500" style="s2">mean other than just the general</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.300" end="00:01:10.320" style="s2">awareness but my so my perspective is I</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.500" end="00:01:12.900" style="s2">was I was impacted most by watching</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.320" end="00:01:16.140" style="s2">people debate it you know the the sense</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.900" end="00:01:20.670" style="s2">of you don&#39;t really understand what it</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.140" end="00:01:23.310" style="s2">is you&#39;re you&#39;re using the historical</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.670" end="00:01:26.159" style="s2">what what has happened with communism as</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.310" end="00:01:27.420" style="s2">a as a critique of Marx and people say</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.159" end="00:01:31.619" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a lot of ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.420" end="00:01:33.780" style="s2">marks that don&#39;t get aired I am sure</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.619" end="00:01:38.420" style="s2">that that&#39;s true I&#39;m sure that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.780" end="00:01:40.770" style="s2">lot there that is worth looking into and</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.420" end="00:01:42.329" style="s2">that&#39;s the piece that I&#39;d really like to</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.770" end="00:01:43.950" style="s2">understand for people to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.329" end="00:01:47.640" style="s2">bring that forward what are the things</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.950" end="00:01:50.100" style="s2">that would be worth considering I know</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.640" end="00:01:54.320" style="s2">that some of the criticism is the way</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.100" end="00:01:56.640" style="s2">that Marx is presented is through the</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.320" end="00:01:58.619" style="s2">through the historical impact you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.640" end="00:02:02.329" style="s2">that communism has been has been</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.619" end="00:02:04.770" style="s2">terrible and it&#39;s and it has been</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.329" end="00:02:08.129" style="s2">attempted to be implemented in a period</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.770" end="00:02:10.679" style="s2">of time when we had when the Industrial</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.129" end="00:02:13.319" style="s2">Revolution was brand-new we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.679" end="00:02:15.870" style="s2">learning new social technologies</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.319" end="00:02:18.090" style="s2">so there is a lot that is like how</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.870" end="00:02:23.849" style="s2">possible would it be to even implement</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.090" end="00:02:26.069" style="s2">ideas of better ideals you know how do</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.849" end="00:02:28.609" style="s2">how do we make things better for the</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.069" end="00:02:32.040" style="s2">world I said there&#39;s a lot that I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.609" end="00:02:36.629" style="s2">is worthwhile if we can really move past</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.040" end="00:02:39.420" style="s2">a sense of everything was good back then</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.629" end="00:02:41.579" style="s2">or you know that that marks is stated in</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.420" end="00:02:44.549" style="s2">a way that if we could just implement it</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.579" end="00:02:47.639" style="s2">purely then we would see something I my</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.549" end="00:02:49.260" style="s2">my own sense I&#39;ll say this and this</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.639" end="00:02:51.959" style="s2">isn&#39;t really so much communism or</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.260" end="00:02:55.769" style="s2">Marxism specifically but my idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.959" end="00:02:59.730" style="s2">our desire for utopia I actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.769" end="00:03:03.389" style="s2">exploring my own desire for utopia I see</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.730" end="00:03:05.069" style="s2">a fallacy and that I see that I have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.389" end="00:03:11.209" style="s2">vision for something wonderful that</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.069" end="00:03:11.209" style="s2">could happen if only other people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.349" end="00:03:22.290" style="s2">selfishness didn&#39;t interfere with my</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.250" end="00:03:25.409" style="s2">beneficence it&#39;s like hmm</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.290" end="00:03:28.229" style="s2">I think I&#39;m looking at this from a</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.409" end="00:03:30.870" style="s2">particular lens that is only seeing my</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.229" end="00:03:33.239" style="s2">my positive attributes and everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.870" end="00:03:35.639" style="s2">is negative attributes and trying to</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.239" end="00:03:40.019" style="s2">balance it in that way rather than</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.639" end="00:03:42.720" style="s2">really recognizing how do I also face</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.019" end="00:03:45.419" style="s2">the challenge of overcoming my shadows</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.720" end="00:03:47.639" style="s2">and help why&#39;s everyone up to be their</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.419" end="00:03:49.290" style="s2">best Ellison and and overcome their</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.639" end="00:03:51.750" style="s2">shadows in a way that they would want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.290" end="00:03:55.290" style="s2">so I think that that I think is the</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.750" end="00:03:58.260" style="s2">essence of what is difficult to achieve</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.290" end="00:04:03.959" style="s2">by when I when I think of achieving</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.260" end="00:04:06.060" style="s2">utopia yeah that actually it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.959" end="00:04:09.239" style="s2">somewhat embodied in the rule Omega as</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.060" end="00:04:11.180" style="s2">well as I&#39;m engaged in rule awake I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.239" end="00:04:15.419" style="s2">realizing I&#39;m doing that I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.180" end="00:04:16.620" style="s2">noticing where am I not giving the best</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.419" end="00:04:18.299" style="s2">benefit of the doubt where am I not</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.620" end="00:04:19.949" style="s2">actually meeting the person and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.299" end="00:04:22.469" style="s2">it&#39;s said interacting with the idea</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.949" end="00:04:25.320" style="s2">other person the same thing is true with</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.469" end="00:04:27.430" style="s2">utopia where am i dealing with the idea</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.320" end="00:04:30.379" style="s2">in my head about what&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.430" end="00:04:34.099" style="s2">rather than actually and encountering</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.379" end="00:04:37.280" style="s2">the actual world actual people actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.099" end="00:04:39.650" style="s2">my actual self in this moment and it</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.280" end="00:04:42.800" style="s2">seems that that in the discussion that I</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.650" end="00:04:44.449" style="s2">saw a flare up that was the case it</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.800" end="00:04:46.250" style="s2">seemed like a more so we were dealing</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.449" end="00:04:54.110" style="s2">with the idea at it rather than the</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.250" end="00:04:55.759" style="s2">actuality I&#39;ll pause there all right</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.110" end="00:05:01.280" style="s2">thank you David do you still want me to</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.759" end="00:05:04.520" style="s2">go first actually so I think that was</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.280" end="00:05:07.340" style="s2">beautifully said I agree I&#39;m somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.520" end="00:05:10.580" style="s2">in those lines as well I do not know</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.340" end="00:05:11.960" style="s2">much about Marxism communism except what</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.580" end="00:05:15.379" style="s2">I&#39;ve learned in school what we know from</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.960" end="00:05:18.139" style="s2">history from reading and I think that I</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.379" end="00:05:19.520" style="s2">tend to do the same thing and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.139" end="00:05:22.580" style="s2">people tend to do the same thing as is</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.520" end="00:05:27.740" style="s2">sort of like judge it based on</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.580" end="00:05:30.759" style="s2">historical events I I believe that it</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.740" end="00:05:34.550" style="s2">has a lot of good in it but in the same</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.759" end="00:05:36.800" style="s2">train as David I would say that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.550" end="00:05:40.219" style="s2">also it has a lot of barriers and</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.800" end="00:05:47.419" style="s2">challenges because it&#39;s the Stila system</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.219" end="00:05:54.110" style="s2">it&#39;s so system so I I value freedom</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.419" end="00:05:56.960" style="s2">that&#39;s one of my values I see that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.110" end="00:05:57.469" style="s2">a system that doesn&#39;t give much way to</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.960" end="00:06:01.849" style="s2">freedom</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.469" end="00:06:04.490" style="s2">freedom of speech freedom of of being</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.849" end="00:06:08.529" style="s2">innovative creating you know having</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.490" end="00:06:11.300" style="s2">creating your own having your own</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.529" end="00:06:13.759" style="s2">resources and creating your own you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.300" end="00:06:17.139" style="s2">restaurant or whatever it may be so in</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.759" end="00:06:21.009" style="s2">that sense I I think that it could be</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.139" end="00:06:24.680" style="s2">something that can be used but not fully</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.009" end="00:06:27.139" style="s2">I think that we can draw a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.680" end="00:06:30.440" style="s2">positivity from it you can draw certain</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.139" end="00:06:32.719" style="s2">concepts from it but I think that we may</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.440" end="00:06:38.050" style="s2">also need to add to it in order for it</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.719" end="00:06:40.009" style="s2">to work in a way that it will work in</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.050" end="00:06:45.050" style="s2">creating</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.009" end="00:06:46.669" style="s2">utopia if that&#39;s possible yeah that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.050" end="00:06:49.339" style="s2">lease on it so far I have a lot of views</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.669" end="00:06:52.129" style="s2">on it but so far that&#39;s like the surface</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.339" end="00:06:53.689" style="s2">for me I do not know much about it I</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.129" end="00:06:57.979" style="s2">know a little bit about it I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.689" end="00:07:00.020" style="s2">fascinated by the same with the debates</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.979" end="00:07:03.889" style="s2">and people discussing it and their</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.020" end="00:07:07.129" style="s2">points of view and I&#39;m I can&#39;t say that</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.889" end="00:07:10.969" style="s2">I am against it or for it I just think</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.129" end="00:07:13.520" style="s2">that is in itself it&#39;s flawed and I</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.969" end="00:07:16.939" style="s2">think that it may need to be maybe</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.520" end="00:07:23.809" style="s2">tweaked a little bit or expanded upon or</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.939" end="00:07:26.089" style="s2">something like that alright thank you</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.809" end="00:07:28.399" style="s2">and I will take a turn since there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.089" end="00:07:32.149" style="s2">only three of us</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.399" end="00:07:36.409" style="s2">my similar to both of you I think there</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.149" end="00:07:38.360" style="s2">is a lot of amazing qualities in Marxism</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.409" end="00:07:41.330" style="s2">and communism as it is written out in</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.360" end="00:07:43.099" style="s2">its purest form the fact that we can</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.330" end="00:07:46.599" style="s2">come together and work for the for the</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.099" end="00:07:50.719" style="s2">group and overcome our selfishness and</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.599" end="00:07:53.569" style="s2">find a path that&#39;s best for everyone and</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.719" end="00:07:56.029" style="s2">living towards this like common utopia I</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.569" end="00:07:57.589" style="s2">also think when it&#39;s been implemented in</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.029" end="00:08:00.110" style="s2">the real world whether the letter of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.589" end="00:08:01.789" style="s2">law or not human nature gets in the way</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.110" end="00:08:03.800" style="s2">we take on power and we don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.789" end="00:08:05.930" style="s2">give it back we want people we want to</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.800" end="00:08:07.999" style="s2">control people and force them to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.930" end="00:08:09.620" style="s2">selfless force them to work for the</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.999" end="00:08:12.830" style="s2">greater the greater part of the group</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.620" end="00:08:15.529" style="s2">and in doing so take away the beauty</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.830" end="00:08:16.819" style="s2">that is there take away the individual</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.529" end="00:08:19.159" style="s2">beauty and the beauty of the collective</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.819" end="00:08:21.649" style="s2">like that we don&#39;t get the innovation we</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.159" end="00:08:23.569" style="s2">don&#39;t get when we don&#39;t have personal</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.649" end="00:08:25.009" style="s2">freedom when someone else is dictating</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.569" end="00:08:27.110" style="s2">what your life should look like and what</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.009" end="00:08:30.439" style="s2">goods and you should be doing and what</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.110" end="00:08:32.779" style="s2">your your profession should be you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.439" end="00:08:35.269" style="s2">not able to tap into your flow in your</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.779" end="00:08:37.190" style="s2">genius and do what you&#39;re here to do</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.269" end="00:08:39.949" style="s2">when it&#39;s been implemented there has</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.190" end="00:08:44.660" style="s2">been mass murder and genocide and if</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.949" end="00:08:46.639" style="s2">that needs to be your tool to get people</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.660" end="00:08:51.380" style="s2">to fall in line it&#39;s clearly a bad tool</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.639" end="00:08:53.269" style="s2">and so finding the pieces that work the</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.380" end="00:08:53.930" style="s2">pieces we want to try and always owning</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.269" end="00:08:56.990" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.930" end="00:08:59.149" style="s2">we&#39;re going to put into place can go</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.990" end="00:09:01.070" style="s2">wrong and how do we fix it when it goes</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.149" end="00:09:03.140" style="s2">wrong how do we how do we think about it</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.070" end="00:09:04.430" style="s2">before it it before we implement</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.140" end="00:09:07.130" style="s2">something what could go wrong and how do</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.430" end="00:09:09.380" style="s2">we kind of negate for that and then at</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.130" end="00:09:11.300" style="s2">the same time always being open to yes</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.380" end="00:09:14.690" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s also one of the big</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.300" end="00:09:16.520" style="s2">problems of communism was that they</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.690" end="00:09:18.500" style="s2">would set quotas and there was</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.520" end="00:09:19.790" style="s2">incentives to lie there was incentives</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.500" end="00:09:21.440" style="s2">to fudge the data because you would be</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.790" end="00:09:23.330" style="s2">punished if you didn&#39;t and to look at</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.440" end="00:09:25.339" style="s2">incentives and say but what happens when</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.330" end="00:09:27.890" style="s2">this when someone meets it and when</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.339" end="00:09:31.610" style="s2">someone doesn&#39;t if we can allow people</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.890" end="00:09:34.430" style="s2">to be truly honest about what the data</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.610" end="00:09:38.660" style="s2">is that is I think the greatest way that</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.430" end="00:09:41.209" style="s2">we can help the commons to you know that</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.660" end="00:09:43.250" style="s2">it&#39;s not okay well we made 80 bushels of</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.209" end="00:09:44.660" style="s2">grain it&#39;s like did you actually grow 80</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.250" end="00:09:47.750" style="s2">bushels of grain and if you didn&#39;t why</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.660" end="00:09:51.860" style="s2">like was it a labor brought like was it</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.750" end="00:09:55.450" style="s2">a labor problem was it a actual like the</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.860" end="00:09:57.440" style="s2">soil didn&#39;t grow that much the the</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.450" end="00:09:59.270" style="s2">temperature whatever it happens to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.440" end="00:10:02.480" style="s2">that if the information is true and</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.270" end="00:10:04.970" style="s2">accurate we can get a better yield next</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.480" end="00:10:06.350" style="s2">time as opposed to just making somebody</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.970" end="00:10:07.940" style="s2">wrong and shipping them off to prison</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.350" end="00:10:11.540" style="s2">because they didn&#39;t happen to make a</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.940" end="00:10:14.060" style="s2">quota that isn&#39;t possibly even even able</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.540" end="00:10:17.510" style="s2">to be made so I think within the space</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.060" end="00:10:20.000" style="s2">of of game B what how I&#39;m playing game</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.510" end="00:10:22.640" style="s2">be how I want how I envision the world</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.000" end="00:10:26.209" style="s2">to towards this proto PIA that we never</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.640" end="00:10:27.980" style="s2">quite reach is that everyone has their</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.209" end="00:10:29.930" style="s2">own individual freedom</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.980" end="00:10:32.630" style="s2">no one&#39;s dictating what you get to do</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.930" end="00:10:33.920" style="s2">and we have these autonomous groups that</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.630" end="00:10:36.110" style="s2">work together and there&#39;s an efficiency</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.920" end="00:10:37.910" style="s2">in the global system that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.110" end="00:10:39.950" style="s2">infringe on those two things it only</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.910" end="00:10:41.720" style="s2">supports them it supports the the</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.950" end="00:10:43.700" style="s2">individual freedom and the group</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.720" end="00:10:46.610" style="s2">autonomy that we want to be part of and</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.700" end="00:10:48.890" style="s2">I will also end that here so we can have</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.610" end="00:10:51.010" style="s2">a open discussion I&#39;m meeting both of</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.890" end="00:10:53.690" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.010" end="00:10:55.520" style="s2">there you go we all shared within eleven</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.690" end="00:10:58.160" style="s2">minutes so we have up to the half an</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.520" end="00:10:59.870" style="s2">hour mark to have an open discussion if</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.160" end="00:11:07.520" style="s2">we would like to</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.870" end="00:11:11.270" style="s2">I love what you said about being able to</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.520" end="00:11:13.760" style="s2">be honest about you know like you said</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.270" end="00:11:17.029" style="s2">the quotas and not only that but um I</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.760" end="00:11:18.770" style="s2">was reading a little bit about it and I</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.029" end="00:11:22.220" style="s2">was reading and I have a friend actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.770" end="00:11:26.510" style="s2">that she is from Poland so not too long</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.220" end="00:11:29.540" style="s2">ago they they had a communist country</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.510" end="00:11:31.940" style="s2">and she was telling me how they used to</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.540" end="00:11:33.529" style="s2">go into the markets and you know know</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.940" end="00:11:34.790" style="s2">that they would be shortage of food so</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.529" end="00:11:38.029" style="s2">they would be trading in this black</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.790" end="00:11:42.110" style="s2">market because they didn&#39;t have enough</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.029" end="00:11:43.670" style="s2">light of a certain resource so it would</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.110" end="00:11:46.490" style="s2">create a black market which I actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.670" end="00:11:49.610" style="s2">read that it creates a black market</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.490" end="00:11:53.029" style="s2">which in turn then what it does it um</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.610" end="00:11:54.950" style="s2">people start losing the trust in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.029" end="00:11:57.529" style="s2">people that are planning this economy</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.950" end="00:11:58.520" style="s2">which in turn it&#39;s like a vicious cycle</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.529" end="00:12:03.020" style="s2">because then it will turn into</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.520" end="00:12:05.240" style="s2">capitalism again so is is if it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.020" end="00:12:07.040" style="s2">we&#39;re going in circles in a way you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.240" end="00:12:10.420" style="s2">if we were to go through blue cap you</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.040" end="00:12:14.060" style="s2">know come in Assam so I think in is</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.420" end="00:12:16.160" style="s2">integrity is is you know raising people</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.060" end="00:12:18.770" style="s2">to that level of accountability and</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.160" end="00:12:20.120" style="s2">integrity you know in order for</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.770" end="00:12:22.820" style="s2">something like this to be sustained</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.120" end="00:12:30.740" style="s2">because they were required like a very</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.820" end="00:12:32.360" style="s2">high standard level of integrity so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.740" end="00:12:34.910" style="s2">I&#39;d like it is there&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.360" end="00:12:36.800" style="s2">that reminds me one of the part of where</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.910" end="00:12:40.730" style="s2">my information comes from her might were</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.800" end="00:12:43.400" style="s2">my innocent form from my father spent</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.730" end="00:12:47.990" style="s2">some time in Poland and Russia and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.400" end="00:12:50.390" style="s2">China starting in the nineties as a</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.990" end="00:12:53.990" style="s2">consultant working in the United States</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.390" end="00:12:55.970" style="s2">as a businessman Poland originally said</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.990" end="00:12:59.330" style="s2">hey we&#39;re looking at turning it into an</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.970" end="00:13:01.100" style="s2">economy how do we how do we do that what</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.330" end="00:13:02.690" style="s2">would be the considerations how do you</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.100" end="00:13:05.240" style="s2">know we don&#39;t have any idea we&#39;ve not</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.690" end="00:13:08.060" style="s2">been trained in that and so his his</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.240" end="00:13:10.970" style="s2">exposure was people who wanted to become</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.060" end="00:13:12.900" style="s2">more capitalist to really understand how</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.970" end="00:13:17.820" style="s2">to invest capital to grow</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.900" end="00:13:19.950" style="s2">and the mindset shift between what they</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.820" end="00:13:24.029" style="s2">thought and what they need no it was</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.950" end="00:13:25.740" style="s2">just so the perception so my father&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.029" end="00:13:27.180" style="s2">opinion before he went was basically</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.740" end="00:13:29.970" style="s2">coming as in the capsules is the same</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.180" end="00:13:31.950" style="s2">people are the same it&#39;s a very simple</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.970" end="00:13:33.839" style="s2">thing between them when he got over</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.950" end="00:13:36.390" style="s2">there like other the mines it&#39;s such a</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.839" end="00:13:39.000" style="s2">different mindset it&#39;s difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.390" end="00:13:40.680" style="s2">actually understand the two worlds</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.000" end="00:13:42.089" style="s2">from one perspective I don&#39;t think any</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.680" end="00:13:44.339" style="s2">but you know it really changed his mind</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.089" end="00:13:49.230" style="s2">not from the perspective of saying that</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.339" end="00:13:50.820" style="s2">communism was bad but it was just like</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.230" end="00:13:53.339" style="s2">it was so different I don&#39;t think we</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.820" end="00:13:56.690" style="s2">give it a full consideration of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.339" end="00:14:00.420" style="s2">there but but I also think that that</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.690" end="00:14:03.240" style="s2">this notion of how do we get to the best</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.420" end="00:14:05.220" style="s2">version of ourselves there&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.240" end="00:14:07.740" style="s2">part of this that I think is a really</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.220" end="00:14:10.710" style="s2">challenging part I think that we&#39;re born</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.740" end="00:14:13.500" style="s2">effectively in a larval stage of</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.710" end="00:14:15.900" style="s2">humanity I think that human beings have</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.500" end="00:14:18.839" style="s2">to grow up to a certain point before we</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.900" end="00:14:20.839" style="s2">can really fully give the varsity&#39;s so a</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.839" end="00:14:23.640" style="s2">lot of what you are saying Jubilee about</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.839" end="00:14:25.320" style="s2">how do we not be how do we not be</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.640" end="00:14:27.180" style="s2">selfish how do we how do we make sure</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.320" end="00:14:28.380" style="s2">that we get what we need in order to</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.180" end="00:14:32.130" style="s2">grow fully in order to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.380" end="00:14:33.450" style="s2">contribute fully what I would say is I</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.130" end="00:14:36.330" style="s2">think that there are two part of that</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.450" end="00:14:39.150" style="s2">one is that a basic minimum for the</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.330" end="00:14:41.390" style="s2">essential needs and then the other part</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.150" end="00:14:44.760" style="s2">is how do we have a feedback mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.390" end="00:14:47.480" style="s2">that says how well or what is how what</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.760" end="00:14:49.770" style="s2">impact are your actions having on</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.480" end="00:14:51.510" style="s2">yourself and the people around you and</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.770" end="00:14:53.610" style="s2">one of the things that I think is</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.510" end="00:14:55.589" style="s2">interesting at this moment in time is</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.610" end="00:14:58.470" style="s2">things like with blockchain in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.589" end="00:15:02.160" style="s2">internet and and artificial intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.470" end="00:15:05.400" style="s2">and different ways that we can not only</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.160" end="00:15:07.589" style="s2">monitor and see but analyze and share</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.400" end="00:15:09.450" style="s2">and perspectives on the feedback loops</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.589" end="00:15:11.190" style="s2">that we have are very different than</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.450" end="00:15:13.170" style="s2">it&#39;s ever been in the past so I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.190" end="00:15:15.990" style="s2">there&#39;s an incredible opportunity to do</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.170" end="00:15:18.300" style="s2">things as well as all sorts of ways in</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.990" end="00:15:20.459" style="s2">which this can go badly as well so I</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.300" end="00:15:23.850" style="s2">think the kinds of considerations for</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.459" end="00:15:26.259" style="s2">either capitalism or communism are so</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.850" end="00:15:29.049" style="s2">different that it really takes</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.259" end="00:15:31.569" style="s2">a fresh start of how do we I mean what</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.049" end="00:15:33.489" style="s2">what do we want to accomplish how do we</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.569" end="00:15:39.369" style="s2">take these feedback and mechanisms into</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.489" end="00:15:42.970" style="s2">account so I&#39;ll pause there yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.369" end="00:15:45.399" style="s2">that&#39;s um accurate I think that we live</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.970" end="00:15:48.579" style="s2">in a time period due to technology and</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.399" end="00:15:50.470" style="s2">our globalization that we&#39;ve never been</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.579" end="00:15:53.289" style="s2">able to implement a system that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.470" end="00:15:54.850" style="s2">now capable of implementing we really I</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.289" end="00:15:57.549" style="s2">think as a species we really suck at</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.850" end="00:16:00.069" style="s2">central planning because we never have</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.549" end="00:16:01.869" style="s2">perfect knowledge even if you have every</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.069" end="00:16:03.369" style="s2">piece of knowledge that the three of us</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.869" end="00:16:05.739" style="s2">have there&#39;s going to be a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.369" end="00:16:08.439" style="s2">information we don&#39;t have and so you</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.739" end="00:16:09.279" style="s2">plan based on your best information and</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.439" end="00:16:11.919" style="s2">if you&#39;re not happy if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.279" end="00:16:14.319" style="s2">allowing feedback into the system you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.919" end="00:16:15.759" style="s2">missing out and that&#39;s where the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.319" end="00:16:17.169" style="s2">incentives right if you&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.759" end="00:16:19.839" style="s2">punished for not having perfect</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.169" end="00:16:21.069" style="s2">information you&#39;re gonna pretend you</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.839" end="00:16:22.509" style="s2">have perfect information you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.069" end="00:16:24.699" style="s2">you know you&#39;re gonna you&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.509" end="00:16:28.299" style="s2">blind spots to to what isn&#39;t isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.699" end="00:16:30.309" style="s2">happening if everyone can say what isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.299" end="00:16:32.259" style="s2">working what they think won&#39;t work what</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.309" end="00:16:35.019" style="s2">they what they can see is not working</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.259" end="00:16:37.079" style="s2">for them as an individual and have a say</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.019" end="00:16:39.609" style="s2">and how to improve it for themselves</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.079" end="00:16:43.389" style="s2">with groups that also have those same</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.609" end="00:16:45.369" style="s2">issues I think there&#39;s a lot of power we</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.389" end="00:16:48.039" style="s2">can have as individuals and as small</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.369" end="00:16:50.799" style="s2">groups that is what I am working on</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.039" end="00:16:53.019" style="s2">creating in the world is the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.799" end="00:16:59.199" style="s2">to do that with technology that we all</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.019" end="00:17:00.699" style="s2">own together in a cooperative so can I</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.199" end="00:17:03.519" style="s2">can I say something</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.699" end="00:17:06.939" style="s2">just support that is also the stigma</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.519" end="00:17:09.459" style="s2">that communism has in the whole world as</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.939" end="00:17:12.730" style="s2">well and I that&#39;s why I hate labels</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.459" end="00:17:14.649" style="s2">because if there was something else that</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.730" end="00:17:17.260" style="s2">we can cut you call it you know a</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.649" end="00:17:19.419" style="s2">different type of system because I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.260" end="00:17:21.159" style="s2">within the stigma itself it would create</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.419" end="00:17:24.809" style="s2">a lot of problems with people that are</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.159" end="00:17:27.730" style="s2">not fully grasping what it would mean or</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.809" end="00:17:30.820" style="s2">the the different you know how it would</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.730" end="00:17:34.570" style="s2">be different that how it would be</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.820" end="00:17:38.880" style="s2">different then it was in the past or in</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.570" end="00:17:41.340" style="s2">history and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.880" end="00:17:43.080" style="s2">it will create the opposite of what we</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.340" end="00:17:45.889" style="s2">will be trying to create utopia because</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.080" end="00:17:48.570" style="s2">then you have sections of group 1 group</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.889" end="00:17:50.580" style="s2">understanding what is trying to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.570" end="00:17:52.139" style="s2">implemented and then the other group not</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.580" end="00:17:54.600" style="s2">really understanding and then going by</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.139" end="00:17:59.250" style="s2">the stigma of what communism our system</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.600" end="00:18:03.899" style="s2">yes so if it&#39;s possible and not possible</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.250" end="00:18:07.980" style="s2">I think it&#39;s maybe I&#39;m wrong but I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.899" end="00:18:12.029" style="s2">that maybe creating a new system that</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.980" end="00:18:14.190" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be label communists or mrsa</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.029" end="00:18:16.980" style="s2">cyst or any of that it&#39;s just a new</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.190" end="00:18:19.740" style="s2">system that is implementing implementing</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.980" end="00:18:22.169" style="s2">concepts that work that work for</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.740" end="00:18:29.750" style="s2">everyone you know it&#39;s just a little</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.169" end="00:18:31.980" style="s2">thought pause so I like that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.750" end="00:18:36.000" style="s2">there&#39;s a nuance here that I said I</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.980" end="00:18:38.970" style="s2">really want to think about because in a</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.000" end="00:18:41.269" style="s2">way we&#39;re critiquing Marxism and</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.970" end="00:18:43.919" style="s2">communism from the historical impact and</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.269" end="00:18:45.929" style="s2">and the people who are proponents of</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.919" end="00:18:48.230" style="s2">Marx say well Marx that&#39;s totally be</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.929" end="00:18:50.429" style="s2">given a chance it&#39;s not it&#39;s not pure</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.230" end="00:18:53.460" style="s2">but you could say the same thing is true</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.429" end="00:18:56.129" style="s2">for capitalism capitalism isn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.460" end="00:18:57.720" style="s2">given a full chance and in a way neither</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.129" end="00:18:59.909" style="s2">of those in their pew forum probably</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.720" end="00:19:05.549" style="s2">works the thought that comes to mind for</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.909" end="00:19:07.590" style="s2">me is I&#39;m pretty I have a bias that this</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.549" end="00:19:11.129" style="s2">is fact but I have a pretty fun bias</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.590" end="00:19:12.360" style="s2">that heavy feedback loop or systems of</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.129" end="00:19:15.029" style="s2">feedback loops are going to be very</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.360" end="00:19:16.230" style="s2">essential for whatever works we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.029" end="00:19:18.210" style="s2">actually have to be able to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.230" end="00:19:23.159" style="s2">transparent about what is the actual</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.210" end="00:19:25.799" style="s2">impact that works for everyone who was</p>

<p begin="00:19:25.799" end="00:19:29.070" style="s2">they outliers</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.460" end="00:19:31.710" style="s2">how many of those are there had how far</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.070" end="00:19:33.299" style="s2">outside of outliers out there you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.710" end="00:19:35.429" style="s2">or do they have an opportunity to come</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.299" end="00:19:37.830" style="s2">back in we&#39;re really being honest about</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.429" end="00:19:40.230" style="s2">what the impact is and what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.830" end="00:19:41.759" style="s2">in that one of the things that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.230" end="00:19:44.370" style="s2">seeing more of and this is something</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.759" end="00:19:49.289" style="s2">that I became very very clear to me is</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.370" end="00:19:51.230" style="s2">that and the and the current rhetoric</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.289" end="00:19:54.040" style="s2">around what</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.230" end="00:19:57.050" style="s2">an income disparity or wealth</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.040" end="00:19:59.600" style="s2">distribution it&#39;s getting worse and</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.050" end="00:20:01.490" style="s2">worse right and in some sense there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.600" end="00:20:03.680" style="s2">view that oh well this is just this is</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.490" end="00:20:06.110" style="s2">just greed there&#39;s another view that</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.680" end="00:20:07.220" style="s2">it&#39;s it actually is a free-market</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.110" end="00:20:11.000" style="s2">economy</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.220" end="00:20:15.620" style="s2">makes the rich richer it is inherently</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.000" end="00:20:19.430" style="s2">not only designed that way but it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.620" end="00:20:22.010" style="s2">a it&#39;s energetically works that way and</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.430" end="00:20:25.220" style="s2">so if you don&#39;t have checks and bounces</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.010" end="00:20:27.080" style="s2">or some way to to cause the flow to get</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.220" end="00:20:29.780" style="s2">the other direction it will go towards</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.080" end="00:20:32.630" style="s2">that towards wealth inequality the rich</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.780" end="00:20:34.910" style="s2">will continue to get richer so there has</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.630" end="00:20:36.680" style="s2">to be a mechanism for for doing</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.910" end="00:20:39.830" style="s2">something in the other direction well</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.680" end="00:20:41.930" style="s2">I&#39;m really curious about things like</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.830" end="00:20:44.870" style="s2">what Bernie Sanders wants it how do we</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.930" end="00:20:51.140" style="s2">inject capital or inject resources back</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.870" end="00:20:52.880" style="s2">down to the roots to the individuals out</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.140" end="00:20:57.830" style="s2">there so that they had a capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.880" end="00:21:00.140" style="s2">continue to grow up and I else a little</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.830" end="00:21:04.100" style="s2">bit the idea that debt Jubilee or the</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.140" end="00:21:05.660" style="s2">idea of really doing something to make</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.100" end="00:21:07.460" style="s2">sure that people real &#39;evil the ground</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.660" end="00:21:10.970" style="s2">the plain ground that under this</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.460" end="00:21:13.820" style="s2">mechanism it is clear that people have</p>

<p begin="00:21:22.220" end="00:21:26.000" style="s2">all of this is because we&#39;re all working</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.200" end="00:21:28.160" style="s2">together so this needs to be a way to</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.000" end="00:21:29.950" style="s2">make sure that we redouble the playing</p>

<p begin="00:21:36.760" end="00:21:41.330" style="s2">think that is very important um the idea</p>

<p begin="00:21:44.870" end="00:21:48.500" style="s2">of my whole life and why that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.430" end="00:21:49.790" style="s2">name it was from the Bible it&#39;s a time</p>

<p begin="00:21:55.340" end="00:22:00.710" style="s2">is and at the same time a lot of what a</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.650" end="00:22:02.630" style="s2">debt Jubilee does is prop up the middle</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.710" end="00:22:03.080" style="s2">class not the lower call a because if if</p>

<p begin="00:22:08.720" end="00:22:13.159" style="s2">something like what Remzi with common</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.490" end="00:22:15.200" style="s2">planet suggests which is giving people</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.159" end="00:22:17.480" style="s2">money right like having a universal</p>

<p begin="00:22:21.799" end="00:22:26.029" style="s2">some currency or unit of exchange I</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.409" end="00:22:28.159" style="s2">think that is that is powerful and</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.029" end="00:22:30.260" style="s2">needed because that undoes a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.159" end="00:22:32.240" style="s2">wrongs of the past unlike I think just a</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.260" end="00:22:34.190" style="s2">deeply I&#39;m like oh wait I don&#39;t look I</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.240" end="00:22:35.690" style="s2">don&#39;t own my house do I get to live in</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.190" end="00:22:38.480" style="s2">my house and keep it but someone with a</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.690" end="00:22:40.279" style="s2">mortgage in Vancouver does like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.480" end="00:22:42.769" style="s2">a lot of still inequalities that we</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.279" end="00:22:44.809" style="s2">still need to look at but I still would</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.769" end="00:22:46.519" style="s2">be ok with that over what we currently</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.809" end="00:22:48.799" style="s2">have which is basically how I feel about</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.519" end="00:22:50.210" style="s2">all game be stuff it&#39;s like I would sign</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.799" end="00:22:59.210" style="s2">up for it even if I see that there are</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.210" end="00:23:01.460" style="s2">some some issues with it it&#39;s funny I</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.210" end="00:23:03.139" style="s2">think that um it&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.460" end="00:23:05.210" style="s2">recognize that the comforter could be of</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.139" end="00:23:06.919" style="s2">that you know whatever it&#39;s implement it</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.210" end="00:23:15.919" style="s2">is going to be a challenge</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.919" end="00:23:19.850" style="s2">and certainly warps any past sense of</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.919" end="00:23:24.950" style="s2">debt right with education and housing</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.850" end="00:23:29.720" style="s2">and and and corporate debt it is the</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.950" end="00:23:33.110" style="s2">sense I mean in a way the problem right</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.720" end="00:23:35.000" style="s2">now is that actually I think the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.110" end="00:23:39.260" style="s2">aspect of why I see something going</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.000" end="00:23:41.450" style="s2">towards game B is the degree to which we</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.260" end="00:23:43.340" style="s2">externalise costs and don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.450" end="00:23:46.220" style="s2">account for them is the extent to which</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.340" end="00:23:50.570" style="s2">the economy is an abstraction where the</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.220" end="00:23:55.549" style="s2">what what we think of as as that part of</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.570" end="00:23:57.559" style="s2">the economy doesn&#39;t really as much as it</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.549" end="00:24:01.630" style="s2">needs to what the actual constraints are</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.559" end="00:24:04.250" style="s2">in the world we&#39;re able to ignore those</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.630" end="00:24:05.690" style="s2">so there&#39;s this there&#39;s a macro level</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.250" end="00:24:07.750" style="s2">effect and then there&#39;s the micro level</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.690" end="00:24:11.090" style="s2">effect what happens each one of us I</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.750" end="00:24:13.570" style="s2">think there&#39;s a lot of complexity there</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.090" end="00:24:15.590" style="s2">but I think the main thing is again it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.570" end="00:24:16.610" style="s2">how do we deal with this in a feedback</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.590" end="00:24:18.769" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.610" end="00:24:21.019" style="s2">it allows us to see really where are we</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.769" end="00:24:26.330" style="s2">what&#39;s happening and I think that it has</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.019" end="00:24:28.399" style="s2">to happen on a a very micro time scale</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.330" end="00:24:31.419" style="s2">as well like what are the decisions that</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.399" end="00:24:34.820" style="s2">you&#39;re making over the time and are you</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.419" end="00:24:36.289" style="s2">or you know it&#39;s for instance if we do</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.820" end="00:24:38.659" style="s2">something like a universal basic income</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.289" end="00:24:40.159" style="s2">what&#39;s the impact of that as well if I</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.659" end="00:24:43.340" style="s2">give you fifteen hundred also a month or</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.159" end="00:24:46.010" style="s2">whatever and a year are you eating</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.340" end="00:24:47.419" style="s2">healthy living healthy or are you just</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.010" end="00:24:49.700" style="s2">playing video games all day I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.419" end="00:24:52.010" style="s2">kind of like not so much from a judge of</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.700" end="00:24:54.260" style="s2">did that work but are you able to</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.010" end="00:24:57.110" style="s2">actually engage in that and that in a</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.260" end="00:24:59.350" style="s2">way that is promoting health or are you</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.110" end="00:25:04.340" style="s2">are you degrading your your</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.350" end="00:25:06.019" style="s2">circumstances also as this is referring</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.340" end="00:25:08.330" style="s2">back to our last conversation David on</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.019" end="00:25:09.649" style="s2">Monday is this hedonism that you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.330" end="00:25:10.820" style="s2">need to go through I mean I think a lot</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.649" end="00:25:12.350" style="s2">of what happens when you say they were</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.820" end="00:25:14.750" style="s2">gonna give people University basic</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.350" end="00:25:16.820" style="s2">universal basic income is people almost</p>

<p begin="00:25:16.820" end="00:25:19.639" style="s2">leg yeah I play video games all day</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.230" end="00:25:21.889" style="s2">every day and watch television for two</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.639" end="00:25:24.830" style="s2">years and then it got really boring and</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.889" end="00:25:27.710" style="s2">I figured out what I wanted to do and</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.830" end="00:25:30.620" style="s2">who move forward in that and to let</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.710" end="00:25:33.380" style="s2">people be in that space and so as an</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.620" end="00:25:35.029" style="s2">individual you gauge whether or not you</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.380" end="00:25:36.440" style="s2">feel like you&#39;re being fulfilled playing</p>

<p begin="00:25:53.960" end="00:25:57.760" style="s2">continually asking like what would help</p>

<p begin="00:25:57.760" end="00:26:03.019" style="s2">games all day what would stop you from</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.440" end="00:26:06.529" style="s2">playing video games and then helping you</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.019" end="00:26:07.820" style="s2">create that instead of just saying that</p>

<p begin="00:26:27.260" end="00:26:33.250" style="s2">about that I think that that that I</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.920" end="00:26:35.590" style="s2">understand where you&#39;re coming from and</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.250" end="00:26:37.540" style="s2">some people can get to that realization</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.590" end="00:26:39.550" style="s2">that playing video games all day it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.540" end="00:26:41.830" style="s2">not gonna work for them and they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.550" end="00:26:44.670" style="s2">feel fulfilled but then you also have to</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.830" end="00:26:48.070" style="s2">you know sink into consideration like</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.670" end="00:26:51.360" style="s2">addictions and mental illness and other</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.070" end="00:26:54.760" style="s2">things that would contribute to someone</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.360" end="00:26:56.530" style="s2">playing video games or using drugs or</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.760" end="00:26:59.440" style="s2">doing anything that could be addictive</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.530" end="00:27:01.180" style="s2">that fulfillment who would not play a</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.440" end="00:27:06.130" style="s2">part of it because it&#39;s all in the mind</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.180" end="00:27:09.460" style="s2">and so like I don&#39;t know how how would</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.130" end="00:27:12.790" style="s2">that work in that in that sense as</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.460" end="00:27:16.480" style="s2">someone who has addictions addictions or</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.790" end="00:27:19.000" style="s2">you know mental illness and trauma and</p>

<p begin="00:27:21.010" end="00:27:27.700" style="s2">games and with there&#39;s only so much I</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.030" end="00:27:30.040" style="s2">could handle before I had to go inside</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.700" end="00:27:34.720" style="s2">and be like this feels gross I&#39;m still</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.040" end="00:27:36.610" style="s2">in a very toxic world right and so in a</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.720" end="00:27:40.090" style="s2">world that that&#39;s hurting me because of</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.610" end="00:27:41.440" style="s2">the what I call capitalism like the fact</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.090" end="00:27:43.150" style="s2">that there is so many people with</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.440" end="00:27:45.340" style="s2">addiction so much inequality so much</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.150" end="00:27:46.870" style="s2">suffering around me I was trying to numb</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.340" end="00:27:48.730" style="s2">out I could deal with my own stuff as</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.870" end="00:27:51.040" style="s2">much as I could but I couldn&#39;t deal with</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.730" end="00:27:52.600" style="s2">the rest until I figured out what I</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.040" end="00:27:54.370" style="s2">think is a solution and now I&#39;m moving</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.600" end="00:27:57.370" style="s2">towards that I found a purpose and that</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.370" end="00:27:59.050" style="s2">although I still have my addictions it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.370" end="00:28:01.570" style="s2">pulling me out of it while unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.050" end="00:28:03.310" style="s2">with it it has to be my choice and it</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.570" end="00:28:05.830" style="s2">has to be like where am i meeting myself</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.310" end="00:28:08.200" style="s2">right what makes me feel good if I spend</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.830" end="00:28:11.110" style="s2">all day watching watching TV in video</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.200" end="00:28:12.820" style="s2">games that&#39;s okay but not what I do it</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.110" end="00:28:16.300" style="s2">for months on end or weeks on end I</p>

<p begin="00:28:21.160" end="00:28:25.090" style="s2">because they had nothing and they put</p>

<p begin="00:29:24.759" end="00:29:28.779" style="s2">being with other rats right like being</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.309" end="00:29:31.720" style="s2">with other people in a way that actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.779" end="00:29:33.370" style="s2">works that isn&#39;t society&#39;s version of</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.720" end="00:29:34.870" style="s2">like they&#39;d go out to a coffee shop I</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.370" end="00:29:37.120" style="s2">mean out to a coffee shop is torture for</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.870" end="00:29:38.740" style="s2">me it&#39;s too loud too chaotic but sitting</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.120" end="00:29:40.750" style="s2">with someone and having a real</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.740" end="00:29:43.269" style="s2">conversation is amazing so that&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.750" end="00:29:48.700" style="s2">that online within my capacity that I</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.269" end="00:29:49.929" style="s2">can I can do so so there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.700" end="00:29:53.049" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing really interesting in</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.929" end="00:29:54.460" style="s2">the end I want to first to note that if</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.049" end="00:29:56.440" style="s2">anybody&#39;s watching this because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.460" end="00:29:59.700" style="s2">interested in argument on Marxism become</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.440" end="00:30:01.570" style="s2">communist this is not going to satisfy</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.700" end="00:30:02.860" style="s2">really looking at a different a</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.570" end="00:30:04.659" style="s2">different thing but I think it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.860" end="00:30:08.649" style="s2">important aspect and what you just said</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.659" end="00:30:12.789" style="s2">about I also look at the one of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.649" end="00:30:15.309" style="s2">conclusions from rats in a cage whether</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.789" end="00:30:18.220" style="s2">they whether they see their addiction or</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.309" end="00:30:20.799" style="s2">whether they live healthily right - so</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.220" end="00:30:23.830" style="s2">in some extent if I if I play this out</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.799" end="00:30:27.309" style="s2">and in my mind if I ask the rest in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.830" end="00:30:31.000" style="s2">cage what it wants it&#39;s clear it wants</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.309" end="00:30:34.690" style="s2">heroin cocaine right it wants to wants</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.000" end="00:30:36.940" style="s2">to just to make the pain go away if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.690" end="00:30:39.210" style="s2">living in heaven what it wants us to</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.940" end="00:30:43.539" style="s2">continue to do that it doesn&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.210" end="00:30:47.860" style="s2">something that helps it cope with the</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.539" end="00:30:50.260" style="s2">pain but and and and and it will do that</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.860" end="00:30:53.880" style="s2">what we&#39;ve seen is it&#39;ll do that until</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.260" end="00:30:55.890" style="s2">death or until it hits rock bottom and</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.880" end="00:30:58.320" style="s2">simply has an insight for people who</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.890" end="00:30:59.400" style="s2">deal with addiction clear that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.320" end="00:31:01.770" style="s2">number of people who deal with</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.400" end="00:31:04.260" style="s2">addictions mean that a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.770" end="00:31:06.240" style="s2">feel like they&#39;re living in a cage and</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.260" end="00:31:08.340" style="s2">if we ask people what they want when</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.240" end="00:31:11.340" style="s2">they&#39;re living in a cage its relief and</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.340" end="00:31:12.450" style="s2">that is I just say go take care of this</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.340" end="00:31:15.210" style="s2">on your own</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.450" end="00:31:18.150" style="s2">the tendency to go to addictive behavior</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.210" end="00:31:20.430" style="s2">until it&#39;s clear this addictive behavior</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.150" end="00:31:23.460" style="s2">is never going to get me out of this</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.430" end="00:31:26.190" style="s2">loop I&#39;m only going to keep making the</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.460" end="00:31:28.260" style="s2">cage it&#39;s gonna make the cage persist</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.190" end="00:31:30.570" style="s2">and I&#39;m not gonna be able to get out of</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.260" end="00:31:33.060" style="s2">the cage the only way out of this cage</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.570" end="00:31:36.480" style="s2">is to really back up and say okay I need</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.060" end="00:31:39.000" style="s2">to do mine but that&#39;s a that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.480" end="00:31:40.470" style="s2">interesting shift you know I think that</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.000" end="00:31:43.170" style="s2">you almost this is part of what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.470" end="00:31:45.180" style="s2">by the feedback loop we need to be able</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.170" end="00:31:48.150" style="s2">to use rationality you know and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.180" end="00:31:51.030" style="s2">using Vegas concept of that of a</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.150" end="00:31:53.460" style="s2">feedback loop intelligence to say okay</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.030" end="00:31:55.530" style="s2">at the beginning of the week if I just</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.460" end="00:31:57.870" style="s2">do what I want by the end of the week I</p>
