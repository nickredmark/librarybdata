<p begin="00:00:01.439" end="00:00:03.520" style="s2">all right welcome to the solution</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.879" end="00:00:06.080" style="s2">raising</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.520" end="00:00:08.160" style="s2">on climate change i put out a call for</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.080" end="00:00:09.599" style="s2">what topics were too big to tackle with</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.160" end="00:00:12.080" style="s2">the solution raising</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.599" end="00:00:14.240" style="s2">and a few people had mentioned this one</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.080" end="00:00:14.639" style="s2">so i am excited to tackle it because i</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.240" end="00:00:16.480" style="s2">don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.639" end="00:00:18.000" style="s2">i spoiler alert i don&#39;t think anything&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.480" end="00:00:20.000" style="s2">too big for us to tackle the solution</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.000" end="00:00:22.960" style="s2">crazy and i think there&#39;s always a way</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.000" end="00:00:24.240" style="s2">to take an improvement forward so</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.960" end="00:00:26.400" style="s2">solution raising is</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.240" end="00:00:27.760" style="s2">a conversation in three parts we first</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.400" end="00:00:28.640" style="s2">talk about what the world currently</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.760" end="00:00:30.720" style="s2">looks like</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.640" end="00:00:32.000" style="s2">we vent maybe even offer some some</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.720" end="00:00:32.960" style="s2">things that are great that are happening</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.000" end="00:00:34.960" style="s2">in that space</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.960" end="00:00:36.399" style="s2">and then we switch over into our utopian</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.960" end="00:00:37.280" style="s2">visions of the future what would it look</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.399" end="00:00:39.600" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.280" end="00:00:41.040" style="s2">when everything solved in that area in</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.600" end="00:00:42.399" style="s2">this case climate change we no longer</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.040" end="00:00:44.160" style="s2">have to worry about it we tell our</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.399" end="00:00:45.600" style="s2">grandkids we solved it and</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.160" end="00:00:47.280" style="s2">they don&#39;t need to match one another&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.600" end="00:00:49.680" style="s2">so if someone else contradicts yours</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.280" end="00:00:51.039" style="s2">it&#39;s perfectly fine because</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.680" end="00:00:53.680" style="s2">spoiler alert we can actually create</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.039" end="00:00:55.440" style="s2">utopias so then we move on to the</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.680" end="00:00:56.640" style="s2">adjacent possible what we could actually</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.440" end="00:00:58.800" style="s2">create together</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.640" end="00:00:59.680" style="s2">that we would like to be part of that</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.800" end="00:01:01.840" style="s2">involve</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.680" end="00:01:03.760" style="s2">that only requires ten thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.840" end="00:01:05.840" style="s2">and a hundred thousand dollars</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.760" end="00:01:07.600" style="s2">and uh i was rewatching one of the old</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.840" end="00:01:08.880" style="s2">solution raisings and i started the</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.600" end="00:01:11.360" style="s2">first one</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.880" end="00:01:12.159" style="s2">explaining that um the idea is to let</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.360" end="00:01:14.080" style="s2">the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.159" end="00:01:15.840" style="s2">emerge so though we do want to allow for</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.080" end="00:01:17.520" style="s2">everyone to to talk we don&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.840" end="00:01:18.080" style="s2">need everyone to talk in every segment</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.520" end="00:01:20.320" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.080" end="00:01:21.840" style="s2">you&#39;re encouraged to uh you know keep</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.320" end="00:01:27.520" style="s2">your your thoughts precise</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.840" end="00:01:27.520" style="s2">if you can i know i can&#39;t and and allow</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.080" end="00:01:31.360" style="s2">it&#39;s like there&#39;s a sixth person here</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.520" end="00:01:32.560" style="s2">which is the conversation right allowing</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.360" end="00:01:35.040" style="s2">that to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.560" end="00:01:35.600" style="s2">elaborate so who would like to start</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.040" end="00:01:37.600" style="s2">sharing</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.600" end="00:01:39.200" style="s2">with how they see solution raising i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.600" end="00:01:41.840" style="s2">sorry climate change</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.200" end="00:01:41.840" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.280" end="00:01:47.280" style="s2">well i&#39;ll kick off i mean i don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.280" end="00:01:48.799" style="s2">the word i don&#39;t like the term i think</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.280" end="00:01:51.920" style="s2">it&#39;s i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.799" end="00:01:53.280" style="s2">um misleading in a couple of ways i mean</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.920" end="00:01:55.200" style="s2">firstly the climate is in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.280" end="00:01:57.119" style="s2">constant state of change right and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.200" end="00:01:59.680" style="s2">yeah climate change so what right</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.119" end="00:02:01.040" style="s2">so it&#39;s change other than change that it</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.680" end="00:02:02.880" style="s2">was supposed to be doing anyway</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.040" end="00:02:04.159" style="s2">something like that right so i i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.880" end="00:02:05.439" style="s2">like the word on that level</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.159" end="00:02:07.360" style="s2">the other thing i really don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.439" end="00:02:10.560" style="s2">about it is that it</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.360" end="00:02:12.319" style="s2">has a tendency to focus the effort the</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.560" end="00:02:14.959" style="s2">conversation the research the</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.319" end="00:02:15.840" style="s2">media coverage etc entirely on carbon</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.959" end="00:02:18.640" style="s2">dioxide</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.840" end="00:02:20.160" style="s2">i much much much prefer the in term</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.640" end="00:02:21.680" style="s2">environmental degradation or</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.160" end="00:02:22.000" style="s2">environmental destruction or something</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.680" end="00:02:24.400" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.000" end="00:02:26.319" style="s2">that so that we can you know in the same</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.400" end="00:02:29.760" style="s2">conversation talk about plastic</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.319" end="00:02:32.000" style="s2">and you know fertilizer runoff and</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.760" end="00:02:33.599" style="s2">soil erosion and deforestation and all</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.000" end="00:02:35.760" style="s2">of this kind of stuff right</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.599" end="00:02:37.120" style="s2">um because it sort of leaves all of that</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.760" end="00:02:38.879" style="s2">to the side right all of that can be</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.120" end="00:02:41.360" style="s2">ignored because the big thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.879" end="00:02:43.360" style="s2">is carbon dioxide so i&#39;ll just kick off</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.360" end="00:02:45.360" style="s2">by saying that</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.360" end="00:02:47.120" style="s2">i would just echo what eric said you</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.360" end="00:02:47.920" style="s2">know i made a couple little notes coming</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.120" end="00:02:50.160" style="s2">into here</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.920" end="00:02:51.599" style="s2">that was the main one is and i&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.160" end="00:02:54.000" style="s2">to other friends about this</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.599" end="00:02:54.800" style="s2">we need i think we need to be much more</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.000" end="00:02:58.720" style="s2">concerned</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.800" end="00:03:02.560" style="s2">about chemicals polluting</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.720" end="00:03:05.599" style="s2">water systems landfill problems</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.560" end="00:03:09.360" style="s2">more like chemical and general</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.599" end="00:03:12.640" style="s2">waste yeah the temperature</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.360" end="00:03:13.920" style="s2">i think will adapt and i don&#39;t think we</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.640" end="00:03:16.080" style="s2">need to ignore</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.920" end="00:03:17.519" style="s2">the earth&#39;s temperature i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.080" end="00:03:21.360" style="s2">it&#39;s our main concern</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.519" end="00:03:21.360" style="s2">and then other things on</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.680" end="00:03:28.159" style="s2">one other topic that i see as a problem</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.879" end="00:03:31.120" style="s2">is that it i don&#39;t think it&#39;s cool</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.159" end="00:03:31.120" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.200" end="00:03:36.400" style="s2">a person who is trying to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.640" end="00:03:39.680" style="s2">environmentally sound</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.400" end="00:03:42.239" style="s2">it&#39;s not cool and it&#39;s not sexy um</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.680" end="00:03:44.080" style="s2">to do as little impact on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.239" end="00:03:46.640" style="s2">environment as possible</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.080" end="00:03:48.000" style="s2">the only way to be cool and be sexy and</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.640" end="00:03:51.360" style="s2">get attention</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.000" end="00:03:54.640" style="s2">is to be a consumer and show off the</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.360" end="00:03:57.680" style="s2">stuff that you i have i</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.640" end="00:04:01.599" style="s2">i don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.680" end="00:04:06.000" style="s2">i mean even in even in finding a mate</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.599" end="00:04:08.319" style="s2">like it&#39;s not cool to kind of do</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.000" end="00:04:09.840" style="s2">nothing oh i&#39;m cool because i do no</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.319" end="00:04:12.640" style="s2">impact on</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.840" end="00:04:13.680" style="s2">the environment i think we need</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.640" end="00:04:16.720" style="s2">incentives</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.680" end="00:04:19.519" style="s2">for people to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.720" end="00:04:20.479" style="s2">low impact and i i don&#39;t see a world</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.519" end="00:04:23.759" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.479" end="00:04:28.560" style="s2">what are my incentives um</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.759" end="00:04:31.199" style="s2">it&#39;s be nice to change that somehow</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.560" end="00:04:32.560" style="s2">so i i definitely agree with the needing</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.199" end="00:04:35.040" style="s2">incentives for</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.560" end="00:04:36.800" style="s2">lower impact lifestyles i&#39;m gonna play</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.040" end="00:04:38.960" style="s2">devil&#39;s advocate a little bit on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.800" end="00:04:42.320" style="s2">temperature problem being</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.960" end="00:04:45.759" style="s2">a pressing problem and</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.320" end="00:04:49.199" style="s2">mainly because of the concerns about</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.759" end="00:04:52.479" style="s2">methane release in the arctic um</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.199" end="00:04:53.919" style="s2">and us entering a feedback loop that we</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.479" end="00:04:57.120" style="s2">can&#39;t control</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.919" end="00:05:00.400" style="s2">so one of the focus focuses on</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.120" end="00:05:01.600" style="s2">co2 reduction right now is uh to try to</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.400" end="00:05:04.160" style="s2">prevent</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.600" end="00:05:05.520" style="s2">uh melting of permafrost in the arctic</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.160" end="00:05:08.720" style="s2">and release of</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.520" end="00:05:11.440" style="s2">methane which has 27 times the</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.720" end="00:05:12.479" style="s2">impact in terms of greenhouse gas</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.440" end="00:05:15.520" style="s2">warming</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.479" end="00:05:18.160" style="s2">of co2 um so</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.520" end="00:05:19.759" style="s2">if we end up in that feedback loop we</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.160" end="00:05:21.919" style="s2">may not be able to stop it</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.759" end="00:05:23.520" style="s2">uh we may not be able to actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.919" end="00:05:26.639" style="s2">control the temperature</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.520" end="00:05:30.479" style="s2">and regulate the problem and we&#39;d see</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.639" end="00:05:34.000" style="s2">massive sea level rise we&#39;d see droughts</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.479" end="00:05:38.400" style="s2">uh large storms standard climate change</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.000" end="00:05:40.960" style="s2">impacts magnified significantly so</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.400" end="00:05:43.280" style="s2">i do think there is a place for having a</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.960" end="00:05:49.199" style="s2">discussion about co2</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.280" end="00:05:49.199" style="s2">and trying to control co2 emissions</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.520" end="00:05:55.199" style="s2">um i don&#39;t really think i have too much</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.360" end="00:05:55.840" style="s2">here to add that hasn&#39;t been said</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.199" end="00:05:57.919" style="s2">already</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.840" end="00:05:59.199" style="s2">um i&#39;m trying to dig in and see if</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.919" end="00:06:02.240" style="s2">there&#39;s anything that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.199" end="00:06:02.240" style="s2">pressing um</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.160" end="00:06:10.880" style="s2">i think my the</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.280" end="00:06:14.319" style="s2">the the need that i</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.880" end="00:06:17.360" style="s2">see is for a connected</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.319" end="00:06:18.000" style="s2">ecosystem of data that can be made sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.360" end="00:06:22.400" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.000" end="00:06:22.400" style="s2">to inform people</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.639" end="00:06:29.840" style="s2">well that the</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.400" end="00:06:30.400" style="s2">you know what to do um i i think that</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.840" end="00:06:32.720" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.400" end="00:06:34.080" style="s2">right now data&#39;s very disjointed there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.720" end="00:06:37.600" style="s2">just a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.080" end="00:06:41.840" style="s2">issues with reporting and and</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.600" end="00:06:45.840" style="s2">how everything gets done and so um</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.840" end="00:06:49.919" style="s2">to me it seems as if there needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.840" end="00:06:53.680" style="s2">better practices in</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.919" end="00:06:57.120" style="s2">making sense of what is going on</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.680" end="00:06:57.120" style="s2">in the world via</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.400" end="00:07:05.919" style="s2">you know technology um</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.840" end="00:07:07.360" style="s2">you know i could add an example to that</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.919" end="00:07:08.400" style="s2">i researched this but daniel i want to</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.360" end="00:07:10.400" style="s2">just share mine</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.400" end="00:07:11.520" style="s2">quickly uh just because i wanted to that</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.400" end="00:07:13.919" style="s2">this one uh then</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.520" end="00:07:15.520" style="s2">the topic was climate change and i did</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.919" end="00:07:17.199" style="s2">think about what eric said like i also</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.520" end="00:07:19.280" style="s2">i&#39;m like there&#39;s such a bigger thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.199" end="00:07:21.120" style="s2">by the environment and environmental</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.280" end="00:07:22.639" style="s2">degradation all the crap we put into the</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.120" end="00:07:24.080" style="s2">world not just co2</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.639" end="00:07:25.759" style="s2">and the stuff that affects climate</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.080" end="00:07:27.280" style="s2">climate and at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.759" end="00:07:28.960" style="s2">the fact that it&#39;s a positive feedback</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.280" end="00:07:30.720" style="s2">loop that like the more it rises the</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.960" end="00:07:33.759" style="s2">more it&#39;s going to rise</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.720" end="00:07:35.680" style="s2">um and we are a biological</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.759" end="00:07:37.599" style="s2">human humans are biological and we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.680" end="00:07:39.280" style="s2">really deal with extreme temperatures</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.599" end="00:07:41.440" style="s2">yet we&#39;re also really intelligent and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.280" end="00:07:44.879" style="s2">we can adapt to extreme temperatures</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.440" end="00:07:46.560" style="s2">and so there is we don&#39;t actually a</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.879" end="00:07:48.000" style="s2">hundred percent know if humans are the</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.560" end="00:07:49.759" style="s2">cause of climate change but we have to</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.000" end="00:07:51.840" style="s2">deal with it either way</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.759" end="00:07:53.680" style="s2">and so that was one of the reasons why i</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.840" end="00:07:55.039" style="s2">put climate change at the topic was</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.680" end="00:07:56.960" style="s2">but if it goes in the other direction</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.039" end="00:08:01.199" style="s2">i&#39;m fully okay with that but that</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.960" end="00:08:03.120" style="s2">how do we if we&#39;re responsible</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.199" end="00:08:04.400" style="s2">do something about it and if we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.120" end="00:08:05.840" style="s2">responsible</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.400" end="00:08:07.360" style="s2">figure it out anyway because we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.840" end="00:08:08.960" style="s2">to figure out how to deal with this as</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.360" end="00:08:10.000" style="s2">it comes and we&#39;re not going to be able</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.960" end="00:08:11.680" style="s2">to do that under gaming</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.000" end="00:08:13.840" style="s2">capitalism right like it&#39;s like well we</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.680" end="00:08:15.840" style="s2">just need to create a for-profit model</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.840" end="00:08:18.720" style="s2">to deal with the climate change</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.840" end="00:08:20.960" style="s2">changes and so that&#39;s what i want daniel</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.720" end="00:08:23.520" style="s2">if you wanted to add your</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.960" end="00:08:24.479" style="s2">uh just real quickly for example i</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.520" end="00:08:28.080" style="s2">always heard that</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.479" end="00:08:29.039" style="s2">um that cows are adding to climate</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.080" end="00:08:30.800" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.039" end="00:08:32.159" style="s2">um and it was something like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.800" end="00:08:35.519" style="s2">adding like</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.159" end="00:08:37.360" style="s2">20 to 30 percent of the co2 emissions</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.519" end="00:08:40.080" style="s2">and then i just recently heard that that</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.360" end="00:08:42.240" style="s2">was wrong that it&#39;s only two percent</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.080" end="00:08:44.320" style="s2">of the co2 emissions and it&#39;s not a big</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.240" end="00:08:46.160" style="s2">deal and just goes back to jared&#39;s thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.320" end="00:08:48.800" style="s2">on sense making</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.160" end="00:08:50.720" style="s2">i i don&#39;t know what to believe now and</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.800" end="00:08:52.560" style="s2">trying to understand</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.720" end="00:08:54.320" style="s2">someone skewing the data where&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.560" end="00:08:57.440" style="s2">coming from that</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.320" end="00:08:59.440" style="s2">is so frustrating</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.440" end="00:09:00.640" style="s2">yeah i mean i suspect it&#39;s some i mean i</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.440" end="00:09:02.240" style="s2">don&#39;t know because i haven&#39;t seen these</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.640" end="00:09:03.839" style="s2">data but i suspect it&#39;s something like</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.240" end="00:09:06.080" style="s2">the two percent is talking about just</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.839" end="00:09:07.839" style="s2">the cows right just the farting and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.080" end="00:09:09.839" style="s2">and the breathing of the cows whereas</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.839" end="00:09:11.200" style="s2">the 30 is talking about</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.839" end="00:09:12.720" style="s2">all the land that&#39;s cleared in order to</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.200" end="00:09:14.640" style="s2">make room for the cows and all the</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.720" end="00:09:16.000" style="s2">transportation of the grain to the cows</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.640" end="00:09:17.120" style="s2">and all of this kind of stuff is</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.000" end="00:09:19.040" style="s2">included in the 30</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.120" end="00:09:20.240" style="s2">words it&#39;s not included in the two</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.040" end="00:09:22.560" style="s2">percent you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.240" end="00:09:24.320" style="s2">so yeah no no no no but but it goes</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.560" end="00:09:26.160" style="s2">exactly to your point about</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.320" end="00:09:27.680" style="s2">confusion around the ability to make</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.160" end="00:09:29.440" style="s2">sense because if there&#39;s no clear</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.680" end="00:09:32.000" style="s2">understanding of what what these numbers</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.440" end="00:09:33.440" style="s2">actually are representing then it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.000" end="00:09:35.200" style="s2">very very easy for them to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.440" end="00:09:36.880" style="s2">misrepresentative you know exactly</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.200" end="00:09:38.399" style="s2">exactly as you just pointed out</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.880" end="00:09:40.080" style="s2">can i just pick up on something jared</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.399" end="00:09:43.519" style="s2">said as well about this</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.080" end="00:09:46.480" style="s2">this idea of a connected um</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.519" end="00:09:48.080" style="s2">approach to delivering information and</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.480" end="00:09:50.000" style="s2">being able to make choices because i</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.080" end="00:09:52.240" style="s2">think that connected approach to</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.000" end="00:09:54.000" style="s2">climate change is also really important</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.240" end="00:09:54.959" style="s2">i mean this this thing about singling</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.000" end="00:09:56.800" style="s2">out co2</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.959" end="00:09:58.160" style="s2">unfortunately what it means is that the</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.800" end="00:10:01.120" style="s2">whole um</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.160" end="00:10:03.360" style="s2">financial economic industrial apparatus</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.120" end="00:10:04.720" style="s2">orients itself around co2 reduction</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.360" end="00:10:07.279" style="s2">right at any cost</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.720" end="00:10:09.279" style="s2">right and the externalities involved in</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.279" end="00:10:10.720" style="s2">that are way worse than the co2 was in</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.279" end="00:10:13.040" style="s2">the first place you know so</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.720" end="00:10:14.800" style="s2">this is this is the issue about about</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.040" end="00:10:16.160" style="s2">focusing on co2 and so</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.800" end="00:10:17.680" style="s2">you know there&#39;s i can&#39;t remember who</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.160" end="00:10:18.000" style="s2">the guy was it&#39;s a really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.680" end="00:10:21.040" style="s2">video</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.000" end="00:10:23.040" style="s2">about soil that soil regeneration</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.040" end="00:10:24.720" style="s2">alone if we were to return to a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.040" end="00:10:28.079" style="s2">permaculture type</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.720" end="00:10:30.880" style="s2">attitude towards global agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.079" end="00:10:32.720" style="s2">that alone would solve the whole climate</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.880" end="00:10:34.560" style="s2">thing right because the regeneration of</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.720" end="00:10:37.440" style="s2">the soil microbiota</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.560" end="00:10:39.200" style="s2">would absorb all the co2 necessary out</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.440" end="00:10:40.720" style="s2">of the engine just like that right at</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.200" end="00:10:41.360" style="s2">while at the same time regenerating the</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.720" end="00:10:42.959" style="s2">soil so</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.360" end="00:10:44.480" style="s2">connecting these things together and</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.959" end="00:10:45.760" style="s2">understanding that soil erosion and</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.480" end="00:10:47.839" style="s2">deforestation</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.760" end="00:10:49.360" style="s2">massively impacts on not just because</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.839" end="00:10:51.120" style="s2">you&#39;ve taken down the trees which are</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.360" end="00:10:53.040" style="s2">turning carbon dioxide into oxygen but</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.120" end="00:10:54.800" style="s2">all of the other things that are</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.040" end="00:10:57.040" style="s2">connected to that right</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.800" end="00:10:58.560" style="s2">and and so there&#39;s focusing on one thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.040" end="00:10:59.519" style="s2">and saying that&#39;s the thing we have to</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.560" end="00:11:01.120" style="s2">deal with now</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.519" end="00:11:03.040" style="s2">and the externalities that we</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.120" end="00:11:04.959" style="s2">create in the meantime while doing so</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.040" end="00:11:06.320" style="s2">i&#39;m sorry but i&#39;ve got a really really</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.959" end="00:11:08.800" style="s2">big issue with that</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.320" end="00:11:10.560" style="s2">yeah no i i would i would definitely</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.800" end="00:11:13.760" style="s2">agree with you that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.560" end="00:11:16.640" style="s2">be able to focus on externalities</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.760" end="00:11:18.240" style="s2">because if you look at just efforts that</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.640" end="00:11:22.399" style="s2">have been done in the past</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.240" end="00:11:23.920" style="s2">uh say the the creation of biodiesel for</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.399" end="00:11:27.680" style="s2">the european market</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.920" end="00:11:31.040" style="s2">with jatropha farming and with uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.680" end="00:11:34.480" style="s2">creating palm plantations in indonesia</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.040" end="00:11:37.600" style="s2">um like the palm plantation creation</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.480" end="00:11:38.079" style="s2">led to so much deforestation that you</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.600" end="00:11:41.760" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.079" end="00:11:44.079" style="s2">had a lower co2</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.760" end="00:11:44.800" style="s2">sequestration in those forests uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.079" end="00:11:46.800" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.800" end="00:11:48.720" style="s2">and great co2 emissions because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.800" end="00:11:50.560" style="s2">burning the forest to create these</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.720" end="00:11:52.399" style="s2">palm plantations that people could drive</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.560" end="00:11:55.440" style="s2">their cars with the biodiesel</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.399" end="00:11:57.600" style="s2">in the european market so i mean i i</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.440" end="00:11:59.360" style="s2">think we definitely</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.600" end="00:12:02.160" style="s2">we definitely have to consider the these</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.360" end="00:12:03.040" style="s2">economic drivers and what the impacts</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.160" end="00:12:06.000" style="s2">will be</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.040" end="00:12:06.560" style="s2">um i do want to match on to your point</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.000" end="00:12:09.680" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.560" end="00:12:11.760" style="s2">uh soil and agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.680" end="00:12:13.680" style="s2">because i think there if this is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.760" end="00:12:16.079" style="s2">solution raising i think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.680" end="00:12:18.079" style="s2">actually a really interesting solution</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.079" end="00:12:20.399" style="s2">uh framework around that</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.079" end="00:12:22.839" style="s2">um like there&#39;s been a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.399" end="00:12:27.279" style="s2">interesting stuff on biochar</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.839" end="00:12:28.079" style="s2">um looking at how biochar could be used</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.279" end="00:12:30.560" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.079" end="00:12:31.279" style="s2">sequestration and agricultural processes</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.560" end="00:12:34.480" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.279" end="00:12:36.800" style="s2">help restore degraded soils</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.480" end="00:12:38.160" style="s2">um so that might be an area that we</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.800" end="00:12:42.800" style="s2">might want to</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.160" end="00:12:42.800" style="s2">look into in terms of solutions</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.240" end="00:12:46.639" style="s2">yeah especially if it&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.279" end="00:12:48.399" style="s2">happening if it&#39;s not something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.639" end="00:12:49.519" style="s2">like off in the distant future i don&#39;t i</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.399" end="00:12:51.040" style="s2">that&#39;s the first time i&#39;ve encountered</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.519" end="00:12:52.399" style="s2">that term so i don&#39;t know about it i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.040" end="00:12:54.959" style="s2">invite us to switch over</p>

<p begin="00:13:15.120" end="00:13:17.920" style="s2">have to be an integrated we can just</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.399" end="00:13:18.880" style="s2">concrete the whole thing over we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.920" end="00:13:21.760" style="s2">need plants and</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.880" end="00:13:23.519" style="s2">and oceans and trees and and we</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.760" end="00:13:25.920" style="s2">that just concrete the whole thing over</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.519" end="00:13:27.040" style="s2">process the atmosphere artificially you</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.920" end="00:13:28.800" style="s2">know what i mean we can make we can</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.040" end="00:13:30.720" style="s2">maintain a perfectly livable environment</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.800" end="00:13:32.839" style="s2">like that</p>

<p begin="00:13:46.880" end="00:13:54.000" style="s2">within the within balance with nature</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.959" end="00:13:56.160" style="s2">and we live abundant lives where</p>

<p begin="00:14:01.040" end="00:14:05.600" style="s2">means of production so that it is cradle</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.839" end="00:14:08.320" style="s2">to grave everything&#39;s be able to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.600" end="00:14:10.160" style="s2">reproduced and reused we have access to</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.320" end="00:14:11.519" style="s2">the science so that even</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.160" end="00:14:13.360" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to have the debate</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.519" end="00:14:15.600" style="s2">endlessly on whether climate change is</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.360" end="00:14:17.519" style="s2">real and true we have access to it and</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.600" end="00:14:19.519" style="s2">so we can leave it up to the scientists</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.519" end="00:14:21.279" style="s2">who have our full backing to be like</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.519" end="00:14:23.519" style="s2">yeah okay what do we need to do</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.279" end="00:14:24.880" style="s2">in regards to all the that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.519" end="00:14:27.680" style="s2">pumping into the world</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.880" end="00:14:30.000" style="s2">that if and when climate does change we</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.680" end="00:14:32.399" style="s2">look at it as a global population and</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.000" end="00:14:34.320" style="s2">say hey are some place is not livable</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.399" end="00:14:35.760" style="s2">how do we move humans somewhere else or</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.320" end="00:14:37.440" style="s2">how do we create within that do we live</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.760" end="00:14:40.720" style="s2">in biodomes do we</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.440" end="00:14:42.160" style="s2">do we um regenerate that part and and</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.720" end="00:14:44.399" style="s2">figure out how to do it</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.160" end="00:14:45.519" style="s2">and we work together science is open</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.399" end="00:14:48.480" style="s2">sourced so that</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.519" end="00:14:49.839" style="s2">um it&#39;s not proprietary behind closed</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.480" end="00:14:51.360" style="s2">doors</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.839" end="00:14:53.040" style="s2">we solved climate change so now we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:14:53.040" end="00:14:57.120" style="s2">it&#39;s you know every little incremental</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.360" end="00:14:58.399" style="s2">change we&#39;re sharing and growing so that</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.120" end="00:15:00.320" style="s2">we can we can learn</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.399" end="00:15:02.079" style="s2">and adapt as we come and solution</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.320" end="00:15:03.680" style="s2">raisings exist so that anytime there is</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.079" end="00:15:04.240" style="s2">something that&#39;s that&#39;s crappy in the</p>

<p begin="00:15:04.240" end="00:15:07.360" style="s2">you just need to get ten thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.760" end="00:15:10.079" style="s2">together happy you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.360" end="00:15:11.279" style="s2">have conversations in two to five give</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.079" end="00:15:12.880" style="s2">out the idea the</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.279" end="00:15:15.279" style="s2">solution we vote on the best one and we</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.880" end="00:15:18.160" style="s2">make it and we keep improving it</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.279" end="00:15:20.720" style="s2">we get there that&#39;s my beautiful future</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.160" end="00:15:20.720" style="s2">anyone else</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.199" end="00:15:27.680" style="s2">you go um there are sensors</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.839" end="00:15:31.680" style="s2">everywhere uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.680" end="00:15:36.800" style="s2">iot sensors that can measure</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.680" end="00:15:36.800" style="s2">qualities about our world are</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.279" end="00:15:42.399" style="s2">you know discreetly put everywhere that</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.880" end="00:15:45.600" style="s2">needs to be measured</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.399" end="00:15:46.079" style="s2">and they all talk to each other they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:16:16.639" end="00:16:23.360" style="s2">the the</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.480" end="00:16:24.240" style="s2">a lot of the burden from us in terms of</p>

<p begin="00:16:24.240" end="00:16:31.920" style="s2">and be able to put the pieces together</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.880" end="00:16:34.000" style="s2">so that all we have to do is</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.920" end="00:16:35.360" style="s2">i mean really have an incentive system</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.000" end="00:16:38.720" style="s2">aligned with these</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.360" end="00:16:42.000" style="s2">this iot network such that um</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.720" end="00:16:42.800" style="s2">people get rewarded for doing the thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.000" end="00:16:44.320" style="s2">that is</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.800" end="00:16:45.839" style="s2">the right thing for the environment i</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.320" end="00:16:47.040" style="s2">mean that that&#39;s the real ideal</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.839" end="00:16:51.600" style="s2">situation is that</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.040" end="00:16:55.440" style="s2">you&#39;d have some type of system where</p>

<p begin="00:16:55.440" end="00:16:59.279" style="s2">the world like literally what needs to</p>

<p begin="00:17:02.399" end="00:17:07.280" style="s2">i think the more sensors that we have in</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.360" end="00:17:10.160" style="s2">the world that can talk to each other</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.280" end="00:17:11.919" style="s2">and are powered by ai that can</p>

<p begin="00:17:15.199" end="00:17:19.839" style="s2">my my vision</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.000" end="00:17:24.000" style="s2">it&#39;s funny i guess mine is in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.079" end="00:17:27.039" style="s2">the exact opposite of that</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.000" end="00:17:29.280" style="s2">in that well i kind of feel that</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.039" end="00:17:31.360" style="s2">this this notion that we have any</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.280" end="00:17:34.320" style="s2">inkling of house of steward nature</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.360" end="00:17:35.919" style="s2">is a a beautiful example of human</p>

<p begin="00:17:35.919" end="00:17:38.720" style="s2">that knows how to steward nature is</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.280" end="00:17:41.919" style="s2">nature and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.720" end="00:17:42.799" style="s2">wherever possible leaving alone</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.919" end="00:17:45.919" style="s2">just yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.799" end="00:17:46.320" style="s2">let the world rewild itself just leave</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.919" end="00:17:49.360" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.320" end="00:17:51.520" style="s2"> alone let it sort itself out</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.360" end="00:17:53.039" style="s2">and uh you know only tamper with the</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.520" end="00:17:53.760" style="s2">bits that we absolutely need to tamper</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.039" end="00:17:57.280" style="s2">with right and</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.760" end="00:17:59.280" style="s2">and and leave large swathes as i say</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.280" end="00:18:01.120" style="s2">something those little bubbles of human</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.280" end="00:18:02.559" style="s2">of human occupation right and we</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.120" end="00:18:04.400" style="s2">organize that according to whatever</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.559" end="00:18:05.360" style="s2">needs that we have but then surrounded</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.400" end="00:18:07.679" style="s2">by</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.360" end="00:18:09.520" style="s2">wild that we just that we just</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.679" end="00:18:11.919" style="s2">leave alone and we on and and</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.520" end="00:18:12.720" style="s2">you know the notion of we come from the</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.919" end="00:18:14.799" style="s2">earth</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.720" end="00:18:16.880" style="s2">and and honoring that by leaving the</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.799" end="00:18:18.640" style="s2">earth alone insofar as we can right</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.880" end="00:18:20.000" style="s2">all this modern stuff that we need to do</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.640" end="00:18:23.440" style="s2">we we do</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.000" end="00:18:25.679" style="s2">in enclosed sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.440" end="00:18:27.360" style="s2">anyway i&#39;ve made my point rewilding as</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.679" end="00:18:28.000" style="s2">much as possible is kind of is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.360" end="00:18:30.320" style="s2">what i would like</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.000" end="00:18:30.320" style="s2">to see</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.280" end="00:18:39.200" style="s2">yes my utopian vision is um</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.440" end="00:18:42.880" style="s2">scarcity is a thing of the past</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.200" end="00:18:46.799" style="s2">and i think that if</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.880" end="00:18:50.400" style="s2">we solved for scarcity</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.799" end="00:18:51.280" style="s2">either like real scarcity or what i</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.400" end="00:18:54.559" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.280" end="00:18:57.600" style="s2">in the west living in</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.559" end="00:19:00.880" style="s2">manufactured scarcity through rivalrous</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.600" end="00:19:03.200" style="s2">behavior um i think if we solved for</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.880" end="00:19:06.240" style="s2">scarcity</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.200" end="00:19:10.240" style="s2">people would be able to</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.240" end="00:19:13.919" style="s2">just navigate the world in a in a</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.240" end="00:19:15.600" style="s2">more realistic way we&#39;re competing with</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.919" end="00:19:18.880" style="s2">one another which means we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.600" end="00:19:23.280" style="s2">hoarding and we&#39;re we&#39;re doing damage</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.880" end="00:19:26.320" style="s2">um because we&#39;re not working together um</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.280" end="00:19:27.760" style="s2">i think removing scarcity about in so</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.320" end="00:19:30.960" style="s2">many ways</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.760" end="00:19:33.200" style="s2">that would be um a world i&#39;d want to</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.960" end="00:19:35.840" style="s2">live in</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.200" end="00:19:38.880" style="s2">i&#39;d agree with that i mean i think that</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.840" end="00:19:38.880" style="s2">if we could have</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.960" end="00:19:45.360" style="s2">a world where there was more cooperation</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.120" end="00:19:45.360" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.559" end="00:19:48.799" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.520" end="00:19:56.960" style="s2">unified purpose for trying to solve</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.880" end="00:20:00.080" style="s2">scientific problems and</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.960" end="00:20:03.440" style="s2">um sharing of data i</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.080" end="00:20:05.600" style="s2">i think we&#39;d be in a better place so my</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.440" end="00:20:06.960" style="s2">my utopian vision would be circular</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.600" end="00:20:09.200" style="s2">economies</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.960" end="00:20:10.799" style="s2">that were completely open source that</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.200" end="00:20:14.559" style="s2">people could</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.799" end="00:20:16.960" style="s2">uh really modify</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.559" end="00:20:18.880" style="s2">like just like every product that we</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.960" end="00:20:22.400" style="s2">have right now</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.880" end="00:20:24.320" style="s2">is designed closed sort</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.400" end="00:20:25.760" style="s2">pretty much every product is designed</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.320" end="00:20:28.480" style="s2">closed sourced</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.760" end="00:20:29.919" style="s2">and not circular and i&#39;d like to see the</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.480" end="00:20:32.240" style="s2">opposite of that where like</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.919" end="00:20:34.320" style="s2">every single thing that we design is</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.240" end="00:20:36.799" style="s2">open source and designed to be circular</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.320" end="00:20:40.480" style="s2">and reused and recycled</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.799" end="00:20:44.000" style="s2">and um yeah and that we can move back</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.480" end="00:20:47.039" style="s2">towards more vocal production</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.000" end="00:20:51.280" style="s2">um and local uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.039" end="00:20:53.120" style="s2">resource uh resource control i feel like</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.280" end="00:20:57.039" style="s2">globalization has</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.120" end="00:21:00.880" style="s2">done damage to a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.039" end="00:21:02.720" style="s2">the economics of um</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.880" end="00:21:04.080" style="s2">just people working together in local</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.720" end="00:21:06.400" style="s2">regions</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.080" end="00:21:08.240" style="s2">and i i feel like it would be great if</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.400" end="00:21:11.360" style="s2">we could move back towards like</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.240" end="00:21:12.240" style="s2">you know i want to get this widget i can</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.360" end="00:21:16.000" style="s2">get this widget</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.240" end="00:21:19.360" style="s2">made 10 miles away</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.000" end="00:21:20.320" style="s2">and that widget will come to me the same</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.360" end="00:21:22.320" style="s2">day</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.320" end="00:21:23.919" style="s2">and like we don&#39;t have to ship the</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.320" end="00:21:27.440" style="s2">widgets all the way around the world</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.919" end="00:21:32.559" style="s2">and have all that impact um</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.440" end="00:21:35.280" style="s2">and yeah uh and to the sensors and data</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.559" end="00:21:36.880" style="s2">um all four sensors just let&#39;s make</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.280" end="00:21:41.200" style="s2">cameras</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.880" end="00:21:43.280" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m not big on cameras everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.200" end="00:21:44.799" style="s2">can i just pick up on and just add</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.280" end="00:21:46.240" style="s2">something to what i was saying</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.799" end="00:21:48.080" style="s2">mostly picking up on what you were just</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.240" end="00:21:50.880" style="s2">saying peter um</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.080" end="00:21:52.720" style="s2">this idea of localization i think is it</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.880" end="00:21:54.400" style="s2">it&#39;s not just i mean it is that</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.720" end="00:21:56.240" style="s2">it is also that right sourcing things</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.400" end="00:21:59.440" style="s2">locally reducing blah blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.240" end="00:22:02.559" style="s2">but also it affords the opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.440" end="00:22:03.600" style="s2">for small scale experimentation friendly</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.559" end="00:22:06.000" style="s2">competition</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.600" end="00:22:07.280" style="s2">maybe the gamification of this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.000" end="00:22:10.159" style="s2">right where you can have</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.280" end="00:22:10.880" style="s2">these local nodes in you know entering</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.159" end="00:22:12.799" style="s2">into friendly</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.880" end="00:22:14.159" style="s2">what&#39;s what&#39;s the best solution we can</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.799" end="00:22:15.200" style="s2">come up with we&#39;ve all got similar</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.159" end="00:22:16.799" style="s2">situations all right well</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.200" end="00:22:18.640" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s let&#39;s start a little game</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.799" end="00:22:20.000" style="s2">let&#39;s start a competition between us</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.640" end="00:22:21.360" style="s2">to come up with a solution to this</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.000" end="00:22:23.200" style="s2">particular problem we&#39;ll work on it</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.360" end="00:22:24.720" style="s2">independently and then in whatever three</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.200" end="00:22:27.120" style="s2">months time we&#39;ll get together so</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.720" end="00:22:28.960" style="s2">you know you have uh because there there</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.120" end="00:22:31.360" style="s2">is there is a there is a certain free</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.960" end="00:22:32.799" style="s2">song created by competition right which</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.360" end="00:22:33.760" style="s2">which spurs you on and so if you can</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.799" end="00:22:37.919" style="s2">incorporate that</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.760" end="00:22:39.440" style="s2">somehow into a context of broader</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.919" end="00:22:40.000" style="s2">collaboration right we&#39;re competing</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.440" end="00:22:41.679" style="s2">against each</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.000" end="00:22:43.039" style="s2">other but in the common pursuit of</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.679" end="00:22:44.960" style="s2">something that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.039" end="00:22:47.280" style="s2">benefit all of us right i i really like</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.960" end="00:22:48.799" style="s2">this notion of gamification on small</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.280" end="00:22:51.360" style="s2">scales to actually</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.799" end="00:22:52.720" style="s2">create large-scale solutions that emerge</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.360" end="00:22:55.039" style="s2">to things</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.720" end="00:22:57.039" style="s2">and with that we can switch over into</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.039" end="00:22:59.360" style="s2">the next part which is the beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.039" end="00:23:00.480" style="s2">um what jason possible what could we do</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.360" end="00:23:01.679" style="s2">now with ten thousand people and a</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.480" end="00:23:03.679" style="s2">hundred thousand dollars</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.679" end="00:23:06.240" style="s2">because this is gamifying it right like</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.679" end="00:23:06.240" style="s2">this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.320" end="00:23:09.280" style="s2">there&#39;s dozens of people having these</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.840" end="00:23:10.240" style="s2">and like who comes up with the best</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.280" end="00:23:12.000" style="s2">solution to save the</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.240" end="00:23:13.280" style="s2">world how horrible if someone else does</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.000" end="00:23:14.960" style="s2">right like</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.280" end="00:23:17.120" style="s2">it&#39;s fun to be part of it and but</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.960" end="00:23:18.720" style="s2">hopefully and fun to</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.120" end="00:23:20.320" style="s2">envision a better world and what could</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.720" end="00:23:20.720" style="s2">we actually do if we had ten thousand</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.320" end="00:23:22.080" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.720" end="00:23:24.480" style="s2">and a hundred thousand dollars possibly</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.080" end="00:23:27.120" style="s2">to gamify</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.480" end="00:23:27.919" style="s2">saving the world creating a better</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.120" end="00:23:30.400" style="s2">sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.919" end="00:23:30.400" style="s2">environment</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.000" end="00:23:37.440" style="s2">well i came here uh with an idea already</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.280" end="00:23:38.640" style="s2">that&#39;s pretty short i just the only</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.440" end="00:23:42.000" style="s2">thing i could think of</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.640" end="00:23:44.480" style="s2">was to pick an existing product</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.000" end="00:23:45.279" style="s2">and try to make it better by reducing</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.480" end="00:23:49.039" style="s2">the waste</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.279" end="00:23:52.240" style="s2">somehow it&#39;s not a it&#39;s not a new idea</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.039" end="00:23:55.919" style="s2">um so i i switched over to a laundry</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.240" end="00:23:58.880" style="s2">detergent that uses less plastic because</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.919" end="00:24:00.960" style="s2">you know it&#39;s like little it still uses</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.880" end="00:24:02.960" style="s2">some but it&#39;s like little tide pod</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.960" end="00:24:04.080" style="s2">things but you don&#39;t have the big</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.960" end="00:24:05.440" style="s2">plastic container</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.080" end="00:24:07.600" style="s2">because all those are shipped in a</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.440" end="00:24:09.200" style="s2">cardboard box so i would just like</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.600" end="00:24:10.880" style="s2">target one product</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.200" end="00:24:14.000" style="s2">and say how can we make this more</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.880" end="00:24:16.960" style="s2">environmentally friendly</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.000" end="00:24:20.159" style="s2">i feel like that&#39;s within the scope of</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.960" end="00:24:20.159" style="s2">the solution raising</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.520" end="00:24:27.919" style="s2">i think yeah if we if there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.799" end="00:24:29.840" style="s2">that most people use</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.919" end="00:24:31.279" style="s2">that is also something that the ten</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.840" end="00:24:33.039" style="s2">thousand people could get together and</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.279" end="00:24:35.279" style="s2">say right let&#39;s say detergent</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.039" end="00:24:36.880" style="s2">hey what do you look for in a detergent</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.279" end="00:24:38.400" style="s2">right maybe we have two or three</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.880" end="00:24:41.120" style="s2">detergents one cent free</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.400" end="00:24:42.080" style="s2">one hypoallergenic one regular or we</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.120" end="00:24:45.840" style="s2">start with one</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.080" end="00:24:47.600" style="s2">and figure out how do we produce that</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.840" end="00:24:49.360" style="s2">for those 10 000 people and then if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.600" end="00:24:51.200" style="s2">done in a sustainable way where it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.360" end="00:24:51.840" style="s2">know carbon neutral or whatever we care</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.200" end="00:24:54.640" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.840" end="00:24:56.559" style="s2">um and then ask you right like you can</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.640" end="00:24:57.760" style="s2">already see the transparency of creating</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.559" end="00:24:58.880" style="s2">that product</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.760" end="00:25:00.880" style="s2">that the ten thousand people got</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.880" end="00:25:01.679" style="s2">together to do that so you&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.880" end="00:25:03.440" style="s2">more open</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.679" end="00:25:04.960" style="s2">like you&#39;re not gonna stop at the ten</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.440" end="00:25:06.799" style="s2">thousand right it&#39;s like that&#39;s where it</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.960" end="00:25:09.760" style="s2">starts to say hey what would get you to</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.799" end="00:25:09.760" style="s2">use this detergent</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.360" end="00:25:15.600" style="s2">i like this concept of gamifying things</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.159" end="00:25:18.960" style="s2">uh those brought up</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.600" end="00:25:21.200" style="s2">um i mean i just think about</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.960" end="00:25:22.480" style="s2">how many people play like animal</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.200" end="00:25:25.760" style="s2">crossing</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.480" end="00:25:28.799" style="s2">or like any of these games where like</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.760" end="00:25:32.559" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re entering into this</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.799" end="00:25:35.039" style="s2">uh digital world and</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.559" end="00:25:36.559" style="s2">uh just doing meaningless things in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.039" end="00:25:38.799" style="s2">digital world</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.559" end="00:25:40.000" style="s2">um i&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s a way that</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.799" end="00:25:43.360" style="s2">we could gamify</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.000" end="00:25:46.720" style="s2">people actually doing some</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.360" end="00:25:50.400" style="s2">actual physical thing in the real world</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.720" end="00:25:52.880" style="s2">uh that would have an impact like</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.400" end="00:25:54.320" style="s2">planting trees or i don&#39;t know i mean i</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.880" end="00:25:56.799" style="s2">don&#39;t know what the</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.320" end="00:25:59.279" style="s2">actual solution would be but figure out</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.799" end="00:26:01.440" style="s2">or the range of solutions could be</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.279" end="00:26:03.039" style="s2">um but like figure out ways of</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.440" end="00:26:06.640" style="s2">incentivizing people to</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.039" end="00:26:10.720" style="s2">get out there and do physical</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.640" end="00:26:14.159" style="s2">actions in the real world that manifests</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.720" end="00:26:16.799" style="s2">uh more towards this direction</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.159" end="00:26:18.320" style="s2">but encapsulating that somehow in a game</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.799" end="00:26:21.760" style="s2">has anyone ever seen</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.320" end="00:26:25.279" style="s2">read the book freedom tm</p>

<p begin="00:26:57.840" end="00:27:02.240" style="s2">very different about</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.880" end="00:27:03.840" style="s2">like leveling up together versus like</p>

<p begin="00:27:31.520" end="00:27:34.159" style="s2">if there&#39;s 100 people in each city doing</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.120" end="00:27:35.440" style="s2">it&#39;d be fun</p>

<p begin="00:27:37.600" end="00:27:40.559" style="s2">it scales up so you could do it in a</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.520" end="00:27:41.520" style="s2">neighborhood i mean this is something</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.559" end="00:27:42.799" style="s2">you could even do</p>

<p begin="00:27:42.799" end="00:27:46.080" style="s2">thousand dollars the hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.840" end="00:27:47.760" style="s2">dollars could form a prize pool right</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.080" end="00:27:49.679" style="s2">and so every year every one of the ten</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.760" end="00:27:51.440" style="s2">thousand people pays ten dollars into</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.679" end="00:27:53.039" style="s2">an annual price of 100 which is</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.440" end="00:27:54.799" style="s2">distributed a month and so</p>

<p begin="00:28:02.799" end="00:28:06.480" style="s2">city streets right so this can be a</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.640" end="00:28:08.320" style="s2">competition between cities and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.480" end="00:28:09.679" style="s2">you know the winning city gets whatever</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.320" end="00:28:10.640" style="s2">ten thousand dollars or something out of</p>

<p begin="00:28:14.720" end="00:28:17.440" style="s2">could i i</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.240" end="00:28:19.039" style="s2">certainly as it attracts more than the</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.440" end="00:28:19.679" style="s2">ten thousand this is something that</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.039" end="00:28:21.760" style="s2">could</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.679" end="00:28:23.679" style="s2">that could yeah and i mean picking up</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.760" end="00:28:25.279" style="s2">trash is just one thing right water</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.679" end="00:28:27.279" style="s2">quality i mean this is something that is</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.279" end="00:28:28.880" style="s2">measurable right you can send people out</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.279" end="00:28:30.159" style="s2">to test the water that comes out the</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.880" end="00:28:32.240" style="s2">taps in people&#39;s homes</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.159" end="00:28:34.480" style="s2">in various different neighborhoods</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.240" end="00:28:35.440" style="s2">cities regions countries right and they</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.480" end="00:28:37.600" style="s2">can all be</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.440" end="00:28:39.760" style="s2">competing against each other for whose</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.600" end="00:28:41.440" style="s2">citizens are drinking the cleanest water</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.760" end="00:28:43.679" style="s2">right what a great competition to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.440" end="00:28:46.880" style="s2">involved in</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.679" end="00:28:47.919" style="s2">uh that&#39;s cool i i&#39;m i like the idea for</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.880" end="00:28:51.120" style="s2">the incentives</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.919" end="00:28:53.440" style="s2">i mean and</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.120" end="00:28:55.279" style="s2">talking about i don&#39;t eat out very much</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.440" end="00:28:56.320" style="s2">because i walk to my grocery store and i</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.279" end="00:28:59.039" style="s2">cook all my food</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.320" end="00:28:59.600" style="s2">because that&#39;s you know i&#39;m using less</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.039" end="00:29:02.320" style="s2">fuel</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.600" end="00:29:03.360" style="s2">i&#39;m creating less pollution it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.320" end="00:29:06.640" style="s2">very cool</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.360" end="00:29:10.480" style="s2">i&#39;ll tell you what like it doesn&#39;t seem</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.640" end="00:29:13.360" style="s2">cool to in my world um</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.480" end="00:29:14.480" style="s2">to other people or i leave all my lights</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.360" end="00:29:17.279" style="s2">off most of the time</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.480" end="00:29:17.840" style="s2">in my house because it saves energy and</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.279" end="00:29:21.919" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.840" end="00:29:24.399" style="s2">also not very cool but if i had a way to</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.919" end="00:29:26.559" style="s2">yeah like get points on a scoreboard or</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.399" end="00:29:30.320" style="s2">something and i&#39;m competing</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.559" end="00:29:32.480" style="s2">for less impact</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.320" end="00:29:33.760" style="s2">kilowatt hours per person in households</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.480" end="00:29:35.200" style="s2">or something like that there we go</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.760" end="00:29:37.440" style="s2">there&#39;s another competition</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.200" end="00:29:39.360" style="s2">absolutely this is all easily done right</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.440" end="00:29:41.760" style="s2">easily sorted out easily done</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.360" end="00:29:43.039" style="s2">it&#39;s a great idea i think it&#39;d be cool</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.760" end="00:29:46.399" style="s2">if we could mix</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.039" end="00:29:49.360" style="s2">the the different areas of impact i mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.399" end="00:29:50.320" style="s2">we&#39;ve mentioned water electricity waste</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.360" end="00:29:53.039" style="s2">management</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.320" end="00:29:54.000" style="s2">like if if there&#39;s a scoring system that</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.039" end="00:29:57.360" style="s2">could say</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.000" end="00:29:58.799" style="s2">okay maybe i&#39;ve like left my lights on</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.360" end="00:30:00.159" style="s2">in my house but i&#39;ve got a warm</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.799" end="00:30:03.120" style="s2">composter</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.159" end="00:30:05.760" style="s2">so like i can compare those different</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.120" end="00:30:05.760" style="s2">behaviors</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.720" end="00:30:09.600" style="s2">yeah so the warm composter gets you what</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.480" end="00:30:10.880" style="s2">plus a hundred points a month and</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.600" end="00:30:12.399" style="s2">leaving your lights on gets you minus a</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.880" end="00:30:14.240" style="s2">point a day or something like that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.399" end="00:30:15.440" style="s2">exactly sense of what the relative</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.240" end="00:30:17.279" style="s2">impacts of these things are</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.440" end="00:30:18.559" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah yeah absolutely it can</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.279" end="00:30:19.440" style="s2">have that built into it also that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.559" end="00:30:21.600" style="s2">really good idea</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.440" end="00:30:23.279" style="s2">that&#39;s a really good idea it almost</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.600" end="00:30:25.279" style="s2">becomes like a currency then right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.279" end="00:30:26.960" style="s2">a way of valuing it it almost becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.279" end="00:30:28.640" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.960" end="00:30:30.080" style="s2">a measurement of value yeah it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.640" end="00:30:31.440" style="s2">cool that&#39;s very cool i like that and if</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.080" end="00:30:33.360" style="s2">we&#39;re doing it together</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.440" end="00:30:35.760" style="s2">then we can also see where the</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.360" end="00:30:38.159" style="s2">incentives we got the incentives wrong</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.760" end="00:30:39.840" style="s2">right like i&#39;m part of the co-housing</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.159" end="00:30:41.840" style="s2">group and they have this recycling room</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.840" end="00:30:43.840" style="s2">that they all they all use</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.840" end="00:30:45.120" style="s2">and they&#39;re like they have this</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.840" end="00:30:46.720" style="s2">competition of like</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.120" end="00:30:48.080" style="s2">not a competition competition we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.720" end="00:30:50.080" style="s2">like can we use less waste right we</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.080" end="00:30:51.760" style="s2">don&#39;t have enough room</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.080" end="00:30:53.039" style="s2">and i&#39;m like but wait like if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.760" end="00:30:54.480" style="s2">bringing in less you&#39;re just gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.039" end="00:30:56.240" style="s2">throwing out stuff if you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.480" end="00:30:57.679" style="s2">bring down your recycling right so that</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.240" end="00:30:59.360" style="s2">you&#39;re using less it&#39;s like that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.679" end="00:31:00.480" style="s2">wrong incentive</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.360" end="00:31:01.760" style="s2">it&#39;s like there has to be something</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.480" end="00:31:02.799" style="s2">bigger but you could see that because</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.760" end="00:31:05.519" style="s2">it&#39;s a small community</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.799" end="00:31:07.519" style="s2">right so so it&#39;s more obvious and so to</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.519" end="00:31:08.640" style="s2">say oh like we&#39;re picking up trash right</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.519" end="00:31:10.080" style="s2">vancouver&#39;s picking up trash and</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.640" end="00:31:12.080" style="s2">toronto&#39;s picking up trash</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.080" end="00:31:13.519" style="s2">oh wait vancouver&#39;s throwing more trash</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.080" end="00:31:14.399" style="s2">on the ground so that we can pick up</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.519" end="00:31:16.320" style="s2">more trash</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.399" end="00:31:18.240" style="s2">right so like let&#39;s let&#39;s figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.320" end="00:31:20.960" style="s2">to how to re-organize</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.240" end="00:31:22.640" style="s2">the um the incentives so that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.960" end="00:31:23.679" style="s2">actually having the impact that we want</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.640" end="00:31:25.519" style="s2">to have</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.679" end="00:31:27.200" style="s2">can i can i throw one other idea this is</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.519" end="00:31:28.799" style="s2">not my idea this is the</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.200" end="00:31:30.799" style="s2">jubilee you know you know where this</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.799" end="00:31:32.559" style="s2">ideas come from um but</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.799" end="00:31:34.159" style="s2">i i think that it&#39;s well worth</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.559" end="00:31:35.600" style="s2">mentioning here and maybe it&#39;ll plant a</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.159" end="00:31:36.080" style="s2">seed in someone that goes somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.600" end="00:31:38.399" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.080" end="00:31:40.080" style="s2">um but kylie who we have a regular call</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.399" end="00:31:42.159" style="s2">with on wednesday has this notion of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.080" end="00:31:44.000" style="s2">global commons trust and this fits into</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.159" end="00:31:46.240" style="s2">this potentially really well right</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.000" end="00:31:48.000" style="s2">and that i don&#39;t fully understand it but</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.240" end="00:31:48.880" style="s2">basically the idea is that there you</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.000" end="00:31:50.640" style="s2">know that</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.880" end="00:31:52.320" style="s2">there is commons out there right there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.640" end="00:31:54.080" style="s2">all kinds of commons not just the</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.320" end="00:31:56.960" style="s2">environment the air the water but</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.080" end="00:31:58.799" style="s2">you know trust and uh you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.960" end="00:32:00.240" style="s2">all kinds of commons out there and when</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.799" end="00:32:02.640" style="s2">damage is done to the commons</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.240" end="00:32:06.880" style="s2">compensation for that damage should be</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.640" end="00:32:10.480" style="s2">should be um made payable right and and</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.880" end="00:32:12.320" style="s2">so this this fits the the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.480" end="00:32:13.919" style="s2">this as a currency with which the</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.320" end="00:32:14.880" style="s2">commons can be valued right because</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.919" end="00:32:16.320" style="s2">that&#39;s what we&#39;re talking about we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.880" end="00:32:18.080" style="s2">talking about cleaning up things that</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.320" end="00:32:19.840" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about cleaning up things</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.080" end="00:32:23.200" style="s2">which are rightly</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.840" end="00:32:26.159" style="s2">part of the commons um so it&#39;s a way of</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.200" end="00:32:28.080" style="s2">valuing and incentivizing and ordering</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.159" end="00:32:29.840" style="s2">that potentially as well i i</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.080" end="00:32:32.159" style="s2">this is actually i&#39;m we&#39;re gonna have to</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.840" end="00:32:35.360" style="s2">tell kylie about this conversation later</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.159" end="00:32:38.480" style="s2">jubilee i think this</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.360" end="00:32:39.200" style="s2">this lines up really well with some of</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.480" end="00:32:44.320" style="s2">my</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.200" end="00:32:44.320" style="s2">um kind of thoughts about</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.480" end="00:32:50.159" style="s2">changing the game that we play um</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.600" end="00:32:51.120" style="s2">right now we play the game of capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.159" end="00:32:53.519" style="s2">where we earn</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.120" end="00:32:55.200" style="s2">as much money as we possibly can who can</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.519" end="00:32:57.279" style="s2">earn the most and a lot of people have</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.200" end="00:32:57.840" style="s2">won that there are winners of capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.279" end="00:33:00.480" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.840" end="00:33:01.679" style="s2">how do you get the winners of capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.480" end="00:33:05.440" style="s2">to play a different</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.679" end="00:33:08.399" style="s2">game that can help the world</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.440" end="00:33:09.360" style="s2">and my just immediate thought on that</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.399" end="00:33:12.000" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.360" end="00:33:13.679" style="s2">in a gamification side of things for</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.000" end="00:33:16.799" style="s2">every one dollar you get</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.679" end="00:33:18.399" style="s2">one karma point right and that karma</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.799" end="00:33:18.799" style="s2">point is measured on a digital system</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.399" end="00:33:22.080" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.799" end="00:33:24.240" style="s2">people are playing it has to be adopted</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.080" end="00:33:27.600" style="s2">by people right obviously but that</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.240" end="00:33:29.120" style="s2">this is a point that you you have on</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.600" end="00:33:30.880" style="s2">your profile in the same way you&#39;d have</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.120" end="00:33:32.080" style="s2">like an rpg or something of that nature</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.880" end="00:33:34.559" style="s2">you can have different</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.080" end="00:33:35.600" style="s2">types of karma points right i just came</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.559" end="00:33:37.120" style="s2">up with the name karma points like it</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.600" end="00:33:40.399" style="s2">could be anything</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.120" end="00:33:41.679" style="s2">bitcoin for this no because bitcoin can</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.399" end="00:33:43.600" style="s2">be traded this would be something for</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.679" end="00:33:44.320" style="s2">hollow chain i think which holochain if</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.600" end="00:33:45.600" style="s2">you guys haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.320" end="00:33:47.840" style="s2">looked into holochain it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.600" end="00:33:51.200" style="s2">awesome uh but holochain</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.840" end="00:33:52.320" style="s2">is it it can measure like let&#39;s say for</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.200" end="00:33:55.519" style="s2">example i put</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.320" end="00:33:58.480" style="s2">a million dollars towards something that</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.519" end="00:33:59.840" style="s2">is helping the commons right like i</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.480" end="00:34:00.559" style="s2">don&#39;t need that million dollars anymore</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.840" end="00:34:02.880" style="s2">the commons</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.559" end="00:34:04.640" style="s2">has that like boom it&#39;s traded away but</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.880" end="00:34:06.240" style="s2">like i should have</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.640" end="00:34:08.079" style="s2">there should be a status that showed</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.240" end="00:34:10.159" style="s2">that i did that because</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.079" end="00:34:11.440" style="s2">then it&#39;s like oh look at me i still</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.159" end="00:34:14.399" style="s2">have my</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.440" end="00:34:16.079" style="s2">competition status going on like i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.399" end="00:34:17.520" style="s2">done blah blah blah you can keep this</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.079" end="00:34:20.560" style="s2">whole</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.520" end="00:34:22.800" style="s2">rivalrous dynamic going on yet</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.560" end="00:34:24.159" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t really it can be digital it</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.800" end="00:34:27.280" style="s2">doesn&#39;t need to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.159" end="00:34:30.159" style="s2">in real life if that makes sense so um</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.280" end="00:34:32.000" style="s2">we can be competing to better the</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.159" end="00:34:34.399" style="s2">commons</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.000" end="00:34:35.919" style="s2">i like that for one instead of your like</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.399" end="00:34:37.760" style="s2">net worth right you can start bragging</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.919" end="00:34:40.000" style="s2">about right or whatever that is</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.760" end="00:34:41.520" style="s2">but also when people who are</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.000" end="00:34:43.760" style="s2">billionaires like bill gates</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.520" end="00:34:44.560" style="s2">and and elon musk and stuff like they</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.760" end="00:34:45.919" style="s2">have their vision</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.560" end="00:34:47.599" style="s2">their utopian vision of what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.919" end="00:34:48.240" style="s2">trying to create in the world and a big</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.599" end="00:34:50.320" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.240" end="00:34:52.159" style="s2">is wait you&#39;ve got that money us</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.320" end="00:34:53.599" style="s2">all over that&#39;s a problem</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.159" end="00:34:55.200" style="s2">and then you think you can envision a</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.599" end="00:34:56.480" style="s2">better world but there&#39;s something kind</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.200" end="00:34:58.320" style="s2">of cool about them just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.480" end="00:35:00.480" style="s2">giving it back to the commons to decide</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.320" end="00:35:01.680" style="s2">what that is so that we get to decide</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.480" end="00:35:03.119" style="s2">and so the people who are already kind</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.680" end="00:35:04.640" style="s2">of losing a game a</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.119" end="00:35:06.160" style="s2">can be part of the people that decide</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.640" end="00:35:07.040" style="s2">what is actually going to be done with</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.160" end="00:35:08.640" style="s2">that money</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.040" end="00:35:10.960" style="s2">and not done with like oh i give a</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.640" end="00:35:13.119" style="s2">million dollars to cancer research</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.960" end="00:35:14.160" style="s2">right and they they threw a gala and</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.119" end="00:35:15.920" style="s2">they you know like</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.160" end="00:35:17.599" style="s2">made a pharmaceutical thing that they</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.920" end="00:35:18.880" style="s2">made money off of that&#39;s not actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.599" end="00:35:20.480" style="s2">giving it to the commons we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.880" end="00:35:23.280" style="s2">actually cure cancer with that</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.480" end="00:35:24.160" style="s2">like having it be transparent anyway</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.280" end="00:35:26.800" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.160" end="00:35:27.760" style="s2">i love that and there&#39;s there&#39;s ways to</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.800" end="00:35:29.200" style="s2">make</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.760" end="00:35:30.000" style="s2">to make it so that and i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.200" end="00:35:32.880" style="s2">thinking about this a little bit but</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.000" end="00:35:36.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a way to do like a one-to-one</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.880" end="00:35:39.280" style="s2">kind of um uh matching</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.240" end="00:35:40.320" style="s2">from a a point that&#39;s on your system</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.280" end="00:35:43.680" style="s2">that&#39;s in your</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.320" end="00:35:47.440" style="s2">in your digital record</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.680" end="00:35:50.240" style="s2">right but also getting up</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.440" end="00:35:52.079" style="s2">a dollar in whatever this currency is as</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.240" end="00:35:53.680" style="s2">well so like this could be a currency</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.079" end="00:35:56.000" style="s2">specifically for</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.680" end="00:35:58.480" style="s2">altruistic things or like helping the</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.000" end="00:36:00.000" style="s2">commons so it could be you you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.480" end="00:36:01.680" style="s2">multiply your worth</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.000" end="00:36:04.560" style="s2">like for every one dollar you put in you</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.680" end="00:36:06.480" style="s2">get one status point and one</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.560" end="00:36:08.160" style="s2">currency digital currency that you can</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.480" end="00:36:11.280" style="s2">actually do something with</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.160" end="00:36:14.960" style="s2">in a that could help the world</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.280" end="00:36:17.680" style="s2">um that that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.960" end="00:36:18.160" style="s2">shift in thinking i think we if we lean</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.680" end="00:36:21.040" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.160" end="00:36:22.400" style="s2">the fact that the digital world is</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.040" end="00:36:26.640" style="s2">limitless</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.400" end="00:36:29.440" style="s2">we can trick people into like</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.640" end="00:36:30.560" style="s2">basically just like oh yeah like i want</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.440" end="00:36:32.560" style="s2">this now i want</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.560" end="00:36:34.480" style="s2">this status in this digital world and to</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.560" end="00:36:36.000" style="s2">get that i have to</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.480" end="00:36:37.440" style="s2">give all this money or do all these</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.000" end="00:36:39.280" style="s2">things in order to help the real world</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.440" end="00:36:40.000" style="s2">like sure okay but as long as i get my</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.280" end="00:36:41.680" style="s2">like so and so</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.000" end="00:36:43.119" style="s2">right like you can there&#39;s layers of</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.680" end="00:36:45.440" style="s2">motivation you can have that</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.119" end="00:36:46.800" style="s2">initial hedonistic motivation of like i</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.440" end="00:36:49.200" style="s2">just want to have status</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.800" end="00:36:50.079" style="s2">that eventually if you&#39;re constantly</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.200" end="00:36:52.880" style="s2">looking for</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.079" end="00:36:53.520" style="s2">good things to do in the world that</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.880" end="00:36:55.280" style="s2">might</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.520" end="00:36:57.280" style="s2">change and even if it doesn&#39;t change</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.280" end="00:37:00.960" style="s2">like what&#39;s the difference</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.280" end="00:37:03.440" style="s2">if you have somebody that&#39;s doing good</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.960" end="00:37:05.119" style="s2">versus someone who is motivated to do</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.440" end="00:37:06.640" style="s2">good because of what like what about who</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.119" end="00:37:10.160" style="s2">cares about their motivations if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.640" end="00:37:12.720" style="s2">if everyone is doing that like</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.160" end="00:37:13.280" style="s2">you know i i don&#39;t know i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.720" end="00:37:14.960" style="s2">awesome</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.280" end="00:37:16.960" style="s2">until you make it basically until you</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.960" end="00:37:17.599" style="s2">make it yeah and even if you don&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.960" end="00:37:19.680" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.599" end="00:37:20.960" style="s2">you can just keep faking it yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.680" end="00:37:24.160" style="s2">who&#39;s going to judge you for that</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.960" end="00:37:25.520" style="s2">like come on it makes it easier to be a</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.160" end="00:37:26.000" style="s2">good person than it is to be a bad</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.520" end="00:37:27.680" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.000" end="00:37:29.599" style="s2">like that that&#39;s the kind of system yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.680" end="00:37:33.280" style="s2">absolutely absolutely this</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.599" end="00:37:36.560" style="s2">would this work so let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.280" end="00:37:39.760" style="s2">i saved up let&#39;s say i need</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.560" end="00:37:43.280" style="s2">new shoes and i saved up enough money</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.760" end="00:37:46.400" style="s2">and i could buy brand new nikes</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.280" end="00:37:50.000" style="s2">um because that would be cool uh</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.400" end="00:37:53.359" style="s2">and that would make me look like</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.000" end="00:37:56.000" style="s2">hey he&#39;s got money he&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.359" end="00:37:58.320" style="s2">you know got it going on um i want to</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.000" end="00:37:58.320" style="s2">hang out</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.560" end="00:38:04.560" style="s2">i&#39;m just trying to be realistic here uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.839" end="00:38:06.079" style="s2">but instead i go to the thrift store and</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.560" end="00:38:08.400" style="s2">i buy some used</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.079" end="00:38:09.440" style="s2">shoes because they&#39;ll probably work just</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.400" end="00:38:12.960" style="s2">as good</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.440" end="00:38:16.320" style="s2">for a while so can i get</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.960" end="00:38:18.320" style="s2">points for buying at the thrift store</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.320" end="00:38:19.760" style="s2">you could you know take this analogy out</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.320" end="00:38:22.880" style="s2">of vehicles as well</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.760" end="00:38:24.640" style="s2">to buy a new car that&#39;s shiny and gets</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.880" end="00:38:27.440" style="s2">me lots of attention</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.640" end="00:38:28.560" style="s2">um or i could buy a car that&#39;s 10 years</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.440" end="00:38:30.839" style="s2">old</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.560" end="00:38:32.720" style="s2">because that&#39;s probably you know better</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.839" end="00:38:35.280" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.720" end="00:38:36.160" style="s2">how does this transfer into that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.280" end="00:38:39.040" style="s2">thinking</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.160" end="00:38:41.200" style="s2">to rip off that everywhere right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.040" end="00:38:43.680" style="s2">it&#39;s everywhere but but to riff off that</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.200" end="00:38:44.480" style="s2">it would have to be well a decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.680" end="00:38:46.640" style="s2">so it&#39;s not one</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.480" end="00:38:47.680" style="s2">person or company controlling all this</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.640" end="00:38:51.040" style="s2">but the</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.680" end="00:38:51.760" style="s2">the idea would be like you could either</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.040" end="00:38:54.000" style="s2">get something</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.760" end="00:38:55.280" style="s2">outside of the system or something</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.000" end="00:38:58.320" style="s2">inside of the system</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.280" end="00:38:59.359" style="s2">and whatever is inside of the system is</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.320" end="00:39:01.760" style="s2">good for the world</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.359" end="00:39:03.359" style="s2">and whatever is outside of the system is</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.760" end="00:39:06.640" style="s2">whatever right so</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.359" end="00:39:08.320" style="s2">you you get points for doing something</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.640" end="00:39:11.280" style="s2">that is good for the world so</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.320" end="00:39:12.079" style="s2">if i get a some nikes but these nikes</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.280" end="00:39:14.640" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.079" end="00:39:15.359" style="s2">not in the system they don&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.640" end="00:39:17.760" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.359" end="00:39:19.119" style="s2">they haven&#39;t been accepted into because</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.760" end="00:39:20.800" style="s2">they are</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.119" end="00:39:22.160" style="s2">doing some shitty stuff to the world</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.800" end="00:39:24.160" style="s2">right then</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.160" end="00:39:25.760" style="s2">i&#39;m probably not you know i could buy</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.160" end="00:39:29.040" style="s2">those or i could get</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.760" end="00:39:30.160" style="s2">a pair of shoes that are verified in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.040" end="00:39:34.000" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.160" end="00:39:35.040" style="s2">for like though that company has offset</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.000" end="00:39:38.400" style="s2">their carbon costs</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.040" end="00:39:41.440" style="s2">and they have recorded that on a um</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.400" end="00:39:43.040" style="s2">a system that tracks that i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.440" end="00:39:46.320" style="s2">know but like</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.040" end="00:39:48.000" style="s2">if i get those shoes then i get x amount</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.320" end="00:39:50.960" style="s2">of points versus if i get</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.000" end="00:39:51.839" style="s2">the shitty nikes i don&#39;t get any points</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.960" end="00:39:54.720" style="s2">right like</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.839" end="00:39:55.440" style="s2">that that kind of dynamic is what i was</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.720" end="00:39:59.520" style="s2">thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.440" end="00:40:01.359" style="s2">like ecological ethics incentives</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.520" end="00:40:03.040" style="s2">well i i don&#39;t see why it can&#39;t be both</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.359" end="00:40:04.319" style="s2">i mean i don&#39;t see why it can&#39;t also be</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.040" end="00:40:06.560" style="s2">what daniel was saying right</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.319" end="00:40:08.480" style="s2">that you you make a choice to buy</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.560" end="00:40:10.079" style="s2">something used rather than something new</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.480" end="00:40:12.720" style="s2">and i don&#39;t why can&#39;t you get a karma</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.079" end="00:40:14.160" style="s2">point for that right you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.720" end="00:40:15.839" style="s2">growing your own tomatoes instead of</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.160" end="00:40:17.440" style="s2">buying tomatoes in the supermarket</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.839" end="00:40:20.079" style="s2">surely that&#39;s worth a karma point you</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.440" end="00:40:21.440" style="s2">know or whatever but i i see no reason</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.079" end="00:40:23.280" style="s2">why behaviors</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.440" end="00:40:24.800" style="s2">can&#39;t also be rewarded i don&#39;t see why</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.280" end="00:40:27.440" style="s2">it needs to be consumer choices</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.800" end="00:40:29.440" style="s2">behaviors also then</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.440" end="00:40:30.720" style="s2">certainly the there is the potential to</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.440" end="00:40:32.319" style="s2">to accommodate that i mean</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.720" end="00:40:34.240" style="s2">exactly how it works i don&#39;t know i mean</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.319" end="00:40:36.079" style="s2">it&#39;s complex right but but</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.240" end="00:40:37.280" style="s2">i see no reason why behaviors can&#39;t also</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.079" end="00:40:40.560" style="s2">be incentivized in that</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.280" end="00:40:44.800" style="s2">in that sort of way so i think that um</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.560" end="00:40:48.240" style="s2">one thing to consider is</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.800" end="00:40:50.000" style="s2">where where these karma points will</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.240" end="00:40:54.560" style="s2">aggregate</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.000" end="00:40:57.040" style="s2">um and this is something uh</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.560" end="00:40:57.680" style="s2">that reminds me a lot of berkshire bucks</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.040" end="00:41:01.119" style="s2">which was</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.680" end="00:41:03.040" style="s2">a actual second currency in the u.s</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.119" end="00:41:04.480" style="s2">that got approved in western</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.040" end="00:41:07.200" style="s2">massachusetts</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.480" end="00:41:09.359" style="s2">um as a local currency is reagan&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.200" end="00:41:12.720" style="s2">treasury secretary who did it</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.359" end="00:41:15.040" style="s2">um and basically they created the second</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.720" end="00:41:18.560" style="s2">currency for like local shopping</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.040" end="00:41:21.440" style="s2">it was a big trial um everybody</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.560" end="00:41:22.880" style="s2">went and shopped locally except they had</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.440" end="00:41:25.200" style="s2">this huge problem where</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.880" end="00:41:26.560" style="s2">after doing it for a year the</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.200" end="00:41:32.160" style="s2">supermarket</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.560" end="00:41:34.480" style="s2">had like a huge amount berkshire bucks</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.160" end="00:41:36.880" style="s2">that they could not spend with their</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.480" end="00:41:39.760" style="s2">just like distributors</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.880" end="00:41:40.720" style="s2">across the nation because they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.760" end="00:41:43.920" style="s2">want to accept</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.720" end="00:41:45.520" style="s2">berkshire bucks like so so trying to</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.920" end="00:41:48.720" style="s2">figure out like</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.520" end="00:41:51.839" style="s2">what what will happen with the flow</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.720" end="00:41:54.000" style="s2">of secondary currencies</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.839" end="00:41:55.200" style="s2">i mean bitcoin&#39;s an interesting example</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.000" end="00:41:57.119" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.200" end="00:41:58.560" style="s2">it actually managed to gain traction</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.119" end="00:42:02.319" style="s2">globally</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.560" end="00:42:03.200" style="s2">um it went from nothing to significant</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.319" end="00:42:06.160" style="s2">value</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.200" end="00:42:06.880" style="s2">in a comparatively short period of time</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.160" end="00:42:10.720" style="s2">i mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.880" end="00:42:13.599" style="s2">a decade um so</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.720" end="00:42:14.079" style="s2">yeah it it it&#39;s interesting to think</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.599" end="00:42:17.839" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.079" end="00:42:17.839" style="s2">kind of uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.119" end="00:42:26.640" style="s2">how you deal with monetary flows and</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.960" end="00:42:28.839" style="s2">whether uh other incentive systems will</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.640" end="00:42:31.839" style="s2">act like monetary flows</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.839" end="00:42:31.839" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.440" end="00:42:37.599" style="s2">is with currency maybe it&#39;s just you</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.359" end="00:42:38.880" style="s2">know points karma points or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.599" end="00:42:41.520" style="s2">it&#39;s not something you can explain</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.880" end="00:42:43.200" style="s2">later but you can be like wow look at my</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.520" end="00:42:44.480" style="s2">progress it&#39;s building up</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.200" end="00:42:48.079" style="s2">and you could compare it with your</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.480" end="00:42:50.319" style="s2">friends or something like that and</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.079" end="00:42:51.119" style="s2">you know right now the only thing with</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.319" end="00:42:53.920" style="s2">my friends</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.119" end="00:42:54.319" style="s2">is hey i just bought a brand new uh you</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.920" end="00:42:58.000" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.319" end="00:43:01.200" style="s2">car and how cool was that</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.000" end="00:43:02.160" style="s2">i mention also um daniel&#39;s brought up a</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.200" end="00:43:04.160" style="s2">few times that like</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.160" end="00:43:05.839" style="s2">feeling of not being cool because of</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.160" end="00:43:07.200" style="s2">working in this space right and feeling</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.839" end="00:43:08.640" style="s2">like the rest like</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.200" end="00:43:10.960" style="s2">there&#39;s so much that needs to change in</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.640" end="00:43:12.880" style="s2">the world and people want the change but</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.960" end="00:43:14.240" style="s2">they also don&#39;t want to be judged for</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.880" end="00:43:16.560" style="s2">that change right like the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.240" end="00:43:18.720" style="s2">people who care about fashion and makeup</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.560" end="00:43:20.560" style="s2">and they want to be able to to like well</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.720" end="00:43:22.000" style="s2">i don&#39;t want a new dress every every</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.560" end="00:43:23.200" style="s2">every time i go to a new event but i</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.000" end="00:43:25.040" style="s2">have to buy a new dress because</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.200" end="00:43:28.079" style="s2">otherwise people are going to judge me</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.040" end="00:43:29.680" style="s2">creating a space a culture of like</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.079" end="00:43:31.119" style="s2">inclusivity where it doesn&#39;t matter what</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.680" end="00:43:33.119" style="s2">the outside world thinks</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.119" end="00:43:34.480" style="s2">because we accept you for that right and</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.119" end="00:43:36.880" style="s2">like we know it&#39;s cool</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.480" end="00:43:38.160" style="s2">to buy the secondhand shoes instead of</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.880" end="00:43:39.680" style="s2">the nike shoes</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.160" end="00:43:41.280" style="s2">and even if you don&#39;t mean your small</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.680" end="00:43:42.960" style="s2">town or your big city you can&#39;t see it</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.280" end="00:43:44.800" style="s2">but there&#39;s some amount of online space</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.960" end="00:43:45.440" style="s2">and you know the people local to connect</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.800" end="00:43:47.119" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.440" end="00:43:48.880" style="s2">although that maybe isn&#39;t the solution</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.119" end="00:43:49.520" style="s2">for climate change it is right because</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.880" end="00:43:51.359" style="s2">if you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.520" end="00:43:52.640" style="s2">if you don&#39;t feel like you can make</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.359" end="00:43:54.000" style="s2">those changes</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.640" end="00:43:56.480" style="s2">because of the judgment of the outside</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.000" end="00:43:58.720" style="s2">world everyone feels that way</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.480" end="00:44:00.640" style="s2">right and so giving people a space it to</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.720" end="00:44:03.200" style="s2">be just like pokemon go</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.640" end="00:44:04.640" style="s2">solution i&#39;m sorry um climate change</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.200" end="00:44:07.119" style="s2">game incentivized</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.640" end="00:44:09.040" style="s2">hey right like this is this is fun</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.119" end="00:44:10.400" style="s2">getting like leonardo dicaprio on it</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.040" end="00:44:11.520" style="s2">getting people on it they kind of do</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.400" end="00:44:14.319" style="s2">make it cooler</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.520" end="00:44:15.839" style="s2">and also creating it in a way where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.319" end="00:44:16.160" style="s2">like who cares if they&#39;re involved or</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.839" end="00:44:17.599" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.160" end="00:44:19.440" style="s2">we think it&#39;s cool and we like it</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.599" end="00:44:20.880" style="s2">there&#39;s ten thousand of us right and</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.440" end="00:44:21.920" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna sell we&#39;re gonna sell it</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.880" end="00:44:23.040" style="s2">we&#39;re going to tell people about it</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.920" end="00:44:25.200" style="s2">we&#39;re going to word them out get other</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.040" end="00:44:26.800" style="s2">people involved because we&#39;re having fun</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.200" end="00:44:28.800" style="s2">and doing it and that&#39;s what anything we</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.800" end="00:44:30.800" style="s2">create hopefully is that it&#39;s a natural</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.800" end="00:44:33.920" style="s2">attractor</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.800" end="00:44:35.200" style="s2">and to to add to that this</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.920" end="00:44:36.319" style="s2">i&#39;m not going to go too deep into it</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.200" end="00:44:38.079" style="s2">because it would be a little bit too</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.319" end="00:44:41.040" style="s2">much to explain right now but</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.079" end="00:44:41.440" style="s2">another incentive that you could add to</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.040" end="00:44:44.480" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.440" end="00:44:45.760" style="s2">is that this each of these points these</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.480" end="00:44:49.520" style="s2">karma points whatever you want to</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.760" end="00:44:53.599" style="s2">say are they can also add to</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.520" end="00:44:54.480" style="s2">your ai currency if you will so what if</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.599" end="00:44:58.079" style="s2">everyone had an</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.480" end="00:45:00.400" style="s2">ai concierge that could do</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.079" end="00:45:02.480" style="s2">anything that you wanted and they were</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.400" end="00:45:06.079" style="s2">paid in this currency</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.480" end="00:45:08.000" style="s2">so in order to get your ai concierge</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.079" end="00:45:09.119" style="s2">to line up your life the way you want it</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.000" end="00:45:12.000" style="s2">to be to to</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.119" end="00:45:14.400" style="s2">to do to make life super easy all you</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.000" end="00:45:17.680" style="s2">have to do is</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.400" end="00:45:18.800" style="s2">x right what is that x and like how can</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.680" end="00:45:21.280" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.800" end="00:45:22.000" style="s2">kind of create a system like that</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.280" end="00:45:24.880" style="s2">because that</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.000" end="00:45:26.960" style="s2">that would be nice if you just had a</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.880" end="00:45:28.319" style="s2">concierge 24 7 that would do whatever</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.960" end="00:45:29.680" style="s2">you wanted to and all you had to do was</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.319" end="00:45:33.839" style="s2">pay it in</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.680" end="00:45:33.839" style="s2">a uh</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.000" end="00:45:39.520" style="s2">that&#39;s it that&#39;s all you got to do it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.760" end="00:45:41.920" style="s2">just giving people access</p>

<p begin="00:46:30.079" end="00:46:32.240" style="s2">credit system or something where</p>

<p begin="00:46:32.240" end="00:46:35.520" style="s2">just by being a person has a certain</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.480" end="00:46:38.640" style="s2">amount of credit that</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.520" end="00:46:40.560" style="s2">by using the system and doing what the</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.640" end="00:46:43.760" style="s2">system says which was</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.560" end="00:46:47.200" style="s2">it inherently will make the world better</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.760" end="00:46:49.440" style="s2">somehow you know with x then if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.200" end="00:46:50.400" style="s2">an active member of the system you pay</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.440" end="00:46:53.599" style="s2">off that</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.400" end="00:46:56.400" style="s2">that ai debt and then incur</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.599" end="00:46:58.079" style="s2">more than get more ai wealth to do more</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.400" end="00:47:00.000" style="s2">things with this ai so</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.079" end="00:47:01.920" style="s2">i mean imagine going to a starbucks</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.000" end="00:47:04.160" style="s2">picking up a tablet and just boop</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.920" end="00:47:05.599" style="s2">it scans your face it knows who you are</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.160" end="00:47:06.800" style="s2">and then it says oh hey here&#39;s all your</p>

<p begin="00:47:06.800" end="00:47:10.720" style="s2">you just put it down grab like glasses</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.200" end="00:47:10.960" style="s2">or something and like it knows who you</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.720" end="00:47:12.560" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.960" end="00:47:14.480" style="s2">this whole system knows everything about</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.560" end="00:47:16.000" style="s2">you and it says like oh</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.480" end="00:47:17.599" style="s2">down the block there&#39;s somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.000" end="00:47:19.440" style="s2">that needs a new pair</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.599" end="00:47:20.640" style="s2">you can get point five service karma if</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.440" end="00:47:22.160" style="s2">you just give them</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.640" end="00:47:23.599" style="s2">one of these things oh cool sure no</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.160" end="00:47:24.880" style="s2">problem and then pick up some trash on</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.599" end="00:47:27.440" style="s2">the way there and you can get extra</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.880" end="00:47:30.400" style="s2">points great no problem</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.440" end="00:47:31.760" style="s2">right like having a system that makes it</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.400" end="00:47:34.800" style="s2">really easy</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.760" end="00:47:37.599" style="s2">to be a good person like that</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.800" end="00:47:38.400" style="s2">that&#39;s something that i&#39;m really like</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.599" end="00:47:41.200" style="s2">wishing</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.400" end="00:47:42.800" style="s2">the world to like wishing to exist in</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.200" end="00:47:44.000" style="s2">the world and that&#39;s something i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.800" end="00:47:46.640" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.000" end="00:47:48.240" style="s2">thinking about a lot so i i want to</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.640" end="00:47:49.200" style="s2">throw a little bit of a spanner into</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.240" end="00:47:51.280" style="s2">these works i mean i</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.200" end="00:47:53.520" style="s2">i too i&#39;ve got quite excited about all</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.280" end="00:47:56.160" style="s2">this but but something is starting to</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.520" end="00:47:57.200" style="s2">dawn on me is that who gets to decide</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.160" end="00:48:01.119" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.200" end="00:48:04.240" style="s2">is and is not a karma point-worthy act</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.119" end="00:48:06.480" style="s2">right exactly this is a real this is a</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.240" end="00:48:08.720" style="s2">potential real problem right</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.480" end="00:48:09.680" style="s2">yeah and i just wanted to throw that in</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.720" end="00:48:13.359" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.680" end="00:48:14.160" style="s2">and i working with ai i don&#39;t think it</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.359" end="00:48:17.680" style="s2">should be ai</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.160" end="00:48:19.280" style="s2">deciding what the incentive should be</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.680" end="00:48:20.640" style="s2">whoever does get to decide they wield a</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.280" end="00:48:21.920" style="s2">lot of power right the person who</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.640" end="00:48:23.839" style="s2">describes that</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.920" end="00:48:25.520" style="s2">they wield a lot of power over the</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.839" end="00:48:27.920" style="s2">behavior of society so</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.520" end="00:48:29.920" style="s2">it&#39;s a tricky one so i mean could be</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.920" end="00:48:33.520" style="s2">like a wisdom of the crowds thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.920" end="00:48:36.240" style="s2">where you like crowds force people</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.520" end="00:48:36.960" style="s2">deciding what behaviors to incentivize</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.240" end="00:48:40.319" style="s2">but then</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.960" end="00:48:43.520" style="s2">i mean you get weird popular behavior</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.319" end="00:48:47.119" style="s2">entertaining and all of that</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.520" end="00:48:50.000" style="s2">yeah yeah so well you probably do it</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.119" end="00:48:53.040" style="s2">more like the sam harris moral landscape</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.000" end="00:48:56.160" style="s2">type of thing where your system</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.040" end="00:48:59.520" style="s2">is not the same for all</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.160" end="00:49:01.280" style="s2">groups but you have a system where you</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.520" end="00:49:03.680" style="s2">kind of set the value</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.280" end="00:49:06.400" style="s2">parameters for your group and you say</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.680" end="00:49:09.280" style="s2">well i want to play inside this space</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.400" end="00:49:10.640" style="s2">right but you would find the landscape</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.280" end="00:49:12.480" style="s2">that works for you and so you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.640" end="00:49:14.160" style="s2">these different moral landscape</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.480" end="00:49:16.000" style="s2">peaks you know hopefully you aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.160" end="00:49:20.000" style="s2">signing up for one that&#39;s really really</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.000" end="00:49:23.040" style="s2">low um but</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.000" end="00:49:24.319" style="s2">like a meta crowd source they&#39;ll all be</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.040" end="00:49:27.280" style="s2">pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.319" end="00:49:28.880" style="s2">um because you know human nature is</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.280" end="00:49:31.280" style="s2">naturally pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.880" end="00:49:32.880" style="s2">and we&#39;re shooting for something higher</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.280" end="00:49:35.760" style="s2">but you wouldn&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.880" end="00:49:37.359" style="s2">value system that&#39;s ubiquitous for all</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.760" end="00:49:39.520" style="s2">the people using the system</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.359" end="00:49:41.280" style="s2">you&#39;d have to have a way to have</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.520" end="00:49:43.200" style="s2">different groups</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.280" end="00:49:44.400" style="s2">i like that although i have to say if we</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.200" end="00:49:45.760" style="s2">were starting with ten thousand hundred</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.400" end="00:49:48.240" style="s2">thousand dollars we&#39;d probably have one</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.760" end="00:49:50.240" style="s2">and then wrench you know from there but</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.240" end="00:49:51.839" style="s2">um we&#39;re getting close to the hour</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.240" end="00:49:53.119" style="s2">so if we want to wrap up this part and</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.839" end="00:49:55.040" style="s2">then we&#39;ll be switching over just to the</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.119" end="00:49:57.040" style="s2">last bit which is sharing our</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.040" end="00:49:58.400" style="s2">um most powerful one that we would like</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.040" end="00:49:59.599" style="s2">to see that you&#39;d want to be part of</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.400" end="00:50:01.920" style="s2">so you can get that in the back of your</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.599" end="00:50:03.599" style="s2">head we&#39;ll wrap up this part</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.920" end="00:50:07.040" style="s2">anyone has any thoughts left on this</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.599" end="00:50:07.040" style="s2">part before we can switch over that</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.640" end="00:50:12.880" style="s2">yeah i think 10 000 10 000 people and</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.200" end="00:50:13.440" style="s2">hundred thousand dollars is not enough</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.880" end="00:50:15.440" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.440" end="00:50:16.720" style="s2">pull off a system like this that can be</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.440" end="00:50:20.400" style="s2">adapted well but</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.720" end="00:50:24.319" style="s2">maybe um it can be enough</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.400" end="00:50:28.400" style="s2">to like</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.319" end="00:50:31.559" style="s2">inspire a good faith</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.400" end="00:50:34.800" style="s2">like game where people</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.559" end="00:50:37.520" style="s2">self-report what they do like you can</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.800" end="00:50:39.839" style="s2">say like hey guys we&#39;re doing this game</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.520" end="00:50:41.520" style="s2">we make a mighty networks about it or</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.839" end="00:50:44.960" style="s2">make some type of thing</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.520" end="00:50:48.559" style="s2">and everybody</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.960" end="00:50:48.559" style="s2">puts in what they&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.640" end="00:50:52.640" style="s2">that is different from what they</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.119" end="00:50:55.040" style="s2">normally do</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.640" end="00:50:56.800" style="s2">and then like other people vote and they</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.040" end="00:50:58.079" style="s2">say oh yeah i&#39;ll give you i&#39;ll give you</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.800" end="00:50:58.400" style="s2">a point for that all right i&#39;ll give you</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.079" end="00:51:00.480" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.400" end="00:51:01.839" style="s2">you know 10 points for that other people</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.480" end="00:51:05.040" style="s2">can just</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.839" end="00:51:07.680" style="s2">randomly arbitrarily assign points</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.040" end="00:51:08.559" style="s2">to people and like make them feel good</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.680" end="00:51:11.200" style="s2">that like</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.559" end="00:51:12.800" style="s2">oh i&#39;m i&#39;m being recognized for doing</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.200" end="00:51:14.640" style="s2">something that helps the world</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.800" end="00:51:23.839" style="s2">like we can just kind of jerry-rig</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.640" end="00:51:23.839" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.440" end="00:51:28.640" style="s2">in general um</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.000" end="00:51:34.000" style="s2">it&#39;s uh i think it could i think it</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.359" end="00:51:36.079" style="s2">could work</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.000" end="00:51:38.480" style="s2">i guess i like what was said the most</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.079" end="00:51:40.880" style="s2">about the cultural aspect</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.480" end="00:51:41.839" style="s2">and saying well we need these spaces</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.880" end="00:51:45.119" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.839" end="00:51:48.000" style="s2">uh people can be encouraged</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.119" end="00:51:49.920" style="s2">for behaviors that we like and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.000" end="00:51:50.400" style="s2">it&#39;s just my personal world that like i</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.920" end="00:51:54.160" style="s2">don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.400" end="00:51:56.720" style="s2">see a lot of that in my own world um</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.160" end="00:52:05.839" style="s2">but it&#39;s definitely needed if this is</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.720" end="00:52:05.839" style="s2">gonna work</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.480" end="00:52:09.359" style="s2">i thought that was the switch over to</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.000" end="00:52:10.480" style="s2">the other part does anyone else want to</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.359" end="00:52:12.319" style="s2">share what they um</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.480" end="00:52:13.599" style="s2">what their most powerful one is i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.319" end="00:52:15.440" style="s2">know if germans was that</p>

<p begin="00:53:00.160" end="00:53:07.760" style="s2">with limited resources and</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.920" end="00:53:07.760" style="s2">achievable and could have big impact</p>

<p begin="00:53:12.800" end="00:53:15.599" style="s2">break all the rules and say that because</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.640" end="00:53:16.640" style="s2">i was using that hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.599" end="00:53:19.040" style="s2">dollars in my head to create the</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.640" end="00:53:21.680" style="s2">platform to be able to run the contest</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.040" end="00:53:23.200" style="s2">so having a hundred groups of 100 all</p>

<p begin="00:53:23.200" end="00:53:26.079" style="s2">localized and you&#39;re competing against</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.800" end="00:53:27.760" style="s2">the other ones</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.079" end="00:53:29.520" style="s2">and we use the hundred thousand dollars</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.760" end="00:53:31.680" style="s2">to create the platform to make that work</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.520" end="00:53:33.680" style="s2">and then we have some kind of outside</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.680" end="00:53:34.800" style="s2">game a sponsor who puts in a million</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.680" end="00:53:36.640" style="s2">dollars or puts in something that</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.800" end="00:53:38.480" style="s2">actually maybe is a big prize</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.640" end="00:53:40.160" style="s2">that it or we&#39;re just doing it because</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.480" end="00:53:42.000" style="s2">it&#39;s fun right like you don&#39;t need to be</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.160" end="00:53:43.680" style="s2">paid to go play hockey or go</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.000" end="00:53:45.599" style="s2">do those things it&#39;s just like pay for</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.680" end="00:53:47.359" style="s2">bragging rights vancouver</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.599" end="00:53:49.040" style="s2">down the road sure you do it for karma</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.359" end="00:53:50.480" style="s2">points down the road but for right now i</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.040" end="00:53:52.000" style="s2">think waving dollar bills under people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.480" end="00:53:53.119" style="s2">noses is a pretty is a pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.000" end="00:53:54.800" style="s2">immediate incentive</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.119" end="00:53:57.119" style="s2">and i agree it&#39;s not one that we should</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.800" end="00:53:59.200" style="s2">be looking to perpetuate for very long</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.119" end="00:53:59.680" style="s2">but but however we&#39;d already have 10 000</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.200" end="00:54:01.119" style="s2">people right</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.680" end="00:54:04.079" style="s2">right now to get the ball rolling i</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.119" end="00:54:06.079" style="s2">think it&#39;s maybe maybe usable</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.079" end="00:54:07.599" style="s2">like we&#39;d be creating an assist a gaming</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.079" end="00:54:08.800" style="s2">something that was with the 10 000</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.599" end="00:54:10.400" style="s2">people so it&#39;d be like</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.800" end="00:54:12.160" style="s2">breaking off in a hundred groups of 100</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.400" end="00:54:13.359" style="s2">and then saying like if this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.160" end="00:54:15.040" style="s2">something you would participate in</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.359" end="00:54:16.400" style="s2">unless there&#39;s a million dollar prize</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.040" end="00:54:17.440" style="s2">then you wouldn&#39;t vote for that anyway</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.400" end="00:54:18.240" style="s2">so you wouldn&#39;t be part of the ten</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.440" end="00:54:21.280" style="s2">thousand</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.240" end="00:54:22.640" style="s2">so it&#39;s not you&#39;re in the five of us</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.280" end="00:54:23.599" style="s2">to build the platform you&#39;re the one</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.640" end="00:54:25.040" style="s2">that&#39;s taking the hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.599" end="00:54:26.720" style="s2">dollars away to build the platform i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.040" end="00:54:29.760" style="s2">talking about using that</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.720" end="00:54:30.960" style="s2">as price money yeah no it should be cool</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.760" end="00:54:32.319" style="s2">because a hundred thousand would be a</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.960" end="00:54:33.440" style="s2">thousand right so each person gets a</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.319" end="00:54:34.720" style="s2">thousand and that&#39;s enough of an</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.440" end="00:54:37.200" style="s2">incentive for most people</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.720" end="00:54:39.359" style="s2">to be like yeah i&#39;m gonna win that one i</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.200" end="00:54:39.760" style="s2">mean are there any platforms that you</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.359" end="00:54:43.760" style="s2">could</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.760" end="00:54:45.680" style="s2">already use that that comes to mind like</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.760" end="00:54:46.880" style="s2">if you want to use the money as prize</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.680" end="00:54:48.960" style="s2">money</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.880" end="00:54:51.280" style="s2">are there any platforms that are good</p>

<p begin="00:54:53.440" end="00:54:58.720" style="s2">maybe instead of karma points you use</p>
