<p begin="00:00:43.530" end="00:00:47.760" style="s2">doing this possibility during the</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.910" end="00:00:49.829" style="s2">pandemic I feel like I&#39;ve had a fairly</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.760" end="00:00:52.800" style="s2">good 24 hours I talked to Jordan hall</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.829" end="00:00:56.250" style="s2">yesterday which was exactly what I</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.800" end="00:00:57.780" style="s2">needed both will get too much into it</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.250" end="00:01:01.440" style="s2">it&#39;s on the youtube channel you can</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.780" end="00:01:05.040" style="s2">watch the whole thing but I feel more</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.440" end="00:01:07.590" style="s2">empowered in my mission to bring the</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.040" end="00:01:09.119" style="s2">global tech solutions cooperative to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.590" end="00:01:11.790" style="s2">world that that is exactly what the</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.119" end="00:01:13.350" style="s2">world needs right now and how we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.790" end="00:01:17.250" style="s2">doing that is through solution raising</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.350" end="00:01:19.290" style="s2">so is this all about I&#39;m creating a well</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.250" end="00:01:21.810" style="s2">we are creating a tech cooperative so</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.290" end="00:01:23.220" style="s2">that we can create the infrastructure to</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.810" end="00:01:24.600" style="s2">be able to come together on a massive</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.220" end="00:01:26.430" style="s2">scale this was we were doing this before</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.600" end="00:01:27.600" style="s2">Cove in nineteen but now that everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.430" end="00:01:32.040" style="s2">stuck inside it gives us an opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.600" end="00:01:35.189" style="s2">to reach more people have more people</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.040" end="00:01:38.820" style="s2">join because although tech is something</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.189" end="00:01:40.710" style="s2">that only a talented group it takes it</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.820" end="00:01:42.930" style="s2">takes education it takes knowledge know</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.710" end="00:01:44.790" style="s2">how to build the tech but everyone can</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.930" end="00:01:47.670" style="s2">have a say in what we want that tech to</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.790" end="00:01:49.979" style="s2">look like what we want our version of</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.670" end="00:01:51.930" style="s2">Facebook to look like if we had a social</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.979" end="00:01:55.140" style="s2">media platform that was designed for us</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.930" end="00:01:57.030" style="s2">to come together for Kovan 19 what would</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.140" end="00:01:59.340" style="s2">that look like if we knew this pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.030" end="00:02:01.110" style="s2">was happening a year from now what would</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.340" end="00:02:02.969" style="s2">we be putting in place so that we could</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.110" end="00:02:04.409" style="s2">better help with our mental and</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.969" end="00:02:06.509" style="s2">emotional health right now better</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.409" end="00:02:08.690" style="s2">coordinate that we know our food systems</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.509" end="00:02:11.280" style="s2">are going to continue better coordinate</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.690" end="00:02:14.390" style="s2">experts being able to share information</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.280" end="00:02:16.230" style="s2">with one another so that this thing gets</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.390" end="00:02:18.629" style="s2">dealt with with the best information</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.230" end="00:02:20.099" style="s2">possible how what would we want our</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.629" end="00:02:22.439" style="s2">politicians to be doing and how would we</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.099" end="00:02:25.620" style="s2">be holding them accountable what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.439" end="00:02:30.030" style="s2">technology could we create and so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.620" end="00:02:32.010" style="s2">been speaking about it for a while what</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.030" end="00:02:35.060" style="s2">the power of a tech cooperative without</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.010" end="00:02:37.620" style="s2">feeling like I&#39;ve been giving it the</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.060" end="00:02:39.540" style="s2">communication it deserves because people</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.620" end="00:02:42.209" style="s2">here Tech and they glaze over it is like</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.540" end="00:02:45.180" style="s2">I don&#39;t know text text the enemy not not</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.209" end="00:02:47.340" style="s2">the solution and so I did a video series</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.180" end="00:02:48.540" style="s2">in December called together tech it&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.340" end="00:02:49.829" style="s2">this channel and then we have our own</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.540" end="00:02:51.299" style="s2">channel together Tech where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.829" end="00:02:54.030" style="s2">actually building the cooperative we</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.299" end="00:02:56.730" style="s2">have our live board meeting live median</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.030" end="00:02:58.500" style="s2">staffing and just three over three and a</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.730" end="00:03:00.989" style="s2">half hours I&#39;m doing this every day</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.500" end="00:03:06.590" style="s2">coming on from 8:30 to 9:30 nine time</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.989" end="00:03:11.159" style="s2">Pacific Standard Time to work on</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.590" end="00:03:15.120" style="s2">creating the solution raising part of</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.159" end="00:03:17.819" style="s2">the tech cooperative together so over</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.120" end="00:03:20.190" style="s2">the last two months we&#39;ve been hosting</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.819" end="00:03:22.409" style="s2">solution reasons we&#39;ve done them on six</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.190" end="00:03:25.400" style="s2">different topics a solution raising is</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.409" end="00:03:28.049" style="s2">simply an hour-long conversation that</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.400" end="00:03:30.629" style="s2">generates potential solutions that we</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.049" end="00:03:35.669" style="s2">could actually implement right now if we</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.629" end="00:03:37.079" style="s2">had 10,000 people and $100,000 and lived</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.669" end="00:03:38.970" style="s2">in the world we currently live in so we</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.079" end="00:03:40.650" style="s2">can&#39;t necessarily pass laws we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.970" end="00:03:43.019" style="s2">necessarily enforce our views on other</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.650" end="00:03:45.090" style="s2">people nor should we be able to but we</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.019" end="00:03:47.009" style="s2">can create a solution for the 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.090" end="00:03:48.090" style="s2">people who want that solution and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.009" end="00:03:51.470" style="s2">after talking to Jordan Holly yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.090" end="00:03:54.840" style="s2">and he&#39;d get him giving me his advice on</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.470" end="00:03:56.099" style="s2">what that would look like and I will be</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.840" end="00:04:01.109" style="s2">sitting with that for the next few days</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.099" end="00:04:02.819" style="s2">two weeks and figuring out Cogan</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.109" end="00:04:05.909" style="s2">individual on a community level well we</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.819" end="00:04:07.379" style="s2">right now it&#39;s hard to do because who</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.909" end="00:04:10.439" style="s2">would need to do that as Google in our</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.379" end="00:04:13.500" style="s2">governments and we are seeing what the</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.439" end="00:04:16.199" style="s2">lack of trust in those institutions is</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.500" end="00:04:19.049" style="s2">costing us all there&#39;s both correct</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.199" end="00:04:20.820" style="s2">information that were not listening to</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.049" end="00:04:22.409" style="s2">and false information that we are</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.820" end="00:04:25.169" style="s2">listening to and who knows which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.409" end="00:04:27.570" style="s2">which who knows our governments are the</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.169" end="00:04:29.310" style="s2">best we have right now to deal with us</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.570" end="00:04:31.590" style="s2">and they are in no way adequate to deal</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.310" end="00:04:33.330" style="s2">with it so if we had a technology</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.590" end="00:04:35.640" style="s2">cooperative that we owned together that</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.330" end="00:04:37.050" style="s2">was our version of Google then we could</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.640" end="00:04:39.240" style="s2">have designed it in a way but we felt</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.050" end="00:04:41.040" style="s2">comfortable giving our data so as soon</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.240" end="00:04:42.420" style="s2">as this hit we could be taking our</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.040" end="00:04:46.290" style="s2">temperature every day and putting it</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.420" end="00:04:48.030" style="s2">into a database we could be coming up</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.290" end="00:04:50.130" style="s2">with our own tests for hope at 19 and</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.030" end="00:04:51.750" style="s2">would it be as great is what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.130" end="00:04:54.390" style="s2">trying to come up with maybe not but it</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.750" end="00:04:56.870" style="s2">would be something we could be sharing</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.390" end="00:05:04.830" style="s2">that information so that next year</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.870" end="00:05:06.930" style="s2">sharing that information I have a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.830" end="00:05:11.190" style="s2">a mess here but you know the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.930" end="00:05:13.710" style="s2">I click on the link on your YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.190" end="00:05:23.730" style="s2">video and YouTube videos still playing</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.710" end="00:05:37.740" style="s2">so I hear kind of an echo with the group</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.730" end="00:05:39.000" style="s2">of people I&#39;ll have it open yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.740" end="00:05:40.620" style="s2">looks like it&#39;s a gorgeous place to go</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.000" end="00:05:42.570" style="s2">for a walk it&#39;s not like another single</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.620" end="00:05:46.460" style="s2">human being I mean I think I can hear</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.570" end="00:05:50.280" style="s2">your kin so or no are you with your kid</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.460" end="00:05:53.670" style="s2">maybe it was me the YouTube I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.280" end="00:06:11.820" style="s2">how oh yeah you know available because</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.670" end="00:06:14.670" style="s2">he might start crying anyway hi someone</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.820" end="00:06:16.650" style="s2">had asked M HR had asked what do we have</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.670" end="00:06:18.360" style="s2">any ideas which policy that China</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.650" end="00:06:22.410" style="s2">followed what are your thoughts like</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.360" end="00:06:24.360" style="s2">right now with or authoritarian</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.410" end="00:06:28.020" style="s2">government</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.360" end="00:06:29.880" style="s2">Korean governments and what the</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.020" end="00:06:34.230" style="s2">potential is with both of those and</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.880" end="00:06:38.310" style="s2">could we have a option that gave us the</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.230" end="00:06:41.280" style="s2">best of both worlds interesting question</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.310" end="00:06:45.210" style="s2">I mean politics is a hard topic for me</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.280" end="00:06:49.940" style="s2">I tend to avoid it I don&#39;t know maybe me</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.210" end="00:06:49.940" style="s2">like many others have political PTSD</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.180" end="00:06:56.460" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to find the safe space be</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.750" end="00:06:59.580" style="s2">able to talk about it without hurting</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.460" end="00:07:01.910" style="s2">anyone&#39;s feelings but I don&#39;t know as a</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.580" end="00:07:05.880" style="s2">Swiss person I have a bias for</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.910" end="00:07:09.480" style="s2">decentralization which is the way I mean</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.880" end="00:07:12.900" style="s2">we have like our central government</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.480" end="00:07:15.330" style="s2">decides a few things but our so-called</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.900" end="00:07:17.280" style="s2">Canton&#39;s I don&#39;t know how you would call</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.330" end="00:07:21.770" style="s2">them maybe counties or something have a</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.280" end="00:07:24.480" style="s2">lot of power legislative powers and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.770" end="00:07:27.120" style="s2">we have we see many experiments at the</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.480" end="00:07:30.780" style="s2">local level and then the ones that work</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.120" end="00:07:34.260" style="s2">well get adopted at the federal level</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.780" end="00:07:38.960" style="s2">and so I think there is power in that</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.260" end="00:07:41.250" style="s2">approach it&#39;s kind of like Nassim Taleb</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.960" end="00:07:43.500" style="s2">uses Switzerland as an example for</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.250" end="00:07:45.240" style="s2">antifragility right because because of</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.500" end="00:07:50.760" style="s2">that because you can do experiments and</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.240" end="00:07:53.490" style="s2">some of them will fail in central</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.760" end="00:07:57.030" style="s2">authority is that the central authority</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.490" end="00:07:59.940" style="s2">needs to make the right decisions if</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.030" end="00:08:02.610" style="s2">they do then it&#39;s very efficient if they</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.940" end="00:08:04.680" style="s2">don&#39;t then I mean basically that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.610" end="00:08:06.600" style="s2">problem right with fragility right if</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.680" end="00:08:10.169" style="s2">you have a benevolent king that is super</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.600" end="00:08:12.990" style="s2">smart and that&#39;s the best government you</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.169" end="00:08:15.360" style="s2">can have that&#39;s the fragility right if</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.990" end="00:08:21.360" style="s2">that person becomes mad then you have a</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.360" end="00:08:23.039" style="s2">problem who don&#39;t want any King in</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.360" end="00:08:24.960" style="s2">charge of us and even if the King is</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.039" end="00:08:27.479" style="s2">enough planting Pines and does the exact</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.960" end="00:08:30.450" style="s2">right thing we want to do the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.479" end="00:08:33.060" style="s2">because we have oppositional disorder</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.450" end="00:08:37.110" style="s2">stay inside I&#39;ll show you inside where</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.060" end="00:08:38.849" style="s2">is it we ask Jordan Peterson kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.110" end="00:08:42.990" style="s2">questions like who follows the king</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.849" end="00:08:46.200" style="s2">right when the King dies okay yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.990" end="00:08:48.330" style="s2">absolutely it&#39;s true 270 conversation on</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.200" end="00:08:50.250" style="s2">how like Harvard and Yale and mie I</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.330" end="00:08:53.430" style="s2">don&#39;t know maybe a mighty still has its</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.250" end="00:08:54.980" style="s2">clout but you know a generation ago it</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.430" end="00:08:56.930" style="s2">was the top people who went there</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.980" end="00:08:58.370" style="s2">now although it was always the case now</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.930" end="00:09:00.139" style="s2">it&#39;s even more so that it&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.370" end="00:09:02.300" style="s2">the alumni of people who are successful</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.139" end="00:09:03.889" style="s2">the last generation like it&#39;s like that</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.300" end="00:09:05.449" style="s2">your parents were successful doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.889" end="00:09:07.310" style="s2">actually mean you&#39;re successful and you</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.449" end="00:09:12.529" style="s2">paid for your place and it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.310" end="00:09:16.070" style="s2">with with King succession right if we</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.529" end="00:09:18.470" style="s2">are raised in to royalty and you that</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.070" end="00:09:19.910" style="s2">can be a positive at can you can get all</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.470" end="00:09:21.709" style="s2">the leadership skills that you need in</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.910" end="00:09:26.750" style="s2">order to be able to do that but chances</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.709" end="00:09:28.579" style="s2">are you didn&#39;t happen to be everything</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.750" end="00:09:32.510" style="s2">you need to be to be a good benevolent</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.579" end="00:09:37.220" style="s2">leader yeah I don&#39;t know my sense is</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.510" end="00:09:39.320" style="s2">like I have a very you know rough idea</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.220" end="00:09:42.740" style="s2">of what good politics are is yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.320" end="00:09:46.339" style="s2">just I my biases towards again like an</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.740" end="00:09:48.699" style="s2">individual action etc which is not to</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.339" end="00:09:51.440" style="s2">say that it&#39;s always the right approach</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.699" end="00:09:53.870" style="s2">it&#39;s just the way my brain works right</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.440" end="00:09:55.639" style="s2">like for example I I I keep thinking</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.870" end="00:09:59.600" style="s2">about Wikipedia right Wikipedia now</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.639" end="00:10:02.240" style="s2">nobody would think of funding like</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.600" end="00:10:04.639" style="s2">asking governments to provide an</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.240" end="00:10:06.470" style="s2">encyclopedia you know like it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.639" end="00:10:08.870" style="s2">joke right now we have Wikipedia we</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.470" end="00:10:10.519" style="s2">don&#39;t need any government to do that</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.870" end="00:10:12.079" style="s2">so that&#39;s kind of my kind of bias right</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.519" end="00:10:17.180" style="s2">let&#39;s try to find the solutions that</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.079" end="00:10:19.550" style="s2">made a centralized solution obsolete you</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.180" end="00:10:22.160" style="s2">probably have a similar bias yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.550" end="00:10:24.680" style="s2">like and this is where we&#39;re seeing for</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.160" end="00:10:26.300" style="s2">wind Koba 19 hit China they were able to</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.680" end="00:10:28.490" style="s2">deal with it in a much more efficient</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.300" end="00:10:32.389" style="s2">manner than Canada in America in</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.490" end="00:10:34.279" style="s2">Australia but I don&#39;t want that</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.389" end="00:10:35.600" style="s2">efficiency like I don&#39;t want to give up</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.279" end="00:10:38.420" style="s2">what I wouldn&#39;t give up to get that</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.600" end="00:10:39.649" style="s2">efficiency and at the same it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.420" end="00:10:41.319" style="s2">more and more clear that there is this</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.649" end="00:10:51.079" style="s2">trade-off between efficiency and</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.319" end="00:10:53.269" style="s2">resilience right I wanted to ask you</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.079" end="00:10:59.949" style="s2">another thing that&#39;s not exactly related</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.269" end="00:11:03.949" style="s2">but in your talks with people did you</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.949" end="00:11:05.959" style="s2">talk about what kind of application or</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.949" end="00:11:07.699" style="s2">technology could be helpful right now</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.959" end="00:11:08.930" style="s2">like something that could be built</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.699" end="00:11:11.120" style="s2">within a few days</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.930" end="00:11:14.690" style="s2">or so you know I&#39;m asking as a weather</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.120" end="00:11:16.730" style="s2">engineer which is kind of part of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.690" end="00:11:18.710" style="s2">issue I find is someone who&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.730" end="00:11:20.990" style="s2">likes tech thinks tech can save the</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.710" end="00:11:23.300" style="s2">world but isn&#39;t no way tech a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.990" end="00:11:25.040" style="s2">of a technophobe is that a one I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.300" end="00:11:26.990" style="s2">necessarily know what&#39;s easy to code</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.040" end="00:11:31.670" style="s2">right but I have an idea that if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.990" end="00:11:33.140" style="s2">one or two three word features in it</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.670" end="00:11:34.970" style="s2">it&#39;s probably easier to code then of</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.140" end="00:11:37.520" style="s2">course like dozens of features that I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.970" end="00:11:39.770" style="s2">have to interpret but and that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.520" end="00:11:43.220" style="s2">the question where if we knew this</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.770" end="00:11:44.930" style="s2">company miracle now what would we want</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.220" end="00:11:46.610" style="s2">to have in place and I think those</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.930" end="00:11:48.050" style="s2">things the things that take six months</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.610" end="00:11:49.459" style="s2">to build the things that take a year to</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.050" end="00:11:50.870" style="s2">build are actually the more powerful</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.459" end="00:11:53.480" style="s2">ones they might they won&#39;t help</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.870" end="00:11:56.510" style="s2">necessarily with hope in nineteen but</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.480" end="00:11:58.130" style="s2">this is our baby apocalypse like as much</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.510" end="00:11:59.570" style="s2">as it&#39;s not going to be a baby in many</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.130" end="00:12:03.500" style="s2">many many countries we&#39;re going to see</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.570" end="00:12:05.600" style="s2">mass devastation it&#39;s kinder than</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.500" end="00:12:06.950" style="s2">climate change and it&#39;s literally doing</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.600" end="00:12:09.950" style="s2">the exact same thing the poor more</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.950" end="00:12:11.930" style="s2">affected foreign countries and the poor</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.950" end="00:12:14.080" style="s2">countries are more affected like what</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.930" end="00:12:16.430" style="s2">would we want to have had in place if we</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.080" end="00:12:19.310" style="s2">knew this was going to happen in a year</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.430" end="00:12:22.130" style="s2">and then start creating those things for</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.310" end="00:12:34.970" style="s2">the next I&#39;m sorry I have to interrupt I</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.130" end="00:12:36.430" style="s2">have to leave right now so if anyone</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.970" end="00:12:40.760" style="s2">wants to come and join me on camera</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.430" end="00:12:42.740" style="s2">again the link is in the description in</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.760" end="00:12:45.020" style="s2">YouTube and on periscope you&#39;d have to</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.740" end="00:12:47.450" style="s2">go to my Twitter and follow the comments</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.020" end="00:12:49.640" style="s2">I commented on this stream and that</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.450" end="00:12:52.670" style="s2">comment is the link to come and to come</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.640" end="00:12:55.579" style="s2">and join on camera but you can think</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.670" end="00:12:58.820" style="s2">about what would if you had the option</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.579" end="00:13:02.270" style="s2">of giving your data into a data pool</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.820" end="00:13:03.620" style="s2">that we could use to know how where this</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.270" end="00:13:06.980" style="s2">is spreading and how and how much</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.620" end="00:13:09.770" style="s2">whether your genetics makes you more</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.980" end="00:13:11.420" style="s2">susceptible to it whether you&#39;re what</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.770" end="00:13:12.980" style="s2">you&#39;re eating and what you&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.420" end="00:13:15.170" style="s2">prevention is going to actually help</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.980" end="00:13:16.790" style="s2">prevent it because you don&#39;t you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.170" end="00:13:19.130" style="s2">know unless you&#39;re part of a population</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.790" end="00:13:21.140" style="s2">you could do everything right and still</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.130" end="00:13:21.889" style="s2">get sick and you could do everything</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.140" end="00:13:24.109" style="s2">wrong and not get</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.889" end="00:13:25.790" style="s2">that cannot and and not and you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.109" end="00:13:27.410" style="s2">going to know that the things you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.790" end="00:13:29.660" style="s2">doing or helping or not unless it&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.410" end="00:13:35.420" style="s2">of the population or you can see what it</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.660" end="00:13:39.889" style="s2">is and so places like China can demand</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.420" end="00:13:43.549" style="s2">your information Google can&#39;t they might</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.889" end="00:13:46.369" style="s2">under this because of the the UM what is</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.549" end="00:13:48.319" style="s2">the word the direness of the situation</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.369" end="00:13:50.269" style="s2">might be able to do things they wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.319" end="00:13:52.189" style="s2">be able to do in a normal in normal</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.269" end="00:13:54.559" style="s2">times but we&#39;re still not gonna feel</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.189" end="00:13:56.149" style="s2">great about it if because google has our</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.559" end="00:13:58.549" style="s2">phones they actually have you can see</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.149" end="00:14:01.009" style="s2">information that is coming out that is</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.549" end="00:14:02.389" style="s2">more washed data like look we can see</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.009" end="00:14:04.040" style="s2">that everyone&#39;s still traveling we can</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.389" end="00:14:06.470" style="s2">see who&#39;s doing social distancing who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.040" end="00:14:09.169" style="s2">not doing social distancing in counties</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.470" end="00:14:10.910" style="s2">in in states because of course it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.169" end="00:14:14.839" style="s2">American that the data there they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.910" end="00:14:17.329" style="s2">showcasing in the media and there was I</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.839" end="00:14:19.970" style="s2">remember two weeks ago there was a map</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.329" end="00:14:21.589" style="s2">of there&#39;s a smart thermometer and they</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.970" end="00:14:23.299" style="s2">get the data back and so they were they</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.589" end="00:14:25.129" style="s2">can actually see when there&#39;s about to</p>

<p begin="00:14:28.399" end="00:14:32.629" style="s2">our bodies and Florida was red it was</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.980" end="00:14:34.129" style="s2">during spring break in Florida was red</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.629" end="00:14:37.399" style="s2">and the rest of the country wasn&#39;t and</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.129" end="00:14:40.549" style="s2">we&#39;re I mean seeing what else is is</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.399" end="00:14:42.470" style="s2">going on if we had access to that type</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.549" end="00:14:45.559" style="s2">of information so that we could better</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.470" end="00:14:47.389" style="s2">like what&#39;s the word we had our</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.559" end="00:14:49.100" style="s2">infectious disease solution raising and</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.389" end="00:14:50.689" style="s2">part of what we had come up with that we</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.100" end="00:14:52.100" style="s2">could do a ten thousand people and a</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.689" end="00:14:53.569" style="s2">hundred thousand dollars and that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.100" end="00:14:54.799" style="s2">might be a little far-fetched because</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.569" end="00:14:56.689" style="s2">how do those knows it&#39;s back to that</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.799" end="00:14:58.759" style="s2">much money to great now but to be able</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.689" end="00:15:00.949" style="s2">to use existing technology like Google</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.759" end="00:15:02.540" style="s2">Maps like our cell phones in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.949" end="00:15:05.989" style="s2">we feel safe in a way that&#39;s safe enough</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.540" end="00:15:07.579" style="s2">and be able to to share in that data so</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.989" end="00:15:09.860" style="s2">that if you were doing something like</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.579" end="00:15:11.779" style="s2">taking zinc or melatonin or vitamin C is</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.860" end="00:15:14.360" style="s2">that going to help you have a better</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.779" end="00:15:16.730" style="s2">outcome if you get this are you if</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.360" end="00:15:20.660" style="s2">you&#39;re it&#39;s really hard to know who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.730" end="00:15:23.059" style="s2">asymptomatic and has this but when you</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.660" end="00:15:24.919" style="s2">get it and you get a positive test</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.059" end="00:15:27.859" style="s2">what was your information over the last</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.919" end="00:15:29.449" style="s2">two weeks three weeks where do we think</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.859" end="00:15:30.619" style="s2">you got it from and we can see</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.449" end="00:15:32.389" style="s2">everywhere you&#39;ve been and it could</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.619" end="00:15:34.220" style="s2">paint everybody&#39;s phone who&#39;s also been</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.389" end="00:15:35.000" style="s2">in those locations and during that exact</p>

<p begin="00:15:35.000" end="00:15:38.270" style="s2">because it doesn&#39;t hang out in the air</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.140" end="00:15:40.850" style="s2">for very long so you don&#39;t need like</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.270" end="00:15:42.080" style="s2">right now there&#39;s this heightened first</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.850" end="00:15:43.760" style="s2">of all everywhere so you can&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.080" end="00:15:45.260" style="s2">track who has it who doesn&#39;t have it</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.760" end="00:15:49.040" style="s2">like it&#39;s just not really that helpful</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.260" end="00:15:50.300" style="s2">now to track when you there&#39;s a positive</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.040" end="00:15:53.060" style="s2">case everyone they&#39;ve come in contact</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.300" end="00:15:54.110" style="s2">with because really I just saw a post</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.060" end="00:15:55.850" style="s2">yesterday I was like yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.110" end="00:15:59.810" style="s2">accurately explains it that this is</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.850" end="00:16:02.680" style="s2">shorting jurors virus and if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.810" end="00:16:04.700" style="s2">know Chargers cat there&#39;s this famous</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.680" end="00:16:07.760" style="s2">experiments the wrong word and I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.700" end="00:16:09.170" style="s2">gonna butcher it but that the box with a</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.760" end="00:16:10.640" style="s2">cat in it you don&#39;t know the cat is</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.170" end="00:16:12.260" style="s2">alive or dead and so because you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.640" end="00:16:15.020" style="s2">know until you&#39;ve actually observed it</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.260" end="00:16:15.470" style="s2">you the cat is simultaneously alive and</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.020" end="00:16:18.680" style="s2">dead</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.470" end="00:16:22.790" style="s2">and physicists would would really scoff</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.680" end="00:16:25.520" style="s2">at that explanation but whatever that we</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.790" end="00:16:27.260" style="s2">all simultaneously have the virus we</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.520" end="00:16:29.000" style="s2">have to treat ourselves like we have it</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.260" end="00:16:30.920" style="s2">to protect the rest of the world right</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.000" end="00:16:32.090" style="s2">we have to like hopefully wear masks</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.920" end="00:16:33.350" style="s2">when they go out so if we&#39;re coffee and</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.090" end="00:16:35.390" style="s2">we&#39;re sneezing or just breathing and</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.350" end="00:16:36.740" style="s2">we&#39;re one of these symptomatic people or</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.390" end="00:16:38.930" style="s2">one of the people what&#39;s incubating for</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.740" end="00:16:41.720" style="s2">14 days we don&#39;t spread it to other</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.930" end="00:16:43.790" style="s2">people and we simultaneously have to</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.720" end="00:16:45.890" style="s2">think we&#39;ve never had the virus we have</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.790" end="00:16:49.970" style="s2">a build of antibodies to not come in</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.890" end="00:16:51.260" style="s2">contact with it and keep ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.970" end="00:16:53.030" style="s2">everyone else safe and so we</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.260" end="00:16:55.460" style="s2">simultaneously it&#39;s like shorteners</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.030" end="00:16:56.750" style="s2">virus we have the virus we have to</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.460" end="00:16:59.630" style="s2">assume we both have it and have never</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.750" end="00:17:01.520" style="s2">had it had it and that is I mean any</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.630" end="00:17:04.490" style="s2">kind of information on an infectious</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.520" end="00:17:06.530" style="s2">disease could be helped with data and</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.490" end="00:17:08.240" style="s2">can be helped with being able to have</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.530" end="00:17:10.820" style="s2">and we are seeing scientists doing this</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.240" end="00:17:12.500" style="s2">for this in a way they haven&#39;t for other</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.820" end="00:17:14.390" style="s2">things but they are coordinating on a</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.500" end="00:17:16.820" style="s2">different level where this isn&#39;t about</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.390" end="00:17:18.620" style="s2">for profit it&#39;s about can we get this</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.820" end="00:17:21.290" style="s2">vaccine made can we get treatments</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.620" end="00:17:23.209" style="s2">passed through and you still have</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.290" end="00:17:24.980" style="s2">everyone playing gaming as well so you</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.209" end="00:17:27.500" style="s2">have some people there&#39;s a company</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.980" end="00:17:29.570" style="s2">called Gilead like I&#39;m like did you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.500" end="00:17:31.430" style="s2">what that was did you name it after</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.570" end="00:17:34.280" style="s2">Handmaid&#39;s Tale because that seems like</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.430" end="00:17:35.750" style="s2">a problematic name but anyway I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.280" end="00:17:38.420" style="s2">know why Gilead it&#39;s called Gillian ad</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.750" end="00:17:41.750" style="s2">maids tale it&#39;s probably based on the</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.420" end="00:17:44.600" style="s2">same thing but they&#39;re they have an</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.750" end="00:17:48.110" style="s2">orphan drug and an orphan drug is a drug</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.600" end="00:17:48.440" style="s2">that from what I understand because the</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.110" end="00:17:54.590" style="s2">toy</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.440" end="00:17:55.519" style="s2">a population of people in distributing</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.590" end="00:17:58.940" style="s2">areas I don&#39;t know what you mean by</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.519" end="00:18:01.009" style="s2">disposable devices sorry can we have</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.940" end="00:18:02.600" style="s2">disposable devices in these days is that</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.009" end="00:18:06.169" style="s2">could help us that we can distribute in</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.600" end="00:18:08.120" style="s2">areas distribute what into you mean like</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.169" end="00:18:11.120" style="s2">disposable food that we could like drop</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.120" end="00:18:12.740" style="s2">into places so they can eat or medical</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.120" end="00:18:16.070" style="s2">supplies I mean although medical</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.740" end="00:18:17.450" style="s2">supplies are basically disposable maybe</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.070" end="00:18:19.100" style="s2">not the respirators but all the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.450" end="00:18:20.450" style="s2">that&#39;s connected and gets thrown out and</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.100" end="00:18:22.309" style="s2">used for next not used for the next</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.450" end="00:18:26.570" style="s2">person generally that&#39;s what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.309" end="00:18:30.350" style="s2">seeing now is Londoners health I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.570" end="00:18:32.440" style="s2">know why I mean maybe to find out I mean</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.350" end="00:18:34.549" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s also part of what any</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.440" end="00:18:36.620" style="s2">solution that&#39;s happens under gaming</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.549" end="00:18:38.659" style="s2">under capitalism in a for-profit model</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.620" end="00:18:40.399" style="s2">is although we have a ton of Fitbit</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.659" end="00:18:42.289" style="s2">information we only have fit but</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.399" end="00:18:44.419" style="s2">information from fairly wealthy</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.289" end="00:18:46.370" style="s2">individuals right like I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.419" end="00:18:48.049" style="s2">it I did it would be a knockoff for sure</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.370" end="00:18:52.730" style="s2">so it&#39;s not going to concentrate it in</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.049" end="00:18:55.129" style="s2">one pool part of it is that we as a</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.730" end="00:18:56.360" style="s2">society benefit from people wearing that</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.129" end="00:18:57.889" style="s2">and putting their data back into the</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.360" end="00:18:59.629" style="s2">system and the individual benefits from</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.889" end="00:19:02.419" style="s2">having their own individual data and</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.629" end="00:19:04.909" style="s2">there&#39;s you know an actual cost to</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.419" end="00:19:07.399" style="s2">making that device but all of the profit</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.909" end="00:19:08.990" style="s2">that&#39;s involved makes it astronomically</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.399" end="00:19:10.759" style="s2">expensive if we could produce them at</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.990" end="00:19:12.320" style="s2">cost and make them available at cost and</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.759" end="00:19:15.019" style="s2">possibly make them available at cost</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.320" end="00:19:16.460" style="s2">like a Tom&#39;s type model where if I buy</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.019" end="00:19:17.990" style="s2">one and it&#39;s fifty bucks it actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.460" end="00:19:21.080" style="s2">buys two of them and it goes to somebody</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.990" end="00:19:22.370" style="s2">else who truly can&#39;t afford one and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.080" end="00:19:24.019" style="s2">we have more of the information there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.370" end="00:19:26.450" style="s2">time there&#39;s ton of stuff that keeps</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.019" end="00:19:27.830" style="s2">coming out that are our devices that we</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.450" end="00:19:29.779" style="s2">can measure stuff on because your blood</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.830" end="00:19:31.009" style="s2">pressure you can measure remember there</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.779" end="00:19:32.360" style="s2">was one on kick-started that I really</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.009" end="00:19:34.100" style="s2">wanted and I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s still in</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.360" end="00:19:36.940" style="s2">existence which is another problem is</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.100" end="00:19:39.320" style="s2">these things come and go and they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.940" end="00:19:41.330" style="s2">stay in the marketplace because there</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.320" end="00:19:46.669" style="s2">isn&#39;t enough of the market in order to</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.330" end="00:19:48.379" style="s2">keep them anyway the one that you</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.669" end="00:19:50.929" style="s2">breathe it into and it would tell you</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.379" end="00:19:52.490" style="s2">whether you were digesting your food</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.929" end="00:19:53.870" style="s2">properly so it would tell you what you</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.490" end="00:19:55.309" style="s2">liked it would tell you if you&#39;re gluten</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.870" end="00:19:56.659" style="s2">intolerant if you&#39;re a dairy intolerant</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.309" end="00:19:58.460" style="s2">all of all of this information I had</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.659" end="00:19:59.720" style="s2">five or six things that it would it</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.460" end="00:20:00.860" style="s2">would measure her but still it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.720" end="00:20:02.090" style="s2">kind of thing like am I gonna buy three</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.860" end="00:20:04.250" style="s2">hundred dollar device to find that</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.090" end="00:20:05.960" style="s2">one time like it&#39;s like those are the</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.250" end="00:20:07.549" style="s2">kind of things where I want access to it</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.960" end="00:20:08.809" style="s2">in a safe way where it&#39;s not the same</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.549" end="00:20:10.490" style="s2">thing going my mouth is in your mouth</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.809" end="00:20:12.289" style="s2">but like at the same time we can share</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.490" end="00:20:16.700" style="s2">that like I don&#39;t know why we all all</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.289" end="00:20:20.210" style="s2">need to have one of those but an orphan</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.700" end="00:20:23.419" style="s2">drug is a drug that is for a population</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.210" end="00:20:25.730" style="s2">of under 200,000 and I believe the idea</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.419" end="00:20:27.799" style="s2">is unlike other drugs which go through a</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.730" end="00:20:29.450" style="s2">period of being patent protected that</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.799" end="00:20:32.120" style="s2">you can be the only one selling them and</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.450" end="00:20:34.220" style="s2">then they except patent expires and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.120" end="00:20:36.919" style="s2">anyone can make the drug generic so it</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.220" end="00:20:39.350" style="s2">can be you know made on mass for a lot</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.919" end="00:20:43.370" style="s2">cheaper because people aren&#39;t making it</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.350" end="00:20:45.409" style="s2">for profit if you are it&#39;s there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.370" end="00:20:47.539" style="s2">incentive to create a drug for under</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.409" end="00:20:49.220" style="s2">200,000 people that you&#39;re never gonna</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.539" end="00:20:51.980" style="s2">see a profit on because you put in too</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.220" end="00:20:53.929" style="s2">much R&amp;D in order to to do that so that</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.980" end="00:20:56.539" style="s2">so if your population of people who need</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.929" end="00:20:59.450" style="s2">the drug is under 200,000 you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.539" end="00:21:01.730" style="s2">a patent that expires you get to keep</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.450" end="00:21:02.809" style="s2">that patent and so Gilead I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.730" end="00:21:04.370" style="s2">which drug it is whether it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.809" end="00:21:07.610" style="s2">malaria drug or what it is but they put</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.370" end="00:21:10.640" style="s2">in for that before this reached 200,000</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.610" end="00:21:13.210" style="s2">in the United States and the wording is</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.640" end="00:21:15.260" style="s2">that that&#39;s like if you&#39;re at you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.210" end="00:21:16.789" style="s2">195,000 and you got the pack and you get</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.260" end="00:21:20.840" style="s2">this time protection for an orphan drug</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.789" end="00:21:23.330" style="s2">and then it goes you know 2,500 people</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.840" end="00:21:25.220" style="s2">they&#39;re not gonna take it away and so</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.330" end="00:21:26.779" style="s2">that makes sense for a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.220" end="00:21:28.490" style="s2">right you have a genetic disorder you</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.779" end="00:21:31.309" style="s2">have other things and and it&#39;s under</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.490" end="00:21:32.990" style="s2">200,000 and it creeps up beyond it but</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.309" end="00:21:34.460" style="s2">this thing we knew was gonna be in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.990" end="00:21:36.890" style="s2">tens of billions hundreds of millions</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.460" end="00:21:39.559" style="s2">worldwide and for a company to want to</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.890" end="00:21:41.690" style="s2">patent it so that only they can provide</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.559" end="00:21:43.070" style="s2">it an American company who clearly isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.690" end="00:21:44.059" style="s2">in it for the health and only in it for</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.070" end="00:21:45.830" style="s2">the profit because the American</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.059" end="00:21:48.440" style="s2">healthcare systems only it for profit</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.830" end="00:21:50.779" style="s2">and not for actual health its names</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.440" end="00:21:52.340" style="s2">Gilead it&#39;s true and I&#39;m like this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.779" end="00:21:54.559" style="s2">how the patent system gets brought down</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.340" end="00:21:56.270" style="s2">like what the people in power right now</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.559" end="00:21:59.390" style="s2">are gonna learn but they haven&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.270" end="00:22:00.860" style="s2">loaded yet is that this is showing us</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.390" end="00:22:02.090" style="s2">how interconnected we are and all the</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.860" end="00:22:05.899" style="s2">things that are broken</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.090" end="00:22:09.610" style="s2">there is someone suing people are making</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.899" end="00:22:12.350" style="s2">3d printed parts for the respirator and</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.610" end="00:22:13.730" style="s2">the proof of people who patented the</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.350" end="00:22:15.169" style="s2">respirator and how the respirators are</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.730" end="00:22:15.530" style="s2">like well we&#39;re gonna sue you that is</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.169" end="00:22:17.540" style="s2">our in</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.530" end="00:22:19.490" style="s2">electril property it&#39;s like good luck</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.540" end="00:22:22.310" style="s2">existing in the world after this if you</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.490" end="00:22:23.630" style="s2">actually do that humanity came together</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.310" end="00:22:25.370" style="s2">figure out how to 3d print these things</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.630" end="00:22:28.340" style="s2">we can have enough so we can save lives</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.370" end="00:22:29.990" style="s2">and if you had been a human</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.340" end="00:22:31.640" style="s2">being and been like listen we have to</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.990" end="00:22:34.310" style="s2">make it we have to make you know money</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.640" end="00:22:35.780" style="s2">enough to stay alive as well so we need</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.310" end="00:22:37.760" style="s2">to get 10 cents out of every one that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.780" end="00:22:40.250" style="s2">printed please keep track of it right</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.760" end="00:22:42.410" style="s2">that&#39;s a very different than like no you</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.250" end="00:22:45.590" style="s2">need to buy them from us for $400 I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.410" end="00:22:47.000" style="s2">making up numbers actually is but and</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.590" end="00:22:48.620" style="s2">you have to buy them through us and we</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.000" end="00:22:50.120" style="s2">can jack up the prices much want or we</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.620" end="00:22:56.120" style="s2">can be benevolent and give it to you at</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.120" end="00:22:58.100" style="s2">cost you&#39;re going to break like you even</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.120" end="00:22:59.540" style="s2">can&#39;t win that lawsuit not with what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.100" end="00:23:00.890" style="s2">about to happen and people run to lose</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.540" end="00:23:03.290" style="s2">lives and they would have lost even more</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.890" end="00:23:04.790" style="s2">lives and gilead it&#39;s like if you really</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.290" end="00:23:06.890" style="s2">want to go for this patent protection on</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.790" end="00:23:10.040" style="s2">this drug you&#39;re gonna not just break</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.890" end="00:23:11.930" style="s2">that because because Canada better not</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.040" end="00:23:13.850" style="s2">hold up hold it Australia better not</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.930" end="00:23:15.950" style="s2">uphold it and so you&#39;re gonna break the</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.850" end="00:23:17.630" style="s2">world patent system because if America</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.950" end="00:23:19.310" style="s2">is like yes hundred dollar upheld for</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.630" end="00:23:22.310" style="s2">each of your citizens and even if Canada</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.310" end="00:23:24.860" style="s2">could afford that India can&#39;t China</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.310" end="00:23:28.730" style="s2">can&#39;t shine again but they won&#39;t Hey</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.860" end="00:23:30.230" style="s2">like there&#39;s we need to be providing</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.730" end="00:23:32.990" style="s2">whatever treatment options there are</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.230" end="00:23:36.310" style="s2">whatever vaccine options there are we</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.990" end="00:23:36.310" style="s2">need to provide it for seven</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.220" end="00:23:46.650" style="s2">I need better profit maybe but the</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.320" end="00:23:47.970" style="s2">world&#39;s doing Oh spirits like a blip I</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.650" end="00:23:49.620" style="s2">don&#39;t feel like the screen changed but I</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.970" end="00:23:53.429" style="s2">don&#39;t know how I don&#39;t know how it</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.620" end="00:23:56.280" style="s2">changed so there&#39;s a lot that we could</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.429" end="00:23:59.490" style="s2">do if we were able to do it together in</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.280" end="00:24:02.850" style="s2">a way that isn&#39;t a company like Google</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.490" end="00:24:04.530" style="s2">deciding what they&#39;re gonna do with our</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.850" end="00:24:06.360" style="s2">data and they can&#39;t even though they</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.530" end="00:24:08.460" style="s2">have all of that information they have</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.360" end="00:24:10.650" style="s2">the information of our phones they</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.460" end="00:24:13.049" style="s2">understandably can&#39;t share that with us</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.650" end="00:24:14.549" style="s2">with each other with the government they</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.049" end="00:24:18.809" style="s2">might they might because again this is</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.549" end="00:24:20.280" style="s2">extraordinary times but we could we</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.809" end="00:24:22.559" style="s2">could decide and I don&#39;t get to decide</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.280" end="00:24:24.090" style="s2">if you want to give your data but if we</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.559" end="00:24:25.799" style="s2">have the conversation of what would make</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.090" end="00:24:28.320" style="s2">you feel safe enough to give your data</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.799" end="00:24:30.450" style="s2">so that you&#39;re you have a Fitbit and it</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.320" end="00:24:32.130" style="s2">goes back into the system if you have</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.450" end="00:24:33.299" style="s2">your genetic information you&#39;re willing</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.130" end="00:24:35.429" style="s2">to put that in the system so whatever</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.299" end="00:24:37.559" style="s2">does happen to you we can find the</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.429" end="00:24:39.210" style="s2">common cause right if we can if we have</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.559" end="00:24:40.799" style="s2">people&#39;s genomes in the system and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.210" end="00:24:41.929" style="s2">they get koban 19 and the people who</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.799" end="00:24:44.309" style="s2">died or the people who are asymptomatic</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.929" end="00:24:47.130" style="s2">my guess is there&#39;s a genetic component</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.309" end="00:24:48.870" style="s2">and we&#39;d be able to tell certain we&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.130" end="00:24:50.909" style="s2">able to know are you are you the person</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.870" end="00:24:52.320" style="s2">who&#39;s gonna be asymptomatic or are you</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.909" end="00:24:54.539" style="s2">the people who are gonna die for this</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.320" end="00:24:56.159" style="s2">most likely and it won&#39;t be perfect data</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.539" end="00:25:00.780" style="s2">but it would help us know where we need</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.159" end="00:25:02.909" style="s2">to spend our resources covering patients</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.780" end="00:25:04.289" style="s2">it&#39;s working yeah no I that is one of</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.909" end="00:25:05.820" style="s2">one of the treatments for sure I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.289" end="00:25:09.539" style="s2">comes with risks and it comes with a</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.820" end="00:25:13.340" style="s2">whole host of other other issues that</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.539" end="00:25:17.970" style="s2">are beyond you know health issues like</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.340" end="00:25:21.000" style="s2">with any type of blood or gamete donate</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.970" end="00:25:22.799" style="s2">donation or organ donation that it needs</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.000" end="00:25:24.960" style="s2">to not be for profit right it needs to</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.799" end="00:25:27.020" style="s2">be it goes to those who most need it and</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.960" end="00:25:28.950" style="s2">not those who have the most money and</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.020" end="00:25:31.020" style="s2">guaranteed it will go to those who have</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.950" end="00:25:35.340" style="s2">the most money it&#39;ll go to the</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.020" end="00:25:36.780" style="s2">politicians and the people who can even</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.340" end="00:25:39.360" style="s2">if they&#39;re not paying for that their</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.780" end="00:25:41.880" style="s2">their privilege puts them at the head of</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.360" end="00:25:43.740" style="s2">the list and that&#39;s less likely to</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.880" end="00:25:46.350" style="s2">happen somewhere here like Canada but</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.740" end="00:25:48.419" style="s2">it&#39;s not it will it&#39;ll still happen and</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.350" end="00:25:50.860" style="s2">so that you need people who recovered</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.419" end="00:25:54.120" style="s2">and then who you give that to because</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.860" end="00:25:56.500" style="s2">you need a certain number if you have a</p>

<p begin="00:26:03.250" end="00:26:08.020" style="s2">to put the needle in the arm get the</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.720" end="00:26:10.510" style="s2">plasma out what&#39;s the word manufacture</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.020" end="00:26:12.070" style="s2">the plasma make it safer and then put it</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.510" end="00:26:16.090" style="s2">in the in the new person there&#39;s that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:26:18.100" end="00:26:20.799" style="s2">right so we still have to have that</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.179" end="00:26:22.330" style="s2">information the data and it is a very</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.799" end="00:26:25.150" style="s2">promising thing that&#39;s basically what</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.330" end="00:26:26.860" style="s2">vaccines do is they give your body like</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.150" end="00:26:29.710" style="s2">a training lesson in in fighting the</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.860" end="00:26:32.230" style="s2">disease and so that&#39;s what this plasma</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.710" end="00:26:34.780" style="s2">it&#39;s like a pre vaccine like but we</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.230" end="00:26:37.030" style="s2">don&#39;t know whether just because you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.780" end="00:26:39.640" style="s2">just bought off Koba 19 how long are you</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.030" end="00:26:42.340" style="s2">immune for it could be you know a month</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.640" end="00:26:43.900" style="s2">it could be lifetime it could be like we</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.340" end="00:26:45.610" style="s2">don&#39;t know and it&#39;s you&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.900" end="00:26:50.620" style="s2">immune until it evolves but how fast is</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.610" end="00:26:52.840" style="s2">this thing about and then so how long</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.620" end="00:26:54.490" style="s2">after you&#39;ve had Koba 19 can your plasma</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.840" end="00:26:57.280" style="s2">be use how much of your plasma can be</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.490" end="00:27:01.299" style="s2">used so that you&#39;re still safe right and</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.280" end="00:27:03.429" style="s2">you&#39;re helping other people and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.299" end="00:27:05.620" style="s2">like if there is a is a drug because</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.429" end="00:27:10.390" style="s2">they also that&#39;s not gonna make the</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.620" end="00:27:12.850" style="s2">money like you can&#39;t really patent</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.390" end="00:27:16.270" style="s2">someone&#39;s plasma I&#39;m sure they will try</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.850" end="00:27:17.650" style="s2">but so that&#39;s not actually something</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.270" end="00:27:18.700" style="s2">that they&#39;re gonna that&#39;s not where</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.650" end="00:27:20.049" style="s2">they&#39;re putting their own t money and</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.700" end="00:27:21.880" style="s2">that&#39;s probably where dr. is an actual</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.049" end="00:27:23.530" style="s2">scientists are like yes let&#39;s try this</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.880" end="00:27:26.169" style="s2">and it&#39;s working so let&#39;s let&#39;s keep</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.530" end="00:27:27.790" style="s2">doing it but you you don&#39;t you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.169" end="00:27:28.870" style="s2">manufacture that but you could find out</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.790" end="00:27:30.400" style="s2">what that is and make that you helped</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.870" end="00:27:33.940" style="s2">make you that into a vaccine and help</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.400" end="00:27:35.350" style="s2">doing those those things but I mean</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.940" end="00:27:38.049" style="s2">we&#39;re kind of flying by the seat of our</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.350" end="00:27:40.750" style="s2">pants here at 19 when it&#39;s like we this</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.049" end="00:27:42.880" style="s2">is a drug drug this is a virus that we</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.750" end="00:27:46.750" style="s2">don&#39;t know there we have been studying</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.880" end="00:27:50.380" style="s2">kovat a corona like viruses for a while</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.750" end="00:27:52.090" style="s2">but this is on a different level this is</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.380" end="00:27:55.150" style="s2">instead of a hypothetical if it crosses</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.090" end="00:27:56.770" style="s2">over to humans it&#39;s in humans luckily it</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.150" end="00:27:58.900" style="s2">only kills one to three percent of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.770" end="00:28:00.220" style="s2">population because if this thing killed</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.900" end="00:28:03.900" style="s2">thirty to forty percent of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.220" end="00:28:05.790" style="s2">population stayin at home would</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.900" end="00:28:07.350" style="s2">like wouldn&#39;t work and we it would be</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.790" end="00:28:10.320" style="s2">much more devastating it&#39;s already going</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.350" end="00:28:11.580" style="s2">to be devastating that could be</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.320" end="00:28:13.440" style="s2">something that happens it could be</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.580" end="00:28:16.620" style="s2">something that that involves and changes</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.440" end="00:28:18.390" style="s2">but we can&#39;t we can&#39;t really fight a</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.620" end="00:28:20.220" style="s2">virus right we can come up with vaccines</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.390" end="00:28:22.080" style="s2">we can come up with treatments but we</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.220" end="00:28:25.440" style="s2">can&#39;t annihilate it it&#39;s too it&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.080" end="00:28:26.910" style="s2">far now and we can&#39;t like we have to</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.440" end="00:28:29.280" style="s2">figure out how to deal with this thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.910" end="00:28:31.560" style="s2">week it&#39;s not and it&#39;s this is people</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.280" end="00:28:35.160" style="s2">that said this is the new war but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.560" end="00:28:37.050" style="s2">also not a war that you can really rally</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.160" end="00:28:38.220" style="s2">the troops around in the same old way</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.050" end="00:28:39.150" style="s2">that you rally the troops around for</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.220" end="00:28:42.150" style="s2">other war right where you had to</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.150" end="00:28:44.100" style="s2">dehumanize the enemy the human enemies</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.150" end="00:28:47.640" style="s2">already dehumanize it&#39;s a virus it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.100" end="00:28:49.980" style="s2">barely a biology it&#39;s by barely alive it</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.640" end="00:28:51.780" style="s2">kind of anything you give is a</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.980" end="00:28:53.910" style="s2">definition for something being alive</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.780" end="00:28:55.950" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really apply it to a virus</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.910" end="00:28:57.780" style="s2">generally speaking because if it</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.950" end="00:28:59.670" style="s2">suggests that it has genetic code you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.780" end="00:29:02.670" style="s2">dead skin cells have genetic code is it</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.670" end="00:29:06.390" style="s2">alive no and it&#39;s it&#39;s just part of what</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.670" end="00:29:07.740" style="s2">breaks biology is viruses the definition</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.390" end="00:29:10.500" style="s2">of the species is definitely should have</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.740" end="00:29:14.010" style="s2">Alive and so I don&#39;t my point that was</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.500" end="00:29:17.070" style="s2">except that oh that this is a war that</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.010" end="00:29:18.720" style="s2">we have so it&#39;s both like bringing</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.070" end="00:29:20.610" style="s2">humanity together in a way we never</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.720" end="00:29:22.500" style="s2">could before because it&#39;s like you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.610" end="00:29:24.540" style="s2">really pick sides on this what are you</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.500" end="00:29:26.190" style="s2">on the side of the virus you can pick</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.540" end="00:29:27.450" style="s2">sides on you think the media&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.190" end="00:29:29.520" style="s2">overhyping and you don&#39;t think we should</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.450" end="00:29:30.360" style="s2">be taking the projects we are or on the</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.520" end="00:29:33.450" style="s2">other side you don&#39;t think we&#39;re taking</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.360" end="00:29:37.890" style="s2">enough precautions but the virus itself</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.450" end="00:29:38.220" style="s2">can&#39;t be argued with like it does what</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.890" end="00:29:40.890" style="s2">it does</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.220" end="00:29:42.480" style="s2">you can&#39;t like I haven&#39;t you only kill</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.890" end="00:29:44.160" style="s2">what in a thousand people that&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.480" end="00:29:45.450" style="s2">great we&#39;d really like that that would</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.160" end="00:29:46.920" style="s2">be closer to the measles and we&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.450" end="00:29:49.050" style="s2">very okay with that please kill one and</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.920" end="00:29:52.080" style="s2">it&#39;s out some people isn&#39;t gonna happen</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.050" end="00:29:55.350" style="s2">right we can&#39;t we can&#39;t have a ceasefire</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.080" end="00:29:59.610" style="s2">on this we can&#39;t argue and so this is</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.350" end="00:30:01.620" style="s2">testing all of our other oh we couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.610" end="00:30:04.260" style="s2">possibly do that we can&#39;t shut down the</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.620" end="00:30:07.860" style="s2">economy for climate change are you</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.260" end="00:30:10.320" style="s2">ridiculous we need jobs but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.860" end="00:30:14.910" style="s2">shutting it down for a virus and this</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.320" end="00:30:17.400" style="s2">virus has a two week time span a meaning</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.910" end="00:30:20.430" style="s2">that you see the positive used</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.400" end="00:30:22.640" style="s2">to see the positive impact of having</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.430" end="00:30:25.050" style="s2">citizens stay inside about two weeks out</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.640" end="00:30:28.830" style="s2">because the incubation periods two weeks</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.050" end="00:30:31.050" style="s2">and you start seeing the numbers the</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.830" end="00:30:32.700" style="s2">percentages of increase is going down so</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.050" end="00:30:35.070" style="s2">instead of being 20% increase today it</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.700" end="00:30:36.870" style="s2">goes down you know 18% 17% it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.070" end="00:30:38.160" style="s2">skyrocketing which is why it&#39;s just so</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.870" end="00:30:41.730" style="s2">scary about what&#39;s happening in America</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.160" end="00:30:44.250" style="s2">right now and in Europe and it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.730" end="00:30:49.940" style="s2">starting in in a lot of the African</p>

<p begin="00:32:42.340" end="00:32:47.649" style="s2">there&#39;s going to be chance to cross over</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.539" end="00:32:50.320" style="s2">and with the climate change going up our</p>

<p begin="00:32:55.299" end="00:32:59.590" style="s2">are warmer more chemical reactions and</p>

<p begin="00:33:07.299" end="00:33:11.110" style="s2">it&#39;s doing the fact it had is the fact</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.220" end="00:33:12.700" style="s2">there&#39;s asymptomatic people you can</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.110" end="00:33:14.350" style="s2">spread it the fact that it takes a</p>

<p begin="00:33:28.630" end="00:33:32.049" style="s2">like if you were mother like you could</p>

<p begin="00:33:32.049" end="00:33:35.740" style="s2">to go pandemic this would be the type of</p>

<p begin="00:33:35.740" end="00:33:39.820" style="s2">seriously you can have two sides to this</p>

<p begin="00:33:39.820" end="00:33:46.210" style="s2">it&#39;s not like oh you overhyped Ebola</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.370" end="00:33:48.190" style="s2">know most people die who get a bola but</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.210" end="00:33:50.380" style="s2">the results of extreme precautions taken</p>

<p begin="00:33:50.380" end="00:33:53.860" style="s2">were going through it so that they could</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.240" end="00:33:55.389" style="s2">deal with it not out of the goodness of</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.860" end="00:33:56.970" style="s2">their heart because they didn&#39;t want it</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.389" end="00:33:59.139" style="s2">to spread to everywhere in the world and</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.970" end="00:34:01.840" style="s2">Ebola is something that&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.139" end="00:34:04.409" style="s2">transmit you basically have to come in</p>

<p begin="00:34:04.409" end="00:34:09.310" style="s2">generally their I believe like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.090" end="00:34:12.149" style="s2">like very and yet that&#39;s happening as</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.310" end="00:34:15.070" style="s2">people are having horrible symptoms in</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.149" end="00:34:17.470" style="s2">when they have it that from a disease</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.070" end="00:34:19.540" style="s2">perspective we again we can&#39;t reason</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.470" end="00:34:20.889" style="s2">with it it&#39;s just for Biological beings</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.540" end="00:34:22.480" style="s2">and it is what it&#39;s happening and</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.889" end="00:34:24.580" style="s2">because we can&#39;t reason with it we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.480" end="00:34:28.510" style="s2">argue our way out of it we have to shut</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.580" end="00:34:30.879" style="s2">down our economies and so how important</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.510" end="00:34:34.030" style="s2">our economies there&#39;s real pieces to</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.879" end="00:34:34.929" style="s2">them we need food we need people to feel</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.030" end="00:34:36.429" style="s2">like they matter</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.929" end="00:34:39.190" style="s2">we need people&#39;s mental health and</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.429" end="00:34:41.050" style="s2">emotional health to be taken care of we</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.190" end="00:34:42.899" style="s2">need you know to be able to have access</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.050" end="00:34:45.270" style="s2">to goods that we rely on embedded</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.899" end="00:34:47.609" style="s2">send me rely on but there&#39;s also a large</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.270" end="00:34:50.520" style="s2">part of our part of our economic system</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.609" end="00:34:53.190" style="s2">that is absolutely useless and gives no</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.520" end="00:34:55.079" style="s2">amount of value and then there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.190" end="00:34:56.429" style="s2">parts of every corporation that are like</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.079" end="00:35:00.690" style="s2">that that are just kind of like tacked</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.429" end="00:35:02.160" style="s2">on jobs what are in oxygen you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.690" end="00:35:04.920" style="s2">that those things are important those</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.160" end="00:35:06.450" style="s2">things are important but that is I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.920" end="00:35:07.829" style="s2">this thing&#39;s how possible is your -</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.450" end="00:35:09.750" style="s2">pandemic I&#39;m giving you like the</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.829" end="00:35:14.609" style="s2">apocalypse during the Pens I made sorry</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.750" end="00:35:16.799" style="s2">about that cuz mmm this thing isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.609" end="00:35:19.140" style="s2">gonna go away we will find a new normal</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.799" end="00:35:22.319" style="s2">and that new normal can be better than</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.140" end="00:35:26.309" style="s2">anything we&#39;ve ever had we don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.319" end="00:35:28.470" style="s2">go back like our human psyche kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.309" end="00:35:30.059" style="s2">only knows what we give up and so the</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.470" end="00:35:31.380" style="s2">fact that we can&#39;t go to Starbucks the</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.059" end="00:35:33.180" style="s2">fact that we can&#39;t have our sporting</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.380" end="00:35:34.859" style="s2">teams the fact that we are weddings got</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.180" end="00:35:36.420" style="s2">canceled my kid just found out her camp</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.859" end="00:35:38.460" style="s2">got camo is probably gonna be cancelled</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.420" end="00:35:40.799" style="s2">this summer - look what I can&#39;t go to</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.460" end="00:35:42.660" style="s2">camp it&#39;s like yeah probably not this is</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.799" end="00:35:44.880" style="s2">gonna be a pause a year and then we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.660" end="00:35:48.450" style="s2">have to reevaluate like camp will still</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.880" end="00:35:51.779" style="s2">exist next year probably but things like</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.450" end="00:35:54.569" style="s2">Coachella things like Bernie man might</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.779" end="00:35:57.119" style="s2">not exist ever again we can&#39;t have more</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.569" end="00:35:59.250" style="s2">than you know 250 300 people getting</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.119" end="00:36:00.420" style="s2">together because that&#39;s what Bahamas</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.250" end="00:36:02.670" style="s2">spread and it&#39;s probably gonna become</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.420" end="00:36:05.160" style="s2">the flu where it&#39;s just everywhere all</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.670" end="00:36:07.230" style="s2">the time and so having a bunch of people</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.160" end="00:36:08.819" style="s2">congregated is always gonna spread and</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.230" end="00:36:11.039" style="s2">we&#39;re always gonna have these these huge</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.819" end="00:36:12.990" style="s2">but also our immune systems will once</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.039" end="00:36:16.279" style="s2">we&#39;ve had it once we&#39;ll know better how</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.990" end="00:36:18.750" style="s2">to how to prepare for it the next time</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.279" end="00:36:20.430" style="s2">in two months it will be over I mean</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.750" end="00:36:21.839" style="s2">there&#39;s a slight chance that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.430" end="00:36:23.700" style="s2">something we don&#39;t understand about it</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.839" end="00:36:24.990" style="s2">where it does just disappear a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.700" end="00:36:27.029" style="s2">pandemics in the past have just</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.990" end="00:36:28.589" style="s2">disappeared but that&#39;s because they kind</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.029" end="00:36:29.670" style="s2">of burned through the population and</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.589" end="00:36:32.819" style="s2">what we&#39;re trying to do is slap the</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.670" end="00:36:36.990" style="s2">curve because unlike in 1918 when the</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.819" end="00:36:38.400" style="s2">Spanish flu went through um one of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.990" end="00:36:39.720" style="s2">reasons it became appends emic was cause</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.400" end="00:36:42.690" style="s2">of World War two and people ship you</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.720" end="00:36:44.670" style="s2">know it all over the world and and just</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.690" end="00:36:46.650" style="s2">the reason it&#39;s called the Spanish flu</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.670" end="00:36:48.210" style="s2">is because Spain at the time wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.650" end="00:36:50.039" style="s2">involved in the war and so they they</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.210" end="00:36:51.900" style="s2">were the only ones taking data and</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.039" end="00:36:53.339" style="s2">information because no one else wanted</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.900" end="00:36:53.700" style="s2">to give the information for the enemy to</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.339" end="00:36:56.339" style="s2">find</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.700" end="00:36:58.140" style="s2">they all have the flu so every side of</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.339" end="00:37:01.740" style="s2">the army had the flu Spain was just the</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.140" end="00:37:03.000" style="s2">ones who gave that up yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.740" end="00:37:05.450" style="s2">they probably did disappear through herd</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.000" end="00:37:09.119" style="s2">immunity that&#39;s kind of how we fight</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.450" end="00:37:10.950" style="s2">biological is this way but if what</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.119" end="00:37:13.619" style="s2">we do is come up with a vaccine which</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.950" end="00:37:19.079" style="s2">also kind of gives hurt immunity then</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.619" end="00:37:20.490" style="s2">we&#39;re not we&#39;re finding an enemy who</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.079" end="00:37:21.930" style="s2">wins the arms race it&#39;s really what</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.490" end="00:37:24.809" style="s2">we&#39;re doing because it&#39;s not just about</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.930" end="00:37:26.880" style="s2">kovat 19 although it&#39;s taken a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.809" end="00:37:29.250" style="s2">years to get our next huge pandemic that</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.880" end="00:37:31.619" style="s2">we&#39;ve got this far like the Spanish flu</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.250" end="00:37:34.410" style="s2">our next one isn&#39;t a hundred years out</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.619" end="00:37:36.630" style="s2">our next ones next year a decade from</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.410" end="00:37:39.230" style="s2">now like it&#39;s not this thing will keep</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.630" end="00:37:41.910" style="s2">happening until we repair our planet and</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.230" end="00:37:44.099" style="s2">get our our bodies but better with</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.910" end="00:37:45.690" style="s2">proper nutrition and those are the</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.099" end="00:37:47.400" style="s2">things we can be doing I mean I have</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.690" end="00:37:48.599" style="s2">very little say on how the virus is</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.400" end="00:37:49.890" style="s2">gonna run out very little say and of</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.599" end="00:37:52.020" style="s2">course how our governments are gonna run</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.890" end="00:37:55.950" style="s2">it I can only I&#39;m someone who does not</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.020" end="00:37:58.079" style="s2">listen to our powers that be just to</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.950" end="00:38:01.020" style="s2">listen to our powers to be I question</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.079" end="00:38:03.960" style="s2">everything and I will be staying at home</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.020" end="00:38:04.890" style="s2">during this and I also get the other</p>

<p begin="00:38:43.680" end="00:38:49.579" style="s2">have to figure out a system where we can</p>

<p begin="00:38:49.579" end="00:38:53.309" style="s2">smaller experiments and be like okay</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.960" end="00:38:55.020" style="s2">well we&#39;re gonna try this and feed that</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.309" end="00:38:57.690" style="s2">information back into the systems in</p>

<p begin="00:39:13.360" end="00:39:16.900" style="s2">yeah governments all over the world are</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.440" end="00:39:19.340" style="s2">becoming more authoritarian right now</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.900" end="00:39:21.080" style="s2">but a large part of that it&#39;s like all</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.340" end="00:39:23.000" style="s2">of my friends or conspiracy theorists</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.080" end="00:39:24.590" style="s2">and all the people who are like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.000" end="00:39:25.940" style="s2">gonna take our rights away I&#39;m like yes</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.590" end="00:39:28.460" style="s2">and you&#39;re giving them every opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.940" end="00:39:30.440" style="s2">to if people listen and stay at home</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.460" end="00:39:32.240" style="s2">right now they have there&#39;s no way they</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.440" end="00:39:33.530" style="s2">could have the are the military involved</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.240" end="00:39:35.810" style="s2">policing people out in the streets if</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.530" end="00:39:40.840" style="s2">people were actually at home because</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.810" end="00:39:44.150" style="s2">people aren&#39;t at home then they go to</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.840" end="00:39:48.710" style="s2">let&#39;s why what LGBT people disappear</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.150" end="00:39:50.180" style="s2">because there&#39;s no merchants exactly we</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.710" end="00:39:52.820" style="s2">were all just doing it for the parade</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.180" end="00:39:56.210" style="s2">and now there&#39;s no parades I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.820" end="00:39:58.550" style="s2">and that like a lot of our big cultural</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.210" end="00:40:01.370" style="s2">celebrations are huge if we can&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.550" end="00:40:04.070" style="s2">back to that it sounds devastating at</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.370" end="00:40:06.410" style="s2">the same time having 50 to 100 people</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.070" end="00:40:10.370" style="s2">tiny celebrations all over the place</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.410" end="00:40:12.830" style="s2">people are invited to creating community</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.370" end="00:40:17.870" style="s2">and connection in a way we&#39;ve never had</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.830" end="00:40:22.630" style="s2">it before is possible and so everyone</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.870" end="00:40:24.590" style="s2">can still have a very fulfilling life</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.630" end="00:40:25.930" style="s2">even though we&#39;re never going to go back</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.590" end="00:40:29.120" style="s2">to normal</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.930" end="00:40:31.550" style="s2">it&#39;s just weather weather our new normal</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.120" end="00:40:32.660" style="s2">is a fascist dictatorship where we all</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.550" end="00:40:33.770" style="s2">have to listen to our government a</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.660" end="00:40:35.600" style="s2">hundred percent of the time and we have</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.770" end="00:40:37.370" style="s2">no way of banding together and taking</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.600" end="00:40:40.820" style="s2">back our power and they probably</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.370" end="00:40:43.040" style="s2">cancelled our internet or we can go to a</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.820" end="00:40:45.110" style="s2">world of we can learn from this and</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.040" end="00:40:48.530" style="s2">realize if anyone&#39;s in poverty it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.110" end="00:40:50.630" style="s2">gonna cost us all if we lose anyone we</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.530" end="00:40:53.030" style="s2">lose that we lose their their potential</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.630" end="00:40:55.460" style="s2">to give back to the world and that costs</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.030" end="00:40:58.040" style="s2">us all that people don&#39;t have access to</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.460" end="00:41:00.560" style="s2">health care costs us all and so we can</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.040" end="00:41:02.440" style="s2">those of us who want to can participate</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.560" end="00:41:06.590" style="s2">in creating a better world together</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.440" end="00:41:09.050" style="s2">where everyone is taken care of and that</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.590" end="00:41:10.820" style="s2">everyone can be internal and we just</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.050" end="00:41:12.890" style="s2">keep inviting more and more people so</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.820" end="00:41:16.010" style="s2">that&#39;s what the solution regimes are is</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.890" end="00:41:17.660" style="s2">how do we create a solution that we</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.010" end="00:41:20.480" style="s2">would want for 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.660" end="00:41:23.359" style="s2">people who each put in $10 therefore we</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.480" end="00:41:26.660" style="s2">have $100,000 and once we&#39;ve created a</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.359" end="00:41:33.319" style="s2">solution for them everyone&#39;s invited if</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.660" end="00:41:34.640" style="s2">we create a new platform we will be for</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.319" end="00:41:36.589" style="s2">the 10,000 people that&#39;s enough of a</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.640" end="00:41:38.089" style="s2">threshold to make it usable most of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.589" end="00:41:39.799" style="s2">things that are being done don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.089" end="00:41:41.510" style="s2">threshold of 10,000 people so they fall</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.799" end="00:41:43.579" style="s2">away because they can&#39;t be funded and</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.510" end="00:41:46.780" style="s2">it&#39;s not fun to hang out on it&#39;s saying</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.579" end="00:41:46.780" style="s2">that there isn&#39;t enough people on</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.440" end="00:41:53.660" style="s2">animals will be freed from circuses oh I</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.920" end="00:41:54.920" style="s2">see because we won&#39;t be going to them I</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.660" end="00:41:56.660" style="s2">was like they&#39;re nothing is gonna set</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.920" end="00:41:59.599" style="s2">all the animals free that sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.660" end="00:42:02.750" style="s2">lions and tigers out of the streets yes</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.599" end="00:42:04.490" style="s2">yes I would say I mean at least in North</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.750" end="00:42:05.930" style="s2">America most of those things already</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.490" end="00:42:08.510" style="s2">have been shut down for animal rights</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.930" end="00:42:12.740" style="s2">reasons for a long time but even</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.510" end="00:42:15.430" style="s2">circuses like service de Soleil yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.740" end="00:42:17.930" style="s2">what&#39;s it gonna be pissed I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.430" end="00:42:20.180" style="s2">anything that&#39;s big like that like even</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.930" end="00:42:23.000" style="s2">going to the movie theatre is like 250</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.180" end="00:42:24.859" style="s2">people that&#39;s probably our limit is the</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.000" end="00:42:26.720" style="s2">movie theater so anything bigger than</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.859" end="00:42:28.789" style="s2">that but that&#39;s I&#39;m not the one making</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.720" end="00:42:31.160" style="s2">rules and so maybe we come if we come up</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.789" end="00:42:33.140" style="s2">with a vaccine that lasts it gives you</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.160" end="00:42:34.700" style="s2">life long or 10-year immunity then</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.140" end="00:42:38.089" style="s2">whatever thing I said goes by the</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.700" end="00:42:39.470" style="s2">wayside but if this is the flu and we</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.089" end="00:42:41.420" style="s2">need a new one every year we&#39;re never</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.470" end="00:42:44.359" style="s2">going to be able to the reason the flu</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.420" end="00:42:46.910" style="s2">vaccine works is enough people get it</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.359" end="00:42:49.700" style="s2">and it&#39;s not deadly and like it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.910" end="00:42:58.369" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work when the death rate is</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.700" end="00:43:05.119" style="s2">higher says I will move to normal copa90</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.369" end="00:43:08.000" style="s2">mo mutate itself that you think things</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.119" end="00:43:09.770" style="s2">will remove you know you think things go</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.000" end="00:43:13.670" style="s2">back to normal because copa90 mutates</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.770" end="00:43:15.109" style="s2">cuz that&#39;s not a that&#39;s from my</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.670" end="00:43:17.589" style="s2">understanding of biology and I am a</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.109" end="00:43:19.839" style="s2">biologist by my trade at university</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.589" end="00:43:22.430" style="s2">that&#39;s not possible</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.839" end="00:43:24.079" style="s2">but science also doesn&#39;t take into they</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.430" end="00:43:26.390" style="s2">who they like don&#39;t like the deal with</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.079" end="00:43:28.279" style="s2">the impossible so they just ignore it so</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.390" end="00:43:30.960" style="s2">I mean that is what has happened with</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.279" end="00:43:32.430" style="s2">the several of the pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.960" end="00:43:34.140" style="s2">and epidemics that have went through the</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.430" end="00:43:36.410" style="s2">human population as we do develop herd</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.140" end="00:43:38.580" style="s2">immunity we do develop those things but</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.410" end="00:43:40.560" style="s2">that&#39;ll take a long time and like I said</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.580" end="00:43:42.839" style="s2">this is not a one-off this is gonna keep</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.560" end="00:43:44.220" style="s2">happening we&#39;re different we won&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.839" end="00:43:45.510" style="s2">what the next one is right the next</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.220" end="00:43:47.400" style="s2">one&#39;s not going to be a respiratory</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.510" end="00:43:49.710" style="s2">illness that that waits for two weeks</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.400" end="00:43:51.570" style="s2">and has a cement Ematic people and you</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.710" end="00:43:54.300" style="s2">have to wear a mask and you like all you</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.570" end="00:43:58.680" style="s2">have to do is wash your hands it could</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.300" end="00:44:00.450" style="s2">be airborne it could be it could be have</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.680" end="00:44:01.770" style="s2">a even longer incubation period it could</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.450" end="00:44:03.330" style="s2">be even more deadly it could be not a</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.770" end="00:44:05.270" style="s2">respiratory thing so all the respirators</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.330" end="00:44:07.200" style="s2">we have stacked up have no no effective</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.270" end="00:44:09.060" style="s2">effectiveness the face shields might not</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.200" end="00:44:10.200" style="s2">be the thing we use like there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.060" end="00:44:12.420" style="s2">face shields actually are almost always</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.200" end="00:44:13.859" style="s2">use that the like n95 masks might not be</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.420" end="00:44:16.920" style="s2">the thing that helps the next the next</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.859" end="00:44:19.560" style="s2">kind of it and so we have to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.920" end="00:44:23.880" style="s2">create the systems not just for pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.560" end="00:44:25.589" style="s2">but for all of the chaos that&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.880" end="00:44:28.050" style="s2">down the line all the natural disasters</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.589" end="00:44:29.609" style="s2">all of the let&#39;s get away with war it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:44:30.570" end="00:44:34.349" style="s2">everything else but again we don&#39;t have</p>

<p begin="00:44:36.450" end="00:44:42.510" style="s2">we want to be part of and then invite</p>

<p begin="00:44:51.240" end="00:44:56.280" style="s2">have and everywhere we should be</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.359" end="00:44:58.560" style="s2">thinking about that because at least</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.280" end="00:45:00.030" style="s2">where I am it&#39;s it&#39;s April yeah well</p>

<p begin="00:45:00.030" end="00:45:04.500" style="s2">spring-like that&#39;s just yours to know</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.010" end="00:45:05.670" style="s2">that&#39;s for you my country where most</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.500" end="00:45:07.170" style="s2">people should have their gardens in</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.670" end="00:45:12.359" style="s2">already if they&#39;re gonna have a garden</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.170" end="00:45:14.130" style="s2">I&#39;m not one of those people and so the</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.359" end="00:45:18.859" style="s2">idea of herd immunity is absolutely not</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.130" end="00:45:22.230" style="s2">verified it&#39;s just a mathematical model</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.859" end="00:45:24.510" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s like something that makes</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.230" end="00:45:28.770" style="s2">sense but has it been tested and</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.510" end="00:45:30.750" style="s2">verified no no no NASA and in fact a lot</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.770" end="00:45:33.660" style="s2">of what we saw before the measles</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.750" end="00:45:35.339" style="s2">vaccine measles was when I smallpox</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.660" end="00:45:38.550" style="s2">might have also been one you see the</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.339" end="00:45:40.170" style="s2">morality mortality rate go down to</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.550" end="00:45:41.369" style="s2">almost zero meaning people were still</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.170" end="00:45:43.260" style="s2">absolutely getting it</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.369" end="00:45:44.040" style="s2">they just weren&#39;t dying from it and then</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.260" end="00:45:46.590" style="s2">the vaccine was</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.040" end="00:45:48.090" style="s2">introduced and you have a lot more a lot</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.590" end="00:45:51.120" style="s2">less people getting it understandably</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.090" end="00:45:52.890" style="s2">because there&#39;s a vaccine and morality</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.120" end="00:45:54.690" style="s2">mortality rate from what I know say the</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.890" end="00:45:56.340" style="s2">same but we you don&#39;t pass your</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.690" end="00:45:59.820" style="s2">vaccinated status on to your children</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.340" end="00:46:02.040" style="s2">you do pass your immunity on to them</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.820" end="00:46:06.900" style="s2">both because they have your genetics and</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.040" end="00:46:09.480" style="s2">you survives but also milks weird milk</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.900" end="00:46:15.270" style="s2">it in utero like the whole immune system</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.480" end="00:46:16.740" style="s2">is absolutely crazy in it ya know there</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.270" end="00:46:18.630" style="s2">is like if you survive if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.740" end="00:46:20.040" style="s2">susceptible you die and if you survive</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.630" end="00:46:24.000" style="s2">and you&#39;re helping with herd immunity</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.040" end="00:46:25.500" style="s2">but that&#39;s different than if again if</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.000" end="00:46:27.090" style="s2">this is something we can find a vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.500" end="00:46:28.590" style="s2">for and it&#39;s like the measles where you</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.090" end="00:46:33.210" style="s2">just need to get a booster every ten</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.590" end="00:46:36.540" style="s2">years then we could fight this one with</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.210" end="00:46:39.810" style="s2">a vaccine but not the next one and what</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.540" end="00:46:42.450" style="s2">do we like I flew twice during this</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.810" end="00:46:43.830" style="s2">pandemic and I never fly but I flew from</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.450" end="00:46:47.700" style="s2">Vancouver Edmonton and went into</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.830" end="00:46:49.320" style="s2">Vancouver and I was astounded that there</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.700" end="00:46:51.630" style="s2">was no like me my kid have had a cough</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.320" end="00:46:53.820" style="s2">since January and so we&#39;re coffee no one</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.630" end="00:46:56.280" style="s2">has asked us if we had it no one&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.820" end="00:46:57.960" style="s2">could you wear a mask they don&#39;t test</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.280" end="00:47:00.050" style="s2">your temperature they don&#39;t do they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.960" end="00:47:02.790" style="s2">not doing anything no screening and</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.050" end="00:47:06.870" style="s2">coming back same thing I was like this</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.790" end="00:47:09.240" style="s2">is ridiculous actually like we we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.870" end="00:47:11.280" style="s2">gonna need a new normal just like 9/11</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.240" end="00:47:13.530" style="s2">changed our airports immensely so that</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.280" end="00:47:15.810" style="s2">you know you can&#39;t bring more than 100</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.530" end="00:47:17.640" style="s2">milliliters of a liquid on a plane it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.810" end="00:47:21.600" style="s2">like you can&#39;t get on a plane if you</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.640" end="00:47:22.710" style="s2">have a fever and we test absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.600" end="00:47:24.210" style="s2">everyone and if you&#39;re someone who</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.710" end="00:47:26.130" style="s2">constantly runs a fever for other</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.210" end="00:47:27.720" style="s2">reasons you need to have a medical note</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.130" end="00:47:29.610" style="s2">dictating that and we need to have</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.720" end="00:47:31.260" style="s2">information that is reliable or when</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.610" end="00:47:33.360" style="s2">someone&#39;s been sick on a plane that</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.260" end="00:47:35.010" style="s2">information goes out to all of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.360" end="00:47:36.600" style="s2">people who are on that plane and they</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.010" end="00:47:38.610" style="s2">sell quarantine and we have the systems</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.600" end="00:47:39.930" style="s2">in place to help themselves warranty</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.610" end="00:47:43.110" style="s2">because that&#39;s the other thing that this</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.930" end="00:47:44.490" style="s2">is showcasing people can&#39;t always do the</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.110" end="00:47:46.980" style="s2">right thing just because you want them</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.490" end="00:47:50.370" style="s2">to do the right thing and what is the</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.980" end="00:47:52.110" style="s2">right thing they when when our response</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.370" end="00:47:54.180" style="s2">to this is go home and self quarantine</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.110" end="00:47:55.650" style="s2">for two weeks we found in any</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.180" end="00:47:57.040" style="s2">understanding of how someone does that</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.650" end="00:47:58.720" style="s2">when they don&#39;t have groceries</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.040" end="00:48:01.330" style="s2">how somebody does that when they need</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.720" end="00:48:02.980" style="s2">medication we and the government doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.330" end="00:48:04.390" style="s2">know how to respond to that and so where</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.980" end="00:48:06.430" style="s2">people have taken that out people are</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.390" end="00:48:08.710" style="s2">like okay the senior citizens you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.430" end="00:48:10.540" style="s2">leave because they&#39;re they&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.710" end="00:48:12.010" style="s2">susceptible there&#39;s people who are</p>

<p begin="00:48:17.680" end="00:48:22.380" style="s2">things we should be doing and that might</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.420" end="00:48:26.470" style="s2">be where this does not go back to normal</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.380" end="00:48:28.930" style="s2">the fact that you could go to you could</p>

<p begin="00:48:33.840" end="00:48:38.620" style="s2">there used to be quarantined right when</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.580" end="00:48:41.410" style="s2">that was mean we were on ships when you</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.620" end="00:48:44.710" style="s2">would cross the ocean and before</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.410" end="00:48:46.720" style="s2">vaccines we need quarantines again which</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.710" end="00:48:48.670" style="s2">means you don&#39;t just get to go tricks</p>

<p begin="00:50:40.840" end="00:50:44.619" style="s2">come six amazing solutions and that was</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.060" end="00:50:46.720" style="s2">only over a six-hour period that was</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.619" end="00:50:48.820" style="s2">like an hour for education an hour for</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.720" end="00:50:51.400" style="s2">food an hour for transportation hour for</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.820" end="00:50:52.420" style="s2">infectious disease and three to five of</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.400" end="00:50:53.980" style="s2">us are able to come up with amazing</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.420" end="00:50:56.349" style="s2">solutions in that time period that could</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.980" end="00:50:57.940" style="s2">be implemented right now and so what I</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.349" end="00:50:59.920" style="s2">want to do during this time is either</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.940" end="00:51:03.730" style="s2">showcase those showcase what those look</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.920" end="00:51:05.680" style="s2">like online so do them live do one on</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.730" end="00:51:07.240" style="s2">mental health do you want ANCOVA 19 do</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.680" end="00:51:09.430" style="s2">you want on any of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.240" end="00:51:10.900" style="s2">people wants to talk about then they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.430" end="00:51:13.119" style="s2">neat I can&#39;t do them by myself I needs</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.900" end="00:51:15.130" style="s2">to do other people on camera but what I</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.119" end="00:51:18.820" style="s2">really want is the people who want to</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.130" end="00:51:20.380" style="s2">have the meta conversation so not just</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.820" end="00:51:22.080" style="s2">come up with a solution for food not</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.380" end="00:51:24.460" style="s2">just come up with a solution for</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.080" end="00:51:26.619" style="s2">transportation but to come up with a</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.460" end="00:51:28.930" style="s2">solution for how we come up with</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.619" end="00:51:31.450" style="s2">solutions so solution raising is the</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.930" end="00:51:33.609" style="s2">first part of that because we&#39;re able to</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.450" end="00:51:36.190" style="s2">generate potential ideas in an hour and</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.609" end="00:51:38.920" style="s2">it&#39;s and it&#39;s scalable like you can have</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.190" end="00:51:40.300" style="s2">it&#39;s scalable right now to a hundred to</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.920" end="00:51:42.700" style="s2">five hundred right like I can deal with</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.300" end="00:51:44.859" style="s2">five hundred people that week on zoom&#39;</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.700" end="00:51:46.869" style="s2">calls and we could raise education from</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.859" end="00:51:49.030" style="s2">the week we could have you know a</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.869" end="00:51:50.740" style="s2">hundred different conversations five</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.030" end="00:51:52.690" style="s2">people in each conversation where we</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.740" end="00:51:54.250" style="s2">were generating a hundred different</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.690" end="00:51:56.170" style="s2">possible outcomes and then vote on which</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.250" end="00:51:58.510" style="s2">one we like the best and then the next</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.170" end="00:52:00.849" style="s2">week help improve that one but what we</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.510" end="00:52:02.710" style="s2">need to do eventually is get to 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.849" end="00:52:04.060" style="s2">people so what Jordan Holland say</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.710" end="00:52:06.490" style="s2">yesterday and I agree I think this is a</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.060" end="00:52:09.550" style="s2">good is to find a system that works for</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.490" end="00:52:11.140" style="s2">a thousand people to create a solution</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.550" end="00:52:13.210" style="s2">together and then have each of those</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.140" end="00:52:16.450" style="s2">thousand go out and bite and buy ten and</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.210" end="00:52:18.910" style="s2">that&#39;s where I differ in a lot of what</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.450" end="00:52:20.710" style="s2">everyone else wants to do I don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.910" end="00:52:22.570" style="s2">the elite of society to come and come</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.710" end="00:52:23.620" style="s2">and do this I need everyday people to</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.570" end="00:52:25.240" style="s2">come and do this ever</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.620" end="00:52:26.560" style="s2">one has something to give everyone has</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.240" end="00:52:28.780" style="s2">an opinion everyone brings their own</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.560" end="00:52:30.970" style="s2">life experience to the team it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.780" end="00:52:34.060" style="s2">finding out how we can work together at</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.970" end="00:52:35.950" style="s2">that level at the 7.5 billion people</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.060" end="00:52:38.650" style="s2">level not leaving solutions up to our</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.950" end="00:52:40.420" style="s2">governments working with 7.5 billion</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.650" end="00:52:41.950" style="s2">people is next to impossible so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.420" end="00:52:45.760" style="s2">gonna figure it out for a thousand and</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.950" end="00:52:49.240" style="s2">then we&#39;re going to invite 10 people</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.760" end="00:52:50.350" style="s2">each and then we&#39;ll be at 10,000 see you</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.240" end="00:52:57.940" style="s2">said by us you&#39;re probably already gone</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.350" end="00:53:00.760" style="s2">but I made a bakery that if there were</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.940" end="00:53:02.200" style="s2">three to four of us here live not</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.760" end="00:53:03.700" style="s2">everyday because everyone else doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.200" end="00:53:05.140" style="s2">need to commit to an hour but basically</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.700" end="00:53:08.020" style="s2">we&#39;re just gonna host a revolution</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.140" end="00:53:09.340" style="s2">during an hour a day so you can show up</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.020" end="00:53:11.050" style="s2">and be part of the revolution for an</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.340" end="00:53:12.550" style="s2">hour you can miss a few days once</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.050" end="00:53:14.680" style="s2">there&#39;s somebody who&#39;s able to take</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.550" end="00:53:16.120" style="s2">notes and able to say because this is</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.680" end="00:53:18.070" style="s2">don&#39;t take notes right now this is just</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.120" end="00:53:19.300" style="s2">me rambling for an hour well we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.070" end="00:53:20.980" style="s2">trying to figure out like what does this</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.300" end="00:53:22.570" style="s2">look like how can we actually create a</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.980" end="00:53:26.740" style="s2">better world together during these this</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.570" end="00:53:28.510" style="s2">hour every day it&#39;s its solution raising</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.740" end="00:53:29.920" style="s2">is how but it&#39;s like once we have the</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.510" end="00:53:31.450" style="s2">idea during the hour how do we move</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.920" end="00:53:34.060" style="s2">forward with it how do we have more than</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.450" end="00:53:35.680" style="s2">five people participate and have dozens</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.060" end="00:53:37.750" style="s2">and hundreds of people participate I</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.680" end="00:53:39.310" style="s2">have ideas for all of that but unless we</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.750" end="00:53:41.290" style="s2">generate it together there isn&#39;t going</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.310" end="00:53:43.210" style="s2">to be the the energy and ingenuity</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.290" end="00:53:45.400" style="s2">behind it to actually put it into place</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.210" end="00:53:46.960" style="s2">and that is the point is coming up with</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.400" end="00:53:48.940" style="s2">solutions together we have the energy</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.960" end="00:53:50.650" style="s2">together we have the will of if you have</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.940" end="00:53:52.720" style="s2">10,000 people co-creating a solution</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.650" end="00:53:54.010" style="s2">it&#39;s not going to work for all 10,000 of</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.720" end="00:53:55.540" style="s2">them but if you can figure out a</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.010" end="00:53:59.980" style="s2">solution that works for nine thousand up</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.540" end="00:54:02.920" style="s2">to ten thousand and then you can invite</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.980" end="00:54:04.780" style="s2">the world and 90% of the world will be</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.920" end="00:54:06.190" style="s2">benefited by coming and the 10% that</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.780" end="00:54:07.420" style="s2">isn&#39;t benefit and can find a new</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.190" end="00:54:09.820" style="s2">solution that works for them and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.420" end="00:54:12.700" style="s2">able to find 7,000 people and we were</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.820" end="00:54:14.200" style="s2">able to work through how envisioning it</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.700" end="00:54:17.380" style="s2">right now is something like a contest</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.200" end="00:54:18.850" style="s2">that the payoff is that you get to</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.380" end="00:54:20.620" style="s2">participate in the contest which there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.850" end="00:54:22.270" style="s2">tons of right like I mean people pay to</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.620" end="00:54:25.590" style="s2">be part of a scavenger hunt to the city</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.270" end="00:54:28.570" style="s2">or to be part of a coating for good good</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.590" end="00:54:30.850" style="s2">campaign and so the idea is anyone can</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.570" end="00:54:34.090" style="s2">participate what does that look like and</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.850" end="00:54:35.620" style="s2">it looks like 10,000 people this is</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.090" end="00:54:36.940" style="s2">again my vision we haven&#39;t come up with</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.620" end="00:54:38.380" style="s2">it together yet but</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.940" end="00:54:41.290" style="s2">and thousand people who are contributing</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.380" end="00:54:43.089" style="s2">money to the problem and contributing</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.290" end="00:54:44.980" style="s2">votes unlike what they would like and</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.089" end="00:54:46.510" style="s2">not like in it but they&#39;re not probably</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.980" end="00:54:48.550" style="s2">part of the conversation they&#39;re like at</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.510" end="00:54:50.740" style="s2">the very big periphery of those 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.550" end="00:54:53.109" style="s2">maybe a thousand people are having the</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.740" end="00:54:54.430" style="s2">actual conversation if 10,000 people</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.109" end="00:54:56.230" style="s2">want to have the conversation we need to</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.430" end="00:54:57.609" style="s2">make it for 10,000 people but the point</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.230" end="00:54:58.900" style="s2">is to meet people where they are and not</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.609" end="00:55:01.270" style="s2">force anyone to do what they don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.900" end="00:55:02.920" style="s2">to do so just give him ten dollars to</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.270" end="00:55:04.329" style="s2">the cause is more than enough just</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.920" end="00:55:08.410" style="s2">voting on things so we know we&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.329" end="00:55:09.460" style="s2">it for you is enough then you have the</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.410" end="00:55:11.230" style="s2">people having the actual very</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.460" end="00:55:13.060" style="s2">conversation then you have maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.230" end="00:55:14.920" style="s2">hundred people doing more work doing the</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.060" end="00:55:16.770" style="s2">organizing doing the facilitation and</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.920" end="00:55:18.550" style="s2">doing in each individual one and</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.770" end="00:55:19.510" style="s2">communicating what would make it easier</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.550" end="00:55:21.010" style="s2">and what would make it better and then</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.510" end="00:55:23.650" style="s2">you have maybe ten people out of that</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.010" end="00:55:25.869" style="s2">10,000 working full time being the board</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.650" end="00:55:27.910" style="s2">of directors moving it forward and that</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.869" end="00:55:30.220" style="s2">is what I want to do online it is like</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.910" end="00:55:32.619" style="s2">that piece is having the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.220" end="00:55:36.099" style="s2">with other people who can see the</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.619" end="00:55:37.839" style="s2">potential in solution raising and how</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.099" end="00:55:40.540" style="s2">can humanity come together and create</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.839" end="00:55:42.849" style="s2">solutions that we want to be part of we</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.540" end="00:55:44.950" style="s2">want to have and again we came up with</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.849" end="00:55:47.770" style="s2">six different ones using the six hours</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.950" end="00:55:49.750" style="s2">that if I would sign I would give $10 to</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.770" end="00:55:51.220" style="s2">a month to each and every one of these</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.750" end="00:55:53.950" style="s2">causes and that&#39;s not even a model the</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.220" end="00:55:56.050" style="s2">model is to give $10 to it one time to</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.950" end="00:55:58.960" style="s2">create $100,000 some of them might need</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.050" end="00:56:01.780" style="s2">$10 one and we&#39;ll figure that out let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.960" end="00:56:03.970" style="s2">do that part like education right now</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.780" end="00:56:06.069" style="s2">again this was a pre kovin world where</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.970" end="00:56:08.890" style="s2">we came up the education one but if we</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.069" end="00:56:10.750" style="s2">had the possibility of anything you want</p>
