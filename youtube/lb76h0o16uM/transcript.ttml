<p begin="00:00:13.130" end="00:00:19.970" style="s2">commentary on one of my essays my recent</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.910" end="00:00:25.310" style="s2">medium essay called Jordan Peterson sex</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.970" end="00:00:29.749" style="s2">and patriarchy so Jordan Peterson is</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.310" end="00:00:33.460" style="s2">criticized and attacked for equating</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.749" end="00:00:38.090" style="s2">let&#39;s say the feminine principle or</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.460" end="00:00:42.970" style="s2">femininity with chaos right and the</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.090" end="00:00:47.600" style="s2">masculine or masculinity has order</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.970" end="00:00:51.440" style="s2">this may seem chauvinistic to people in</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.600" end="00:00:55.370" style="s2">our post feminist age even if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.440" end="00:00:56.800" style="s2">nothing particularly wrong with chaos in</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.370" end="00:00:59.440" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.800" end="00:01:02.540" style="s2">Peterson knows that women have been</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.440" end="00:01:04.640" style="s2">symbolically associated with positive</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.540" end="00:01:09.260" style="s2">qualities as well of course like soul</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.640" end="00:01:15.380" style="s2">psyche wisdom energy beauty compassion</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.260" end="00:01:19.250" style="s2">etc so I&#39;d like to offer a remedy to</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.380" end="00:01:24.110" style="s2">this conceptual confusion to this</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.250" end="00:01:28.760" style="s2">difficulty so if we say that the male</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.110" end="00:01:30.740" style="s2">principle is consciousness then what if</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.760" end="00:01:35.680" style="s2">we say that the female principle is</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.740" end="00:01:38.150" style="s2">being so what the hell do I mean by this</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.680" end="00:01:42.280" style="s2">well-being is everything that is that</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.150" end="00:01:47.500" style="s2">exists that is alive that is embodied</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.280" end="00:01:47.500" style="s2">being is the world of form</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.610" end="00:01:56.610" style="s2">this helps us to give equal symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.720" end="00:01:59.070" style="s2">weight and gravity to the masculine and</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.610" end="00:02:01.229" style="s2">feminine consciousness and being arise</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.070" end="00:02:03.360" style="s2">together they are complementary the</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.229" end="00:02:07.110" style="s2">masculine feminine are complementary</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.360" end="00:02:09.780" style="s2">they should have equal power and</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.110" end="00:02:15.000" style="s2">symbolically and they always have</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.780" end="00:02:16.880" style="s2">traditionally I will argue so</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.000" end="00:02:21.209" style="s2">symbolically consciousness is always</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.880" end="00:02:23.970" style="s2">higher it&#39;s in the head right but higher</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.209" end="00:02:28.860" style="s2">doesn&#39;t always have to be greater or</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.970" end="00:02:34.730" style="s2">better the belly in the end the Chinese</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.860" end="00:02:37.200" style="s2">systems of the dawn Chen is you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.730" end="00:02:39.840" style="s2">symbolically speaking we&#39;re being is</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.200" end="00:02:44.549" style="s2">it&#39;s in in the belly your being is in</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.840" end="00:02:50.220" style="s2">your belly so to speak your anchor for</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.549" end="00:02:52.410" style="s2">life so the earth therefore uh-huh is in</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.220" end="00:02:56.549" style="s2">the belly and the feminine is always</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.410" end="00:02:58.799" style="s2">associated with the earth so where do</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.549" end="00:03:00.989" style="s2">the masculine and the feminine meet they</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.799" end="00:03:03.239" style="s2">meet in the heart they meet between</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.989" end="00:03:09.120" style="s2">consciousness and being in that central</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.239" end="00:03:12.269" style="s2">location which is always in the heart so</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.120" end="00:03:13.370" style="s2">everybody has a head and everybody has a</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.269" end="00:03:17.630" style="s2">belly</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.370" end="00:03:21.320" style="s2">everybody has consciousness and being</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.630" end="00:03:26.489" style="s2">everybody has masculine and feminine</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.320" end="00:03:28.859" style="s2">qualities in a man</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.489" end="00:03:32.160" style="s2">the masculine qualities are usually</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.859" end="00:03:36.049" style="s2">dominant obviously right whereas in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.160" end="00:03:40.560" style="s2">woman the feminine is usually dominant</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.049" end="00:03:44.900" style="s2">not always there are some men who have</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.560" end="00:03:44.900" style="s2">very powerful feminine</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.750" end="00:03:51.560" style="s2">qualities and there&#39;s some women who</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.610" end="00:03:55.220" style="s2">have obviously very strong masculine</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.560" end="00:03:59.390" style="s2">qualities so nobody is in an absolute</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.220" end="00:04:01.730" style="s2">sense fully male or female right except</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.390" end="00:04:05.060" style="s2">on the in the most superficial way right</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.730" end="00:04:07.310" style="s2">we a man has a penis therefore he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.060" end="00:04:10.370" style="s2">man a woman has a vagina and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.310" end="00:04:14.840" style="s2">she&#39;s a woman but we&#39;re not talking</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.370" end="00:04:19.639" style="s2">about exterior plumbing we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.840" end="00:04:25.010" style="s2">about essential qualities archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.639" end="00:04:30.410" style="s2">qualities and one of the problems with</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.010" end="00:04:33.080" style="s2">let&#39;s say post-modernism is that it</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.410" end="00:04:36.320" style="s2">doesn&#39;t acknowledge these qualities it</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.080" end="00:04:38.840" style="s2">doesn&#39;t acknowledge these differences it</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.320" end="00:04:42.669" style="s2">wants to flatten out all heart</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.840" end="00:04:42.669" style="s2">hierarchies to make this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.000" end="00:04:50.960" style="s2">sameness so yes there&#39;s a spectrum I</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.720" end="00:04:58.160" style="s2">would say there&#39;s a spectrum of male and</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.960" end="00:05:00.250" style="s2">female obviously and that&#39;s fine but</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.160" end="00:05:04.190" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean that male and female</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.250" end="00:05:06.740" style="s2">masculine and feminine literally and</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.190" end="00:05:08.860" style="s2">symbolically do not exist that would be</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.740" end="00:05:08.860" style="s2">absurd</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.020" end="00:05:19.010" style="s2">so Peterson also gets criticized for</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.590" end="00:05:21.050" style="s2">being somewhat of a patriarchy right for</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.010" end="00:05:23.330" style="s2">ik weighting masculinity with this</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.050" end="00:05:29.570" style="s2">higher principle and feminine iing with</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.330" end="00:05:31.210" style="s2">this lower principle and I suppose you</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.570" end="00:05:36.580" style="s2">could understand why feminists would be</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.210" end="00:05:36.580" style="s2">upset by this but</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.819" end="00:05:44.240" style="s2">let&#39;s look at it in a different way so</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.969" end="00:05:49.219" style="s2">the patriarchy you know in the most</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.240" end="00:05:54.379" style="s2">let&#39;s say politicized manner means has</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.219" end="00:05:56.560" style="s2">been co-opted to mean right that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.379" end="00:05:59.719" style="s2">this sort of world that where men are</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.560" end="00:06:02.900" style="s2">our dominance and and treat women as</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.719" end="00:06:06.379" style="s2">chattel and and that it&#39;s been like that</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.900" end="00:06:09.650" style="s2">through history and in 1960 there was</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.379" end="00:06:12.849" style="s2">this amazing liberation and which which</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.650" end="00:06:17.240" style="s2">continues today</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.849" end="00:06:21.199" style="s2">however I&#39;d say that&#39;s a political</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.240" end="00:06:24.139" style="s2">narrow ideological use and understanding</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.199" end="00:06:25.939" style="s2">of the word patriarchy the patriarchy</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.139" end="00:06:29.930" style="s2">has become this word has become a</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.939" end="00:06:32.449" style="s2">misnomer and it denigrates actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.930" end="00:06:36.699" style="s2">women it denigrates the secret powers</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.449" end="00:06:39.860" style="s2">that women have always had even if</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.699" end="00:06:45.129" style="s2">social and political you know rights are</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.860" end="00:06:45.129" style="s2">a rather recent development for women</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.960" end="00:06:53.270" style="s2">masculine power is not all bad right</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.839" end="00:06:55.490" style="s2">just as feminine power is not all</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.270" end="00:06:59.750" style="s2">sweetness and light so we need to</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.490" end="00:07:01.520" style="s2">understand that the benefits the</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.750" end="00:07:03.800" style="s2">positive qualities of masculinity and</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.520" end="00:07:06.490" style="s2">femininity as well as their shadow</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.800" end="00:07:10.550" style="s2">aspects as well as their deeper darker</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.490" end="00:07:15.770" style="s2">aspects and we also have to understand</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.550" end="00:07:17.569" style="s2">the historical development of the father</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.770" end="00:07:21.589" style="s2">lineage of the patriarchy and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.569" end="00:07:24.949" style="s2">matriarchy the the maternal lineage the</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.589" end="00:07:28.699" style="s2">maternal lineage from let&#39;s say mother</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.949" end="00:07:31.539" style="s2">to daughter and patrilineal lineage from</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.699" end="00:07:31.539" style="s2">father to son</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.520" end="00:07:41.890" style="s2">so it&#39;s not that controversial to say</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.010" end="00:07:44.860" style="s2">that in the West right</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.890" end="00:07:49.240" style="s2">we have repressed the feminine</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.860" end="00:07:52.990" style="s2">archetypes throughout history and we</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.240" end="00:07:57.220" style="s2">have infantilized and idealized women</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.990" end="00:07:59.650" style="s2">and done a lot worse however what&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.220" end="00:08:02.200" style="s2">difficult to say and is a much more</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.650" end="00:08:05.160" style="s2">subtle point and it&#39;s especially</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.200" end="00:08:08.950" style="s2">difficult to say in the age of me too is</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.160" end="00:08:12.280" style="s2">that ironically Western patriarchy which</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.950" end="00:08:16.150" style="s2">means a world that is dominated right by</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.280" end="00:08:23.470" style="s2">figures masculine figures and science</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.150" end="00:08:25.930" style="s2">religion and philosophy this has also a</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.470" end="00:08:29.290" style="s2">lot for the conditions for some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.930" end="00:08:30.970" style="s2">emancipation of women to be possible so</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.290" end="00:08:33.790" style="s2">this is a controversial statement of</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.970" end="00:08:36.310" style="s2">course but the patriarchy has also</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.790" end="00:08:38.800" style="s2">contributed to women&#39;s liberation and</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.310" end="00:08:42.099" style="s2">made possible social emancipation of</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.800" end="00:08:47.200" style="s2">women to a certain extent you just have</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.099" end="00:08:51.880" style="s2">to look at birth control to get this</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.200" end="00:08:54.460" style="s2">point so don&#39;t get me wrong here I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.880" end="00:08:57.010" style="s2">denying the historical oppression of</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.460" end="00:08:59.500" style="s2">women right and I&#39;m all for equal</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.010" end="00:09:00.910" style="s2">opportunity however we have to</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.500" end="00:09:02.970" style="s2">acknowledge a positive male</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.910" end="00:09:07.030" style="s2">consciousness that has always existed</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.970" end="00:09:08.830" style="s2">just has negative women archetypes have</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.030" end="00:09:16.410" style="s2">always existed in India you have this</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.830" end="00:09:22.690" style="s2">image of Kali somehow the Christian West</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.410" end="00:09:28.330" style="s2">seems to have tried to let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.690" end="00:09:34.450" style="s2">sanitize the feminine archetype</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.330" end="00:09:44.110" style="s2">make it benevolent and soft and all of</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.450" end="00:09:46.450" style="s2">these let&#39;s say cliche feminine traits</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.110" end="00:09:49.330" style="s2">like softness and but there&#39;s also a</p>

<p begin="00:25:17.860" end="00:25:22.060" style="s2">and the patriarchy there&#39;s a certain</p>

<p begin="00:25:22.060" end="00:25:32.080" style="s2">obviously so the the matriarchy you know</p>

<p begin="00:31:11.390" end="00:31:20.120" style="s2">got go I wrote this essay called fifth</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.530" end="00:31:22.130" style="s2">wave feminism which was a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.120" end="00:31:26.510" style="s2">tongue-in-cheek it was a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.130" end="00:31:29.059" style="s2">polemic but it suggested that women</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.510" end="00:31:33.290" style="s2">focused less on the victimology and more</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.059" end="00:31:35.660" style="s2">on their strengths as women and that we</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.290" end="00:31:39.740" style="s2">do need to yes</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.660" end="00:31:41.750" style="s2">integrate the positive aspects of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.740" end="00:31:44.900" style="s2">matriarchy the mother called the</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.750" end="00:31:50.660" style="s2">matrilineal lineage with its positive</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.900" end="00:31:54.260" style="s2">values of community and subsistence but</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.660" end="00:31:58.640" style="s2">also we need to celebrate male virility</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.260" end="00:32:02.960" style="s2">and creativity but this is a this is</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.640" end="00:32:06.020" style="s2">important right and if we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.960" end="00:32:10.490" style="s2">celebrating female wisdom and compassion</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.020" end="00:32:14.720" style="s2">and softness and community values and</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.490" end="00:32:16.820" style="s2">all that you know hmm if we want to</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.720" end="00:32:18.830" style="s2">throw the the patriarchy you know out</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.820" end="00:32:20.540" style="s2">the window you know we&#39;re just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.830" end="00:32:22.760" style="s2">we&#39;re just we&#39;re just get it it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.540" end="00:32:30.169" style="s2">get up we&#39;re just gonna create more and</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.760" end="00:32:35.480" style="s2">more boring culture wars and Wars of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.169" end="00:32:38.870" style="s2">sexes so the feminists I believe need to</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.480" end="00:32:41.809" style="s2">acknowledge the shadow of femininity</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.870" end="00:32:44.090" style="s2">just as as males need to acknowledge</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.809" end="00:32:46.520" style="s2">their own you know danger dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.090" end="00:32:48.320" style="s2">aspects of masculinity because</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.520" end="00:32:53.600" style="s2">masculinity is obviously quite dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.320" end="00:32:56.960" style="s2">and we need to be conscious of both</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.600" end="00:32:59.179" style="s2">poles that and rather than have an</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.960" end="00:33:05.480" style="s2">unconscious patriarchy or an unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.179" end="00:33:08.240" style="s2">matriarchy that the matriarchy needs to</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.480" end="00:33:10.130" style="s2">become unconscious and the the</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.240" end="00:33:11.570" style="s2">patriarchy needs to become conscious and</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.130" end="00:33:13.730" style="s2">the two need to come together and</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.570" end="00:33:17.360" style="s2">transcend themselves so to speak that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.730" end="00:33:19.730" style="s2">sort of my vision and that&#39;s the vision</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.360" end="00:33:20.570" style="s2">of waking up from what James Joyce</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.730" end="00:33:23.210" style="s2">called the nightmare</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.570" end="00:33:25.340" style="s2">of history and the night merit mayor of</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.210" end="00:33:30.320" style="s2">history is the separation is this primal</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.340" end="00:33:35.019" style="s2">separation of man and women it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.320" end="00:33:35.019" style="s2">it&#39;s this that&#39;s what the fall is right</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.710" end="00:33:45.049" style="s2">it&#39;s this intense separatism so we have</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.679" end="00:33:47.870" style="s2">to make the father lineage and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.049" end="00:33:51.710" style="s2">mother lineage conscious and go beyond</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.870" end="00:33:55.330" style="s2">this adolescent whining stage of</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.710" end="00:33:58.669" style="s2">victimology that&#39;s what I think anyway</p>
