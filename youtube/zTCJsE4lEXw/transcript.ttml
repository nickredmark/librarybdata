<p begin="00:00:02.909" end="00:00:11.290" style="s2">collective subconscious rage that is</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.030" end="00:00:13.509" style="s2">just boiling in women and it&#39;s coming up</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.290" end="00:00:16.830" style="s2">in so many ways we see we see in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.509" end="00:00:20.920" style="s2">media and and what&#39;s going on is this</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.830" end="00:00:21.550" style="s2">unknown rage that comes up in in many</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.920" end="00:00:26.470" style="s2">different ways</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.550" end="00:00:29.170" style="s2">um and on one hand it needs to come out</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.470" end="00:00:31.600" style="s2">we need to clear it it needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.170" end="00:00:35.050" style="s2">expressed it needs to be acknowledged on</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.600" end="00:00:38.589" style="s2">the other hand it&#39;s not enough this is</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.050" end="00:00:42.129" style="s2">only like this is breaking the ice so</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.589" end="00:00:44.559" style="s2">that the next step of evolution can you</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.129" end="00:00:46.390" style="s2">know consciousness can start coming</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.559" end="00:00:49.390" style="s2">through and that&#39;s what I&#39;m lacking in</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.390" end="00:00:52.469" style="s2">women it&#39;s really to take responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.390" end="00:00:55.690" style="s2">for what we do as women in our</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.469" end="00:00:59.920" style="s2">manipulation in our seduction in our</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.690" end="00:01:01.839" style="s2">control and and it&#39;s so easy for women</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.920" end="00:01:03.850" style="s2">to say but that&#39;s just because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.839" end="00:01:06.659" style="s2">angry and men did this and patriarchy</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.850" end="00:01:09.549" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s such a lack of</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.659" end="00:01:11.680" style="s2">responsibility and this women really</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.549" end="00:01:14.079" style="s2">need to know because we could say we</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.680" end="00:01:15.820" style="s2">could look at say me too which has been</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.079" end="00:01:19.950" style="s2">kind of ongoing for a long time and as</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.820" end="00:01:22.750" style="s2">still a massive force and we can say</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.950" end="00:01:24.430" style="s2">that it&#39;s it&#39;s brought up a lot of male</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.750" end="00:01:26.950" style="s2">shadows it&#39;s brought showing up a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.430" end="00:01:31.149" style="s2">male behavior that is just inexcusable</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.950" end="00:01:32.680" style="s2">should not happen and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.149" end="00:01:34.990" style="s2">certainly you could say started as a</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.680" end="00:01:37.689" style="s2">positive thing but then you also have</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.990" end="00:01:39.009" style="s2">like there&#39;s there&#39;s perhaps a danger of</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.689" end="00:01:42.310" style="s2">it&#39;s slipping into a very simplistic</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.009" end="00:01:44.920" style="s2">narrative of men as only aggressors</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.310" end="00:01:47.289" style="s2">women as only victims is that something</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.920" end="00:01:49.149" style="s2">that you&#39;re worried about I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.289" end="00:01:52.060" style="s2">worried about that because what it feels</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.149" end="00:01:54.780" style="s2">like is it has displayed the male shadow</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.060" end="00:01:58.960" style="s2">but who talks about the female shadow</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.780" end="00:02:01.780" style="s2">the rage that that women are expressing</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.960" end="00:02:04.210" style="s2">blindly and projecting onto which ever</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.780" end="00:02:07.929" style="s2">situation and whichever men that they</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.210" end="00:02:10.629" style="s2">can this is this is where women need to</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.929" end="00:02:13.230" style="s2">step up and take responsibility and stop</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.629" end="00:02:16.170" style="s2">blaming men it&#39;s pointless</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.230" end="00:02:18.239" style="s2">we need to transcend this we can&#39;t solve</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.170" end="00:02:20.400" style="s2">this we can&#39;t solve this problem from</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.239" end="00:02:24.030" style="s2">the steps from the same level we need to</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.400" end="00:02:26.519" style="s2">transcend and look at how am i adding to</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.030" end="00:02:29.220" style="s2">this dynamic as a woman because we are</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.519" end="00:02:32.940" style="s2">we are co-creating it in perfect harmony</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.220" end="00:02:34.890" style="s2">if women are angry we absolutely need to</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.940" end="00:02:36.930" style="s2">take responsibility for getting</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.890" end="00:02:39.630" style="s2">ourselves to another place I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.930" end="00:02:41.760" style="s2">the the kind of shadow work is the</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.630" end="00:02:43.799" style="s2">acceptance that we all have shadows that</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.760" end="00:02:46.380" style="s2">men certainly have a shadow there is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.799" end="00:02:48.230" style="s2">shadow around masculinity but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.380" end="00:02:51.390" style="s2">also a shadow around femininity and</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.230" end="00:02:53.790" style="s2">while part of the cultural conversation</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.390" end="00:02:55.140" style="s2">now is toxic masculinity and everyone</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.790" end="00:02:58.410" style="s2">knows what you mean by toxic toxic</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.140" end="00:03:00.930" style="s2">masculinity if you talk about toxic</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.410" end="00:03:02.400" style="s2">femininity everyone still knows what you</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.930" end="00:03:04.890" style="s2">mean but you can&#39;t have that</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.400" end="00:03:06.900" style="s2">conversation which is it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.890" end="00:03:08.579" style="s2">interesting what is allowed to be said</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.900" end="00:03:11.760" style="s2">and what is not allowed to be said at</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.579" end="00:03:16.260" style="s2">the moment and that Dad I think is is</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.760" end="00:03:18.540" style="s2">very dangerous that certain topics</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.260" end="00:03:21.030" style="s2">certain conversations are off are</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.540" end="00:03:23.400" style="s2">off-limits and this is where we see</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.030" end="00:03:25.739" style="s2">where we see the victim persecutor</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.400" end="00:03:28.590" style="s2">dynamics activates it because women</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.739" end="00:03:30.870" style="s2">become the become the victims and we</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.590" end="00:03:33.450" style="s2">make ourselves the victims and we</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.870" end="00:03:35.430" style="s2">persecute men but in that aggression in</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.450" end="00:03:38.790" style="s2">that reach and when we are the victims</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.430" end="00:03:42.660" style="s2">we are in perfect control we become the</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.790" end="00:03:46.230" style="s2">persecutors because we say it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.660" end="00:03:48.840" style="s2">about blame men did this and men need to</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.230" end="00:03:51.030" style="s2">take responsibility but in that we</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.840" end="00:03:54.120" style="s2">become the persecutors it&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.030" end="00:03:56.910" style="s2">problem with the media because the short</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.120" end="00:03:59.340" style="s2">attention span of the media wants to</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.910" end="00:04:01.590" style="s2">polarize things and it&#39;s a very is</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.340" end="00:04:03.480" style="s2">therefore very easy like it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.590" end="00:04:06.739" style="s2">straightforward narrative victim</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.480" end="00:04:09.359" style="s2">perpetrated and yet the true dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.739" end="00:04:13.319" style="s2">needs something more than just a very</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.359" end="00:04:14.819" style="s2">short analysis or a soundbite it needs</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.319" end="00:04:16.889" style="s2">to be unpacked over time and it needs to</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.819" end="00:04:18.299" style="s2">be it&#39;s easily taken out of context</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.889" end="00:04:20.190" style="s2">which is why it&#39;s such a hot potato for</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.299" end="00:04:24.060" style="s2">the media to handle I think it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.190" end="00:04:24.930" style="s2">it&#39;s a very very old story about you</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.060" end="00:04:27.919" style="s2">cannot say</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.930" end="00:04:30.060" style="s2">to a woman in the public debate take</p>

<p begin="00:04:34.500" end="00:04:38.400" style="s2">to talk for a moment about the</p>

<p begin="00:05:46.470" end="00:05:51.000" style="s2">really need to have this conversation in</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.389" end="00:05:55.889" style="s2">a balanced way mmm because I started</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.000" end="00:06:01.620" style="s2">teaching men&#39;s work maybe a year ago or</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.889" end="00:06:03.470" style="s2">so and the REE the biggest reason for</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.620" end="00:06:06.090" style="s2">that was I could see a need for it</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.470" end="00:06:08.639" style="s2">individually and among a lot of the men</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.090" end="00:06:10.409" style="s2">that I know but also because culturally</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.639" end="00:06:12.810" style="s2">it just felt like this was a time when</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.409" end="00:06:15.539" style="s2">men were being challenged to step up to</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.810" end="00:06:17.789" style="s2">evolve as men to integrate our shadows</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.539" end="00:06:19.530" style="s2">to kind of to be confronted with sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.789" end="00:06:23.280" style="s2">the negative traits of masculinity and</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.530" end="00:06:24.990" style="s2">to integrate them and move forward but I</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.280" end="00:06:27.240" style="s2">know that some people might look at</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.990" end="00:06:28.800" style="s2">men&#39;s work and say oh it&#39;s divisive what</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.240" end="00:06:32.250" style="s2">you&#39;re doing is kind of perpetuating the</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.800" end="00:06:35.159" style="s2">patriarchy for example what do you think</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.250" end="00:06:37.409" style="s2">of that as a criticism it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.159" end="00:06:40.080" style="s2">really good question because</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.409" end="00:06:44.249" style="s2">in my experience when I when I work with</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.080" end="00:06:46.969" style="s2">men and women for me it&#39;s very obvious</p>

<p begin="00:06:46.969" end="00:06:53.669" style="s2">self-development and to to to go in deep</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.639" end="00:06:57.839" style="s2">emotionally in themselves where I feel</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.669" end="00:07:00.179" style="s2">men Imoh vague or not as on it and it</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.839" end="00:07:03.059" style="s2">might be that I&#39;m a woman and that men</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.179" end="00:07:05.939" style="s2">want more more kind of safe environment</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.059" end="00:07:08.399" style="s2">when where there&#39;s only men to do that</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.939" end="00:07:12.569" style="s2">but I feel that men have been somehow</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.399" end="00:07:14.399" style="s2">lacking in in really engaging with their</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.569" end="00:07:16.619" style="s2">own personal development really taking</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.399" end="00:07:18.689" style="s2">responsibility for for their belief</p>

<p begin="00:07:18.689" end="00:07:25.619" style="s2">for how they show up in the world</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.309" end="00:07:28.739" style="s2">and in my work I feel that I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.619" end="00:07:30.719" style="s2">deep in womanhood what does it mean to</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.739" end="00:07:32.849" style="s2">be a woman this is what interests me</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.719" end="00:07:36.989" style="s2">this is what I&#39;m passionate about it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.849" end="00:07:40.289" style="s2">it&#39;s about the deep feminine and women</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.989" end="00:07:42.419" style="s2">are drawn to that so many women come to</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.289" end="00:07:44.550" style="s2">me and say thank you for showing up in</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.419" end="00:07:47.429" style="s2">the world like this now I&#39;m getting a</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.550" end="00:07:50.129" style="s2">sense of something that hasn&#39;t I I</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.429" end="00:07:52.110" style="s2">haven&#39;t had it modeled you know in my</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.129" end="00:07:54.179" style="s2">therapy practice we talk a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.110" end="00:07:57.839" style="s2">childhood and how are your parents and</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.179" end="00:08:01.079" style="s2">and so few women have had muddled a</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.839" end="00:08:01.919" style="s2">healthy feminine so that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.079" end="00:08:05.219" style="s2">passionate about</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.919" end="00:08:06.779" style="s2">but in that work I feel I&#39;ve gotten to a</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.219" end="00:08:10.709" style="s2">point in my life where I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.779" end="00:08:12.539" style="s2">where&#39;s men I don&#39;t know about men I</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.709" end="00:08:13.589" style="s2">don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on for them I</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.539" end="00:08:15.179" style="s2">can&#39;t feel them</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.589" end="00:08:17.399" style="s2">I don&#39;t feel they&#39;re showing up I know</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.179" end="00:08:22.559" style="s2">I&#39;m talking very general but this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.399" end="00:08:25.860" style="s2">what I feel it&#39;s a lack a lack of</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.559" end="00:08:28.949" style="s2">willingness to show up with a woman that</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.860" end="00:08:31.110" style="s2">is present and this is what I&#39;m missing</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.949" end="00:08:34.800" style="s2">this is why I feel men&#39;s work is so</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.110" end="00:08:37.079" style="s2">important because women are trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.800" end="00:08:40.800" style="s2">their work and there&#39;s a lot to do still</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.079" end="00:08:43.769" style="s2">I really want to admit that but men need</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.800" end="00:08:46.860" style="s2">to show up and right now there&#39;s one man</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.769" end="00:08:49.769" style="s2">here and one men there but most men out</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.860" end="00:08:51.070" style="s2">there are boys still and I&#39;m sad to say</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.769" end="00:08:54.250" style="s2">it but I feel and</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.070" end="00:08:55.570" style="s2">women are girls so we&#39;re both sides we</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.250" end="00:08:57.250" style="s2">have so much work to do</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.570" end="00:08:59.170" style="s2">I&#39;d always found men&#39;s work really</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.250" end="00:09:00.460" style="s2">helpful I&#39;ve done a lot of self</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.170" end="00:09:02.770" style="s2">development work but what I really found</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.460" end="00:09:05.200" style="s2">with the men&#39;s work was that landing in</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.770" end="00:09:07.720" style="s2">my masculinity landing with other men</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.200" end="00:09:09.700" style="s2">feeling comfortable in in myself around</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.720" end="00:09:12.280" style="s2">other men healing those wounds then</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.700" end="00:09:13.960" style="s2">really allowed me to meet women on a</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.280" end="00:09:15.970" style="s2">much more from a much more grounded</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.960" end="00:09:17.800" style="s2">place and I found my relationships with</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.970" end="00:09:21.160" style="s2">women improving with the amount of men&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.800" end="00:09:22.870" style="s2">work that I&#39;ve been doing and so I</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.160" end="00:09:24.250" style="s2">really wanted to start leading men&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.870" end="00:09:28.150" style="s2">work and bring that kind of work to</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.250" end="00:09:29.170" style="s2">other men and then my background as a</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.150" end="00:09:31.210" style="s2">journalist I&#39;ve always been very</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.170" end="00:09:33.670" style="s2">interested in in kind of following the</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.210" end="00:09:37.360" style="s2">media and then I saw those same dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.670" end="00:09:39.310" style="s2">playing out in the political sphere the</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.360" end="00:09:42.760" style="s2">Trump Hillary election was just so</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.310" end="00:09:44.560" style="s2">clearly from my perspective that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.760" end="00:09:48.370" style="s2">so desperate for genuine masculine</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.560" end="00:09:51.400" style="s2">values and so missing them that somehow</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.370" end="00:09:53.830" style="s2">some strange caricature and facsimile of</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.400" end="00:09:56.140" style="s2">genuine masculine values people are</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.830" end="00:09:59.860" style="s2">voting for and suddenly this guy who&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.140" end="00:10:02.410" style="s2">boy pretending to be a man is the most</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.860" end="00:10:06.100" style="s2">powerful man in the world so these these</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.410" end="00:10:08.140" style="s2">these dynamics are playing out in all of</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.100" end="00:10:10.570" style="s2">our lives and then on the wider scale</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.140" end="00:10:12.430" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s quite astonishing to see that</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.570" end="00:10:14.110" style="s2">I think that there was perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.430" end="00:10:16.840" style="s2">highlighting the sickness of</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.110" end="00:10:20.190" style="s2">post-modernism that we have completely</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.840" end="00:10:23.860" style="s2">we have we needed to smash the values so</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.190" end="00:10:26.530" style="s2">post-modernism is is is a good thing but</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.860" end="00:10:29.050" style="s2">we cannot stay there we&#39;ve smashed the</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.530" end="00:10:31.210" style="s2">values no one knows what it is to be a</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.050" end="00:10:34.630" style="s2">man and no one knows what it is to be a</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.210" end="00:10:36.160" style="s2">woman and we see these caricatures we</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.630" end="00:10:37.840" style="s2">see someone stepping up and doing</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.160" end="00:10:40.830" style="s2">something oh let&#39;s go that way because</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.840" end="00:10:44.230" style="s2">we&#39;ve lost ground men have lost ground</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.830" end="00:10:47.140" style="s2">women have lost ground we&#39;re calling for</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.230" end="00:10:47.680" style="s2">a more empowered feminine that&#39;s like in</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.140" end="00:10:50.590" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.680" end="00:10:52.660" style="s2">Oh patriarchy now we need to call in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.590" end="00:10:56.290" style="s2">deep feminine but what about the</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.660" end="00:10:59.230" style="s2">masculine we see an absolute caricature</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.290" end="00:11:03.070" style="s2">of a man being so powerful in the world</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.230" end="00:11:05.020" style="s2">because it&#39;s exactly where we are if we</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.070" end="00:11:06.970" style="s2">don&#39;t change this is what we get so</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.020" end="00:11:09.610" style="s2">we&#39;re getting it&#39;s a very very healthy</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.970" end="00:11:11.830" style="s2">lesson for the world to see if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.610" end="00:11:13.780" style="s2">start changing this is our future we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.830" end="00:11:14.680" style="s2">arrived to that future what are we going</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.780" end="00:11:16.750" style="s2">to do about that</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.680" end="00:11:19.240" style="s2">and also I think it&#39;s important to say</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.750" end="00:11:20.710" style="s2">that what I&#39;m talking about and I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.240" end="00:11:22.420" style="s2">you can tell me if it&#39;s what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.710" end="00:11:26.230" style="s2">talking about as well it&#39;s not about</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.420" end="00:11:28.960" style="s2">going back to the old masculine feminine</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.230" end="00:11:30.910" style="s2">dynamics it not it&#39;s not saying men have</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.960" end="00:11:33.010" style="s2">to be stereotypically masculine women</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.910" end="00:11:35.080" style="s2">have to be stereotypically feminine it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.010" end="00:11:38.230" style="s2">going through this kind of gender</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.080" end="00:11:41.440" style="s2">neutral space and re embracing this sort</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.230" end="00:11:42.730" style="s2">of our feminine and masculine essence</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.440" end="00:11:44.260" style="s2">and playing those roles out more</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.730" end="00:11:46.930" style="s2">consciously for me it&#39;s like an</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.260" end="00:11:49.600" style="s2">evolutionary step I absolutely agree we</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.930" end="00:11:52.390" style="s2">need to go through this we need to to</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.600" end="00:11:55.060" style="s2">pull everything apart but we need to put</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.390" end="00:11:59.530" style="s2">it together again and say we never have</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.060" end="00:12:03.340" style="s2">the the the truth where is the truth the</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.530" end="00:12:05.500" style="s2">truth is always changing we we are in a</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.340" end="00:12:08.380" style="s2">stream of evolution we never arrive at</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.500" end="00:12:10.540" style="s2">that place but we need to keep</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.380" end="00:12:13.360" style="s2">questioning and we need to put together</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.540" end="00:12:16.150" style="s2">those pieces that makes that create</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.360" end="00:12:22.810" style="s2">solid ground for us that creates these</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.150" end="00:12:26.320" style="s2">these maps that we so that we know where</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.810" end="00:12:28.330" style="s2">to go so we have role models we have we</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.320" end="00:12:31.330" style="s2">have people we have values that we</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.330" end="00:12:34.000" style="s2">resonate with so so we&#39;re not just lost</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.330" end="00:12:36.100" style="s2">and we see that even I&#39;m from</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.000" end="00:12:37.540" style="s2">Scandinavia and Scandinavia is one of</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.100" end="00:12:40.390" style="s2">the places in the world that has the</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.540" end="00:12:43.270" style="s2">highest amount of gender equality but</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.390" end="00:12:47.500" style="s2">what also happens is that we see as</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.270" end="00:12:51.580" style="s2">somehow gender neutral space where men</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.500" end="00:12:54.630" style="s2">and women are the same and it has it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.580" end="00:12:57.580" style="s2">so important to move through that but</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.630" end="00:12:58.870" style="s2">especially many friends about sex yes</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.580" end="00:13:02.170" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.870" end="00:13:04.390" style="s2">men are completely losing their identity</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.170" end="00:13:06.370" style="s2">and losing their power they are losing</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.390" end="00:13:09.730" style="s2">they&#39;re losing the essence of</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.370" end="00:13:11.470" style="s2">masculinity and women are somehow taking</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.730" end="00:13:14.500" style="s2">that over and getting bitter and</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.470" end="00:13:17.320" style="s2">resentful about it so at the surface it</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.500" end="00:13:18.730" style="s2">looks like a really equal society but in</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.320" end="00:13:21.010" style="s2">terms of relationship</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.730" end="00:13:23.279" style="s2">in terms of polarity it&#39;s not working</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.010" end="00:13:23.279" style="s2">very well</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.130" end="00:13:30.540" style="s2">you watch the Jordan Peterson Kathy</p>

<p begin="00:13:30.540" end="00:13:37.230" style="s2">think oh I</p>

<p begin="00:13:42.630" end="00:13:53.460" style="s2">and I could see how the shadow part of</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.280" end="00:13:57.510" style="s2">womanhood was acting out I could see how</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.460" end="00:14:01.380" style="s2">the collective rage was acting through</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.510" end="00:14:04.680" style="s2">Kathy Newman and this is what happens is</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.380" end="00:14:08.910" style="s2">that when that&#39;s unknown its projected</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.680" end="00:14:11.250" style="s2">blindly on to whatever stick wherever it</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.910" end="00:14:13.230" style="s2">sticks and it was very clear that she</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.250" end="00:14:15.180" style="s2">already had an agenda and she already</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.230" end="00:14:18.120" style="s2">had a projection that she was just</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.180" end="00:14:21.090" style="s2">looking to state she was she was just</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.120" end="00:14:23.130" style="s2">looking to have that confirmed and she</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.090" end="00:14:28.590" style="s2">was trying so hard and I felt this was</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.130" end="00:14:31.370" style="s2">just a classical example of feminine</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.590" end="00:14:37.470" style="s2">manipulation of the deep shadow</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.370" end="00:14:39.930" style="s2">manipulation control abuse so I felt on</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.470" end="00:14:42.810" style="s2">behalf of women I felt sad and</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.930" end="00:14:47.430" style="s2">disappointed because we need to have</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.810" end="00:14:49.710" style="s2">intelligent conversations that that that</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.430" end="00:14:53.220" style="s2">is aligned with the evolutionary stream</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.710" end="00:14:56.910" style="s2">that is aligned with creating a future</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.220" end="00:15:00.150" style="s2">not destroying but finding those values</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.910" end="00:15:02.480" style="s2">have an intelligent conversation and in</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.150" end="00:15:06.060" style="s2">that sense I would have loved to see</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.480" end="00:15:08.430" style="s2">Jordan Peterson become present with that</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.060" end="00:15:10.680" style="s2">in that moment and say okay I want to</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.430" end="00:15:13.020" style="s2">timeout from the debate that we are</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.680" end="00:15:14.430" style="s2">having and I want to explore what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.020" end="00:15:16.200" style="s2">actually going on right here</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.430" end="00:15:19.020" style="s2">because I can feel you&#39;re coming with a</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.200" end="00:15:21.600" style="s2">lot of anger and I think it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.020" end="00:15:23.790" style="s2">that that anger gets acknowledged but</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.600" end="00:15:26.280" style="s2">that we become real with what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.790" end="00:15:26.970" style="s2">and say it&#39;s a projection I understand</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.280" end="00:15:29.910" style="s2">why it&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.970" end="00:15:32.460" style="s2">but I would like us to find a way to</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.910" end="00:15:34.770" style="s2">move through it this is what we need as</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.460" end="00:15:38.460" style="s2">men and women instead of blindly</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.770" end="00:15:39.630" style="s2">projecting our rage on to whoever man</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.460" end="00:15:42.660" style="s2">shows up for it</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.630" end="00:15:44.819" style="s2">and you said before something about that</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.660" end="00:15:48.180" style="s2">she came in as a victim but but under</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.819" end="00:15:50.880" style="s2">the surface was abuse it was about it I</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.180" end="00:15:53.490" style="s2">felt it was absolutely abusive that she</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.880" end="00:15:56.579" style="s2">was manipulating everything that he was</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.490" end="00:15:58.980" style="s2">saying she was manipulating it into into</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.579" end="00:16:01.019" style="s2">the image she had in her head and she</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.980" end="00:16:03.509" style="s2">would just twist what he was saying and</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.019" end="00:16:06.209" style="s2">she would not listen so it was not a</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.509" end="00:16:10.730" style="s2">conversation it was it was a power game</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.209" end="00:16:13.709" style="s2">and she was the abuser and I I felt</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.730" end="00:16:15.839" style="s2">cringy on behalf of women that this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.709" end="00:16:17.310" style="s2">not an empowered woman this is not the</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.839" end="00:16:20.009" style="s2">empowered feminine this is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.310" end="00:16:22.709" style="s2">underbelly of feminism this is when</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.009" end="00:16:25.230" style="s2">feminism goes wrong this is not the</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.709" end="00:16:28.680" style="s2">future it&#39;s not the future to blame and</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.230" end="00:16:30.089" style="s2">to project and to persecute can you</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.680" end="00:16:33.209" style="s2">explain what you mean a bit more about</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.089" end="00:16:36.720" style="s2">when feminism goes wrong when feminism</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.209" end="00:16:44.279" style="s2">goes wrong we allow the collective rage</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.720" end="00:16:46.769" style="s2">to act out through us so we see every</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.279" end="00:16:50.370" style="s2">situation we see every man we&#39;d see</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.769" end="00:16:53.430" style="s2">every encounter with the lens of of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.370" end="00:16:55.889" style="s2">victim and we&#39;re so angry about it and</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.430" end="00:16:57.540" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s boiling in every woman it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.889" end="00:17:00.509" style="s2">right under the surface so she will</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.540" end="00:17:02.880" style="s2">quickly snap if if this if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.509" end="00:17:04.620" style="s2">reason or if there&#39;s an apparent reason</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.880" end="00:17:06.839" style="s2">because it&#39;s so strong it hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.620" end="00:17:09.150" style="s2">discharged it&#39;s in the collective and</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.839" end="00:17:11.449" style="s2">that rage needs to discharge but it</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.150" end="00:17:14.730" style="s2">needs to discharge in an intelligent way</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.449" end="00:17:17.010" style="s2">not in an unconscious way and you said</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.730" end="00:17:20.400" style="s2">before that that rage is often directed</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.010" end="00:17:23.309" style="s2">at men not showing up I&#39;d say it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.400" end="00:17:25.620" style="s2">two-way because yes it&#39;s it&#39;s targeted</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.309" end="00:17:29.669" style="s2">at men not showing up or they are</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.620" end="00:17:31.559" style="s2">causing it but it&#39;s very often projected</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.669" end="00:17:34.500" style="s2">out to men that are actually trying to</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.559" end="00:17:37.200" style="s2">show up that is actually engaging and we</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.500" end="00:17:40.409" style="s2">will engaging with women and actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.200" end="00:17:42.750" style="s2">talking about these things so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.409" end="00:17:45.539" style="s2">that&#39;s because then we we bring up this</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.750" end="00:17:48.150" style="s2">topic and then it&#39;s so easy for women to</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.539" end="00:17:51.059" style="s2">tap into that collective pool of rage</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.150" end="00:17:53.320" style="s2">and it it just comes out and it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.059" end="00:17:57.130" style="s2">very difficult as well because one</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.320" end="00:17:58.750" style="s2">imagines that that combative attitude is</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.130" end="00:18:00.639" style="s2">something that has served her well in</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.750" end="00:18:02.590" style="s2">the past and it&#39;s something that she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.639" end="00:18:03.759" style="s2">maybe felt forced into because of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.590" end="00:18:05.500" style="s2">nature of the society that she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.759" end="00:18:08.080" style="s2">operating in so it&#39;s a kind of catch-22</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.500" end="00:18:10.120" style="s2">situation for the many successful women</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.080" end="00:18:12.789" style="s2">because they feel that they&#39;re pushed to</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.120" end="00:18:15.340" style="s2">be more masculine and then when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.789" end="00:18:19.360" style="s2">more masculine they get judged for being</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.340" end="00:18:21.549" style="s2">more masculine it&#39;s it&#39;s very sad and</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.360" end="00:18:24.220" style="s2">and and I can see that dynamics being</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.549" end="00:18:26.080" style="s2">played out absolutely but I think the</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.220" end="00:18:28.720" style="s2">only thing we can do is to take</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.080" end="00:18:31.360" style="s2">responsibility and say okay I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.720" end="00:18:33.850" style="s2">that do I really want to compromise my</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.360" end="00:18:35.110" style="s2">femininity do I want to compromise my</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.850" end="00:18:37.779" style="s2">integrity</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.110" end="00:18:40.389" style="s2">do I want to compromise my gender and</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.779" end="00:18:42.639" style="s2">play that or is there another way that I</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.389" end="00:18:45.759" style="s2">can be powerful without being aggressive</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.639" end="00:18:48.279" style="s2">without playing a power game but resting</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.759" end="00:18:51.039" style="s2">in my natural power resting in my</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.279" end="00:18:53.440" style="s2">natural dignity resting in that deep</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.039" end="00:18:56.799" style="s2">rootedness that we both have in our</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.440" end="00:18:59.639" style="s2">genders that when we are peace with it</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.799" end="00:19:02.409" style="s2">and when we acknowledge it in ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.639" end="00:19:03.759" style="s2">it&#39;s there as a natural thing and this</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.409" end="00:19:05.860" style="s2">is the thing I don&#39;t want to make this</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.759" end="00:19:08.169" style="s2">personal about Kathy Newman because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.860" end="00:19:10.870" style="s2">it&#39;s in that potential is in every woman</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.169" end="00:19:13.299" style="s2">but it&#39;s because we are persecuting our</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.870" end="00:19:14.919" style="s2">own femininity what&#39;s being played out</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.299" end="00:19:16.960" style="s2">that we&#39;re doing it to ourselves because</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.919" end="00:19:18.820" style="s2">we don&#39;t trust that it&#39;s good enough to</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.960" end="00:19:21.220" style="s2">be a woman we don&#39;t trust that we can</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.820" end="00:19:23.679" style="s2">have conversations that come from a felt</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.220" end="00:19:26.529" style="s2">embodied perspective we don&#39;t trust that</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.679" end="00:19:30.429" style="s2">we&#39;re connected to truth because these</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.529" end="00:19:32.440" style="s2">these masculine ways have been have been</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.429" end="00:19:35.080" style="s2">very strong and women have been denying</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.440" end="00:19:37.389" style="s2">their own power and I also want to say</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.080" end="00:19:39.070" style="s2">that this isn&#39;t even though the the</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.389" end="00:19:41.169" style="s2">specific example is the Kathy Newman</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.070" end="00:19:43.929" style="s2">Jordan Peters an interview it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.169" end="00:19:46.480" style="s2">specific to to Kathy Newman I think the</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.929" end="00:19:47.740" style="s2">fact that that interview has resonated</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.480" end="00:19:50.279" style="s2">with so many people that it&#39;s been so</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.740" end="00:19:53.500" style="s2">popular shows that actually something</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.279" end="00:19:57.399" style="s2">archetypal was going on in that in that</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.500" end="00:20:00.129" style="s2">interaction and I think as well why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.399" end="00:20:02.590" style="s2">gone viral is a lot of people watching</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.129" end="00:20:04.000" style="s2">it recognize those dynamics they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.590" end="00:20:06.460" style="s2">I&#39;ve been in conversations like that</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.000" end="00:20:07.070" style="s2">I&#39;ve been in this conversation where</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.460" end="00:20:10.429" style="s2">nothing</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.070" end="00:20:11.630" style="s2">but nothing I say gets through so</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.429" end="00:20:13.639" style="s2">there&#39;s something sort of fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.630" end="00:20:15.529" style="s2">about about the masculine feminine</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.639" end="00:20:16.909" style="s2">dynamic that&#39;s going on in there what do</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.529" end="00:20:17.690" style="s2">you think that is I think Jordan</p>

<p begin="00:20:23.929" end="00:20:27.950" style="s2">I know it in myself and women that say</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.539" end="00:20:31.519" style="s2">they don&#39;t they&#39;re just denying it</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.950" end="00:20:33.409" style="s2">because it is in the collective so in</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.519" end="00:20:35.750" style="s2">that sense it just highlighted what</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.409" end="00:20:40.210" style="s2">what&#39;s there it&#39;s wonderful because here</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.750" end="00:20:43.490" style="s2">we really get to look at why is this so</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.210" end="00:20:46.789" style="s2">important why is it so important to</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.490" end="00:20:49.070" style="s2">listen to to a thinker like Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.789" end="00:20:51.980" style="s2">Peterson and take it seriously and say</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.070" end="00:20:55.460" style="s2">what can we do with it it&#39;s just so</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.980" end="00:20:57.620" style="s2">obvious that it&#39;s needed because if this</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.460" end="00:20:59.840" style="s2">is where we are if this is where society</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.620" end="00:21:01.960" style="s2">and cultures is if this is the ability</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.840" end="00:21:04.220" style="s2">to have an intelligent conversations</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.960" end="00:21:05.419" style="s2">conversation then we are in trouble in</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.220" end="00:21:07.730" style="s2">the interview that I did with Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.419" end="00:21:09.500" style="s2">Peterson he said that the Animus</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.730" end="00:21:11.149" style="s2">possessed woman which is the woman who</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.500" end="00:21:13.190" style="s2">sort of inner masculine side is a kind</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.149" end="00:21:16.129" style="s2">of defense for the feminine side sees</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.190" end="00:21:18.679" style="s2">every man or project onto every man the</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.129" end="00:21:20.240" style="s2">patriarchy the tyrannical King and the</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.679" end="00:21:22.580" style="s2">way out of that to see it from a Jungian</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.240" end="00:21:25.220" style="s2">perspective that the masculine archetype</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.580" end="00:21:28.549" style="s2">has both sides the masculine archetype</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.220" end="00:21:31.850" style="s2">is both the tyrannical senile king and</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.549" end="00:21:34.700" style="s2">the benevolent father at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.850" end="00:21:37.309" style="s2">and so that they&#39;re multi-layered and</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.700" end="00:21:39.799" style="s2">you can see either side and in in any</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.309" end="00:21:42.230" style="s2">man but the animus possessed woman only</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.799" end="00:21:44.000" style="s2">sees one side and that is the patriarchy</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.230" end="00:21:45.049" style="s2">that is a tyrannical system that is</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.000" end="00:21:48.379" style="s2">something that just needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.049" end="00:21:50.570" style="s2">destroyed does that make a lot of sense</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.379" end="00:21:52.279" style="s2">to you I feel that&#39;s that&#39;s precisely</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.570" end="00:21:55.820" style="s2">what&#39;s going on it&#39;s this blind</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.279" end="00:21:58.549" style="s2">projection that makes every man in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.820" end="00:22:01.669" style="s2">situation it it create it makes it into</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.549" end="00:22:04.429" style="s2">an image so and and and that that image</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.669" end="00:22:06.379" style="s2">is where all the rage can go so I I</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.429" end="00:22:09.129" style="s2">would absolutely agree with that but</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.379" end="00:22:12.200" style="s2">another thing I want to say is that that</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.129" end="00:22:16.549" style="s2">rage that is just waiting for an outlet</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.200" end="00:22:19.129" style="s2">also has also is important information</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.549" end="00:22:19.779" style="s2">in in the sense that it needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.129" end="00:22:23.019" style="s2">heard it</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.779" end="00:22:27.519" style="s2">needs to be acknowledged and it is also</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.019" end="00:22:31.119" style="s2">there because women haven&#39;t found a way</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.519" end="00:22:35.169" style="s2">to be in our power which is not</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.119" end="00:22:36.820" style="s2">necessarily the way of the mind and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.169" end="00:22:39.580" style="s2">way of having an intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.820" end="00:22:41.799" style="s2">conversation about something it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.580" end="00:22:44.379" style="s2">coming back to the body and it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.799" end="00:22:47.139" style="s2">coming back to feeling the energy of</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.379" end="00:22:51.429" style="s2">what&#39;s going on and really trusting that</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.139" end="00:22:54.309" style="s2">we know in our body a deep truth that</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.429" end="00:22:56.229" style="s2">cannot necessarily be met or</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.309" end="00:22:58.629" style="s2">acknowledged in an intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.229" end="00:23:01.089" style="s2">conversation and because women have not</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.629" end="00:23:05.499" style="s2">been able to articulate that deep truth</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.089" end="00:23:07.570" style="s2">that deep wisdom that deep power that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.499" end="00:23:10.089" style="s2">also where the rage comes because we</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.570" end="00:23:12.190" style="s2">know that deep down there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.089" end="00:23:14.440" style="s2">that hasn&#39;t been seen and acknowledged</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.190" end="00:23:16.539" style="s2">and by men and we&#39;re so angry about that</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.440" end="00:23:20.859" style="s2">but we just forget that we have to start</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.539" end="00:23:23.379" style="s2">with ourselves and to say okay I feel</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.859" end="00:23:25.179" style="s2">something is going on here how can we</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.379" end="00:23:27.429" style="s2">address this in an intelligent way that</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.179" end="00:23:29.349" style="s2">is not just pure philosophy and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.429" end="00:23:31.809" style="s2">just a pure intellectual conversation</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.349" end="00:23:35.009" style="s2">but it&#39;s in touch with what&#39;s real it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.809" end="00:23:37.719" style="s2">in touch with life it&#39;s in touch with</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.009" end="00:23:40.649" style="s2">co-creating evolution co-creating</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.719" end="00:23:43.139" style="s2">consciousness and we can&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.649" end="00:23:47.469" style="s2">only in an intellectual conversation</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.139" end="00:23:50.200" style="s2">where we just we just we&#39;re just arguing</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.469" end="00:23:51.460" style="s2">against each other shadows it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.200" end="00:23:53.589" style="s2">really symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.460" end="00:23:56.549" style="s2">completely yes an ideological conscious</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.589" end="00:23:59.589" style="s2">yeah that reminds me of something that</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.549" end="00:24:02.529" style="s2">I&#39;ve heard before that men test ideas</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.589" end="00:24:03.849" style="s2">and women test men and there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.529" end="00:24:07.149" style="s2">truth in that from what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.849" end="00:24:09.279" style="s2">it&#39;s like because women know on a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.149" end="00:24:10.839" style="s2">level than men and women know when men</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.279" end="00:24:14.789" style="s2">are out of alignment on a much more</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.839" end="00:24:17.139" style="s2">deeper level than men often do and so</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.789" end="00:24:20.529" style="s2">there is something about women&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.139" end="00:24:22.809" style="s2">embodied way of knowing and a genuine</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.529" end="00:24:24.729" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a very you it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.809" end="00:24:27.129" style="s2">essential for women to test men it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.729" end="00:24:28.869" style="s2">like so how aligned are you and that I</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.129" end="00:24:32.289" style="s2">think is what is playing out on the</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.869" end="00:24:33.159" style="s2">wider the wider culture this the</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.289" end="00:24:36.580" style="s2">excesses</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.159" end="00:24:40.029" style="s2">of feminism you could say our men being</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.580" end="00:24:43.629" style="s2">tested on an epic cultural level to show</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.029" end="00:24:46.779" style="s2">up to grow up to acknowledge our shadows</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.629" end="00:24:48.460" style="s2">and to be present and that is is maybe</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.779" end="00:24:50.169" style="s2">that&#39;s the evolutionary step that we</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.460" end="00:24:51.369" style="s2">need to see but then also like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.169" end="00:24:53.349" style="s2">saying women need to acknowledge their</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.369" end="00:24:55.299" style="s2">shadows as well yeah but I think that</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.349" end="00:24:58.629" style="s2">was playing up perfectly in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.299" end="00:25:01.659" style="s2">interview in in the sense that Kathy she</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.629" end="00:25:04.690" style="s2">just got more and more angry and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.659" end="00:25:07.210" style="s2">reason why what was missing out was a</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.690" end="00:25:10.179" style="s2">masculine being present with her and</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.210" end="00:25:12.099" style="s2">feeling her instead of just meeting her</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.179" end="00:25:14.830" style="s2">with the mind because that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.099" end="00:25:16.619" style="s2">feel overpowering if you feel if if</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.830" end="00:25:19.149" style="s2">you&#39;re in your emotions and in your body</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.619" end="00:25:24.669" style="s2">instead of being really present and say</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.149" end="00:25:26.859" style="s2">I feel your rage I understand it so</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.669" end="00:25:29.919" style="s2">that&#39;s where we can start moving on</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.859" end="00:25:32.559" style="s2">because the feminine will feel seen she</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.919" end="00:25:35.830" style="s2">will feel respected in that embodied</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.559" end="00:25:39.609" style="s2">truth because yes women have something</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.830" end="00:25:41.830" style="s2">to be enraged about for sure and we we</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.609" end="00:25:45.399" style="s2">need that to become real and not to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.830" end="00:25:48.369" style="s2">just become a power battle so yes women</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.399" end="00:25:51.309" style="s2">test men to call them into presence and</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.369" end="00:25:53.019" style="s2">embodiment and just an intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.309" end="00:25:56.200" style="s2">conversation is not enough it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.019" end="00:25:58.509" style="s2">gonna keep stirring up the rage so we</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.200" end="00:26:00.849" style="s2">need to find a way to have that</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.509" end="00:26:02.769" style="s2">conversation where both the body the</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.849" end="00:26:05.529" style="s2">deeper waste and the deeper intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.769" end="00:26:07.539" style="s2">and the mind is there present on both</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.529" end="00:26:09.399" style="s2">sides so that&#39;s what I mean about having</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.539" end="00:26:11.440" style="s2">an intelligent conversation it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.399" end="00:26:13.359" style="s2">just the conversation of the mind it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.440" end="00:26:16.149" style="s2">conversation about what&#39;s real what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.359" end="00:26:18.729" style="s2">aligned with life and that&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.149" end="00:26:21.309" style="s2">different conversation it&#39;s a different</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.729" end="00:26:22.450" style="s2">way of communicating so that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.309" end="00:26:25.440" style="s2">Jordan Peterson could have done better</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.450" end="00:26:27.849" style="s2">in that interview is just to have said I</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.440" end="00:26:29.710" style="s2">can feel where you&#39;re coming from I</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.849" end="00:26:32.259" style="s2">think that could have changed the whole</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.710" end="00:26:33.879" style="s2">energy the whole dynamic and it could</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.259" end="00:26:36.159" style="s2">have moved it forward but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.879" end="00:26:40.059" style="s2">impossible to move it forward when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.159" end="00:26:42.039" style="s2">both in battle mode so yes if you want a</p>
