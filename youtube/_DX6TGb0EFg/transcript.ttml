<p begin="00:01:48.540" end="00:01:53.100" style="s2">enthusiastic about Michael being here at</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.579" end="00:01:55.439" style="s2">the stoah and with all of us</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.100" end="00:01:57.600" style="s2">working on so many different projects</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.439" end="00:02:00.090" style="s2">and having different passions one of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.600" end="00:02:03.930" style="s2">golden threads that I see between us all</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.090" end="00:02:07.740" style="s2">is this return to community us a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.930" end="00:02:10.110" style="s2">sense of community and in one of</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.740" end="00:02:11.910" style="s2">Michael&#39;s recent podcasts he said we are</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.110" end="00:02:13.750" style="s2">being called to awaken the soul of</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.910" end="00:02:16.900" style="s2">humanity and reweave the</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.750" end="00:02:21.580" style="s2">bonds of communities and that really</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.900" end="00:02:23.440" style="s2">resonated with me and with what I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.580" end="00:02:25.180" style="s2">it is that I&#39;m doing here at the store</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.440" end="00:02:29.140" style="s2">some of you and in our individual</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.180" end="00:02:33.400" style="s2">projects as well and so my question what</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.140" end="00:02:37.150" style="s2">I&#39;m curious about Michael is how does</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.400" end="00:02:38.560" style="s2">communitas support and how can what to</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.150" end="00:02:41.380" style="s2">what extent is it necessary for the</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.560" end="00:02:44.170" style="s2">discovery of and the expression of</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.380" end="00:02:47.500" style="s2">personal genius or to what extent is</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.170" end="00:02:51.340" style="s2">that discovery like a lone wolf hero&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.500" end="00:02:53.590" style="s2">journey and and then also relating that</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.340" end="00:02:56.620" style="s2">to the idea that when enough of us</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.590" end="00:03:00.040" style="s2">awaken to this a genius how that</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.620" end="00:03:02.110" style="s2">supports the collective initiation so</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.040" end="00:03:04.150" style="s2">I&#39;m sort of wanting to tie these ideas</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.110" end="00:03:06.209" style="s2">of personal genius communitas and</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.150" end="00:03:09.010" style="s2">collective initiation together as</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.209" end="00:03:12.070" style="s2">somewhat of a compass for me in my</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.010" end="00:03:15.580" style="s2">pursuits of designing for communitas and</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.070" end="00:03:20.140" style="s2">how to to do that with wisdom and</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.580" end="00:03:23.170" style="s2">direction so that is um where my inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.140" end="00:03:24.760" style="s2">is aiming and if that makes sense to you</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.170" end="00:03:27.310" style="s2">I would love to hear you speak about</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.760" end="00:03:33.010" style="s2">that okay thank you</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.310" end="00:03:36.280" style="s2">so welcome everyone genius to me I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.010" end="00:03:41.260" style="s2">redefined genius the common sense of</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.280" end="00:03:45.070" style="s2">genius is high IQ or specific rare</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.260" end="00:03:47.709" style="s2">talent but the word genius from the</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.070" end="00:03:50.320" style="s2">Latin means the spirit that&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.709" end="00:03:53.769" style="s2">there so it&#39;s the spirit that&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.320" end="00:03:56.560" style="s2">inside each person born and the old idea</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.769" end="00:03:59.769" style="s2">would be that that spirit that seed of</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.560" end="00:04:02.829" style="s2">genius is in the soul so the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.769" end="00:04:05.970" style="s2">each person comes in each person like</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.829" end="00:04:09.250" style="s2">each tree in the forest is unique and</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.970" end="00:04:12.190" style="s2">inside the soul of that unique person is</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.250" end="00:04:18.239" style="s2">the spirit of genius trying waiting to</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.190" end="00:04:21.489" style="s2">awaken and so I distinguish genius from</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.239" end="00:04:24.580" style="s2">talent talent is a part of genius talent</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.489" end="00:04:27.250" style="s2">is a an old German word for the weight</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.580" end="00:04:30.190" style="s2">used to measure gold</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.250" end="00:04:34.420" style="s2">so that tells me that if the person</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.190" end="00:04:38.020" style="s2">doesn&#39;t express their talent it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.420" end="00:04:40.000" style="s2">a weight on their soul and so talent is</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.020" end="00:04:43.770" style="s2">part of it but not the whole of it</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.000" end="00:04:47.080" style="s2">other capacities are involved and also</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.770" end="00:04:49.600" style="s2">distinct ways of feeling erratically</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.080" end="00:04:53.740" style="s2">connected to the world are part of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.600" end="00:04:56.370" style="s2">genius kind of core but another thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.740" end="00:05:00.550" style="s2">that I think is really important is each</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.370" end="00:05:02.350" style="s2">genius has its own style so that if</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.550" end="00:05:05.860" style="s2">you&#39;re interested in a certain kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.350" end="00:05:08.320" style="s2">music you&#39;ll soon start to select out oh</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.860" end="00:05:10.360" style="s2">that&#39;s how so-and-so please that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.320" end="00:05:11.770" style="s2">so-and-so plays they can play the same</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.360" end="00:05:15.520" style="s2">instrument but they play with their</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.770" end="00:05:18.220" style="s2">style so style is not a fashion word</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.520" end="00:05:21.419" style="s2">style goes back to the Latin word</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.220" end="00:05:24.880" style="s2">stylist something that is engraved and</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.419" end="00:05:26.620" style="s2">so a person&#39;s style is really something</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.880" end="00:05:30.000" style="s2">engraved or you could say written on</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.620" end="00:05:34.150" style="s2">their soul and awakening to that style</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.000" end="00:05:39.010" style="s2">gives a person their entry points into</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.150" end="00:05:42.280" style="s2">life so to me genius is presents and</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.010" end="00:05:46.240" style="s2">everyone born and and as a result it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.280" end="00:05:50.169" style="s2">more pertinent to me than heroics</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.240" end="00:05:53.410" style="s2">so the hero&#39;s journey comes from the</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.169" end="00:05:56.800" style="s2">early book by Joseph Campbell hero with</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.410" end="00:06:00.520" style="s2">a thousand faces and in the book he</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.800" end="00:06:02.919" style="s2">calls the hero&#39;s myth the monomyth the</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.520" end="00:06:05.080" style="s2">only story and I really disagree I wrote</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.919" end="00:06:08.820" style="s2">a book called the genius myths saying</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.080" end="00:06:12.550" style="s2">that whereas the hero is tends to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.820" end="00:06:14.220" style="s2">aggressive masculine muscular and aimed</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.550" end="00:06:16.750" style="s2">at an out of thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.220" end="00:06:20.740" style="s2">the genius is something already in</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.750" end="00:06:23.140" style="s2">everybody regardless of its male or</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.740" end="00:06:25.479" style="s2">female or any kind of gender orientation</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.140" end="00:06:28.060" style="s2">any kind of ethnic background everyone</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.479" end="00:06:32.550" style="s2">has it so that to me seems more</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.060" end="00:06:35.950" style="s2">important and where it relates to the</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.550" end="00:06:38.440" style="s2">meta crises as you called it</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.950" end="00:06:40.740" style="s2">is so the way I look at that is the</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.440" end="00:06:43.210" style="s2">biggest crisis in the world right now is</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.740" end="00:06:45.810" style="s2">global climate change because it affects</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.210" end="00:06:49.390" style="s2">all the ecosystems all the living beings</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.810" end="00:06:51.850" style="s2">the waters and the entire earth and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.390" end="00:06:55.450" style="s2">right below that now we have the corona</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.850" end="00:06:57.670" style="s2">virus pandemic which so you have a an</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.450" end="00:07:00.090" style="s2">ecological crisis and then below it we</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.670" end="00:07:03.100" style="s2">have the pandemic which is like really a</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.090" end="00:07:05.140" style="s2">humanitarian crisis that has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.100" end="00:07:08.440" style="s2">health and now it has its own economic</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.140" end="00:07:11.440" style="s2">crisis and but it&#39;s really at the</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.440" end="00:07:15.220" style="s2">humanitarian level and then the third</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.440" end="00:07:20.170" style="s2">major crisis right now I think was the</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.220" end="00:07:22.720" style="s2">death of George Floyd being deprived of</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.170" end="00:07:26.380" style="s2">the life life breath right in front of</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.720" end="00:07:30.340" style="s2">everybody as a actual thing and as a</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.380" end="00:07:33.400" style="s2">symbol of racial injustice but all kinds</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.340" end="00:07:35.380" style="s2">of other oppressions in the world so</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.400" end="00:07:36.730" style="s2">that the death of that one person spread</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.380" end="00:07:40.420" style="s2">throughout the world and it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.730" end="00:07:44.080" style="s2">affecting people&#39;s passions and ideas</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.420" end="00:07:48.490" style="s2">about injustice and so it&#39;s as if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.080" end="00:07:50.230" style="s2">in this cascade of crises and each one</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.490" end="00:07:53.800" style="s2">of them is complex each has its own</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.230" end="00:07:58.770" style="s2">history and each has a mystery in it in</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.800" end="00:08:01.180" style="s2">a sense as well so my sense is heroic</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.770" end="00:08:03.730" style="s2">activities have kind of gotten us in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.180" end="00:08:06.000" style="s2">trouble we&#39;re in and the only way I see</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.730" end="00:08:08.860" style="s2">getting out is that there&#39;s a greater</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.000" end="00:08:11.590" style="s2">awakening of all the diverse unique</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.860" end="00:08:14.350" style="s2">geniuses inside as many people as</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.590" end="00:08:17.950" style="s2">possible because when a person awakens</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.350" end="00:08:22.120" style="s2">to the Jew their genius they also get an</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.950" end="00:08:24.880" style="s2">orientation into life in other words</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.120" end="00:08:29.290" style="s2">some people are already carrying inside</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.880" end="00:08:31.930" style="s2">you could say before birth some capacity</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.290" end="00:08:33.940" style="s2">to work in nature to work with forests</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.930" end="00:08:36.400" style="s2">the real rebuilding of forests while</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.940" end="00:08:39.190" style="s2">someone else has more of a natural</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.400" end="00:08:41.740" style="s2">capacity for hospice work and someone</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.190" end="00:08:44.140" style="s2">else has a capacity to work on vaccines</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.740" end="00:08:46.510" style="s2">and someone else has a capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.140" end="00:08:48.580" style="s2">pediatrics and helping children and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.510" end="00:08:51.279" style="s2">it&#39;s all of those things</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.580" end="00:08:53.320" style="s2">operating at the same time at a more</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.279" end="00:08:55.570" style="s2">awakened level that would give us the</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.320" end="00:08:58.720" style="s2">capacity to take on all the complexities</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.570" end="00:09:00.550" style="s2">of all the levels of crisis so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.720" end="00:09:05.760" style="s2">that&#39;s how I see that going together</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.550" end="00:09:10.149" style="s2">um and then for me this idea of genius</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.760" end="00:09:13.839" style="s2">latent genius is connected to the notion</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.149" end="00:09:16.810" style="s2">of calling and so you know that the two</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.839" end="00:09:20.410" style="s2">different roads you could say into the</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.810" end="00:09:23.020" style="s2">world are career which is usually either</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.410" end="00:09:26.589" style="s2">chosen by someone else or chosen unto</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.020" end="00:09:30.430" style="s2">some more superficial level of decision</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.589" end="00:09:33.399" style="s2">and then calling a vocation where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.430" end="00:09:34.990" style="s2">not us choosing we are chosen and to me</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.399" end="00:09:36.910" style="s2">that&#39;s the deeper richer thing it used</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.990" end="00:09:39.370" style="s2">to be called the second adventure of</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.910" end="00:09:41.230" style="s2">life the first adventure as we say in</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.370" end="00:09:43.750" style="s2">the modern world is get a life the</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.230" end="00:09:47.170" style="s2">second adventure is respond to the call</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.750" end="00:09:49.120" style="s2">and the call is calling to the genius</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.170" end="00:09:51.640" style="s2">that&#39;s already there the call isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.120" end="00:09:53.709" style="s2">simply going out and finding the</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.640" end="00:09:55.329" style="s2">treasure or the you know whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.709" end="00:09:58.029" style="s2">might be that person is looking for the</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.329" end="00:10:00.430" style="s2">knowledge the call is calling to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.029" end="00:10:03.339" style="s2">genius that&#39;s already inside and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.430" end="00:10:06.100" style="s2">genius already knows the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.339" end="00:10:08.709" style="s2">itself and the nature of its work so</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.100" end="00:10:12.310" style="s2">that there&#39;s the old idea with everybody</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.709" end="00:10:14.010" style="s2">also has a library inside them with all</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.310" end="00:10:16.390" style="s2">the knowledge that they&#39;re looking for</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.010" end="00:10:18.520" style="s2">not that we don&#39;t have to go out into</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.390" end="00:10:21.000" style="s2">the world because we have to be a person</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.520" end="00:10:23.430" style="s2">of our times and we have to feel the</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.000" end="00:10:27.310" style="s2">marketplace and the struggles of life</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.430" end="00:10:30.579" style="s2">but at the same time there&#39;s knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.310" end="00:10:35.560" style="s2">inside trying to awaken and so the old</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.579" end="00:10:38.110" style="s2">way of helping young people into this</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.560" end="00:10:42.089" style="s2">state of awakening which would be self</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.110" end="00:10:45.279" style="s2">revelation on one hand and then also</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.089" end="00:10:46.750" style="s2">some healing on the other hand and that</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.279" end="00:10:50.320" style="s2">would be done through the process of</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.750" end="00:10:52.180" style="s2">initiation or rites of passage which at</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.320" end="00:10:54.730" style="s2">one time would have existed all around</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.180" end="00:10:58.089" style="s2">the world and then I call that an</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.730" end="00:11:02.030" style="s2">archetypal arrangement I also think that</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.089" end="00:11:04.190" style="s2">the dynamic underneath transformation is</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.030" end="00:11:07.160" style="s2">passage and I&#39;ll say something about</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.190" end="00:11:10.160" style="s2">that shape in a minute but so what would</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.160" end="00:11:13.580" style="s2">happen in theory is a young person girl</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.160" end="00:11:17.870" style="s2">boy whomever it is would at a certain</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.580" end="00:11:20.810" style="s2">age go into an artful ritual process</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.870" end="00:11:24.380" style="s2">which would be aimed at several things</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.810" end="00:11:25.930" style="s2">one awakening the soul with its genius</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.380" end="00:11:29.570" style="s2">with its kind of natural inclinations</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.930" end="00:11:34.660" style="s2">with its colleague and then on the other</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.570" end="00:11:37.820" style="s2">hand repeating everyone gets wounded</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.660" end="00:11:39.230" style="s2">some people deny it but most people are</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.820" end="00:11:41.630" style="s2">wounded in childhood everybody</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.230" end="00:11:44.720" style="s2">experiences abandonment and everybody</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.630" end="00:11:47.090" style="s2">experiences some sense of wound and part</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.720" end="00:11:49.130" style="s2">of the idea is if we got everything we</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.090" end="00:11:50.510" style="s2">wanted through the family at home we</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.130" end="00:11:52.760" style="s2">would never leave we&#39;d all remain</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.510" end="00:11:55.010" style="s2">children something is missing and</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.760" end="00:11:56.990" style="s2">usually some wound has been given and</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.010" end="00:12:00.350" style="s2">that drives people out into the world</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.990" end="00:12:05.930" style="s2">but the the rite of passage would be the</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.350" end="00:12:08.330" style="s2">kind of elaborate artful deep awakening</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.930" end="00:12:10.280" style="s2">process between leaving childhood and</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.330" end="00:12:12.650" style="s2">entering the world so that when a person</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.280" end="00:12:14.570" style="s2">enter the world that no longer a child</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.650" end="00:12:17.270" style="s2">there are more awakened version of</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.570" end="00:12:21.740" style="s2">themselves and part of that would be</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.270" end="00:12:23.300" style="s2">some healing of early life wounds so</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.740" end="00:12:25.160" style="s2">that a person would learn about their</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.300" end="00:12:27.260" style="s2">own wounds they would learn about the</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.160" end="00:12:29.480" style="s2">process of healing and if they wound up</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.260" end="00:12:31.340" style="s2">in a position of power they would have</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.480" end="00:12:33.320" style="s2">compassion for others because they would</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.340" end="00:12:34.670" style="s2">understand woundedness and they would</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.320" end="00:12:38.060" style="s2">understand the need for healing</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.670" end="00:12:39.700" style="s2">especially in times like this so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.060" end="00:12:42.710" style="s2">calling the rites of passage the</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.700" end="00:12:45.620" style="s2">underlying dynamic of transformation and</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.710" end="00:12:48.290" style="s2">in classically there&#39;s three steps the</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.620" end="00:12:50.780" style="s2">first step is separation the second one</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.290" end="00:12:54.680" style="s2">is transition also called the liminal</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.780" end="00:12:57.770" style="s2">period and the third one is a return to</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.680" end="00:13:01.280" style="s2">community but at a new level of</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.770" end="00:13:02.900" style="s2">understanding and acceptance by a</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.280" end="00:13:05.690" style="s2">conscious community that would be a</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.900" end="00:13:09.260" style="s2">successful rite of passage so what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.690" end="00:13:11.990" style="s2">saying is literally we are now all</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.260" end="00:13:14.870" style="s2">separated many people are in quarantine</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.990" end="00:13:15.440" style="s2">or partial quarantine we are socially</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.870" end="00:13:19.280" style="s2">distant</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.440" end="00:13:21.020" style="s2">separated we&#39;re not able to have social</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.280" end="00:13:23.390" style="s2">gatherings a lot of people have lost</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.020" end="00:13:25.940" style="s2">their jobs there&#39;s been a breakdown of</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.390" end="00:13:28.610" style="s2">all the institutional functional ways</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.940" end="00:13:31.280" style="s2">that people socialize and and we&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.610" end="00:13:33.260" style="s2">separate as a result yes we&#39;re on zoom&#39;</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.280" end="00:13:36.170" style="s2">all the time but that&#39;s only a partial</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.260" end="00:13:39.860" style="s2">thing so we&#39;re literally in separation</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.170" end="00:13:43.070" style="s2">and so my sense of things kind of mythic</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.860" end="00:13:44.930" style="s2">story view is once something happens</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.070" end="00:13:47.620" style="s2">like that the soul thinks we&#39;re in an</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.930" end="00:13:51.080" style="s2">initiation the soul is this ancient and</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.620" end="00:13:53.870" style="s2">immediate thing that has this these old</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.080" end="00:13:56.150" style="s2">memories of human imagination and so I</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.870" end="00:13:58.040" style="s2">think the soul thinks oh they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.150" end="00:14:02.800" style="s2">an initiation again because they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.040" end="00:14:05.360" style="s2">separate then the second stage is called</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.800" end="00:14:07.190" style="s2">transition so you&#39;re moving from one</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.360" end="00:14:09.410" style="s2">form through a transition to another</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.190" end="00:14:12.920" style="s2">form whether it&#39;s the individual all the</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.410" end="00:14:16.070" style="s2">collective but I like the idea that that</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.920" end="00:14:19.190" style="s2">in-between stage the betwixt them</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.070" end="00:14:21.590" style="s2">between is liminal liminal comes from</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.190" end="00:14:24.620" style="s2">the old Latin word lemon which is the</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.590" end="00:14:27.860" style="s2">base of a doorway the threshold and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.620" end="00:14:29.540" style="s2">that it means you go from one space onto</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.860" end="00:14:32.120" style="s2">the threshold then into the next space</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.540" end="00:14:35.350" style="s2">so we&#39;re in a threshold condition or a</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.120" end="00:14:38.690" style="s2">liminal condition and and liminality</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.350" end="00:14:42.710" style="s2">includes the breakdown of structures the</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.690" end="00:14:45.710" style="s2">loss of patterns and and the opening up</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.710" end="00:14:47.570" style="s2">at a very deep level level to unusual</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.710" end="00:14:50.870" style="s2">opportunities but more immediately</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.570" end="00:14:53.540" style="s2">opening up to uncertainty and the need</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.870" end="00:14:57.650" style="s2">to face the unknown and so that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.540" end="00:15:00.470" style="s2">called liminal then you could say if</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.650" end="00:15:03.650" style="s2">you&#39;re on the threshold or the lemon the</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.470" end="00:15:05.630" style="s2">nearby word is subliminal which means</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.650" end="00:15:08.240" style="s2">below the threshold someone something&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.630" end="00:15:09.589" style="s2">trying to come up so if you accept the</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.240" end="00:15:12.740" style="s2">idea that we&#39;re in this uncertain</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.589" end="00:15:14.990" style="s2">liminal betwixt them between condition</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.740" end="00:15:17.690" style="s2">there&#39;s a suggestion that what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.990" end="00:15:20.570" style="s2">looking for is not the next strategic</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.690" end="00:15:23.030" style="s2">plan to get us back into the world as it</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.570" end="00:15:26.300" style="s2">was but actually something from the</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.030" end="00:15:29.059" style="s2">unconscious or the unseen that&#39;s trying</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.300" end="00:15:30.859" style="s2">to enter us and can only do so</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.059" end="00:15:33.529" style="s2">when the institution&#39;s rattle and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.859" end="00:15:36.439" style="s2">structures are loosened so on one hand</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.529" end="00:15:39.289" style="s2">we&#39;re in terrible crises that have to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.439" end="00:15:42.139" style="s2">faced on the other hand we&#39;re on the</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.289" end="00:15:45.829" style="s2">threshold or the verge of finding the</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.139" end="00:15:49.039" style="s2">next view of the world so in the middle</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.829" end="00:15:51.049" style="s2">ground the way I imagined it on one hand</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.039" end="00:15:54.079" style="s2">you have this liminality and uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.049" end="00:15:56.899" style="s2">and right next to it you have a greater</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.079" end="00:15:59.479" style="s2">opportunity for community toss committee</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.899" end="00:16:02.149" style="s2">toss being deep community something</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.479" end="00:16:05.269" style="s2">happens that&#39;s so deep and so meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.149" end="00:16:07.249" style="s2">it pulls people together without even</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.269" end="00:16:09.529" style="s2">the opportunity to figure out what their</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.249" end="00:16:12.109" style="s2">differences are the differences kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.529" end="00:16:14.419" style="s2">melt away because the deep soul becomes</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.109" end="00:16:17.869" style="s2">so activated and there&#39;s lots of ways to</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.419" end="00:16:21.889" style="s2">imagine that one way I saw it recently</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.869" end="00:16:25.429" style="s2">is in watching the protests of black</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.889" end="00:16:27.739" style="s2">lives matter and those few moments where</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.429" end="00:16:30.049" style="s2">there&#39;s a conversation between the</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.739" end="00:16:32.269" style="s2">police and the protesters and something</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.049" end="00:16:34.849" style="s2">happens and they all kneel down and</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.269" end="00:16:37.009" style="s2">that&#39;s communitas in the middle of all</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.849" end="00:16:38.599" style="s2">the commotion with smoke burning in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.009" end="00:16:40.909" style="s2">building behind them with everything</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.599" end="00:16:43.669" style="s2">undecided and no one knows what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.909" end="00:16:45.679" style="s2">on they find a moment to kneel and come</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.669" end="00:16:47.629" style="s2">to the ground together that&#39;s the deep</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.679" end="00:16:49.669" style="s2">ground of community tasks so it can</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.629" end="00:16:54.109" style="s2">happen in a moment and it happens in</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.669" end="00:16:55.959" style="s2">unexpected and surprising ways and so my</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.109" end="00:16:58.909" style="s2">understanding is from those two things</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.959" end="00:17:01.669" style="s2">suffering through the liminality the</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.909" end="00:17:04.639" style="s2">betwixt in between the uncertainty the</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.669" end="00:17:08.299" style="s2">radical changes and finding moments of</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.639" end="00:17:09.889" style="s2">deep humanity deep community tasks for</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.299" end="00:17:12.169" style="s2">the individual but possibly for the</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.889" end="00:17:15.139" style="s2">group as well that creates the energy</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.169" end="00:17:17.990" style="s2">and opens the imagination to get the</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.139" end="00:17:21.049" style="s2">ideas and the images for the next world</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.990" end="00:17:23.209" style="s2">and so then you arrive at the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.049" end="00:17:25.999" style="s2">big transition and everything and</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.209" end="00:17:29.210" style="s2">everyone has changed and then you begin</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.999" end="00:17:32.779" style="s2">the process over again that&#39;s the frame</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.210" end="00:17:37.549" style="s2">I&#39;m using to understand what we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.779" end="00:17:41.029" style="s2">and one other thing I should add if when</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.549" end="00:17:42.980" style="s2">there&#39;s a rite of passage or you can</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.029" end="00:17:45.020" style="s2">also call it initiation</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.980" end="00:17:48.200" style="s2">which means initiate means to step in to</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.020" end="00:17:51.309" style="s2">begin to begin again and again really</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.200" end="00:17:54.049" style="s2">but there&#39;s always a brush with death</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.309" end="00:17:56.840" style="s2">there&#39;s something that feels like life</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.049" end="00:18:00.440" style="s2">and death and so that&#39;s because the</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.840" end="00:18:05.240" style="s2">background idea and you could say the</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.440" end="00:18:08.120" style="s2">mystery behind creation is life death</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.240" end="00:18:12.200" style="s2">renewal in terms of a personal</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.120" end="00:18:16.010" style="s2">initiation its birth death rebirth so</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.200" end="00:18:19.640" style="s2">I&#39;m using a very old idea that says this</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.010" end="00:18:23.410" style="s2">whole thing with all its crises nature</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.640" end="00:18:26.630" style="s2">the cosmos the individual psyche all</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.410" end="00:18:30.980" style="s2">participating in life death renewal and</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.630" end="00:18:34.090" style="s2">so part of the liminal space and the</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.980" end="00:18:37.520" style="s2">middle ground is the death of things</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.090" end="00:18:40.160" style="s2">like recently here in the United States</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.520" end="00:18:42.980" style="s2">people decided to try and go back some</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.160" end="00:18:46.220" style="s2">people to try and go back to normal as</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.980" end="00:18:48.020" style="s2">they call it and it just didn&#39;t work it</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.220" end="00:18:51.410" style="s2">created more abnormal</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.020" end="00:18:53.750" style="s2">so once the rite of passage is underway</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.410" end="00:18:56.179" style="s2">once the initiation is underway there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.750" end="00:18:58.700" style="s2">no going back and the only thing is to</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.179" end="00:19:02.230" style="s2">go forward and the other thing I would</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.700" end="00:19:06.320" style="s2">just say maybe to bring it to a close is</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.230" end="00:19:08.660" style="s2">initiation takes us further and deeper</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.320" end="00:19:11.570" style="s2">into something than we would choose to</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.660" end="00:19:13.490" style="s2">go on our own it has to have that</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.570" end="00:19:15.200" style="s2">feeling of letting go I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.490" end="00:19:17.870" style="s2">what&#39;s going on and a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.200" end="00:19:20.179" style="s2">submission to the adventure and so I</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.870" end="00:19:22.460" style="s2">think that has happened collectively to</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.179" end="00:19:25.010" style="s2">everyone now we&#39;re way further into</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.460" end="00:19:27.799" style="s2">things than we would have chosen to go</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.010" end="00:19:31.880" style="s2">people would regulate it more we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.799" end="00:19:34.970" style="s2">already in radical circumstances and so</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.880" end="00:19:38.840" style="s2">I&#39;m suggesting these old ideas are ways</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.970" end="00:19:42.910" style="s2">to shape or hold some shape while</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.840" end="00:19:42.910" style="s2">everything is trying to change</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.240" end="00:19:51.840" style="s2">thank you that was wonderful please guys</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.799" end="00:19:54.419" style="s2">drop your questions in the chat there</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.840" end="00:19:56.789" style="s2">and then I will call on you to unmute</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.419" end="00:20:00.720" style="s2">and ask your question I will ask one</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.789" end="00:20:02.510" style="s2">question and then go to that one thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.720" end="00:20:05.130" style="s2">we&#39;re doing here at the snow michael is</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.510" end="00:20:06.600" style="s2">developing an ecology of practices and</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.130" end="00:20:08.640" style="s2">experimenting with different life</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.600" end="00:20:11.520" style="s2">practices and psycho technologies we can</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.640" end="00:20:13.649" style="s2">engage in as a community to develop</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.520" end="00:20:18.830" style="s2">sovereignty and resilience and</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.649" end="00:20:24.240" style="s2">communitas and in this liminal space and</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.830" end="00:20:28.320" style="s2">so I&#39;m wondering of what comes up for</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.240" end="00:20:32.870" style="s2">you as like essential life practices for</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.320" end="00:20:32.870" style="s2">developing sovereignty and communitas</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.330" end="00:20:41.039" style="s2">yeah that we might get that we might</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.039" end="00:20:46.230" style="s2">experiment with or even repurpose for</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.039" end="00:20:49.409" style="s2">the current moment so in mythological</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.230" end="00:20:53.330" style="s2">terms there&#39;s two main roads of practice</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.409" end="00:20:57.240" style="s2">and one is the contemplative road</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.330" end="00:21:00.480" style="s2">nowadays in many Western cultures now</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.240" end="00:21:03.510" style="s2">you have meditation Eastern style and</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.480" end="00:21:06.360" style="s2">you have yoga which is also has a</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.510" end="00:21:08.899" style="s2">contemplative component to it</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.360" end="00:21:12.419" style="s2">so one road has always been</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.899" end="00:21:15.899" style="s2">contemplation and meditation and you</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.419" end="00:21:18.090" style="s2">find that amongst the original Greek</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.899" end="00:21:22.080" style="s2">philosophers also they had their</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.090" end="00:21:24.570" style="s2">practices of contemplation and then the</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.080" end="00:21:27.630" style="s2">other road has always been expressive</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.570" end="00:21:30.450" style="s2">arts so one is the turning in and</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.630" end="00:21:33.330" style="s2">quieting down and removing from the</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.450" end="00:21:36.390" style="s2">dynamics of life and the other is the</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.330" end="00:21:38.460" style="s2">jumping in and the fully expressing into</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.390" end="00:21:41.640" style="s2">the dynamics of life those are the two</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.460" end="00:21:44.789" style="s2">roads and so part of the experiment is</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.640" end="00:21:48.059" style="s2">to figure out which road a person most</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.789" end="00:21:51.659" style="s2">likely goes on I&#39;m on the expressive</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.059" end="00:21:54.270" style="s2">side I have the Irish gift or curse of</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.659" end="00:21:57.059" style="s2">gab and I&#39;m gonna talk at length about</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.270" end="00:21:58.360" style="s2">almost anything and tell stories and so</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.059" end="00:22:01.030" style="s2">on like that</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.360" end="00:22:04.150" style="s2">and and that&#39;s really a natural practice</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.030" end="00:22:08.050" style="s2">that lines up with you know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.150" end="00:22:11.080" style="s2">inside me trying to come out but because</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.050" end="00:22:13.750" style="s2">I write I go into a very contemplative</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.080" end="00:22:17.320" style="s2">practice when I&#39;m writing I don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.750" end="00:22:20.680" style="s2">anyone I just see words and work with</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.320" end="00:22:22.600" style="s2">that and so my understanding is in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.680" end="00:22:25.540" style="s2">course of life a person&#39;s gonna have to</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.600" end="00:22:28.510" style="s2">learn a series of practices because the</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.540" end="00:22:32.770" style="s2">psyche changes and what was maybe</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.510" end="00:22:35.050" style="s2">primarily meditative suddenly now has to</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.770" end="00:22:38.890" style="s2">get more expressive in order to find</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.050" end="00:22:42.550" style="s2">balance and keep the psyche growing and</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.890" end="00:22:45.850" style="s2">so at least that&#39;s a way to begin so one</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.550" end="00:22:50.140" style="s2">more idea because if you follow the idea</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.850" end="00:22:52.180" style="s2">of a core genius waiting to unfold then</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.140" end="00:22:56.850" style="s2">there are going to be certain practices</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.180" end="00:22:59.200" style="s2">that are natural to a person and and so</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.850" end="00:23:02.530" style="s2">well there&#39;s lots of ways to get into</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.200" end="00:23:04.810" style="s2">that but certain people will find the</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.530" end="00:23:08.350" style="s2">inclination to music where if someone</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.810" end="00:23:10.300" style="s2">will find the inclination to they want</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.350" end="00:23:12.400" style="s2">to be in nature all the time well that</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.300" end="00:23:15.970" style="s2">becomes a practice in the ancient world</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.400" end="00:23:20.320" style="s2">that was a practice and so maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.970" end="00:23:21.420" style="s2">the starting way to think about it thank</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.320" end="00:23:28.810" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.420" end="00:23:31.660" style="s2">rain will you ask a question yeah hi</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.810" end="00:23:35.410" style="s2">Michael thanks for being here my</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.660" end="00:23:40.570" style="s2">question is effectively about the</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.410" end="00:23:42.880" style="s2">ontology of this genius in the I hear an</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.570" end="00:23:46.720" style="s2">implicit individuality in it in a way</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.880" end="00:23:49.720" style="s2">like that genius comes from the soul and</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.720" end="00:23:54.190" style="s2">maybe I&#39;m misunderstanding that but I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.720" end="00:23:58.360" style="s2">love to hear kind of how you how you see</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.190" end="00:24:01.000" style="s2">individuality and is is this genius you</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.360" end="00:24:03.190" style="s2">talk about an individual property or a</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.000" end="00:24:05.710" style="s2">collective property or some negotiation</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.190" end="00:24:08.650" style="s2">between the two thank you great question</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.710" end="00:24:11.059" style="s2">so I see genius has probably the</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.650" end="00:24:13.610" style="s2">uniqueness of a person so</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.059" end="00:24:16.850" style="s2">one of the old ideas is the uniqueness</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.610" end="00:24:19.879" style="s2">of the soul each person born is unique</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.850" end="00:24:23.919" style="s2">from anyone else maybe similar people</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.879" end="00:24:29.230" style="s2">but never that person and part of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.919" end="00:24:32.149" style="s2">salvation of one&#39;s inner troubles is</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.230" end="00:24:35.749" style="s2">learning to be with and express one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.149" end="00:24:37.909" style="s2">uniqueness it&#39;s the essential for any</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.749" end="00:24:41.149" style="s2">kind of expressive art but even I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.909" end="00:24:44.059" style="s2">for a meaningful intellectual work so I</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.149" end="00:24:49.960" style="s2">think it&#39;s something unique to the</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.059" end="00:24:54.019" style="s2">person now the genius needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.960" end="00:24:58.149" style="s2">received by the community or else it</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.019" end="00:25:01.580" style="s2">backfires it backs up so the community</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.149" end="00:25:05.480" style="s2">becomes the receiving part for the</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.580" end="00:25:08.389" style="s2">genius of the individual people and then</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.480" end="00:25:12.409" style="s2">the individual people&#39;s genius is the</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.389" end="00:25:14.600" style="s2">ongoing inspiration and imagination of</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.409" end="00:25:17.360" style="s2">the community so there&#39;s a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.600" end="00:25:21.019" style="s2">between the two if you think of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.360" end="00:25:23.330" style="s2">genius as gifted the talents as gifts</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.019" end="00:25:25.759" style="s2">and other capacities as gifts to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.330" end="00:25:30.649" style="s2">given so that you can imagine</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.759" end="00:25:33.470" style="s2">a instead of a consumer society a</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.649" end="00:25:35.210" style="s2">gift-giving society where everybody has</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.470" end="00:25:37.909" style="s2">helped to give their gifts and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.210" end="00:25:40.999" style="s2">community is the beneficiary of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.909" end="00:25:44.869" style="s2">gifts but then there&#39;s an old idea that</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.999" end="00:25:47.570" style="s2">when you give from the genius you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.869" end="00:25:49.299" style="s2">get less genius you get more that giving</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.570" end="00:25:52.039" style="s2">from the genius intensifies and</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.299" end="00:25:54.710" style="s2">elaborates the capacity of the genius I</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.039" end="00:26:00.080" style="s2">mean that&#39;s one way that I think about</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.710" end="00:26:02.809" style="s2">it and I should say in classic terms and</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.080" end="00:26:06.309" style="s2">in mythology the genius is not human</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.809" end="00:26:09.440" style="s2">it&#39;s a spirit and so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.309" end="00:26:11.389" style="s2">negotiation between the host of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.440" end="00:26:13.820" style="s2">genius and the genius</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.389" end="00:26:16.190" style="s2">for instance I have friends who are</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.820" end="00:26:18.379" style="s2">painters and you know they always want</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.190" end="00:26:21.019" style="s2">to have the next big gallery show and</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.379" end="00:26:22.610" style="s2">when they have the show they&#39;re painting</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.019" end="00:26:24.710" style="s2">right up to the last minute you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.610" end="00:26:26.750" style="s2">people are saying stop stop now I gotta</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.710" end="00:26:28.460" style="s2">one more painting up there well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.750" end="00:26:32.000" style="s2">not the person that&#39;s the genius the</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.460" end="00:26:34.309" style="s2">genius doesn&#39;t care about the body or</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.000" end="00:26:36.890" style="s2">anything like that the genius just wants</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.309" end="00:26:39.020" style="s2">expression so my understanding of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.890" end="00:26:43.429" style="s2">genius it&#39;s a spirit that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.020" end="00:26:46.880" style="s2">negotiate with and it&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.429" end="00:26:49.940" style="s2">transcends the personal and certainly</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.880" end="00:26:54.020" style="s2">cannot be contained or defined by the</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.940" end="00:26:56.649" style="s2">communal the genius is defiant against</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.020" end="00:26:56.649" style="s2">restrictions</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.080" end="00:27:11.710" style="s2">thank you Chris will you ask your</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.190" end="00:27:14.710" style="s2">question hi Michael um I&#39;ve been reading</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.710" end="00:27:19.059" style="s2">Thomas Singer you and that union analyst</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.710" end="00:27:23.140" style="s2">his characterization of cultural</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.059" end="00:27:26.700" style="s2">complexes and I was struck about how he</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.140" end="00:27:30.789" style="s2">says that cultural complexes get</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.700" end="00:27:34.690" style="s2">momentum and we&#39;re in the middle of a</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.789" end="00:27:37.510" style="s2">really strong cultural complex and he</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.690" end="00:27:42.460" style="s2">says they don&#39;t stop until there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.510" end="00:27:46.630" style="s2">force greater than a complex what do you</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.460" end="00:27:50.080" style="s2">think that force may be and it makes me</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.630" end="00:27:53.830" style="s2">somewhat pessimistic because I think it</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.080" end="00:27:59.679" style="s2">won&#39;t be a positive force would you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.830" end="00:28:02.289" style="s2">not hey Chris good question thank you so</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.679" end="00:28:06.130" style="s2">I love that idea of the collectives orc</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.289" end="00:28:10.120" style="s2">complex so here&#39;s one way I&#39;m seeing it</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.130" end="00:28:15.909" style="s2">just to take an example the United</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.120" end="00:28:20.470" style="s2">States is suffering under an exacerbated</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.909" end="00:28:24.070" style="s2">complex of narcissism having elected</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.470" end="00:28:27.640" style="s2">Donald Trump who is an arch narcissist</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.070" end="00:28:28.899" style="s2">to a place of high power which is the</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.640" end="00:28:32.080" style="s2">kind of thing no one should ever do</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.899" end="00:28:34.630" style="s2">because the narcissist can&#39;t help but</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.080" end="00:28:37.659" style="s2">turn everything to themselves and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.630" end="00:28:40.990" style="s2">undermine themselves as well as anything</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.659" end="00:28:43.240" style="s2">else everything else and so this has now</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.990" end="00:28:46.120" style="s2">been mmm</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.240" end="00:28:50.710" style="s2">someone with with really radical</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.120" end="00:28:54.279" style="s2">narcissistic complications is now in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.710" end="00:28:58.120" style="s2">seat of great power and so everything is</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.279" end="00:29:00.480" style="s2">endangered and I&#39;ve been suggesting that</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.120" end="00:29:04.330" style="s2">there&#39;s another thing about narcissism</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.480" end="00:29:07.000" style="s2">narcissistic people can put a spell on</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.330" end="00:29:09.400" style="s2">other people people think that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.000" end="00:29:11.260" style="s2">being receiving attention from them</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.400" end="00:29:13.660" style="s2">narcissus but the narcissus is really</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.260" end="00:29:16.180" style="s2">putting them under what in stories would</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.660" end="00:29:18.460" style="s2">be called a spell so that people begin</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.180" end="00:29:20.440" style="s2">acting out the things that the</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.460" end="00:29:23.880" style="s2">narcissistic person wants this happens</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.440" end="00:29:26.620" style="s2">in families a lot so if you take that</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.880" end="00:29:29.440" style="s2">configuration and you say what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.620" end="00:29:33.430" style="s2">force that could counteract that I would</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.440" end="00:29:38.500" style="s2">say truth I would say truth that that</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.430" end="00:29:41.590" style="s2">the the narcissistic complex distorts</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.500" end="00:29:43.510" style="s2">reality and so what&#39;s needed is truth I</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.590" end="00:29:46.450" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s a bad thing at all I</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.510" end="00:29:51.250" style="s2">think it&#39;s an insane truth I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.450" end="00:29:53.950" style="s2">of the old idea of satyagraha the force</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.250" end="00:29:57.190" style="s2">of truth that&#39;s what Gandhi called it</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.950" end="00:29:59.860" style="s2">when he walked a cloth across India to</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.190" end="00:30:02.890" style="s2">pick up some salt and that was the</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.860" end="00:30:05.740" style="s2">movement that broke the British Raj</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.890" end="00:30:08.190" style="s2">really broke down because of the forth</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.740" end="00:30:10.810" style="s2">of truth force of truth and he called it</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.190" end="00:30:13.480" style="s2">satyagraha so it&#39;s not truth on a</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.810" end="00:30:15.040" style="s2">scientific level per se and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.480" end="00:30:17.710" style="s2">truth in an agreed-upon</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.040" end="00:30:20.860" style="s2">understanding of culture it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.710" end="00:30:23.500" style="s2">penetrating transcendent truth Gandhi</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.860" end="00:30:25.630" style="s2">went against the law because the law was</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.500" end="00:30:29.050" style="s2">you could not take salt the salt was</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.630" end="00:30:31.480" style="s2">owned by the British East India Company</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.050" end="00:30:33.580" style="s2">and any person who took salt was</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.480" end="00:30:34.750" style="s2">violating the law well salt is a</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.580" end="00:30:38.170" style="s2">necessity for life</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.750" end="00:30:39.970" style="s2">and Gandhi understood that and he</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.170" end="00:30:43.810" style="s2">understood that he had to go and break</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.970" end="00:30:46.030" style="s2">that law and said salt is part of what</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.810" end="00:30:48.370" style="s2">anybody needs to live and I&#39;m breaking</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.030" end="00:30:51.730" style="s2">the law on the basis of that truth and</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.370" end="00:30:54.520" style="s2">that brought down the British Raj so I</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.730" end="00:31:01.130" style="s2">think there&#39;s a need for the force of</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.520" end="00:31:04.160" style="s2">truth that&#39;s how I would see things</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.130" end="00:31:06.549" style="s2">thank you maybe will you ask your</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.160" end="00:31:06.549" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.990" end="00:31:15.049" style="s2">hi thanks Michael for being here um</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.890" end="00:31:17.090" style="s2">something that kind of stood up to me in</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.049" end="00:31:20.390" style="s2">your introduction was this talk about</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.090" end="00:31:22.850" style="s2">having like a brush with that like being</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.390" end="00:31:24.919" style="s2">pushed past what you would be willing to</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.850" end="00:31:27.590" style="s2">go through yourself if you were just</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.919" end="00:31:30.410" style="s2">having to choose it in that moment and I</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.590" end="00:31:32.600" style="s2">was wondering how you see like altered</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.410" end="00:31:35.059" style="s2">states of consciousness as being</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.600" end="00:31:37.909" style="s2">connected to initiation rights and other</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.059" end="00:31:41.000" style="s2">transformative events like that great</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.909" end="00:31:44.809" style="s2">question thank you so if I was going to</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.000" end="00:31:47.679" style="s2">study initiation and all alternate</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.809" end="00:31:52.270" style="s2">states of reality I would go</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.679" end="00:31:54.770" style="s2">specifically to shamanic initiation and</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.270" end="00:31:58.390" style="s2">well you could also go to Vision Quest</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.770" end="00:32:00.260" style="s2">Vision Quest is pretty easy place to go</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.390" end="00:32:01.850" style="s2">because they&#39;re still being done the</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.260" end="00:32:04.940" style="s2">United States that&#39;s kind of a revival</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.850" end="00:32:07.039" style="s2">and and the basic idea is you separate</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.940" end="00:32:09.110" style="s2">from everybody and you go and sit in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.039" end="00:32:11.840" style="s2">circle that you&#39;ve made on some Ridge</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.110" end="00:32:15.230" style="s2">somewhere no food maybe a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.840" end="00:32:19.000" style="s2">water nothing else exposed to nature but</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.230" end="00:32:22.100" style="s2">all the ancient people saw nature as</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.000" end="00:32:24.470" style="s2">spirit with the green garment on and so</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.100" end="00:32:26.990" style="s2">you&#39;re really being exposed to the</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.470" end="00:32:31.159" style="s2">alternatives alternative spirit of</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.990" end="00:32:32.929" style="s2">nature and and then the idea is nature</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.159" end="00:32:35.480" style="s2">spirit whatever you want to call it is</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.929" end="00:32:38.120" style="s2">going to bring you something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.480" end="00:32:39.799" style="s2">going to turn out to be a totem animal</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.120" end="00:32:43.309" style="s2">kind of way of understanding your psyche</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.799" end="00:32:46.990" style="s2">or some other experience that alters and</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.309" end="00:32:50.000" style="s2">and breaks through all common</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.990" end="00:32:52.100" style="s2">expectation so that there is a personal</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.000" end="00:32:54.200" style="s2">experience or a personal spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.100" end="00:32:56.090" style="s2">experience it&#39;s not religious because</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.200" end="00:32:58.630" style="s2">there&#39;s no church involved and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.090" end="00:33:01.760" style="s2">no doctrine it&#39;s actually the individual</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.630" end="00:33:03.919" style="s2">opening now if you want to go back</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.760" end="00:33:05.510" style="s2">through the tribal groups you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.919" end="00:33:09.049" style="s2">just opening to nature because nature is</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.510" end="00:33:11.030" style="s2">part of the cosmic system or the cosmos</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.049" end="00:33:13.640" style="s2">and so it&#39;s really the individual</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.030" end="00:33:14.690" style="s2">opening to spirit to nature and to the</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.640" end="00:33:16.870" style="s2">cosmos</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.690" end="00:33:19.880" style="s2">that calls it causes a transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.870" end="00:33:22.040" style="s2">natural transcendence and the person is</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.880" end="00:33:24.380" style="s2">never the same so that would be one way</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.040" end="00:33:28.700" style="s2">to go then you have shamanic initiation</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.380" end="00:33:31.220" style="s2">which is you start the study of that in</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.700" end="00:33:33.860" style="s2">Siberia the word shaman is a Siberian</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.220" end="00:33:37.300" style="s2">word and this is interesting because</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.860" end="00:33:40.820" style="s2">that happens when a person breaks down</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.300" end="00:33:42.500" style="s2">so in the in the writer in the Vision</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.820" end="00:33:45.320" style="s2">Quest you&#39;re you&#39;re going seeking the</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.500" end="00:33:47.750" style="s2">vision in the shamanic thing it could be</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.320" end="00:33:50.030" style="s2">you have a nervous breakdown and then</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.750" end="00:33:52.460" style="s2">the people say oh well she&#39;s broken down</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.030" end="00:33:55.400" style="s2">now so I guess maybe she wants to be a</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.460" end="00:33:58.880" style="s2">shaman so you then go into a whole bunch</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.400" end="00:34:02.480" style="s2">of wild experiences and the core idea is</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.880" end="00:34:04.850" style="s2">that you die by dismemberment so you can</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.480" end="00:34:07.730" style="s2">see how it could align with an emotional</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.850" end="00:34:11.600" style="s2">breakdown or even a psychological</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.730" end="00:34:15.230" style="s2">disorder because the imagery is that a</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.600" end="00:34:20.180" style="s2">person is dismembered and then put back</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.230" end="00:34:22.460" style="s2">together by the spirits and put back</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.180" end="00:34:25.820" style="s2">together in a way that they&#39;re different</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.460" end="00:34:29.570" style="s2">often they the imagery is that they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.820" end="00:34:33.220" style="s2">put certain crystals at the joints so</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.570" end="00:34:36.980" style="s2">the person now doesn&#39;t just have bodily</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.220" end="00:34:40.460" style="s2">joints sinews they also have crystals</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.980" end="00:34:43.760" style="s2">there as if to say they have been remade</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.460" end="00:34:47.450" style="s2">through mineral substance and then they</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.760" end="00:34:49.460" style="s2">become the people who can when someone</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.450" end="00:34:51.920" style="s2">gets lost which in the ancient world</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.460" end="00:34:53.870" style="s2">would mean you lost your soul they have</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.920" end="00:34:58.760" style="s2">the capacity to go find them because</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.870" end="00:35:00.770" style="s2">they&#39;re now able to not just communicate</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.760" end="00:35:03.110" style="s2">but transit through the other worlds and</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.770" end="00:35:06.860" style="s2">so there&#39;s a whole field of study there</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.110" end="00:35:10.210" style="s2">that is anthropological for the most</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.860" end="00:35:12.050" style="s2">part but you can see the psychological</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.210" end="00:35:15.830" style="s2">reverberations of it right away</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.050" end="00:35:19.420" style="s2">and so if you want to relate it to</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.830" end="00:35:22.760" style="s2">drug-taking for which people do for</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.420" end="00:35:25.280" style="s2">vision and for transcending personality</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.760" end="00:35:27.470" style="s2">and so on it fits into that shamanic</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.280" end="00:35:28.370" style="s2">realm where there&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.470" end="00:35:31.220" style="s2">something that</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.370" end="00:35:33.560" style="s2">completely alters the person but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.220" end="00:35:36.620" style="s2">also useful for someone who has had a</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.560" end="00:35:38.570" style="s2">breakdown they&#39;re separated by that</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.620" end="00:35:41.480" style="s2">breakdown they&#39;re thrown into an</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.570" end="00:35:44.960" style="s2">extremely mental condition how did they</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.480" end="00:35:47.450" style="s2">come back having a diagnosis and getting</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.960" end="00:35:49.850" style="s2">some drugs that doesn&#39;t bring them back</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.450" end="00:35:52.600" style="s2">they&#39;re not in community but if they</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.850" end="00:35:56.240" style="s2">were understood to be now open to other</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.600" end="00:35:59.630" style="s2">unusual visions you bring them back as a</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.240" end="00:36:02.270" style="s2">visionary and and suddenly they now</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.630" end="00:36:05.240" style="s2">serve a function in this greater sense</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.270" end="00:36:10.850" style="s2">of community ah so I hope that&#39;s helpful</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.240" end="00:36:17.870" style="s2">with that rayo</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.850" end="00:36:20.330" style="s2">where you ask your question yes thank</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.870" end="00:36:22.700" style="s2">you Michael for being here I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.330" end="00:36:26.030" style="s2">this kind of goes along with what you</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.700" end="00:36:29.930" style="s2">just said I feel like I personally am</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.030" end="00:36:30.470" style="s2">going through like a season of death</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.930" end="00:36:33.530" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.470" end="00:36:35.660" style="s2">kind of like dismantling and in my</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.530" end="00:36:39.050" style="s2">experience many people are uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.660" end="00:36:42.080" style="s2">or afraid of this idea of dying even</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.050" end="00:36:45.410" style="s2">though to me it seems very essential for</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.080" end="00:36:48.770" style="s2">self transcendence and then contributing</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.410" end="00:36:50.990" style="s2">to communitas so do you have any advice</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.770" end="00:36:54.650" style="s2">on how to be in right relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.990" end="00:36:56.690" style="s2">the concept of death in order for us</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.650" end="00:36:58.990" style="s2">individually and collectively to step</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.690" end="00:37:03.050" style="s2">through this threshold to be reborn</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.990" end="00:37:04.520" style="s2">really good question thank you so if</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.050" end="00:37:08.300" style="s2">we&#39;re looking at it through the lens of</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.520" end="00:37:11.420" style="s2">rites of passage and so the rites of</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.300" end="00:37:14.620" style="s2">passage dynamic starts in youth and the</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.420" end="00:37:17.630" style="s2">idea is you don&#39;t outgrow childhood</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.620" end="00:37:21.640" style="s2">childhood has to die that&#39;s the old idea</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.630" end="00:37:25.220" style="s2">and so there would be a brush with death</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.640" end="00:37:30.520" style="s2">that could be like in the initiation of</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.220" end="00:37:33.970" style="s2">girls and certain tribes in Africa the</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.520" end="00:37:37.270" style="s2">actually girl</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.970" end="00:37:40.780" style="s2">women are initiated individually to</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.270" end="00:37:42.420" style="s2">begin with boys start out as a group and</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.780" end="00:37:44.980" style="s2">then they try to find the individuality</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.420" end="00:37:48.550" style="s2">the girls go when they have their first</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.980" end="00:37:51.220" style="s2">menses what and and what is the menses</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.550" end="00:37:52.990" style="s2">but blood going through the body and</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.220" end="00:37:56.050" style="s2">taking out eggs that could have been</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.990" end="00:37:58.569" style="s2">life that now go in the direction of</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.050" end="00:38:01.420" style="s2">death it&#39;s so that the beginning of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.569" end="00:38:04.119" style="s2">initiation would be the recognition that</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.420" end="00:38:06.760" style="s2">the girl is now a woman and as a woman</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.119" end="00:38:09.940" style="s2">she knows both life and death inside her</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.760" end="00:38:12.730" style="s2">body and then and then they would so</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.940" end="00:38:14.410" style="s2">then you would go out usually you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.730" end="00:38:18.819" style="s2">taken away from the village it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.410" end="00:38:21.730" style="s2">happens out in nature and go into a</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.819" end="00:38:23.890" style="s2">quiet dark Hut and be in darkness for a</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.730" end="00:38:27.130" style="s2">while darkness equates to death</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.890" end="00:38:29.470" style="s2">absence invisibility sometimes they</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.130" end="00:38:32.619" style="s2">would be put in tight inside of a sacred</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.470" end="00:38:35.980" style="s2">tree that was hollow as if going back</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.619" end="00:38:38.290" style="s2">into the womb and that&#39;s the same place</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.980" end="00:38:41.170" style="s2">that all the other women were when they</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.290" end="00:38:44.040" style="s2">were becoming themselves and then so you</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.170" end="00:38:46.270" style="s2">have this two sides to it one is death</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.040" end="00:38:49.240" style="s2">childhoods over you&#39;ll never be that</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.270" end="00:38:52.780" style="s2">child again and and then the other is</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.240" end="00:38:55.390" style="s2">embryonic be like an embryo and so then</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.780" end="00:38:58.780" style="s2">the young woman would be inside the tree</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.390" end="00:39:01.890" style="s2">and this is an in demo tribe in what</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.780" end="00:39:05.079" style="s2">used to be well it&#39;s the Congo now and</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.890" end="00:39:08.109" style="s2">and then all the women come and feed her</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.079" end="00:39:10.030" style="s2">as if she&#39;s an embryo and they give give</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.109" end="00:39:13.089" style="s2">her actual food and they tell all the</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.030" end="00:39:15.240" style="s2">stories of the feminine and all the</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.089" end="00:39:19.270" style="s2">things that they know so she&#39;s getting</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.240" end="00:39:23.109" style="s2">psychological and food and ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.270" end="00:39:24.579" style="s2">mythological food and she would be in</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.109" end="00:39:26.650" style="s2">there for a certain amount of time and</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.579" end="00:39:28.660" style="s2">then she would come out of the tree as</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.650" end="00:39:31.060" style="s2">if she was being born into the world as</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.660" end="00:39:34.930" style="s2">a new person and the whole tribe had to</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.060" end="00:39:38.710" style="s2">come and see the new person so so the</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.930" end="00:39:42.400" style="s2">idea was you have to die to become a new</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.710" end="00:39:45.550" style="s2">person and so one way to think about the</p>

<p begin="00:41:21.070" end="00:41:25.570" style="s2">got it in under the wire so it&#39;s good to</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.260" end="00:41:27.550" style="s2">see you again I have another question</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.570" end="00:41:29.170" style="s2">about individuation and the collective</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.550" end="00:41:31.450" style="s2">and you already kind of addressed this</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.170" end="00:41:34.690" style="s2">but maybe I can put a slightly different</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.450" end="00:41:37.540" style="s2">tilt on it I definitely resonate with</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.690" end="00:41:39.610" style="s2">your any one of your main themes of</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.540" end="00:41:41.590" style="s2">we&#39;re living in an age or individuation</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.610" end="00:41:44.020" style="s2">and people expressing their genius as</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.590" end="00:41:45.790" style="s2">what&#39;s called for rather than a you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.020" end="00:41:49.450" style="s2">a collective political movement or a</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.790" end="00:41:51.790" style="s2">single idea or ideology or belief system</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.450" end="00:41:54.370" style="s2">and when I preached that a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.790" end="00:41:55.900" style="s2">pushback I get from others is no no this</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.370" end="00:41:58.600" style="s2">is an age of where the collective is</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.900" end="00:41:59.350" style="s2">called for more than at any other time</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.600" end="00:42:01.330" style="s2">and we&#39;re reeling</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.350" end="00:42:04.650" style="s2">to lead with the collective and find</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.330" end="00:42:07.330" style="s2">ways to come together with some</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.650" end="00:42:09.250" style="s2">collective you know they may not use the</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.330" end="00:42:11.920" style="s2">word ideology but they&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.250" end="00:42:15.160" style="s2">pointing to that so I&#39;m wondering how do</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.920" end="00:42:16.930" style="s2">you talk about individuation in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.160" end="00:42:18.250" style="s2">the collective and I know it&#39;s a tricky</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.930" end="00:42:21.130" style="s2">thing is it&#39;s hard it&#39;s almost like a</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.250" end="00:42:23.410" style="s2">circular thing because people expressing</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.130" end="00:42:26.410" style="s2">their genius will be doing collective</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.410" end="00:42:29.410" style="s2">things and forming a community oz as you</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.410" end="00:42:32.350" style="s2">said so it&#39;s always her kind of hard to</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.410" end="00:42:33.880" style="s2">talk about and in trying to make this</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.350" end="00:42:37.990" style="s2">point so I&#39;m wondering how you see those</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.880" end="00:42:42.430" style="s2">those two I&#39;m really familiar with that</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.990" end="00:42:45.160" style="s2">conversation so my way of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.430" end="00:42:50.350" style="s2">that is that the two are not opposed</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.160" end="00:42:53.530" style="s2">that&#39;s a misunderstanding so I would</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.350" end="00:42:56.080" style="s2">start with the idea no change at the</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.530" end="00:43:01.150" style="s2">level of the individual soul no change</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.080" end="00:43:03.790" style="s2">in the world so I&#39;m saying it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.150" end="00:43:06.670" style="s2">complicated but</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.790" end="00:43:10.510" style="s2">logically each soul is connected to the</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.670" end="00:43:13.930" style="s2">soul of the world the old idea was anima</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.510" end="00:43:16.810" style="s2">Mundi the world is alive and it has its</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.930" end="00:43:19.450" style="s2">own soul and we each have our own soul</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.810" end="00:43:21.400" style="s2">and there&#39;s a secret connection from the</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.450" end="00:43:25.690" style="s2">individual soul to the soul of the world</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.400" end="00:43:29.050" style="s2">so when there&#39;s an a greater awakening</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.690" end="00:43:32.110" style="s2">of individual souls it generates the</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.050" end="00:43:34.030" style="s2">energy and the ideas and images for</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.110" end="00:43:38.950" style="s2">changing the collective and even</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.030" end="00:43:42.730" style="s2">changing the world and so to me for</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.950" end="00:43:46.240" style="s2">instance there cannot be a single idea</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.730" end="00:43:47.800" style="s2">or an ideology to me ideology is what</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.240" end="00:43:50.170" style="s2">you get when you&#39;ve lost your</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.800" end="00:43:52.840" style="s2">imagination that&#39;s what I think ideology</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.170" end="00:43:55.420" style="s2">is not a high level of awareness as far</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.840" end="00:43:57.820" style="s2">as I&#39;m concerned so there&#39;s no ideology</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.420" end="00:44:00.520" style="s2">there&#39;s no new political party there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.820" end="00:44:03.250" style="s2">no single thing now the problems are too</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.520" end="00:44:06.460" style="s2">big too complicated to historically</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.250" end="00:44:11.050" style="s2">driven that it has to become a very</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.460" end="00:44:13.720" style="s2">complex response and so then the way and</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.050" end="00:44:15.940" style="s2">I grew up in the 60s and was part of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.720" end="00:44:18.730" style="s2">collective revolution where we thought</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.940" end="00:44:20.530" style="s2">politics could do a lot and it really</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.730" end="00:44:22.390" style="s2">didn&#39;t come all the way through and the</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.530" end="00:44:25.360" style="s2">same issues that were there then are</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.390" end="00:44:28.870" style="s2">back now with a vengeance and politics</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.360" end="00:44:30.550" style="s2">is less abled now in certain ways so not</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.870" end="00:44:32.140" style="s2">that people shouldn&#39;t be political and</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.550" end="00:44:34.480" style="s2">vote for the right folks and do all that</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.140" end="00:44:38.050" style="s2">stuff but something else was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.480" end="00:44:41.830" style="s2">happen and it has to happen from the</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.050" end="00:44:44.470" style="s2">unique souls of people and then that</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.830" end="00:44:46.510" style="s2">movement into the world from that inner</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.470" end="00:44:49.590" style="s2">uniqueness is what changes the world and</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.510" end="00:44:49.590" style="s2">so for instance</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.730" end="00:44:56.570" style="s2">the United States we have some people in</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.720" end="00:44:58.340" style="s2">high positions of authority in states</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.570" end="00:45:01.520" style="s2">and in the federal government that shift</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.340" end="00:45:04.700" style="s2">should not be there they don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.520" end="00:45:07.640" style="s2">awakened sense of humanity they don&#39;t in</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.700" end="00:45:11.240" style="s2">some cases have any empathy some of them</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.640" end="00:45:12.890" style="s2">lack sympathy and so therefore they</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.240" end="00:45:16.250" style="s2">cannot act in the interest of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.890" end="00:45:19.250" style="s2">collective they just can&#39;t so what that</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.250" end="00:45:22.280" style="s2">tells me is that some people are going</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.250" end="00:45:25.460" style="s2">to have to wake up and become more</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.280" end="00:45:27.910" style="s2">conscious of their own capacity to be a</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.460" end="00:45:30.320" style="s2">leader in the collective political sense</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.910" end="00:45:33.440" style="s2">that would be part of the individual</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.320" end="00:45:35.750" style="s2">awakening as well in other words Martin</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.440" end="00:45:38.540" style="s2">Luther King who is a very distinct</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.750" end="00:45:41.600" style="s2">individual keeps awakening in the course</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.540" end="00:45:43.910" style="s2">of his his political career but also his</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.600" end="00:45:45.619" style="s2">earlier religious career he keeps</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.910" end="00:45:48.170" style="s2">awakening to greater and greater things</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.619" end="00:45:50.390" style="s2">until he has the dream of the next world</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.170" end="00:45:52.580" style="s2">which at least he can pronounce and in</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.390" end="00:45:54.710" style="s2">pronouncing and he even says I may not</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.580" end="00:45:58.910" style="s2">get there that&#39;s the sign of the leader</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.710" end="00:46:01.609" style="s2">understanding the process and so it</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.910" end="00:46:03.410" style="s2">seems to me that when individuals awaken</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.609" end="00:46:06.740" style="s2">some of them will be natural leaders</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.410" end="00:46:08.990" style="s2">they will have the capacity and the aim</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.740" end="00:46:11.630" style="s2">and the inclination and they just then</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.990" end="00:46:13.550" style="s2">have to have the heart break open so</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.630" end="00:46:15.560" style="s2">that have they have enough heartfelt</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.550" end="00:46:18.740" style="s2">sense to use the talents and the skills</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.560" end="00:46:23.270" style="s2">in a way that benefit everyone else so I</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.740" end="00:46:26.030" style="s2">think the dichotomy between the the</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.270" end="00:46:30.020" style="s2">fascination with a an ideology or</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.030" end="00:46:31.310" style="s2">political movement and the uniqueness of</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.020" end="00:46:33.109" style="s2">the individual and souls of false</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.310" end="00:46:35.690" style="s2">dichotomy I think when enough people</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.109" end="00:46:39.050" style="s2">awaken that will include the awakening</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.690" end="00:46:41.240" style="s2">of natural leaders and and and then</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.050" end="00:46:44.060" style="s2">people with in India they called it the</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.240" end="00:46:46.790" style="s2">Dhamma actually the interesting old idea</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.060" end="00:46:49.580" style="s2">was as spod Dhamma and it meant the</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.790" end="00:46:52.640" style="s2">individual Dhamma awakening to the way I</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.580" end="00:46:55.160" style="s2">am intended to serve the world and so</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.640" end="00:46:57.770" style="s2">what would really change politics that</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.160" end="00:46:59.660" style="s2">people and it doesn&#39;t matter their</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.770" end="00:47:01.730" style="s2">background or their orientation or</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.660" end="00:47:02.970" style="s2">anything it matters their genius if</p>

<p begin="00:47:02.970" end="00:47:06.960" style="s2">who had a genius for leading were in</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.590" end="00:47:09.870" style="s2">positions of power that would make</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.960" end="00:47:12.350" style="s2">communitas more possible so that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.870" end="00:47:12.350" style="s2">sense of it</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.210" end="00:47:22.769" style="s2">Natalia will you ask your question thank</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.410" end="00:47:24.390" style="s2">you I might also great to be here I</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.769" end="00:47:26.160" style="s2">really admire your work</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.390" end="00:47:30.809" style="s2">I&#39;m wondering if you could talk about</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.160" end="00:47:32.730" style="s2">the role of lineage and tradition in</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.809" end="00:47:34.410" style="s2">this moment and in the process of</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.730" end="00:47:39.150" style="s2">initiation so in some of these examples</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.410" end="00:47:42.269" style="s2">of the liminal rituals you give with the</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.150" end="00:47:44.490" style="s2">shamans and the denver tribe there</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.269" end="00:47:47.009" style="s2">obviously have this community practice</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.490" end="00:47:50.130" style="s2">of how to help people through these</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.009" end="00:47:52.650" style="s2">liminal stages but obviously today</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.130" end="00:47:56.069" style="s2">there&#39;s both too many traditions and</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.650" end="00:47:58.109" style="s2">people are very fractured from them so</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.069" end="00:48:00.720" style="s2">I&#39;m wondering to what extent is it</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.109" end="00:48:03.900" style="s2">important to have to be initiated</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.720" end="00:48:06.960" style="s2">through a master or lineage and also</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.900" end="00:48:09.660" style="s2">kind of what happens to lineages and</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.960" end="00:48:13.859" style="s2">traditions more broadly in a time of</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.660" end="00:48:17.309" style="s2">kind of a collective liminal collapse</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.859" end="00:48:19.440" style="s2">and transformation really good questions</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.309" end="00:48:20.819" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if I have a really good</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.440" end="00:48:26.250" style="s2">answer</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.819" end="00:48:29.130" style="s2">so start with an anecdote so once I was</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.250" end="00:48:32.220" style="s2">in a car we were driving three and a</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.130" end="00:48:34.529" style="s2">half four hours from the airport to a</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.220" end="00:48:37.109" style="s2">remote camp we were going to have this</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.529" end="00:48:41.700" style="s2">really radical conference and in the car</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.109" end="00:48:48.380" style="s2">was an African medicine man with lineage</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.700" end="00:48:51.779" style="s2">from the tribe a Buddhist teacher and</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.380" end="00:48:55.799" style="s2">practitioner with absolute lineage way</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.779" end="00:48:58.430" style="s2">back in he was an American but had</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.799" end="00:49:07.440" style="s2">really been trained and initiated in</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.430" end="00:49:12.859" style="s2">India a radical activist poet with</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.440" end="00:49:12.859" style="s2">Native American and Latino background</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.019" end="00:49:25.679" style="s2">and a Zen monk who was a lineage lineage</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.079" end="00:49:29.399" style="s2">carrot Karia in Japan and myself and it</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.679" end="00:49:31.109" style="s2">was the Buddhist leader who said how</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.399" end="00:49:32.939" style="s2">about we have three and a half hours how</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.109" end="00:49:35.309" style="s2">about we each talk about our lineage of</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.939" end="00:49:36.779" style="s2">course he was quite comfortable with</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.309" end="00:49:39.089" style="s2">that because he had a distinct lineage</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.779" end="00:49:41.999" style="s2">which he gave the the description of how</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.089" end="00:49:44.849" style="s2">he went got initiated and so on then the</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.999" end="00:49:47.219" style="s2">african tribesmen talked about his</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.849" end="00:49:48.899" style="s2">initiation and and how that connected to</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.219" end="00:49:52.079" style="s2">the ancestors and how the ancestors</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.899" end="00:49:56.069" style="s2">connected to the spirits of nature and</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.079" end="00:49:58.739" style="s2">then the Zen master gave his description</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.069" end="00:50:00.630" style="s2">of receiving the cloth of the lineage</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.739" end="00:50:02.880" style="s2">which had been passed down for hundreds</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.630" end="00:50:06.269" style="s2">and hundreds of years and then the</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.880" end="00:50:09.089" style="s2">Latino poet activists and I looked at</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.269" end="00:50:12.059" style="s2">each other and said what do we say and</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.089" end="00:50:14.849" style="s2">so he good friend of mine Louise</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.059" end="00:50:18.899" style="s2">Rodriguez he talked about his lineage in</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.849" end="00:50:21.569" style="s2">both poetry and in politics in in in</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.899" end="00:50:26.489" style="s2">activist politics but also then his</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.569" end="00:50:29.279" style="s2">lineage by virtue of having both Latino</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.489" end="00:50:31.529" style="s2">blood and his mother was from the the</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.279" end="00:50:34.829" style="s2">Tara Mara a tribe in southern Mexico so</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.529" end="00:50:37.949" style="s2">he had native tradition and and Mexican</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.829" end="00:50:41.579" style="s2">Latino type tradition and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.949" end="00:50:43.079" style="s2">where he went and then I I was really</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.579" end="00:50:45.149" style="s2">happy to be last because I was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.079" end="00:50:48.479" style="s2">figure out what&#39;s my lineage and so</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.149" end="00:50:51.479" style="s2">where I went to I started naming William</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.479" end="00:50:53.729" style="s2">Blake or William Butler Yeats and then</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.479" end="00:50:56.479" style="s2">and back to the old Irish on Aki&#39;s who</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.729" end="00:50:59.429" style="s2">were the seer storytellers and saying</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.479" end="00:51:01.919" style="s2">none of these people do I actually know</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.429" end="00:51:04.049" style="s2">but they are my lineage because I had to</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.919" end="00:51:08.399" style="s2">build my lineage because I wasn&#39;t part</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.049" end="00:51:10.859" style="s2">of any tradition per se and so in a way</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.399" end="00:51:14.419" style="s2">that&#39;s those are the options you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.859" end="00:51:17.309" style="s2">you can go the route of one of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.419" end="00:51:20.249" style="s2">religious or spiritual practices and</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.309" end="00:51:22.589" style="s2">then you can develop lineage that way or</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.249" end="00:51:24.539" style="s2">be pulled into lineage through rituals</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.589" end="00:51:25.400" style="s2">which was the case with this design</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.539" end="00:51:27.260" style="s2">master</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.400" end="00:51:30.590" style="s2">you could be born in a tribe somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.260" end="00:51:33.350" style="s2">and then you&#39;ll get lineage or if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.590" end="00:51:35.720" style="s2">you know like I call it the outsider</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.350" end="00:51:37.460" style="s2">you&#39;re outside the current culture</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.720" end="00:51:40.370" style="s2">you&#39;re outside the traditional culture</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.460" end="00:51:43.970" style="s2">you you then have to find your lineage</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.370" end="00:51:47.480" style="s2">by virtue of imagination and by virtual</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.970" end="00:51:50.990" style="s2">understanding the NE the inner lines of</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.480" end="00:51:54.770" style="s2">the self to find lineage and so in my</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.990" end="00:51:59.360" style="s2">sense lineage is it really a large thing</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.770" end="00:52:04.160" style="s2">I don&#39;t know exactly what happens inside</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.360" end="00:52:06.500" style="s2">the lineage groups now and how they deal</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.160" end="00:52:09.260" style="s2">with all this stuff some of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.500" end="00:52:13.010" style="s2">traditions have in the lineage practices</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.260" end="00:52:16.730" style="s2">they have a like a wild card like in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.010" end="00:52:20.180" style="s2">Zen tradition it was Iike you is called</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.730" end="00:52:22.340" style="s2">the the criminal monk he&#39;s part of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.180" end="00:52:24.590" style="s2">tradition but he did all his meditating</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.340" end="00:52:27.650" style="s2">in the tavern and so but he&#39;s included</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.590" end="00:52:31.780" style="s2">so they have like a wild card for how</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.650" end="00:52:34.040" style="s2">you deal with unexpected periods of time</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.780" end="00:52:40.820" style="s2">but the other thing I&#39;ve been working on</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.040" end="00:52:43.610" style="s2">is the outsider and so it starts in in</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.820" end="00:52:45.800" style="s2">India which with what some people call</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.610" end="00:52:48.710" style="s2">the outcasts but originally they were</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.800" end="00:52:52.400" style="s2">called the outsiders and so the idea I</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.710" end="00:52:54.410" style="s2">did there is if new ideas if new</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.400" end="00:52:57.110" style="s2">imaginations are coming into a culture</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.410" end="00:53:00.110" style="s2">they can&#39;t come in through the people</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.110" end="00:53:02.930" style="s2">who see themselves and feel themselves</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.110" end="00:53:05.240" style="s2">to be in the culture status quo as it is</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.930" end="00:53:08.710" style="s2">they come in through the outsiders and</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.240" end="00:53:11.390" style="s2">so I think there&#39;s a way to reimagine</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.710" end="00:53:16.190" style="s2">being an outsider in the culture as</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.390" end="00:53:18.110" style="s2">being a point of transmission for</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.190" end="00:53:20.810" style="s2">knowledge trying to enter the world and</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.110" end="00:53:22.490" style="s2">as being a messenger so maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.810" end="00:53:26.200" style="s2">helpful so that&#39;s what I&#39;m working on</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.490" end="00:53:29.060" style="s2">now is outsiders because we have less</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.200" end="00:53:32.810" style="s2">structural lineal linear lineage</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.060" end="00:53:35.410" style="s2">processes now in modern cultures so</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.810" end="00:53:39.500" style="s2">anyway I hope that helps</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.410" end="00:53:41.839" style="s2">thank you this brings up a question that</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.500" end="00:53:44.599" style="s2">has been really alive for me and some of</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.839" end="00:53:48.710" style="s2">my conversations recently and that is on</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.599" end="00:53:51.260" style="s2">the cultural appropriation versus what</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.710" end="00:53:53.060" style="s2">is cultural appreciation and I&#39;m curious</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.260" end="00:53:57.020" style="s2">in Europe like in your experience with</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.060" end="00:53:59.089" style="s2">different cultures in my community</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.020" end="00:54:00.670" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of desire to participate</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.089" end="00:54:05.540" style="s2">more fully in some of these rich</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.670" end="00:54:08.349" style="s2">cultures to learn from the way that they</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.540" end="00:54:10.910" style="s2">connect with the arts or with the land</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.349" end="00:54:12.560" style="s2">and there&#39;s also like a sensitivity of</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.910" end="00:54:14.900" style="s2">like Oh am i doing it wrong or like is</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.560" end="00:54:17.210" style="s2">this this this isn&#39;t my I shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.900" end="00:54:19.910" style="s2">there&#39;s kind of this some sensitivity</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.210" end="00:54:25.990" style="s2">around this whatever you might call that</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.910" end="00:54:25.990" style="s2">that um this cultural appropriation</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.589" end="00:54:30.859" style="s2">people cracking down on that so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.940" end="00:54:34.690" style="s2">curious if you have any perspectives or</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.859" end="00:54:37.579" style="s2">wisdom thoughts you might share on that</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.690" end="00:54:40.910" style="s2">it&#39;s an important question is it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.579" end="00:54:44.119" style="s2">serious issue so the first thing that I</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.910" end="00:54:47.060" style="s2">see if someone is saying we don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.119" end="00:54:51.829" style="s2">you messing with our traditions then</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.060" end="00:54:55.130" style="s2">that that has to be respected and and</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.829" end="00:54:58.060" style="s2">maybe there are meeting places like I</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.130" end="00:55:04.130" style="s2">have a friend who wound up in a</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.060" end="00:55:06.980" style="s2">traditional Buddhist temple but he sat</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.130" end="00:55:09.500" style="s2">outside in the rain and the cold and and</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.980" end="00:55:12.260" style="s2">the heat of the Sun for days before he</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.500" end="00:55:14.480" style="s2">got invited in so sometimes you just</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.260" end="00:55:19.460" style="s2">have to be nearby and be respectful and</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.480" end="00:55:22.250" style="s2">then the door opens but on the other</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.460" end="00:55:25.130" style="s2">hand there are traditional groups that</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.250" end="00:55:27.410" style="s2">want to give you what they have most of</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.130" end="00:55:30.290" style="s2">West Africa is that way the tradition is</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.410" end="00:55:32.839" style="s2">in West Africa is whatever we have was</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.290" end="00:55:35.359" style="s2">given to us by spirit we&#39;ll give it to</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.839" end="00:55:38.359" style="s2">you as well so my first drum teacher was</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.359" end="00:55:40.010" style="s2">that way you know someone actually tried</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.359" end="00:55:42.619" style="s2">to try to take a drum away from me when</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.010" end="00:55:44.540" style="s2">I was drumming in this event and I</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.619" end="00:55:46.069" style="s2">instinctively held on to it and then I</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.540" end="00:55:48.440" style="s2">went back to the teacher and said well</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.069" end="00:55:50.390" style="s2">these people thought that</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.440" end="00:55:51.740" style="s2">I was a white person playing African</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.390" end="00:55:53.569" style="s2">music and they would try to take the</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.740" end="00:55:55.460" style="s2">drum away and he said did you give it to</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.569" end="00:55:57.980" style="s2">him I said no goes oh you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.460" end="00:56:00.470" style="s2">he said no one owns drumming it was</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.980" end="00:56:02.030" style="s2">giving to me I gave it to you if you</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.470" end="00:56:04.700" style="s2">want to give it away go ahead if you</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.030" end="00:56:09.440" style="s2">don&#39;t then you know stay on the horse of</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.700" end="00:56:10.819" style="s2">the drum so there&#39;s one idea and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.440" end="00:56:13.599" style="s2">know I mean it&#39;s a big thing to study</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.819" end="00:56:19.609" style="s2">and a person has to be respectful and</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.599" end="00:56:21.950" style="s2">aware in the storytelling tradition the</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.609" end="00:56:24.369" style="s2">storytellers certain kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.950" end="00:56:27.079" style="s2">storytellers went between the tribes</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.369" end="00:56:30.020" style="s2">went all around they had passage and</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.079" end="00:56:32.210" style="s2">sometimes they wore a cloak of several</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.020" end="00:56:35.240" style="s2">colors or they had something a feather</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.210" end="00:56:37.670" style="s2">that indicated that they were moving</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.240" end="00:56:39.619" style="s2">between the lineages and the tribes</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.670" end="00:56:44.960" style="s2">because there needs to be communication</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.619" end="00:56:47.950" style="s2">and cross pollenization also but here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.960" end="00:56:51.650" style="s2">an anecdote I was doing a workshop and</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.950" end="00:56:56.240" style="s2">up in the northwest where I live but</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.650" end="00:56:57.740" style="s2">north of where I am and and into the</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.240" end="00:57:02.839" style="s2">back of the room during the workshop</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.740" end="00:57:05.119" style="s2">came a number of native people from</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.839" end="00:57:06.619" style="s2">Lummi Nation and I&#39;ve worked at Lummi</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.119" end="00:57:08.900" style="s2">Nation I work with their young people</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.619" end="00:57:12.920" style="s2">work with their elders and so they visit</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.900" end="00:57:15.950" style="s2">if I&#39;m around and it was right after</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.920" end="00:57:18.440" style="s2">they got in that I had everybody had</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.950" end="00:57:21.650" style="s2">been singing a chant from Africa and</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.440" end="00:57:24.770" style="s2">then someone got up and asked are we</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.650" end="00:57:27.200" style="s2">doing cultural appropriation by singing</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.770" end="00:57:28.970" style="s2">someone else&#39;s song and I said well</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.200" end="00:57:31.960" style="s2">actually I have permission to share that</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.970" end="00:57:35.569" style="s2">song from the tribe tribal members I</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.960" end="00:57:38.020" style="s2">said but we have some people from Lummi</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.569" end="00:57:41.630" style="s2">Nation here so maybe we should ask them</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.020" end="00:57:43.819" style="s2">are we doing some kind of cultural</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.630" end="00:57:46.400" style="s2">appropriation and they got together and</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.819" end="00:57:49.520" style="s2">had a talk and then afterwards and I was</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.400" end="00:57:52.010" style="s2">waiting curiously maybe even uneasily to</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.520" end="00:57:53.839" style="s2">find out they they might say cut it out</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.010" end="00:57:56.810" style="s2">Michael you you&#39;re doing too much of</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.839" end="00:57:58.520" style="s2">this or something but then the one of</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.810" end="00:58:00.470" style="s2">the aunties they call him auntie she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.520" end="00:58:01.829" style="s2">an elder she stood up and she said well</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.470" end="00:58:04.940" style="s2">we discussed it</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.829" end="00:58:07.969" style="s2">and we don&#39;t mind cultural appropriation</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.940" end="00:58:10.200" style="s2">we don&#39;t what we mind is cultural</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.969" end="00:58:13.469" style="s2">misappropriation it was a great</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.200" end="00:58:16.369" style="s2">distinction and she said we know that</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.469" end="00:58:19.259" style="s2">certain people are using traditions to</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.369" end="00:58:20.400" style="s2">benefit the modern situation to open</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.259" end="00:58:22.739" style="s2">people&#39;s hearts and minds</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.400" end="00:58:26.400" style="s2">and so we judge by what the result is</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.739" end="00:58:28.650" style="s2">not by what the premise is and so we</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.400" end="00:58:31.709" style="s2">come here because we know what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.650" end="00:58:34.170" style="s2">to happen here and and then they offer</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.709" end="00:58:36.900" style="s2">the song themselves in their native</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.170" end="00:58:38.219" style="s2">language so so I think the distinction</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.900" end="00:58:41.519" style="s2">between appropriation and</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.219" end="00:58:46.109" style="s2">misappropriation is good and I think the</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.519" end="00:58:47.789" style="s2">distinction between do people want to do</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.109" end="00:58:50.450" style="s2">they want to share or is it something</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.789" end="00:58:50.450" style="s2">they&#39;re preserving</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.800" end="00:58:54.010" style="s2">those are some thoughts thank you that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.440" end="00:58:57.210" style="s2">helpful</p>

<p begin="00:59:20.920" end="00:59:26.200" style="s2">really I think the transition to a</p>
