<p begin="00:00:12.920" end="00:00:19.789" style="s2">them keep breaking down to new solutions</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.990" end="00:00:21.440" style="s2">firstly a book with expert level</p>

<p begin="00:00:33.770" end="00:00:38.840" style="s2">you want to solve those problems look in</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.380" end="00:00:41.120" style="s2">the mirror it starts with you listening</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.840" end="00:00:43.250" style="s2">to somebody first and understanding so</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.120" end="00:00:45.530" style="s2">conversation is the core element it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.250" end="00:00:47.899" style="s2">the building block for all of this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.530" end="00:00:50.300" style="s2">and a competition to actually have them</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.899" end="00:00:53.180" style="s2">on a social media site designed around</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.300" end="00:00:54.949" style="s2">long-form good-faith dialogue the best</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.180" end="00:00:57.140" style="s2">conversations that I was having was</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.949" end="00:01:00.079" style="s2">around the dinner table with my friends</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.140" end="00:01:02.420" style="s2">and family and then I&#39;d go online and it</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.079" end="00:01:03.980" style="s2">was just so much less valuable we just</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.420" end="00:01:06.770" style="s2">wondered out loud about what a platform</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.980" end="00:01:08.720" style="s2">might look like if we try to replicate</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.770" end="00:01:10.220" style="s2">some of those more interesting</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.720" end="00:01:13.240" style="s2">conversations that we have around the</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.220" end="00:01:16.640" style="s2">dinner table or with friends and family</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.240" end="00:01:18.080" style="s2">space but it&#39;s not so easy when even the</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.640" end="00:01:20.480" style="s2">concept of free speech has been</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.080" end="00:01:22.670" style="s2">weaponized and in some places is</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.480" end="00:01:24.590" style="s2">considered a cover for reprehensible</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.670" end="00:01:25.850" style="s2">ideas so how do we have these</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.590" end="00:01:27.590" style="s2">conversations in an environment where</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.850" end="00:01:29.300" style="s2">the whole idea of it is starting to</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.590" end="00:01:32.690" style="s2">become suspicious I think the way that</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.300" end="00:01:35.270" style="s2">we can do this is by the people who</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.690" end="00:01:37.640" style="s2">aren&#39;t absolutely committed to defending</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.270" end="00:01:39.560" style="s2">their their own side and showing the</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.640" end="00:01:41.660" style="s2">problems on the others those who will</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.560" end="00:01:43.970" style="s2">concede that they have extremists of</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.660" end="00:01:46.250" style="s2">their own and who want to find common</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.970" end="00:01:48.890" style="s2">ground with people just over the bridge</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.250" end="00:01:50.870" style="s2">I think that is who is going to have the</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.890" end="00:01:52.790" style="s2">best kind of conversations and I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.870" end="00:01:54.350" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot more of them than we think</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.790" end="00:01:56.480" style="s2">there are and it&#39;s one thing to talk</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.350" end="00:01:58.160" style="s2">about how to have good faith positive</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.480" end="00:02:00.830" style="s2">conversations and to treat each other</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.160" end="00:02:03.410" style="s2">with respect how easy is it to actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.830" end="00:02:04.970" style="s2">do it I think everybody is capable of</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.410" end="00:02:06.560" style="s2">saying you should listen to other people</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.970" end="00:02:09.679" style="s2">and have polite conversations the</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.560" end="00:02:12.770" style="s2">difficult part is how to do that and it</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.679" end="00:02:13.939" style="s2">seems at least from my experience and</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.770" end="00:02:16.989" style="s2">from some of those that I&#39;ve talked to</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.939" end="00:02:19.160" style="s2">that he is about as bad at that as</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.989" end="00:02:21.380" style="s2">anybody I guess I should</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.160" end="00:02:23.630" style="s2">be some kind of an avatar for for the</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.380" end="00:02:25.160" style="s2">message of my book but again anybody who</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.630" end="00:02:28.070" style="s2">wants to deal with that it can reach out</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.160" end="00:02:33.919" style="s2">to me privately Twitter is a performance</p>

<p begin="00:03:11.990" end="00:03:17.030" style="s2">all been very recently and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.910" end="00:03:20.450" style="s2">a it&#39;s a kind of cultural toxin that we</p>

<p begin="00:03:25.820" end="00:03:30.410" style="s2">do that and it&#39;s taken hold and</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.040" end="00:03:33.470" style="s2">germinated in our culture and if we want</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.410" end="00:03:36.110" style="s2">to start making changes to that we have</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.470" end="00:03:38.150" style="s2">to change ourselves first so we have to</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.110" end="00:03:39.410" style="s2">be the ones willing to listen we have to</p>

<p begin="00:04:02.959" end="00:04:08.239" style="s2">are gonna be hurt once global sea la see</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.750" end="00:04:10.520" style="s2">you once the catastrophe startings but</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.239" end="00:04:12.020" style="s2">the larger point is that what we need to</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.520" end="00:04:13.760" style="s2">do is we need to speak openly and</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.020" end="00:04:15.770" style="s2">honestly about things and if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.760" end="00:04:17.840" style="s2">those problems the earth doesn&#39;t give a</p>

<p begin="00:04:17.840" end="00:04:22.610" style="s2">gonna solve themselves so those problems</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.510" end="00:04:24.590" style="s2">it might not be the solution that we</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.610" end="00:04:26.990" style="s2">want the root of this whole thing is</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.590" end="00:04:28.910" style="s2">conversation its discourse its dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.990" end="00:04:29.990" style="s2">it&#39;s listening it&#39;s understanding it</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.910" end="00:04:32.840" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s an ecological</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.990" end="00:04:34.790" style="s2">problem or any other problem that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.840" end="00:04:37.310" style="s2">first place that we have to start the</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.790" end="00:04:40.250" style="s2">most important thing is conversation</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.310" end="00:04:42.800" style="s2">listening and having having an ability</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.250" end="00:04:45.979" style="s2">to know how to have those conversations</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.800" end="00:04:46.850" style="s2">I&#39;ve read the book earlier on today and</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.979" end="00:04:48.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.850" end="00:04:50.280" style="s2">stuff in it</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.240" end="00:04:51.449" style="s2">you liked it yeah I really liked it I</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.280" end="00:04:52.979" style="s2">thought I think it&#39;s a really good book</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.449" end="00:04:57.120" style="s2">I think it&#39;s really sort of pithy</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.979" end="00:04:59.009" style="s2">concise and very clear I&#39;d like to pick</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.120" end="00:05:01.139" style="s2">up on a couple of things from near the</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.009" end="00:05:03.539" style="s2">beginning where you talked about the</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.139" end="00:05:05.009" style="s2">need for psychological safety and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.539" end="00:05:06.150" style="s2">something we&#39;ve talked a lot about on</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.009" end="00:05:08.130" style="s2">the channel this sort of need for</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.150" end="00:05:11.430" style="s2">psychological safety which is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.130" end="00:05:13.740" style="s2">paradoxical because a lot of your your</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.430" end="00:05:15.750" style="s2">targets with grievant studies and a lot</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.740" end="00:05:17.880" style="s2">of that your work you&#39;d assume that the</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.750" end="00:05:21.240" style="s2">idea of safe spaces is something that</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.880" end="00:05:23.389" style="s2">you that you would target and and would</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.240" end="00:05:26.220" style="s2">say is is overdone but actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.389" end="00:05:28.520" style="s2">psychological safety is is a safe space</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.220" end="00:05:31.770" style="s2">required for these kind of conversations</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.520" end="00:05:33.270" style="s2">yeah people the literature is very clear</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.770" end="00:05:35.030" style="s2">it&#39;s crystal clear people only change</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.270" end="00:05:37.500" style="s2">their views from a point of</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.030" end="00:05:38.940" style="s2">psychological safety the difference with</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.500" end="00:05:40.949" style="s2">grievance studies is that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.940" end="00:05:44.039" style="s2">one-on-one conversation with anybody</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.949" end="00:05:46.050" style="s2">that was again penetration testing like</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.039" end="00:05:49.970" style="s2">when you try to bring a bomb through</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.050" end="00:05:52.169" style="s2">airport security or white pack white hat</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.970" end="00:05:55.080" style="s2">hacking when you try to hack into a</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.169" end="00:05:57.360" style="s2">system we were testing systems we</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.080" end="00:05:59.219" style="s2">weren&#39;t testing individuals in those</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.360" end="00:06:01.020" style="s2">systems and how to have impossible</p>

<p begin="00:06:01.020" end="00:06:04.590" style="s2">converse with an institution or a system</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.180" end="00:06:06.570" style="s2">it&#39;s about how to converse with</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.590" end="00:06:08.969" style="s2">individuals within that institution and</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.570" end="00:06:11.789" style="s2">system and could you unpack that a</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.969" end="00:06:14.310" style="s2">little bit what what is a safe space in</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.789" end="00:06:17.150" style="s2">this invited psychological safety in</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.310" end="00:06:19.560" style="s2">this environment and how is it created</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.150" end="00:06:21.360" style="s2">psychological safety the key point is</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.560" end="00:06:23.580" style="s2">that you don&#39;t invoke a defensive</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.360" end="00:06:26.849" style="s2">posture and somebody else so the moment</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.580" end="00:06:30.120" style="s2">somebody feels defensive the likelihood</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.849" end="00:06:31.979" style="s2">of belief revision plummets I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.120" end="00:06:33.630" style="s2">necessarily saying that has to be a goal</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.979" end="00:06:36.750" style="s2">to have a conversation with belief</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.630" end="00:06:38.639" style="s2">revision but one of my goals in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.750" end="00:06:40.469" style="s2">Ghoulia&#39;s Plato says that it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.639" end="00:06:42.780" style="s2">better to be refuted than it is to</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.469" end="00:06:44.190" style="s2">refute and the idea there is if you can</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.780" end="00:06:46.650" style="s2">have that conversation and revise your</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.190" end="00:06:48.780" style="s2">own beliefs that&#39;s the pinnacle that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.650" end="00:06:51.690" style="s2">the goal that&#39;s the highest so there are</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.780" end="00:06:54.360" style="s2">multiple types of conversations there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.690" end="00:06:56.400" style="s2">conversations that deal with truth this</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.360" end="00:06:58.889" style="s2">is the basic binary and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.400" end="00:07:00.990" style="s2">conversations in which one engages to</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.889" end="00:07:02.380" style="s2">revise somebody&#39;s belief or perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.990" end="00:07:04.980" style="s2">their own belief</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.380" end="00:07:06.760" style="s2">even on both of those conditions</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.980" end="00:07:09.820" style="s2">psychological safety is paramount</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.760" end="00:07:11.650" style="s2">because that&#39;s when people&#39;s defensive</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.820" end="00:07:13.240" style="s2">postures go down when they when they</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.650" end="00:07:13.780" style="s2">invent when they evoke a defensive</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.240" end="00:07:15.880" style="s2">posture</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.780" end="00:07:17.320" style="s2">they won&#39;t revise their beliefs it</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.880" end="00:07:19.390" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that if they don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.320" end="00:07:21.490" style="s2">defensive posture they will it just</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.390" end="00:07:22.960" style="s2">means that it&#39;s a probability continuum</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.490" end="00:07:24.070" style="s2">it just means they&#39;re more likely to do</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.960" end="00:07:27.430" style="s2">that mmm</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.070" end="00:07:29.560" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know if I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.430" end="00:07:31.690" style="s2">you&#39;re familiar with the idea of like</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.560" end="00:07:34.810" style="s2">polyvagal theory yes</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.690" end="00:07:36.670" style="s2">I watched her episode yeah yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.810" end="00:07:38.650" style="s2">something that we&#39;ve been we did a whole</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.670" end="00:07:41.320" style="s2">piece around the science and psychology</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.650" end="00:07:42.940" style="s2">of I think we called it the science and</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.320" end="00:07:44.290" style="s2">psychology of polarization but you could</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.940" end="00:07:45.970" style="s2">also have called it the science and</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.290" end="00:07:49.060" style="s2">psychology of difficult conversations</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.970" end="00:07:51.580" style="s2">and it&#39;s I was struck reading your book</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.060" end="00:07:52.750" style="s2">how how much what you&#39;d written mirrored</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.580" end="00:07:54.960" style="s2">what we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.750" end="00:07:59.020" style="s2">especially the value of curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.960" end="00:08:01.420" style="s2">because it from the from polyvagal</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.020" end="00:08:04.030" style="s2">theory curiosity and defensiveness</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.420" end="00:08:05.380" style="s2">cannot coexist if you&#39;re curious you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.030" end="00:08:07.360" style="s2">not defense and if you&#39;re defensive</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.380" end="00:08:08.920" style="s2">you&#39;re not curious and you mentioned you</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.360" end="00:08:13.210" style="s2">use the word curious quite a lot in your</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.920" end="00:08:15.610" style="s2">book yeah and there&#39;s a ancient</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.210" end="00:08:17.530" style="s2">philosophical adage wisdom begins in</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.610" end="00:08:20.740" style="s2">wonder so when people start wondering</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.530" end="00:08:22.960" style="s2">about things and I just I just want say</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.740" end="00:08:24.940" style="s2">I think that&#39;s the tragedy of our age</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.960" end="00:08:26.530" style="s2">right now is that people don&#39;t wonder</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.940" end="00:08:28.720" style="s2">they don&#39;t wonder aloud they certainly</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.530" end="00:08:30.430" style="s2">don&#39;t wonder on social media I had a lot</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.720" end="00:08:31.780" style="s2">of thoughts that I&#39;d like to just tweet</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.430" end="00:08:35.620" style="s2">out and put on social media because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.780" end="00:08:37.599" style="s2">wondering but then I&#39;d get another word</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.620" end="00:08:42.250" style="s2">I was I don&#39;t know the word to use</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.599" end="00:08:43.990" style="s2">beside gang bang but don&#39;t piled dogpile</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.250" end="00:08:47.710" style="s2">would be a better word yeah I would be</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.990" end="00:08:49.720" style="s2">dog piled by people moron grifter idiot</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.710" end="00:08:51.940" style="s2">should have known that and do I really</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.720" end="00:08:53.800" style="s2">want to look through 50 examples of</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.940" end="00:08:56.080" style="s2">people calling me a moron an idiot and a</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.800" end="00:08:57.640" style="s2">grifter in a Nazi because I was curious</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.080" end="00:09:00.910" style="s2">about something and I wanted somebody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.640" end="00:09:02.590" style="s2">feedback so one of the things we do</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.910" end="00:09:04.720" style="s2">we&#39;ve done in our current culture is</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.590" end="00:09:06.940" style="s2">that we&#39;ve robbed ourselves of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.720" end="00:09:08.620" style="s2">ability to wonder and particularly we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.940" end="00:09:11.860" style="s2">robbed ourselves of the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.620" end="00:09:13.730" style="s2">wonder out loud and wonder out loud in</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.860" end="00:09:17.779" style="s2">an academic environment</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.730" end="00:09:19.369" style="s2">so we don&#39;t weed we actively discourage</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.779" end="00:09:21.139" style="s2">wandering and when people think that</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.369" end="00:09:23.119" style="s2">they have the answers to questions they</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.139" end="00:09:24.769" style="s2">don&#39;t wonder anymore why would you</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.119" end="00:09:26.269" style="s2">wonder if you thought you had the answer</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.769" end="00:09:27.919" style="s2">to a question there&#39;s nothing to wonder</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.269" end="00:09:29.449" style="s2">about can you tell me a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.919" end="00:09:32.660" style="s2">the competition that you&#39;re running on</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.449" end="00:09:34.309" style="s2">what you hope to achieve through it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.660" end="00:09:37.129" style="s2">so impossible conversations was</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.309" end="00:09:39.709" style="s2">initially brought to us through Peter</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.129" end="00:09:42.079" style="s2">Boghossian and James Lindsay&#39;s book idea</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.709" end="00:09:44.179" style="s2">we talked to Pete and Jim were friends</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.079" end="00:09:45.709" style="s2">of theirs and and it just seemed as</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.179" end="00:09:47.149" style="s2">though there was a real strong alignment</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.709" end="00:09:48.859" style="s2">between what they were trying to achieve</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.149" end="00:09:50.779" style="s2">with the book and what letter is trying</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.859" end="00:09:52.819" style="s2">to achieve so we lost the competition</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.779" end="00:09:55.639" style="s2">with the view to bring people together</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.819" end="00:09:58.910" style="s2">from different parts of the ideological</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.639" end="00:10:00.859" style="s2">spectrum to have long form thoughtful</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.910" end="00:10:03.350" style="s2">meaningful good-faith conversations</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.859" end="00:10:06.709" style="s2">across the divide the judging panel</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.350" end="00:10:08.959" style="s2">consists of some relatively big names in</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.709" end="00:10:11.059" style="s2">the public intellectual space and</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.959" end="00:10:12.350" style="s2">they&#39;ll be assessing the conversations</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.059" end="00:10:14.269" style="s2">as they come in and selecting someone</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.350" end="00:10:17.899" style="s2">else in addition to the prize pool that</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.269" end="00:10:19.939" style="s2">the winning conversation astray and</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.899" end="00:10:22.669" style="s2">they&#39;ll also appear on a number of</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.939" end="00:10:24.139" style="s2">podcasts and be publicized on area</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.669" end="00:10:26.179" style="s2">magazine so we&#39;re pretty excited about</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.139" end="00:10:31.160" style="s2">the next couple months the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.179" end="00:10:32.509" style="s2">run between now and just to get a sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.160" end="00:10:34.429" style="s2">have you said that a lot of your best</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.509" end="00:10:36.169" style="s2">conversations around the dinner table</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.429" end="00:10:38.329" style="s2">what were those topics of conversation</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.169" end="00:10:39.679" style="s2">what were you guys talking about that</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.329" end="00:10:43.129" style="s2">you felt were not being replicated</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.679" end="00:10:45.139" style="s2">online I suppose it wasn&#39;t that the</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.129" end="00:10:46.970" style="s2">topics weren&#39;t being replicated it was</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.139" end="00:10:48.289" style="s2">more the style of the conversation I</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.970" end="00:10:51.049" style="s2">think one of the things that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.289" end="00:10:55.369" style="s2">realized particularly as we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.049" end="00:10:58.660" style="s2">building letters is that do a style of</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.369" end="00:11:02.499" style="s2">communication amongst our family is</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.660" end="00:11:04.730" style="s2">quite unique aggressive yeah yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.499" end="00:11:06.980" style="s2">think it may be it&#39;s part of this</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.730" end="00:11:10.069" style="s2">African culture but I guess the goal is</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.980" end="00:11:14.029" style="s2">to put a proposition on the table and</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.069" end="00:11:17.389" style="s2">then have everyone else destroy it and</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.029" end="00:11:21.379" style="s2">then your confidence and it was always</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.389" end="00:11:23.480" style="s2">seen as a non personal impersonal thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.379" end="00:11:27.060" style="s2">where it was what matters here is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.480" end="00:11:32.680" style="s2">true regardless of</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.060" end="00:11:33.880" style="s2">the I guess the the intention so what</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.680" end="00:11:36.190" style="s2">people were trying to do around the</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.880" end="00:11:37.570" style="s2">dinner table was actually establish why</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.190" end="00:11:40.660" style="s2">it is that something&#39;s true or why it</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.570" end="00:11:43.030" style="s2">isn&#39;t true and but Dunham is so in a</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.660" end="00:11:46.180" style="s2">good faith way and I think that elements</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.030" end="00:11:48.250" style="s2">a good faith is fundamental to the best</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.180" end="00:11:51.340" style="s2">quality and conversations it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.250" end="00:11:53.290" style="s2">matter how much two people disagree but</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.340" end="00:11:54.690" style="s2">if they come to the table respecting one</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.290" end="00:11:58.540" style="s2">another</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.690" end="00:12:00.400" style="s2">playing by I guess a rules of engagement</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.540" end="00:12:02.010" style="s2">that include being openly changing your</p>

<p begin="00:12:02.010" end="00:12:07.840" style="s2">being genuinely curious about the</p>

<p begin="00:12:08.890" end="00:12:14.020" style="s2">experienced growing up and to don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.790" end="00:12:16.240" style="s2">don&#39;t see that very often I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.020" end="00:12:18.910" style="s2">believe on the internet it&#39;s it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.240" end="00:12:20.890" style="s2">tribal and combative and it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.910" end="00:12:25.050" style="s2">create echo chambers yeah I&#39;ve actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.890" end="00:12:27.760" style="s2">noticed in speaking to other people that</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.050" end="00:12:31.960" style="s2">we can be quite abrasive or at least</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.760" end="00:12:33.580" style="s2">apparently so to others because we we</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.960" end="00:12:37.090" style="s2">play a different game and conversation I</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.580" end="00:12:39.760" style="s2">think then then most other people where</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.090" end="00:12:43.210" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of merciless in that you</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.760" end="00:12:45.310" style="s2">you can attack the person as hard as you</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.210" end="00:12:49.720" style="s2">like but it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s attacking ideas</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.310" end="00:12:52.420" style="s2">and most people my experience outside of</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.720" end="00:12:55.660" style="s2">our small you know cult of family and</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.420" end="00:12:57.520" style="s2">friends you know they take that as an</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.660" end="00:12:59.230" style="s2">attack on them and that&#39;s never been</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.520" end="00:13:01.240" style="s2">it&#39;s always been about discovering</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.230" end="00:13:02.830" style="s2">what&#39;s true so you know as Claude said</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.240" end="00:13:05.110" style="s2">it&#39;s not that we were engaging in a</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.830" end="00:13:07.630" style="s2">specific topic it&#39;s that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.110" end="00:13:10.350" style="s2">curiosity amongst us in our friends</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.630" end="00:13:14.440" style="s2">about figuring out what&#39;s true and</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.350" end="00:13:17.340" style="s2">realizing that we&#39;re all you know pretty</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.440" end="00:13:21.670" style="s2">ignorant on virtually every topic and</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.340" end="00:13:24.250" style="s2">and using one another to to get closer</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.670" end="00:13:27.220" style="s2">to the truth yeah it kind of reminds me</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.250" end="00:13:29.260" style="s2">I&#39;ve heard Eric and Brett Weinstein talk</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.220" end="00:13:32.140" style="s2">about how it was for them growing up and</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.260" end="00:13:33.970" style="s2">how they used to they used to have</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.140" end="00:13:37.800" style="s2">certain rules or certain formulations</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.970" end="00:13:40.360" style="s2">that are very similar to that about</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.800" end="00:13:40.579" style="s2">interrogating people&#39;s perspectives and</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.360" end="00:13:42.790" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.579" end="00:13:45.679" style="s2">arrogating our own perspectives like</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.790" end="00:13:46.790" style="s2">almost yeah really ruthlessly I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.679" end="00:13:48.110" style="s2">know if you&#39;ve heard them talking about</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.790" end="00:13:51.110" style="s2">that before and wonder if there&#39;s any</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.110" end="00:13:53.600" style="s2">similarities I haven&#39;t but we&#39;ll take</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.110" end="00:13:55.569" style="s2">any similarities that comparison to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.600" end="00:13:58.160" style="s2">the Weinstein brothers if you forget</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.569" end="00:13:59.089" style="s2">cool I don&#39;t think either of you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.160" end="00:14:02.299" style="s2">the hair for it</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.089" end="00:14:03.980" style="s2">give us some good time I mean the main</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.299" end="00:14:06.079" style="s2">reason that we&#39;re sitting down or that</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.980" end="00:14:08.559" style="s2">the particular thing that&#39;s happening at</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.079" end="00:14:11.660" style="s2">the moment is this competition on letter</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.559" end="00:14:14.059" style="s2">which is about impossible conversations</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.660" end="00:14:16.429" style="s2">which also coincides with the book by</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.059" end="00:14:16.970" style="s2">Peter Bogosian and James Lindsay who I</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.429" end="00:14:18.230" style="s2">know you</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.970" end="00:14:21.170" style="s2">so you&#39;re one of the judges on the</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.230" end="00:14:23.360" style="s2">letter competition and also you&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.170" end="00:14:26.420" style="s2">you were working with James and Peter on</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.360" end="00:14:28.819" style="s2">the grievant studies piece I just love</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.420" end="00:14:31.309" style="s2">you to to talk a little bit about that</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.819" end="00:14:33.470" style="s2">background and what you think what</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.309" end="00:14:37.459" style="s2">you&#39;re hoping to get from this the the</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.470" end="00:14:40.249" style="s2">competition on letter well our our</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.459" end="00:14:42.799" style="s2">project it was of course about shoving a</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.249" end="00:14:44.660" style="s2">problem that we saw to be happening in</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.799" end="00:14:46.970" style="s2">the academic lift and I love that does</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.660" end="00:14:48.199" style="s2">come down to not being able to talk</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.970" end="00:14:52.129" style="s2">about it straightforwardly</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.199" end="00:14:54.439" style="s2">so we had been we we came from this New</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.129" end="00:14:56.540" style="s2">Atheists background so we were</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.439" end="00:14:59.419" style="s2">criticizing and liberal ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.540" end="00:15:00.919" style="s2">unsubstantiated truth claims but mostly</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.419" end="00:15:02.269" style="s2">from religion and mostly because of</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.919" end="00:15:06.129" style="s2">where we are geographically from</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.269" end="00:15:09.619" style="s2">Christianity but when this rise of</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.129" end="00:15:12.230" style="s2">postmodern ideas in the form of social</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.619" end="00:15:16.879" style="s2">justice scholarship and activism really</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.230" end="00:15:18.290" style="s2">started escalating around 2015 it became</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.879" end="00:15:20.389" style="s2">harder and harder for us to avoid this</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.290" end="00:15:22.730" style="s2">so we have been addressing that&#39;s we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.389" end="00:15:24.410" style="s2">written a lot of essays saying what we</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.730" end="00:15:27.739" style="s2">thought the problems were a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.410" end="00:15:29.269" style="s2">people responded that we were not</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.739" end="00:15:31.399" style="s2">picking that there wasn&#39;t an in depth</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.269" end="00:15:34.399" style="s2">problem that had always some crazy</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.399" end="00:15:36.589" style="s2">papers so yeah we decided to go into it</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.399" end="00:15:37.970" style="s2">spend a year within the system really</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.589" end="00:15:40.579" style="s2">work out how it worked</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.970" end="00:15:41.869" style="s2">get some things published for if nothing</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.579" end="00:15:43.429" style="s2">else people would then not be able to</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.869" end="00:15:46.509" style="s2">say you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.429" end="00:15:50.569" style="s2">about and that that was how that project</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.509" end="00:15:51.889" style="s2">came about but as it comes up for for</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.569" end="00:15:54.769" style="s2">having those difficult conversations</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.889" end="00:15:56.480" style="s2">a recap people who might not know so</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.769" end="00:15:58.189" style="s2">then you you managed to get I think was</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.480" end="00:16:01.579" style="s2">it seven pieces published in different</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.189" end="00:16:06.199" style="s2">journals yet in a product we we wrote 20</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.579" end="00:16:09.410" style="s2">papers which were either really</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.199" end="00:16:11.629" style="s2">methodologically awful or absurd or</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.410" end="00:16:14.470" style="s2">unethical and it is they sort of made</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.629" end="00:16:16.489" style="s2">claims that weren&#39;t warranted by what we</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.470" end="00:16:19.579" style="s2">were showing so that they were</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.489" end="00:16:23.029" style="s2">theoretical interpretations we had seven</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.579" end="00:16:26.119" style="s2">of them accepted six of them we retired</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.029" end="00:16:29.720" style="s2">but seven of them were still in play and</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.119" end="00:16:32.029" style="s2">we had great hopes of five of those but</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.720" end="00:16:35.410" style="s2">we had to stop because we got found not</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.029" end="00:16:37.999" style="s2">by other journals but by journalists so</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.410" end="00:16:41.629" style="s2">that that was our project had we been</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.999" end="00:16:43.879" style="s2">able to continue for another sort of six</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.629" end="00:16:47.749" style="s2">months or so I think yet we would have</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.879" end="00:16:50.660" style="s2">got 10 12 even 15 in we were out their</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.749" end="00:16:53.899" style="s2">success rate was increasing to near a</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.660" end="00:16:56.569" style="s2">hundred so it was it is really very easy</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.899" end="00:16:58.069" style="s2">to churn out this stuff if you just make</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.569" end="00:17:02.600" style="s2">the right claims and quote the right</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.069" end="00:17:05.600" style="s2">people and that isn&#39;t scholarship and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.600" end="00:17:08.269" style="s2">yeah just to talk about the impossible</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.600" end="00:17:09.470" style="s2">conversations on on letter what are your</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.269" end="00:17:11.899" style="s2">hopes for the platform what do you hope</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.470" end="00:17:14.029" style="s2">for the competition I&#39;m a big fan of</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.899" end="00:17:16.010" style="s2">letter because I think it has got the</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.029" end="00:17:18.350" style="s2">ability to get people talking to each</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.010" end="00:17:21.019" style="s2">other as human beings which doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.350" end="00:17:22.750" style="s2">really happen when you&#39;re on Twitter or</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.019" end="00:17:25.309" style="s2">something like that being you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.750" end="00:17:27.769" style="s2">you&#39;ve got people just sort of sniping</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.309" end="00:17:29.809" style="s2">at you from all angles and it&#39;s so such</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.769" end="00:17:31.340" style="s2">a short space it really is just good for</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.809" end="00:17:34.880" style="s2">sort of throwing daggers at each other</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.340" end="00:17:36.409" style="s2">but if you get people willing to have an</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.880" end="00:17:37.880" style="s2">in-depth thoughtful conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.409" end="00:17:39.799" style="s2">they&#39;re writing back and forth in their</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.880" end="00:17:41.090" style="s2">own time they can consider what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.799" end="00:17:43.549" style="s2">saying they can consider what the other</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.090" end="00:17:44.870" style="s2">person is saying then it&#39;s much more</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.549" end="00:17:47.269" style="s2">like you&#39;re speaking to another human</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.870" end="00:17:49.669" style="s2">it&#39;s much more like you have a</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.269" end="00:17:51.860" style="s2">responsibility to be thoughtful and I</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.669" end="00:17:54.440" style="s2">think good things can result from that I</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.860" end="00:17:56.480" style="s2">feel like the book is very timely</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.440" end="00:17:59.389" style="s2">because there&#39;s a lot of focus now on</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.480" end="00:18:01.610" style="s2">why conversations break down and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.389" end="00:18:04.070" style="s2">sense that we can&#39;t really move forward</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.610" end="00:18:05.670" style="s2">until we start from this kind of almost</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.070" end="00:18:07.410" style="s2">like the foundations of n</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.670" end="00:18:10.020" style="s2">kind of solution to many of the problems</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.410" end="00:18:12.990" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing involve having these</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.020" end="00:18:15.210" style="s2">generative conversations so I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.990" end="00:18:16.770" style="s2">ask you first why do you think do you</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.210" end="00:18:19.290" style="s2">agree that it&#39;s very timely and why do</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.770" end="00:18:22.050" style="s2">you think it&#39;s really timely yeah I do</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.290" end="00:18:25.290" style="s2">actually I think it it tapped right into</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.050" end="00:18:28.740" style="s2">a vein of what&#39;s going on by some luck</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.290" end="00:18:30.600" style="s2">because I feel like it was very timely</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.740" end="00:18:32.700" style="s2">when we wrote it and then a period went</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.600" end="00:18:33.840" style="s2">by where it would have been less and now</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.700" end="00:18:35.580" style="s2">there seems to be something of a</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.840" end="00:18:37.470" style="s2">renaissance of people wanting to reach</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.580" end="00:18:39.840" style="s2">across aisles and talk to people and</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.470" end="00:18:41.630" style="s2">understand one another better try to</p>

<p begin="00:18:41.630" end="00:18:49.290" style="s2">so I do think that the book is timely</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.700" end="00:18:51.540" style="s2">because it&#39;s geared toward the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.290" end="00:18:55.020" style="s2">having conversations with people with</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.540" end="00:18:56.970" style="s2">whom you don&#39;t agree and I think kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.020" end="00:18:59.040" style="s2">the cultural moment we find ourselves in</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.970" end="00:19:00.420" style="s2">is one in which there&#39;s been a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.040" end="00:19:02.370" style="s2">polarization of course I&#39;m speaking</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.420" end="00:19:05.040" style="s2">primarily in the u.s. context I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.370" end="00:19:06.330" style="s2">know quite how bad it is anywhere else</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.040" end="00:19:09.780" style="s2">but in the United States obviously</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.330" end="00:19:11.790" style="s2">there&#39;s very little social or political</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.780" end="00:19:14.340" style="s2">capital to be had by crossing the</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.790" end="00:19:16.530" style="s2">political aisle if you&#39;re on the left</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.340" end="00:19:18.420" style="s2">you have to spend time with people on</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.530" end="00:19:20.130" style="s2">the left and only criticize people on</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.420" end="00:19:21.450" style="s2">the right if you do talk to somebody on</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.130" end="00:19:25.460" style="s2">the right you have to stick their feet</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.450" end="00:19:29.460" style="s2">to the fire and everything else and vice</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.460" end="00:19:31.140" style="s2">versa the same thing you know I hear</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.460" end="00:19:33.990" style="s2">people I live in the southeastern United</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.140" end="00:19:35.820" style="s2">States which is very conservative and I</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.990" end="00:19:38.250" style="s2">hear people you know blaming the</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.820" end="00:19:41.430" style="s2">Liberals and liberals for everything in</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.250" end="00:19:46.620" style="s2">the left the left bubble and it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.430" end="00:19:47.970" style="s2">as very divisive I mean social identity</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.620" end="00:19:49.560" style="s2">theory gone mad</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.970" end="00:19:51.060" style="s2">kind of environment in which people</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.560" end="00:19:54.900" style="s2">aren&#39;t speaking to people who have</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.060" end="00:19:56.490" style="s2">different views very much and so oh this</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.900" end="00:19:58.830" style="s2">has gone on for long enough where I feel</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.490" end="00:20:01.860" style="s2">like there&#39;s this real hunger from</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.830" end="00:20:03.480" style="s2">people who are tired of all of the the</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.860" end="00:20:05.310" style="s2">so-called politically exhausted people</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.480" end="00:20:07.560" style="s2">who are tired of all of this division</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.310" end="00:20:10.200" style="s2">and fighting to be able to just start</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.560" end="00:20:13.530" style="s2">being friends again that understand what</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.200" end="00:20:15.960" style="s2">people think and say and where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.530" end="00:20:17.550" style="s2">coming from well most importantly to</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.960" end="00:20:19.140" style="s2">start generating relationships and</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.550" end="00:20:21.210" style="s2">communities again where every</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.140" end="00:20:23.250" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have to be a political battle to</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.210" end="00:20:25.590" style="s2">the death and just you know people</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.250" end="00:20:27.480" style="s2">unfriending each other and bailing out</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.590" end="00:20:29.160" style="s2">and I think there&#39;s just this moment now</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.480" end="00:20:32.040" style="s2">where people are hungry to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.160" end="00:20:33.480" style="s2">know how to talk to people again there</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.040" end="00:20:35.250" style="s2">is a sense that there are new sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.480" end="00:20:38.250" style="s2">political dividing lines and certainly</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.250" end="00:20:40.740" style="s2">the issue of social justice has become</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.250" end="00:20:42.390" style="s2">one of those kind of real sort of fault</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.740" end="00:20:45.600" style="s2">lines probably more and more over the</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.390" end="00:20:47.130" style="s2">last few years and I guess from loop</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.600" end="00:20:48.480" style="s2">from the grievant studies papers that</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.130" end="00:20:50.930" style="s2">you&#39;ve put out you will be seen as</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.480" end="00:20:54.360" style="s2">falling definitely on one side of those</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.930" end="00:20:56.940" style="s2">battle line and I&#39;d love to hear your</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.360" end="00:20:57.720" style="s2">your your thoughts on that and do you</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.940" end="00:21:03.780" style="s2">think there&#39;s a new political</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.720" end="00:21:05.640" style="s2">configuration going on yeah and no it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.780" end="00:21:08.540" style="s2">complicated I don&#39;t think that the that</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.640" end="00:21:10.860" style="s2">the liberal or I guess left and right</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.540" end="00:21:13.620" style="s2">dichotomy has actually broken down I</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.860" end="00:21:15.810" style="s2">think it&#39;s kind of been it&#39;s starting to</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.620" end="00:21:17.310" style="s2">be suspended but I believe it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.810" end="00:21:19.890" style="s2">a temporary arrangement</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.310" end="00:21:23.250" style="s2">I don&#39;t think that the the battle</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.890" end="00:21:26.300" style="s2">between kind of a progressive liberal</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.250" end="00:21:28.770" style="s2">open idea of society versus like</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.300" end="00:21:30.660" style="s2">conservative one is I mean it&#39;s just too</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.770" end="00:21:32.070" style="s2">fundamentally it&#39;s the it&#39;s the gas</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.660" end="00:21:33.870" style="s2">pedal and the brake pedal it&#39;s of</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.070" end="00:21:36.810" style="s2">society and you&#39;re gonna have people who</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.870" end="00:21:38.430" style="s2">fall on each side of that there is</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.810" end="00:21:40.470" style="s2">certainly I feel like what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.430" end="00:21:42.780" style="s2">actually run into is a situation where</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.470" end="00:21:44.640" style="s2">you have politics is usual on one level</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.780" end="00:21:49.320" style="s2">and then there&#39;s like this meta</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.640" end="00:21:50.940" style="s2">political issue where you have forces</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.320" end="00:21:54.150" style="s2">both on the far right and on the far</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.940" end="00:21:57.450" style="s2">left that are kind of against the</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.150" end="00:21:58.800" style="s2">overarching liberal project in their own</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.450" end="00:22:00.150" style="s2">ways it&#39;s really that they&#39;re doing the</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.800" end="00:22:05.640" style="s2">same thing but pointed in opposite</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.150" end="00:22:08.070" style="s2">directions and because the kind of meta</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.640" end="00:22:10.290" style="s2">political issue has to be settled before</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.070" end="00:22:13.500" style="s2">we can get back to politics ugly as it</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.290" end="00:22:15.990" style="s2">is as usual there&#39;s an old there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.500" end="00:22:18.660" style="s2">agreement that&#39;s kind of taking place to</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.990" end="00:22:21.120" style="s2">set aside the small battle in order to</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.660" end="00:22:22.920" style="s2">fight the bigger battle so I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.120" end="00:22:24.630" style="s2">there&#39;s quite a realignment going on</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.920" end="00:22:25.830" style="s2">like a lot of people are suggesting I</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.630" end="00:22:28.530" style="s2">think it&#39;s slightly more complicated</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.830" end="00:22:31.470" style="s2">than that it&#39;s more like a temporary</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.530" end="00:22:32.260" style="s2">truce the way I&#39;ve characterized it in</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.470" end="00:22:36.490" style="s2">the past by</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.260" end="00:22:39.190" style="s2">metaphor is you can imagine you know on</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.490" end="00:22:41.200" style="s2">a football pitch you&#39;ve got you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.190" end="00:22:44.170" style="s2">two teams maybe the red team in the blue</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.200" end="00:22:47.110" style="s2">team and obviously they&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.170" end="00:22:49.480" style="s2">metaphorical war with one another in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.110" end="00:22:51.310" style="s2">game and right now there are people</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.480" end="00:22:53.260" style="s2">coming in from the outside whether they</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.310" end="00:22:53.950" style="s2">represent one side or the other or some</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.260" end="00:22:56.080" style="s2">of both</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.950" end="00:22:57.730" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter who are essentially</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.080" end="00:23:00.280" style="s2">telling them no no this game won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.730" end="00:23:01.930" style="s2">played anymore and the red team and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.280" end="00:23:03.580" style="s2">blue team are like screw you are all</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.930" end="00:23:05.440" style="s2">footballers and we&#39;re gonna play the</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.580" end="00:23:06.700" style="s2">game and we&#39;ll go back to being against</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.440" end="00:23:09.240" style="s2">each other when we can play the game</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.700" end="00:23:12.790" style="s2">again and so I feel like that&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.240" end="00:23:14.440" style="s2">the mood of the moment is that the peter</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.790" end="00:23:16.020" style="s2">has Freddy&#39;s it that the aliens have</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.440" end="00:23:18.550" style="s2">come down and you put your own political</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.020" end="00:23:20.680" style="s2">squabbles aside to deal with the aliens</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.550" end="00:23:22.690" style="s2">when the aliens have come down and I</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.680" end="00:23:27.010" style="s2">think that that&#39;s actually not a bad way</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.690" end="00:23:28.510" style="s2">to look at it and I mean what I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.010" end="00:23:30.280" style="s2">interested in I want to explore in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.510" end="00:23:32.230" style="s2">piece that I&#39;m doing at the moment about</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.280" end="00:23:35.080" style="s2">letter and about the kind of the broader</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.230" end="00:23:37.630" style="s2">topic of impossible conversations is it</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.080" end="00:23:40.480" style="s2">feels like whatever the dividing lines</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.630" end="00:23:43.410" style="s2">are now in society it&#39;s very easy for</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.480" end="00:23:46.540" style="s2">that even that requests for</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.410" end="00:23:49.690" style="s2">conversations across the divide to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.540" end="00:23:51.670" style="s2">itself like for some people it&#39;s seen as</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.690" end="00:23:53.170" style="s2">suspicious it&#39;s seen as you saw what</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.670" end="00:23:54.850" style="s2">happened to the idea of the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.170" end="00:23:56.890" style="s2">dark web it was almost immediately seen</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.850" end="00:24:00.100" style="s2">as a sort of Trojan horse for</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.890" end="00:24:01.570" style="s2">reprehensible ideas so even the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.100" end="00:24:04.900" style="s2">free speech and even the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.570" end="00:24:10.330" style="s2">dialogue itself is now in certain areas</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.900" end="00:24:11.920" style="s2">considered part of is considered</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.330" end="00:24:13.180" style="s2">suspicious so how do we have these</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.920" end="00:24:14.890" style="s2">conversations in an environment where</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.180" end="00:24:18.610" style="s2">the whole idea of it is starting to</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.890" end="00:24:20.790" style="s2">become suspicious I think this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.610" end="00:24:23.440" style="s2">breaks down into a lot of different</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.790" end="00:24:25.570" style="s2">things I think what people are doing</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.440" end="00:24:29.200" style="s2">when what they&#39;re reacting against is</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.570" end="00:24:30.730" style="s2">the extremes on the other side so if yet</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.200" end="00:24:33.160" style="s2">we can see that&#39;s something like the</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.730" end="00:24:35.590" style="s2">intellectual dark web or even sort of</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.160" end="00:24:37.480" style="s2">centrism or liberalism some of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.590" end="00:24:41.260" style="s2">identitarian leftist can see this as</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.480" end="00:24:43.990" style="s2">part of a far-right may be a gateway</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.260" end="00:24:46.150" style="s2">carrying water for a you know a drug</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.990" end="00:24:48.400" style="s2">- what all of this this kind of nonsense</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.150" end="00:24:51.430" style="s2">so we&#39;ve got to try and break those down</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.400" end="00:24:54.450" style="s2">yeah but I think the way that we can do</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.430" end="00:24:56.800" style="s2">this is by the people who aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.450" end="00:24:59.140" style="s2">absolutely committed to defending their</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.800" end="00:25:01.510" style="s2">their own side and showing the problems</p>

<p begin="00:25:56.980" end="00:26:02.530" style="s2">talk to a libertarian I could talk to a</p>

<p begin="00:26:55.270" end="00:27:00.670" style="s2">think as well that we&#39;re in a situation</p>

<p begin="00:27:05.170" end="00:27:10.030" style="s2">charged it is much more about finding a</p>

<p begin="00:27:17.650" end="00:27:21.670" style="s2">straight on that opportunity as a chance</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.380" end="00:27:23.920" style="s2">to strike a blow and that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.670" end="00:27:26.080" style="s2">conversations are happening so or also</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.920" end="00:27:28.210" style="s2">to signal to your own tribe that your</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.080" end="00:27:29.980" style="s2">yeah that it&#39;s more about signaling to</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.210" end="00:27:31.510" style="s2">your own tribe than it is trying to</p>

<p begin="00:27:40.900" end="00:27:47.429" style="s2">think can legitimately be called bad</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.630" end="00:27:51.010" style="s2">faith so I think we need to try to</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.429" end="00:27:53.760" style="s2">restore if we ever had it I think we did</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.010" end="00:27:55.630" style="s2">an expectation of charity of</p>

<p begin="00:28:10.390" end="00:28:13.450" style="s2">or not and it&#39;s your prejudice that no</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.250" end="00:28:15.670" style="s2">one can actually believe what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.450" end="00:28:17.290" style="s2">saying genuinely then they have to think</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.670" end="00:28:20.260" style="s2">about whether they themselves are acting</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.290" end="00:28:22.240" style="s2">in bad faith and you mentioned steel</p>

<p begin="00:28:41.320" end="00:28:46.830" style="s2">science had the answer to everything</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.880" end="00:28:49.240" style="s2">and so post-modernism wanted to</p>

<p begin="00:31:46.390" end="00:31:52.240" style="s2">because it seems a very complex picture</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.510" end="00:31:55.780" style="s2">right now oh that&#39;s easy I would ask</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.240" end="00:31:58.630" style="s2">them why they believe that I know that</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.780" end="00:32:00.720" style="s2">sounds silly but and then I would truly</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.630" end="00:32:05.260" style="s2">listen to what they had to say</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.720" end="00:32:06.760" style="s2">yeah now keep in mind that sounds simple</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.260" end="00:32:08.230" style="s2">and it is but there are some people</p>

<p begin="00:33:29.600" end="00:33:33.440" style="s2">realization of two things</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.040" end="00:33:36.260" style="s2">one there are some people with whom</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.440" end="00:33:38.840" style="s2">conversation is simply impossible it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.260" end="00:33:40.220" style="s2">somebody Darrell Davis invited an T for</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.840" end="00:33:43.700" style="s2">folks to have a conversation with him</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.220" end="00:33:45.470" style="s2">they refused that&#39;s the first thing the</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.700" end="00:33:49.040" style="s2">second thing is if we really want to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.470" end="00:33:51.170" style="s2">effective in conversations and having</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.040" end="00:33:54.710" style="s2">conversations ideally what would have to</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.170" end="00:33:56.330" style="s2">change is the bedrock of the value so</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.710" end="00:33:58.670" style="s2">the older I get the more I realized that</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.330" end="00:34:00.860" style="s2">this is all about values and so if we</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.670" end="00:34:04.250" style="s2">can help people value free exchange</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.860" end="00:34:06.500" style="s2">open ideas communication but the way to</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.250" end="00:34:09.590" style="s2">do that is to start with listening</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.500" end="00:34:11.780" style="s2">you have to listen first if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.590" end="00:34:15.980" style="s2">be listened to you have to listen to</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.780" end="00:34:17.840" style="s2">others first that&#39;s the key one one more</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.980" end="00:34:21.850" style="s2">quick thing if I may i I was just on a</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.840" end="00:34:24.290" style="s2">writing retreat with some friends and</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.850" end="00:34:26.440" style="s2">somebody came to that writing retreat</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.290" end="00:34:29.570" style="s2">who I&#39;d never met it was a stranger I</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.440" end="00:34:31.970" style="s2">really liked him really smart guy and he</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.570" end="00:34:32.870" style="s2">was also to say the least an auntie</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.970" end="00:34:34.850" style="s2">facin</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.870" end="00:34:37.610" style="s2">and we started having these</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.850" end="00:34:39.590" style="s2">conversations and I said to him in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.610" end="00:34:41.330" style="s2">course of these conversations I would</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.590" end="00:34:43.909" style="s2">love for you to get some of your buddies</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.330" end="00:34:44.780" style="s2">and have a conversation he said well</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.909" end="00:34:46.310" style="s2">what would you want to have a</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.780" end="00:34:48.260" style="s2">conversation with them about and I said</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.310" end="00:34:50.120" style="s2">he said what&#39;s the one thing you want to</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.260" end="00:34:52.399" style="s2">have a conversation with them about and</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.120" end="00:34:54.429" style="s2">I said I would want to know why they</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.399" end="00:34:58.220" style="s2">think physical violence is justified</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.429" end="00:35:00.830" style="s2">so one thing he said well you can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.220" end="00:35:02.750" style="s2">that you have to work up to that that</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.830" end="00:35:05.390" style="s2">takes you know a lot of talking and</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.750" end="00:35:08.030" style="s2">getting to know them etc and I thought</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.390" end="00:35:09.920" style="s2">to myself okay I&#39;m willing to do that</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.030" end="00:35:12.080" style="s2">but you shouldn&#39;t have to do that the</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.920" end="00:35:14.090" style="s2">problem is the dad value the value</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.080" end="00:35:18.560" style="s2">system that those folks have is so</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.090" end="00:35:20.540" style="s2">tainted and so corrupted that being</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.560" end="00:35:23.060" style="s2">willing to talk about why you would</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.540" end="00:35:24.830" style="s2">physically injure someone and perpetrate</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.060" end="00:35:26.480" style="s2">violence in them should be the first</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.830" end="00:35:29.840" style="s2">thing you talk about it shouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.480" end="00:35:31.700" style="s2">to be something you work up to I wonder</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.840" end="00:35:33.960" style="s2">if you&#39;ve considered this as well as the</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.700" end="00:35:36.359" style="s2">even in certain air</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.960" end="00:35:38.790" style="s2">for example you have Helen pluck rose</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.359" end="00:35:41.280" style="s2">and Heather hate hiring and a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.790" end="00:35:43.440" style="s2">other judges and in certain circles</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.280" end="00:35:45.960" style="s2">they&#39;re already quite and I know I know</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.440" end="00:35:49.079" style="s2">Helen finds it quite difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.960" end="00:35:50.670" style="s2">imagine that she has enemies but she&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.079" end="00:35:52.260" style="s2">controversial figure now on Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.670" end="00:35:55.020" style="s2">because of the grievous stand scant</p>

<p begin="00:35:55.020" end="00:35:59.250" style="s2">kind of culture war dynamics that are</p>

<p begin="00:35:59.250" end="00:36:06.660" style="s2">how how do how do you avoid how do you</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.859" end="00:36:09.329" style="s2">avoid looking like you&#39;re taking sides</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.660" end="00:36:11.400" style="s2">in the culture war when for some parts</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.329" end="00:36:13.770" style="s2">of the culture war even the whole idea</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.400" end="00:36:15.990" style="s2">of good-faith dialogue has been</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.770" end="00:36:17.550" style="s2">contaminated the idea of free speech</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.990" end="00:36:22.740" style="s2">they see is almost like this right-wing</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.550" end="00:36:24.690" style="s2">plot for hiding bigoted perspectives you</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.740" end="00:36:26.069" style="s2">must be aware of that dynamic and what</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.690" end="00:36:27.930" style="s2">what do you what do you make of it how</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.069" end="00:36:30.599" style="s2">do you how do you how do you work in an</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.930" end="00:36:34.260" style="s2">area where even those those values are</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.599" end="00:36:36.869" style="s2">now politicized yeah I mean I think at</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.260" end="00:36:40.349" style="s2">some at some point you have to decide</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.869" end="00:36:43.710" style="s2">which values matter the most and for</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.349" end="00:36:48.390" style="s2">people who think that good faith</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.710" end="00:36:50.490" style="s2">engagement is somehow radioactive that</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.390" end="00:36:52.829" style="s2">it probably isn&#39;t the platform for them</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.490" end="00:36:54.750" style="s2">although we would welcome them and we</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.829" end="00:36:58.410" style="s2">would encourage them to to come on and</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.750" end="00:37:02.450" style="s2">share their ideas if if the idea of a</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.410" end="00:37:04.530" style="s2">good faith conversation is political I</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.450" end="00:37:07.349" style="s2">don&#39;t know that you can even get to the</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.530" end="00:37:10.069" style="s2">starting line so I think from from that</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.349" end="00:37:12.780" style="s2">perspective free speech is paramount and</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.069" end="00:37:14.460" style="s2">regardless of what your ideas are if you</p>

<p begin="00:37:14.460" end="00:37:19.049" style="s2">there&#39;s nowhere to go and there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.990" end="00:37:22.589" style="s2">progress to be made and I think if that</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.049" end="00:37:24.299" style="s2">costs us a cohort of users that&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.589" end="00:37:26.880" style="s2">I think you have to worry about it but I</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.299" end="00:37:30.630" style="s2">think you have to push ahead regardless</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.880" end="00:37:34.020" style="s2">I think I think you can mitigate a lot</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.630" end="00:37:36.270" style="s2">of this through a genuine conversation I</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.020" end="00:37:40.349" style="s2">think what collect does is remarkable</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.270" end="00:37:43.380" style="s2">but they are standalone blogs and</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.349" end="00:37:47.370" style="s2">standalone standalone pieces all the</p>

<p begin="00:37:50.670" end="00:37:54.570" style="s2">I think that does mitigate that to some</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.590" end="00:37:56.400" style="s2">extent is that right at the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.570" end="00:37:58.830" style="s2">the piece you&#39;re getting two very</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.400" end="00:38:01.550" style="s2">different perspectives from people from</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.830" end="00:38:03.690" style="s2">often totally different parts of the</p>

<p begin="00:38:05.760" end="00:38:10.620" style="s2">but I think we&#39;re going to have to wade</p>

<p begin="00:38:54.240" end="00:39:00.420" style="s2">been weaponized itself or there seems to</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.960" end="00:39:01.740" style="s2">be a lot of skepticism about it from</p>

<p begin="00:39:14.430" end="00:39:19.320" style="s2">when some people see even that concept</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.370" end="00:39:23.270" style="s2">as a kind of stalking horse for</p>

<p begin="00:39:39.750" end="00:39:44.030" style="s2">it depends obviously if you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.790" end="00:39:47.340" style="s2">have that conversation and it&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="00:39:50.100" end="00:39:55.200" style="s2">is shutting it down and saying well you</p>

<p begin="00:39:59.250" end="00:40:04.319" style="s2">then that&#39;s what it</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.869" end="00:40:06.509" style="s2">the book does define impossible</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.319" end="00:40:08.670" style="s2">conversation by starting with saying</p>

<p begin="00:40:16.589" end="00:40:22.230" style="s2">what what&#39;s there so that becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.799" end="00:40:24.749" style="s2">difficulty but then if you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.230" end="00:40:26.910" style="s2">about that idea and trying to get to</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.749" end="00:40:30.900" style="s2">that idea so okay let&#39;s look at this</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.910" end="00:40:32.880" style="s2">is talking about certain ideas your is</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.900" end="00:40:36.450" style="s2">free speech itself you know a stalking</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.880" end="00:40:39.839" style="s2">stalking horse for bigotry or some evil</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.450" end="00:40:42.630" style="s2">or supremacy or whatever that itself is</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.839" end="00:40:44.309" style="s2">a conversation topic you know is is that</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.630" end="00:40:45.960" style="s2">something you really believe why do you</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.309" end="00:40:47.220" style="s2">believe it let&#39;s how did you arrive at</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.960" end="00:40:50.099" style="s2">that conclusion can you give me some</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.220" end="00:40:52.650" style="s2">examples of why you you know where that</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.099" end="00:40:55.619" style="s2">goes awry and you know you can start to</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.650" end="00:40:57.690" style="s2">try to ask questions and dig into</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.619" end="00:41:00.509" style="s2">somebody&#39;s epistemology you can start</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.690" end="00:41:02.039" style="s2">asking them questions to help yourself</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.509" end="00:41:03.599" style="s2">understand their perspective better at</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.039" end="00:41:06.930" style="s2">the end of the day one of the last</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.599" end="00:41:08.960" style="s2">things is if somebody won&#39;t have a</p>

<p begin="00:41:08.960" end="00:41:13.319" style="s2">productive you can always default to</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.579" end="00:41:15.089" style="s2">just trying to learn why they believe</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.319" end="00:41:19.799" style="s2">what they believe it doesn&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.089" end="00:41:21.749" style="s2">turn into some you know some set of</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.799" end="00:41:23.190" style="s2">agreement or even to say something like</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.749" end="00:41:24.569" style="s2">what we agreed to disagree you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.190" end="00:41:26.700" style="s2">even have to go there you can just I</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.569" end="00:41:29.069" style="s2">okay I don&#39;t understand your perspective</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.700" end="00:41:31.170" style="s2">instead of saying I disagree with that</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.069" end="00:41:32.940" style="s2">that you I don&#39;t even understand that</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.170" end="00:41:34.319" style="s2">can you just I just want to hear all you</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.940" end="00:41:35.819" style="s2">have to say about that and help me</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.319" end="00:41:40.140" style="s2">understand it and let them do a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.819" end="00:41:42.059" style="s2">the talking maybe all that happens as</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.140" end="00:41:44.160" style="s2">you listen and you learn maybe you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:41:44.160" end="00:41:47.789" style="s2">can be convinced that there&#39;s a point</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.410" end="00:41:49.589" style="s2">there but you didn&#39;t understand like for</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.789" end="00:41:51.480" style="s2">example when I spoke the Christians and</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.589" end="00:41:52.739" style="s2">like well I don&#39;t like their point and I</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.480" end="00:41:54.989" style="s2">don&#39;t agree with the point but at least</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.739" end="00:41:59.789" style="s2">I see there is a point they&#39;re not</p>

<p begin="00:41:59.789" end="00:42:02.849" style="s2">situations where we talked about a</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.349" end="00:42:06.779" style="s2">couple of different examples in the book</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.849" end="00:42:09.140" style="s2">of well-known cognitive effects where</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.779" end="00:42:11.099" style="s2">people speak into their own ignorance</p>

<p begin="00:42:11.099" end="00:42:14.040" style="s2">moderating their own beliefs just by</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.720" end="00:42:16.860" style="s2">talking too much</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.040" end="00:42:18.960" style="s2">um not in the sense you know that you</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.860" end="00:42:20.220" style="s2">might say with a interviewer giving</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.960" end="00:42:23.160" style="s2">someone enough rope for them to hang</p>

<p begin="00:42:28.610" end="00:42:32.520" style="s2">many people heard of the dunning-kruger</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.510" end="00:42:34.260" style="s2">effect a lot of the things that we speak</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.520" end="00:42:38.430" style="s2">about we don&#39;t know as well as we think</p>

<p begin="00:42:39.900" end="00:42:43.110" style="s2">effect that&#39;s been described called the</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.280" end="00:42:46.350" style="s2">illusion of explanatory depth that we</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.110" end="00:42:48.270" style="s2">discuss in the book and in that people</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.350" end="00:42:49.890" style="s2">tend to think they know some things</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.270" end="00:42:51.630" style="s2">better than they do because they know</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.890" end="00:42:53.520" style="s2">that other people know them and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.630" end="00:42:58.740" style="s2">kind of leaning on the fact that it is</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.520" end="00:43:01.470" style="s2">known to to extend their own expertise</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.740" end="00:43:03.270" style="s2">and so if you actually have them just</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.470" end="00:43:06.810" style="s2">keep describing you know how will that</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.270" end="00:43:09.270" style="s2">work okay so you know you see free</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.810" end="00:43:12.450" style="s2">speech is a stalking horse for for for</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.270" end="00:43:14.400" style="s2">suppressed supremacy but how does it</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.450" end="00:43:16.410" style="s2">work in practice so if we limit hate</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.400" end="00:43:19.050" style="s2">speech and then somebody comes along and</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.410" end="00:43:20.120" style="s2">defines you know what what minority</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.050" end="00:43:22.440" style="s2">group is trying to say is hate speech</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.120" end="00:43:24.990" style="s2">what happens then and you just let them</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.440" end="00:43:26.910" style="s2">talk a lot of times they&#39;ll they&#39;ll find</p>

<p begin="00:43:28.290" end="00:43:34.260" style="s2">examined and will go away with moderated</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.580" end="00:43:36.000" style="s2">beliefs a couple of cognitive scientists</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.260" end="00:43:37.500" style="s2">showed this with with mundane things and</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.000" end="00:43:41.760" style="s2">a couple more showed it that it happens</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.500" end="00:43:44.340" style="s2">with political beliefs as well so that</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.760" end="00:43:48.360" style="s2">itself becomes a discussion topic but if</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.340" end="00:43:50.330" style="s2">it is in a situation where and hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.360" end="00:43:53.490" style="s2">people can change their mind on that one</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.330" end="00:43:54.810" style="s2">but if it comes to the point where</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.490" end="00:43:57.450" style="s2">you&#39;re actually trying to have dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.810" end="00:43:59.280" style="s2">with somebody who doesn&#39;t want to all</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.450" end="00:44:00.840" style="s2">you can do is shake their hand and thank</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.280" end="00:44:03.900" style="s2">them for their time and can&#39;t go away</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.840" end="00:44:05.340" style="s2">sometimes that&#39;s the limit and or you</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.900" end="00:44:07.080" style="s2">can switch goals like you know what</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.340" end="00:44:09.870" style="s2">screw it let&#39;s just talk about frisbee</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.080" end="00:44:13.020" style="s2">you know we both we both like tacos</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.870" end="00:44:14.280" style="s2">let&#39;s go there and just change the</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.020" end="00:44:16.140" style="s2">subject and do something different</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.280" end="00:44:18.000" style="s2">sometimes but it&#39;s just how it is you</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.140" end="00:44:19.880" style="s2">talk later in the book about how</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.000" end="00:44:22.260" style="s2">difficult the most difficult</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.880" end="00:44:25.680" style="s2">conversations are when you&#39;re dealing at</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.260" end="00:44:27.480" style="s2">the level of values yes why do we feel</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.680" end="00:44:28.950" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.480" end="00:44:31.140" style="s2">oh there&#39;s been neuroscience on this</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.950" end="00:44:33.450" style="s2">that shows that when our values are</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.140" end="00:44:36.480" style="s2">contradicted or when people if that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.450" end="00:44:40.500" style="s2">as if people are threatening our self</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.480" end="00:44:41.750" style="s2">our physical person why is that why do</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.500" end="00:44:44.760" style="s2">you think that&#39;s the case</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.750" end="00:44:46.790" style="s2">well let&#39;s unpack that before we talk</p>

<p begin="00:44:50.730" end="00:44:56.310" style="s2">salience that&#39;s when those beliefs are</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.670" end="00:44:58.440" style="s2">very difficult to revise so moral</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.310" end="00:45:00.840" style="s2">beliefs in general but beliefs that</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.440" end="00:45:02.609" style="s2">relate to identity in particular that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.840" end="00:45:04.890" style="s2">why when you have conversations with</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.609" end="00:45:06.810" style="s2">people and we&#39;re kind of jumping into</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.890" end="00:45:09.420" style="s2">the end of the book you know you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:45:09.420" end="00:45:12.869" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be over glossed but that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.430" end="00:45:15.119" style="s2">when you have conversations with folks</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.869" end="00:45:16.859" style="s2">the conversations about moral issues are</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.119" end="00:45:18.840" style="s2">very difficult because it relates to</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.859" end="00:45:20.550" style="s2">their sense of personal identity good</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.840" end="00:45:23.160" style="s2">people believe this I am a good person</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.550" end="00:45:24.990" style="s2">therefore I believe this it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.160" end="00:45:27.330" style="s2">interesting I do an exercise in class</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.990" end="00:45:29.040" style="s2">when I ask people what percentage of</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.330" end="00:45:31.320" style="s2">their beliefs they think are true and</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.040" end="00:45:34.980" style="s2">sometimes people find that jarring and I</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.320" end="00:45:37.050" style="s2">write the numbers 90 you know 100 90 80</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.980" end="00:45:40.140" style="s2">and and then after a couple of questions</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.050" end="00:45:42.030" style="s2">I all right up you know five people</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.140" end="00:45:43.800" style="s2">believe it&#39;s 94 people believe</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.030" end="00:45:45.600" style="s2">occasional actually I get some people</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.800" end="00:45:47.700" style="s2">around the 30s which is I don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.600" end="00:45:49.800" style="s2">they navigate reality but then I&#39;ll give</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.700" end="00:45:51.540" style="s2">another scale and say what percentage of</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.800" end="00:45:54.060" style="s2">your moral beliefs do you think are true</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.540" end="00:45:57.000" style="s2">or your religious beliefs and then those</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.060" end="00:45:59.160" style="s2">numbers are far higher but the exact</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.000" end="00:46:01.440" style="s2">opposite should be the case right that</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.160" end="00:46:03.780" style="s2">that the beliefs for which you have less</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.440" end="00:46:05.369" style="s2">evidence you should hold them in less</p>

<p begin="00:46:58.950" end="00:47:03.720" style="s2">cared about me so it gave that belief an</p>

<p begin="00:48:54.690" end="00:49:00.240" style="s2">so so I think Ricky</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.990" end="00:49:02.670" style="s2">I think the wiki project and the</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.240" end="00:49:04.710" style="s2">Rathbones are fantastic I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.670" end="00:49:06.210" style="s2">exactly what we need at this point in</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.710" end="00:49:08.160" style="s2">our culture we need to have</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.210" end="00:49:11.130" style="s2">conversations we need to be talking</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.160" end="00:49:12.750" style="s2">across divides and I also think see I</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.130" end="00:49:16.080" style="s2">just use a technique from the book I</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.750" end="00:49:20.040" style="s2">used and instead of but and I also think</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.080" end="00:49:22.740" style="s2">that excuse me I think that part of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.040" end="00:49:24.840" style="s2">problem is that it&#39;s like in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.740" end="00:49:27.660" style="s2">presidential debates when you&#39;re winning</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.840" end="00:49:29.220" style="s2">you want fewer debates and when you I</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.660" end="00:49:31.110" style="s2">don&#39;t know how I&#39;m setting about in</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.220" end="00:49:33.270" style="s2">American context I can&#39;t speak and I</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.110" end="00:49:36.180" style="s2">don&#39;t have know it yes the same in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.270" end="00:49:40.260" style="s2">UK yeah okay so so when you&#39;re winning</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.180" end="00:49:42.930" style="s2">in the polls you want no debates and the</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.260" end="00:49:45.830" style="s2">the loser person is currently losing</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.930" end="00:49:48.450" style="s2">wants a lot of debates so currently</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.830" end="00:49:51.240" style="s2">intersectionality is dominating the</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.450" end="00:49:53.220" style="s2">cultural landscape so they don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.240" end="00:49:54.630" style="s2">want to have those conversations because</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.220" end="00:49:58.020" style="s2">they&#39;re winning the cultural war at this</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.630" end="00:50:00.240" style="s2">point so the question is how do we get</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.020" end="00:50:02.190" style="s2">back to helping people value the right</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.240" end="00:50:04.410" style="s2">things and part of what it means to</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.190" end="00:50:08.100" style="s2">value the right things is discourse</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.410" end="00:50:09.960" style="s2">dialogue and open conversation so once</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.100" end="00:50:10.380" style="s2">you leave the good news that&#39;s the bad</p>

<p begin="00:54:06.450" end="00:54:13.350" style="s2">couldn&#39;t actually engage that idea so</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.240" end="00:54:15.900" style="s2">it&#39;s just really impossible to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.350" end="00:54:18.540" style="s2">somebody who is that deeply entrenched</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.900" end="00:54:20.580" style="s2">in the beliefs but most of us aren&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.540" end="00:54:22.650" style="s2">think the best we can do with those who</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.580" end="00:54:25.040" style="s2">are really entrenched is to marginalize</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.650" end="00:54:27.540" style="s2">them get them more widely recognized as</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.040" end="00:54:31.500" style="s2">extremists making unsubstantiated claims</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.540" end="00:54:33.210" style="s2">so who would be your ideal which people</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.500" end="00:54:35.640" style="s2">would you love to see in dialog with</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.210" end="00:54:37.890" style="s2">each other that&#39;s something you really</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.640" end="00:54:41.190" style="s2">need to give me a bit more time to think</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.890" end="00:54:45.630" style="s2">about I&#39;m afraid so I don&#39;t know I mean</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.190" end="00:54:47.430" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen Richard Dawkins and Brett</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.630" end="00:54:50.430" style="s2">Weinstein having a conversation I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.430" end="00:54:54.450" style="s2">quite like them to continue that Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.430" end="00:54:58.800" style="s2">Peterson and Noam Chomsky would be would</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.450" end="00:55:00.450" style="s2">be good I think I always think they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.800" end="00:55:02.940" style="s2">talked a lot there with sam Harris and</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.450" end="00:55:04.950" style="s2">and drawing Peterson they tend to break</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.940" end="00:55:06.960" style="s2">they tend to come up against each other</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.950" end="00:55:08.850" style="s2">in ways that are interesting to me from</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.960" end="00:55:13.080" style="s2">someone who shows the epistemology of</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.850" end="00:55:16.170" style="s2">Sam Harris but otherwise politically I</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.080" end="00:55:17.370" style="s2">don&#39;t know no it was good there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.170" end="00:55:18.840" style="s2">really good names I think a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.370" end="00:55:21.990" style="s2">people would be very interested to see</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.840" end="00:55:23.250" style="s2">those those dialogues yeah I have</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.990" end="00:55:24.240" style="s2">thought of two people that I would</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.250" end="00:55:27.930" style="s2">actually like to have a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.240" end="00:55:30.540" style="s2">with now great so there&#39;s Jose</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.930" end="00:55:32.910" style="s2">deena now here&#39;s the writer of</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.540" end="00:55:35.190" style="s2">epistemologies of resistance and i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.910" end="00:55:38.570" style="s2">used his work a lot my think his work is</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.190" end="00:55:40.620" style="s2">brilliant the way that he is looking at</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.570" end="00:55:43.470" style="s2">epistemological vices and</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.620" end="00:55:47.240" style="s2">epistemological thirties but he argues</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.470" end="00:55:50.550" style="s2">that people who have the virtues are</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.240" end="00:55:53.700" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s related to identity so if you</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.550" end="00:55:55.590" style="s2">have a privileged identity your your</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.700" end="00:55:58.530" style="s2">discourses your understanding society</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.590" end="00:55:59.640" style="s2">are dominant and so you can&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.530" end="00:56:01.830" style="s2">anything else whereas if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.640" end="00:56:03.420" style="s2">marginalized person you can see the</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.830" end="00:56:05.730" style="s2">dominant system and you also have your</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.420" end="00:56:08.040" style="s2">own so you have a greater wider</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.730" end="00:56:10.590" style="s2">knowledge and you can see outside your</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.040" end="00:56:14.160" style="s2">own system now I think his analysis</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.590" end="00:56:16.740" style="s2">would be really rigorous and good if it</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.160" end="00:56:18.090" style="s2">wasn&#39;t related to identity if it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.740" end="00:56:19.440" style="s2">assume that all women thought the same</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.090" end="00:56:21.450" style="s2">way I can black people thought the same</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.440" end="00:56:24.630" style="s2">way but if he applied it to echo</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.450" end="00:56:26.490" style="s2">chambers ideological groups so I would</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.630" end="00:56:28.320" style="s2">really like to have a conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.490" end="00:56:31.200" style="s2">him about that</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.320" end="00:56:33.210" style="s2">and Christy Dotson leading black</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.200" end="00:56:35.490" style="s2">feminist epistemologists she&#39;s somebody</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.210" end="00:56:39.240" style="s2">else I I really would like to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.490" end="00:56:41.940" style="s2">because I read her work and you can just</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.240" end="00:56:43.740" style="s2">tell how clear she is trying to be and</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.940" end="00:56:45.630" style="s2">she really is she actually that she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.740" end="00:56:46.950" style="s2">introducing really complex things but</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.630" end="00:56:49.890" style="s2">she&#39;s taking the reader long she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.950" end="00:56:51.990" style="s2">reminding about she&#39;s very sincere and</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.890" end="00:56:56.570" style="s2">rigorous but again she&#39;s starting from</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.990" end="00:57:00.240" style="s2">the problem of epistemological sort of</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.570" end="00:57:02.250" style="s2">identity so again knowledge depends on</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.240" end="00:57:04.520" style="s2">what race she well what sexual so I</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.250" end="00:57:06.900" style="s2">think she goes very wrong but and she</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.520" end="00:57:09.000" style="s2">also talks about a culture of</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.900" end="00:57:11.220" style="s2">justification and so she&#39;s against the</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.000" end="00:57:13.410" style="s2">idea that we need evidence for things</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.220" end="00:57:16.740" style="s2">but when I read her I can&#39;t help but</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.410" end="00:57:19.620" style="s2">think if you just started from a premise</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.740" end="00:57:21.720" style="s2">of of evidence-based reason and</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.620" end="00:57:23.700" style="s2">individuality your work would be so</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.720" end="00:57:26.430" style="s2">valuable on how we understand knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.700" end="00:57:29.640" style="s2">so I would like to talk to both of them</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.430" end="00:57:32.570" style="s2">and actually yet suggest to them ask</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.640" end="00:57:34.800" style="s2">them how they would like how they could</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.570" end="00:57:36.360" style="s2">could how I could apply their work</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.800" end="00:57:38.190" style="s2">differently and if they thought there</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.360" end="00:57:40.430" style="s2">was any value in that or if I completely</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.190" end="00:57:43.760" style="s2">missed the point you talk in the book</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.430" end="00:57:47.540" style="s2">out you said almost like ninja level</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.760" end="00:57:51.980" style="s2">techniques coming from hostage hostage</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.540" end="00:57:52.670" style="s2">negotiation and cult deprogramming so</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.980" end="00:57:54.530" style="s2">there&#39;s all the gaps or the</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.670" end="00:57:56.990" style="s2">conversational techniques I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.530" end="00:57:58.490" style="s2">suspicion is I&#39;d love to hear a couple</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.990" end="00:58:00.560" style="s2">of those first before you kind of get</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.490" end="00:58:03.410" style="s2">into get into it what what do you think</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.560" end="00:58:06.890" style="s2">is the most useful techniques that you</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.410" end="00:58:08.720" style="s2">are in the book well for me the most</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.890" end="00:58:12.410" style="s2">useful technique is certainly not one of</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.720" end="00:58:14.390" style="s2">the ninja ones it is actually let</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.410" end="00:58:16.070" style="s2">friends be wrong and I have a very</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.390" end="00:58:17.330" style="s2">expensive definition of friends if</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.070" end="00:58:19.580" style="s2">you&#39;re having a conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.330" end="00:58:21.050" style="s2">somebody if for all intents and purposes</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.580" end="00:58:25.430" style="s2">I think that you should treat them as</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.050" end="00:58:28.040" style="s2">though your that your friends so the</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.430" end="00:58:31.460" style="s2">most important technique for me is that</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.040" end="00:58:34.340" style="s2">if if you have some ludicrous belief and</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.460" end="00:58:37.370" style="s2">you&#39;re really entrenched in it</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.340" end="00:58:39.400" style="s2">I don&#39;t have to change your mind we can</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.370" end="00:58:43.670" style="s2">focus on other aspects of a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.400" end="00:58:45.440" style="s2">we can I can let you be wrong and become</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.670" end="00:58:46.880" style="s2">curious about what you believe in why</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.440" end="00:58:48.860" style="s2">you believe it and ask questions to</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.880" end="00:58:50.510" style="s2">understand it better and that may or may</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.860" end="00:58:52.820" style="s2">not lead you to change your mind but it</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.510" end="00:58:56.180" style="s2">will at least generate trust between us</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.820" end="00:58:59.300" style="s2">it will engender better understanding</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.180" end="00:59:00.650" style="s2">you will feel heard I will understand</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.300" end="00:59:02.480" style="s2">better where you&#39;re coming from even if</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.650" end="00:59:05.060" style="s2">I think you&#39;re absolutely insane as a</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.480" end="00:59:07.120" style="s2">result and so letting people be wrong is</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.060" end="00:59:09.890" style="s2">I think something we&#39;ve really lost</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.120" end="00:59:11.990" style="s2">another not a ninja level technique in</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.890" end="00:59:13.730" style="s2">the early in the book the first one</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.990" end="00:59:15.500" style="s2">mentioned is defining conversational</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.730" end="00:59:18.140" style="s2">goals and so everything in a</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.500" end="00:59:20.600" style="s2">conversation really depends upon knowing</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.140" end="00:59:23.050" style="s2">why you&#39;re having the conversation so if</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.600" end="00:59:27.430" style="s2">you and I are having a conversation to</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.050" end="00:59:31.130" style="s2">achieve some workplace and you know and</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.430" end="00:59:33.650" style="s2">I start making it about football I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.130" end="00:59:36.260" style="s2">gone off the track right or if I start</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.650" end="00:59:37.940" style="s2">talking about my fight with my wife or</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.260" end="00:59:40.160" style="s2">something like that I&#39;ve gone I&#39;m no</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.940" end="00:59:42.590" style="s2">longer attending the goal of that</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.160" end="00:59:44.000" style="s2">conversation and I would insist that one</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.590" end="00:59:45.590" style="s2">of the goals that you should always have</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.000" end="00:59:48.320" style="s2">or nearly always have in most</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.590" end="00:59:50.570" style="s2">conversations is to have a goal of</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.320" end="00:59:53.000" style="s2">maintaining a positive relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.570" end="00:59:54.740" style="s2">that person and so that starts to</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.000" end="00:59:55.910" style="s2">delimit how far</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.740" end="00:59:58.369" style="s2">you should be willing to go when you</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.910" end="00:59:59.840" style="s2">argue or whatever maybe the situation is</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.369" end="01:00:01.910" style="s2">you&#39;re sitting down in to your family</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.840" end="01:00:04.040" style="s2">dinner and you have that uncle or cousin</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.910" end="01:00:06.860" style="s2">or brother who just won&#39;t leave it alone</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.040" end="01:00:08.960" style="s2">how do you navigate that you know that</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.860" end="01:00:11.660" style="s2">kind of thing understanding the goal</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.960" end="01:00:13.760" style="s2">there is to try to have a positive a net</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.660" end="01:00:15.470" style="s2">positive experience at the dinner table</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.760" end="01:00:18.230" style="s2">rather than turning it into a family</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.470" end="01:00:19.730" style="s2">fight it is really important if you want</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.230" end="01:00:23.420" style="s2">to look at kind of the ninja level stuff</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.730" end="01:00:25.430" style="s2">or talk about the hostage negotiation</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.420" end="01:00:27.619" style="s2">there are a few techniques that I really</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.430" end="01:00:28.880" style="s2">like from a hostage negotiation I mean</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.619" end="01:00:31.070" style="s2">I&#39;m not one of these kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.880" end="01:00:35.510" style="s2">conversational mastermind type people</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.070" end="01:00:39.980" style="s2">but one that I find has a lot of value</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.510" end="01:00:42.890" style="s2">from hostage negotiation is to repeat</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.980" end="01:00:44.869" style="s2">back it&#39;s a kind of conversational</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.890" end="01:00:47.119" style="s2">mirroring is to repeat back a few words</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.869" end="01:00:50.240" style="s2">of what the person just said almost as a</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.119" end="01:00:51.980" style="s2">question it nearly always will get the</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.240" end="01:00:54.050" style="s2">person to continue talking and to say</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.980" end="01:00:56.600" style="s2">more hostage negotiators are often</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.050" end="01:01:00.950" style="s2">trying to get the criminal there</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.600" end="01:01:02.690" style="s2">speaking with to admit some piece of</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.950" end="01:01:05.720" style="s2">information that they can then use as</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.690" end="01:01:09.410" style="s2">leverage to end the crisis and so they</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.720" end="01:01:11.210" style="s2">very frequently will try to a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.410" end="01:01:13.100" style="s2">their techniques are meant to keep the</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.210" end="01:01:15.109" style="s2">person as calm as possible while keeping</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.100" end="01:01:16.369" style="s2">them talking as much as possible because</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.109" end="01:01:19.960" style="s2">when there&#39;s silence there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.369" end="01:01:22.550" style="s2">possibility of progress so for example</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.960" end="01:01:26.590" style="s2">somebody might come in and say to you</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.550" end="01:01:28.730" style="s2">just as a very kind of banal example</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.590" end="01:01:30.740" style="s2">yeah so I just got back from the grocery</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.730" end="01:01:33.650" style="s2">store and you say got back from the</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.740" end="01:01:35.630" style="s2">grocery store that&#39;s it and then they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.650" end="01:01:37.340" style="s2">very likely say yah yah yah yah I went</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.630" end="01:01:39.800" style="s2">to the grocery store to get chicken and</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.340" end="01:01:41.780" style="s2">he say yeah to get chicken in if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.800" end="01:01:43.070" style="s2">silly is I mean it sounds these people</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.780" end="01:01:44.300" style="s2">off if you say it with the right tone</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.070" end="01:01:45.859" style="s2">and that you&#39;re actually engaging with</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.300" end="01:01:47.300" style="s2">them I&#39;m not doing it well and</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.859" end="01:01:48.590" style="s2">hypothetical but in a real</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.300" end="01:01:50.240" style="s2">conversational environment it works a</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.590" end="01:01:51.530" style="s2">little better let&#39;s say yeah I was</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.240" end="01:01:53.420" style="s2">thinking about making chicken parmesan</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.530" end="01:01:56.150" style="s2">for dinner tonight you know you say well</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.420" end="01:01:57.290" style="s2">yeah chicken parmesan and then now</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.150" end="01:01:59.600" style="s2">they&#39;re talking about you know I really</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.290" end="01:02:01.670" style="s2">love Italian food and it actually is a</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.600" end="01:02:03.290" style="s2">technique that is not just used in</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.670" end="01:02:06.950" style="s2">hostage negotiation it&#39;s actually used</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.290" end="01:02:08.380" style="s2">by clinical psychologists as well to get</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.950" end="01:02:10.329" style="s2">people to open up and talk</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.380" end="01:02:12.099" style="s2">more so if you&#39;re trying to get people</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.329" end="01:02:13.750" style="s2">to open up about their beliefs and</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.099" end="01:02:15.190" style="s2">understand where they&#39;re coming from in</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.750" end="01:02:17.319" style="s2">a better level that&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.190" end="01:02:19.390" style="s2">technique derived spring from hostage</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.319" end="01:02:21.549" style="s2">negotiation or clinical psychology that</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.390" end="01:02:23.440" style="s2">anybody can apply with a little bit of</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.549" end="01:02:25.359" style="s2">familiarity in practice you can do it in</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.440" end="01:02:27.190" style="s2">a natural way I&#39;ve been doing it to my</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.359" end="01:02:28.900" style="s2">daughter for months and she had no idea</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.190" end="01:02:30.670" style="s2">I was doing it until he finally had an</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.900" end="01:02:32.890" style="s2">open conversation about it the other day</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.670" end="01:02:34.420" style="s2">when I told her I was doing it and she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.890" end="01:02:37.180" style="s2">like I didn&#39;t even notice and I know</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.420" end="01:02:39.220" style="s2">that technique because she had been</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.180" end="01:02:41.200" style="s2">studying to be a psychologist herself</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.220" end="01:02:43.019" style="s2">and she had no idea I was doing it to</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.200" end="01:02:45.160" style="s2">her it&#39;s just to keeps a person</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.019" end="01:02:47.710" style="s2">open-ended and talking more so that</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.160" end="01:02:49.809" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s more of a kind of ninja</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.710" end="01:02:51.369" style="s2">level technique to keep somebody opening</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.809" end="01:02:54.039" style="s2">up and providing information that you</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.369" end="01:02:55.809" style="s2">can then you know ask other questions</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.039" end="01:02:58.210" style="s2">about or connect over or whatever the</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.809" end="01:03:00.220" style="s2">goal of the conversation is I just</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.210" end="01:03:03.160" style="s2">wanted to pick up on you mentioning the</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.220" end="01:03:06.460" style="s2">sort of the friends things you do have</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.160" end="01:03:08.259" style="s2">quite a cognitive reputation on online</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.460" end="01:03:11.289" style="s2">and on Twitter oh yeah</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.259" end="01:03:13.240" style="s2">I don&#39;t count I don&#39;t this people will</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.289" end="01:03:16.180" style="s2">consider this deeply hypocritical I</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.240" end="01:03:18.220" style="s2">don&#39;t consider I don&#39;t consider Twitter</p>

<p begin="01:03:46.960" end="01:03:50.769" style="s2">metaphor is is to think of like a</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.490" end="01:03:53.740" style="s2">schoolyard playground or a park having a</p>

<p begin="01:05:21.910" end="01:05:25.960" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of fun to be had if you</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.950" end="01:05:27.760" style="s2">don&#39;t worry about that and just use the</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.960" end="01:05:29.350" style="s2">platform as it&#39;s actually designed and</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.760" end="01:05:30.940" style="s2">lean into it but if you want to have a</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.350" end="01:05:32.290" style="s2">conversation take it somewhere more</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.940" end="01:05:33.940" style="s2">private we actually have a section in</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.290" end="01:05:35.950" style="s2">the book talking about social media and</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.940" end="01:05:39.400" style="s2">the different platforms to some degree</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.950" end="01:05:41.350" style="s2">and why they are even even private</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.400" end="01:05:46.060" style="s2">message text message type communication</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.350" end="01:05:48.750" style="s2">is sorely limited and so while there are</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.060" end="01:05:51.040" style="s2">some advantages to it I would say that</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.750" end="01:05:55.030" style="s2">that which is taking place in the public</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.040" end="01:05:57.160" style="s2">forum of whether it&#39;s messages like like</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.030" end="01:05:59.350" style="s2">on Twitter I mean or on Facebook or like</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.160" end="01:06:00.460" style="s2">in discussion forums is something like</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.350" end="01:06:02.110" style="s2">that it&#39;s a very different environment</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.460" end="01:06:04.720" style="s2">you&#39;re not actually having a</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.110" end="01:06:05.830" style="s2">conversation at that point and when</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.720" end="01:06:08.770" style="s2">you&#39;re ready to have a real conversation</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.830" end="01:06:11.080" style="s2">send some what they note and engage you</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.770" end="01:06:13.180" style="s2">know in a more direct and human way</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.080" end="01:06:16.390" style="s2">rather than this weird performance way I</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.180" end="01:06:17.860" style="s2">mean I&#39;m thinking about the interaction</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.390" end="01:06:20.380" style="s2">you have with Nicholas Grossman and the</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.860" end="01:06:24.520" style="s2">article that you wrote for arc digital</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.380" end="01:06:26.110" style="s2">um I mean is it not even I hear what</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.520" end="01:06:30.040" style="s2">you&#39;re saying about it Twitter&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.110" end="01:06:31.540" style="s2">right platform but do you regret that do</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.040" end="01:06:34.900" style="s2">you regret having kind of articles out</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.540" end="01:06:36.820" style="s2">there saying don&#39;t don&#39;t preach</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.900" end="01:06:40.870" style="s2">constructive disagreements if you&#39;re not</p>

<p begin="01:06:40.870" end="01:06:45.400" style="s2">very odd bird in this way I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.300" end="01:06:48.790" style="s2">actually think the hypocrisy means very</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.400" end="01:06:49.810" style="s2">much I don&#39;t I don&#39;t really care if</p>

<p begin="01:06:52.750" end="01:06:57.490" style="s2">me not to use heroin I might think of</p>

<p begin="01:07:02.200" end="01:07:06.760" style="s2">but again the Twitter environment I</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.720" end="01:07:08.770" style="s2">don&#39;t really regret any of the public</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.760" end="01:07:12.010" style="s2">behavior that I have on Twitter almost</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.770" end="01:07:14.320" style="s2">ever because it&#39;s just not conducive so</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.010" end="01:07:18.300" style="s2">I get stuff sent to me all the time and</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.320" end="01:07:21.430" style="s2">so Nicholas rehearse man for example I</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.300" end="01:07:22.930" style="s2">don&#39;t mean to be rude but this messages</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.430" end="01:07:25.810" style="s2">came to me I don&#39;t know who this guy is</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.930" end="01:07:28.420" style="s2">he&#39;s nobody he doesn&#39;t I have no context</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.810" end="01:07:30.130" style="s2">into which he&#39;s inserted himself he said</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.420" end="01:07:32.560" style="s2">some stuff about being an expert about a</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.130" end="01:07:36.430" style="s2">topic but the things that he said seem</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.560" end="01:07:39.610" style="s2">to both be combative and to stand on on</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.430" end="01:07:41.320" style="s2">their on the head of things that I</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.610" end="01:07:45.640" style="s2">seemed I think that I know about the</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.320" end="01:07:48.340" style="s2">topic and so he&#39;s kind of doing this</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.640" end="01:07:50.530" style="s2">whole like you know let&#39;s smack let</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.340" end="01:07:52.060" style="s2">smack this guy down attitude which is</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.530" end="01:07:54.610" style="s2">fine I do that on Twitter all the time</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.060" end="01:07:56.680" style="s2">okay right hypocrisy but if you want to</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.610" end="01:07:58.420" style="s2">try to create a conversation out of it</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.680" end="01:08:01.600" style="s2">that&#39;s literally exactly the wrong way</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.420" end="01:08:03.550" style="s2">to go I didn&#39;t reach out to him first at</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.600" end="01:08:06.190" style="s2">all lol that&#39;s all I had to say about</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.550" end="01:08:07.990" style="s2">his view it he could have followed up</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.190" end="01:08:09.340" style="s2">with me in a more private way I guess I</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.990" end="01:08:11.770" style="s2">could have as well but I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.340" end="01:08:14.590" style="s2">particularly interested in getting into</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.770" end="01:08:18.880" style="s2">what for me was a tangential issue on</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.590" end="01:08:21.790" style="s2">the matter I don&#39;t actually care that</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.880" end="01:08:23.650" style="s2">much about the nitty gritties about that</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.790" end="01:08:25.810" style="s2">topic happened to be terrorism I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.650" end="01:08:30.069" style="s2">I&#39;m not an expert in that I don&#39;t care I</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.810" end="01:08:31.200" style="s2">guess the end i&#39;m asking is because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.069" end="01:08:33.430" style="s2">quite easy</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.200" end="01:08:34.960" style="s2">like the actual habit I think if you</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.430" end="01:08:37.450" style="s2">asked anyone to say how do you have a</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.960" end="01:08:38.950" style="s2">constructive conversation they&#39;d be able</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.450" end="01:08:40.420" style="s2">to say well you&#39;ve got to respect what</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.950" end="01:08:41.650" style="s2">your opponent saying you&#39;ve got to take</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.420" end="01:08:43.600" style="s2">them seriously you&#39;ve got to not be</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.650" end="01:08:47.140" style="s2">dismissive like we can all list those</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.600" end="01:08:48.639" style="s2">things but the doing of it seems to be</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.140" end="01:08:50.199" style="s2">but we all get into</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.639" end="01:08:52.060" style="s2">we all know this and we yet we get into</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.199" end="01:08:54.009" style="s2">arguments all the time though I think</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.060" end="01:08:55.719" style="s2">there is something about whether we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.009" end="01:08:59.679" style="s2">actually modeling that behave yourselves</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.719" end="01:09:04.089" style="s2">that does that is relevant to the to the</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.679" end="01:09:07.600" style="s2">conversation sure sure um and again it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.089" end="01:09:09.069" style="s2">it&#39;s contextual I don&#39;t feel like that I</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.600" end="01:09:10.630" style="s2">mean I&#39;m not trying to defend myself if</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.069" end="01:09:11.949" style="s2">people don&#39;t like me because of this but</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.630" end="01:09:13.119" style="s2">think I&#39;m wrong I&#39;m fine with that too</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.949" end="01:09:16.960" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t bother me one way or the</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.119" end="01:09:19.630" style="s2">other I don&#39;t think that the public</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.960" end="01:09:21.009" style="s2">facing Twitter context is one that</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.630" end="01:09:23.109" style="s2">people should be trying to have</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.009" end="01:09:25.750" style="s2">conversation via at all in fact I think</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.109" end="01:09:27.580" style="s2">that that&#39;s a mistake direct messages</p>

<p begin="01:10:18.219" end="01:10:22.840" style="s2">conversation and as I think sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.400" end="01:10:25.960" style="s2">you know goes with Twitter culture I</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.840" end="01:10:28.900" style="s2">maybe came in a little hot but what</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.960" end="01:10:31.780" style="s2">started it was there were a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.900" end="01:10:34.000" style="s2">attention being paid to demonstrations</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.780" end="01:10:38.110" style="s2">and kind of street violence in Portland</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.000" end="01:10:39.550" style="s2">with antiphon and proud boys and some</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.110" end="01:10:42.460" style="s2">other groups left-wing right-wing groups</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.550" end="01:10:46.360" style="s2">and there have been some rumors about</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.460" end="01:10:47.830" style="s2">people throwing milkshakes mixed with</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.360" end="01:10:51.100" style="s2">concrete that were seriously injuring</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.830" end="01:10:54.130" style="s2">people and James wrote something about</p>

<p begin="01:10:54.130" end="01:10:58.060" style="s2">accounts that this is terrorism that</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.110" end="01:11:01.449" style="s2">merely spreading the rumor is terrorism</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.060" end="01:11:01.960" style="s2">and I am a professor who teaches about</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.449" end="01:11:05.650" style="s2">terror</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.960" end="01:11:09.460" style="s2">book about it and a something that is</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.650" end="01:11:12.070" style="s2">important to me is using the word using</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.460" end="01:11:14.739" style="s2">it in a useful way that I think in many</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.070" end="01:11:16.719" style="s2">ways people have overused the word</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.739" end="01:11:18.520" style="s2">terrorism to just apply it to things</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.719" end="01:11:20.380" style="s2">that they don&#39;t like and that that</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.520" end="01:11:22.570" style="s2">muddies the understanding of the term it</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.380" end="01:11:24.989" style="s2">makes it harder to counter it I mean so</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.570" end="01:11:27.910" style="s2">I wrote something that amounted to</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.989" end="01:11:30.070" style="s2">that&#39;s not terrorism petulant terrorism</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.910" end="01:11:32.080" style="s2">isn&#39;t a thing and you know threats</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.070" end="01:11:34.450" style="s2">aren&#39;t especially like a rumor that</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.080" end="01:11:36.430" style="s2">turns out not to be true by a group you</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.450" end="01:11:37.810" style="s2">don&#39;t like is not terrorism doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.430" end="01:11:41.710" style="s2">it&#39;s good you know that&#39;s not a value</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.810" end="01:11:45.520" style="s2">judgments a classification and his</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.710" end="01:11:50.560" style="s2">response was to be extremely dismissive</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.520" end="01:11:53.620" style="s2">of this and sort of mocking and to then</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.560" end="01:11:55.300" style="s2">go about putting a lot of words in my</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.620" end="01:11:58.210" style="s2">mouth that are basically the opposite of</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.300" end="01:12:00.100" style="s2">what I think about it about how that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.210" end="01:12:02.050" style="s2">saying that US drone strikes or</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.100" end="01:12:03.940" style="s2">terrorism and I wrote a book called</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.050" end="01:12:06.880" style="s2">drones and terrorism in which I say the</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.940" end="01:12:08.830" style="s2">opposite and I&#39;m where and I&#39;m a few</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.880" end="01:12:10.120" style="s2">others like this are just basically this</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.830" end="01:12:13.510" style="s2">sort of the very sort of things I would</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.120" end="01:12:16.150" style="s2">criticize and um and this went back and</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.510" end="01:12:18.460" style="s2">forth for a while and where I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.150" end="01:12:20.800" style="s2">really think anything of it and you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.460" end="01:12:24.340" style="s2">uh Twitter conversations often go that</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.800" end="01:12:27.250" style="s2">way and I had started this one and like</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.340" end="01:12:28.960" style="s2">I said you know I was more I quote</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.250" end="01:12:30.880" style="s2">tweeted him and broadcast it out so my</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.960" end="01:12:32.620" style="s2">father was I didn&#39;t say hi let&#39;s have a</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.880" end="01:12:35.469" style="s2">conversation you know about it I just</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.620" end="01:12:37.300" style="s2">criticized him without him knowing and</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.469" end="01:12:42.300" style="s2">so I didn&#39;t think anything of it until I</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.300" end="01:12:45.040" style="s2">saw a op-ed in the LA Times um by</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.300" end="01:12:47.710" style="s2">Lindsey and because in about I guess</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.040" end="01:12:50.560" style="s2">previewing their book about how you</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.710" end="01:12:53.710" style="s2">should talk to people and I was just</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.560" end="01:12:56.260" style="s2">amazed at the foot spa of it I I kind of</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.710" end="01:12:58.180" style="s2">couldn&#39;t believe that somebody who and</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.260" end="01:13:01.450" style="s2">this could be when things are adjusted</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.180" end="01:13:04.870" style="s2">with me but many people I know have had</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.450" end="01:13:07.989" style="s2">similar Encounters of where Lindsey is</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.870" end="01:13:11.200" style="s2">very rude or dismissive condescending um</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.989" end="01:13:14.770" style="s2">very much not practicing anything that</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.200" end="01:13:15.679" style="s2">was in the op-ed and so I wrote in</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.770" end="01:13:17.079" style="s2">response to that</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.679" end="01:13:19.369" style="s2">I didn&#39;t really think about it a</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.079" end="01:13:21.309" style="s2">conversation originally and I just</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.369" end="01:13:23.780" style="s2">couldn&#39;t believe that somebody who</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.309" end="01:13:27.199" style="s2">practiced the exact opposite of that</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.780" end="01:13:29.119" style="s2">would tell everybody that that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.199" end="01:13:31.039" style="s2">they should behave what&#39;s your sense of</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.119" end="01:13:32.989" style="s2">why that conversation broke down and</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.039" end="01:13:35.959" style="s2">what do you think could could have been</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.989" end="01:13:40.389" style="s2">different I mean the conversation never</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.959" end="01:13:43.849" style="s2">had a chance to break down because I</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.389" end="01:13:45.530" style="s2">because I kind of don&#39;t know what polite</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.849" end="01:13:46.459" style="s2">way to put it because James acted like a</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.530" end="01:13:49.010" style="s2">dick and he acted like a dick</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.459" end="01:13:51.289" style="s2">immediately and I mean really without</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.010" end="01:13:54.039" style="s2">hesitation and then probably the worst</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.289" end="01:13:55.729" style="s2">part about it was as he continued</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.039" end="01:13:57.920" style="s2">mischaracterizing what I believe in</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.729" end="01:13:59.239" style="s2">really just the almost exact opposite of</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.920" end="01:14:01.489" style="s2">things that I&#39;ve written many times I</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.239" end="01:14:03.679" style="s2">mean then when some reader who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.489" end="01:14:06.369" style="s2">following conversation said why aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.679" end="01:14:09.079" style="s2">you responding to any of his points and</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.369" end="01:14:12.079" style="s2">he responded James meaning responded oh</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.079" end="01:14:16.099" style="s2">I muted him awhile ago so the</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.079" end="01:14:17.869" style="s2">combination of um here let me sort of</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.099" end="01:14:19.639" style="s2">mock you and put words in your mouth and</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.869" end="01:14:22.070" style="s2">again mockery on Twitter is you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.639" end="01:14:24.800" style="s2">whatever perfectly I think normal part</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.070" end="01:14:26.389" style="s2">about it and you know people make fun of</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.800" end="01:14:27.889" style="s2">me or criticize me or whatever and I</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.389" end="01:14:31.880" style="s2">think that&#39;s totally that that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.889" end="01:14:35.059" style="s2">part of the medium but the combination</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.880" end="01:14:38.209" style="s2">of misrepresenting me on my particular</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.059" end="01:14:41.630" style="s2">area of expertise no less and then not</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.209" end="01:14:45.469" style="s2">even being willing to listen using a</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.630" end="01:14:47.949" style="s2">feature of the application to make sure</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.469" end="01:14:50.300" style="s2">that he wouldn&#39;t even see my responses</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.949" end="01:14:52.340" style="s2">struck me is basically the worst</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.300" end="01:14:54.860" style="s2">possible way that you could have this</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.340" end="01:14:56.719" style="s2">conversation and also I gotta say if he</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.860" end="01:14:58.189" style="s2">dropped it that would have been totally</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.719" end="01:14:59.510" style="s2">within his rights if he ignored me I</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.189" end="01:15:03.949" style="s2">think that would have been totally fine</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.510" end="01:15:06.289" style="s2">it was the combination of engaging in a</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.949" end="01:15:09.139" style="s2">very dismissive and accurate way mixed</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.289" end="01:15:13.130" style="s2">with the the muting of not even hearing</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.139" end="01:15:15.469" style="s2">the responses and so I was just really</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.130" end="01:15:16.820" style="s2">surprised to see somebody say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.469" end="01:15:17.959" style="s2">really important that you have to have</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.820" end="01:15:19.909" style="s2">these conversations you have to really</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.959" end="01:15:21.349" style="s2">listen to people and you know in my</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.909" end="01:15:23.239" style="s2">article I had a few direct quotes from</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.349" end="01:15:24.499" style="s2">it but how important it was to listen to</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.239" end="01:15:27.110" style="s2">people and try to consider their point</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.499" end="01:15:28.670" style="s2">of view and consider this and where as I</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.110" end="01:15:30.260" style="s2">spoke to a few people about it</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.670" end="01:15:32.660" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.260" end="01:15:35.270" style="s2">interaction was what some of them told</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.660" end="01:15:38.600" style="s2">me a pretty mild version of saying how</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.270" end="01:15:40.220" style="s2">he commonly behaves and it&#39;s nearly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.600" end="01:15:41.570" style="s2">not the worst person on Twitter there</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.220" end="01:15:46.550" style="s2">it&#39;s like some really terrible people on</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.570" end="01:15:48.950" style="s2">the Internet of course but the I think</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.550" end="01:15:50.900" style="s2">very much that you have to in a sense</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.950" end="01:15:52.700" style="s2">practice what you preach if it comes to</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.900" end="01:15:55.180" style="s2">engaging people that you disagree with</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.700" end="01:15:58.640" style="s2">or politely engaging because the</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.180" end="01:16:00.530" style="s2">difficult part about it is not what to</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.640" end="01:16:02.090" style="s2">do I think everybody is capable of</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.530" end="01:16:03.680" style="s2">saying you should listen to other people</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.090" end="01:16:07.430" style="s2">and have polite conversations the</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.680" end="01:16:09.880" style="s2">difficult part is how to do that and you</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.430" end="01:16:13.370" style="s2">know how exactly do you deal with say</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.880" end="01:16:15.550" style="s2">some you know some professor criticizing</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.370" end="01:16:17.630" style="s2">you when as he had you know said was</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.550" end="01:16:20.480" style="s2">emotional because a friend of his had</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.630" end="01:16:23.000" style="s2">been attacked in those demonstrations um</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.480" end="01:16:27.170" style="s2">and how do you in that situation in a</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.000" end="01:16:28.730" style="s2">public forum still act in a way that has</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.170" end="01:16:32.030" style="s2">that sort of difficult conversation</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.730" end="01:16:34.400" style="s2">that&#39;s the hard part and it seems at</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.030" end="01:16:36.560" style="s2">least from my experience and from some</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.400" end="01:16:40.630" style="s2">of those that I&#39;ve talked to that he is</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.560" end="01:16:43.040" style="s2">about as bad at that as anybody and</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.630" end="01:16:46.880" style="s2">therefore it makes me somewhat skeptical</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.040" end="01:16:48.980" style="s2">of the advice that you should do it if</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.880" end="01:16:50.750" style="s2">he is incapable of doing it because what</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.980" end="01:16:53.390" style="s2">people need to know is a lesson of how</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.750" end="01:16:55.640" style="s2">to do it is to be able to see models of</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.390" end="01:16:59.480" style="s2">people who act in a way that they should</p>

<p begin="01:17:46.469" end="01:17:50.399" style="s2">different in so I think bow models that</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.269" end="01:17:53.309" style="s2">behavior change doesn&#39;t and acting</p>

<p begin="01:18:16.320" end="01:18:23.909" style="s2">problem is I don&#39;t give a about the</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.579" end="01:18:25.979" style="s2">topic I don&#39;t care whether milkshakes</p>

<p begin="01:18:25.979" end="01:18:29.849" style="s2">literally could not possibly care less</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.019" end="01:18:31.889" style="s2">about whether that&#39;s the case I made a</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.849" end="01:18:33.959" style="s2">flippant comment about milkshakes being</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.889" end="01:18:37.369" style="s2">terrorist in the wake of a friend of</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.959" end="01:18:39.780" style="s2">mine being pummeled in the street and</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.369" end="01:18:40.860" style="s2">some terrorism expert wants to come in</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.780" end="01:18:42.719" style="s2">and talk about the legal and practical</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.860" end="01:18:43.979" style="s2">matters of terrorism with me because I</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.719" end="01:18:46.499" style="s2">made a couple of tweets about terrorism</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.979" end="01:18:48.689" style="s2">I don&#39;t care that much it&#39;s like I moved</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.499" end="01:18:50.249" style="s2">on if he wants to come and talk to me</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.689" end="01:18:51.899" style="s2">about terrorism he&#39;s gonna be talking</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.249" end="01:18:54.059" style="s2">with a non expert he can show off and</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.899" end="01:18:56.519" style="s2">look intelligent or whatever he can</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.059" end="01:18:59.039" style="s2">school me or we can disagree or I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.519" end="01:19:02.010" style="s2">care it&#39;s fine but the the topic has no</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.039" end="01:19:04.289" style="s2">relevance to me so I also want to ask</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.010" end="01:19:06.269" style="s2">questions about whether whether it does</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.289" end="01:19:07.469" style="s2">matter how we act on Twitter as well</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.269" end="01:19:09.929" style="s2">because that&#39;s another that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.469" end="01:19:12.059" style="s2">topic that he would he would mean he can</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.929" end="01:19:14.610" style="s2">we could we could talk about that too</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.059" end="01:19:16.499" style="s2">and quite comfortable defending that it</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.610" end="01:19:17.699" style="s2">does not really matter how we act on</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.499" end="01:19:21.510" style="s2">Twitter and people who take Twitter</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.699" end="01:19:23.459" style="s2">seriously are doing it wrong well we</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.510" end="01:19:25.409" style="s2">could I mean if it doesn&#39;t work them</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.459" end="01:19:27.570" style="s2">then I just think it&#39;s quite nice to</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.409" end="01:19:28.739" style="s2">have it seems to be the obvious way of</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.570" end="01:19:30.659" style="s2">modeling the thing that we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.739" end="01:19:33.179" style="s2">about the impossible conversations a</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.659" end="01:19:36.269" style="s2">conversation broken down on Twitter that</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.179" end="01:19:37.349" style="s2">could be better on right I just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.269" end="01:19:39.539" style="s2">actually feel like there was a</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.349" end="01:19:41.939" style="s2">conversation had on Twitter at all it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.539" end="01:19:45.030" style="s2">a you know I conceded almost immediately</p>
