<p begin="00:06:41.600" end="00:06:44.240" style="s2">for answering my ayahuasca question last</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.520" end="00:06:45.840" style="s2">week</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.240" end="00:06:47.759" style="s2">you mentioned that humans aren&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.840" end="00:06:49.919" style="s2">only species that expresses gender</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.759" end="00:06:51.360" style="s2">what other species also do it and how</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.919" end="00:06:54.080" style="s2">please</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.360" end="00:06:54.720" style="s2">uh so i thought this just warranted a uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.080" end="00:06:58.080" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.720" end="00:07:00.400" style="s2">quick mention that um</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.080" end="00:07:01.759" style="s2">the way that i&#39;ve been defining gender</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.400" end="00:07:04.960" style="s2">and the way that it fits</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.759" end="00:07:06.080" style="s2">for me uh with all of the manifestations</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.960" end="00:07:08.720" style="s2">that i&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.080" end="00:07:10.639" style="s2">um people use it is that it is</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.720" end="00:07:11.520" style="s2">effectively the behavioral expression of</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.639" end="00:07:13.360" style="s2">sex</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.520" end="00:07:15.759" style="s2">and that in every animal that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.360" end="00:07:16.240" style="s2">non-human and all the non-human animals</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.759" end="00:07:19.360" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.240" end="00:07:19.759" style="s2">that what we call that is sex role and</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.360" end="00:07:22.319" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.759" end="00:07:24.720" style="s2">there are um there are sex roles that</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.319" end="00:07:25.520" style="s2">species from uh you know anemone fish to</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.720" end="00:07:28.400" style="s2">sea horses</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.520" end="00:07:30.960" style="s2">to antelope to elephant seals to</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.400" end="00:07:33.520" style="s2">dolphins and umbrella birds</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.960" end="00:07:34.479" style="s2">um you know have and they are sex</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.520" end="00:07:37.599" style="s2">specific</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.479" end="00:07:38.560" style="s2">uh so um we don&#39;t call it gender in</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.599" end="00:07:41.759" style="s2">other species</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.560" end="00:07:44.160" style="s2">uh but it is it is if it if if gender is</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.759" end="00:07:47.360" style="s2">the behavioral expression of sex</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.160" end="00:07:49.360" style="s2">then then you&#39;re going to have</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.360" end="00:07:50.400" style="s2">you&#39;re going to have that happen anytime</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.360" end="00:07:52.479" style="s2">you&#39;ve got um</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.400" end="00:07:54.879" style="s2">behavior which is certainly all mammals</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.479" end="00:07:56.240" style="s2">and birds and</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.879" end="00:07:57.680" style="s2">probably all vertebrates and a</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.240" end="00:07:58.720" style="s2">tremendous number of inverts as well</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.680" end="00:08:02.160" style="s2">tremendous number of</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.720" end="00:08:03.039" style="s2">insects so i would um i have been</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.160" end="00:08:04.479" style="s2">defining</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.039" end="00:08:07.039" style="s2">gender differently i&#39;ve said it as the</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.479" end="00:08:10.080" style="s2">software of sex in which case</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.039" end="00:08:14.319" style="s2">gender will be found</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.080" end="00:08:17.520" style="s2">in um birds and mammals</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.319" end="00:08:19.599" style="s2">to a substantial degree but but</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.520" end="00:08:22.560" style="s2">differing degrees within those clades</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.599" end="00:08:23.120" style="s2">and not much found outside of them so i</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.560" end="00:08:24.240" style="s2">guess</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.120" end="00:08:26.639" style="s2">there&#39;s a question about which</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.240" end="00:08:26.960" style="s2">definition of gender we&#39;re going with</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.639" end="00:08:28.080" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.960" end="00:08:30.240" style="s2">i think that&#39;s i mean that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.080" end="00:08:32.880" style="s2">interesting because those um</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.240" end="00:08:34.240" style="s2">i like both of those definitions um</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.880" end="00:08:35.680" style="s2">behavioral expression of sex which is</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.240" end="00:08:36.000" style="s2">the one that i&#39;ve been saying for years</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.680" end="00:08:37.760" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.000" end="00:08:39.039" style="s2">have you know written into pieces that</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.760" end="00:08:40.640" style="s2">i&#39;ve written and you&#39;re saying the</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.039" end="00:08:43.360" style="s2">software of sex and they are</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.640" end="00:08:45.040" style="s2">overlapping but not completely and um</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.360" end="00:08:46.240" style="s2">and so they do they do have different</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.040" end="00:08:49.600" style="s2">ramifications</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.240" end="00:08:51.760" style="s2">for how you view say uh the stereotyped</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.600" end="00:08:55.200" style="s2">lordosis behavior of a female</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.760" end="00:08:57.279" style="s2">lizard um uh you know is that is that</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.200" end="00:08:58.880" style="s2">gender or not it would be by my</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.279" end="00:09:02.240" style="s2">definition but not by yours</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.880" end="00:09:03.519" style="s2">um but it but the overlap i think is um</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.240" end="00:09:05.600" style="s2">pretty much perfect when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.519" end="00:09:08.640" style="s2">humans like we have</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.600" end="00:09:09.920" style="s2">no variance so just so people know why</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.640" end="00:09:11.600" style="s2">we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.920" end="00:09:13.519" style="s2">the difference is immense between these</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.600" end="00:09:16.560" style="s2">two definitions because most</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.519" end="00:09:18.480" style="s2">um critters will not have gender because</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.560" end="00:09:22.000" style="s2">most critters don&#39;t meet their parents</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.480" end="00:09:24.720" style="s2">and therefore whatever um sex role</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.000" end="00:09:25.680" style="s2">they have will be programmed in at a</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.720" end="00:09:27.600" style="s2">genetic level</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.680" end="00:09:28.720" style="s2">if behavior is stereotyped um then it</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.600" end="00:09:30.880" style="s2">doesn&#39;t count um</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.720" end="00:09:32.080" style="s2">as gender by your definition right and</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.880" end="00:09:34.000" style="s2">so the</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.080" end="00:09:35.519" style="s2">point about it being you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.000" end="00:09:36.080" style="s2">accept that it is the software of sex</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.519" end="00:09:39.279" style="s2">and the point</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.080" end="00:09:41.360" style="s2">is software is vastly more flexible than</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.279" end="00:09:42.560" style="s2">hardware you know in a lizard that</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.360" end="00:09:45.519" style="s2">doesn&#39;t meet its parents</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.560" end="00:09:46.399" style="s2">and exhibits the stereotyped behaviors</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.519" end="00:09:47.680" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.399" end="00:09:49.120" style="s2">you know there isn&#39;t a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.680" end="00:09:50.959" style="s2">flexibility because in order for the</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.120" end="00:09:52.399" style="s2">creature to be functional that stuff had</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.959" end="00:09:53.760" style="s2">to be written in and the fact that it is</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.399" end="00:09:54.880" style="s2">written in is amazing in so many</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.760" end="00:09:56.800" style="s2">creatures but</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.880" end="00:09:58.720" style="s2">um but the vast majority will have</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.800" end="00:10:01.279" style="s2">nothing that we would call</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.720" end="00:10:03.360" style="s2">um software it&#39;s much more like you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.279" end="00:10:08.959" style="s2">maybe firmware it&#39;s programmed by</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.360" end="00:10:08.959" style="s2">the genes and all but unalterable</p>

<p begin="00:10:35.360" end="00:10:38.079" style="s2">confident that that will also be my</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.040" end="00:10:41.040" style="s2">judgment now we&#39;ve actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.079" end="00:10:42.480" style="s2">we&#39;ve heard um indirectly from a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.040" end="00:10:44.880" style="s2">people now that uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.480" end="00:10:46.320" style="s2">uh that you were wrong uh that the idea</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.880" end="00:10:46.800" style="s2">that this was just sort of a workplace</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.320" end="00:10:48.640" style="s2">drama</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.800" end="00:10:49.839" style="s2">is exactly wrong and actually one of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.640" end="00:10:52.240" style="s2">analyses i saw</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.839" end="00:10:53.680" style="s2">reminded me of um it sounds i know</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.240" end="00:10:55.200" style="s2">nothing about the show i literally know</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.680" end="00:10:56.959" style="s2">nothing about it i&#39;ve never seen one</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.200" end="00:10:59.120" style="s2">um but that it reminded me a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.959" end="00:11:00.800" style="s2">of what um actually bob trivers had told</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.120" end="00:11:02.079" style="s2">us with regard to why when we went to</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.800" end="00:11:02.959" style="s2">grad school we should go to a place of</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.079" end="00:11:04.399" style="s2">museum</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.959" end="00:11:06.000" style="s2">one of the reasons being that when</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.399" end="00:11:08.240" style="s2">you&#39;re at a big</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.000" end="00:11:09.279" style="s2">an important research museum people from</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.240" end="00:11:10.399" style="s2">all over the world with different</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.279" end="00:11:11.760" style="s2">research questions and different</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.399" end="00:11:14.160" style="s2">backgrounds and different biases and</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.760" end="00:11:16.560" style="s2">expectations and hypotheses come through</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.160" end="00:11:18.640" style="s2">and so the idea of a space station</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.560" end="00:11:19.839" style="s2">workplace drama is as a place where all</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.640" end="00:11:22.000" style="s2">the rest of the world comes through when</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.839" end="00:11:24.240" style="s2">you get to interact with them</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.000" end="00:11:25.279" style="s2">strikes me as potentially the reason</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.240" end="00:11:27.360" style="s2">that it could be</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.279" end="00:11:29.360" style="s2">exactly as good as many people including</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.360" end="00:11:30.000" style="s2">holly mathnerd and perhaps ragnar of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.360" end="00:11:32.079" style="s2">desert</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.000" end="00:11:34.480" style="s2">i think it is i don&#39;t think i said that</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.079" end="00:11:34.800" style="s2">deep space nine was a workplace drama i</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.480" end="00:11:38.720" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.800" end="00:11:40.560" style="s2">maybe um maybe the next generation</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.720" end="00:11:42.480" style="s2">is a workplace drama i said that deep</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.560" end="00:11:43.360" style="s2">space nine suffered from nothing ever</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.480" end="00:11:46.079" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.360" end="00:11:48.079" style="s2">oh um but in any case in any case</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.079" end="00:11:51.040" style="s2">apparently things do happen enough that</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.079" end="00:11:51.600" style="s2">people are are captivated by by this</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.040" end="00:11:54.720" style="s2">series</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.600" end="00:11:56.160" style="s2">okay so there it is there it is uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.720" end="00:11:57.519" style="s2">hey both thanks so much for your work</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.160" end="00:11:58.399" style="s2">i&#39;ve been puzzling for a while why there</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.519" end="00:12:00.240" style="s2">are almost zero</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.399" end="00:12:01.440" style="s2">woke debates held anywhere you&#39;d think</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.240" end="00:12:02.000" style="s2">they would want to get their messages</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.440" end="00:12:04.560" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.000" end="00:12:06.160" style="s2">thanks tim they can&#39;t do it though</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.560" end="00:12:09.680" style="s2">they&#39;d be terrible at it</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.160" end="00:12:12.399" style="s2">um yeah they it is inherently</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.680" end="00:12:13.200" style="s2">a terrible position because the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.399" end="00:12:15.519" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.200" end="00:12:17.600" style="s2">maybe debate is the wrong term but uh a</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.519" end="00:12:19.440" style="s2">dialectic is predicated on the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.600" end="00:12:21.519" style="s2">there is some truth to discover and</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.440" end="00:12:23.200" style="s2">wokeness is predicated on the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.519" end="00:12:26.320" style="s2">there isn&#39;t and so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.200" end="00:12:28.639" style="s2">it&#39;s a mismatch um i will</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.320" end="00:12:29.920" style="s2">sooner uh want to engage in sword</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.639" end="00:12:31.040" style="s2">fighting of course they i&#39;m sure they</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.920" end="00:12:33.839" style="s2">can&#39;t do that either</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.040" end="00:12:35.519" style="s2">right um right yes yes no doing things</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.839" end="00:12:37.279" style="s2">is not their strong suit no</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.519" end="00:12:38.959" style="s2">destroying things doing things and</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.279" end="00:12:41.600" style="s2">thinking things both not so much</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.959" end="00:12:42.399" style="s2">right so i will point people again to</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.600" end="00:12:46.000" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.399" end="00:12:50.560" style="s2">um the braver angels podcast with</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.000" end="00:12:53.760" style="s2">john wood jr and um</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.560" end="00:12:54.560" style="s2">bob woodson and i don&#39;t know this is</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.760" end="00:12:56.320" style="s2">duke newsom</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.560" end="00:12:57.839" style="s2">i don&#39;t know i hope i have it right i</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.320" end="00:12:59.200" style="s2">hope i have not embarrassingly pulled a</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.839" end="00:13:01.360" style="s2">name from somewhere else</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.200" end="00:13:03.200" style="s2">i&#39;ve done that before here well i i hope</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.360" end="00:13:04.959" style="s2">i didn&#39;t but in any case</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.200" end="00:13:06.880" style="s2">if you look for bob woodson you will</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.959" end="00:13:10.000" style="s2">find i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.880" end="00:13:13.040" style="s2">duke newsom as the counterpart and</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.000" end="00:13:14.320" style="s2">there is a very good debate between a an</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.040" end="00:13:18.800" style="s2">idw</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.320" end="00:13:21.839" style="s2">style uh person in bob woodson</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.800" end="00:13:25.839" style="s2">and duke on the other side as</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.839" end="00:13:27.839" style="s2">a high up in blm and john wood jr</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.839" end="00:13:29.600" style="s2">as moderator and it does give you a</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.839" end="00:13:30.079" style="s2">sense for how these things go and i must</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.600" end="00:13:33.200" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.079" end="00:13:35.120" style="s2">um it goes about as as you would expect</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.200" end="00:13:37.200" style="s2">well i mean interestingly actually our</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.120" end="00:13:40.000" style="s2">introduction to john wood jr was</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.200" end="00:13:40.320" style="s2">when he moderated a debate um put on by</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.000" end="00:13:43.120" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.320" end="00:13:44.079" style="s2">bridging the divide i think it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.120" end="00:13:47.360" style="s2">organization</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.079" end="00:13:49.600" style="s2">um based here in portland uh between us</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.360" end="00:13:50.560" style="s2">and to people who were representing the</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.600" end="00:13:53.199" style="s2">the woke side</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.560" end="00:13:54.079" style="s2">and um there is audio and poor quality</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.199" end="00:13:56.720" style="s2">video of that</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.079" end="00:13:57.120" style="s2">too um somewhere out there in the world</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.720" end="00:13:58.639" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.120" end="00:14:00.480" style="s2">and i mean john it it was our</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.639" end="00:14:02.399" style="s2">introduction to john he&#39;s extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.480" end="00:14:05.839" style="s2">as a moderator in that sort of situation</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.399" end="00:14:08.160" style="s2">and you know doesn&#39;t let anyone sink but</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.839" end="00:14:09.519" style="s2">lets people think themselves when when</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.160" end="00:14:12.800" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s going to happen</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.519" end="00:14:15.360" style="s2">when that is warranted yes</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.800" end="00:14:16.079" style="s2">all right next question last question</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.360" end="00:14:19.519" style="s2">final question</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.079" end="00:14:21.279" style="s2">from episode 43 a great deal of</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.519" end="00:14:22.720" style="s2">businesses or this is more of a comet</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.279" end="00:14:24.560" style="s2">i think a great deal of businesses here</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.720" end="00:14:25.600" style="s2">in wisconsin seem to be owned and run by</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.560" end="00:14:27.040" style="s2">republicans</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.600" end="00:14:28.320" style="s2">in my experience those of us who are</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.040" end="00:14:29.760" style="s2">left of center have had to tread</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.320" end="00:14:31.680" style="s2">carefully sometimes even fearful of</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.760" end="00:14:33.120" style="s2">repercussions for speaking up</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.680" end="00:14:35.040" style="s2">many of us have to listen to far-right</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.120" end="00:14:36.160" style="s2">libtard type rhetoric by superiors and</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.040" end="00:14:38.399" style="s2">are subject to them making business</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.160" end="00:14:40.079" style="s2">decisions based on their anirand beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.399" end="00:14:41.360" style="s2">it&#39;s intense and impacts us as much as</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.079" end="00:14:42.480" style="s2">those who lament being on the right</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.360" end="00:14:43.199" style="s2">while working at liberally owned</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.480" end="00:14:47.199" style="s2">companies</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.199" end="00:14:50.240" style="s2">right question mark uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.199" end="00:14:52.399" style="s2">yeah yeah i imagine it is so this is um</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.240" end="00:14:54.880" style="s2">i i think this is fascinating actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.399" end="00:14:58.000" style="s2">because um</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.880" end="00:14:59.680" style="s2">we know you know as as liberals who were</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.000" end="00:15:01.360" style="s2">in academia for many years</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.680" end="00:15:03.760" style="s2">um it is well documented that</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.360" end="00:15:06.800" style="s2">anecdotally there is no denying it</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.760" end="00:15:08.639" style="s2">uh that academia is so liberal that to</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.800" end="00:15:09.920" style="s2">be conservative there would be very very</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.639" end="00:15:12.560" style="s2">hard indeed</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.920" end="00:15:13.199" style="s2">uh and um i think the same is true of</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.560" end="00:15:16.399" style="s2">media</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.199" end="00:15:19.600" style="s2">and of hollywood and of many other um</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.399" end="00:15:21.839" style="s2">kinds of organizations as well</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.600" end="00:15:24.000" style="s2">but that small business might well um</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.839" end="00:15:26.800" style="s2">have the opposite bias</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.000" end="00:15:27.920" style="s2">and basically what is being what sharon</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.800" end="00:15:31.440" style="s2">is pointing to here</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.920" end="00:15:34.320" style="s2">is that anytime you&#39;re in a a</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.440" end="00:15:36.000" style="s2">tiny minority uh where the majority is</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.320" end="00:15:37.759" style="s2">so certain of</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.000" end="00:15:39.440" style="s2">the widespread acceptance of its</p>

<p begin="00:17:14.640" end="00:17:19.120" style="s2">are not crazy</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.000" end="00:17:21.360" style="s2">and so in any case um</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.120" end="00:17:23.120" style="s2">i do think that this is a slow battle</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.360" end="00:17:25.839" style="s2">but that what really needs to happen</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.120" end="00:17:26.799" style="s2">is those of us who are part of this uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.839" end="00:17:28.880" style="s2">this old</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.799" end="00:17:30.320" style="s2">intellectual left tradition that still</p>

<p begin="00:17:34.240" end="00:17:39.039" style="s2">that those of us who belong to that need</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.480" end="00:17:39.760" style="s2">to be clear enough about who we are and</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.039" end="00:17:42.799" style="s2">why we</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.760" end="00:17:44.000" style="s2">are there that it does begin to dawn on</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.799" end="00:17:46.880" style="s2">all of those who have been</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.000" end="00:17:48.640" style="s2">dismissing the left you know with this</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.880" end="00:17:51.120" style="s2">mind-numbing libtard</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.640" end="00:17:52.240" style="s2">uh rhetoric um that they are they become</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.120" end="00:17:54.160" style="s2">aware</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.240" end="00:17:55.520" style="s2">that it actually it is not so simple and</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.160" end="00:17:59.280" style="s2">you know many people</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.520" end="00:18:01.919" style="s2">ben shapiro greg gutfeld tucker carlson</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.280" end="00:18:04.720" style="s2">all of these folks have registered that</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.919" end="00:18:06.480" style="s2">actually there&#39;s a necessity of the left</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.720" end="00:18:08.240" style="s2">and what i&#39;m hoping ultimately and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.480" end="00:18:11.200" style="s2">not totally absent</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.240" end="00:18:13.200" style="s2">right the the vestiges are there um it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.200" end="00:18:15.280" style="s2">just being drowned out by something</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.200" end="00:18:17.039" style="s2">that isn&#39;t left at all it&#39;s quite a</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.280" end="00:18:19.280" style="s2">liberal</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.039" end="00:18:20.160" style="s2">but ultimately we need to have a</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.280" end="00:18:23.360" style="s2">discussion</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.160" end="00:18:26.640" style="s2">about what the left got</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.360" end="00:18:27.520" style="s2">right what the right got right and how</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.640" end="00:18:30.559" style="s2">we are now</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.520" end="00:18:32.080" style="s2">living the benefits of the tension</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.559" end="00:18:34.160" style="s2">between these two things</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.080" end="00:18:35.840" style="s2">um and frankly i think people will be</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.160" end="00:18:38.799" style="s2">surprised if they do</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.840" end="00:18:40.240" style="s2">an honest accounting of just how much</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.799" end="00:18:41.520" style="s2">the left has been correct about</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.240" end="00:18:43.360" style="s2">historically speaking</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.520" end="00:18:44.559" style="s2">now one of one of the things in what you</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.360" end="00:18:47.679" style="s2">said that&#39;s so important</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.559" end="00:18:49.600" style="s2">is the idea of tension that um one of</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.679" end="00:18:51.919" style="s2">the many reasons that utopia is</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.600" end="00:18:52.720" style="s2">a a dangerous fiction and can never</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.919" end="00:18:55.360" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.720" end="00:18:56.559" style="s2">is that any versions of utopia i&#39;ve ever</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.360" end="00:18:58.080" style="s2">heard of</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.559" end="00:18:59.679" style="s2">imagine a life without strife for life</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.080" end="00:19:02.000" style="s2">without tension and</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.679" end="00:19:02.880" style="s2">tension is the thing that both provides</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.000" end="00:19:06.640" style="s2">meaning</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.880" end="00:19:09.039" style="s2">and a force to strive against and</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.640" end="00:19:10.720" style="s2">and allows things from descending into</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.039" end="00:19:12.480" style="s2">total chaos on either side of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.720" end="00:19:15.039" style="s2">spectrum and that&#39;s what we&#39;re seeing as</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.480" end="00:19:16.400" style="s2">the you know for instance as the</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.039" end="00:19:19.039" style="s2">the protests on the street are allowed</p>

<p begin="00:19:20.160" end="00:19:25.039" style="s2">from the would-be leadership it&#39;s just</p>

<p begin="00:22:26.960" end="00:22:31.600" style="s2">somewhat harmful</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.480" end="00:22:32.720" style="s2">um efforts to make police reforms 32</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.600" end="00:22:37.360" style="s2">percent very</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.720" end="00:22:40.640" style="s2">17 somewhat so a lot of skepticism about</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.360" end="00:22:43.440" style="s2">these protests keep going uh here we go</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.640" end="00:22:44.159" style="s2">are the protests violent right of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.440" end="00:22:47.679" style="s2">choice</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.159" end="00:22:49.679" style="s2">yeah um 56 percent of people think</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.679" end="00:22:51.679" style="s2">they&#39;re mostly violent</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.679" end="00:22:53.280" style="s2">which i would agree they are if they</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.679" end="00:22:54.400" style="s2">reliably turn to violence they are</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.280" end="00:22:55.840" style="s2">mostly violent</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.400" end="00:22:57.280" style="s2">it really i mean this is going to sound</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.840" end="00:22:59.039" style="s2">clintonian but it kind of depends on</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.280" end="00:23:01.120" style="s2">what your definition of mostly is</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.039" end="00:23:02.720" style="s2">as you know has all of these things</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.120" end="00:23:04.880" style="s2">right i agree but if</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.720" end="00:23:05.919" style="s2">you&#39;re if you&#39;re doing a kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.880" end="00:23:08.080" style="s2">ethogram</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.919" end="00:23:09.120" style="s2">and you know every 30 seconds looking</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.080" end="00:23:10.720" style="s2">and going like i&#39;m going to record</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.120" end="00:23:12.320" style="s2">violent or not not violent okay the next</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.720" end="00:23:14.000" style="s2">30 seconds violent are not not violent</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.320" end="00:23:15.520" style="s2">but then you get then you get garbage</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.000" end="00:23:18.320" style="s2">then you get the 93</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.520" end="00:23:18.799" style="s2">peaceful 93 peaceful so what does mostly</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.320" end="00:23:20.320" style="s2">violent</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.799" end="00:23:22.000" style="s2">mean you know but if you take it by day</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.320" end="00:23:23.280" style="s2">it depends on your your interval of</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.000" end="00:23:24.880" style="s2">recording right like</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.280" end="00:23:26.960" style="s2">how many days of protest have been</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.880" end="00:23:27.360" style="s2">violent oh mostly violent actually but</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.960" end="00:23:29.600" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.360" end="00:23:31.360" style="s2">this is a test of something different so</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.600" end="00:23:32.720" style="s2">i agree you can define these things and</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.360" end="00:23:33.039" style="s2">you can get any answer you want but</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.720" end="00:23:34.640" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.039" end="00:23:36.480" style="s2">part of the point is that that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.640" end="00:23:39.360" style="s2">what&#39;s been done to us and when you ask</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.480" end="00:23:42.080" style="s2">people you know common parlance is this</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.360" end="00:23:44.159" style="s2">mostly peaceful or mostly violent 56</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.080" end="00:23:45.760" style="s2">of it say mostly violent by whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.159" end="00:23:46.480" style="s2">intuitive definition of this is and i</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.760" end="00:23:50.240" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.480" end="00:23:51.600" style="s2">they&#39;re absolutely right so um anyway</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.240" end="00:23:53.279" style="s2">we don&#39;t need to go all the way through</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.600" end="00:23:54.320" style="s2">this report and um</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.279" end="00:23:56.640" style="s2">we should probably get back to the</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.320" end="00:23:58.960" style="s2">questions yeah so let&#39;s let&#39;s do that</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.640" end="00:23:58.960" style="s2">oops</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.039" end="00:24:03.760" style="s2">um okay next question from the discord</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.480" end="00:24:05.279" style="s2">server and then we will get to the</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.760" end="00:24:07.120" style="s2">questions from today</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.279" end="00:24:08.400" style="s2">you&#39;ve discussed historical examples of</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.120" end="00:24:10.480" style="s2">fascism and communism</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.400" end="00:24:11.919" style="s2">maoist china the soviet union nazi</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.480" end="00:24:14.720" style="s2">germany venezuela</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.919" end="00:24:16.480" style="s2">chile etc are there historical examples</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.720" end="00:24:18.080" style="s2">where the madness was defeated before it</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.480" end="00:24:20.559" style="s2">became catastrophic</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.080" end="00:24:24.080" style="s2">from these what lessons can we learn and</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.559" end="00:24:24.080" style="s2">apply to our current circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.720" end="00:24:30.400" style="s2">um it&#39;s this is a very hard question</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.799" end="00:24:32.000" style="s2">to answer they knew this was going to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.400" end="00:24:33.440" style="s2">hard apparently douglas mario was</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.000" end="00:24:35.039" style="s2">asked this question recently on</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.440" end="00:24:36.640" style="s2">trigonometry and</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.039" end="00:24:38.159" style="s2">yeah also had a hard time with it i</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.640" end="00:24:41.360" style="s2">think i think the reason that it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.159" end="00:24:44.559" style="s2">is that if something avoids being</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.360" end="00:24:45.360" style="s2">what um one fears that it is going to</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.559" end="00:24:47.600" style="s2">turn into</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.360" end="00:24:49.200" style="s2">then there&#39;s no way to distinguish</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.600" end="00:24:50.880" style="s2">between whether it was never headed to</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.200" end="00:24:51.760" style="s2">be that and people were catastrophizing</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.880" end="00:24:53.039" style="s2">over nothing or whether they</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.760" end="00:24:56.960" style="s2">successfully</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.039" end="00:24:58.480" style="s2">um beat back the danger the history</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.960" end="00:25:00.000" style="s2">it will be hard to write the history</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.480" end="00:25:03.360" style="s2">that says we beat this thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.000" end="00:25:04.880" style="s2">before it got bad yeah and there will be</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.360" end="00:25:06.240" style="s2">at least as many histories written that</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.880" end="00:25:07.360" style="s2">say it wasn&#39;t the thing they thought it</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.240" end="00:25:09.279" style="s2">was going to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.360" end="00:25:11.120" style="s2">yeah and you know there&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.279" end="00:25:13.679" style="s2">possibility in some cases</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.120" end="00:25:14.720" style="s2">that something that was headed to some</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.679" end="00:25:16.080" style="s2">place very bad</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.720" end="00:25:18.159" style="s2">went somewhere bad but it could have</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.080" end="00:25:19.039" style="s2">been way worse and so how do you rank</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.159" end="00:25:21.360" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.039" end="00:25:22.960" style="s2">um so i i don&#39;t know i don&#39;t i mean just</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.360" end="00:25:24.240" style="s2">in terms of the actual question i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.960" end="00:25:27.120" style="s2">i don&#39;t know enough history</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.240" end="00:25:28.640" style="s2">to come up with um things that might</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.120" end="00:25:29.360" style="s2">might look like what we&#39;re describing</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.640" end="00:25:30.960" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.360" end="00:25:34.080" style="s2">uh but i imagine that there would be</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.960" end="00:25:35.840" style="s2">lessons to be learned yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.080" end="00:25:38.960" style="s2">it&#39;s a great question yeah how the</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.840" end="00:25:43.360" style="s2">methodology is the tough part</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.960" end="00:25:45.120" style="s2">okay religions and secular faiths uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.360" end="00:25:47.120" style="s2">such as social justice are</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.120" end="00:25:47.919" style="s2">sub-categories of one socio-cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.120" end="00:25:51.200" style="s2">phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.919" end="00:25:52.799" style="s2">narrative dog was dogmas united group</p>

<p begin="00:25:52.799" end="00:25:56.880" style="s2">excuse me dogma&#39;s united group against</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.880" end="00:25:58.559" style="s2">others with shared epistemology morality</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.880" end="00:26:00.960" style="s2">and central narrative</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.559" end="00:26:00.960" style="s2">thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.279" end="00:26:07.120" style="s2">some categories of socio-cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.760" end="00:26:10.400" style="s2">phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.120" end="00:26:12.480" style="s2">dogmas united group um</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.400" end="00:26:13.520" style="s2">yeah i mean i think loosely speaking</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.480" end="00:26:16.720" style="s2">that&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.520" end="00:26:17.919" style="s2">right and you know it&#39;s true um</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.720" end="00:26:19.440" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure so i guess i wondered</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.919" end="00:26:21.200" style="s2">dogma&#39;s united group against others who</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.440" end="00:26:22.320" style="s2">shared epistemology morality and central</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.200" end="00:26:25.039" style="s2">narrative</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.320" end="00:26:25.760" style="s2">i wonder that might be the the three</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.039" end="00:26:28.000" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.760" end="00:26:29.520" style="s2">that are actually defining um i&#39;d want</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.000" end="00:26:30.880" style="s2">to think more about whether or not you</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.520" end="00:26:32.000" style="s2">could simplify those or does that</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.880" end="00:26:35.200" style="s2">collapse to</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.000" end="00:26:38.240" style="s2">one or two uh variables or is</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.200" end="00:26:41.600" style="s2">are there more things um that</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.240" end="00:26:42.960" style="s2">define what a dogma is that are not on</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.600" end="00:26:44.320" style="s2">that list i&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.960" end="00:26:45.840" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m not sure if either thing is</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.320" end="00:26:46.880" style="s2">missing or if it can be simplified and</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.840" end="00:26:50.000" style="s2">it may also be</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.880" end="00:26:52.799" style="s2">in some sense um</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.000" end="00:26:54.960" style="s2">overdrawn because we see the same</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.799" end="00:26:57.679" style="s2">phenomenon inside of scientific</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.960" end="00:26:59.440" style="s2">disciplines right a particular school of</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.679" end="00:27:02.080" style="s2">thought will take over</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.440" end="00:27:03.679" style="s2">um and it&#39;s not entirely clear to me</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.080" end="00:27:05.760" style="s2">that it doesn&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.679" end="00:27:06.720" style="s2">share morality with the schools of</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.760" end="00:27:09.679" style="s2">thought that are</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.720" end="00:27:10.640" style="s2">driven out that it just wins temporarily</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.679" end="00:27:12.720" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.640" end="00:27:13.679" style="s2">uh some game over publications or</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.720" end="00:27:16.080" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.679" end="00:27:17.360" style="s2">um well but maybe i mean the argument</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.080" end="00:27:21.600" style="s2">then i think would be that that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.360" end="00:27:22.960" style="s2">it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.600" end="00:27:24.559" style="s2">no no it&#39;s actually you&#39;re right i was</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.960" end="00:27:25.120" style="s2">going to say that&#39;s not a secular faith</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.559" end="00:27:27.679" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.120" end="00:27:28.480" style="s2">this person is defining a dogma as a</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.679" end="00:27:30.640" style="s2">bigger group</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.480" end="00:27:32.399" style="s2">than in relations and secular faiths</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.640" end="00:27:35.440" style="s2">that&#39;s those are subcategories</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.399" end="00:27:37.279" style="s2">yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.440" end="00:27:38.640" style="s2">um no i actually i think you&#39;re right i</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.279" end="00:27:41.679" style="s2">think morality at least</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.640" end="00:27:42.159" style="s2">um is a sometimes uh variable but not</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.679" end="00:27:43.760" style="s2">always</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.159" end="00:27:45.679" style="s2">and definitely one dog i guess another</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.760" end="00:27:47.039" style="s2">although it&#39;s possible based on the</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.679" end="00:27:48.880" style="s2">way the question is written that the</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.039" end="00:27:50.320" style="s2">moralities don&#39;t have to differ right</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.880" end="00:27:54.080" style="s2">you can be united</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.320" end="00:27:55.120" style="s2">with your um your fellows in a doctor it</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.080" end="00:27:56.559" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have to be the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.120" end="00:27:57.360" style="s2">defines you against others it just has</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.559" end="00:28:00.840" style="s2">to be the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.360" end="00:28:04.480" style="s2">helps you define you know in group yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.840" end="00:28:06.799" style="s2">yeah okay next question accepting that</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.480" end="00:28:09.279" style="s2">the plural of anecdote isn&#39;t data</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.799" end="00:28:10.799" style="s2">what role can or may anecdotes play if</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.279" end="00:28:12.480" style="s2">any in analysis</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.799" end="00:28:14.240" style="s2">particularly repeated and or highly</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.480" end="00:28:15.600" style="s2">translatable anecdotes or analyzing</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.240" end="00:28:16.799" style="s2">qualitative rather than quantitative</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.600" end="00:28:18.159" style="s2">circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.799" end="00:28:19.360" style="s2">i wanted to pull something up actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.159" end="00:28:22.080" style="s2">if you want to riff from it i want to</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.360" end="00:28:25.279" style="s2">pull something up sure</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.080" end="00:28:28.320" style="s2">the the sense</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.279" end="00:28:31.120" style="s2">of the danger of anecdotes is</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.320" end="00:28:32.480" style="s2">way overdrawn and in some sense it is</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.120" end="00:28:34.640" style="s2">designed</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.480" end="00:28:35.600" style="s2">by the same people who are constantly</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.640" end="00:28:38.080" style="s2">wielding</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.600" end="00:28:39.440" style="s2">you know the data is king what do the</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.080" end="00:28:42.240" style="s2">data say</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.440" end="00:28:44.080" style="s2">um data-driven research these sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.240" end="00:28:45.279" style="s2">things which sound right you know it</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.080" end="00:28:48.559" style="s2">sounds sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.279" end="00:28:50.080" style="s2">to be skeptical of anecdotes and it is</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.559" end="00:28:51.600" style="s2">it sounds very sophisticated to say that</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.080" end="00:28:54.000" style="s2">the multiple</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.600" end="00:28:55.200" style="s2">of anecdote is not data on the other</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.000" end="00:28:57.360" style="s2">hand</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.200" end="00:28:58.559" style="s2">first of all in a complex system when</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.360" end="00:29:00.880" style="s2">you do observation</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.559" end="00:29:03.039" style="s2">you are observing anecdotes that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.880" end="00:29:03.760" style="s2">you get to a hypothesis that&#39;s worthy of</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.039" end="00:29:06.960" style="s2">test</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.760" end="00:29:06.960" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.840" end="00:29:12.159" style="s2">let&#39;s just say if anecdote exists in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.799" end="00:29:13.840" style="s2">observational phase</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.159" end="00:29:15.679" style="s2">of scientific research it&#39;s perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.840" end="00:29:17.520" style="s2">legitimate and</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.679" end="00:29:19.360" style="s2">it just simply travels by a different</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.520" end="00:29:22.240" style="s2">name</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.360" end="00:29:24.240" style="s2">so in any case there are certain things</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.240" end="00:29:26.960" style="s2">that are deployed to keep</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.240" end="00:29:27.600" style="s2">a powerful group powerful and this is</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.960" end="00:29:31.919" style="s2">one of them</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.600" end="00:29:33.919" style="s2">so i would say correlation implies</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.919" end="00:29:35.840" style="s2">causation when it&#39;s preceded by a</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.919" end="00:29:39.279" style="s2">properly predictive hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.840" end="00:29:42.000" style="s2">despite what you&#39;ve been told and</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.279" end="00:29:43.919" style="s2">anecdote is a very important source of</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.000" end="00:29:44.799" style="s2">information about a system it is not in</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.919" end="00:29:48.080" style="s2">and of itself</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.799" end="00:29:51.120" style="s2">a test of a hypothesis yep</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.080" end="00:29:54.000" style="s2">though it can be used as a spot check</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.120" end="00:29:54.720" style="s2">right you can have a hypothesis for some</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.000" end="00:29:56.320" style="s2">reason</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.720" end="00:29:57.919" style="s2">and then you can check it against the</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.320" end="00:29:59.360" style="s2">anecdotes in your head and say</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.919" end="00:30:01.120" style="s2">actually i don&#39;t believe that hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.360" end="00:30:02.559" style="s2">because i know six instances in which</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.120" end="00:30:04.000" style="s2">they would have gone a different way</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.559" end="00:30:06.880" style="s2">each of which were anecdotes</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.000" end="00:30:08.000" style="s2">you can falsify with anecdote um so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.880" end="00:30:12.480" style="s2">what i wanted to say i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.000" end="00:30:14.720" style="s2">find the actual uh paper but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.480" end="00:30:15.919" style="s2">reading that i used to give um from</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.720" end="00:30:17.520" style="s2">barbara smutz</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.919" end="00:30:19.840" style="s2">who&#39;s uh who was on my doctoral</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.520" end="00:30:22.320" style="s2">committee and one of the important</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.840" end="00:30:23.200" style="s2">researchers in baboon behavior and</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.320" end="00:30:26.559" style="s2">specifically</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.200" end="00:30:28.880" style="s2">who focused on female baboon behavior</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.559" end="00:30:29.840" style="s2">and in her book sex and friendship and</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.880" end="00:30:33.360" style="s2">baboons</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.840" end="00:30:35.360" style="s2">she wrote a bit about basically</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.360" end="00:30:36.640" style="s2">the the kinds of data that you take in</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.360" end="00:30:38.320" style="s2">the field and so i just went looking</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.640" end="00:30:39.679" style="s2">into my methodology behavioral</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.320" end="00:30:41.039" style="s2">methodology lectures that i would give</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.679" end="00:30:41.520" style="s2">to students before i sent them out to</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.039" end="00:30:43.200" style="s2">try to</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.520" end="00:30:44.559" style="s2">start to become animal behaviorists i</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.200" end="00:30:48.840" style="s2">don&#39;t find it there but</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.559" end="00:30:51.279" style="s2">um there she has a sort of a taxonomy</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.840" end="00:30:52.880" style="s2">of of course the kind of thing that you</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.279" end="00:30:53.760" style="s2">can see over and over again between</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.880" end="00:30:55.440" style="s2">individuals</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.760" end="00:30:56.960" style="s2">and also keep track of the context in</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.440" end="00:30:58.640" style="s2">which you saw them are the things that</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.960" end="00:31:01.600" style="s2">we look for when we are going to</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.640" end="00:31:03.679" style="s2">apply statistical analysis to the data</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.600" end="00:31:05.039" style="s2">but there are two other categories of</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.679" end="00:31:06.640" style="s2">things and i don&#39;t i just don&#39;t have it</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.039" end="00:31:10.159" style="s2">in my head and i can&#39;t pull it up here</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.640" end="00:31:12.399" style="s2">um some of which happen occasionally</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.159" end="00:31:13.600" style="s2">but under such dissimilar circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.399" end="00:31:14.320" style="s2">that you couldn&#39;t that even though you</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.600" end="00:31:15.679" style="s2">might have 10</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.320" end="00:31:16.880" style="s2">instances you still can&#39;t apply</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.679" end="00:31:18.000" style="s2">statistics to them because you know that</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.880" end="00:31:20.559" style="s2">they&#39;re the same but they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.000" end="00:31:22.399" style="s2">the same enough and then some of which</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.559" end="00:31:24.559" style="s2">you may actually just see once or twice</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.399" end="00:31:26.480" style="s2">and so there is no expectation</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.559" end="00:31:28.240" style="s2">that you would actually um be able to</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.480" end="00:31:28.799" style="s2">apply statistics and therefore you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.240" end="00:31:30.880" style="s2">you can</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.799" end="00:31:32.480" style="s2">and if you can&#39;t apply statistics we</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.880" end="00:31:35.200" style="s2">basically don&#39;t call it</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.480" end="00:31:37.039" style="s2">data except that and you know if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.200" end="00:31:38.000" style="s2">only one offer too often we tend to call</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.039" end="00:31:40.480" style="s2">it anecdote</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.000" end="00:31:42.159" style="s2">but over in um trying to understand</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.480" end="00:31:42.720" style="s2">behavior land over in animal behavior</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.159" end="00:31:44.399" style="s2">land</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.720" end="00:31:45.760" style="s2">the rarest things are often the most</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.399" end="00:31:46.399" style="s2">explanatory and certainly the most</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.760" end="00:31:48.480" style="s2">exciting</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.399" end="00:31:50.240" style="s2">so you know we know that chimps</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.480" end="00:31:53.039" style="s2">sometimes wage war on one another</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.240" end="00:31:54.960" style="s2">because jane goodall saw it happen once</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.039" end="00:31:58.080" style="s2">over an extended period of days but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.960" end="00:31:59.919" style="s2">one i think it was a</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.080" end="00:32:01.840" style="s2">i think it was a fissioning group um</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.919" end="00:32:03.440" style="s2">that then drew a line</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.840" end="00:32:05.519" style="s2">in the sand effectively and fighted with</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.440" end="00:32:06.960" style="s2">one another fighted fight it</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.519" end="00:32:08.640" style="s2">and then and then fought with one</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.960" end="00:32:11.440" style="s2">another um and</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.640" end="00:32:13.120" style="s2">similarly you will find um you know just</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.440" end="00:32:14.880" style="s2">other kinds of territorial takeovers or</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.120" end="00:32:17.679" style="s2">sexual takeovers or</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.880" end="00:32:19.120" style="s2">um either between groups or the</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.679" end="00:32:22.559" style="s2">replacement of an alpha</p>

<p begin="00:32:40.720" end="00:32:44.799" style="s2">and no we can&#39;t plug it into stats but</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.720" end="00:32:47.440" style="s2">um it will be the thing that informs</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.799" end="00:32:47.919" style="s2">our understanding maybe more than and</p>

<p begin="00:33:01.679" end="00:33:06.080" style="s2">um but you know it used to be that</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.159" end="00:33:08.399" style="s2">natural history</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.080" end="00:33:09.919" style="s2">was understood to be a scientifically</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.399" end="00:33:11.360" style="s2">valid pursuit and in fact a very</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.919" end="00:33:15.279" style="s2">important one</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.360" end="00:33:18.399" style="s2">and the fact is the you know the uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.279" end="00:33:20.720" style="s2">data-driven science people have among</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.399" end="00:33:22.240" style="s2">other things they&#39;ve driven out theory</p>

<p begin="00:33:22.240" end="00:33:26.480" style="s2">um natural history so it used to be you</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.279" end="00:33:29.440" style="s2">saw something</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.480" end="00:33:31.440" style="s2">remarkable like i once saw what i</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.440" end="00:33:33.279" style="s2">believed to be a woodpecker riding on</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.440" end="00:33:36.960" style="s2">the back of a crow</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.279" end="00:33:40.000" style="s2">what it was amazing where uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.960" end="00:33:41.279" style="s2">in a deep lake in uh in sun lakes in</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.000" end="00:33:44.720" style="s2">eastern washington</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.279" end="00:33:44.720" style="s2">um but in any case</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.799" end="00:33:50.480" style="s2">i also saw a moose there right</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.840" end="00:33:51.840" style="s2">in in the desert right so here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.480" end="00:33:53.200" style="s2">thing there used to be a thing called a</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.840" end="00:33:54.880" style="s2">natural history note</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.200" end="00:33:56.880" style="s2">where you saw something it was</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.880" end="00:33:58.559" style="s2">unmistakable what you saw and you</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.880" end="00:34:00.080" style="s2">documented as much about</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.559" end="00:34:01.600" style="s2">what it was that you saw and then you</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.080" end="00:34:02.960" style="s2">just simply reported it so that</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.600" end="00:34:04.480" style="s2">everybody would have the benefit of</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.960" end="00:34:06.000" style="s2">effectively having seen the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.480" end="00:34:07.279" style="s2">well actually i published one of these i</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.000" end="00:34:10.240" style="s2">published one of these</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.279" end="00:34:11.679" style="s2">um with regard to let&#39;s see i could have</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.240" end="00:34:14.480" style="s2">done two which one did i publish</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.679" end="00:34:15.760" style="s2">ah with regard to my frogs in madagascar</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.480" end="00:34:17.440" style="s2">at one point i&#39;m sitting there watching</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.760" end="00:34:18.960" style="s2">this marked population of</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.440" end="00:34:21.280" style="s2">i&#39;ve tattooed them so i know who all the</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.960" end="00:34:22.079" style="s2">individuals are and i&#39;ve got a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.280" end="00:34:24.480" style="s2">fights going on</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.079" end="00:34:25.520" style="s2">with the very active fascinating little</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.480" end="00:34:27.599" style="s2">poisonous frogs</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.520" end="00:34:28.879" style="s2">um and up from the leaf later comes a</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.599" end="00:34:31.119" style="s2">boa and</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.879" end="00:34:32.399" style="s2">uh grabs one of the female frogs i knew</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.119" end="00:34:33.200" style="s2">i knew the frog so i know this is a</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.399" end="00:34:36.560" style="s2">female</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.200" end="00:34:38.079" style="s2">and all all the talking in the landscape</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.560" end="00:34:39.599" style="s2">stops all the males stop talking and</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.079" end="00:34:40.399" style="s2">they all kind of everyone kind of slinks</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.599" end="00:34:43.679" style="s2">off</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.399" end="00:34:47.679" style="s2">and this boa kind of chews on the frog</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.679" end="00:34:49.280" style="s2">for 10-15 minutes spits it out</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.679" end="00:34:50.879" style="s2">this frog then goes on to become a</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.280" end="00:34:52.399" style="s2">mother because i&#39;m tracking her she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.879" end="00:34:55.359" style="s2">tattooed i know i</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.399" end="00:34:55.919" style="s2">see her engage in courtship and lay an</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.359" end="00:34:58.320" style="s2">egg and</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.919" end="00:34:59.040" style="s2">feeds her tadpoles and she she she ends</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.320" end="00:35:01.839" style="s2">up fine</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.040" end="00:35:02.560" style="s2">and this boa is no longer around after</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.839" end="00:35:04.480" style="s2">that day</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.560" end="00:35:06.640" style="s2">learn its lesson but that&#39;s one time</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.480" end="00:35:08.480" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s one time i&#39;ve got one</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.640" end="00:35:10.000" style="s2">anecdotes fascinating but it is actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.480" end="00:35:11.680" style="s2">a natural history note and i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.000" end="00:35:12.480" style="s2">herpetological journal of herpetology</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.680" end="00:35:14.480" style="s2">something yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.480" end="00:35:16.160" style="s2">um so these things do still exist but</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.480" end="00:35:18.320" style="s2">they&#39;re and they&#39;re rarer</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.160" end="00:35:20.079" style="s2">and they&#39;re not looked at with the same</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.320" end="00:35:23.359" style="s2">kind of reverence that</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.079" end="00:35:25.280" style="s2">um a database paper is but</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.359" end="00:35:26.960" style="s2">from the point of view of actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.280" end="00:35:28.560" style="s2">understanding nature</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.960" end="00:35:30.480" style="s2">man give me a natural historian who</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.560" end="00:35:32.400" style="s2">knows what they&#39;re doing any day right</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.480" end="00:35:33.599" style="s2">these these people have understood</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.400" end="00:35:36.240" style="s2">something deep and</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.599" end="00:35:38.160" style="s2">um oh it&#39;s dan jansen the famous</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.240" end="00:35:41.520" style="s2">tropical biologist</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.160" end="00:35:42.160" style="s2">who once said um a biologist dies with</p>

<p begin="00:35:45.599" end="00:35:50.720" style="s2">and this is unfortunate because in some</p>

<p begin="00:35:50.720" end="00:35:54.960" style="s2">or a naturalist accumulates over a</p>

<p begin="00:35:54.960" end="00:35:58.720" style="s2">very valuable stuff and it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.040" end="00:36:00.400" style="s2">impossible to record all of the things</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.720" end="00:36:01.680" style="s2">that you&#39;ve come to understand by all of</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.400" end="00:36:05.280" style="s2">the anecdotes you&#39;ve encountered</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.680" end="00:36:05.280" style="s2">absolutely i mean it&#39;s actually part of</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.920" end="00:36:08.960" style="s2">probably a small part but part of why</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.839" end="00:36:11.040" style="s2">you and i find this</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.960" end="00:36:12.400" style="s2">situation that&#39;s going on outside right</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.040" end="00:36:15.680" style="s2">now so troubling</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.400" end="00:36:18.079" style="s2">that um we both uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.680" end="00:36:20.480" style="s2">create sense of our world by going out</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.079" end="00:36:21.440" style="s2">into it and reflecting on the changing</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.480" end="00:36:23.680" style="s2">of the seasons</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.440" end="00:36:24.880" style="s2">and the plants and the birds and and you</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.680" end="00:36:26.400" style="s2">know everything that&#39;s happening just in</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.880" end="00:36:29.520" style="s2">our immediate vicinity</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.400" end="00:36:31.040" style="s2">and being really unable to spend more</p>

<p begin="00:36:42.960" end="00:36:47.119" style="s2">us or what we&#39;ve created right here is</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.280" end="00:36:49.599" style="s2">uh incredibly restricting</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.119" end="00:36:51.839" style="s2">yeah it is it&#39;s turned us it&#39;s turned</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.599" end="00:36:53.359" style="s2">our world into an all social one which</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.839" end="00:36:54.960" style="s2">is something we seek to avoid most of</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.359" end="00:36:56.079" style="s2">the time not that we avoid all social</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.960" end="00:36:57.760" style="s2">stuff but we avoid because we don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.079" end="00:37:01.200" style="s2">each other very much</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.760" end="00:37:03.119" style="s2">now we avoid the complete socialness of</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.200" end="00:37:04.800" style="s2">the world and um anyway it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.119" end="00:37:09.359" style="s2">enforced by stock</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.800" end="00:37:10.720" style="s2">yep all right um</p>

<p begin="00:37:42.400" end="00:37:47.440" style="s2">more um</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.839" end="00:37:50.960" style="s2">more formal critique like i did for um</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.440" end="00:37:51.680" style="s2">deangelo&#39;s white fragility but the main</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.960" end="00:37:54.160" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.680" end="00:37:55.359" style="s2">i guess is that he sets up a false</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.160" end="00:37:58.480" style="s2">dichotomy</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.359" end="00:38:01.599" style="s2">he um coins a term anti-racist</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.480" end="00:38:04.880" style="s2">he defines it to mean</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.599" end="00:38:06.720" style="s2">those who seek equality of outcome and</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.880" end="00:38:08.720" style="s2">he then redefines racist to mean</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.720" end="00:38:09.520" style="s2">anything that&#39;s not anti-racist which</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.720" end="00:38:11.599" style="s2">means</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.520" end="00:38:13.760" style="s2">you are racist in his worldview if you</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.599" end="00:38:17.200" style="s2">do not seek equality of outcome</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.760" end="00:38:19.760" style="s2">and equality of outcome is um you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.200" end="00:38:20.720" style="s2">broadly understood at least it was until</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.760" end="00:38:24.160" style="s2">yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.720" end="00:38:27.040" style="s2">academically speaking uh to be a goal</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.160" end="00:38:27.920" style="s2">that is neither honorable uh nor liberal</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.040" end="00:38:31.359" style="s2">nor</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.920" end="00:38:32.000" style="s2">obtainable so um he&#39;s setting us up for</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.359" end="00:38:35.200" style="s2">failure</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.000" end="00:38:37.359" style="s2">and um you know what what i&#39;ve said is</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.200" end="00:38:39.680" style="s2">i&#39;m anti-anti-racist and no that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.359" end="00:38:43.200" style="s2">make me racist</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.680" end="00:38:46.079" style="s2">yep um yes it</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.200" end="00:38:47.920" style="s2">let&#39;s just put it this way it&#39;s a pity</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.079" end="00:38:48.960" style="s2">in some sense that you don&#39;t have a copy</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.920" end="00:38:50.400" style="s2">i understand why i don&#39;t want to buy a</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.960" end="00:38:52.880" style="s2">copy but the uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.400" end="00:38:55.040" style="s2">the illogic that is apparent as it</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.880" end="00:38:56.079" style="s2">proceeds is so obvious that you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.040" end="00:38:58.079" style="s2">it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.079" end="00:38:59.520" style="s2">liberal or conservative objection it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.079" end="00:39:00.480" style="s2">just an objection on the basis that this</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.520" end="00:39:03.200" style="s2">doesn&#39;t add up</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.480" end="00:39:03.920" style="s2">yeah no and um i mean i should save this</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.200" end="00:39:07.119" style="s2">for when i</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.920" end="00:39:08.640" style="s2">when and if i do do the formal takedown</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.119" end="00:39:11.920" style="s2">but um</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.640" end="00:39:15.839" style="s2">there&#39;s a um</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.920" end="00:39:19.839" style="s2">there&#39;s a point in chapter 10 where he</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.839" end="00:39:23.119" style="s2">reports on himself in college candy does</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.839" end="00:39:25.839" style="s2">as frankly such a racist</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.119" end="00:39:26.960" style="s2">that he believed enough to say to his</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.839" end="00:39:28.400" style="s2">college professor</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.960" end="00:39:30.079" style="s2">that he&#39;d figured out was wrong with</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.400" end="00:39:32.160" style="s2">white people and that the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.079" end="00:39:34.960" style="s2">that white people are aliens</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.160" end="00:39:36.720" style="s2">and his professor to his credit says are</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.960" end="00:39:37.520" style="s2">you high i mean he doesn&#39;t say that but</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.720" end="00:39:41.040" style="s2">you know what is</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.520" end="00:39:42.079" style="s2">wrong with you and um and candy sort of</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.040" end="00:39:44.079" style="s2">resolves oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.079" end="00:39:45.760" style="s2">i guess it doesn&#39;t make sense i guess we</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.079" end="00:39:47.280" style="s2">can breed together like this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.760" end="00:39:48.560" style="s2">the rejoinder from the professor</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.280" end="00:39:51.280" style="s2">you read it to me and unless i</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.560" end="00:39:54.480" style="s2">misunderstood it the professor</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.280" end="00:39:56.480" style="s2">tells him that can&#39;t be right because</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.480" end="00:39:57.680" style="s2">white people can interbreed right i</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.480" end="00:39:59.599" style="s2">can&#39;t take steps</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.680" end="00:40:01.520" style="s2">so that&#39;s what i meant to convey just</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.599" end="00:40:03.440" style="s2">now well</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.520" end="00:40:04.800" style="s2">what i take out of it is that kendy</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.440" end="00:40:06.880" style="s2">didn&#39;t get there on his own</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.800" end="00:40:08.319" style="s2">no he did not how could you not and not</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.880" end="00:40:10.400" style="s2">only did he not get there on his own</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.319" end="00:40:12.079" style="s2">he&#39;s okay 20 year old college student</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.400" end="00:40:13.839" style="s2">but he wrote it into this book and this</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.079" end="00:40:14.640" style="s2">isn&#39;t his first book right this is his</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.839" end="00:40:16.319" style="s2">latest book</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.640" end="00:40:18.000" style="s2">and he&#39;d already had a bestseller i</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.319" end="00:40:20.560" style="s2">think so this is some</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.000" end="00:40:22.480" style="s2">this is some crackpot racism that is</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.560" end="00:40:23.520" style="s2">proudly in this book on how to be an</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.480" end="00:40:26.240" style="s2">anti-racist</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.520" end="00:40:28.640" style="s2">but um but because he&#39;s redefined racist</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.240" end="00:40:32.560" style="s2">and anti-racist it&#39;s not racist</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.640" end="00:40:35.920" style="s2">to be racist yeah wow</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.560" end="00:40:37.760" style="s2">yeah yep yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.920" end="00:40:39.520" style="s2">your point about cuties being a book is</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.760" end="00:40:41.040" style="s2">interesting but as soon as it becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.520" end="00:40:42.160" style="s2">screenplay everyone involved becomes</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.040" end="00:40:44.319" style="s2">suspect</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.160" end="00:40:46.000" style="s2">yeah every 11 year old who auditioned</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.319" end="00:40:47.359" style="s2">now has an audition tape of performing</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.000" end="00:40:48.720" style="s2">those movements that will now last</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.359" end="00:40:51.760" style="s2">forever</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.720" end="00:40:55.520" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s true yep</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.760" end="00:40:58.160" style="s2">what i did wonder how old the actual</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.520" end="00:40:58.880" style="s2">actresses were not that it makes any of</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.160" end="00:41:01.280" style="s2">this better</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.880" end="00:41:02.960" style="s2">no um it would make it better if they it</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.280" end="00:41:03.440" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make it a lot better right but</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.960" end="00:41:05.040" style="s2">if they</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.440" end="00:41:06.720" style="s2">make it a little bit better right but</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.040" end="00:41:09.119" style="s2">the thing is they were so</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.720" end="00:41:09.839" style="s2">young they couldn&#39;t possibly have been</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.119" end="00:41:14.640" style="s2">adults</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.839" end="00:41:14.640" style="s2">yeah so it can&#39;t be fully better yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.119" end="00:41:20.240" style="s2">um no no no way does it get</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.240" end="00:41:23.119" style="s2">anywhere close to yeah not that it would</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.240" end="00:41:24.800" style="s2">be okay from the audience perspective</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.119" end="00:41:26.240" style="s2">and frankly you know as i said before i</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.800" end="00:41:27.040" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s even okay from the</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.240" end="00:41:30.319" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.040" end="00:41:31.280" style="s2">of um you know titillating a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.319" end="00:41:34.400" style="s2">old people</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.280" end="00:41:36.160" style="s2">but uh still it might be</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.400" end="00:41:38.000" style="s2">okay with respect to the fact that an</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.160" end="00:41:38.640" style="s2">adult is allowed to make a decision to</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.000" end="00:41:41.359" style="s2">be in a</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.640" end="00:41:42.800" style="s2">role like this um and then it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.359" end="00:41:44.240" style="s2">troubling from the point of view of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.800" end="00:41:45.280" style="s2">people selling this thing and the</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.240" end="00:41:49.200" style="s2">audience but</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.280" end="00:41:51.520" style="s2">yeah but it wasn&#39;t even that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.200" end="00:41:53.520" style="s2">would you agree that early homo sapiens</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.520" end="00:41:55.280" style="s2">evolutionaries</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.520" end="00:41:57.359" style="s2">having a hard time speaking today would</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.280" end="00:41:58.800" style="s2">you agree that early homo sapiens</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.359" end="00:42:00.240" style="s2">evolutionary success</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.800" end="00:42:01.839" style="s2">was due in part to our skill in</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.240" end="00:42:03.040" style="s2">addressing immediate threats like wild</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.839" end="00:42:04.720" style="s2">animals etc</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.040" end="00:42:06.240" style="s2">how has that played out and how does it</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.720" end="00:42:08.640" style="s2">affect our ability to address climate</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.240" end="00:42:08.640" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.599" end="00:42:16.480" style="s2">certainly the ability to deal</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.280" end="00:42:20.640" style="s2">with immediate threats like wild animals</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.480" end="00:42:21.680" style="s2">is a prerequisite to our success but i</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.640" end="00:42:23.440" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.680" end="00:42:25.119" style="s2">to the extent that you mean uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.440" end="00:42:26.800" style="s2">evolutionary success what you mean is</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.119" end="00:42:27.839" style="s2">our disproportionate evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.800" end="00:42:31.839" style="s2">success</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.839" end="00:42:33.359" style="s2">uh wild uh wild animals are not a</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.839" end="00:42:36.800" style="s2">sufficient explanation</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.359" end="00:42:41.200" style="s2">because a predatory ones are</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.800" end="00:42:44.160" style="s2">sufficiently um rare</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.200" end="00:42:44.960" style="s2">that they they just simply don&#39;t explain</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.160" end="00:42:47.680" style="s2">why</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.960" end="00:42:49.119" style="s2">you know humans got so much um smarter</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.680" end="00:42:50.880" style="s2">and more capable than other creatures</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.119" end="00:42:52.720" style="s2">that also have to deal with predators</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.880" end="00:42:53.920" style="s2">yeah known at the point i mean this is</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.720" end="00:42:57.680" style="s2">probably a</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.920" end="00:42:59.200" style="s2">level of sort of semantics that it was</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.680" end="00:43:01.280" style="s2">not intended by the question but if</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.200" end="00:43:04.240" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about early homo sapiens</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.280" end="00:43:06.000" style="s2">as opposed to early hominins that have</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.240" end="00:43:07.680" style="s2">split from the chimp lineage but aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.000" end="00:43:09.280" style="s2">yet fully homo sapiens</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.680" end="00:43:11.760" style="s2">by the time we&#39;re homo sapiens we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.280" end="00:43:12.000" style="s2">already gone far down the road we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.760" end="00:43:15.280" style="s2">already</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.000" end="00:43:16.720" style="s2">we&#39;ve already mastered fire uh we</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.280" end="00:43:19.119" style="s2">um you know a million and a half years</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.720" end="00:43:20.079" style="s2">ago ish and homo sapiens are newer than</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.119" end="00:43:22.480" style="s2">that i think</p>

<p begin="00:46:38.960" end="00:46:44.880" style="s2">like good how can we know whom to trust</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.359" end="00:46:47.359" style="s2">as a source for climate science</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.880" end="00:46:48.720" style="s2">skeptical of everything help love you</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.359" end="00:46:51.119" style="s2">both</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.720" end="00:46:52.000" style="s2">yeah uh as you should be skeptical of</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.119" end="00:46:53.760" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.000" end="00:46:55.440" style="s2">and how can we know whom to trust as a</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.760" end="00:46:58.319" style="s2">source for climate science</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.440" end="00:46:59.520" style="s2">this is a tough question and i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.319" end="00:47:01.200" style="s2">know if you have any</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.520" end="00:47:05.520" style="s2">names i don&#39;t actually have any names</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.200" end="00:47:05.520" style="s2">that i trust i just know that</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.000" end="00:47:10.079" style="s2">there are there are honorable and</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.800" end="00:47:11.359" style="s2">dishonorable climate scientists</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.079" end="00:47:13.839" style="s2">out there as they&#39;re honorable and</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.359" end="00:47:17.119" style="s2">dishonorable everything&#39;s out there</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.839" end="00:47:19.599" style="s2">and um because there is a conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.119" end="00:47:21.359" style="s2">that is now</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.599" end="00:47:22.880" style="s2">the the thing that is accepted it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.359" end="00:47:26.240" style="s2">harder to</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.880" end="00:47:29.119" style="s2">uh publish evidence that countervails</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.240" end="00:47:31.359" style="s2">uh the conclusion that said the</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.119" end="00:47:33.359" style="s2">conclusion has so much support</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.359" end="00:47:35.359" style="s2">the broad conclusion that anthropogenic</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.359" end="00:47:37.280" style="s2">climate change is happening</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.359" end="00:47:39.119" style="s2">from so many different kinds of evidence</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.280" end="00:47:41.040" style="s2">across so many different kinds of both</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.119" end="00:47:44.319" style="s2">empirical and modeling evidence</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.040" end="00:47:47.440" style="s2">that broadly speaking my my</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.319" end="00:47:50.800" style="s2">doubt of that conclusion is near zero</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.440" end="00:47:53.119" style="s2">but any individual result i am</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.800" end="00:47:54.960" style="s2">highly skeptical of even more so than of</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.119" end="00:47:57.440" style="s2">any other scientific result</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.960" end="00:47:59.200" style="s2">because it&#39;s become so politicized and</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.440" end="00:48:01.680" style="s2">i&#39;ll just tell i&#39;ll tell an anecdote</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.200" end="00:48:03.200" style="s2">an actual story here um back when we</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.680" end="00:48:06.319" style="s2">were professors at evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.200" end="00:48:08.640" style="s2">i was on a hiring committee to hire</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.319" end="00:48:09.359" style="s2">a climate scientist and one of our</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.640" end="00:48:12.720" style="s2">finalists</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.359" end="00:48:16.079" style="s2">so academic job hires you do</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.720" end="00:48:16.720" style="s2">you pull three people to the short list</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.079" end="00:48:19.599" style="s2">and you do</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.720" end="00:48:21.040" style="s2">a couple day interviews on campus with</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.599" end="00:48:22.400" style="s2">them and because it was climate science</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.040" end="00:48:24.000" style="s2">we dragged these people out into the</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.400" end="00:48:25.599" style="s2">woods and walked around the forest with</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.000" end="00:48:28.319" style="s2">them and talked with them</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.599" end="00:48:29.359" style="s2">one-on-one and um i was asking one of</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.319" end="00:48:32.559" style="s2">their candidates</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.359" end="00:48:35.520" style="s2">um one-on-one</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.559" end="00:48:37.119" style="s2">about a paper that he had published and</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.520" end="00:48:37.920" style="s2">asked him why in the methods he had</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.119" end="00:48:40.319" style="s2">talked about</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.920" end="00:48:41.920" style="s2">having used five models and it was you</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.319" end="00:48:43.680" style="s2">know like all these papers that had like</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.920" end="00:48:45.680" style="s2">20 authors on it or something</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.680" end="00:48:46.800" style="s2">um why there had been five models that</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.680" end="00:48:48.079" style="s2">were discussed</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.800" end="00:48:49.920" style="s2">in the methods but only one of them</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.079" end="00:48:53.359" style="s2">reported in the results</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.920" end="00:48:57.200" style="s2">and he laughed as if i was joking</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.359" end="00:48:58.400" style="s2">and i pursued it and then he said well i</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.200" end="00:49:00.079" style="s2">don&#39;t i don&#39;t know that&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.400" end="00:49:00.880" style="s2">that&#39;s not my that&#39;s that&#39;s not what i</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.079" end="00:49:03.440" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.880" end="00:49:05.359" style="s2">and i thought okay you know your name&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.440" end="00:49:07.440" style="s2">on this paper you&#39;re trying to get a job</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.359" end="00:49:10.000" style="s2">um doing exactly this work and you have</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.440" end="00:49:12.079" style="s2">no idea what justification there is</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.000" end="00:49:13.520" style="s2">for having said that you had put your</p>

<p begin="00:49:15.200" end="00:49:18.559" style="s2">that sounds like a replication crisis</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.119" end="00:49:20.000" style="s2">waiting to happen and know the guy did</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.559" end="00:49:23.520" style="s2">not get the job</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.000" end="00:49:26.319" style="s2">but i i worry that that happens too much</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.520" end="00:49:27.200" style="s2">um with the giant caveat like i started</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.319" end="00:49:31.359" style="s2">with</p>

<p begin="00:49:36.319" end="00:49:39.440" style="s2">including places uh where the scientists</p>

<p begin="00:49:44.559" end="00:49:47.599" style="s2">to the result the data overwhelmingly</p>

<p begin="00:49:47.599" end="00:49:51.680" style="s2">the conclusion that we are plummeting</p>

<p begin="00:49:51.680" end="00:49:54.720" style="s2">that may at some point become</p>

<p begin="00:49:54.720" end="00:50:01.280" style="s2">um i would say james hansen i find</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.000" end="00:50:02.640" style="s2">him trustworthy as a human being i would</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.280" end="00:50:05.839" style="s2">say i don&#39;t trust</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.640" end="00:50:07.680" style="s2">the models it&#39;s too easy to lie with</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.839" end="00:50:09.760" style="s2">models if you put enough factors in them</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.680" end="00:50:12.800" style="s2">you can make them mirror</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.760" end="00:50:13.839" style="s2">any behavior without doing so because</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.800" end="00:50:16.480" style="s2">they actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.839" end="00:50:17.760" style="s2">match the uh the causal element however</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.480" end="00:50:21.680" style="s2">easy to be a verificationist</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.760" end="00:50:23.920" style="s2">models yeah it is um models um</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.680" end="00:50:25.520" style="s2">can be used to predict things that you</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.920" end="00:50:27.040" style="s2">might go check empirically but they</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.520" end="00:50:31.280" style="s2">can&#39;t be used as an empirical</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.040" end="00:50:34.640" style="s2">check but what i would say is</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.280" end="00:50:39.200" style="s2">the that which we know for sure is</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.640" end="00:50:42.720" style="s2">already enough to worry um a great deal</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.200" end="00:50:45.440" style="s2">um co2 and methane trap</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.720" end="00:50:47.440" style="s2">heat from the sun we&#39;ve known this for</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.440" end="00:50:50.480" style="s2">more than 100 years</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.440" end="00:50:53.839" style="s2">the fact that both of those</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.480" end="00:50:54.960" style="s2">molecules are rising in their density in</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.839" end="00:50:57.359" style="s2">the atmosphere</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.960" end="00:50:58.559" style="s2">also known to be true that that will</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.359" end="00:51:01.280" style="s2">have some effect</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.559" end="00:51:02.800" style="s2">is certain how much the effect we can</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.280" end="00:51:04.000" style="s2">disagree because it&#39;s in a complex</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.800" end="00:51:08.319" style="s2">system however</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.000" end="00:51:11.040" style="s2">the important thing to track is that the</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.319" end="00:51:11.520" style="s2">um the danger that one hits a threshold</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.040" end="00:51:14.079" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.520" end="00:51:14.800" style="s2">at which for example the release of</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.079" end="00:51:18.000" style="s2">frozen</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.800" end="00:51:19.920" style="s2">methane clathrates from the arctic kicks</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.000" end="00:51:21.440" style="s2">us into a phase in which we no longer</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.920" end="00:51:24.000" style="s2">have any control</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.440" end="00:51:25.280" style="s2">over temperature because you get a</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.000" end="00:51:29.839" style="s2">positive feedback</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.280" end="00:51:33.839" style="s2">where the temperature goes up that</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.839" end="00:51:35.440" style="s2">unfreezes these frozen methane molecules</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.839" end="00:51:37.119" style="s2">they are quickly released that raises</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.440" end="00:51:39.200" style="s2">the temperature further which unfreezes</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.119" end="00:51:42.160" style="s2">more and you get a positive feedback</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.200" end="00:51:43.280" style="s2">that thing is not something you need to</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.160" end="00:51:44.880" style="s2">detect from here</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.280" end="00:51:47.359" style="s2">in fact you won&#39;t detect it until it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.880" end="00:51:47.680" style="s2">too late right you can detect that there</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.359" end="00:51:49.200" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.680" end="00:51:51.200" style="s2">these bursts of methane in the arctic</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.200" end="00:51:53.680" style="s2">which we&#39;ve now seen what we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.200" end="00:51:55.280" style="s2">is really good baseline data on whether</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.680" end="00:51:57.520" style="s2">that&#39;s happening all the time but there</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.280" end="00:51:58.640" style="s2">is reason the yamal craters which i</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.520" end="00:52:01.280" style="s2">pointed to</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.640" end="00:52:03.040" style="s2">in siberia tell us that there are new</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.280" end="00:52:04.000" style="s2">geological processes going on that</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.040" end="00:52:06.720" style="s2">appear to be the result</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.000" end="00:52:08.160" style="s2">of sudden releases of methane so what we</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.720" end="00:52:09.680" style="s2">know is</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.160" end="00:52:11.200" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole hell of a lot of methane</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.680" end="00:52:12.720" style="s2">up there that could come</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.200" end="00:52:14.400" style="s2">flooding out all of a sudden and could</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.720" end="00:52:15.119" style="s2">take this question entirely out of human</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.400" end="00:52:16.960" style="s2">control</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.119" end="00:52:18.720" style="s2">right we don&#39;t know where that threshold</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.960" end="00:52:20.400" style="s2">is it could could happen this evening</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.720" end="00:52:22.240" style="s2">okay the the fires could be the thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.400" end="00:52:23.599" style="s2">that do it right the release of carbon</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.240" end="00:52:25.440" style="s2">from these fires</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.599" end="00:52:27.760" style="s2">no idea where we are relative to that</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.440" end="00:52:31.119" style="s2">threshold we know that it&#39;s out there</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.760" end="00:52:32.559" style="s2">and um you know the day that it happens</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.119" end="00:52:33.440" style="s2">it&#39;s not going to make the news nobody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.559" end="00:52:34.960" style="s2">going to know that it happened but</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.440" end="00:52:35.839" style="s2">there&#39;s a day at which this no longer is</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.960" end="00:52:39.040" style="s2">under human control</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.839" end="00:52:40.559" style="s2">so the point is given what we can say</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.040" end="00:52:42.480" style="s2">for sure</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.559" end="00:52:44.160" style="s2">the rational course is to say we are</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.480" end="00:52:45.839" style="s2">playing with something very dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.160" end="00:52:47.839" style="s2">the downstream consequences are</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.839" end="00:52:48.720" style="s2">potentially absolutely catastrophic for</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.839" end="00:52:50.480" style="s2">humanity</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.720" end="00:52:52.079" style="s2">the solutions to these things are likely</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.480" end="00:52:54.319" style="s2">to be highly generative</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.079" end="00:52:55.280" style="s2">now here&#39;s the hitch if we were to solve</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.319" end="00:52:57.040" style="s2">these problems</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.280" end="00:52:58.880" style="s2">it would threaten the business models of</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.040" end="00:53:00.960" style="s2">many established businesses</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.880" end="00:53:02.319" style="s2">that&#39;s why we don&#39;t do it it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.960" end="00:53:04.240" style="s2">it would make life horrible</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.319" end="00:53:05.359" style="s2">for us to solve these things in fact</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.240" end="00:53:07.920" style="s2">speak a little bit more so</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.359" end="00:53:08.480" style="s2">you you hid you you buried a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.920" end="00:53:10.559" style="s2">you said</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.480" end="00:53:12.720" style="s2">um you know solving these problems could</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.559" end="00:53:14.960" style="s2">itself the solutions could be generative</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.720" end="00:53:16.079" style="s2">yeah like the solutions could actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.960" end="00:53:18.720" style="s2">be good</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.079" end="00:53:20.160" style="s2">for individual humans and the economy</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.720" end="00:53:23.520" style="s2">what it won&#39;t be good for</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.160" end="00:53:26.240" style="s2">is the established uh</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.520" end="00:53:27.440" style="s2">organizations that have already made a</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.240" end="00:53:28.880" style="s2">business in the old economy</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.440" end="00:53:30.480" style="s2">right and in fact you can see this by</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.880" end="00:53:33.119" style="s2">projecting backwards</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.480" end="00:53:34.079" style="s2">um we&#39;ve been talking about um you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.119" end="00:53:36.559" style="s2">carbon tax</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.079" end="00:53:38.559" style="s2">forever right a substantial carbon tax</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.559" end="00:53:39.920" style="s2">now carbon tax has a cost an economic</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.559" end="00:53:43.680" style="s2">cost it&#39;s substantial</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.920" end="00:53:45.280" style="s2">but if 25 years ago or 30 years ago we</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.680" end="00:53:47.200" style="s2">had seen this coming</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.280" end="00:53:49.040" style="s2">and we had instituted a moderate tax</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.200" end="00:53:51.040" style="s2">then which had driven</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.040" end="00:53:52.400" style="s2">the innovations in battery technology</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.040" end="00:53:54.800" style="s2">that we have seen</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.400" end="00:53:56.319" style="s2">right all sorts of things that we all</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.800" end="00:53:57.680" style="s2">regard as awesome</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.319" end="00:53:59.920" style="s2">about the modern world would have</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.680" end="00:54:00.880" style="s2">happened earlier that&#39;s what regulation</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.920" end="00:54:03.359" style="s2">is supposed to do</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.880" end="00:54:04.800" style="s2">right incentivize you to limit the next</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.359" end="00:54:06.800" style="s2">the negative externalities that you</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.800" end="00:54:08.960" style="s2">impose on the world right now the key</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.800" end="00:54:11.040" style="s2">thing would have been and frankly we</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.960" end="00:54:12.400" style="s2">were the country that dragged our heels</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.040" end="00:54:14.240" style="s2">but the key thing to do would have been</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.400" end="00:54:15.359" style="s2">to partner with other nations so that we</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.240" end="00:54:17.920" style="s2">would not have been</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.359" end="00:54:19.599" style="s2">at disadvantage for instituting that</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.920" end="00:54:23.040" style="s2">carbon tax we could have had that</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.599" end="00:54:25.440" style="s2">the cost um distributed in a fair way</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.040" end="00:54:26.880" style="s2">so the point is innovation of a kind</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.440" end="00:54:27.680" style="s2">that&#39;s great right you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.880" end="00:54:31.359" style="s2">breathe</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.680" end="00:54:32.800" style="s2">exhaust right frankly um i was using an</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.359" end="00:54:35.760" style="s2">electric chainsaw</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.800" end="00:54:37.040" style="s2">just early this week electric chainsaw</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.760" end="00:54:39.520" style="s2">it&#39;s pretty darn good</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.040" end="00:54:40.480" style="s2">right it&#39;s not loud it doesn&#39;t put out</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.520" end="00:54:41.839" style="s2">exhaust there are all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.480" end="00:54:44.079" style="s2">advantages and the point is</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.839" end="00:54:45.839" style="s2">it hasn&#39;t been plausible until recently</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.079" end="00:54:48.000" style="s2">because the battery technology has been</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.839" end="00:54:49.359" style="s2">lagging so</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.000" end="00:54:51.280" style="s2">if you can solve the economic</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.359" end="00:54:52.000" style="s2">competition problem and you can get</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.280" end="00:54:54.640" style="s2">everybody to</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.000" end="00:54:55.920" style="s2">share their bit of the burden and you</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.640" end="00:54:57.760" style="s2">are not</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.920" end="00:54:59.520" style="s2">constrained to protecting currently</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.760" end="00:55:00.720" style="s2">successful businesses you can do great</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.520" end="00:55:02.400" style="s2">things and so</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.720" end="00:55:04.799" style="s2">were we to address climate change it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.400" end="00:55:07.760" style="s2">getting late but were we to address it</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.799" end="00:55:09.520" style="s2">we would be living in a time when there</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.760" end="00:55:10.880" style="s2">was plenty to do for innovators</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.520" end="00:55:12.640" style="s2">because we would have to figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.880" end="00:55:14.079" style="s2">to do lots of things that we already do</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.640" end="00:55:15.520" style="s2">in some new and better way</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.079" end="00:55:17.280" style="s2">and so the point is that&#39;s a lot of good</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.520" end="00:55:20.480" style="s2">jobs yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.280" end="00:55:21.839" style="s2">so anyway that&#39;s the pitch</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.480" end="00:55:24.319" style="s2">let&#39;s try to get through a few more of</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.839" end="00:55:26.240" style="s2">these before sweat switching</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.319" end="00:55:28.079" style="s2">hypothetical for a thousand generations</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.240" end="00:55:30.720" style="s2">a lineage of isolated humans wore</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.079" end="00:55:31.359" style="s2">masks to hide from natural ills we did</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.720" end="00:55:33.760" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.359" end="00:55:34.480" style="s2">we experienced all else the same we meet</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.760" end="00:55:36.880" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.480" end="00:55:39.040" style="s2">their immune systems are stronger or</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.880" end="00:55:41.200" style="s2">weaker than ours</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.040" end="00:55:43.280" style="s2">well i hesitate with these stronger or</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.200" end="00:55:44.480" style="s2">weaker immune system things but i think</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.280" end="00:55:48.160" style="s2">in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.480" end="00:55:50.720" style="s2">we know the answer here because the</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.160" end="00:55:53.599" style="s2">germs in guns germs and steel</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.720" end="00:55:54.640" style="s2">are the result of the fact that um</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.599" end="00:55:59.040" style="s2">europeans</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.640" end="00:56:01.760" style="s2">who came to the new world</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.040" end="00:56:03.680" style="s2">were in some sense the beneficiaries of</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.760" end="00:56:04.400" style="s2">confrontations with germs that they had</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.680" end="00:56:06.240" style="s2">already had</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.400" end="00:56:08.160" style="s2">and the reason that it was europeans who</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.240" end="00:56:10.880" style="s2">had those confrontations with germs</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.160" end="00:56:12.720" style="s2">was that the domesticable animals were</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.880" end="00:56:15.760" style="s2">highly concentrated</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.720" end="00:56:19.559" style="s2">in asia and because um</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.760" end="00:56:23.119" style="s2">asia is uh it is</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.559" end="00:56:23.520" style="s2">longitudinally laid out the migration of</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.119" end="00:56:26.559" style="s2">those</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.520" end="00:56:28.240" style="s2">animals into europe was unimpeded</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.559" end="00:56:30.079" style="s2">and so the point was it was the close</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.240" end="00:56:32.880" style="s2">contact with</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.079" end="00:56:34.240" style="s2">pigs and cattle and other large</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.880" end="00:56:37.599" style="s2">domesticable creatures</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.240" end="00:56:39.520" style="s2">that caused europeans to have already</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.599" end="00:56:40.319" style="s2">had experience that made them durable</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.520" end="00:56:43.440" style="s2">with respect</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.319" end="00:56:44.400" style="s2">to many germs so most germs and the most</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.440" end="00:56:47.920" style="s2">deadly ones</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.400" end="00:56:50.480" style="s2">uh impacted uh natives of the new world</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.920" end="00:56:52.079" style="s2">um rather than conquistadors having</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.480" end="00:56:52.720" style="s2">brought back deadly diseases from the</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.079" end="00:56:55.119" style="s2">new world</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.720" end="00:56:56.640" style="s2">yeah um so i mean there&#39;s two there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.119" end="00:56:59.599" style="s2">two questions</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.640" end="00:57:01.280" style="s2">in one question here and you can&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.599" end="00:57:02.319" style="s2">can&#39;t do both at once because you have</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.280" end="00:57:04.559" style="s2">to control for one</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.319" end="00:57:05.680" style="s2">and um obviously it&#39;s a hypothetical</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.559" end="00:57:08.640" style="s2">that can&#39;t be done but</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.680" end="00:57:09.119" style="s2">um so you know old world meets new world</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.640" end="00:57:12.319" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.119" end="00:57:14.480" style="s2">um you know a story of allopatry um</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.319" end="00:57:15.760" style="s2">how you know could we ask this question</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.480" end="00:57:18.240" style="s2">with sympathy which</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.760" end="00:57:19.920" style="s2">you know to say um two populations</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.240" end="00:57:22.400" style="s2">living side by side</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.920" end="00:57:23.440" style="s2">one of whom is masked one of whom is not</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.400" end="00:57:25.839" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.440" end="00:57:27.359" style="s2">wherein they are being exposed to the</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.839" end="00:57:28.880" style="s2">same stuff</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.359" end="00:57:32.319" style="s2">except the people with masks are</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.880" end="00:57:36.079" style="s2">presumably getting exposed less</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.319" end="00:57:39.119" style="s2">what what then might be the distinction</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.079" end="00:57:40.720" style="s2">after a thousand generations between</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.119" end="00:57:44.720" style="s2">simply being exposed to</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.720" end="00:57:48.880" style="s2">fewer airborne and aerosolized pathogens</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.720" end="00:57:48.880" style="s2">versus more um</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.119" end="00:57:53.359" style="s2">i could i could see it going either way</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.839" end="00:57:54.240" style="s2">frankly it depends on exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.359" end="00:57:56.559" style="s2">pathogens</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.240" end="00:57:58.240" style="s2">were were met right like the pathogen</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.559" end="00:58:00.880" style="s2">the deadly pathogen</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.240" end="00:58:02.319" style="s2">uh that uh that you are saved from</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.880" end="00:58:05.119" style="s2">because you&#39;re wearing a mask that</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.319" end="00:58:07.359" style="s2">um otherwise wipes you out is obviously</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.119" end="00:58:09.760" style="s2">you&#39;re better off if you&#39;re masked</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.359" end="00:58:11.520" style="s2">over a thousand generations uh</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.760" end="00:58:12.400" style="s2">protecting yourself from every single</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.520" end="00:58:15.200" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.400" end="00:58:16.079" style="s2">that is that is out there might make you</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.200" end="00:58:19.920" style="s2">less resilient</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.079" end="00:58:22.480" style="s2">when um something flips a</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.920" end="00:58:23.760" style="s2">a vector model for instance you know it</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.480" end="00:58:26.960" style="s2">moves into say</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.760" end="00:58:29.839" style="s2">uh contact uh transmission rather than</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.960" end="00:58:31.520" style="s2">aerosol transmission i don&#39;t think so</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.839" end="00:58:33.040" style="s2">and the reason i don&#39;t think so is</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.520" end="00:58:34.799" style="s2">because of carrying capacity</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.040" end="00:58:36.400" style="s2">so if you&#39;ve got these two populations</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.799" end="00:58:39.440" style="s2">let&#39;s make them simpatric so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.400" end="00:58:39.440" style="s2">living in the same place</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.000" end="00:58:43.040" style="s2">but you expose one of them to more</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.240" end="00:58:47.119" style="s2">pathogens</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.040" end="00:58:49.920" style="s2">and some of them die that&#39;s selection</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.119" end="00:58:52.160" style="s2">for immunity and it will leave a</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.920" end="00:58:54.319" style="s2">population that has that immunity in its</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.160" end="00:58:56.079" style="s2">wake whereas the unexposed or less</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.319" end="00:58:57.040" style="s2">exposed population will have undergone</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.079" end="00:58:59.200" style="s2">less selection</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.040" end="00:59:00.880" style="s2">so it&#39;s not just the immunity that comes</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.200" end="00:59:02.319" style="s2">from the individual having encountered</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.880" end="00:59:03.200" style="s2">the pathogen that informs their immune</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.319" end="00:59:05.599" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.200" end="00:59:07.680" style="s2">it&#39;s this selection that favors immunity</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.599" end="00:59:09.280" style="s2">towards those pathogens so by the same</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.680" end="00:59:10.960" style="s2">logic that if you don&#39;t finish your</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.280" end="00:59:12.319" style="s2">course of antibiotics the bacteria that</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.960" end="00:59:14.319" style="s2">you leave are stronger and more</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.319" end="00:59:17.359" style="s2">resistant to antibiotics in the future</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.319" end="00:59:20.640" style="s2">the population that was uh</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.359" end="00:59:22.319" style="s2">that was what not wearing the masks or</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.640" end="00:59:24.559" style="s2">wearing the mask which way did your</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.319" end="00:59:26.559" style="s2">story go the population that was not</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.559" end="00:59:29.359" style="s2">wearing the masks will be stronger</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.559" end="00:59:31.359" style="s2">at the end of that selective yes that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.359" end="00:59:32.400" style="s2">that i mean so that&#39;s consistent i think</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.359" end="00:59:35.280" style="s2">with um</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.400" end="00:59:36.559" style="s2">what i was saying as well um so what</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.280" end="00:59:38.400" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.559" end="00:59:40.000" style="s2">you know the the obvious place to go</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.400" end="00:59:41.359" style="s2">then if i if we were in conversation</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.000" end="00:59:44.079" style="s2">with with jeffrey who</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.359" end="00:59:45.520" style="s2">who asked no it&#39;s different um with</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.079" end="00:59:47.599" style="s2">michael who asked the question</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.520" end="00:59:49.280" style="s2">would be okay then at what time scale</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.599" end="00:59:51.440" style="s2">does mask wearing makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.280" end="00:59:53.440" style="s2">like if if if at a thousand generation</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.440" end="00:59:56.480" style="s2">time scale</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.440" end="00:59:59.280" style="s2">um mass squaring might make um</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.480" end="01:00:00.319" style="s2">a population weaker at what time scale</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.280" end="01:00:01.920" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make sense</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.319" end="01:00:03.839" style="s2">and i think part of the answer is going</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.920" end="01:00:06.559" style="s2">to be um that for</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.839" end="01:00:07.520" style="s2">individuals no no individual wants to</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.559" end="01:00:09.200" style="s2">die of this thing</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.520" end="01:00:11.040" style="s2">so at the population level you might end</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.200" end="01:00:13.680" style="s2">up with a stronger population</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.040" end="01:00:15.040" style="s2">but individuals all want to survive</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.680" end="01:00:15.760" style="s2">right and so really what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.040" end="01:00:18.720" style="s2">comparing</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.760" end="01:00:20.000" style="s2">is for the individual the cost of</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.720" end="01:00:22.319" style="s2">getting sick</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.000" end="01:00:23.040" style="s2">and the risk of dying from being sick</p>

<p begin="01:00:23.040" end="01:00:29.280" style="s2">the cost of um being naive</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.040" end="01:00:30.880" style="s2">and naive to the pathogens to the</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.280" end="01:00:34.880" style="s2">pathogen and the problem is</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.880" end="01:00:38.000" style="s2">that the benefit to being naive to the</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.880" end="01:00:42.000" style="s2">pathogen is effectively zero</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.000" end="01:00:44.799" style="s2">um yeah so um the benefit of being</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.000" end="01:00:45.359" style="s2">not sick is substantial so and that fits</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.799" end="01:00:47.920" style="s2">with this</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.359" end="01:00:49.440" style="s2">um sort of filling the bucket model of</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.920" end="01:00:51.440" style="s2">exposure right you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.440" end="01:00:52.480" style="s2">you&#39;re not actually looking for zero</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.440" end="01:00:54.119" style="s2">exposure at all</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.480" end="01:00:56.000" style="s2">yep you&#39;re looking for a little bit of</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.119" end="01:00:59.520" style="s2">exposure</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.000" end="01:01:02.880" style="s2">occasionally over time such that</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.520" end="01:01:05.280" style="s2">your immune system can can</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.880" end="01:01:06.240" style="s2">maybe you know taste it and get a sense</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.280" end="01:01:07.599" style="s2">of what it is</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.240" end="01:01:09.440" style="s2">well you know i see a lot of people</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.599" end="01:01:12.160" style="s2">playing with this idea that</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.440" end="01:01:13.680" style="s2">low exposure to kovid for example might</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.160" end="01:01:15.520" style="s2">produce some sort of immunity it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.680" end="01:01:19.359" style="s2">hard to demonstrate that this is true</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.520" end="01:01:22.079" style="s2">of course um but it&#39;s it&#39;s plausible</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.359" end="01:01:23.280" style="s2">and it&#39;s consistent with the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.079" end="01:01:24.480" style="s2">apparently i don&#39;t i</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.280" end="01:01:26.640" style="s2">don&#39;t have it pulled up so i can&#39;t show</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.480" end="01:01:28.720" style="s2">you guys um but there&#39;s some recent work</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.640" end="01:01:31.760" style="s2">suggesting that mask wearers</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.720" end="01:01:32.960" style="s2">um mask squares compared to non-mask</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.760" end="01:01:36.640" style="s2">squares and otherwise</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.960" end="01:01:39.760" style="s2">um identical situations um have lower</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.640" end="01:01:41.200" style="s2">uh have less severe symptoms when they</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.760" end="01:01:44.160" style="s2">contract covid</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.200" end="01:01:45.920" style="s2">and so that again is suggestive of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.160" end="01:01:50.079" style="s2">sort of density dependent model</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.920" end="01:01:50.079" style="s2">of virulence of the disease</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.839" end="01:01:54.480" style="s2">okay critical race theory is spreading</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.040" end="01:01:56.160" style="s2">rapidly through public school systems</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.480" end="01:01:57.599" style="s2">corporations and even military schools</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.160" end="01:02:00.319" style="s2">what does the united states look like if</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.599" end="01:02:04.160" style="s2">these advocates get what they want</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.319" end="01:02:05.200" style="s2">wait um it kind of looks like the</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.160" end="01:02:08.559" style="s2">streets of portland</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.200" end="01:02:11.760" style="s2">well it looks like a failed state</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.559" end="01:02:13.760" style="s2">because we know that this is not a</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.760" end="01:02:16.079" style="s2">proper recipe for being able to compete</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.760" end="01:02:18.400" style="s2">with others and therefore anything</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.079" end="01:02:20.079" style="s2">that succumbs to this will be vulnerable</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.400" end="01:02:21.760" style="s2">in competition to anything that resists</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.079" end="01:02:23.920" style="s2">it and that goes for nations</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.760" end="01:02:26.240" style="s2">any nation that doesn&#39;t do this will be</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.920" end="01:02:28.400" style="s2">an advantage over nations that do this</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.240" end="01:02:29.920" style="s2">any school of engineering that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.400" end="01:02:32.880" style="s2">do it will produce</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.920" end="01:02:33.359" style="s2">you know higher quality graduates etc so</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.880" end="01:02:36.640" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.359" end="01:02:40.079" style="s2">seems pretty straightforward</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.640" end="01:02:41.680" style="s2">all right um several more um</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.079" end="01:02:43.839" style="s2">before we switch because many of these</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.680" end="01:02:45.359" style="s2">are comments love you both would be</p>

<p begin="01:03:04.880" end="01:03:08.400" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.160" end="01:03:09.760" style="s2">let me be careful about this many of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.400" end="01:03:11.839" style="s2">things candace says</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.760" end="01:03:13.760" style="s2">are right the question is why does</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.839" end="01:03:17.119" style="s2">candice say them</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.760" end="01:03:21.359" style="s2">and um i would love to believe that</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.119" end="01:03:21.359" style="s2">candace is growing up and</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.440" end="01:03:27.039" style="s2">becoming more nuanced but i don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.559" end="01:03:27.039" style="s2">see that</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.359" end="01:03:31.599" style="s2">i think the best model to describe left</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.200" end="01:03:33.440" style="s2">versus right is as explored versus</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.599" end="01:03:37.039" style="s2">unexplored territory</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.440" end="01:03:38.160" style="s2">conservatives so but except that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.039" end="01:03:39.440" style="s2">reversed i think so</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.160" end="01:03:41.119" style="s2">i&#39;m going to read it the way i think</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.440" end="01:03:42.880" style="s2">this person means it i think the best</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.119" end="01:03:44.240" style="s2">model to describe left versus right is</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.880" end="01:03:46.559" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.240" end="01:03:48.160" style="s2">unexplored versus explored territory</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.559" end="01:03:50.240" style="s2">conservatives seek to preserve what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.160" end="01:03:51.920" style="s2">established but can sometimes stagnate</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.240" end="01:03:53.440" style="s2">whereas liberals push new bounds but</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.920" end="01:03:55.119" style="s2">sometimes go too far</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.440" end="01:03:56.880" style="s2">and that&#39;s i think that&#39;s quite right</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.119" end="01:04:00.319" style="s2">that&#39;s quite good</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.880" end="01:04:02.160" style="s2">um uh a</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.319" end="01:04:03.599" style="s2">comment please talk with david friedman</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.160" end="01:04:04.559" style="s2">law professor economist theoretical</p>

<p begin="01:04:04.559" end="01:04:07.039" style="s2">oddly shunned by other libertarians</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.079" end="01:04:08.799" style="s2">because he&#39;s such a principled</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.039" end="01:04:10.400" style="s2">scientific thinker well that&#39;s a claim</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.799" end="01:04:12.240" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s why he shunned</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.400" end="01:04:13.200" style="s2">could be tragically underappreciated</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.240" end="01:04:14.000" style="s2">genius needs to be part of the</p>

<p begin="01:04:14.000" end="01:04:17.119" style="s2">i don&#39;t know the name do you know him no</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.440" end="01:04:19.039" style="s2">okay last question here and then we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.119" end="01:04:21.039" style="s2">skip to the ones from this hour</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.039" end="01:04:22.880" style="s2">do western states need to radically</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.039" end="01:04:24.799" style="s2">change their forestry management to</p>

<p begin="01:04:24.799" end="01:04:28.799" style="s2">or will that just make it worse are we</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.039" end="01:04:30.559" style="s2">missing pragmatic leadership versus just</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.799" end="01:04:34.559" style="s2">blame games</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.559" end="01:04:37.599" style="s2">uh yeah there&#39;s a lot of room for</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.559" end="01:04:40.160" style="s2">clever improvements on what we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.599" end="01:04:41.280" style="s2">and unfortunately we have a dearth of</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.160" end="01:04:43.680" style="s2">leadership and</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.280" end="01:04:44.319" style="s2">possibly a dearth of insight where it</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.680" end="01:04:45.920" style="s2">needs to be</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.319" end="01:04:47.920" style="s2">but yes we could be doing a whole heck</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.920" end="01:04:50.160" style="s2">of a lot better yeah</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.920" end="01:04:51.520" style="s2">uh so zach i don&#39;t see a line here but i</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.160" end="01:04:55.839" style="s2">think i&#39;m at 30.</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.520" end="01:04:55.839" style="s2">is that right</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.920" end="01:04:59.920" style="s2">no i think i think i got it um</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.880" end="01:05:08.079" style="s2">um yeah so the militant moderate is sort</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.799" end="01:05:10.079" style="s2">of filling in for us here on when joe</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.079" end="01:05:12.160" style="s2">rogan in episode 1535</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.079" end="01:05:13.839" style="s2">says that he likes tulsi feels like she</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.160" end="01:05:15.440" style="s2">was canceled by the dnc and then says</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.839" end="01:05:18.480" style="s2">later i love dan crenshaw that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.440" end="01:05:21.039" style="s2">guy who should run for president</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.480" end="01:05:24.720" style="s2">yeah tulsi and dan that&#39;s a cool idea</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.039" end="01:05:24.720" style="s2">yeah why have i heard that before</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.799" end="01:05:31.280" style="s2">with new waves of immigrants</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.839" end="01:05:32.720" style="s2">um with new with new waves of immigrants</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.280" end="01:05:34.400" style="s2">the first mixed couples seem to be</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.720" end="01:05:36.799" style="s2">newcomers men and women who&#39;ve been on</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.400" end="01:05:39.920" style="s2">the territory longer a generation later</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.799" end="01:05:39.920" style="s2">couples of newcomers</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.640" end="01:05:45.599" style="s2">are couples are newcomers women and</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.760" end="01:05:47.440" style="s2">established men</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.599" end="01:05:49.119" style="s2">is that a pattern and if so how would</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.440" end="01:05:52.480" style="s2">you explain it</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.119" end="01:05:54.880" style="s2">so um i&#39;m gonna this</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.480" end="01:05:56.319" style="s2">this is unintentionally sort of</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.880" end="01:05:59.520" style="s2">telegraphically written</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.319" end="01:06:01.680" style="s2">um or telepathically written um</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.520" end="01:06:03.440" style="s2">because of the limits on characters um</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.680" end="01:06:07.440" style="s2">but the question is</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.440" end="01:06:09.680" style="s2">arguing i believe is the observation</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.440" end="01:06:11.119" style="s2">is that new in new waves of immigrants</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.680" end="01:06:14.480" style="s2">when you have couples</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.119" end="01:06:15.680" style="s2">uh between the newcomers and the</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.480" end="01:06:17.440" style="s2">established people and i don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.680" end="01:06:20.000" style="s2">this means established people from</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.440" end="01:06:21.599" style="s2">the immigrant country or from the new</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.000" end="01:06:23.359" style="s2">country</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.599" end="01:06:24.880" style="s2">early on the mixed couples seem to be</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.359" end="01:06:26.480" style="s2">the men or the newcomers and women</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.880" end="01:06:28.720" style="s2">who&#39;ve been on the territory longer</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.480" end="01:06:29.599" style="s2">and then later on a few generations</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.720" end="01:06:32.079" style="s2">later</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.599" end="01:06:33.039" style="s2">when it&#39;s mixed couples it&#39;s uh women</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.079" end="01:06:34.960" style="s2">who are new</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.039" end="01:06:36.880" style="s2">and men who have been on the territory</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.960" end="01:06:39.839" style="s2">for longer and</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.880" end="01:06:40.240" style="s2">wait i&#39;m i&#39;m confused by what you said</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.839" end="01:06:44.079" style="s2">and i</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.240" end="01:06:47.520" style="s2">i don&#39;t quite get it when you have</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.079" end="01:06:50.559" style="s2">a an immigrant population the initial</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.520" end="01:06:55.680" style="s2">couples tend to be mixed couples</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.559" end="01:06:58.559" style="s2">right those couples tend to be</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.680" end="01:06:58.960" style="s2">resident men and newcomer women yeah but</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.559" end="01:07:02.000" style="s2">i think</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.960" end="01:07:03.440" style="s2">actually it means um from the old</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.000" end="01:07:04.079" style="s2">country but they&#39;ve just been there</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.440" end="01:07:07.440" style="s2">longer</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.079" end="01:07:08.960" style="s2">so um not resident of you know if we</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.440" end="01:07:11.599" style="s2">were talking about for instance</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.960" end="01:07:12.240" style="s2">jamaican immigrants to the u.s right um</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.599" end="01:07:16.559" style="s2">the claim</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.240" end="01:07:18.640" style="s2">isn&#39;t uh american</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.559" end="01:07:19.680" style="s2">women and jamaican men it&#39;s the other</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.640" end="01:07:21.839" style="s2">way it&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.680" end="01:07:23.280" style="s2">it&#39;s jamaican women from three</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.839" end="01:07:25.520" style="s2">generations ago who&#39;ve been here for</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.280" end="01:07:28.799" style="s2">longer and then newcomer jamaican men</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.520" end="01:07:31.119" style="s2">so it&#39;s not about um you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.799" end="01:07:31.839" style="s2">european descended americans it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.119" end="01:07:33.440" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.839" end="01:07:35.599" style="s2">it&#39;s about the immigrant population in</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.440" end="01:07:37.760" style="s2">all cases but how long you&#39;ve been in</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.599" end="01:07:40.559" style="s2">country</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.760" end="01:07:42.000" style="s2">so i don&#39;t think i get it then um i</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.559" end="01:07:43.680" style="s2">understand the question but i i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.000" end="01:07:45.839" style="s2">and i&#39;ve seen that i did see this</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.680" end="01:07:46.960" style="s2">question once before um on our private q</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.839" end="01:07:48.720" style="s2">a and i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.960" end="01:07:50.079" style="s2">i didn&#39;t go to it because i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.720" end="01:07:53.200" style="s2">recognize it as a pattern</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.079" end="01:07:55.200" style="s2">so i would want to um</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.200" end="01:07:56.960" style="s2">i would want to see some evidence of it</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.200" end="01:07:58.319" style="s2">actually being a pattern before i</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.960" end="01:08:00.240" style="s2">tried to do some sort of like an</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.319" end="01:08:01.359" style="s2">adaptive arm waving explanation for why</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.240" end="01:08:02.799" style="s2">it might be true because it&#39;s never</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.359" end="01:08:04.480" style="s2">occurred to me that it was true</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.799" end="01:08:06.480" style="s2">and i&#39;m not saying it&#39;s not i just have</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.480" end="01:08:08.319" style="s2">never seen it um</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.480" end="01:08:09.760" style="s2">and i&#39;ve never i&#39;ve never thought to</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.319" end="01:08:11.920" style="s2">look for it nor seen it before</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.760" end="01:08:13.359" style="s2">i think your interpretation is wrong i</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.920" end="01:08:17.279" style="s2">think what it means</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.359" end="01:08:20.799" style="s2">is when you have an immigrant population</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.279" end="01:08:23.600" style="s2">to an existing population that</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.799" end="01:08:25.679" style="s2">the first couplings interracial</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.600" end="01:08:29.040" style="s2">couplings will tend to be</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.679" end="01:08:32.000" style="s2">those men who are from the</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.040" end="01:08:35.199" style="s2">home population and women who are from</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.000" end="01:08:35.199" style="s2">the immigrant population</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.520" end="01:08:38.640" style="s2">you disagree that that&#39;s the i think</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.199" end="01:08:39.520" style="s2">you&#39;ve got it backwards so i think</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.640" end="01:08:40.640" style="s2">that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.520" end="01:08:42.319" style="s2">i think that&#39;s the way it is and i think</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.640" end="01:08:43.839" style="s2">that no i think so there&#39;s two different</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.319" end="01:08:45.679" style="s2">possible interpretations i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.839" end="01:08:46.960" style="s2">so you are i just don&#39;t think we should</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.679" end="01:08:48.719" style="s2">spend more time here but i think you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.960" end="01:08:49.199" style="s2">got it backwards from what she has said</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.719" end="01:08:50.560" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.199" end="01:08:52.480" style="s2">and then there&#39;s an interpretation that</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.560" end="01:08:52.960" style="s2">you and i have different that&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.480" end="01:08:56.319" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.960" end="01:08:59.120" style="s2">um immigrant men versus um</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.319" end="01:09:00.640" style="s2">native women versus immigrant men versus</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.120" end="01:09:03.440" style="s2">longer ago immigrant</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.640" end="01:09:04.799" style="s2">women um so that&#39;s the point of</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.440" end="01:09:06.719" style="s2">disagreement between you and me but then</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.799" end="01:09:08.640" style="s2">i think you just sort of reversed the</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.719" end="01:09:10.400" style="s2">hypothesis here in addition so i think</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.640" end="01:09:13.839" style="s2">we need more clarification and</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.400" end="01:09:16.719" style="s2">even just evidence because the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.839" end="01:09:18.400" style="s2">trying to come up with why a pattern</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.719" end="01:09:22.719" style="s2">that may or may not exist</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.400" end="01:09:25.359" style="s2">does exist is not maybe dangerous but</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.719" end="01:09:26.319" style="s2">kind of fruitless and not that useful in</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.359" end="01:09:30.000" style="s2">exercise</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.319" end="01:09:31.440" style="s2">i would say supporting the duopoly</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.000" end="01:09:33.600" style="s2">creates a dystopian future</p>

<p begin="01:09:54.239" end="01:09:58.239" style="s2">would be all right it seems like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.840" end="01:09:59.600" style="s2">probably more likely to be available yes</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.239" end="01:10:01.760" style="s2">while we were on the glitch question</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.600" end="01:10:03.280" style="s2">several people suggested that we get a</p>

<p begin="01:14:14.719" end="01:14:18.159" style="s2">autocracies and are expanding along</p>

<p begin="01:14:19.120" end="01:14:25.280" style="s2">example includes uh examples including</p>

<p begin="01:14:25.280" end="01:14:27.920" style="s2">so i don&#39;t i don&#39;t really know anything</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.719" end="01:14:29.760" style="s2">about the disney story i&#39;ve sort of</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.920" end="01:14:30.880" style="s2">heard the memories of it but i just</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.760" end="01:14:33.920" style="s2">can&#39;t speak to that</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.880" end="01:14:35.679" style="s2">what about ccp and and nazi germany yeah</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.920" end="01:14:37.120" style="s2">i don&#39;t think we want to leap to the</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.679" end="01:14:40.159" style="s2">nazi comparison</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.120" end="01:14:44.000" style="s2">too early the fact is um</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.159" end="01:14:46.800" style="s2">we do not as far as i know have evidence</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.000" end="01:14:47.920" style="s2">of the systematic extermination of the</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.800" end="01:14:50.000" style="s2">weaker</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.920" end="01:14:51.920" style="s2">we have evidence of concentration camps</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.000" end="01:14:55.199" style="s2">we have evidence</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.920" end="01:14:57.840" style="s2">of organ harvesting for sterilization</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.199" end="01:15:00.560" style="s2">so these things are really really</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.840" end="01:15:04.719" style="s2">terrible without rising quite the level</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.560" end="01:15:08.000" style="s2">of the nazis systematic extermination</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.719" end="01:15:11.360" style="s2">of jews homosexuals</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.000" end="01:15:15.679" style="s2">jehovah&#39;s witnesses gypsies</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.360" end="01:15:17.840" style="s2">right um so</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.679" end="01:15:18.960" style="s2">that&#39;s not to i mean look this shows the</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.840" end="01:15:20.560" style="s2">signs of</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.960" end="01:15:22.000" style="s2">a situation that does head that</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.560" end="01:15:24.239" style="s2">direction um</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.000" end="01:15:26.159" style="s2">but let&#39;s you know if we leap to that</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.239" end="01:15:26.880" style="s2">conclusion too early then we lose the</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.159" end="01:15:30.239" style="s2">ability</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.880" end="01:15:33.840" style="s2">to level that charge when it is</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.239" end="01:15:35.040" style="s2">apt so there&#39;s plenty of room for evil</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.840" end="01:15:39.040" style="s2">below that threshold</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.040" end="01:15:39.679" style="s2">yep so i can&#39;t tell if this is our</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.040" end="01:15:43.040" style="s2">screen</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.679" end="01:15:46.159" style="s2">or something doctor</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.040" end="01:15:46.159" style="s2">can you figure out what that says</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.719" end="01:15:54.480" style="s2">yeah so i don&#39;t know if that&#39;s supposed</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.480" end="01:15:57.120" style="s2">to be an s might be an s</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.480" end="01:15:57.920" style="s2">that&#39;s so in which case would be dr su</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.120" end="01:15:59.280" style="s2">doctor who</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.920" end="01:16:00.960" style="s2">with a maybe that&#39;s just supposed to be</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.280" end="01:16:04.239" style="s2">a diacritical mark and of course</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.960" end="01:16:07.280" style="s2">you youtube won&#39;t allow that doctor</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.239" end="01:16:10.239" style="s2">someone who sue said on jre</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.280" end="01:16:10.480" style="s2">equality does not mean symmetry so that</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.239" end="01:16:12.960" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.480" end="01:16:14.880" style="s2">absolutely true that has me rethinking</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.960" end="01:16:18.800" style="s2">my views on feminism</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.880" end="01:16:20.080" style="s2">um according to you what is the equality</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.800" end="01:16:21.600" style="s2">that you should aim for</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.080" end="01:16:23.520" style="s2">could people then argue women don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.600" end="01:16:24.960" style="s2">deserve certain rights because you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.520" end="01:16:28.000" style="s2">because you don&#39;t have certain</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.960" end="01:16:32.159" style="s2">capacities as men</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.000" end="01:16:35.360" style="s2">so i think equality under the law</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.159" end="01:16:36.159" style="s2">and equality in terms of outcome and</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.360" end="01:16:39.199" style="s2">ability</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.159" end="01:16:41.840" style="s2">are different and uh we</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.199" end="01:16:43.199" style="s2">are you know a liberal worldview</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.840" end="01:16:44.960" style="s2">democratic worldview</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.199" end="01:16:46.400" style="s2">suggests that equality under the law is</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.960" end="01:16:48.480" style="s2">something that we should all have</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.400" end="01:16:50.400" style="s2">and that we must strive for a hundred</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.480" end="01:16:51.280" style="s2">percent that is a place where equality</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.400" end="01:16:53.760" style="s2">of outcome is</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.280" end="01:16:55.840" style="s2">absolutely desirable and um should be</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.760" end="01:16:58.320" style="s2">what we are striving for</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.840" end="01:16:58.960" style="s2">that does not presume though and it</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.320" end="01:17:01.199" style="s2">should not</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.960" end="01:17:02.800" style="s2">presume that it means that we are</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.199" end="01:17:06.320" style="s2">actually the same</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.800" end="01:17:07.679" style="s2">uh and so uh</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.320" end="01:17:09.040" style="s2">well there&#39;s a lot more to say here but</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.679" end="01:17:09.920" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if we can get in the weeds</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.040" end="01:17:12.159" style="s2">here a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.920" end="01:17:14.320" style="s2">um i am not sure that i agree that</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.159" end="01:17:17.440" style="s2">equality under the law is a quality of</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.320" end="01:17:18.800" style="s2">outcome i think it&#39;s actually a cryptic</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.440" end="01:17:20.880" style="s2">form of opportunity</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.800" end="01:17:21.840" style="s2">the law is protecting the opportunity</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.880" end="01:17:24.880" style="s2">and is the</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.840" end="01:17:25.600" style="s2">is the balance of the law the blind</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.880" end="01:17:27.760" style="s2">justice</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.600" end="01:17:30.080" style="s2">that distributes the opportunity that</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.760" end="01:17:32.719" style="s2">comes from the legal protection</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.080" end="01:17:33.679" style="s2">yeah so i would say you know it&#39;s easy</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.719" end="01:17:35.920" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.679" end="01:17:37.760" style="s2">deal with uh equality of opportunity as</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.920" end="01:17:41.360" style="s2">a cliche</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.760" end="01:17:43.600" style="s2">um but i think i think the point is</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.360" end="01:17:44.560" style="s2">that is in some sense the opportunity we</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.600" end="01:17:46.080" style="s2">are talking about</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.560" end="01:17:47.840" style="s2">being equalized but there are two</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.080" end="01:17:50.960" style="s2">components right</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.840" end="01:17:52.400" style="s2">it is important that no group have an</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.960" end="01:17:54.000" style="s2">advantage</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.400" end="01:17:55.600" style="s2">at the level of opportunity and there</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.000" end="01:17:56.880" style="s2">are many groups that do have advantages</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.600" end="01:17:58.640" style="s2">at the level of opportunity</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.880" end="01:18:00.480" style="s2">though how that advantage is passed on</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.640" end="01:18:03.440" style="s2">and all these things are</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.480" end="01:18:04.480" style="s2">murky but it is also important that</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.440" end="01:18:07.840" style="s2">opportunity</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.480" end="01:18:10.000" style="s2">itself be substantial rather than</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.840" end="01:18:11.360" style="s2">trivial right so there&#39;s a question of</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.000" end="01:18:12.080" style="s2">how much opportunity and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.360" end="01:18:15.760" style="s2">question of where</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.080" end="01:18:18.000" style="s2">it is and we want to</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.760" end="01:18:19.920" style="s2">increase the amount of opportunity and</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.000" end="01:18:20.960" style="s2">decrease the level of its concentration</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.920" end="01:18:23.840" style="s2">and i think</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.960" end="01:18:24.719" style="s2">you know whether it&#39;s exactly equal it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.840" end="01:18:28.000" style="s2">never going to be</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.719" end="01:18:30.960" style="s2">but how the</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.000" end="01:18:32.719" style="s2">unfairness is distributed is should be a</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.960" end="01:18:34.640" style="s2">focus it should be distributed as evenly</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.719" end="01:18:38.560" style="s2">as possible</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.640" end="01:18:40.640" style="s2">and the opportunity should be as broadly</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.560" end="01:18:43.920" style="s2">distributed as possible</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.640" end="01:18:47.600" style="s2">good um wow</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.920" end="01:18:48.719" style="s2">i can&#39;t even get to my trackpad now uh</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.600" end="01:18:50.800" style="s2">what is the relationship between</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.719" end="01:18:52.719" style="s2">evolutionary biology and morality</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.800" end="01:18:54.320" style="s2">what universal moral taboos or ethical</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.719" end="01:18:57.679" style="s2">truths are rooted deeper than</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.320" end="01:18:59.120" style="s2">culture well i would say</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.679" end="01:19:01.840" style="s2">rooted deeper than culture is not what</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.120" end="01:19:05.199" style="s2">you&#39;re looking for culture is</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.840" end="01:19:07.679" style="s2">just as biological as genes it is a</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.199" end="01:19:09.840" style="s2">separate mode of transmission</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.679" end="01:19:09.840" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.280" end="01:19:17.280" style="s2">morality is effectively it</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.480" end="01:19:18.719" style="s2">is a product of evolution we know that</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.280" end="01:19:19.840" style="s2">it&#39;s a product of evolution because</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.719" end="01:19:22.239" style="s2">behaving morally</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.840" end="01:19:24.000" style="s2">is costly in obvious ways relative to</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.239" end="01:19:25.360" style="s2">the evolutionary goal of increasing</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.000" end="01:19:27.199" style="s2">fitness</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.360" end="01:19:29.040" style="s2">and so it must be paying its way somehow</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.199" end="01:19:31.440" style="s2">that is to say fitness may not be</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.040" end="01:19:33.920" style="s2">defined exactly as we expect it to be</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.440" end="01:19:35.120" style="s2">and morality can increase overall</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.920" end="01:19:36.159" style="s2">fitness</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.120" end="01:19:38.880" style="s2">you know you could increase your</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.159" end="01:19:40.719" style="s2">long-term fitness by</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.880" end="01:19:43.840" style="s2">foregoing short-term fitness enhancing</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.719" end="01:19:43.840" style="s2">opportunities for example</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.159" end="01:19:49.199" style="s2">but basically the answer is going to be</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.000" end="01:19:50.880" style="s2">rooted in trade-offs</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.199" end="01:19:53.040" style="s2">i wrote a paper about this many years</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.880" end="01:19:55.440" style="s2">ago i won&#39;t drag you through the logic</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.040" end="01:20:00.000" style="s2">of it but</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.440" end="01:20:03.840" style="s2">but for a lineage</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.000" end="01:20:05.679" style="s2">moral precepts that result in long-term</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.840" end="01:20:09.840" style="s2">enhancement of fitness</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.679" end="01:20:12.480" style="s2">meaning persistence will be favored</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.840" end="01:20:13.679" style="s2">and therefore will be inscribed in</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.480" end="01:20:16.960" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.679" end="01:20:20.320" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s basically the model</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.960" end="01:20:24.960" style="s2">you&#39;re an hour and 15 minutes okay</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.320" end="01:20:27.440" style="s2">let&#39;s uh let&#39;s do a couple more okay</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.960" end="01:20:28.719" style="s2">uh part one okay so we got two part</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.440" end="01:20:30.719" style="s2">question here</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.719" end="01:20:32.000" style="s2">uh jordan peterson said men use the same</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.719" end="01:20:33.840" style="s2">circuit to hunt when looking</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.000" end="01:20:35.120" style="s2">for mates dogs like toys that squeak</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.840" end="01:20:36.080" style="s2">when they bite it makes them think they</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.120" end="01:20:37.679" style="s2">made a kill</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.080" end="01:20:39.199" style="s2">in one uncomfortable context it seems</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.679" end="01:20:40.719" style="s2">women instinctively trigger this circuit</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.199" end="01:20:44.000" style="s2">in a similar way by spontaneously</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.719" end="01:20:46.239" style="s2">emitting dying prey animal noises</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.000" end="01:20:47.920" style="s2">that sounds pretty ridiculous to me i i</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.239" end="01:20:48.800" style="s2">have great respect for jordan peterson</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.920" end="01:20:52.159" style="s2">and his thinking</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.800" end="01:20:53.920" style="s2">and uh i don&#39;t i think he has been uh</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.159" end="01:20:55.679" style="s2">i think the woke left has tried to drag</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.920" end="01:20:56.320" style="s2">him through the mud and the woke left</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.679" end="01:20:58.159" style="s2">has</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.320" end="01:20:59.600" style="s2">merely ended up looking quite muddy and</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.159" end="01:21:02.560" style="s2">ridiculous as a result</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.600" end="01:21:04.080" style="s2">um but i and i&#39;d like to see what he has</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.560" end="01:21:06.639" style="s2">to say here but if he really says this</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.080" end="01:21:07.760" style="s2">i just think he&#39;s wrong well i will say</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.639" end="01:21:09.679" style="s2">the same circuit</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.760" end="01:21:11.120" style="s2">right hunting for mates hunting for</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.679" end="01:21:14.639" style="s2">print now i will say</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.120" end="01:21:18.560" style="s2">one thing one sees</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.639" end="01:21:18.560" style="s2">young women do is</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.960" end="01:21:23.040" style="s2">squeal to attract attention so i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.920" end="01:21:23.679" style="s2">know that that has anything to do with</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.040" end="01:21:26.719" style="s2">hunting</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.679" end="01:21:28.000" style="s2">but it does have to do with hitting some</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.719" end="01:21:29.679" style="s2">frequency that causes</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.000" end="01:21:30.880" style="s2">attention to be drawn to them at some</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.679" end="01:21:32.239" style="s2">moment when they are engaging in fact</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.880" end="01:21:33.679" style="s2">this happens in cuties</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.239" end="01:21:35.280" style="s2">right at one point which like i think</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.679" end="01:21:35.840" style="s2">both of us are like oh god they&#39;re doing</p>

<p begin="01:23:52.159" end="01:23:56.560" style="s2">because of lockdown for example</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.199" end="01:23:58.480" style="s2">and that we are not doing a holistic</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.560" end="01:23:59.440" style="s2">analysis we&#39;re missing how many deaths</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.480" end="01:24:01.199" style="s2">will be caused by</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.440" end="01:24:02.480" style="s2">economic failure blah blah blah all</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.199" end="01:24:05.520" style="s2">those things right</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.480" end="01:24:06.960" style="s2">this then results in a rejection of the</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.520" end="01:24:08.560" style="s2">idea that we should be doing drastic</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.960" end="01:24:10.080" style="s2">things because the death rate isn&#39;t what</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.560" end="01:24:12.880" style="s2">we feared it might be</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.080" end="01:24:14.239" style="s2">right i don&#39;t think the death rate is</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.880" end="01:24:16.719" style="s2">where it&#39;s at at all</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.239" end="01:24:19.440" style="s2">right so you know i saw somebody we</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.719" end="01:24:22.719" style="s2">respect on twitter the other day say</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.440" end="01:24:25.920" style="s2">you know the rate of death for</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.719" end="01:24:28.639" style="s2">kids under 16 is below</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.920" end="01:24:29.360" style="s2">some very low number tell me again why</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.639" end="01:24:32.320" style="s2">schools</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.360" end="01:24:33.920" style="s2">um are still happening remotely and the</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.320" end="01:24:36.159" style="s2">answer is well</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.920" end="01:24:37.520" style="s2">you know if kids can get it and they can</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.159" end="01:24:39.920" style="s2">and they&#39;re going to bring it home</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.520" end="01:24:40.560" style="s2">and they will and somebody else is going</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.920" end="01:24:42.880" style="s2">to catch it</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.560" end="01:24:44.639" style="s2">and they will and it&#39;s going to damage</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.880" end="01:24:46.400" style="s2">their heart or their brain</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.639" end="01:24:47.760" style="s2">then what is the cost of that</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.400" end="01:24:51.280" style="s2">interaction so</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.760" end="01:24:53.600" style="s2">that at least though is really complex</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.280" end="01:24:55.280" style="s2">right so the costs of schools being</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.600" end="01:24:56.239" style="s2">virtual to both the kids and their</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.280" end="01:24:58.000" style="s2">social development</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.239" end="01:24:59.280" style="s2">and the parents and their inability to</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.000" end="01:25:02.400" style="s2">have their lives</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.280" end="01:25:04.080" style="s2">is huge and um</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.400" end="01:25:06.080" style="s2">the fact that kids themselves don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.080" end="01:25:07.280" style="s2">appear to be getting sick is true</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.080" end="01:25:09.280" style="s2">even though all of these other things</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.280" end="01:25:12.560" style="s2">are true um</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.280" end="01:25:14.719" style="s2">i i&#39;m not sure where i fall</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.560" end="01:25:15.840" style="s2">out on what i think should be happening</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.719" end="01:25:17.040" style="s2">and very and i think it&#39;s different in</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.840" end="01:25:18.639" style="s2">different parts of the country different</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.040" end="01:25:20.239" style="s2">different parts of the world um but i</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.639" end="01:25:21.840" style="s2">can tell you for sure that virtual</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.239" end="01:25:25.280" style="s2">schooling is a farce</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.840" end="01:25:28.239" style="s2">oh it is it&#39;s a farce right um and</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.280" end="01:25:29.199" style="s2">um so you know what what are we doing</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.239" end="01:25:30.639" style="s2">this question though</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.199" end="01:25:33.040" style="s2">is both difficult but i think a little</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.639" end="01:25:34.560" style="s2">easier which is um</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.040" end="01:25:36.400" style="s2">it&#39;s not necessarily easier in the</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.560" end="01:25:39.120" style="s2">moment um but</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.400" end="01:25:40.480" style="s2">how do you talk to people you know</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.120" end="01:25:42.800" style="s2">people in your circle</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.480" end="01:25:44.639" style="s2">when like oh i finally get to see you</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.800" end="01:25:45.199" style="s2">but actually given that we don&#39;t live</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.639" end="01:25:46.560" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.199" end="01:25:48.320" style="s2">and aren&#39;t breathing the same air all</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.560" end="01:25:49.760" style="s2">the time we either have to stay far</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.320" end="01:25:51.840" style="s2">apart or mask</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.760" end="01:25:53.360" style="s2">and be careful because why is it that</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.840" end="01:25:56.480" style="s2">you imagine that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.360" end="01:25:58.080" style="s2">like why have you decided that um you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.480" end="01:25:59.040" style="s2">inherently safe for me that&#39;s not your</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.080" end="01:26:00.800" style="s2">decision to make</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.040" end="01:26:02.719" style="s2">right right so i have been having these</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.800" end="01:26:04.080" style="s2">conversations and typically i will take</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.719" end="01:26:06.000" style="s2">somebody outdoors</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.080" end="01:26:08.239" style="s2">to have a conversation and i&#39;ll say not</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.000" end="01:26:09.520" style="s2">to beat them up behind the woodshed</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.239" end="01:26:10.800" style="s2">those are different people we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.520" end="01:26:11.840" style="s2">a wood shed that&#39;s part of the problem</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.800" end="01:26:15.280" style="s2">oh right</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.840" end="01:26:15.840" style="s2">um but i will take people outside and</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.280" end="01:26:17.520" style="s2">i&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.840" end="01:26:19.760" style="s2">hey let&#39;s have this conversation outside</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.520" end="01:26:23.280" style="s2">where covet does not apparently transmit</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.760" end="01:26:23.840" style="s2">yet at least um the other thing that i</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.280" end="01:26:27.120" style="s2">will say</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.840" end="01:26:29.520" style="s2">when people are like you know isn&#39;t this</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.120" end="01:26:31.280" style="s2">uh mass business silly i&#39;ll say you know</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.520" end="01:26:33.920" style="s2">i think people have it wrong</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.280" end="01:26:35.440" style="s2">you should see the a you should go to</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.920" end="01:26:37.440" style="s2">the subreddit of</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.440" end="01:26:38.960" style="s2">people who have tested covid positive</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.440" end="01:26:40.719" style="s2">and look at the people who have</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.960" end="01:26:41.920" style="s2">long-term symptoms that don&#39;t seem to go</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.719" end="01:26:44.719" style="s2">away</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.920" end="01:26:45.679" style="s2">you should also look at the data on</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.719" end="01:26:47.520" style="s2">heart damage</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.679" end="01:26:49.600" style="s2">and long-term brain damage and you</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.520" end="01:26:51.600" style="s2">should realize that we don&#39;t even know</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.600" end="01:26:53.040" style="s2">whether you get long-term immunity after</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.600" end="01:26:55.120" style="s2">you&#39;ve had this whether the thing might</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.040" end="01:26:56.880" style="s2">reside in neurons blah blah blah blah</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.120" end="01:26:58.560" style="s2">and so the point is you say all here are</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.880" end="01:27:00.480" style="s2">all of these unknowns</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.560" end="01:27:02.639" style="s2">now the question is what do we do it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.480" end="01:27:04.239" style="s2">not clear to anybody because until those</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.639" end="01:27:05.120" style="s2">unknowns are answered we don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.239" end="01:27:07.520" style="s2">the costs are</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.120" end="01:27:08.320" style="s2">but yeah you know it may be that</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.520" end="01:27:09.840" style="s2">everybody</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.320" end="01:27:11.679" style="s2">you know you make let&#39;s say that half</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.840" end="01:27:12.239" style="s2">the people who got covid are going to</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.679" end="01:27:15.199" style="s2">lose</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.239" end="01:27:17.040" style="s2">a decade or more of their life that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.199" end="01:27:19.120" style="s2">probably extreme but yep</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.040" end="01:27:20.719" style="s2">but we don&#39;t know one way or the other</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.120" end="01:27:22.080" style="s2">it could be a larger number and smaller</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.719" end="01:27:24.480" style="s2">number of years</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.080" end="01:27:25.199" style="s2">right seems more likely but but the</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.480" end="01:27:27.199" style="s2">point is and</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.199" end="01:27:28.800" style="s2">you know if you&#39;re going to get it every</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.199" end="01:27:30.080" style="s2">five years</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.800" end="01:27:32.159" style="s2">because it&#39;s going to circulate and your</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.080" end="01:27:33.120" style="s2">immunity doesn&#39;t last what does that say</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.159" end="01:27:34.960" style="s2">to us you know so</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.120" end="01:27:36.880" style="s2">they&#39;re all of these things and from my</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.960" end="01:27:37.840" style="s2">perspective i don&#39;t know how we get to</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.880" end="01:27:40.239" style="s2">the conversation</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.840" end="01:27:41.280" style="s2">which is let&#39;s talk about what we should</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.239" end="01:27:44.080" style="s2">have done</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.280" end="01:27:46.159" style="s2">right we should have really locked down</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.080" end="01:27:47.679" style="s2">for a much shorter period of time right</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.159" end="01:27:48.560" style="s2">we should not be dealing with schools</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.679" end="01:27:50.960" style="s2">coming back</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.560" end="01:27:51.679" style="s2">in virtual form we should have taken six</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.960" end="01:27:53.840" style="s2">months later</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.679" end="01:27:56.239" style="s2">six weeks and we should have done this</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.840" end="01:27:58.800" style="s2">properly and we should have</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.239" end="01:28:00.320" style="s2">put everything necessary to get highly</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.800" end="01:28:03.440" style="s2">reliable testing so</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.320" end="01:28:05.120" style="s2">the con the combination of a very</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.440" end="01:28:08.480" style="s2">intense brief lockdown</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.120" end="01:28:10.239" style="s2">followed by um very accessible high</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.480" end="01:28:13.120" style="s2">quality testing would have been enough</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.239" end="01:28:14.000" style="s2">and the point is somehow we&#39;re or this</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.120" end="01:28:16.560" style="s2">even absent</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.000" end="01:28:17.360" style="s2">super high quality testing uh pooled</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.560" end="01:28:19.280" style="s2">testing</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.360" end="01:28:21.280" style="s2">uh that allows you then you know at the</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.280" end="01:28:22.719" style="s2">at the end of it like okay i</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.280" end="01:28:24.320" style="s2">would say i think university of arizona</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.719" end="01:28:25.920" style="s2">maybe is is</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.320" end="01:28:27.440" style="s2">is testing their student population this</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.920" end="01:28:28.880" style="s2">way and actually keeping numbers low</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.440" end="01:28:30.239" style="s2">compared to like every other college</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.880" end="01:28:31.360" style="s2">campus that actually has so by pool</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.239" end="01:28:32.800" style="s2">testing you mean you pull a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.360" end="01:28:34.480" style="s2">people together and if anybody tests</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.800" end="01:28:35.520" style="s2">positive then you do the fine grain so</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.480" end="01:28:37.760" style="s2">it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.520" end="01:28:39.040" style="s2">like everyone being regularly tested a</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.760" end="01:28:40.800" style="s2">lot you know frequently</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.040" end="01:28:42.560" style="s2">but you know every test is like a hunt</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.800" end="01:28:45.040" style="s2">inputs from 100 people</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.560" end="01:28:46.719" style="s2">and you have to have very very low false</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.040" end="01:28:49.120" style="s2">false positives for this to work</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.719" end="01:28:50.000" style="s2">yes um but the false negatives don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.120" end="01:28:53.600" style="s2">matter as much</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.000" end="01:28:54.480" style="s2">because um well they don&#39;t matter as</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.600" end="01:28:56.239" style="s2">much</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.480" end="01:28:57.520" style="s2">so yeah any any positive you get from</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.239" end="01:28:58.639" style="s2">that then you you know break it into</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.520" end="01:29:00.080" style="s2">groups of ten whatever</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.639" end="01:29:02.560" style="s2">i don&#39;t know exactly what the protocols</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.080" end="01:29:02.960" style="s2">are but yeah um you actually can just</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.560" end="01:29:04.560" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.960" end="01:29:06.320" style="s2">really quickly get through a whole bunch</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.560" end="01:29:08.960" style="s2">of tests this way and</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.320" end="01:29:10.480" style="s2">and rule out okay all you guys are safe</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.960" end="01:29:12.320" style="s2">and you can like still be careful but</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.480" end="01:29:14.880" style="s2">you can go about your business right</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.320" end="01:29:15.679" style="s2">yeah but what i&#39;m trying to get past is</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.880" end="01:29:19.199" style="s2">the sense</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.679" end="01:29:20.000" style="s2">that what has unfolded is a vindication</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.199" end="01:29:21.760" style="s2">for the side</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.000" end="01:29:23.520" style="s2">that wasn&#39;t all that worried about this</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.760" end="01:29:25.360" style="s2">in the first place i am</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.520" end="01:29:26.880" style="s2">you know if anything more worried than i</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.360" end="01:29:27.920" style="s2">was because of all the things we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.880" end="01:29:29.920" style="s2">know and the fact that we</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.920" end="01:29:31.360" style="s2">what we&#39;ve learned is pretty frightening</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.920" end="01:29:34.400" style="s2">even if it doesn&#39;t amount to</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.360" end="01:29:35.840" style="s2">sudden death for people um so</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.400" end="01:29:38.000" style="s2">the point is look i don&#39;t really want</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.840" end="01:29:40.080" style="s2">responsibility for what to do now</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.000" end="01:29:41.840" style="s2">i want to say what should we have done</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.080" end="01:29:43.520" style="s2">then and who was saying that</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.840" end="01:29:44.960" style="s2">why didn&#39;t we listen to those voices and</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.520" end="01:29:46.400" style="s2">what are they saying now</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.960" end="01:29:49.440" style="s2">right that that i think is what we</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.400" end="01:29:51.360" style="s2">should be doing and it doesn&#39;t amount to</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.440" end="01:29:53.199" style="s2">let&#39;s end this lockdown already this was</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.360" end="01:29:54.080" style="s2">a false alarm because that&#39;s not that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.199" end="01:29:57.679" style="s2">not what happened</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.080" end="01:29:59.360" style="s2">yeah okay we&#39;re done except there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.679" end="01:30:00.000" style="s2">more comment that i think we need to end</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.360" end="01:30:02.000" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.000" end="01:30:03.280" style="s2">which is quote i saw a moose in the</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.000" end="01:30:06.560" style="s2">desert end quote</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.280" end="01:30:09.120" style="s2">bartender i&#39;ll have what he&#39;s having</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.560" end="01:30:11.120" style="s2">it&#39;s called a moose in the desert that</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.120" end="01:30:12.639" style="s2">was basically my reaction when you came</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.120" end="01:30:14.000" style="s2">home with the boys from that field trip</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.639" end="01:30:16.560" style="s2">that you&#39;d run with one of your classes</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.000" end="01:30:18.880" style="s2">like we saw a moose at sun lakes sure</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.560" end="01:30:18.880" style="s2">you did</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.280" end="01:30:22.080" style="s2">and but i think that was the reaction of</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.480" end="01:30:22.480" style="s2">the ranger too right you told the ranger</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.080" end="01:30:24.719" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.480" end="01:30:26.560" style="s2">but but i still struggle with the</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.719" end="01:30:28.880" style="s2">rangers reaction because</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.560" end="01:30:30.800" style="s2">i saw moose in the desert i was with a</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.880" end="01:30:32.400" style="s2">great number of people who also saw it</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.800" end="01:30:33.360" style="s2">so i knew it wasn&#39;t a hallucination</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.400" end="01:30:35.440" style="s2">y&#39;all weren&#39;t tripping</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.360" end="01:30:36.960" style="s2">we weren&#39;t tripping okay uh we were</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.440" end="01:30:38.239" style="s2">field tripping but we weren&#39;t tripping</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.960" end="01:30:40.800" style="s2">tripping and anyway</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.239" end="01:30:43.040" style="s2">so saw the thing i&#39;m a mammologist i</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.800" end="01:30:45.440" style="s2">know a damn moose when i see one</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.040" end="01:30:47.040" style="s2">so anyway i said to the ranger i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.440" end="01:30:49.840" style="s2">know if this was the first time this had</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.040" end="01:30:52.960" style="s2">ever happened i said to the ranger</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.840" end="01:30:56.719" style="s2">i believe i saw a moose out at</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.960" end="01:30:59.840" style="s2">deep lake and he says i don&#39;t think so</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.719" end="01:31:01.520" style="s2">and um you know i</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.840" end="01:31:02.880" style="s2">i said i feel pretty certain it was</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.520" end="01:31:06.159" style="s2">there he said no</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.880" end="01:31:08.000" style="s2">um and i said has there ever been one</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.159" end="01:31:08.639" style="s2">here before he said it happens every now</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.000" end="01:31:11.520" style="s2">and again</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.639" end="01:31:13.280" style="s2">and it was like well if i just told you</p>

<p begin="01:31:13.280" end="01:31:16.320" style="s2">and again doesn&#39;t it stand to reason</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.040" end="01:31:18.080" style="s2">that that was</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.320" end="01:31:19.600" style="s2">the moose in question oh that&#39;s that is</p>
