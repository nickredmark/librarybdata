<p begin="00:01:33.689" end="00:01:38.520" style="s2">do you feel it to be bound and where do</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.640" end="00:01:40.439" style="s2">you think it to be bound I know but what</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.520" end="00:01:42.600" style="s2">your thoughts are these informed by</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.439" end="00:01:46.619" style="s2">psychedelic experience do you know the</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.600" end="00:01:47.880" style="s2">biological mechanism of the binding well</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.619" end="00:01:53.450" style="s2">I thought I understood the question</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.880" end="00:01:55.920" style="s2">until the last question in the sequence</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.450" end="00:01:57.869" style="s2">the question with regard to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.920" end="00:01:59.340" style="s2">biological mechanism of the bio the</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.869" end="00:02:01.920" style="s2">binding and the binding seems like</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.340" end="00:02:04.140" style="s2">something very precise and it could</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.920" end="00:02:07.280" style="s2">refer to the binding of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.140" end="00:02:10.890" style="s2">neurotransmitter mimic in a psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.280" end="00:02:12.790" style="s2">anthea Jim but I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.890" end="00:02:15.069" style="s2">what it&#39;s getting at I would say</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.790" end="00:02:16.629" style="s2">the question is informed by psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.069" end="00:02:18.489" style="s2">experience that&#39;s one thing I think is</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.629" end="00:02:20.909" style="s2">true you think it&#39;s immediately informed</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.489" end="00:02:24.939" style="s2">by second are necessarily it seems quite</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.909" end="00:02:26.890" style="s2">quite clear headed I think although I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.939" end="00:02:28.540" style="s2">not sure I think there&#39;s a premise here</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.890" end="00:02:30.189" style="s2">that we might disagree with if I could</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.540" end="00:02:32.019" style="s2">quite understand what the premises but</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.189" end="00:02:35.400" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure I know what it is yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.019" end="00:02:39.250" style="s2">suspect that much to the annoyance of</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.400" end="00:02:42.849" style="s2">all sorts of people that consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.250" end="00:02:45.129" style="s2">individual consciousness is a feature of</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.849" end="00:02:49.840" style="s2">the mind the mind being what the brain</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.129" end="00:02:52.389" style="s2">does and therefore we&#39;re in the brain</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.840" end="00:02:53.590" style="s2">does that mean that there&#39;s nothing to</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.389" end="00:02:55.959" style="s2">thinking about it in any other way</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.590" end="00:02:58.419" style="s2">probably not but yeah from the</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.959" end="00:02:59.799" style="s2">perspective of what kinds of damage you</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.419" end="00:03:02.769" style="s2">might get that would interfere with your</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.799" end="00:03:06.150" style="s2">consciousness I suspect it is localized</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.769" end="00:03:10.060" style="s2">in that way and you know I would say</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.150" end="00:03:15.700" style="s2">localized and with ever less strength</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.060" end="00:03:18.699" style="s2">potentially the less dense you are with</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.700" end="00:03:19.989" style="s2">regard to nerves so you know the CNS the</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.699" end="00:03:21.870" style="s2">central nervous system which includes</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.989" end="00:03:25.900" style="s2">much as the brain but the spinal cord</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.870" end="00:03:28.359" style="s2">might be the the core area and there are</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.900" end="00:03:30.849" style="s2">things that the motor neurons and</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.359" end="00:03:33.449" style="s2">sensory neurons may be doing and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.849" end="00:03:35.440" style="s2">inter neurons that it could be</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.449" end="00:03:37.629" style="s2">transmitting aspects of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.440" end="00:03:39.909" style="s2">that we don&#39;t understand I&#39;m not going</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.629" end="00:03:43.329" style="s2">to ask you how dense you think I am with</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.909" end="00:03:45.760" style="s2">the neurons or anything else but I will</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.329" end="00:03:47.079" style="s2">say for cliff and anybody else who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.760" end="00:03:48.970" style="s2">interested in our thinking on</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.079" end="00:03:51.870" style="s2">consciousness what we have argued is</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.970" end="00:03:55.329" style="s2">that individual consciousness is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.870" end="00:03:56.709" style="s2">secondary adaptation that follows from</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.329" end="00:03:58.780" style="s2">the consciousness that exists between</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.709" end="00:04:01.199" style="s2">individuals and the consciousness that</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.780" end="00:04:03.489" style="s2">exists between individuals is not</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.199" end="00:04:05.709" style="s2">localized in the same way in the mind</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.489" end="00:04:07.510" style="s2">that&#39;s where the model would take place</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.709" end="00:04:09.009" style="s2">but the fact that it is an emergent</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.510" end="00:04:11.680" style="s2">property between two people means that</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.009" end="00:04:13.930" style="s2">it is in effect not localized in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.680" end="00:04:14.919" style="s2">same sense so I don&#39;t know if that</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.930" end="00:04:19.320" style="s2">answers your question</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.919" end="00:04:19.320" style="s2">cliff but I I hope it shed some light</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.420" end="00:04:26.540" style="s2">next question do you think the truth</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.890" end="00:04:28.070" style="s2">scales if so might the prints with what</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.540" end="00:04:30.590" style="s2">certain is Laszlo&#39;s hierarchy I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.070" end="00:04:33.350" style="s2">he&#39;s referring to Maslow&#39;s hierarchy of</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.590" end="00:04:36.380" style="s2">needs distinguishing noble and common</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.350" end="00:04:38.240" style="s2">needs or people be a good barometer for</p>

<p begin="00:04:44.630" end="00:04:50.180" style="s2">bit has packed a lot into this question</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.060" end="00:04:51.980" style="s2">let me just say it again so that it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.180" end="00:04:53.660" style="s2">think there&#39;s three questions there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.980" end="00:04:56.210" style="s2">there&#39;s a question and two possible</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.660" end="00:04:58.030" style="s2">answers here do you think truth scales</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.210" end="00:05:00.560" style="s2">if we think the answer is yes</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.030" end="00:05:04.250" style="s2">Nate posits that perhaps the prince</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.560" end="00:05:06.760" style="s2">which is Machiavelli&#39;s famous book in</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.250" end="00:05:09.050" style="s2">which the noble versus the common</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.760" end="00:05:11.990" style="s2">descriptor that Machiavelli uses might</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.050" end="00:05:14.090" style="s2">be mapped on to Laszlo&#39;s Maslow&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.990" end="00:05:16.370" style="s2">hierarchy even the aides be a good</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.090" end="00:05:19.240" style="s2">barometer for self-governance and might</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.370" end="00:05:21.860" style="s2">Petersons 12 roles be a good model for</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.240" end="00:05:24.170" style="s2">government governance that&#39;s how I</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.860" end="00:05:27.860" style="s2">understand the question but it&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.170" end="00:05:29.930" style="s2">a lot more to be impact there some</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.860" end="00:05:33.410" style="s2">truths scale at least to some extent</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.930" end="00:05:37.850" style="s2">through any true scale infinitely hard</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.410" end="00:05:40.790" style="s2">to say I&#39;m concerned about anything like</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.850" end="00:05:43.690" style="s2">trying to take something like The Prince</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.790" end="00:05:47.000" style="s2">and yes it might be better if your</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.690" end="00:05:48.620" style="s2">Machiavellian tendencies unfolded</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.000" end="00:05:50.270" style="s2">internal to you as an individual it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.620" end="00:05:51.050" style="s2">probably a closer approximation of</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.270" end="00:05:55.270" style="s2">something decent</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.050" end="00:05:59.060" style="s2">but the problem is you might well end up</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.270" end="00:06:02.660" style="s2">deferring to some entirely somatic view</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.060" end="00:06:07.040" style="s2">of life where you effectively took that</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.660" end="00:06:10.580" style="s2">as a license for hedonism which I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.040" end="00:06:12.770" style="s2">think is a very good use of a life so no</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.580" end="00:06:14.570" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t advocate it as a principle</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.770" end="00:06:16.790" style="s2">maybe the harm you do is to yourself</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.570" end="00:06:20.360" style="s2">rather than to others so it&#39;s not so</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.790" end="00:06:22.310" style="s2">onerous but but anyway I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.360" end="00:06:26.830" style="s2">about it and that doesn&#39;t strike me that</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.310" end="00:06:30.710" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s 12 rules are scaled properly</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.830" end="00:06:32.870" style="s2">for for the governance of populations I</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.710" end="00:06:35.540" style="s2">don&#39;t use their intent and I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.870" end="00:06:37.250" style="s2">quite precisely I&#39;ve read the book and I</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.540" end="00:06:39.350" style="s2">found it quite excellent</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.250" end="00:06:41.660" style="s2">but it is specifically about how</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.350" end="00:06:43.310" style="s2">individuals should act I feel like it is</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.660" end="00:06:45.860" style="s2">it is far better in that first position</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.310" end="00:06:47.390" style="s2">of a good barometer for how to govern</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.860" end="00:06:49.280" style="s2">oneself or at least how to start</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.390" end="00:06:52.040" style="s2">governing oneself before you figure out</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.280" end="00:06:54.620" style="s2">how you may be different from your</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.040" end="00:06:56.570" style="s2">neighbors but that it doesn&#39;t seem</p>

<p begin="00:06:56.570" end="00:07:00.350" style="s2">level analysis and I think I think you</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.240" end="00:07:02.150" style="s2">would agree with that although I&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.350" end="00:07:04.430" style="s2">curious to have that conversation I</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.150" end="00:07:05.420" style="s2">suspect it and then with regard to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.430" end="00:07:07.070" style="s2">first part of the question which you</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.420" end="00:07:10.700" style="s2">already addressed you think truth scales</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.070" end="00:07:13.790" style="s2">I would say maybe that patterns and</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.700" end="00:07:16.520" style="s2">ideas may scale so you know selection</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.790" end="00:07:18.320" style="s2">for instance natural selection exists at</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.520" end="00:07:20.660" style="s2">all of these different levels and across</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.320" end="00:07:24.800" style="s2">domains even in non biological domains</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.660" end="00:07:27.860" style="s2">and so that is a kind of scaling whereas</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.800" end="00:07:30.230" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it depends on what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.860" end="00:07:32.330" style="s2">truth were talking about and that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.230" end="00:07:35.210" style="s2">like a wishy-washy trying to get out of</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.330" end="00:07:38.150" style="s2">the question but some truths will scale</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.210" end="00:07:41.840" style="s2">maybe never infinitely but some truths</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.150" end="00:07:44.000" style="s2">are completely hyper local to the space</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.840" end="00:07:45.680" style="s2">and time in which they exist yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.000" end="00:07:47.840" style="s2">I think you&#39;ve done a good job of</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.680" end="00:07:50.870" style="s2">nailing the most likely candidate which</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.840" end="00:07:53.680" style="s2">would be that the things that accumulate</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.870" end="00:08:00.130" style="s2">in the universe will be patterns that</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.680" end="00:08:02.480" style="s2">come into existence frequently that are</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.130" end="00:08:04.670" style="s2">similar to each other when they do so</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.480" end="00:08:08.870" style="s2">they&#39;re recognized as a category that</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.670" end="00:08:14.660" style="s2">are durable upon arrival and that</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.870" end="00:08:17.240" style="s2">capture limited substances or other</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.660" end="00:08:20.180" style="s2">properties of the universe such that</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.240" end="00:08:22.760" style="s2">they effectively out-compete other</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.180" end="00:08:25.280" style="s2">things that might contain them so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.760" end="00:08:27.440" style="s2">a that&#39;s the underlying substrata on</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.280" end="00:08:28.670" style="s2">which Darwinism floats and it applies to</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.440" end="00:08:30.110" style="s2">all sorts of things that have nothing to</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.670" end="00:08:32.300" style="s2">do with biology and so if we just apply</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.110" end="00:08:35.270" style="s2">it to patterns yes that&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.300" end="00:08:37.580" style="s2">likely thing to apply at every scale in</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.270" end="00:08:39.890" style="s2">the universe but then again what do we</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.580" end="00:08:43.790" style="s2">do you know it tops out at the universe</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.890" end="00:08:45.020" style="s2">I think maybe not all right all right</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.790" end="00:08:47.090" style="s2">next question</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.020" end="00:08:48.710" style="s2">from Raphael with gatekeeping and</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.090" end="00:08:51.590" style="s2">academia and the crisis happening</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.710" end="00:08:53.420" style="s2">together how do and the current pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.590" end="00:08:55.850" style="s2">crisis presumably how do graduate</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.420" end="00:08:58.820" style="s2">students live and participate what to do</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.850" end="00:09:00.140" style="s2">if advisors are gatekeepers advice if</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.820" end="00:09:01.550" style="s2">you can&#39;t find positions because of</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.140" end="00:09:05.900" style="s2">gatekeepers and theoretical parts of</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.550" end="00:09:07.760" style="s2">science and math oh man this is a good</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.900" end="00:09:10.730" style="s2">and clearly heartfelt and difficult</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.760" end="00:09:14.870" style="s2">question I think the best we can do is</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.730" end="00:09:16.900" style="s2">probably we feel for you and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.870" end="00:09:19.280" style="s2">really terrible situation but the way</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.900" end="00:09:21.920" style="s2">limited resources are allocated in</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.280" end="00:09:25.340" style="s2">science puts people in charge many of</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.920" end="00:09:27.110" style="s2">whom are not worthy of that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.340" end="00:09:32.330" style="s2">responsibility and we&#39;ve seen it up</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.110" end="00:09:33.830" style="s2">close and many people who might steer us</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.330" end="00:09:36.560" style="s2">in a much better direction if they were</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.830" end="00:09:38.260" style="s2">liberated to do so are constrained by</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.560" end="00:09:41.570" style="s2">the fact that they are effectively</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.260" end="00:09:43.220" style="s2">forced to fall on their swords if they</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.570" end="00:09:47.930" style="s2">go in a direction that does not please</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.220" end="00:09:50.000" style="s2">the hierarchy above them so this is a</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.930" end="00:09:51.530" style="s2">puzzle that needs solving and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.000" end="00:09:53.360" style="s2">nothing riding on it but the game yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.530" end="00:09:54.830" style="s2">very much so I guess I mean we can talk</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.360" end="00:09:57.110" style="s2">about this a little bit a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.830" end="00:09:59.660" style="s2">more this doesn&#39;t get so much to how you</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.110" end="00:10:01.340" style="s2">find positions after you&#39;ve gotten a</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.660" end="00:10:02.630" style="s2">degree how do you find positions in</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.340" end="00:10:06.890" style="s2">academia after you&#39;ve gotten a degree</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.630" end="00:10:09.620" style="s2">which is its own set of problems but</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.890" end="00:10:12.170" style="s2">when you&#39;re actually in graduate school</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.620" end="00:10:14.360" style="s2">and if you have an ability to choose</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.170" end="00:10:15.950" style="s2">between advisers and see that some seem</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.360" end="00:10:19.850" style="s2">to be more of the gatekeeping type and</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.950" end="00:10:22.670" style="s2">some less you you can imagine that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.850" end="00:10:26.450" style="s2">actually it would make a lot of sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.670" end="00:10:29.810" style="s2">from a self-interest position to be a</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.450" end="00:10:32.660" style="s2">gatekeeper as an academic and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.810" end="00:10:36.230" style="s2">whole departments tend to be of the sort</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.660" end="00:10:38.150" style="s2">of gatekeeping mindset or not and even</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.230" end="00:10:39.530" style="s2">in those departments that allow graduate</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.150" end="00:10:41.540" style="s2">students more freedom to choose their</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.530" end="00:10:42.830" style="s2">own questions as opposed to slot into a</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.540" end="00:10:45.380" style="s2">space in the lab and ask a question</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.830" end="00:10:47.300" style="s2">that&#39;s handed to you even in those</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.380" end="00:10:48.710" style="s2">departments that tend towards the more</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.300" end="00:10:50.870" style="s2">freedom for graduate students to ask the</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.710" end="00:10:53.360" style="s2">questions and you know sink or swim</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.870" end="00:10:55.040" style="s2">which is certainly the the way that</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.360" end="00:10:58.190" style="s2">Michigan&#39;s biology department was when</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.040" end="00:11:00.050" style="s2">we were there even there you&#39;ll find</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.190" end="00:11:02.950" style="s2">of there would be advisors some of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.050" end="00:11:05.660" style="s2">faculty being more gatekeeping and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.950" end="00:11:08.720" style="s2">really finding a place where you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.660" end="00:11:11.140" style="s2">choosing an advisor who has students who</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.720" end="00:11:13.400" style="s2">are asking all range of questions who</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.140" end="00:11:17.840" style="s2">engages in conversation in which</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.400" end="00:11:20.480" style="s2">disagreement happens and in which the</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.840" end="00:11:23.210" style="s2">entire lab is not dependent on one or</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.480" end="00:11:25.880" style="s2">two or a longitudinal string of large</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.210" end="00:11:27.470" style="s2">grants which are going to be basically</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.880" end="00:11:28.580" style="s2">you&#39;re going to get a reversion to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.470" end="00:11:31.610" style="s2">mean you&#39;re going to get more and more</p>

<p begin="00:11:32.960" end="00:11:36.680" style="s2">grants that require the same kinds of</p>

<p begin="00:11:43.640" end="00:11:48.380" style="s2">becoming harder and harder to find you</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.560" end="00:11:50.090" style="s2">know we both all three of the advisors</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.380" end="00:11:52.430" style="s2">whom we had who you mentioned in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.090" end="00:11:54.260" style="s2">last hour Bob Trevor&#39;s dick Alexander</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.430" end="00:11:56.450" style="s2">and Arnold Kluge were all of those</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.260" end="00:11:58.300" style="s2">things they were they were heterodox and</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.450" end="00:12:00.590" style="s2">encouraging you know they they wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.300" end="00:12:02.270" style="s2">none of them ever would have wanted</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.590" end="00:12:03.350" style="s2">students to simply slot into their own</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.270" end="00:12:05.690" style="s2">research they would have found that</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.350" end="00:12:08.020" style="s2">absurd and anathema and yet it is the</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.690" end="00:12:11.390" style="s2">common thing for graduate advisors</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.020" end="00:12:13.580" style="s2">especially at least in many aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.390" end="00:12:15.830" style="s2">stem I know less about the other parts</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.580" end="00:12:19.340" style="s2">of the Academy yeah one thing you could</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.830" end="00:12:21.920" style="s2">do is you could consider cryogenics you</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.340" end="00:12:23.410" style="s2">could have yourself frozen and then see</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.920" end="00:12:26.210" style="s2">if it&#39;s any better in a hundred years</p>

<p begin="00:12:50.089" end="00:12:53.990" style="s2">asked the question means you must</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.130" end="00:12:56.330" style="s2">understand the basis on which it would</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.990" end="00:12:59.950" style="s2">happen you know there&#39;s always a</p>

<p begin="00:12:59.950" end="00:13:06.470" style="s2">species means about the likelihood of it</p>

<p begin="00:13:08.210" end="00:13:11.410" style="s2">gap it&#39;s kind of as big a gap as you get</p>

<p begin="00:13:11.410" end="00:13:16.810" style="s2">so this is the the I believe the</p>

<p begin="00:13:23.949" end="00:13:27.730" style="s2">would seem about as far as it would seem</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.389" end="00:13:29.709" style="s2">given that Ryan elephants are what we</p>

<p begin="00:14:18.850" end="00:14:23.319" style="s2">remember when we were teaching together</p>

<p begin="00:14:23.319" end="00:14:28.750" style="s2">intelligent young woman in our class</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.880" end="00:14:30.759" style="s2">asked me to explain female orgasm and</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.750" end="00:14:33.459" style="s2">the evolution of lady bits during a</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.759" end="00:14:35.350" style="s2">lecture so I learned in that in that</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.459" end="00:14:37.209" style="s2">insist is that the phrase she used</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.350" end="00:14:39.040" style="s2">yes that lady bit that was the phrase</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.209" end="00:14:40.480" style="s2">and it was very important that I not</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.040" end="00:14:44.199" style="s2">become embarrassed at that moment which</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.480" end="00:14:48.459" style="s2">I didn&#39;t do remember this so there is</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.199" end="00:14:50.199" style="s2">one thing that must govern your actions</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.459" end="00:14:50.730" style="s2">should you ever be asked a question like</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.199" end="00:14:53.560" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.730" end="00:14:56.230" style="s2">should you be male or I guess a gay</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.560" end="00:14:58.059" style="s2">female which is that the answer you</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.230" end="00:14:59.709" style="s2">deliver must leave people with the</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.059" end="00:15:01.540" style="s2">impression they don&#39;t have to understand</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.709" end="00:15:03.220" style="s2">your answer but they must be left with</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.540" end="00:15:05.769" style="s2">the impression that you are something of</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.220" end="00:15:06.970" style="s2">an expert about female orgasm that is</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.769" end="00:15:11.110" style="s2">what they should walk away with a</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.970" end="00:15:13.959" style="s2">question from so to that end let me just</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.110" end="00:15:16.410" style="s2">say that I&#39;m glad I&#39;m what do you answer</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.959" end="00:15:16.410" style="s2">this one</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.860" end="00:15:23.600" style="s2">so female orgasm is not obvious which is</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.540" end="00:15:27.769" style="s2">why people ask</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.600" end="00:15:30.019" style="s2">about it the fact is females by the</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.769" end="00:15:32.959" style="s2">nature of being the limiting sex have a</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.019" end="00:15:35.930" style="s2">very easy time coming by gambits gametes</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.959" end="00:15:39.880" style="s2">if that&#39;s what they need and so why have</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.930" end="00:15:44.630" style="s2">this powerful reward system accompany</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.880" end="00:15:48.829" style="s2">various sexual acts and the answer I am</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.630" end="00:15:51.709" style="s2">almost certain has to do with the nature</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.829" end="00:15:55.490" style="s2">of human pair-bonding and the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.709" end="00:15:57.889" style="s2">the male orgasm has been borrowed by</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.490" end="00:16:00.050" style="s2">selection appended to two females</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.889" end="00:16:03.560" style="s2">slightly differently but appended to</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.050" end="00:16:06.380" style="s2">females to facilitate a kind of sexual</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.560" end="00:16:09.740" style="s2">bonding that results in an increase in</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.380" end="00:16:13.279" style="s2">fitness so in other words females being</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.740" end="00:16:17.269" style="s2">rewarded by sex in this very direct and</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.279" end="00:16:19.639" style="s2">powerful way behave in a fashion that is</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.269" end="00:16:21.230" style="s2">more likely to result in successful</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.639" end="00:16:23.540" style="s2">reproduction that is to say offspring</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.230" end="00:16:25.550" style="s2">that gilliam themselves to reproduce and</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.540" end="00:16:29.839" style="s2">my argument would be that that is</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.550" end="00:16:32.329" style="s2">basically to induce females to engage in</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.839" end="00:16:34.459" style="s2">behavior that is rewarding to male such</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.329" end="00:16:36.949" style="s2">that they stick around that&#39;s some level</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.459" end="00:16:38.540" style="s2">I agree with all that but I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.949" end="00:16:39.860" style="s2">it addresses the question you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.540" end="00:16:42.250" style="s2">have to I just had to leave the</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.860" end="00:16:46.220" style="s2">impression that I knew a lot about it</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.250" end="00:16:48.380" style="s2">yeah but I I think as much as that was</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.220" end="00:16:51.860" style="s2">actually a great answer to the question</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.380" end="00:16:53.569" style="s2">of his female orgasm adaptive yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.860" end="00:16:55.579" style="s2">but this question is specifically about</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.569" end="00:16:57.769" style="s2">multiple orgasms which is the part of</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.579" end="00:17:00.139" style="s2">the question where I&#39;m like I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.769" end="00:17:04.400" style="s2">actually what to say here yes adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.139" end="00:17:07.280" style="s2">but but why and I don&#39;t have anything in</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.400" end="00:17:09.409" style="s2">particular on that um for one thing this</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.280" end="00:17:11.689" style="s2">is an incentive to females but it is</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.409" end="00:17:14.120" style="s2">also an incentive to males in other</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.689" end="00:17:15.709" style="s2">words to the extent that I mean male</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.120" end="00:17:18.559" style="s2">orgasm and female orgasm are very</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.709" end="00:17:20.959" style="s2">different in the sense that male orgasm</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.559" end="00:17:24.079" style="s2">rather famously changes one&#39;s frame of</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.959" end="00:17:25.730" style="s2">mind almost instantaneously the fact</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.079" end="00:17:26.900" style="s2">that it doesn&#39;t do that for women and</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.730" end="00:17:28.459" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying it doesn&#39;t do it at all</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.900" end="00:17:30.260" style="s2">but the fact that there could</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.459" end="00:17:35.350" style="s2">potentially be other orgasms down the</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.260" end="00:17:36.940" style="s2">line keeps male attention focused and</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.350" end="00:17:39.310" style="s2">again the pole</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.940" end="00:17:42.310" style="s2">is going to be the bond is actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.310" end="00:17:45.120" style="s2">vital to the fitness of both parties and</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.310" end="00:17:47.500" style="s2">therefore each one is structured to</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.120" end="00:17:50.560" style="s2">deliver the other what is needed in</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.500" end="00:17:53.650" style="s2">order to keep them engaged okay that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.560" end="00:17:55.210" style="s2">good keeps keeps the mill focused twenty</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.650" end="00:17:57.970" style="s2">forty years ago that would have been</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.210" end="00:18:00.820" style="s2">described simply as mate guarding but it</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.970" end="00:18:04.260" style="s2">does the same trick it effectively keeps</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.820" end="00:18:08.020" style="s2">you keeps you close potentially and and</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.260" end="00:18:10.390" style="s2">ready to go forward to potentially even</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.020" end="00:18:11.140" style="s2">non sexual behavior but it can go to</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.390" end="00:18:13.180" style="s2">sexual again</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.140" end="00:18:14.530" style="s2">yeah and for those of you interested in</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.180" end="00:18:16.840" style="s2">this style of question I would just</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.530" end="00:18:19.120" style="s2">simply point out there are a whole set</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.840" end="00:18:22.360" style="s2">of features of human sex and sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.120" end="00:18:24.430" style="s2">that are utterly unique and some of them</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.360" end="00:18:28.180" style="s2">that are mostly unique having sex when</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.430" end="00:18:32.500" style="s2">not fertile female orgasm concealment of</p>

<p begin="00:18:40.810" end="00:18:44.110" style="s2">pieces don&#39;t fit together in a way and</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.520" end="00:18:46.750" style="s2">it&#39;s completely obvious why we&#39;re built</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.110" end="00:18:48.850" style="s2">this way but it is a set of questions</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.750" end="00:18:52.150" style="s2">that is well worth spending some time</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.850" end="00:18:58.060" style="s2">thinking about and don&#39;t treat sex</p>

<p begin="00:20:36.590" end="00:20:39.410" style="s2">of two paths and they will have</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.000" end="00:20:41.660" style="s2">different outcomes so there&#39;s an</p>

<p begin="00:20:41.660" end="00:20:46.340" style="s2">and then there&#39;s the reality of what it</p>

<p begin="00:20:51.410" end="00:20:57.770" style="s2">question about precaution so obviously</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.210" end="00:21:00.440" style="s2">there are costs both ways and obviously</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.770" end="00:21:01.460" style="s2">we don&#39;t end driving just because it</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.440" end="00:21:03.770" style="s2">would save lives</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.460" end="00:21:05.530" style="s2">we decide that a certain number of lives</p>

<p begin="00:21:05.530" end="00:21:09.560" style="s2">driving so by analogy certainly there is</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.090" end="00:21:11.990" style="s2">a certain number of lives that we would</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.560" end="00:21:16.690" style="s2">be willing to lose not to have to go on</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.990" end="00:21:20.060" style="s2">lockdown but presumably that number is</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.690" end="00:21:22.100" style="s2">something we can discuss and that the</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.060" end="00:21:25.220" style="s2">tens of thousands of deaths that we look</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.100" end="00:21:28.460" style="s2">like that we appear to be staring at and</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.220" end="00:21:30.620" style="s2">there is substantial data now about what</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.460" end="00:21:33.080" style="s2">results from the relaxation of lockdowns</p>

<p begin="00:21:34.520" end="00:21:38.060" style="s2">been less stringent so we do have a lot</p>

<p begin="00:21:38.060" end="00:21:47.950" style="s2">I have seen so far does suggest that</p>

<p begin="00:22:12.980" end="00:22:17.450" style="s2">happening but it does need to be in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.470" end="00:22:19.880" style="s2">conversation about whether or not to do</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.450" end="00:22:21.710" style="s2">this can we slow this thing down by</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.880" end="00:22:24.050" style="s2">giving it less territory in which to</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.710" end="00:22:26.990" style="s2">experiment long enough that we can get</p>

<p begin="00:22:26.990" end="00:22:32.030" style="s2">is recurrent and comes back to people</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.440" end="00:22:33.680" style="s2">who&#39;ve been sick again and again over</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.030" end="00:22:35.600" style="s2">their lives if you knew that to be the</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.680" end="00:22:37.250" style="s2">case you would understand that it was</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.600" end="00:22:38.480" style="s2">much more important that we prevent</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.250" end="00:22:39.980" style="s2">people from getting sick because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.480" end="00:22:41.720" style="s2">not like most of these people get sick</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.980" end="00:22:43.220" style="s2">and they get better they get sick and</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.720" end="00:22:44.960" style="s2">then maybe they get sick again and they</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.220" end="00:22:46.310" style="s2">keep spreading it now I&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.960" end="00:22:48.020" style="s2">that that&#39;s happening I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.310" end="00:22:50.150" style="s2">probably not happening but until we know</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.020" end="00:22:52.640" style="s2">for sure that it&#39;s not happening it</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.150" end="00:22:54.980" style="s2">justifies extra caution and I think a</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.640" end="00:22:57.560" style="s2">lot of these things that we&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.980" end="00:23:00.170" style="s2">at are the same structure where the</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.560" end="00:23:02.630" style="s2">unknowns are still substantial and at</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.170" end="00:23:04.340" style="s2">the moment we have this thing somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.630" end="00:23:06.830" style="s2">limited we could have done a lot better</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.340" end="00:23:08.570" style="s2">if we&#39;ve gotten on earlier and had been</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.830" end="00:23:10.310" style="s2">more stringent we could have potentially</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.570" end="00:23:13.040" style="s2">stamped it out in a matter of weeks if</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.310" end="00:23:15.170" style="s2">we had gone at it aggressively and</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.040" end="00:23:18.800" style="s2">rapidly instead it took us long enough</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.170" end="00:23:20.390" style="s2">that it escaped the possibility so those</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.800" end="00:23:22.790" style="s2">are the things we&#39;re playing with and I</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.390" end="00:23:25.340" style="s2">think when you hear from those of us who</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.790" end="00:23:26.570" style="s2">think that stringent measures are</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.340" end="00:23:30.920" style="s2">necessary these are some of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.570" end="00:23:32.290" style="s2">parameters we&#39;re talking about that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.920" end="00:23:34.670" style="s2">great</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.290" end="00:23:36.620" style="s2">what are your leading hypotheses on the</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.670" end="00:23:38.720" style="s2">mechanism of consciousness that is the</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.620" end="00:23:40.250" style="s2">hard problem of consciousness please</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.720" end="00:23:43.580" style="s2">discuss your theory with Sam and Annika</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.250" end="00:23:45.710" style="s2">Harris and is consciousness binary on or</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.580" end="00:23:49.220" style="s2">off or is it made of parts or layers I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.710" end="00:23:55.370" style="s2">serious but he&#39;s included an emoji</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.220" end="00:23:59.750" style="s2">oh god that&#39;s confusing well I think I</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.370" end="00:24:00.890" style="s2">think we can direct people to - what</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.750" end="00:24:03.200" style="s2">we&#39;ve written that&#39;s not published yet</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.890" end="00:24:06.020" style="s2">but also the talk that we gave at</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.200" end="00:24:08.300" style="s2">Princeton a couple weeks ago now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.020" end="00:24:11.679" style="s2">available online at the James Madison</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.300" end="00:24:11.679" style="s2">program site and</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.710" end="00:24:17.020" style="s2">it&#39;s so that bat will get at the second</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.340" end="00:24:18.940" style="s2">third of the question which is his</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.020" end="00:24:22.330" style="s2">conscious binary or is it made of parts</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.940" end="00:24:23.740" style="s2">and layers and I I suspect although I</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.330" end="00:24:27.070" style="s2">don&#39;t know if we&#39;ve exactly talked about</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.740" end="00:24:28.690" style="s2">this that there is that by anyway I</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.070" end="00:24:32.470" style="s2">imagine that there is a sort of a moment</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.690" end="00:24:34.659" style="s2">of illuminating right but then beyond</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.470" end="00:24:37.510" style="s2">that it&#39;s very much it very much scales</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.659" end="00:24:39.250" style="s2">with the complexity of the brain and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.510" end="00:24:40.750" style="s2">social system and the developmental</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.250" end="00:24:42.159" style="s2">history and the length of childhood and</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.750" end="00:24:45.010" style="s2">a number of generations living together</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.159" end="00:24:47.669" style="s2">in all of this so that it&#39;s not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.010" end="00:24:51.340" style="s2">binary and that you have it or you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.669" end="00:24:53.890" style="s2">except yes probably most organisms don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.340" end="00:24:57.010" style="s2">at all but then the degree to which you</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.890" end="00:24:59.320" style="s2">can be conscious is largely explanatory</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.010" end="00:25:00.399" style="s2">in terms of whether or not you end up</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.320" end="00:25:02.440" style="s2">being able to for instance have</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.399" end="00:25:04.720" style="s2">conversations like this and then the</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.440" end="00:25:06.279" style="s2">mechanism is a different one and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.720" end="00:25:10.390" style="s2">we already sort of covered it with the</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.279" end="00:25:12.309" style="s2">first question yeah I&#39;d say we are not</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.390" end="00:25:14.080" style="s2">believers that there is a hard problem</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.309" end="00:25:16.480" style="s2">the hard problem is taken to have two</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.080" end="00:25:19.960" style="s2">parts one is what&#39;s it for or the other</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.480" end="00:25:22.480" style="s2">is how does it work what&#39;s it for seems</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.960" end="00:25:25.149" style="s2">more tractable and our answer involves</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.480" end="00:25:27.399" style="s2">consciousness being a necessary layer</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.149" end="00:25:30.669" style="s2">constructed in the mind in order to</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.399" end="00:25:32.770" style="s2">understand what another mind is saying</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.669" end="00:25:34.539" style="s2">thinking feeling etc and so there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.770" end="00:25:36.279" style="s2">emergent consciousness between two</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.539" end="00:25:39.100" style="s2">individuals that is necessary for them</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.279" end="00:25:40.890" style="s2">to plug their minds into each other in</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.100" end="00:25:43.630" style="s2">order to parallel process a problem</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.890" end="00:25:44.980" style="s2">which results in higher quality answers</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.630" end="00:25:47.049" style="s2">than the two Minds working separately</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.980" end="00:25:49.899" style="s2">would be able to accomplish how does it</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.049" end="00:25:51.970" style="s2">work obviously that&#39;s a technically</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.899" end="00:25:55.059" style="s2">tougher issue but is it so tough then</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.970" end="00:25:56.950" style="s2">it&#39;s not going to yield two techniques</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.059" end="00:25:58.570" style="s2">that study neurological phenomena I</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.950" end="00:25:59.799" style="s2">don&#39;t see the slightest bit of evidence</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.570" end="00:26:01.600" style="s2">for that</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.799" end="00:26:04.720" style="s2">it&#39;s a phenomenon of the brain and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.600" end="00:26:07.179" style="s2">a marvelous one is it you know it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.720" end="00:26:08.590" style="s2">gonna be a threshold right we can define</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.179" end="00:26:10.750" style="s2">a threshold and we can say is this</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.590" end="00:26:12.460" style="s2">animal across it or not but the fact is</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.750" end="00:26:14.950" style="s2">even in your own consciousness you can</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.460" end="00:26:16.510" style="s2">feel that there are things of which you</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.950" end="00:26:18.070" style="s2">are highly conscious things of which you</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.510" end="00:26:19.809" style="s2">are not conscious at all and things that</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.070" end="00:26:22.630" style="s2">hover somewhere in between and that you</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.809" end="00:26:24.850" style="s2">can push that boundary around at will by</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.630" end="00:26:26.860" style="s2">concentrating on things or ignoring them</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.850" end="00:26:28.600" style="s2">whatever you do so there&#39;s no reason to</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.860" end="00:26:30.610" style="s2">expect that that&#39;s not an analog for the</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.600" end="00:26:32.230" style="s2">way this is distributed in nature but</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.610" end="00:26:34.450" style="s2">you would argue would you not that there</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.230" end="00:26:36.970" style="s2">are certainly organisms that have no</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.450" end="00:26:41.080" style="s2">consciousness oh yeah so that does</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.970" end="00:26:44.380" style="s2">suggest a threshold of sorts but but not</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.080" end="00:26:46.060" style="s2">one beyond which it&#39;s really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.380" end="00:26:48.040" style="s2">to talk about do you have it do you not</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.060" end="00:26:50.710" style="s2">like there&#39;s some level of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.040" end="00:26:53.050" style="s2">and it&#39;s highly variable within space</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.710" end="00:26:56.080" style="s2">and time both at the micro and macro</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.050" end="00:26:59.440" style="s2">level I mean sort of seems to me like</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.080" end="00:27:01.630" style="s2">you know vascularization or something</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.440" end="00:27:03.430" style="s2">mmm yep there gonna be some entities</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.630" end="00:27:06.010" style="s2">without any and then there&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.430" end="00:27:08.170" style="s2">every gradation up to the maximum amount</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.010" end="00:27:10.000" style="s2">and that maximum amount is probably not</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.170" end="00:27:12.340" style="s2">a theoretical maximum is just what we</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.000" end="00:27:14.710" style="s2">happen to have the maximum of and so my</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.340" end="00:27:18.310" style="s2">guess is consciousness is like that and</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.710" end="00:27:20.890" style="s2">you know a spruce tree isn&#39;t gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.310" end="00:27:23.410" style="s2">any and you know a spider probably</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.890" end="00:27:26.950" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have any and probably an octopus</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.410" end="00:27:30.340" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have any smart as it is a cat</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.950" end="00:27:31.780" style="s2">has a bit a dog has a lot you know and</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.340" end="00:27:34.260" style="s2">people have the kind of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.780" end="00:27:36.940" style="s2">you get when it comes packaged with</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.260" end="00:27:40.380" style="s2">linguistic capacity which is you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.940" end="00:27:44.560" style="s2">leaps and bounds beyond anything else</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.380" end="00:27:46.030" style="s2">good ok questions from echo the</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.560" end="00:27:48.610" style="s2">rationality rules video that you</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.030" end="00:27:50.280" style="s2">referenced Brett said that homeopathy is</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.610" end="00:27:52.900" style="s2">literally false metaphorically true</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.280" end="00:27:54.700" style="s2">sounds conclusion driven can you give</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.900" end="00:27:57.640" style="s2">your take on homeopathy and how can its</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.700" end="00:28:00.520" style="s2">mechanism be compared to vaccines and it</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.640" end="00:28:03.790" style="s2">Kopacz a lot into her questions wait a</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.520" end="00:28:08.470" style="s2">second I am Not sure that I interpreted</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.790" end="00:28:12.190" style="s2">the video to say the same thing was</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.470" end="00:28:14.770" style="s2">homeopathy not described as placebo like</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.190" end="00:28:16.420" style="s2">in that video and in that video he did I</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.770" end="00:28:18.610" style="s2">don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen the video yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.420" end="00:28:21.520" style="s2">he unpacked metaphorical truth and he</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.610" end="00:28:23.530" style="s2">goes through the Peterson Harris debates</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.520" end="00:28:25.810" style="s2">and you know I was very pleased that he</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.530" end="00:28:28.450" style="s2">said I had come closest to rescuing the</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.810" end="00:28:32.200" style="s2">baby from the bath water with</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.450" end="00:28:34.330" style="s2">metaphorical truth anyway his point was</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.200" end="00:28:36.550" style="s2">and actually I was thinking about doing</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.330" end="00:28:38.410" style="s2">a response his point was Brett seems to</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.550" end="00:28:40.990" style="s2">speak very carefully</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.410" end="00:28:42.850" style="s2">about behaving as if something is true</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.990" end="00:28:46.120" style="s2">rather than believing that it is true</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.850" end="00:28:48.190" style="s2">because he claims I am avoiding the trap</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.120" end="00:28:50.940" style="s2">that would be set for me with placebos</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.190" end="00:28:53.290" style="s2">now placebos are a topic that is</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.940" end="00:28:55.120" style="s2">absolutely deserving of an exploration</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.290" end="00:28:57.520" style="s2">it&#39;s not what you think it is but</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.120" end="00:28:59.170" style="s2">nonetheless I liked his conjecture I</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.520" end="00:29:00.820" style="s2">wasn&#39;t a hundred percent sure that I was</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.170" end="00:29:03.340" style="s2">consciously avoiding the trap of</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.820" end="00:29:05.110" style="s2">placebos but I am aware that that that</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.340" end="00:29:08.470" style="s2">phrasing this carefully does avoid a</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.110" end="00:29:11.500" style="s2">whole spectrum of bad fates and so</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.470" end="00:29:13.390" style="s2">anyway to make a long story short I am</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.500" end="00:29:15.310" style="s2">curious whether I have misunderstood</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.390" end="00:29:18.970" style="s2">what he said about homeopathy or you did</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.310" end="00:29:22.810" style="s2">I will have to go back and look but he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.970" end="00:29:26.320" style="s2">right my rubric for presenting</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.810" end="00:29:29.380" style="s2">metaphorical truth does negate the</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.320" end="00:29:30.880" style="s2">question of the importance of placebos</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.380" end="00:29:32.920" style="s2">because it&#39;s a question of behavior not</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.880" end="00:29:35.140" style="s2">belief the way I have phrased it mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.920" end="00:29:37.030" style="s2">good behavior not belief and then the</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.140" end="00:29:39.640" style="s2">end of that first question from Ecco is</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.030" end="00:29:41.410" style="s2">how can the mechanism of homeopathy be</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.640" end="00:29:43.390" style="s2">compared to vaccines and I would say to</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.410" end="00:29:46.420" style="s2">first pass there doesn&#39;t appear to be a</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.390" end="00:29:49.570" style="s2">mechanism of homeopathy it is entirely</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.420" end="00:29:51.490" style="s2">belief and to whatever degree that</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.570" end="00:29:54.400" style="s2">belief can change outcomes in some</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.490" end="00:29:56.980" style="s2">sectors it therefore has the possibility</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.400" end="00:30:00.820" style="s2">of sometimes having an effect but</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.980" end="00:30:04.270" style="s2">vaccines are actual biological agents</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.820" end="00:30:06.100" style="s2">that are being used to get your immune</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.270" end="00:30:08.290" style="s2">system to respond on your behalf and</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.100" end="00:30:11.520" style="s2">homeopathy is doing nothing of the sort</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.290" end="00:30:15.190" style="s2">yeah the vaccines take fragments of</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.520" end="00:30:17.920" style="s2">something or inactivated viruses and</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.190" end="00:30:19.600" style="s2">they inject them into your system where</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.920" end="00:30:21.460" style="s2">it wrecked your system recognizes them</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.600" end="00:30:24.250" style="s2">as hostile and it learns to fight them</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.460" end="00:30:27.340" style="s2">in their enfeebled or non viable form</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.250" end="00:30:28.630" style="s2">then it&#39;s better prepared when you are</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.340" end="00:30:30.820" style="s2">challenged with an actual pathogen</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.630" end="00:30:32.170" style="s2">rather likely dead viruses that are</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.820" end="00:30:34.330" style="s2">being shed by the people who were</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.170" end="00:30:37.980" style="s2">infected the Theodore Roosevelt right</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.330" end="00:30:40.570" style="s2">yes sorry come on no that&#39;s it okay okay</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.980" end="00:30:43.060" style="s2">second question from echos second</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.570" end="00:30:45.490" style="s2">questions you say that values are</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.060" end="00:30:47.980" style="s2">discovered if we agree to kill bed bugs</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.490" end="00:30:51.260" style="s2">because of traumatic insemination not</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.980" end="00:30:53.660" style="s2">sure that&#39;s the phrase intended here but</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.260" end="00:30:54.830" style="s2">it is okay okay if we agree to kill</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.660" end="00:30:57.050" style="s2">bedbugs because of traumatic</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.830" end="00:31:00.260" style="s2">insemination we agree humans hold better</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.050" end="00:31:02.720" style="s2">values say bedbugs don&#39;t feel pain is</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.260" end="00:31:03.800" style="s2">pain a prerequisite for bonding and</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.720" end="00:31:07.760" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.800" end="00:31:10.390" style="s2">okay echo some humans have better values</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.760" end="00:31:12.530" style="s2">than bedbugs</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.390" end="00:31:18.220" style="s2">all right you sure you&#39;re not drinking</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.530" end="00:31:18.220" style="s2">I have not its water</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.430" end="00:31:25.310" style="s2">yeah so I want to understand this</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.110" end="00:31:30.160" style="s2">question first of all I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.310" end="00:31:34.130" style="s2">conflation of things several things</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.160" end="00:31:36.380" style="s2">values our values discovered I certainly</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.130" end="00:31:39.110" style="s2">don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever said that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.380" end="00:31:42.200" style="s2">talked about the need to navigate to</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.110" end="00:31:44.450" style="s2">superior locations superior being</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.200" end="00:31:46.790" style="s2">defined by an agreement on the values</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.450" end="00:31:49.190" style="s2">that we are trying to reach what would</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.790" end="00:31:51.650" style="s2">be the alternative discovered versus</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.190" end="00:31:52.730" style="s2">creative well like those that they were</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.650" end="00:31:55.790" style="s2">always there and they&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.730" end="00:31:58.490" style="s2">discovered as opposed to created by</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.790" end="00:32:00.920" style="s2">human I think this is an is odd if you I</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.490" end="00:32:03.200" style="s2">think there are those for example Sam</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.920" end="00:32:06.320" style="s2">Harris who I think sets a high bar in</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.200" end="00:32:09.250" style="s2">general people who believe you can</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.320" end="00:32:12.920" style="s2">derive the art from the is or limbs</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.250" end="00:32:15.740" style="s2">obviously Sam isn&#39;t I don&#39;t think he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.920" end="00:32:22.850" style="s2">right as I&#39;ve told him but nonetheless</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.740" end="00:32:26.750" style="s2">you could deduce values only we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.850" end="00:32:29.570" style="s2">properly connected to is my point would</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.750" end="00:32:33.470" style="s2">be why bother if you take people</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.570" end="00:32:35.270" style="s2">reasonable people and you query them</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.470" end="00:32:36.770" style="s2">about their values what you will find</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.270" end="00:32:39.650" style="s2">and I&#39;ve done this experiment many times</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.770" end="00:32:43.670" style="s2">is that in general most people at least</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.650" end="00:32:45.950" style="s2">in the West share a large number of</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.670" end="00:32:47.660" style="s2">values what they don&#39;t share is the</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.950" end="00:32:50.630" style="s2">ordering of them that is to say their</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.660" end="00:32:52.550" style="s2">priority relative to each other or their</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.630" end="00:32:54.710" style="s2">assessment of where we are as a society</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.550" end="00:32:57.170" style="s2">with respect to realizing those values</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.710" end="00:32:59.640" style="s2">we differ over that but in general what</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.170" end="00:33:02.490" style="s2">we all want is pretty similar</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.640" end="00:33:04.560" style="s2">and so anyway you don&#39;t have to derive</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.490" end="00:33:07.340" style="s2">this from an is it probably isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.560" end="00:33:09.800" style="s2">possible to derive it from and is and</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.340" end="00:33:13.770" style="s2">just not sure there&#39;s any value in it</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.800" end="00:33:16.950" style="s2">so the question then is we should kill</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.770" end="00:33:19.950" style="s2">bedbugs because they infest your house</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.950" end="00:33:22.770" style="s2">in your bed and they cause a terrible</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.950" end="00:33:25.980" style="s2">rash that&#39;s good enough reason for me</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.770" end="00:33:27.600" style="s2">not because their values are bad in fact</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.980" end="00:33:29.220" style="s2">I can pretty much guarantee you they</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.600" end="00:33:31.050" style="s2">don&#39;t have values they just they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.220" end="00:33:33.210" style="s2">little robots that are programmed to do</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.050" end="00:33:35.730" style="s2">their bedbug thing as with so many of</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.210" end="00:33:38.130" style="s2">echos questions there&#39;s we could unpack</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.730" end="00:33:41.160" style="s2">it it I think the question itself is so</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.130" end="00:33:43.770" style="s2">fractal it has many many layers yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.160" end="00:33:45.480" style="s2">maybe we will move on in order to get</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.770" end="00:33:50.520" style="s2">through a few more of these questions so</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.480" end="00:33:53.070" style="s2">the last thing echo says is bed bugs</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.520" end="00:33:56.880" style="s2">don&#39;t feel pain is pain a prerequisite</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.070" end="00:33:57.960" style="s2">to bonding and consciousness I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.880" end="00:34:00.470" style="s2">know if it&#39;s a prerequisite to</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.960" end="00:34:00.470" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.860" end="00:34:07.800" style="s2">but I would say but it always does</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.620" end="00:34:09.810" style="s2">predate it in evolutions of</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.800" end="00:34:10.200" style="s2">consciousness that we see on this planet</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.810" end="00:34:12.690" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.200" end="00:34:14.850" style="s2">on the other hand the things that you</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.690" end="00:34:15.960" style="s2">have listed that contribute to the</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.850" end="00:34:17.490" style="s2">likelihood of the evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.960" end="00:34:20.490" style="s2">consciousness are all things that would</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.490" end="00:34:22.200" style="s2">require pain to keep you out of damaging</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.490" end="00:34:24.179" style="s2">trouble which would require would</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.200" end="00:34:26.010" style="s2">suggest therefore that it is that pain</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.179" end="00:34:27.270" style="s2">is a prerequisite for consciousness I</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.010" end="00:34:29.760" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t call it a prerequisite I would</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.270" end="00:34:32.520" style="s2">say it always precedes it you know in</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.760" end="00:34:36.030" style="s2">the same way yeah so um you know you</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.520" end="00:34:38.690" style="s2">have to mm-hmm you have to be born to</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.030" end="00:34:41.370" style="s2">feel pain I guess but it you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.690" end="00:34:43.140" style="s2">prerequisites kind of a it&#39;s a it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.370" end="00:34:45.179" style="s2">a logical prerequisite as far as I know</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.140" end="00:34:48.840" style="s2">yeah but I would say there is an</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.179" end="00:34:52.710" style="s2">argument to be made that pain or some</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.840" end="00:34:55.560" style="s2">analog of it is a prerequisite to</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.710" end="00:34:57.720" style="s2">meaning I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if that</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.560" end="00:34:58.950" style="s2">was a fair climber so anyway don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.720" end="00:35:00.830" style="s2">if that&#39;s what you&#39;re after okay that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.950" end="00:35:03.060" style="s2">good I like that</p>

<p begin="00:35:38.900" end="00:35:43.370" style="s2">lot of the arguments and that leads you</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.390" end="00:35:45.250" style="s2">to suggest that maybe it&#39;s it&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.370" end="00:35:49.130" style="s2">something right but when you picked a</p>

<p begin="00:36:20.750" end="00:36:24.620" style="s2">right article I think this is the</p>

<p begin="00:36:28.250" end="00:36:37.190" style="s2">the Czar&#39;s Cove 2 would show hallmarks</p>

<p begin="00:36:57.380" end="00:37:01.910" style="s2">evidence but this is actually a good</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.240" end="00:37:04.580" style="s2">maybe this is what you&#39;re looking for to</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.910" end="00:37:07.100" style="s2">say that this virus shows some evidence</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.580" end="00:37:09.530" style="s2">of genetic manipulation is not to say</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.100" end="00:37:13.250" style="s2">that the evidence is conclusive it is to</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.530" end="00:37:14.930" style="s2">say some evidence so I think we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.250" end="00:37:16.670" style="s2">tripping over this those of us who&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.930" end="00:37:19.220" style="s2">been discussing this in public which is</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.670" end="00:37:21.140" style="s2">to say people say there&#39;s no evidence of</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.220" end="00:37:22.670" style="s2">and that&#39;s just not true there&#39;s lots of</p>

<p begin="00:37:22.670" end="00:37:26.320" style="s2">point in the same direction</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.430" end="00:37:28.150" style="s2">so we have to be very careful and we</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.320" end="00:37:30.010" style="s2">should frankly be generous with each</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.150" end="00:37:31.270" style="s2">other because we all have an interest in</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.010" end="00:37:33.970" style="s2">figuring out where this thing came from</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.270" end="00:37:37.630" style="s2">we do whether you realize it or not we</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.970" end="00:37:40.950" style="s2">just simply do so anyway yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.630" end="00:37:44.140" style="s2">that paper is full of flaws and I</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.950" end="00:37:45.790" style="s2">believe soon we will explore them more</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.140" end="00:37:47.560" style="s2">deeply maybe not with respect to that</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.790" end="00:37:52.030" style="s2">paper itself but the general arguments</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.560" end="00:37:54.490" style="s2">it&#39;s its marshalling next question dum</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.030" end="00:37:56.530" style="s2">necessary plumber here is it possible</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.490" end="00:38:00.310" style="s2">for mosquitos to be a vector for covin I</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.530" end="00:38:05.140" style="s2">want to start by addressing the lay up</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.310" end="00:38:09.040" style="s2">layout lay up set up face question dum</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.140" end="00:38:12.190" style="s2">necessary plumber I assume that that dum</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.040" end="00:38:14.710" style="s2">is included here because much of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.190" end="00:38:17.800" style="s2">white-collar world imagines that those</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.710" end="00:38:20.080" style="s2">who do real work that has manifestations</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.800" end="00:38:21.760" style="s2">in the physical world art as bright as</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.080" end="00:38:23.920" style="s2">those who sit behind desks and work in</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.760" end="00:38:26.110" style="s2">cubicles and such and this is of course</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.920" end="00:38:28.240" style="s2">a position that we have argued against</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.110" end="00:38:32.260" style="s2">stringently forever</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.240" end="00:38:33.820" style="s2">not not merely because so many of our</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.260" end="00:38:36.670" style="s2">most brilliant students themselves came</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.820" end="00:38:39.670" style="s2">from the trades often and not merely</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.670" end="00:38:42.700" style="s2">because we both do physical work</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.670" end="00:38:45.640" style="s2">ourselves and have learned sometimes the</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.700" end="00:38:47.860" style="s2">hard way how difficult much of it is and</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.640" end="00:38:49.750" style="s2">how valuable it is and how doing work</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.860" end="00:38:51.580" style="s2">that has a manifestation of the physical</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.750" end="00:38:53.590" style="s2">world means it&#39;s not game ax bull and</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.580" end="00:38:54.640" style="s2">therefore you actually know at the end</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.590" end="00:38:56.440" style="s2">of it whether or not you&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.640" end="00:38:57.610" style="s2">something right or wrong whereas so much</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.440" end="00:38:59.110" style="s2">of the work that&#39;s passing for</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.610" end="00:39:01.180" style="s2">intellectual work or at least</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.110" end="00:39:03.250" style="s2">white-collar work now has no such</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.180" end="00:39:05.550" style="s2">outcome and so you just can&#39;t tell and</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.250" end="00:39:07.570" style="s2">so those people are more likely to</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.550" end="00:39:08.860" style="s2">potentially fool themselves more and</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.570" end="00:39:11.290" style="s2">more and more you can&#39;t do that if</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.860" end="00:39:13.690" style="s2">you&#39;re a plumber so let me just start by</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.290" end="00:39:14.890" style="s2">start by addressing the idea of a dumb</p>

<p begin="00:39:16.510" end="00:39:23.470" style="s2">is it possible for mosquitoes to be a</p>

<p begin="00:40:28.199" end="00:40:32.289" style="s2">obsessed with this question the first</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.579" end="00:40:34.390" style="s2">thing I would want to do just figure out</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.289" end="00:40:36.849" style="s2">whether any coronavirus is being</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.390" end="00:40:40.599" style="s2">vectored this way and I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.849" end="00:40:42.999" style="s2">there&#39;s certainly so yellow fever is an</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.599" end="00:40:44.650" style="s2">RNA virus vector by mosquitos so RNA</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.999" end="00:40:48.459" style="s2">virus yes but yellow fever isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.650" end="00:40:50.709" style="s2">corona virus so I would love to know are</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.459" end="00:40:52.539" style="s2">there any known corona viruses vector by</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.709" end="00:40:54.219" style="s2">mosquito if the answer is no then the</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.539" end="00:40:57.549" style="s2">answer to your question is probably not</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.219" end="00:40:59.919" style="s2">if the answer is yes then the answer to</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.549" end="00:41:01.209" style="s2">your question is could be let&#39;s not give</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.919" end="00:41:01.719" style="s2">them the opportunity to evolve that</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.209" end="00:41:07.839" style="s2">trick</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.719" end="00:41:09.009" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s not please here&#39;s a request</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.839" end="00:41:10.269" style="s2">for us to look at something that we</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.009" end="00:41:13.209" style="s2">haven&#39;t seen yet but I&#39;ll just read it</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.269" end="00:41:15.309" style="s2">please look at polar 50 forties</p>

<p begin="00:41:20.079" end="00:41:25.449" style="s2">particularly relevant okay are you</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.140" end="00:41:27.039" style="s2">familiar with the danger model or danger</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.449" end="00:41:28.959" style="s2">I don&#39;t know which it is in immunology</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.039" end="00:41:31.869" style="s2">which says right there that I at least</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.959" end="00:41:34.089" style="s2">don&#39;t know it NIH has a great videocast</p>

<p begin="00:41:34.089" end="00:41:38.949" style="s2">or may not be related to this you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.499" end="00:41:40.989" style="s2">that name um I believe I saw some very</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.949" end="00:41:45.729" style="s2">good stuff I couldn&#39;t swear that was the</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.989" end="00:41:48.220" style="s2">name but I think so um the &#39;danger model</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.729" end="00:41:49.840" style="s2">so here&#39;s the problem as I took</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.220" end="00:41:56.260" style="s2">you know biology at the University of</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.840" end="00:42:01.180" style="s2">Pennsylvania back in 1991 87 baby right</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.260" end="00:42:04.359" style="s2">yeah baby you know your freshman it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.180" end="00:42:05.980" style="s2">great course did I learn this model that</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.359" end="00:42:07.359" style="s2">the model exists yet and have I</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.980" end="00:42:09.700" style="s2">forgotten that that&#39;s the name of it I</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.359" end="00:42:11.770" style="s2">don&#39;t know at least don&#39;t know it by</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.700" end="00:42:13.570" style="s2">that name yep if it&#39;s new then probably</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.770" end="00:42:14.950" style="s2">we don&#39;t know it if it&#39;s old then</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.570" end="00:42:16.060" style="s2">probably I knew it but I forgotten</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.950" end="00:42:24.630" style="s2">that&#39;s the name yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.060" end="00:42:24.630" style="s2">sorry what time are we at suck 42 okay</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.770" end="00:42:29.820" style="s2">let&#39;s just we got two more questions</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.130" end="00:42:34.300" style="s2">and then I&#39;ll switch we got a few more</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.960" end="00:42:35.650" style="s2">but let&#39;s just do the next two here have</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.300" end="00:42:37.780" style="s2">you read any of the work done by David</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.650" end="00:42:39.849" style="s2">Deutsch and his take on pop Aryan</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.780" end="00:42:41.619" style="s2">epistemology regardless do you think</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.849" end="00:42:44.340" style="s2">popper had it right knowledge through</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.619" end="00:42:46.630" style="s2">conjecture and criticism not empiricism</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.340" end="00:42:47.950" style="s2">that&#39;s an interesting characterization</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.630" end="00:42:49.630" style="s2">of popper that&#39;s not how I would have</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.950" end="00:42:51.520" style="s2">characterized it I think I know what is</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.630" end="00:42:54.250" style="s2">being alluded to here but it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.520" end="00:42:57.160" style="s2">not the part of popper that we were</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.250" end="00:42:59.020" style="s2">focused on through you know Clube and</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.160" end="00:43:00.700" style="s2">such and epistemology when we were in</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.020" end="00:43:03.160" style="s2">graduate school yeah and I certainly</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.700" end="00:43:06.580" style="s2">never heard in the long discussions that</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.160" end="00:43:10.180" style="s2">we had about popper and falsification</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.580" end="00:43:13.119" style="s2">and such a desire to throw out</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.180" end="00:43:14.890" style="s2">empiricism but I don&#39;t know can you</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.119" end="00:43:20.170" style="s2">could you go further with us yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.890" end="00:43:22.660" style="s2">I would say a popper had it at least</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.170" end="00:43:24.930" style="s2">partly right falsification is clearly a</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.660" end="00:43:27.730" style="s2">huge step in the right direction</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.930" end="00:43:29.650" style="s2">I would doubt he had it completely right</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.730" end="00:43:31.930" style="s2">and he certainly didn&#39;t all along one of</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.650" end="00:43:34.930" style="s2">the most important things and the reason</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.930" end="00:43:36.970" style="s2">that he was sort of contentious in our</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.930" end="00:43:40.869" style="s2">grad school environment was that he had</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.970" end="00:43:44.609" style="s2">initially been kind of an anti</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.869" end="00:43:48.490" style="s2">adaptation esteem around later in life</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.609" end="00:43:53.530" style="s2">so that&#39;s to his credit he saw the power</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.490" end="00:43:56.260" style="s2">of this style of thinking and anyway so</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.530" end="00:43:59.080" style="s2">I would say loosely speaking I feel pop</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.260" end="00:44:00.010" style="s2">Aryan I&#39;m sure I don&#39;t subscribe to all</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.080" end="00:44:01.690" style="s2">of it</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.010" end="00:44:05.200" style="s2">yeah so field Darwinian and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.690" end="00:44:08.890" style="s2">subscribe to every detail but but anyway</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.200" end="00:44:11.650" style="s2">yeah did he have it right he advanced</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.890" end="00:44:13.890" style="s2">the ball substantially yeah and with</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.650" end="00:44:16.300" style="s2">regard to David Deutsch and his take</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.890" end="00:44:18.820" style="s2">have read some of the Abdullah&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.300" end="00:44:21.340" style="s2">but I don&#39;t remember his take on popper</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.820" end="00:44:24.880" style="s2">particularly yeah if you do me either at</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.340" end="00:44:29.710" style="s2">the moment I&#39;m a little leery based on</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.880" end="00:44:32.650" style="s2">his multi world stuff but Deutsch is</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.710" end="00:44:36.520" style="s2">yeah so anyway not much to say</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.650" end="00:44:38.350" style="s2">unfortunately yeah last you questions I</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.520" end="00:44:40.210" style="s2">wanted to read here are both ones I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.350" end="00:44:42.250" style="s2">not sure that we can do particularly</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.210" end="00:44:44.470" style="s2">well on have you any thoughts on Terra</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.250" end="00:44:47.320" style="s2">Preta the black birth of the Amazon</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.470" end="00:44:48.910" style="s2">thanks as always I don&#39;t know what that</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.320" end="00:44:51.580" style="s2">is and I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.910" end="00:44:55.030" style="s2">that the spelling is throwing me and I</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.580" end="00:44:58.630" style="s2">don&#39;t know I will look it up I have some</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.030" end="00:45:06.340" style="s2">danced yeah what is it it is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.630" end="00:45:10.080" style="s2">self renewing artificially enriched soil</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.340" end="00:45:12.850" style="s2">so it&#39;s kind of it&#39;s part of a Amazonian</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.080" end="00:45:17.080" style="s2">agricultural tradition that goes back a</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.850" end="00:45:19.960" style="s2">couple thousand years anyway here&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.080" end="00:45:22.660" style="s2">what we&#39;ve done by agriculturalists in</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.960" end="00:45:24.670" style="s2">the Amazon long before there were any</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.660" end="00:45:27.790" style="s2">people but the original / Indians in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.670" end="00:45:31.060" style="s2">new world you know who are doing this or</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.790" end="00:45:34.180" style="s2">with bioactive techniques like well so</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.060" end="00:45:35.950" style="s2">it you know it&#39;s reminiscent of what the</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.180" end="00:45:38.050" style="s2">Maya were doing in the sense that the</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.950" end="00:45:40.450" style="s2">Maya had very sophisticated soil</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.050" end="00:45:41.590" style="s2">chemistry at the empirical level what</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.450" end="00:45:42.640" style="s2">they understood about what they were</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.590" end="00:45:45.310" style="s2">doing and why it worked</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.640" end="00:45:47.700" style="s2">we have no idea sure but but in both</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.310" end="00:45:50.710" style="s2">cases both the Amazonians and the Maya</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.700" end="00:45:52.360" style="s2">Maya less so but we&#39;re working with very</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.710" end="00:45:54.670" style="s2">poor tropical soils as tropical soils</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.360" end="00:45:56.920" style="s2">tend to be except in volcanic zones yep</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.670" end="00:45:58.690" style="s2">so they needed to enrich their soil</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.920" end="00:46:01.510" style="s2">affair according to be agriculturalists</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.690" end="00:46:03.190" style="s2">the Maya in many cases were working with</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.510" end="00:46:03.710" style="s2">alluvial soils which are better than</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.190" end="00:46:05.690" style="s2">average</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.710" end="00:46:08.690" style="s2">but we&#39;re still talking about a tropical</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.690" end="00:46:10.670" style="s2">alluvial soil and the Amazonians were</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.690" end="00:46:13.490" style="s2">obviously working in an environment</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.670" end="00:46:16.280" style="s2">which there&#39;s a lot of nutrient but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.490" end="00:46:19.099" style="s2">not in the soil it&#39;s not very deep at</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.280" end="00:46:22.099" style="s2">all so anyway these soils were enriched</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.099" end="00:46:23.810" style="s2">in a way that as my understanding which</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.099" end="00:46:25.910" style="s2">is very superficial is that they are</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.810" end="00:46:28.849" style="s2">sort of self renewing and that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.910" end="00:46:33.140" style="s2">still sort of functionally findable</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.849" end="00:46:35.660" style="s2">still now yeah so anyway amazing right</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.140" end="00:46:39.440" style="s2">it&#39;s fantastic if the story is anything</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.660" end="00:46:42.680" style="s2">like we think it is it&#39;s a case of human</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.440" end="00:46:46.190" style="s2">beings having made a discovery of some</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.680" end="00:46:50.500" style="s2">form that allowed them to alter the</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.190" end="00:46:54.410" style="s2">capacity of the Amazon to deliver crops</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.500" end="00:46:57.589" style="s2">and that in effect what they&#39;ve done is</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.410" end="00:46:59.930" style="s2">something you know where we would have</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.589" end="00:47:01.490" style="s2">trouble reproducing the level of success</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.930" end="00:47:03.440" style="s2">on that soil yes we can</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.490" end="00:47:05.800" style="s2">drench it in some kind of externally</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.440" end="00:47:08.930" style="s2">derived fertilizer but a self renewing</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.800" end="00:47:12.260" style="s2">soil would be you know beyond us what</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.930" end="00:47:14.359" style="s2">you could do and yet people who didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.260" end="00:47:16.130" style="s2">have sophisticated laboratories or a</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.359" end="00:47:18.140" style="s2">periodic table or anything we&#39;re able to</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.130" end="00:47:20.660" style="s2">deduce how to get there and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.140" end="00:47:23.000" style="s2">nature of human beings it&#39;s the the</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.660" end="00:47:25.339" style="s2">flip-flop between culture and</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.000" end="00:47:29.270" style="s2">consciousness and this is the kind of</p>

<p begin="00:48:33.470" end="00:48:48.650" style="s2">I think the the trade-off having to do</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.670" end="00:48:51.109" style="s2">with your unique brilliance makes it</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.650" end="00:48:57.410" style="s2">difficult for you to meet some of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.109" end="00:49:00.470" style="s2">expectations of a modern society go on I</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.410" end="00:49:05.089" style="s2">know that to be true as as do you yep</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.470" end="00:49:07.609" style="s2">and it is not for lack of self awareness</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.089" end="00:49:09.080" style="s2">on your part certainly when we first met</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.609" end="00:49:15.859" style="s2">when we were in high school you weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.080" end="00:49:18.680" style="s2">aware but watching your self awareness</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.859" end="00:49:20.720" style="s2">of your own difficulties meeting</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.680" end="00:49:24.160" style="s2">expectations that need to be met that</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.720" end="00:49:27.200" style="s2">are not simply owners or stupid rise</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.160" end="00:49:31.270" style="s2">with with with a rise also in your</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.200" end="00:49:33.740" style="s2">ability to overcome that but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.270" end="00:49:35.630" style="s2">commitment with like the rise in your</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.740" end="00:49:37.400" style="s2">ability to overcome it hasn&#39;t risen as</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.630" end="00:49:39.320" style="s2">hasn&#39;t gone as fast as your rising</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.400" end="00:49:42.109" style="s2">self-awareness so in some ways you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.320" end="00:49:45.980" style="s2">more evermore frustrated with yourself I</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.109" end="00:49:47.480" style="s2">think yeah right yeah and it sucks I</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.980" end="00:49:52.910" style="s2">know what I should be doing just can&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:49:52.910" end="00:49:56.960" style="s2">know I&#39;m gonna swap the answer I was</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.560" end="00:49:59.599" style="s2">gonna deliver for a better one I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.960" end="00:50:00.500" style="s2">more insightful we share with me the</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.599" end="00:50:03.609" style="s2">other one later</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.500" end="00:50:08.230" style="s2">sure nothing that would surprise you but</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.609" end="00:50:13.609" style="s2">the thing about Heather is that she was</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.230" end="00:50:15.589" style="s2">tremendously introverted and she still</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.609" end="00:50:20.960" style="s2">has these instincts but she has</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.589" end="00:50:23.390" style="s2">discovered over time that the value that</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.960" end="00:50:26.920" style="s2">she can deliver in the world that her</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.390" end="00:50:28.320" style="s2">ability to generate things that she</p>

<p begin="00:50:28.320" end="00:50:35.880" style="s2">hi NF esteemed to be worth her time has</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.230" end="00:50:39.300" style="s2">required her to find skills to function</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.880" end="00:50:45.660" style="s2">as an extrovert even though it is not in</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.300" end="00:50:47.880" style="s2">her nature at all and in particular you</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.660" end="00:50:49.500" style="s2">know I when you first started teaching I</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.880" end="00:50:51.020" style="s2">think you were just mortified by</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.500" end="00:50:55.050" style="s2">standing in front of the class</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.020" end="00:50:56.910" style="s2">yeah you really did and so I watched in</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.050" end="00:50:58.470" style="s2">a very short number of years it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.910" end="00:51:00.180" style="s2">like this was the way things were at the</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.470" end="00:51:02.220" style="s2">end of your teaching ever and this was</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.180" end="00:51:04.380" style="s2">the way things were all along you having</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.220" end="00:51:07.760" style="s2">learned this trick as a teaching</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.380" end="00:51:15.920" style="s2">assistant in graduate school but you</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.760" end="00:51:18.750" style="s2">managed to induce a kind of desire to</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.920" end="00:51:21.120" style="s2">impress you and get your approval in</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.750" end="00:51:23.520" style="s2">students that most people if they had</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.120" end="00:51:25.200" style="s2">that kind of influence over people would</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.520" end="00:51:27.270" style="s2">abuse it or they wouldn&#39;t take it</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.200" end="00:51:29.940" style="s2">seriously but you used it so carefully</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.270" end="00:51:31.980" style="s2">and so honorably in order to get</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.940" end="00:51:33.510" style="s2">students to perform at a level that most</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.980" end="00:51:38.520" style="s2">of them did not know that they could</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.510" end="00:51:41.340" style="s2">perform that it was it was it was</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.520" end="00:51:42.720" style="s2">astonishing because you know first of</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.340" end="00:51:43.650" style="s2">all people were very frequently your</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.720" end="00:51:47.280" style="s2">students were very frequently</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.650" end="00:51:49.320" style="s2">intimidated by you and so they would</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.280" end="00:51:51.330" style="s2">talk to me about this I some reason they</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.320" end="00:51:53.910" style="s2">were less intimidated by me and they</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.330" end="00:51:55.500" style="s2">would talk to me no it&#39;s absolutely true</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.910" end="00:51:57.930" style="s2">they would talk to me about you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.500" end="00:51:59.760" style="s2">their concerns and if you know if</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.930" end="00:52:01.650" style="s2">somebody did something great and you you</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.760" end="00:52:03.890" style="s2">know would your feedback was of course</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.650" end="00:52:07.320" style="s2">always extensive and you would deliver</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.890" end="00:52:09.330" style="s2">this this piece of feedback to them and</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.320" end="00:52:11.160" style="s2">they would be just so overjoyed to have</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.330" end="00:52:12.900" style="s2">discovered something that was of enough</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.160" end="00:52:16.800" style="s2">value to catch your attention in all of</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.900" end="00:52:20.730" style="s2">this so anyway my point is you mastered</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.800" end="00:52:23.250" style="s2">something that was outside of what even</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.730" end="00:52:25.560" style="s2">felt comfortable for you at first and</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.250" end="00:52:27.480" style="s2">you know I think you still have this</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.560" end="00:52:30.900" style="s2">tension within you but the way you</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.480" end="00:52:34.410" style="s2">overcame your own shyness in order to be</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.900" end="00:52:37.020" style="s2">able to slam dunk the role of professor</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.410" end="00:52:39.870" style="s2">and be the professor everybody everybody</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.020" end="00:52:40.630" style="s2">needs and most people who see it know</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.870" end="00:52:45.340" style="s2">enough to walk</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.630" end="00:52:46.660" style="s2">that right that was stunning and I have</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.340" end="00:52:49.180" style="s2">to tell you among the things that makes</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.660" end="00:52:51.130" style="s2">me absolutely the most livid about what</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.180" end="00:52:54.220" style="s2">happened in Evergreen was that they</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.130" end="00:52:59.890" style="s2">dared to do this to you after you had</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.220" end="00:53:03.100" style="s2">risen to the the top of this this role</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.890" end="00:53:04.900" style="s2">where you know students adored you and</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.100" end="00:53:06.640" style="s2">they were so right to do it because what</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.900" end="00:53:07.900" style="s2">you were doing was so good for them and</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.640" end="00:53:11.340" style="s2">that these people treated that was such</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.900" end="00:53:13.240" style="s2">a disrespect was just despicable</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.340" end="00:53:16.450" style="s2">absolutely despicable</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.240" end="00:53:19.780" style="s2">that&#39;s an amazing answer thank you</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.450" end="00:53:21.370" style="s2">it&#39;s all true and you know what there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.780" end="00:53:31.480" style="s2">not a student that was in your class he</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.370" end="00:53:34.810" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t back me up how about this for</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.480" end="00:53:36.670" style="s2">the next unknown virus offer $100,000 to</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.810" end="00:53:38.920" style="s2">people to get infected and live on site</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.670" end="00:53:41.320" style="s2">of the infection clears sample-sized a</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.920" end="00:53:47.380" style="s2">thousand in two weeks we would have an</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.320" end="00:53:50.050" style="s2">estimate of the death rate I love ideas</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.380" end="00:53:52.690" style="s2">like this I don&#39;t think we need it and I</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.050" end="00:53:54.550" style="s2">don&#39;t really want us to engage in this</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.690" end="00:53:56.650" style="s2">kind of thing because we don&#39;t need it</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.550" end="00:53:59.500" style="s2">but I do I think we need to start</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.650" end="00:54:01.600" style="s2">thinking like this but it it would give</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.500" end="00:54:03.520" style="s2">us it would give us more than just a</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.600" end="00:54:06.180" style="s2">death rate right it would give us other</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.520" end="00:54:08.980" style="s2">clues to how it progressed and people</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.180" end="00:54:12.250" style="s2">who didn&#39;t die and how people recover it</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.980" end="00:54:14.410" style="s2">and such but it would mostly give us a</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.250" end="00:54:17.410" style="s2">death rate at a particular moment in</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.410" end="00:54:18.820" style="s2">time and as we&#39;ve talked about as you</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.410" end="00:54:20.050" style="s2">specifically talked about in the last</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.820" end="00:54:22.360" style="s2">last two minutes we&#39;ve been talking</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.050" end="00:54:24.910" style="s2">about for many of them the fact is that</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.360" end="00:54:26.950" style="s2">the reason one of the big reasons this</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.910" end="00:54:29.500" style="s2">is so hard to pin down is that it is</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.950" end="00:54:33.820" style="s2">rapidly evolving and so that would give</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.500" end="00:54:35.710" style="s2">us a snapshot of its early its early</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.820" end="00:54:37.360" style="s2">evolution especially if it&#39;s an emerging</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.710" end="00:54:39.850" style="s2">virus that hasn&#39;t known humans before</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.360" end="00:54:42.340" style="s2">now that that that first moment that</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.850" end="00:54:43.660" style="s2">it&#39;s in humans is not necessarily going</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.340" end="00:54:44.920" style="s2">to look like the moment three months</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.660" end="00:54:49.840" style="s2">later or six months later or a year</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.920" end="00:54:52.210" style="s2">there yeah so in principle something</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.840" end="00:54:54.280" style="s2">like this I prefer in the case of</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.210" end="00:54:55.810" style="s2">infectious disease that we find</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.280" end="00:54:58.750" style="s2">good natural experiments so that we</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.810" end="00:55:02.230" style="s2">don&#39;t end up confronting the ethical</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.750" end="00:55:05.200" style="s2">dilemma of effectively paying people to</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.230" end="00:55:08.200" style="s2">suffer harm on our behalf and things</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.200" end="00:55:10.420" style="s2">like that which you know that people</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.200" end="00:55:12.250" style="s2">sign up for clinical trials and stuff so</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.420" end="00:55:14.230" style="s2">it&#39;s not like that&#39;s unheard of but</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.250" end="00:55:16.090" style="s2">anyway there&#39;s a slippery slope here and</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.230" end="00:55:19.000" style="s2">I would like not to step so far on to it</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.090" end="00:55:22.960" style="s2">that we end up you know a crumpled heap</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.000" end="00:55:26.590" style="s2">at the bottom yeah I have followed you</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.960" end="00:55:32.820" style="s2">since Evergreen debacle thank you what</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.590" end="00:55:34.890" style="s2">do you do when you are weary hmm well a</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.820" end="00:55:38.230" style="s2">number of things</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.890" end="00:55:40.630" style="s2">yesterday I had a particularly agonizing</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.230" end="00:55:45.460" style="s2">and horrifying day trying to learn new</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.630" end="00:55:47.650" style="s2">tax software and get our various threads</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.460" end="00:55:52.240" style="s2">financial threads into a single coherent</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.650" end="00:55:53.800" style="s2">mass and it was not successful and I</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.240" end="00:55:55.690" style="s2">mean I was literally in tears at times</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.800" end="00:55:56.980" style="s2">which doesn&#39;t happen very often</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.690" end="00:55:58.300" style="s2">there&#39;s a point in the middle of the day</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.980" end="00:56:02.380" style="s2">where you were flirting with the concept</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.300" end="00:56:03.880" style="s2">of Anarchy that&#39;s rarer than tears for</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.380" end="00:56:08.050" style="s2">me yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.880" end="00:56:11.890" style="s2">and at some point hmm I don&#39;t know six</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.050" end="00:56:14.290" style="s2">six thirty you came into I was working</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.890" end="00:56:15.700" style="s2">you know papers of computer all around</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.290" end="00:56:17.740" style="s2">me and just you know my head in my hands</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.700" end="00:56:21.880" style="s2">like oh my god and you said we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.740" end="00:56:25.300" style="s2">outside and it was a gross day here it</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.880" end="00:56:28.000" style="s2">was cool and I mean from May it was dark</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.300" end="00:56:29.830" style="s2">and gray and a little windy and a little</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.000" end="00:56:31.930" style="s2">bit rainy but we live in a beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.830" end="00:56:33.580" style="s2">place we live in the forest and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.930" end="00:56:37.930" style="s2">made it more beautiful during lockdown</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.580" end="00:56:39.850" style="s2">by a lot but getting rid of a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.930" end="00:56:43.660" style="s2">invasive plants and planting a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.850" end="00:56:45.580" style="s2">things and you know I said to you</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.660" end="00:56:47.740" style="s2">standing out there just you know even</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.580" end="00:56:51.610" style="s2">just for five minutes I said if I had to</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.740" end="00:56:53.410" style="s2">choose if I had to choose between ever</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.610" end="00:56:55.120" style="s2">being able to be outside again and never</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.410" end="00:56:57.070" style="s2">being able to be on a computer again the</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.120" end="00:56:58.540" style="s2">choice is so obvious even though it</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.070" end="00:57:00.100" style="s2">would interfere with my ability to do</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.540" end="00:57:01.540" style="s2">what I want to do in the world and be</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.100" end="00:57:04.420" style="s2">creative and productive in the way that</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.540" end="00:57:06.380" style="s2">I need to so being outside in nature is</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.420" end="00:57:09.380" style="s2">is a big</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.380" end="00:57:11.060" style="s2">sir - what what we both do and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.380" end="00:57:13.820" style="s2">worried there are many other answers</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.060" end="00:57:18.770" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m not sure how much I relate to</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.820" end="00:57:22.070" style="s2">the concept of being wearing it you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.770" end="00:57:24.140" style="s2">I did there&#39;s certain things that just I</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.070" end="00:57:26.510" style="s2">know they exist it&#39;s not like I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.140" end="00:57:28.520" style="s2">felt them but um but they just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.510" end="00:57:29.480" style="s2">crop up that much and you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.520" end="00:57:31.400" style="s2">lot of times when I&#39;m just not</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.480" end="00:57:33.140" style="s2">productive the way I should be I know</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.400" end="00:57:37.790" style="s2">what I should be producing and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.140" end="00:57:41.020" style="s2">producing it but but that said I do feel</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.790" end="00:57:43.280" style="s2">like we&#39;ve chosen to live in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.020" end="00:57:47.150" style="s2">that there&#39;s a lot that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.280" end="00:57:49.790" style="s2">thought-provoking and sometimes being</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.150" end="00:57:51.230" style="s2">lost in thought and then finding</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.790" end="00:57:53.030" style="s2">something interesting and sparking a</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.230" end="00:57:55.850" style="s2">discussion and seeing where it goes</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.030" end="00:57:58.250" style="s2">that that process is productive over the</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.850" end="00:57:59.990" style="s2">long haul even if you couldn&#39;t measure</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.250" end="00:58:01.910" style="s2">the productivity in a given day or a</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.990" end="00:58:06.490" style="s2">given week so anyway I&#39;ve learned to</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.910" end="00:58:09.890" style="s2">trust that and it&#39;s amazing how often</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.490" end="00:58:12.530" style="s2">the the answer you&#39;ve been looking for</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.890" end="00:58:15.200" style="s2">comes out of the blue after months</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.530" end="00:58:16.760" style="s2">sometimes years of searching in what</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.200" end="00:58:18.290" style="s2">feels like an unproductive way and I</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.760" end="00:58:20.570" style="s2">know those two things are not</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.290" end="00:58:22.550" style="s2">disconnected so the searching doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.570" end="00:58:26.510" style="s2">feel productive but it is productive</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.550" end="00:58:28.010" style="s2">therefore you should hack the system so</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.510" end="00:58:30.530" style="s2">that you can feel productive with it</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.010" end="00:58:33.200" style="s2">without requiring yourself to deliver</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.530" end="00:58:36.020" style="s2">evidence because eventually the thing</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.200" end="00:58:42.980" style="s2">you know just emerges in a psycho</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.020" end="00:58:45.170" style="s2">well that was worth it good does being</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.980" end="00:58:49.670" style="s2">left-handed say anything about humans</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.170" end="00:58:52.070" style="s2">either psychologically maybe</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.670" end="00:58:54.200" style="s2">physiologically psychologically isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.070" end="00:58:57.230" style="s2">thing we are so I&#39;m going to go with I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.200" end="00:58:58.850" style="s2">gonna start over again and insert my</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.230" end="00:59:00.380" style="s2">interpretation of what this word is does</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.850" end="00:59:01.850" style="s2">being left-handed say anything about</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.380" end="00:59:04.220" style="s2">humans either physiologically or</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.850" end="00:59:07.340" style="s2">psychologically I love you guys thanks</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.220" end="00:59:11.710" style="s2">so another topic about which I could</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.340" end="00:59:14.270" style="s2">talk endlessly we as vertebrates have</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.710" end="00:59:16.340" style="s2">lateralization which means we have were</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.270" end="00:59:18.150" style="s2">bilaterally symmetrical and we aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.340" end="00:59:21.480" style="s2">perfectly symmetrical at the</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.150" end="00:59:26.240" style="s2">brain level and therefore at at the</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.480" end="00:59:30.029" style="s2">appendicular skeleton level so all of us</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.240" end="00:59:31.980" style="s2">and all of us humans have not just a</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.029" end="00:59:35.190" style="s2">dominant hand but also dominant foot to</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.980" end="00:59:36.539" style="s2">dominate ear dominant eye and once you</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.190" end="00:59:38.760" style="s2">establish what your dominant hand is</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.539" end="00:59:41.460" style="s2">it&#39;s likely that you are the same</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.760" end="00:59:44.400" style="s2">dominant foot and ear and eye but not</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.460" end="00:59:46.470" style="s2">totally clear and so what what would be</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.400" end="00:59:47.490" style="s2">the value and having one be dominant</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.470" end="00:59:51.319" style="s2">over the other well it&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.490" end="00:59:53.220" style="s2">specialization right but then why</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.319" end="00:59:55.220" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t everyone in the population</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.220" end="00:59:56.819" style="s2">just have exactly the same</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.220" end="00:59:58.589" style="s2">specialization it would certainly make</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.819" end="01:00:01.079" style="s2">it easier for the left handers myself</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.589" end="01:00:02.819" style="s2">included if I didn&#39;t always have to find</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.079" end="01:00:05.670" style="s2">a different spatula different pair of</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.819" end="01:00:07.799" style="s2">scissors and you know you know find when</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.670" end="01:00:09.390" style="s2">we&#39;re sharing cheese together I have to</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.799" end="01:00:11.220" style="s2">switch it around to be able to access</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.390" end="01:00:14.369" style="s2">the you know the correct end of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.220" end="01:00:16.950" style="s2">cheese etc but at a population level</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.369" end="01:00:18.210" style="s2">having roughly 10% across all</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.950" end="01:00:19.799" style="s2">populations where it&#39;s ever been looked</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.210" end="01:00:21.630" style="s2">at which is to say pretty much all human</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.799" end="01:00:23.369" style="s2">populations have been looked at roughly</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.630" end="01:00:27.059" style="s2">10% of the population being left-handed</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.369" end="01:00:29.670" style="s2">as opposed to right-handed allows for a</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.059" end="01:00:31.410" style="s2">different kind of approach to situations</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.670" end="01:00:32.819" style="s2">and not just a physical approach like oh</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.410" end="01:00:34.890" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to climb a tree and all the</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.819" end="01:00:36.000" style="s2">lawyers before me couldn&#39;t get there but</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.890" end="01:00:39.450" style="s2">the left-hander has a different</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.000" end="01:00:42.089" style="s2">different vantage on it but also just a</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.450" end="01:00:43.440" style="s2">different a different mental approach to</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.089" end="01:00:45.390" style="s2">different like momentum from mental</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.440" end="01:00:48.420" style="s2">rotation to just mental gymnastics but a</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.390" end="01:00:51.059" style="s2">4 o&#39;clock gymnastics is is differently</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.420" end="01:00:53.839" style="s2">allowed by a left-handed brain it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.059" end="01:00:55.890" style="s2">true that left-handers are less</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.839" end="01:00:58.940" style="s2">specialized with regard to</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.890" end="01:01:01.559" style="s2">lateralization that we tend to have</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.940" end="01:01:03.029" style="s2">larger more connected corpus collosum z&#39;</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.559" end="01:01:05.670" style="s2">which means that our left and right</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.029" end="01:01:09.359" style="s2">hemispheres are more connected of course</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.670" end="01:01:12.119" style="s2">the trade-off being that it&#39;s harder to</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.359" end="01:01:16.380" style="s2">get things past one hemisphere with the</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.119" end="01:01:18.779" style="s2">other and perhaps harder to find total</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.380" end="01:01:20.010" style="s2">utter focus and go super deep that you</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.779" end="01:01:21.690" style="s2">know it&#39;s maybe more of a generalist</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.010" end="01:01:25.230" style="s2">paradigm so there&#39;s a lot more to be</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.690" end="01:01:27.599" style="s2">said there but tantalizing fact you tell</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.230" end="01:01:29.880" style="s2">me if I have it wrong enlarged corpus</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.599" end="01:01:31.350" style="s2">callosum accompanies the condition of</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.880" end="01:01:33.780" style="s2">being female</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.350" end="01:01:37.440" style="s2">being gay and male and being left-handed</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.780" end="01:01:39.000" style="s2">am i correct yes with the caveat that so</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.440" end="01:01:40.680" style="s2">this is something I used to always say</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.000" end="01:01:42.690" style="s2">in my classes and occasionally I&#39;d get</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.680" end="01:01:45.390" style="s2">so it&#39;s not just gay and male just</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.690" end="01:01:47.850" style="s2">homosexual so females homosexuals and</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.390" end="01:01:49.890" style="s2">left-handers all are understood as I</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.850" end="01:01:52.920" style="s2">used to say to my classes a lot to have</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.890" end="01:01:55.770" style="s2">larger corpus callosum than than men</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.920" end="01:01:57.090" style="s2">straight people or right-handers and you</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.770" end="01:01:59.540" style="s2">know in almost every class I&#39;d get</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.090" end="01:02:02.220" style="s2">someone going you know I got all three</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.540" end="01:02:05.310" style="s2">but it&#39;s a it&#39;s not better it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.220" end="01:02:07.290" style="s2">different you know it&#39;s it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.310" end="01:02:09.930" style="s2">different way of being that is better in</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.290" end="01:02:12.360" style="s2">some situations but not others and when</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.930" end="01:02:16.050" style="s2">I looked into it recently I think that I</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.360" end="01:02:18.150" style="s2">remember that the data are around women</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.050" end="01:02:20.100" style="s2">was actually a little bit more nuanced</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.150" end="01:02:22.500" style="s2">than it seemed because of course like</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.100" end="01:02:24.360" style="s2">all of these things in a complex body</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.500" end="01:02:27.270" style="s2">like a human body corpus callosum</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.360" end="01:02:31.410" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have strict boundaries and so</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.270" end="01:02:32.910" style="s2">exactly what you&#39;re measuring is is not</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.410" end="01:02:35.010" style="s2">totally clear and if you measure it one</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.910" end="01:02:37.830" style="s2">way it seems like females have slightly</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.010" end="01:02:39.870" style="s2">larger corpus callosum than men but if</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.830" end="01:02:41.910" style="s2">you measure it maybe a slightly more</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.870" end="01:02:45.090" style="s2">standard way that difference disappeared</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.910" end="01:02:48.180" style="s2">so I&#39;m not sure that it totally holds up</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.090" end="01:02:50.340" style="s2">and it seems to maybe so the data Iran</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.180" end="01:02:51.690" style="s2">women is harder to understand and smells</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.340" end="01:02:52.890" style="s2">better is that what you&#39;re saying it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.690" end="01:02:58.050" style="s2">exactly what I said okay</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.890" end="01:03:00.350" style="s2">perfect yeah is virus RNA more</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.050" end="01:03:03.540" style="s2">information intensive than human DNA</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.350" end="01:03:05.010" style="s2">referring to non-coding DNA if that is</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.540" end="01:03:09.020" style="s2">the case does it affect how viruses</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.010" end="01:03:09.020" style="s2">evolve compared to same mammals</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.230" end="01:03:14.190" style="s2">information intensive sure hard</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.210" end="01:03:19.650" style="s2">information intensive means I think what</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.190" end="01:03:23.490" style="s2">it means is less room for noisy stuff</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.650" end="01:03:25.380" style="s2">and that&#39;s probably true the fact of</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.490" end="01:03:26.850" style="s2">just because it&#39;s more constrained by</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.380" end="01:03:29.820" style="s2">size yeah is that why you say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.850" end="01:03:33.200" style="s2">probably true yeah at the cost of wasted</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.820" end="01:03:37.860" style="s2">spaces is higher relative to the total</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.200" end="01:03:40.770" style="s2">that said junk DNA is a concept that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.860" end="01:03:42.360" style="s2">proud to say never made a widow sense to</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.770" end="01:03:43.440" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.360" end="01:03:46.050" style="s2">they don&#39;t this person doesn&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.440" end="01:03:48.170" style="s2">chocolates right noncoding right yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.050" end="01:03:50.790" style="s2">there is non-coding stuff that it still</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.170" end="01:03:54.540" style="s2">contains information telomere would be a</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.790" end="01:03:56.640" style="s2">great example so it&#39;s a little hard to</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.540" end="01:03:59.880" style="s2">evaluate your question because there may</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.640" end="01:04:03.120" style="s2">be more of that stuff in let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.880" end="01:04:05.370" style="s2">vertebrate DNA then there is in viral</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.120" end="01:04:10.730" style="s2">DNA because maybe more of the viral DNA</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.370" end="01:04:13.470" style="s2">is protein coding or there abouts so</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.730" end="01:04:15.600" style="s2">anyway it&#39;s hard to compare the two I</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.470" end="01:04:18.600" style="s2">would say probably there&#39;s more room in</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.600" end="01:04:20.100" style="s2">vertebrates for noisy stuff and</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.600" end="01:04:21.720" style="s2">inefficiency and so you might expect</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.100" end="01:04:24.510" style="s2">more of it and yes this would have an</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.720" end="01:04:30.120" style="s2">effect on evolution because what it</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.510" end="01:04:36.840" style="s2">means is nonsynonymous mutations would</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.120" end="01:04:39.000" style="s2">be more likely to be disruptive so</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.840" end="01:04:44.460" style="s2">anyway you might expect something like</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.000" end="01:04:46.440" style="s2">that to alter the rate of evolution</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.460" end="01:04:48.660" style="s2">under certain circumstances or maybe all</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.440" end="01:04:50.340" style="s2">of them so yes broad-brush I think</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.660" end="01:04:52.590" style="s2">you&#39;re on the right track how to say it</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.340" end="01:04:54.150" style="s2">specifically I don&#39;t know and I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.590" end="01:04:57.330" style="s2">there are people who are expert in this</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.150" end="01:05:01.380" style="s2">exact question and we&#39;re not done so we</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.330" end="01:05:07.710" style="s2">are at an hour and 10 we are I think all</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.380" end="01:05:12.240" style="s2">right well we have arrived at the end of</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.710" end="01:05:15.780" style="s2">the Q&amp;A wow that flew by yeah all right</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.240" end="01:05:20.840" style="s2">so this has been excellent we will</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.780" end="01:05:26.400" style="s2">return on Saturday May 23rd with a</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.840" end="01:05:29.970" style="s2">Evergreen themed retrospective special</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.400" end="01:05:32.460" style="s2">live stream Dark Horse podcast and that</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.970" end="01:05:37.020" style="s2">sort of thing so look forward to it xxx</p>
