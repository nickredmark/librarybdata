<p begin="00:00:48.719" end="00:00:54.600" style="s2">opinions with regard to in this together</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.719" end="00:00:56.190" style="s2">america.org organization excuse me we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.600" end="00:00:58.289" style="s2">just we&#39;ve looked at it just a little</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.190" end="00:01:00.629" style="s2">bit not too much</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.289" end="00:01:02.309" style="s2">do you want to show that you could show</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.629" end="00:01:05.729" style="s2">that yes I won&#39;t be able to read any</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.309" end="00:01:07.229" style="s2">more questions until it&#39;s unshown but so</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.729" end="00:01:10.350" style="s2">this is this is the organization we were</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.229" end="00:01:13.710" style="s2">being asked about and you know I just</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.350" end="00:01:16.439" style="s2">looked at this a tiny tiny tiny bit and</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.710" end="00:01:19.049" style="s2">you know I was I was I noted this</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.439" end="00:01:21.030" style="s2">declaration of interdependence which is</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.049" end="00:01:25.439" style="s2">part of why I went looking for what you</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.030" end="00:01:28.710" style="s2">had written back in 2011 it is you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.439" end="00:01:30.210" style="s2">it&#39;s not the same but it looks it looks</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.710" end="00:01:34.380" style="s2">good and frankly we&#39;re seeing a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.210" end="00:01:36.439" style="s2">these sorts of sorts of coming together</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.380" end="00:01:39.030" style="s2">comings together yeah I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.439" end="00:01:42.899" style="s2">across a number of domains at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.030" end="00:01:44.729" style="s2">and I you know I don&#39;t know a ton about</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.899" end="00:01:46.790" style="s2">this particular one it does seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.729" end="00:01:50.970" style="s2">it appears to be what it appears to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.790" end="00:01:52.890" style="s2">and I&#39;m not sure there needs to be a</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.970" end="00:01:54.270" style="s2">single movement like this I think the</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.890" end="00:01:55.799" style="s2">fact that they are popping up and</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.270" end="00:01:58.670" style="s2">flourishing all over the place is a good</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.799" end="00:02:00.869" style="s2">sign that a lot of people are noticing</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.670" end="00:02:04.439" style="s2">that the current moment has proven</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.869" end="00:02:05.939" style="s2">divisive rather than inclusive and it</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.439" end="00:02:10.860" style="s2">denies things like our interdependence</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.939" end="00:02:13.860" style="s2">and it moves away from unity so I do not</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.860" end="00:02:16.120" style="s2">think that this particular website is</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.860" end="00:02:18.580" style="s2">proposing a political solution right</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.120" end="00:02:20.530" style="s2">which means that they actually have no</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.580" end="00:02:21.400" style="s2">reason not to join forces if they find</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.530" end="00:02:23.739" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.400" end="00:02:25.000" style="s2">mission aligned which probably we are so</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.739" end="00:02:27.010" style="s2">anyway I don&#39;t want to vouch for them I</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.000" end="00:02:31.959" style="s2">don&#39;t know who they are and upon reading</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.010" end="00:02:35.739" style="s2">I hope to be impressed and delighted and</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.959" end="00:02:38.530" style="s2">if so once you reach out to us in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.739" end="00:02:40.930" style="s2">unity 2020 cause because maybe this</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.530" end="00:02:45.250" style="s2">would be the quick way to get where all</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.930" end="00:02:50.560" style="s2">of us are trying to get us good okay the</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.250" end="00:02:53.590" style="s2">the last two questions from livestream</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.560" end="00:02:55.209" style="s2">28 the first is a comment Brett the</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.590" end="00:02:58.569" style="s2">parking meter has been expired for too</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.209" end="00:02:59.680" style="s2">long you need to move your car to me</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.569" end="00:03:02.610" style="s2">like you need to move your workbench</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.680" end="00:03:08.019" style="s2">that parking meter actually is more</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.610" end="00:03:10.330" style="s2">interesting than you realize and for</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.019" end="00:03:12.130" style="s2">lack of coins I don&#39;t know it certainly</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.330" end="00:03:15.610" style="s2">I could have dug up some have coins we</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.130" end="00:03:16.090" style="s2">have coins but anyway yes one could fire</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.610" end="00:03:18.609" style="s2">it up</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.090" end="00:03:20.170" style="s2">with coins and then I have the light go</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.609" end="00:03:21.850" style="s2">off of its own accord and at the point</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.170" end="00:03:24.730" style="s2">the meter expire but also be making that</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.850" end="00:03:26.350" style="s2">classic old parking meter sound as it</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.730" end="00:03:28.000" style="s2">ticked down right yet which would be in</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.350" end="00:03:30.069" style="s2">the live stream probably not optimal</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.000" end="00:03:33.989" style="s2">probably not optimal probably not but</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.069" end="00:03:33.989" style="s2">your point about my car is well taken</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.109" end="00:03:39.970" style="s2">recently I&#39;m mostly including this for</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.720" end="00:03:41.230" style="s2">the final two hash tag recently saw a</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.970" end="00:03:42.760" style="s2">Facebook meme that people who wear</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.230" end="00:03:44.440" style="s2">glasses are smarter because they trade</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.760" end="00:03:47.109" style="s2">graphics for processing power thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.440" end="00:03:51.910" style="s2">also hash tag just lane Maxwell didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.109" end="00:03:54.549" style="s2">kill herself will not have killed</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.910" end="00:03:57.340" style="s2">herself that&#39;s right that&#39;s right but</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.549" end="00:04:00.130" style="s2">you know I definitely will not have I</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.340" end="00:04:03.040" style="s2">would so I saw Eric tweet about this and</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.130" end="00:04:07.630" style="s2">I was very much glasses no oh just like</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.040" end="00:04:09.280" style="s2">Maxwell yes prepare yourself that what</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.630" end="00:04:09.579" style="s2">you expect to happen it&#39;s not going to</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.280" end="00:04:11.470" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.579" end="00:04:13.450" style="s2">yeah something else will happen yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.470" end="00:04:17.410" style="s2">would be too obvious if it was it was</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.450" end="00:04:19.810" style="s2">that again yep so anyway the question</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.410" end="00:04:22.630" style="s2">about glasses yeah there well first of</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.810" end="00:04:25.300" style="s2">all there is a a set of trade-offs</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.630" end="00:04:27.340" style="s2">involved in frankly reading and what it</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.300" end="00:04:28.030" style="s2">does to your eyes as you will soon</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.340" end="00:04:30.430" style="s2">discover</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.030" end="00:04:32.560" style="s2">your teeth your teeth are suffering from</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.430" end="00:04:34.720" style="s2">modernity your eyes are also suffering</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.560" end="00:04:36.280" style="s2">from modernity and in fact all of you is</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.720" end="00:04:38.110" style="s2">suffering from modernity even as they</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.280" end="00:04:41.970" style="s2">are all profiting from modernity as well</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.110" end="00:04:41.970" style="s2">you know who&#39;s benefiting from modernity</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.230" end="00:04:50.400" style="s2">yeah the early modern animal it&#39;s a but</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.760" end="00:04:53.380" style="s2">anyway yeah there is a certain trade-off</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.400" end="00:04:55.419" style="s2">how did you specify it it was trade</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.380" end="00:04:57.400" style="s2">graphics for processing power I thought</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.419" end="00:04:59.320" style="s2">that&#39;s not gonna that&#39;s that&#39;s not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.400" end="00:05:01.990" style="s2">be yet I think I think that often people</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.320" end="00:05:04.630" style="s2">who wear glasses do wear glasses because</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.990" end="00:05:06.160" style="s2">they did read a lot as children and</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.630" end="00:05:08.530" style="s2">therefore they may have more information</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.160" end="00:05:10.510" style="s2">in their heads that&#39;s from books that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.530" end="00:05:12.220" style="s2">about as far as you can sort of I like</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.510" end="00:05:14.320" style="s2">it I think that fits the trade-off that</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.220" end="00:05:17.410" style="s2">you you optimized for taking in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.320" end="00:05:18.940" style="s2">information in a very direct fashion at</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.410" end="00:05:20.410" style="s2">some cost to your ability to see what</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.940" end="00:05:22.510" style="s2">the hell is going on in the world at a</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.410" end="00:05:25.540" style="s2">direct level it seems to me it is the</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.510" end="00:05:28.180" style="s2">trade-off being specified I don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.540" end="00:05:31.630" style="s2">that I&#39;m not being snide I&#39;m just kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.180" end="00:05:35.440" style="s2">of what it is I don&#39;t know I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.630" end="00:05:38.380" style="s2">how you oh you get there well because I</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.440" end="00:05:42.550" style="s2">mean is is allowing allowing people who</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.380" end="00:05:44.490" style="s2">have there are many other reasons to to</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.550" end="00:05:47.800" style="s2">end up with glasses but allowing people</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.490" end="00:05:50.380" style="s2">who have had their focus be to close at</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.800" end="00:05:54.220" style="s2">a critical developmental period to also</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.380" end="00:05:55.840" style="s2">see far away means that it would it</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.220" end="00:05:58.510" style="s2">would be a it would appear to be trying</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.840" end="00:06:03.760" style="s2">to do an end run around the this or that</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.510" end="00:06:07.030" style="s2">trade-off it is reducing the cost side</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.760" end="00:06:09.370" style="s2">of the trade-off by restoring vision</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.030" end="00:06:11.289" style="s2">with an obvious clewd now the</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.370" end="00:06:12.460" style="s2">interesting thing as you walk down the</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.289" end="00:06:14.020" style="s2">street and you see people with glasses</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.460" end="00:06:16.390" style="s2">and you don&#39;t think twice about the fact</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.020" end="00:06:19.900" style="s2">that they&#39;re wearing glasses the oddity</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.390" end="00:06:23.110" style="s2">of people wearing these pieces of</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.900" end="00:06:25.539" style="s2">perfectly transparent glass and plastic</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.110" end="00:06:27.310" style="s2">shaped in a laboratory to correct for</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.539" end="00:06:28.930" style="s2">the distortions of their own eye is</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.310" end="00:06:31.030" style="s2">really funny</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.930" end="00:06:32.770" style="s2">I mean imagine that instead of being in</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.030" end="00:06:35.590" style="s2">a frame which we&#39;ve gotten so used to</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.770" end="00:06:37.200" style="s2">somehow they were hovering this far away</p>

<p begin="00:07:53.880" end="00:07:58.170" style="s2">weird to walk around and see people with</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.580" end="00:08:01.140" style="s2">us because it is absolutely a hundred</p>

<p begin="00:08:57.290" end="00:09:01.630" style="s2">that come in but when they come in at</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.850" end="00:09:04.880" style="s2">such a such a high dollar amount we do</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.630" end="00:09:06.320" style="s2">regarding unity to sway those who are</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.880" end="00:09:08.000" style="s2">worried about the greater evil instead</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.320" end="00:09:09.530" style="s2">of using a coin flip let&#39;s declare the</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.000" end="00:09:11.840" style="s2">center-right person would be President</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.530" end="00:09:13.760" style="s2">first this would ensure that if the vote</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.840" end="00:09:18.260" style="s2">splitting that may occur most of it will</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.760" end="00:09:21.080" style="s2">be taken from the right you know I like</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.260" end="00:09:23.330" style="s2">this I toyed with an idea like that but</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.080" end="00:09:25.760" style="s2">I think the problem is this really needs</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.330" end="00:09:29.380" style="s2">to be everybody&#39;s plan this isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.760" end="00:09:33.380" style="s2">party it&#39;s not you know it is a</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.380" end="00:09:36.140" style="s2">patriotic solution to a serious problem</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.380" end="00:09:37.790" style="s2">and in order for it to be patriotic and</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.140" end="00:09:39.140" style="s2">for it to be all of us it kind of has to</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.790" end="00:09:42.140" style="s2">be balanced but I agree</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.140" end="00:09:44.140" style="s2">the problem is there are those on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.140" end="00:09:49.370" style="s2">right who don&#39;t want the election</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.140" end="00:09:52.850" style="s2">spoiled in the other direction and you</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.370" end="00:09:55.070" style="s2">know I can&#39;t even say to me we are so</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.850" end="00:09:57.170" style="s2">far gone with a system that is so broken</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.070" end="00:09:59.900" style="s2">that in the middle of kovat 19 it has</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.170" end="00:10:03.890" style="s2">delivered us these two utterly feeble</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.900" end="00:10:06.200" style="s2">candidates that we have to we have to go</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.890" end="00:10:08.780" style="s2">at this in whatever way allows our</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.200" end="00:10:10.430" style="s2">collective interests to override the</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.780" end="00:10:12.590" style="s2">interests of the duopoly which have been</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.430" end="00:10:16.520" style="s2">so thoroughly the focus of policy for</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.590" end="00:10:18.080" style="s2">for at least three decades so in any</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.520" end="00:10:20.270" style="s2">case I like the idea that there are</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.080" end="00:10:23.570" style="s2">structural biases you could build in to</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.270" end="00:10:25.550" style="s2">defeat the lesser evil paradox even</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.570" end="00:10:27.740" style="s2">further but I think the point is we</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.550" end="00:10:30.260" style="s2">defeat the lesser evil paradox in two</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.740" end="00:10:32.090" style="s2">different ways one the structural</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.260" end="00:10:34.460" style="s2">balance which we now know from the data</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.090" end="00:10:36.470" style="s2">of our volunteers who split evenly</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.460" end="00:10:39.560" style="s2">between former Trump former Biden</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.470" end="00:10:40.760" style="s2">supporters and 25% of our volunteers are</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.560" end="00:10:42.740" style="s2">people who weren&#39;t planning to vote in</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.760" end="00:10:45.770" style="s2">the first place they&#39;re going from not</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.740" end="00:10:47.000" style="s2">voting to so interested in this process</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.770" end="00:10:49.400" style="s2">that they&#39;re willing to volunteer their</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.000" end="00:10:51.110" style="s2">time that&#39;s an amazing solution to a</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.400" end="00:10:54.410" style="s2">problem that we didn&#39;t even know we were</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.110" end="00:10:56.660" style="s2">gonna solve right so it&#39;s let&#39;s just say</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.410" end="00:10:58.760" style="s2">it&#39;s working so well at the structural</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.660" end="00:11:00.770" style="s2">level that I don&#39;t think we need that</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.760" end="00:11:02.810" style="s2">third tier of solution because we have</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.770" end="00:11:05.750" style="s2">two tiers that are sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.810" end="00:11:07.940" style="s2">themselves but anyway I like to style up</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.750" end="00:11:12.080" style="s2">your thinking it does show a high</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.940" end="00:11:13.370" style="s2">quality game-theoretic mind please</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.080" end="00:11:14.990" style="s2">discuss the difference between the</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.370" end="00:11:17.150" style="s2">narratives enforced by the Daughters of</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.990" end="00:11:19.820" style="s2">the Confederacy that created our boomer</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.150" end="00:11:21.589" style="s2">and Gen X k12 history education and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.820" end="00:11:25.970" style="s2">natural desire of our contemporary lives</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.589" end="00:11:29.110" style="s2">to push back yeah I mean I like this</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.970" end="00:11:31.190" style="s2">look the problem is really simple</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.110" end="00:11:33.890" style="s2">history means two different things</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.190" end="00:11:36.560" style="s2">okay history means what happened what</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.890" end="00:11:39.320" style="s2">actually happened it also means what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.560" end="00:11:40.880" style="s2">our myth our origin story and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.320" end="00:11:43.880" style="s2">problem is that we mix these two things</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.880" end="00:11:46.880" style="s2">in the classroom and so you get lessons</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.880" end="00:11:49.940" style="s2">about how you know Christopher Columbus</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.880" end="00:11:52.100" style="s2">discovered America and no he didn&#39;t and</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.940" end="00:11:55.040" style="s2">no he didn&#39;t there was no such person</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.100" end="00:11:56.600" style="s2">and America was already inhabited by</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.040" end="00:11:58.220" style="s2">fifty to a hundred million people you</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.600" end="00:12:01.850" style="s2">can&#39;t discover something like that as I</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.220" end="00:12:05.060" style="s2">said prior in the prior livestream he</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.850" end="00:12:07.460" style="s2">discovered America in the same way that</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.060" end="00:12:09.530" style="s2">I have invented the light bulb by screw</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.460" end="00:12:14.390" style="s2">and went into the socket it&#39;s just not</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.530" end="00:12:15.589" style="s2">right so basic point we have to separate</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.390" end="00:12:18.230" style="s2">these two things we actually need to</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.589" end="00:12:19.520" style="s2">study history which means what actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.230" end="00:12:21.920" style="s2">happened the good the bad and the ugly</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.520" end="00:12:24.680" style="s2">and we need to stop mythologizing inside</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.920" end="00:12:26.420" style="s2">of our history discussions right that</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.680" end="00:12:27.620" style="s2">has to happen now that doesn&#39;t it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.420" end="00:12:28.910" style="s2">going to be a comfortable process</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.620" end="00:12:30.350" style="s2">because history is not a comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.910" end="00:12:33.470" style="s2">process and to know what actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.350" end="00:12:35.690" style="s2">happened is going to be a rough ride you</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.470" end="00:12:38.390" style="s2">should buckle up but I would suggest</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.690" end="00:12:41.480" style="s2">look we&#39;re already getting here Guns</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.390" end="00:12:43.130" style="s2">Germs and Steel the right approach right</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.480" end="00:12:46.520" style="s2">a scientific approach to history</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.130" end="00:12:48.290" style="s2">Peter Turchin and cloud dynamics same</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.520" end="00:12:50.030" style="s2">thing what are these big patterns about</p>

<p begin="00:13:08.660" end="00:13:13.730" style="s2">absolutely absolutely no this is central</p>

<p begin="00:13:13.730" end="00:13:15.480" style="s2">hasn&#39;t been part of the public</p>

<p begin="00:13:26.490" end="00:13:31.079" style="s2">to govern based on what&#39;s actually going</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.160" end="00:13:32.790" style="s2">on and their ability to hash it out</p>

<p begin="00:13:32.790" end="00:13:37.290" style="s2">get to this topic I think they&#39;d get</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.829" end="00:13:40.459" style="s2">there very very quickly so you know in</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.290" end="00:13:43.110" style="s2">some sense we are trying not to advance</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.459" end="00:13:44.579" style="s2">policy proposals or positions because</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.110" end="00:13:47.579" style="s2">that&#39;s counterproductive what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.579" end="00:13:50.250" style="s2">saying is look smart courageous Patriots</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.579" end="00:13:51.839" style="s2">that&#39;s sufficient to get to all of these</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.250" end="00:13:53.670" style="s2">big things that we haven&#39;t been able to</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.839" end="00:13:56.610" style="s2">address in the corrupt system yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.670" end="00:13:58.560" style="s2">mean I would say that you know some some</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.610" end="00:13:59.880" style="s2">of the issues that I find most pressing</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.560" end="00:14:01.649" style="s2">are things that don&#39;t show up at all</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.880" end="00:14:03.209" style="s2">that we really haven&#39;t we haven&#39;t talked</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.649" end="00:14:05.519" style="s2">about and I think don&#39;t show up in part</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.209" end="00:14:08.639" style="s2">because it&#39;s not about policy it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.519" end="00:14:10.170" style="s2">not about deciding in advance what</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.639" end="00:14:11.459" style="s2">interest groups you&#39;re going to speak to</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.170" end="00:14:14.370" style="s2">and which ones you are going to</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.459" end="00:14:16.199" style="s2">automatically get rid of by virtue of</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.370" end="00:14:18.959" style="s2">your position on something so you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.199" end="00:14:20.990" style="s2">things like things like protecting the</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.959" end="00:14:23.220" style="s2">environment and habitat loss and such</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.990" end="00:14:24.420" style="s2">aren&#39;t aren&#39;t anywhere on the docket</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.220" end="00:14:25.860" style="s2">because that&#39;s not the kind of movement</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.420" end="00:14:27.540" style="s2">it is yeah they don&#39;t need to be because</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.860" end="00:14:28.800" style="s2">you know what good people who don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.540" end="00:14:30.269" style="s2">a conflict of interest are going to</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.800" end="00:14:31.500" style="s2">protect the environment all right it</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.269" end="00:14:33.930" style="s2">doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.500" end="00:14:35.370" style="s2">going to do what any group is advocating</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.930" end="00:14:37.079" style="s2">because these groups have conflicts of</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.370" end="00:14:38.130" style="s2">interest but protect the environment</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.079" end="00:14:42.329" style="s2">that&#39;s something we should all be able</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.130" end="00:14:44.069" style="s2">to agree on hello do you have an</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.329" end="00:14:45.630" style="s2">evolutionary account for spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.069" end="00:14:48.089" style="s2">and mysticism as opposed to specific</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.630" end="00:14:50.990" style="s2">sets of religious beliefs Thank You</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.089" end="00:14:52.920" style="s2">Brett Heather and Zach for the podcast</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.990" end="00:14:54.899" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a great question</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.920" end="00:14:56.730" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a great question I would say</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.899" end="00:15:01.199" style="s2">the explanation is the same which is</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.730" end="00:15:02.819" style="s2">that there is an advantage to both a set</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.199" end="00:15:05.010" style="s2">of understood prescriptions that are</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.819" end="00:15:07.230" style="s2">delivered in a religious format and</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.010" end="00:15:09.380" style="s2">there&#39;s also an advantage to a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.230" end="00:15:13.470" style="s2">openness to things that do not</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.380" end="00:15:15.240" style="s2">necessarily derive directly from the</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.470" end="00:15:19.980" style="s2">analytical you know from introspection</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.240" end="00:15:23.730" style="s2">and so I mean it also it seems like sort</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.980" end="00:15:27.209" style="s2">of a step a step that has often happened</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.730" end="00:15:28.350" style="s2">within lineages where you start out with</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.209" end="00:15:29.320" style="s2">something that is explicitly</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.350" end="00:15:31.720" style="s2">polytheistic</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.320" end="00:15:33.760" style="s2">and then move into monotheism and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.720" end="00:15:37.750" style="s2">move into something that is you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.760" end="00:15:40.180" style="s2">does not does not proclaim a single</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.750" end="00:15:43.290" style="s2">human like God but it&#39;s something a bit</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.180" end="00:15:46.270" style="s2">more ethereal less anthropomorphic and</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.290" end="00:15:48.310" style="s2">you know all of those are related to one</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.270" end="00:15:50.170" style="s2">another but they do tend to go in that</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.310" end="00:15:53.140" style="s2">order you know a lot of the polytheistic</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.170" end="00:15:56.800" style="s2">belief systems that preceded or the</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.140" end="00:15:59.050" style="s2">judeo-christian tradition are imagined</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.800" end="00:16:01.200" style="s2">to be sort of you know spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.050" end="00:16:03.880" style="s2">mystical but they were very formalized</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.200" end="00:16:05.560" style="s2">polytheistic things you know some of</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.880" end="00:16:07.960" style="s2">what people are calling spiritual and</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.560" end="00:16:10.480" style="s2">mystical now is just a scattershot I</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.960" end="00:16:13.920" style="s2">take what I like I like to imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.480" end="00:16:16.440" style="s2">I&#39;m a mystical person and don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.920" end="00:16:19.000" style="s2">probably aren&#39;t actually descriptive of</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.440" end="00:16:21.820" style="s2">the Honorable part so if mysticism and</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.000" end="00:16:24.130" style="s2">spirituality yeah I agree I do think</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.820" end="00:16:25.810" style="s2">it&#39;s necessary that we open you know it</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.130" end="00:16:27.400" style="s2">used to be that spirituality was sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.810" end="00:16:29.920" style="s2">captured by religion because everybody</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.400" end="00:16:32.680" style="s2">had a religion yeah in an era where</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.920" end="00:16:35.140" style="s2">people are increasingly either not</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.680" end="00:16:39.010" style="s2">formally aligned with a religion or</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.140" end="00:16:42.010" style="s2">their religion is a grab-bag the</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.010" end="00:16:44.530" style="s2">necessity to separate out spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.010" end="00:16:48.910" style="s2">which is basically in some sense license</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.530" end="00:16:50.920" style="s2">to suspend the analytical in order to</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.910" end="00:16:55.240" style="s2">figure out kind of maybe it&#39;s a should</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.920" end="00:16:59.800" style="s2">part of the dynamic you know in the is</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.240" end="00:17:03.400" style="s2">odd dynamic the art separated from a</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.800" end="00:17:05.530" style="s2">rigorous obligation to is is important</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.400" end="00:17:07.839" style="s2">to the extent that you cannot derive the</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.530" end="00:17:09.760" style="s2">art directly from the is which many of</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.839" end="00:17:11.680" style="s2">us believe you can&#39;t certain people like</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.760" end="00:17:14.920" style="s2">sam harris might argue otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.680" end="00:17:18.579" style="s2">but but that but some license seems to</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.920" end="00:17:21.880" style="s2">be necessary yeah next question</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.579" end="00:17:24.339" style="s2">easy which is say Kanye West yang as the</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.880" end="00:17:28.449" style="s2">unity ticket for 2020 or 2024 question</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.339" end="00:17:34.060" style="s2">mark I sure don&#39;t think so which is not</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.449" end="00:17:36.340" style="s2">to say that West is not motivated by</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.060" end="00:17:39.460" style="s2">similar things that motivate us in fact</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.340" end="00:17:42.350" style="s2">I&#39;m sure he is I think he is a patriot</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.460" end="00:17:44.960" style="s2">he is courageous and he&#39;s concerned</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.350" end="00:17:46.789" style="s2">and so he announced his run for the</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.960" end="00:17:49.820" style="s2">presidency now my guess would be that</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.789" end="00:17:51.890" style="s2">he&#39;s going to quickly discover why his</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.820" end="00:17:54.530" style="s2">run for the presidency is very unlikely</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.890" end="00:17:56.320" style="s2">to work and why it could well play into</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.530" end="00:17:59.600" style="s2">the scenario that we have in front of us</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.320" end="00:18:02.450" style="s2">badly and so I do hope he will make</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.600" end="00:18:04.429" style="s2">contact with us because to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.450" end="00:18:06.350" style="s2">that he is trying to solve a problem for</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.429" end="00:18:09.260" style="s2">the nation which I believe he is trying</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.350" end="00:18:11.390" style="s2">to solve the best way to do that is to</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.260" end="00:18:13.370" style="s2">come talk to people who&#39;ve been thinking</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.390" end="00:18:16.549" style="s2">about this structurally and figure out</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.370" end="00:18:16.909" style="s2">if we can&#39;t align you know that would be</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.549" end="00:18:19.340" style="s2">ideal</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.909" end="00:18:21.490" style="s2">so anyway Kanye if you&#39;re out there we</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.340" end="00:18:28.429" style="s2">are absolutely open to talking and</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.490" end="00:18:30.260" style="s2">respect further to my question last week</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.429" end="00:18:32.870" style="s2">regarding UK Labour Party trumped-up</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.260" end="00:18:34.580" style="s2">anti-semitism claims party leader now</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.870" end="00:18:37.039" style="s2">backs quote unconscious bias training</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.580" end="00:18:38.570" style="s2">your thoughts do I renounce my party</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.039" end="00:18:42.530" style="s2">membership or is it or is that just</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.570" end="00:18:46.220" style="s2">letting the nonsense win that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.530" end="00:18:48.049" style="s2">question um you know I I the Labour</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.220" end="00:18:50.539" style="s2">Party you know the Labour Party and the</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.049" end="00:18:52.070" style="s2">Democrats are very similar straits it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.539" end="00:18:56.059" style="s2">all the same and so really the question</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.070" end="00:18:59.090" style="s2">is a what position are you in you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.059" end="00:19:02.120" style="s2">it may be that you can&#39;t you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.090" end="00:19:04.039" style="s2">staying within is the key to getting</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.120" end="00:19:06.080" style="s2">somewhere and that you can endure the</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.039" end="00:19:08.990" style="s2">what might come back at you as you push</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.080" end="00:19:10.970" style="s2">back from within yeah I know I know so</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.990" end="00:19:12.740" style="s2">much less about the political system in</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.970" end="00:19:14.870" style="s2">England I don&#39;t know you know in in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.740" end="00:19:16.100" style="s2">u.s. to declare yourself independent</p>

<p begin="00:19:26.840" end="00:19:30.500" style="s2">something that you can then say in</p>

<p begin="00:19:30.500" end="00:19:34.429" style="s2">and what is the value of that you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.360" end="00:19:37.549" style="s2">what are the perks that accrue to being</p>

<p begin="00:19:39.530" end="00:19:44.720" style="s2">about the British system but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.919" end="00:19:46.909" style="s2">definitely the thing that you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.720" end="00:19:48.500" style="s2">to do is empower your enemies by</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.909" end="00:19:50.150" style="s2">stepping away from the thing if you have</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.500" end="00:19:52.549" style="s2">some influence in it but maybe you have</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.150" end="00:19:54.830" style="s2">no influence that&#39;s possible too likely</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.549" end="00:19:55.940" style="s2">even what do you support a grassroots</p>

<p begin="00:20:11.919" end="00:20:17.480" style="s2">the people who are monitoring that a lot</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.830" end="00:20:18.950" style="s2">of people are saying what do I do</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.480" end="00:20:22.159" style="s2">like what so there&#39;s no ability to</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.950" end="00:20:23.779" style="s2">donate dollars at this point so what</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.159" end="00:20:26.539" style="s2">what can I do and we&#39;ve been hearing</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.779" end="00:20:28.070" style="s2">some interesting stories about people</p>

<p begin="00:20:28.070" end="00:20:30.970" style="s2">friends people who they wouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.299" end="00:20:33.919" style="s2">thought would be swayed from either</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.970" end="00:20:36.379" style="s2">Trump or Biden yeah we&#39;ve heard stories</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.919" end="00:20:38.269" style="s2">on both sides and they seem to be making</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.379" end="00:20:42.379" style="s2">headway because it actually it actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.269" end="00:20:44.600" style="s2">is a doesn&#39;t mean you have to hold your</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.379" end="00:20:46.070" style="s2">nose right this plan does not involve</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.600" end="00:20:47.090" style="s2">you having to pretend that you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.070" end="00:20:50.330" style="s2">an honorable thing when you&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.090" end="00:20:51.320" style="s2">not so this I think emerges from okay</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.330" end="00:20:53.929" style="s2">this sounds good</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.320" end="00:20:56.120" style="s2">what now what can I do okay so here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.929" end="00:20:59.419" style="s2">note say first of all get modern okay</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.120" end="00:21:01.940" style="s2">you live in the Internet era and a</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.419" end="00:21:04.009" style="s2">grassroots having people show up at your</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.940" end="00:21:05.659" style="s2">door if it&#39;s not totally not one it is</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.009" end="00:21:16.539" style="s2">also very powerful yeah although its</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.659" end="00:21:19.009" style="s2">covert 19 that&#39;s John so yeah nice so</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.539" end="00:21:21.889" style="s2">there is a lot you can do online</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.009" end="00:21:24.830" style="s2">including reach out to two or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.889" end="00:21:27.529" style="s2">three people who you think have ears to</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.830" end="00:21:29.840" style="s2">hear and what you really want to do is</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.529" end="00:21:32.750" style="s2">understand what the objections are and</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.840" end="00:21:36.529" style="s2">why they don&#39;t apply we have designed</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.750" end="00:21:37.759" style="s2">around the objections and so you want to</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.529" end="00:21:41.570" style="s2">figure out you know people have a</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.759" end="00:21:43.639" style="s2">tendency to respond to the thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.570" end="00:21:45.259" style="s2">similar to the thing you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.639" end="00:21:46.789" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.259" end="00:21:48.379" style="s2">they basically push the thing</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.789" end="00:21:49.759" style="s2">cognitively over to something they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.379" end="00:21:52.519" style="s2">familiar with oh it&#39;s a third party</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.759" end="00:21:54.620" style="s2">right no it&#39;s not there&#39;s no there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.519" end="00:21:57.019" style="s2">party this is not a third party run and</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.620" end="00:22:00.200" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t elect the greater evil</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.019" end="00:22:02.570" style="s2">because of two design elements it&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.200" end="00:22:04.879" style="s2">one element that causes it to draw</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.570" end="00:22:07.369" style="s2">equally from both sides and it&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.879" end="00:22:09.080" style="s2">another element that were it to be some</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.369" end="00:22:11.000" style="s2">danger in</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.080" end="00:22:13.880" style="s2">danger of spoiling the election the plug</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.000" end="00:22:15.920" style="s2">gets pulled so you can relax the great</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.880" end="00:22:18.110" style="s2">thing about that is you can say well who</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.920" end="00:22:19.670" style="s2">are the candidates well no this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.110" end="00:22:21.050" style="s2">about the candidates we&#39;ve told you what</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.670" end="00:22:23.570" style="s2">characteristics they will have to have</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.050" end="00:22:25.340" style="s2">right that list is sufficient to get</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.570" end="00:22:27.590" style="s2">good people to do the right thing in</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.340" end="00:22:29.000" style="s2">office you don&#39;t need to know them yet</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.590" end="00:22:31.790" style="s2">we don&#39;t know them yet it would be</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.000" end="00:22:33.830" style="s2">foolish to try to drag people in now</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.790" end="00:22:35.840" style="s2">because the effort is still small and</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.830" end="00:22:38.390" style="s2">because the effort is still small it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.840" end="00:22:40.220" style="s2">hazard to them and it&#39;s a basically the</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.390" end="00:22:42.080" style="s2">best thing that can happen is the</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.220" end="00:22:43.400" style="s2">groundswell can come and then we can</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.080" end="00:22:45.350" style="s2">declare who the candidates are and if</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.400" end="00:22:47.090" style="s2">you don&#39;t like them you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.350" end="00:22:48.770" style="s2">committing to support it you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.090" end="00:22:50.420" style="s2">committing to support something should</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.770" end="00:22:54.080" style="s2">we deliver you good candidates and</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.420" end="00:22:57.220" style="s2">should the effort be plausible at the</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.080" end="00:22:59.870" style="s2">point the election is looming and so</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.220" end="00:23:01.550" style="s2">you&#39;re not giving anything up you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.870" end="00:23:04.160" style="s2">going to do harm in the electoral</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.550" end="00:23:07.640" style="s2">context and you are basically just</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.160" end="00:23:10.250" style="s2">saying if you deliver on what it is that</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.640" end="00:23:12.260" style="s2">you say you are attempting to do then I</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.250" end="00:23:14.390" style="s2">would support it right and would you of</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.260" end="00:23:16.220" style="s2">course you would write every reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.390" end="00:23:19.190" style="s2">person would you want adults at the helm</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.220" end="00:23:21.350" style="s2">you just simply do all of us do this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.190" end="00:23:23.390" style="s2">too dangerous to have whatever else this</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.350" end="00:23:25.280" style="s2">thing you know corrupt children running</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.390" end="00:23:27.470" style="s2">things what could possibly go wrong</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.280" end="00:23:30.800" style="s2">yeah corrupt children in the bodies of</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.470" end="00:23:32.600" style="s2">adults mm-hmm Google allows us to submit</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.800" end="00:23:33.710" style="s2">questions to be answered by leaders but</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.600" end="00:23:37.520" style="s2">won&#39;t allow us to submit them</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.710" end="00:23:39.020" style="s2">anonymously therefore people avoid</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.520" end="00:23:42.850" style="s2">asking questions that may be sensitive</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.020" end="00:23:44.440" style="s2">for fear of retaliation what can I do</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.850" end="00:23:47.560" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.440" end="00:23:52.690" style="s2">what the context is here is the context</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.560" end="00:23:55.450" style="s2">this QA is the context that because this</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.690" end="00:23:57.340" style="s2">is going through YouTube that YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.450" end="00:23:58.990" style="s2">does not allow the asking of questions</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.340" end="00:24:00.850" style="s2">anonymous I have the sense that must be</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.990" end="00:24:02.140" style="s2">it seems like it might be but you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.850" end="00:24:04.270" style="s2">you can set up a YouTube channel that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.140" end="00:24:06.910" style="s2">anonymous you know it doesn&#39;t doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.270" end="00:24:08.830" style="s2">mean anything and then I&#39;m not the</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.910" end="00:24:10.570" style="s2">reason I&#39;m not sure that that&#39;s what the</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.830" end="00:24:13.110" style="s2">question is is because the word is</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.570" end="00:24:15.520" style="s2">leaders and I&#39;m not you know we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.110" end="00:24:18.070" style="s2">we might be leaders but that&#39;s not our</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.520" end="00:24:22.090" style="s2">primary role right here so I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.070" end="00:24:22.960" style="s2">what the context is enough to know more</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.090" end="00:24:25.600" style="s2">than that</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.960" end="00:24:28.930" style="s2">I don&#39;t think fear of read retaliation</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.600" end="00:24:31.230" style="s2">should be a problem here yeah but it</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.930" end="00:24:36.340" style="s2">certainly is in many places of work and</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.230" end="00:24:40.690" style="s2">other domains right now and this is a</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.340" end="00:24:43.600" style="s2">reason for I mean this is exactly why</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.690" end="00:24:46.780" style="s2">there is a strong history of being able</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.600" end="00:24:48.430" style="s2">to submit concerns anonymously and of</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.780" end="00:24:50.620" style="s2">course now that&#39;s being gamed</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.430" end="00:24:52.300" style="s2">by some workplaces where people are</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.620" end="00:24:54.990" style="s2">submitting concerns against their work</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.300" end="00:24:57.730" style="s2">against their colleagues such that</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.990" end="00:25:00.700" style="s2">they&#39;re not traceable and they&#39;re false</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.730" end="00:25:05.380" style="s2">so you know there&#39;s there&#39;s pros and</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.700" end="00:25:07.780" style="s2">cons on both sides of that 2020 and 2024</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.380" end="00:25:11.140" style="s2">are both too soon please wait till 2040</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.780" end="00:25:15.220" style="s2">and push forward as X of ticket well</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.140" end="00:25:18.100" style="s2">it&#39;s an interesting idea I&#39;m I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.220" end="00:25:20.320" style="s2">concerned that 2024 may not even be on</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.100" end="00:25:24.310" style="s2">this timeline if we are not able to</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.320" end="00:25:27.370" style="s2">divert our course so that 2040 Zach was</p>

<p begin="00:25:27.370" end="00:25:31.000" style="s2">foreign must have been born in 2005 so</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.260" end="00:25:33.550" style="s2">they would be just just old enough at</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.000" end="00:25:35.860" style="s2">that point yeah alright tell you I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.550" end="00:25:38.470" style="s2">I&#39;ll back that ticket when you advance</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.860" end="00:25:40.420" style="s2">it then if you&#39;re back you&#39;re gonna be</p>

<p begin="00:25:40.420" end="00:25:43.930" style="s2">okay this whole movement of the left is</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.520" end="00:25:45.550" style="s2">over an attempt to gain control of</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.930" end="00:25:47.440" style="s2">central government which consumes 5</p>

<p begin="00:25:52.150" end="00:25:58.720" style="s2">yeah I mean it isn&#39;t over an attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.500" end="00:26:00.730" style="s2">gain power yeah clearly please have an</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.720" end="00:26:02.620" style="s2">episode of you a progressive patriot and</p>

<p begin="00:26:02.620" end="00:26:06.610" style="s2">patriot and have the illustration of</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.240" end="00:26:08.710" style="s2">your new system system you said the</p>

<p begin="00:26:08.710" end="00:26:13.090" style="s2">to revise it etc that&#39;s a great idea</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.350" end="00:26:14.980" style="s2">yep isn&#39;t really good night here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.090" end="00:26:18.520" style="s2">thing I can&#39;t promise it&#39;s gonna happen</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.980" end="00:26:20.260" style="s2">but I&#39;m working on yeah also I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.520" end="00:26:21.910" style="s2">should we should probably have announced</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.260" end="00:26:22.990" style="s2">this at the end of last era but the end</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.910" end="00:26:24.940" style="s2">of this area should talk about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.990" end="00:26:26.560" style="s2">happening tomorrow as well is that a</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.940" end="00:26:28.600" style="s2">live stream it&#39;s not live okay but</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.560" end="00:26:30.160" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna release it soonish sooner</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.600" end="00:26:32.020" style="s2">very soon it&#39;s just a matter of fact</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.160" end="00:26:33.310" style="s2">assuming it&#39;s technically difficult so I</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.020" end="00:26:34.780" style="s2">have to pull it off first</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.310" end="00:26:36.040" style="s2">okay and I don&#39;t want to promise it but</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.780" end="00:26:37.960" style="s2">it definitely keep talking about it but</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.040" end="00:26:41.760" style="s2">not say what it is oh absolutely it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.960" end="00:26:44.830" style="s2">got great I think so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.760" end="00:26:46.270" style="s2">okay some say that some say that</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.830" end="00:26:47.560" style="s2">defunding the police means that people</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.270" end="00:26:49.060" style="s2">want to allocate some of the police</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.560" end="00:26:50.710" style="s2">budget to other programs and improve the</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.060" end="00:26:52.030" style="s2">community others say it will cause</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.710" end="00:26:54.610" style="s2">issues of the crime what are your</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.030" end="00:26:56.950" style="s2">thoughts um we&#39;ve talked about this a</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.610" end="00:26:57.460" style="s2">bit yeah it&#39;s a catastrophe and here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.950" end="00:27:01.660" style="s2">why</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.460" end="00:27:04.300" style="s2">the cops and the necessity to have so</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.660" end="00:27:07.000" style="s2">many cops and to have them so well-armed</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.300" end="00:27:09.610" style="s2">all of that is a downstream consequence</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.000" end="00:27:11.680" style="s2">of really crappy policy designed to keep</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.610" end="00:27:12.970" style="s2">people in line after you&#39;ve frozen them</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.680" end="00:27:17.880" style="s2">out of the well being that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.970" end="00:27:20.770" style="s2">entitled to so if you then reduce the</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.880" end="00:27:23.710" style="s2">level of policing and you reallocate</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.770" end="00:27:25.660" style="s2">you&#39;re not solving that upstream problem</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.710" end="00:27:27.940" style="s2">and so you&#39;re going to create a problem</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.660" end="00:27:30.210" style="s2">of not enough police so and after the</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.940" end="00:27:32.380" style="s2">symptom right grafter the symptom and</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.210" end="00:27:34.060" style="s2">some people do say that&#39;s what they mean</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.380" end="00:27:35.620" style="s2">when they say defund the police and some</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.060" end="00:27:36.910" style="s2">people do mean that but not all that</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.620" end="00:27:38.530" style="s2">mean that and some of them are quite</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.910" end="00:27:40.090" style="s2">obvious in what they&#39;re saying when they</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.530" end="00:27:42.190" style="s2">say I mean you showed a New York Times</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.090" end="00:27:43.450" style="s2">op-ed a week or two ago saying yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.190" end="00:27:45.370" style="s2">actually we do mean abolish the police</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.450" end="00:27:47.500" style="s2">we mean about no I mean the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.370" end="00:27:49.510" style="s2">there&#39;s this one phrase that actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.500" end="00:27:51.850" style="s2">means two very different things</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.510" end="00:27:52.720" style="s2">is part of the problem I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.850" end="00:27:54.790" style="s2">like calling the whole movement</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.720" end="00:27:57.040" style="s2">anti-racist when it&#39;s frankly patently</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.790" end="00:27:58.570" style="s2">not and saying oh we only mean this one</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.040" end="00:28:01.600" style="s2">thing well no actually some of you mean</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.570" end="00:28:03.250" style="s2">abolish the police entirely and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.600" end="00:28:03.830" style="s2">non-starter therefore you got to at</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.250" end="00:28:05.990" style="s2">least</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.830" end="00:28:07.090" style="s2">stop using that phrase because some</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.990" end="00:28:09.799" style="s2">people are using it to mean something</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.090" end="00:28:11.929" style="s2">impossible it would be the equivalent</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.799" end="00:28:14.029" style="s2">it&#39;s the equivalent of treating a fever</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.929" end="00:28:17.269" style="s2">when the fever is actually your body&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.029" end="00:28:19.460" style="s2">way of dealing with a pathogen so you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.269" end="00:28:20.960" style="s2">got a pathogen you say oh oh my god</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.460" end="00:28:23.120" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a pathogen you&#39;ve got a fever</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.960" end="00:28:24.470" style="s2">the fever is bad therefore get rid of</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.120" end="00:28:26.269" style="s2">the fever well now you&#39;ve got a worse</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.470" end="00:28:29.210" style="s2">problem with your pathogen right or</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.269" end="00:28:31.730" style="s2">treating pneumonia by denying the</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.210" end="00:28:33.620" style="s2">patient fluids all right you&#39;re drowning</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.730" end="00:28:35.570" style="s2">your lungs are filling with fluid let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.620" end="00:28:37.399" style="s2">let&#39;s dehydrate you well dry you right</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.570" end="00:28:39.529" style="s2">up we&#39;ll dry you right up yeah it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.399" end="00:28:42.320" style="s2">nonsense this is not going to work so</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.529" end="00:28:45.200" style="s2">it&#39;s not that people like us don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.320" end="00:28:46.429" style="s2">to see fewer police we do but we want to</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.200" end="00:28:47.960" style="s2">see fewer police by virtue of the fact</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.429" end="00:28:49.190" style="s2">that they&#39;re no longer necessary by</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.960" end="00:28:51.380" style="s2">virtue of the fact that you solve the</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.190" end="00:28:54.740" style="s2">upstream problem first it&#39;s the obvious</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.380" end="00:28:57.080" style="s2">way to go so that&#39;s it that&#39;s excellent</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.740" end="00:28:58.940" style="s2">simple as that&#39;s good like you know this</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.080" end="00:29:01.639" style="s2">is this this fever point is one that</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.940" end="00:29:04.250" style="s2">began to be being made in the 90s with</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.639" end="00:29:05.679" style="s2">as Darwinian medicine began to gain</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.250" end="00:29:08.360" style="s2">ground and then it kind of stalled out</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.679" end="00:29:10.779" style="s2">but you know the recognition that often</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.360" end="00:29:13.820" style="s2">a fever is the body&#39;s way know the</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.779" end="00:29:15.769" style="s2">body&#39;s response to the pathogen to raise</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.820" end="00:29:17.809" style="s2">the temperature in which the pathogen</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.769" end="00:29:19.880" style="s2">exists outside of its optimal zone such</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.809" end="00:29:21.980" style="s2">that the pathogen fails but not so high</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.880" end="00:29:23.269" style="s2">that the body fails that&#39;s not what all</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.980" end="00:29:25.760" style="s2">fevers are but that turns out to be what</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.269" end="00:29:28.010" style="s2">many fevers are but this the second one</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.760" end="00:29:30.350" style="s2">this well one symptom of pneumonia is</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.010" end="00:29:33.860" style="s2">that you appear to be drowning let&#39;s dry</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.350" end="00:29:37.130" style="s2">them up I think actually interjecting</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.860" end="00:29:39.620" style="s2">about these examples whenever people say</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.130" end="00:29:42.250" style="s2">defund the police it&#39;s it is it is the</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.620" end="00:29:45.440" style="s2">right analogy knee-jerk medicine yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.250" end="00:29:46.700" style="s2">yeah this is New York social change find</p>

<p begin="00:29:57.919" end="00:30:02.690" style="s2">depressed ah let&#39;s give them something</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.620" end="00:30:04.639" style="s2">to interfere with the molecules that</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.690" end="00:30:07.820" style="s2">facilitate depression do they have</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.639" end="00:30:09.470" style="s2">anything to be depressed about that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.820" end="00:30:11.090" style="s2">difficult question that&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.470" end="00:30:14.450" style="s2">complicated let alone an easier request</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.090" end="00:30:20.030" style="s2">yeah let&#39;s go after the molecules yep</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.450" end="00:30:21.980" style="s2">doot-doot where are we can&#39;t yes this is</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.030" end="00:30:23.870" style="s2">it can you speak to the concern I and</p>

<p begin="00:32:07.480" end="00:32:12.340" style="s2">okay they also made a sequel called</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.179" end="00:32:13.750" style="s2">sphere land please make a documentary on</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.340" end="00:32:16.179" style="s2">this new Maoist revolution I need</p>

<p begin="00:32:22.030" end="00:32:26.260" style="s2">flat land animated movie I do</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.010" end="00:32:28.030" style="s2">remember from just rethinking about</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.260" end="00:32:30.400" style="s2">flatland a little bit today that the</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.030" end="00:32:33.040" style="s2">more sides you have in 2d land the more</p>

<p begin="00:32:39.970" end="00:32:45.610" style="s2">first printing was a square but every</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.010" end="00:32:49.240" style="s2">tie there every time you a generation</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.610" end="00:32:50.710" style="s2">will change I think you add a side so</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.240" end="00:32:52.500" style="s2">the child of a squares of Pentagon if</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.710" end="00:32:54.790" style="s2">he&#39;s male the childhood Pentagon is a</p>

<p begin="00:32:57.940" end="00:33:02.020" style="s2">just stabilized as squares in which case</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.559" end="00:33:05.080" style="s2">they haven&#39;t quite solved it no that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.020" end="00:33:06.160" style="s2">not not a whole solution yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.080" end="00:33:08.650" style="s2">interesting point though thanks that</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.160" end="00:33:10.210" style="s2">report enough to it curious as to your</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.650" end="00:33:12.460" style="s2">thoughts on the warnings that Yuri</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.210" end="00:33:14.770" style="s2">basmanov gave us in 1984 after he</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.460" end="00:33:16.330" style="s2">defected he is an ex-kgb agent and it</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.770" end="00:33:17.650" style="s2">basically mirrors your experiences and</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.330" end="00:33:20.800" style="s2">everything you&#39;ve been saying regarding</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.650" end="00:33:23.470" style="s2">evergreen yeah I would</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.800" end="00:33:25.179" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen some of his interviews I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.470" end="00:33:26.830" style="s2">there&#39;s like one longish one maybe an</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.179" end="00:33:30.370" style="s2">hour and a half or so but they&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.830" end="00:33:33.309" style="s2">couple and he just peaced saw it he saw</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.370" end="00:33:35.920" style="s2">it in the USSR and he came here and he</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.309" end="00:33:37.840" style="s2">said wow you guys have the the</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.920" end="00:33:39.970" style="s2">glimmerings of the same kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.840" end="00:33:42.580" style="s2">and I&#39;m gonna predict these these things</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.970" end="00:33:45.400" style="s2">and he just got a lot of them right so</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.580" end="00:33:46.840" style="s2">this is Yuri bez enough I think yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.400" end="00:33:48.850" style="s2">the thing to understand is that this is</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.840" end="00:33:52.720" style="s2">the canonical failure and exactly a set</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.850" end="00:33:55.030" style="s2">of canonical failures so you have what I</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.720" end="00:33:56.890" style="s2">call the French Revolution moment which</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.030" end="00:33:59.890" style="s2">means the point at which the rent</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.890" end="00:34:01.809" style="s2">seekers have frozen regular people out</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.890" end="00:34:04.720" style="s2">of well-being for so long that the</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.809" end="00:34:06.850" style="s2">regular people think I know you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.720" end="00:34:08.230" style="s2">pitchforks and torches right and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.850" end="00:34:11.350" style="s2">next thing it&#39;s guillotines that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.230" end="00:34:13.629" style="s2">French flair right but but the point is</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.350" end="00:34:15.940" style="s2">if you&#39;ve got run seeking elites and</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.629" end="00:34:16.929" style="s2">they freeze people out long enough what</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.940" end="00:34:20.829" style="s2">will happen</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.929" end="00:34:23.559" style="s2">those people will revolt and so another</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.829" end="00:34:25.929" style="s2">canonical failure is this instinct to</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.559" end="00:34:28.540" style="s2">you know solve everything through</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.929" end="00:34:33.490" style="s2">redistribution which then runs afoul of</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.540" end="00:34:35.440" style="s2">a a group selection problem it&#39;s got a</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.490" end="00:34:37.659" style="s2">game theory problem at its heart if then</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.440" end="00:34:39.159" style="s2">forces you to authoritarianism so the</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.659" end="00:34:42.099" style="s2">real point is look let&#39;s just get good</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.159" end="00:34:44.020" style="s2">at saying if you do that the next thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.099" end="00:34:45.309" style="s2">that happens is this if that happens the</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.020" end="00:34:46.839" style="s2">next thing I happens is this and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.309" end="00:34:48.159" style="s2">how you end up with that thing that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.839" end="00:34:49.839" style="s2">dramatic and everybody says how could</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.159" end="00:34:52.240" style="s2">this have happened but does it look like</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.839" end="00:34:55.089" style="s2">last time right well but it does it just</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.240" end="00:34:56.679" style="s2">got a new tech yeah it&#39;s yeah what it</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.089" end="00:34:57.849" style="s2">updates and you know for one thing the</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.679" end="00:34:59.800" style="s2">things that you&#39;re easy that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.849" end="00:35:02.680" style="s2">easily gonna spot those things are</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.800" end="00:35:04.960" style="s2">understood to be deal breakers and so it</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.680" end="00:35:06.910" style="s2">learns you know fascism isn&#39;t gonna go</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.960" end="00:35:07.960" style="s2">step again it learn it&#39;s learned yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.910" end="00:35:09.880" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.960" end="00:35:11.829" style="s2">yeah these these people who are like did</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.880" end="00:35:14.920" style="s2">you see he did a he did a Heil Hitler</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.829" end="00:35:16.270" style="s2">it&#39;s like only a true moron would make</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.920" end="00:35:17.859" style="s2">that part of the movement at this point</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.270" end="00:35:21.700" style="s2">like it&#39;s not gonna look like that of</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.859" end="00:35:24.160" style="s2">course it&#39;s not do you think CRISPR ooh</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.700" end="00:35:25.900" style="s2">biology question do you think CRISPR may</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.160" end="00:35:28.450" style="s2">be needed to stop kovat if it mutates</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.900" end="00:35:29.650" style="s2">too fast for traditional vaccines what</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.450" end="00:35:31.750" style="s2">are the major concerns you have with</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.650" end="00:35:32.490" style="s2">this technology thanks and keep up the</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.750" end="00:35:40.480" style="s2">great work</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.490" end="00:35:42.369" style="s2">hmmm I don&#39;t know if CRISPR can be I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.480" end="00:35:43.900" style="s2">not I spent a while since I&#39;ve thought</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.369" end="00:35:46.420" style="s2">about CRISPR I don&#39;t know how it can be</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.900" end="00:35:50.250" style="s2">used to to address kovat if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.420" end="00:35:53.410" style="s2">mutating really fast so it can be used</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.250" end="00:35:55.180" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t need to be used</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.410" end="00:35:56.650" style="s2">because we have other techniques to do</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.180" end="00:35:57.970" style="s2">the same thing it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.650" end="00:36:00.010" style="s2">the most efficient way to do those</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.970" end="00:36:03.460" style="s2">things but the thing to understand about</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.010" end="00:36:06.400" style="s2">CRISPR is that I have analogized it too</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.460" end="00:36:08.619" style="s2">we have a typewriter for the language of</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.400" end="00:36:10.839" style="s2">genes and that typewriter is CRISPR what</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.619" end="00:36:12.790" style="s2">we don&#39;t have is the rosetta stone we</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.839" end="00:36:14.170" style="s2">the humans of a typewriter the genes</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.790" end="00:36:16.000" style="s2">themselves have whatever they&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.170" end="00:36:17.319" style="s2">let&#39;s do their thing and we now have a</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.000" end="00:36:20.049" style="s2">typewriter that allows us to make any</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.319" end="00:36:21.849" style="s2">sequence we like right we know what the</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.049" end="00:36:23.710" style="s2">letters are we know what the letters are</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.849" end="00:36:25.210" style="s2">and we can assemble them at will but we</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.710" end="00:36:27.010" style="s2">don&#39;t speak the language of those</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.210" end="00:36:29.049" style="s2">letters yet we&#39;re learning things about</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.010" end="00:36:30.730" style="s2">that language but without the rosetta</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.049" end="00:36:32.830" style="s2">stone we don&#39;t speak the language</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.730" end="00:36:35.170" style="s2">means we can&#39;t sit down and say let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.830" end="00:36:37.900" style="s2">write a gene to do X and we&#39;ve got so</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.170" end="00:36:40.240" style="s2">much hubris you know the the molecular</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.900" end="00:36:41.680" style="s2">biologists are so sure that they&#39;ve that</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.240" end="00:36:44.230" style="s2">they&#39;ve got this mailed in so many</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.680" end="00:36:46.450" style="s2">regards that changes are often done</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.230" end="00:36:47.920" style="s2">without regard to you know things like</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.450" end="00:36:51.730" style="s2">Chesterton&#39;s fence unattended</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.920" end="00:36:55.119" style="s2">consequences it&#39;s it&#39;s dangerous so I</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.730" end="00:36:57.430" style="s2">would say I&#39;ve seen efforts in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.119" end="00:36:59.850" style="s2">neighborhood of vaccines and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.430" end="00:37:02.109" style="s2">efforts which is currently being</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.850" end="00:37:04.359" style="s2">suppressed it would seem by our</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.109" end="00:37:08.080" style="s2">top-level journals makes the following</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.359" end="00:37:14.440" style="s2">point in their manuscript about vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.080" end="00:37:19.540" style="s2">technology which is these pathogens have</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.440" end="00:37:22.420" style="s2">high variability in terms of their rate</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.540" end="00:37:24.369" style="s2">of change and that a vaccine that is</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.420" end="00:37:26.040" style="s2">targeted at something that changes</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.369" end="00:37:29.380" style="s2">rapidly is obviously a short duration</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.040" end="00:37:32.290" style="s2">phenomenon and one can systematically go</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.380" end="00:37:34.000" style="s2">through the the genome and the</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.290" end="00:37:35.830" style="s2">structures and you can target things to</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.000" end="00:37:38.230" style="s2">change less frequently which seems a</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.830" end="00:37:41.440" style="s2">very obvious point but nonetheless there</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.230" end="00:37:43.300" style="s2">are oh it also makes another point which</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.440" end="00:37:46.300" style="s2">is target things that are as far from</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.300" end="00:37:48.670" style="s2">human sequences as possible right to the</p>

<p begin="00:37:53.140" end="00:37:57.160" style="s2">are most different because those parts</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.180" end="00:37:59.109" style="s2">then do not confuse the immune system</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.160" end="00:38:01.030" style="s2">and attacking itself and creating an</p>

<p begin="00:38:01.030" end="00:38:05.410" style="s2">is a way to play this game and the idea</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.430" end="00:38:08.290" style="s2">that we are going to because the vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.410" end="00:38:10.150" style="s2">in question is being developed by people</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.290" end="00:38:12.460" style="s2">who through their research have</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.150" end="00:38:14.650" style="s2">discovered just how probable it is that</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.460" end="00:38:18.369" style="s2">the virus emerged from a laboratory</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.650" end="00:38:20.440" style="s2">after having been modified that we are</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.369" end="00:38:23.740" style="s2">going to shut down that discussion and</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.440" end="00:38:26.200" style="s2">thereby slow the progress on that</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.740" end="00:38:28.960" style="s2">vaccine is appalling because frankly</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.200" end="00:38:31.089" style="s2">that could very easily lead to a great</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.960" end="00:38:33.009" style="s2">many needless deaths</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.089" end="00:38:35.739" style="s2">one more question here then we&#39;ll skip</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.009" end="00:38:38.499" style="s2">to switch to the other live stream super</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.739" end="00:38:40.059" style="s2">chat are we in the it&#39;s just the flu</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.499" end="00:38:41.380" style="s2">phase of public awareness of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.059" end="00:38:44.950" style="s2">horizontal revolution</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.380" end="00:38:47.079" style="s2">I like this framing very much me too</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.950" end="00:38:49.809" style="s2">I mean it&#39;ll like it but I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.079" end="00:38:51.969" style="s2">apt I like that yeah I like it I like it</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.809" end="00:38:54.430" style="s2">a lot yeah yeah and you know you can</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.969" end="00:38:57.089" style="s2">tell in some sense this is drawn out</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.430" end="00:38:59.680" style="s2">because some of us have seen the</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.089" end="00:39:02.440" style="s2">horizontal resolution obviously in</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.680" end="00:39:04.690" style="s2">microcosm before and we&#39;ve been talking</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.440" end="00:39:08.019" style="s2">about it we were long dismissed and the</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.690" end="00:39:10.420" style="s2">point is if it is true that we were</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.019" end="00:39:12.369" style="s2">right that the thing that we saw in</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.420" end="00:39:13.900" style="s2">miniature has now emerged at a much</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.369" end="00:39:16.119" style="s2">greater scale and we told you it was</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.900" end="00:39:17.920" style="s2">going to then what are we saying now</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.119" end="00:39:20.200" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re saying oh my god that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.920" end="00:39:22.660" style="s2">threat to the overall power structure</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.200" end="00:39:24.940" style="s2">and the worst thing that can happen is</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.660" end="00:39:27.880" style="s2">that it can partner with half of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.940" end="00:39:29.890" style="s2">duopoly right and that&#39;s bouches two</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.880" end="00:39:31.809" style="s2">reasons one if it partners with half of</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.890" end="00:39:33.700" style="s2">the duopoly what&#39;s gonna happen well hey</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.809" end="00:39:36.069" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna get this massive transfer</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.700" end="00:39:38.469" style="s2">of well-being based on nothing like</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.069" end="00:39:42.009" style="s2">justice whatsoever that is going to</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.469" end="00:39:43.299" style="s2">cause misery and the whole point of it</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.009" end="00:39:46.079" style="s2">is to distract from where the</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.299" end="00:39:48.910" style="s2">opportunity was actually concentrated or</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.079" end="00:39:51.489" style="s2">equally bad or maybe worse is that</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.910" end="00:39:53.710" style="s2">that&#39;s going to activate people on the</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.489" end="00:39:57.729" style="s2">other side to fight back and we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.710" end="00:40:00.190" style="s2">find ourselves in a another race-based</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.729" end="00:40:01.690" style="s2">civil war which doesn&#39;t even have the</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.190" end="00:40:03.670" style="s2">advantage of having a geographical</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.690" end="00:40:06.009" style="s2">description that could possibly tell us</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.670" end="00:40:09.009" style="s2">how it might be resolved so this is this</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.009" end="00:40:12.700" style="s2">is why the alarm bells are going off is</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.009" end="00:40:15.180" style="s2">that the duopoly and not donald trump</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.700" end="00:40:17.319" style="s2">the duopoly it&#39;s a long-standing</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.180" end="00:40:20.049" style="s2">conspiracy against the american public</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.319" end="00:40:22.930" style="s2">the way it conducts well-being and</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.049" end="00:40:25.210" style="s2">concentrates it with rent-seeking elites</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.930" end="00:40:28.420" style="s2">that thing has created the problem and</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.210" end="00:40:30.549" style="s2">now it is giving us no viable solution</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.420" end="00:40:34.869" style="s2">that does not result in disaster for the</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.549" end="00:40:37.260" style="s2">country so yeah I agree it ain&#39;t the flu</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.869" end="00:40:39.730" style="s2">yeah sorry</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.260" end="00:40:41.050" style="s2">might males be selecting for fitter</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.730" end="00:40:43.150" style="s2">offspring when imposing additional</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.050" end="00:40:45.040" style="s2">burdens on females during mating through</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.150" end="00:40:47.230" style="s2">biting or hurting so weak females can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.040" end="00:40:50.110" style="s2">live or carry offspring to term thanks</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.230" end="00:40:52.720" style="s2">love you guys wait what um can you help</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.110" end="00:40:56.500" style="s2">me I didn&#39;t quite get it the the</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.720" end="00:41:01.720" style="s2">proposal is that male aggression against</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.500" end="00:41:03.580" style="s2">females during mating is a way of</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.720" end="00:41:06.840" style="s2">increasing the fitness of their own</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.580" end="00:41:10.660" style="s2">offspring this this probably isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.840" end="00:41:13.810" style="s2">because females are always limiting for</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.660" end="00:41:15.790" style="s2">males and as you know assuming we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.810" end="00:41:17.700" style="s2">talking about a species in which there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.790" end="00:41:19.900" style="s2">no paternal care and basically in which</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.700" end="00:41:22.060" style="s2">males try to mate with as many females</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.900" end="00:41:25.480" style="s2">as possible and females are stuck with</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.060" end="00:41:29.530" style="s2">whatever they have the monopoly on the</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.480" end="00:41:34.270" style="s2">parental care such that there is any the</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.530" end="00:41:38.830" style="s2">females are a resource that even if</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.270" end="00:41:40.030" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a group of offspring</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.830" end="00:41:41.560" style="s2">that get produced that aren&#39;t as</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.030" end="00:41:43.450" style="s2">high-quality as they might be there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.560" end="00:41:45.820" style="s2">still offspring and conditions change</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.450" end="00:41:46.320" style="s2">and what doesn&#39;t work now might work in</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.820" end="00:41:49.630" style="s2">the future</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.320" end="00:41:51.550" style="s2">so in general killing males killing</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.630" end="00:41:53.050" style="s2">females is not going to be a viable</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.550" end="00:41:54.820" style="s2">strategy and not one that evolution is</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.050" end="00:41:56.140" style="s2">going to see is viable either especially</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.820" end="00:41:57.820" style="s2">females who are mating with them which</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.140" end="00:42:00.100" style="s2">is I realize included in what you just</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.820" end="00:42:02.890" style="s2">said but yeah there&#39;s nothing down that</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.100" end="00:42:03.700" style="s2">road so you know why does that thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.890" end="00:42:06.310" style="s2">exist</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.700" end="00:42:08.050" style="s2">you&#39;re a how much does it exist we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.310" end="00:42:09.670" style="s2">know and this is people this image that</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.050" end="00:42:12.190" style="s2">calls that comes to mind and you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.670" end="00:42:14.980" style="s2">non-human just like lions you know cats</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.190" end="00:42:16.330" style="s2">end up so dividing the male cats end up</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.980" end="00:42:20.050" style="s2">biting female cats on the nape of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.330" end="00:42:23.860" style="s2">neck yeah this is rough yeah yeah so the</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.050" end="00:42:25.510" style="s2">nape is that different no it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.860" end="00:42:30.160" style="s2">scruff for sure you stuff them right</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.510" end="00:42:31.390" style="s2">anyway which I mean in the case of cats</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.160" end="00:42:34.270" style="s2">I think it&#39;s straightforward if you take</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.390" end="00:42:38.080" style="s2">a adult cat and you scruff them it</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.270" end="00:42:40.780" style="s2">causes them to to relax and and not</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.080" end="00:42:42.790" style="s2">struggle right but that I mean then this</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.780" end="00:42:46.270" style="s2">raises a different question about why</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.790" end="00:42:47.800" style="s2">any coercion is necessary right right I</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.270" end="00:42:49.060" style="s2">mean that&#39;s a that&#39;s a different</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.800" end="00:42:50.789" style="s2">question though that it&#39;s not there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.060" end="00:42:53.670" style="s2">not harm</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.789" end="00:42:56.880" style="s2">being there&#39;s no intentional harm being</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.670" end="00:42:59.009" style="s2">inflicted there yeah okay please talk</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.880" end="00:43:00.690" style="s2">about the h-1b issue and how it related</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.009" end="00:43:04.349" style="s2">to Eric&#39;s theory of minorities in stem</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.690" end="00:43:06.299" style="s2">or the Princeton faculty letter I have</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.349" end="00:43:07.529" style="s2">to admit that I haven&#39;t fully spent time</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.299" end="00:43:12.539" style="s2">with the Princeton faculty letter yet</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.529" end="00:43:15.630" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen it but I don&#39;t yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.539" end="00:43:17.759" style="s2">probably you should direct this at Eric</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.630" end="00:43:22.859" style="s2">I don&#39;t think I want to wade into it</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.759" end="00:43:24.150" style="s2">without being fully well-versed someone</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.859" end="00:43:26.640" style="s2">offers their support saying it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.150" end="00:43:27.000" style="s2">very much but they&#39;re poor well thank</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.640" end="00:43:31.190" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.000" end="00:43:35.849" style="s2">yeah thanks and if you&#39;re poor probably</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.190" end="00:43:38.039" style="s2">save it yeah I would say but thank you</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.849" end="00:43:39.450" style="s2">regarding the spoiler issue guys you</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.039" end="00:43:40.650" style="s2">can&#39;t turn a cruise ship on a dime and</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.450" end="00:43:41.910" style="s2">you can&#39;t do anything but spoil an</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.650" end="00:43:45.990" style="s2">election in four months you&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.910" end="00:43:47.549" style="s2">naive I love you well we love you too I</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.990" end="00:43:48.779" style="s2">don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.549" end="00:43:49.920" style="s2">thing is designed not to spoil the</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.779" end="00:43:52.890" style="s2">election what are you worried about</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.920" end="00:43:56.640" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s designed this way in two</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.890" end="00:43:59.339" style="s2">separate ways we&#39;ve got a by design that</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.640" end="00:44:01.500" style="s2">we now know is working mechanism whereby</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.339" end="00:44:03.960" style="s2">it draws equally from both and it&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.500" end="00:44:07.710" style="s2">a fail-safe it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s safe twice</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.960" end="00:44:09.690" style="s2">over so yep if religion is inevitable</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.710" end="00:44:11.250" style="s2">doesn&#39;t it make sense to use science to</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.690" end="00:44:12.779" style="s2">carefully design a new religion such</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.250" end="00:44:14.369" style="s2">that it&#39;s negative externalities are</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.779" end="00:44:17.910" style="s2">minimized rather than let harmful new</p>

<p begin="00:44:31.769" end="00:44:36.420" style="s2">invent a religion or is this doomed to</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.140" end="00:44:38.220" style="s2">failure if we don&#39;t do that hmm and I</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.420" end="00:44:40.349" style="s2">think it&#39;s the wrong question first of</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.220" end="00:44:42.390" style="s2">all there&#39;s a problem with building this</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.349" end="00:44:44.339" style="s2">in at the religious level which is the</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.390" end="00:44:47.039" style="s2">religious level because it is inherently</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.339" end="00:44:49.589" style="s2">metaphorical does not have a mechanism</p>

<p begin="00:44:49.589" end="00:44:53.700" style="s2">the thing is predicated have changed</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.539" end="00:44:55.769" style="s2">sufficiently that the myth is no longer</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.700" end="00:44:58.380" style="s2">viable in other words the way religions</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.769" end="00:45:00.480" style="s2">change is by those who ascribe to</p>

<p begin="00:45:01.019" end="00:45:05.290" style="s2">yeah it is</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.340" end="00:45:06.610" style="s2">optically resistant to fact-checking so</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.290" end="00:45:08.920" style="s2">what you&#39;ve got is sectarian</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.610" end="00:45:10.600" style="s2">disagreement over what the true nature</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.920" end="00:45:12.670" style="s2">of the religion is and then the groups</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.600" end="00:45:14.290" style="s2">that have it closer to right out compete</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.670" end="00:45:15.910" style="s2">the groups that have it less right we</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.290" end="00:45:18.010" style="s2">can&#39;t afford that we have to have</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.910" end="00:45:20.860" style="s2">something that self updates what does</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.010" end="00:45:23.380" style="s2">that scientific worldview but you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.860" end="00:45:26.430" style="s2">want a narrow empiricist scientific</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.380" end="00:45:30.280" style="s2">world you want a broad-minded Systems</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.430" end="00:45:32.770" style="s2">Theory mechanism that tells you which of</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.280" end="00:45:34.720" style="s2">your you know what is stacked on top of</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.770" end="00:45:39.100" style="s2">which beliefs such that you know this</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.720" end="00:45:40.390" style="s2">belief may not be very if it&#39;s wrong it</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.100" end="00:45:41.650" style="s2">may not be very important because</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.390" end="00:45:46.050" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing stacked on it where is</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.650" end="00:45:48.310" style="s2">this belief if it&#39;s wrong is a terrible</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.050" end="00:45:50.890" style="s2">vulnerability and so you need to have</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.310" end="00:45:52.930" style="s2">some understanding of what&#39;s predicated</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.890" end="00:45:54.700" style="s2">on what and therefore what needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.930" end="00:45:56.530" style="s2">checked at what rate and what level of</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.700" end="00:45:58.360" style="s2">accuracy it has to have in order to</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.530" end="00:46:00.280" style="s2">retain its nature and what would cause</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.360" end="00:46:02.860" style="s2">you to change something in order to</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.280" end="00:46:04.720" style="s2">avoid something downstream we know how</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.860" end="00:46:06.760" style="s2">to do it it&#39;s not that hard to figure</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.720" end="00:46:12.120" style="s2">out how to do it and I just think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.760" end="00:46:14.440" style="s2">incompatible with any system that claims</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.120" end="00:46:16.300" style="s2">absolute truth right</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.440" end="00:46:18.280" style="s2">now the scientific method will lead you</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.300" end="00:46:19.720" style="s2">in a direction of the truth but it</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.280" end="00:46:22.180" style="s2">doesn&#39;t claim absolute truth there is</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.720" end="00:46:23.530" style="s2">nothing that we know that you know for</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.180" end="00:46:25.840" style="s2">one thing you hear people talking about</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.530" end="00:46:27.820" style="s2">the simulation hypothesis for the</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.840" end="00:46:30.040" style="s2">universe virtually everything we know</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.820" end="00:46:32.680" style="s2">about what&#39;s in the universe isn&#39;t true</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.040" end="00:46:34.210" style="s2">if the universe is a simulation right</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.680" end="00:46:36.820" style="s2">nothing is true does the earth go around</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.210" end="00:46:39.730" style="s2">the Sun no not if it&#39;s a simulation all</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.820" end="00:46:41.170" style="s2">right so so the point is look we&#39;re open</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.730" end="00:46:42.400" style="s2">to all those things I don&#39;t think you</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.170" end="00:46:45.100" style="s2">have need to worry that the universe is</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.400" end="00:46:46.750" style="s2">a simulation but everything is on the</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.100" end="00:46:48.700" style="s2">table in science all the time and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.750" end="00:46:50.290" style="s2">the way it needs to be and unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.700" end="00:46:53.380" style="s2">that&#39;s the Achilles heel of all</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.290" end="00:46:56.320" style="s2">religions is that they don&#39;t do that yep</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.380" end="00:46:59.080" style="s2">I wrote an essay on the importance of</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.320" end="00:47:00.820" style="s2">semantics redefinition redefinition and</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.080" end="00:47:03.130" style="s2">broadening of terms like racism violence</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.820" end="00:47:05.080" style="s2">and self-defense do you agree that</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.130" end="00:47:06.820" style="s2">semantic distinctions drive much of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.080" end="00:47:09.640" style="s2">current confusion and how best can we</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.820" end="00:47:11.980" style="s2">deal with it I don&#39;t know where I&#39;d put</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.640" end="00:47:13.660" style="s2">it in the pecking order but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.980" end="00:47:16.080" style="s2">certainly a tool that has been used that</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.660" end="00:47:19.170" style="s2">it was recognized by the academics who</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.080" end="00:47:21.660" style="s2">the sort of revolution in in academia</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.170" end="00:47:24.600" style="s2">that helped get us into this mess</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.660" end="00:47:29.520" style="s2">redefining language was a primary mode</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.600" end="00:47:34.920" style="s2">of dissemination and of confusion yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.520" end="00:47:37.530" style="s2">think the the flaw is that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.920" end="00:47:40.260" style="s2">mindset that mistakes the truth for</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.530" end="00:47:41.850" style="s2">social right there is a truth and then</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.260" end="00:47:44.910" style="s2">there is a social layer at which we</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.850" end="00:47:47.190" style="s2">engage the truth if you think that</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.910" end="00:47:50.460" style="s2">everything is social then the world is</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.190" end="00:47:53.850" style="s2">effectively like the Internet and you</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.460" end="00:47:54.630" style="s2">can you know on the Internet can a man</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.850" end="00:47:57.510" style="s2">become a woman</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.630" end="00:47:59.100" style="s2">yeah you can sign up for a new account</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.510" end="00:48:00.720" style="s2">and say he&#39;s a woman and he&#39;s a woman</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.100" end="00:48:02.790" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t mean that the person</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.720" end="00:48:05.160" style="s2">sitting at the keyboard has changed who</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.790" end="00:48:07.200" style="s2">what they are but it means that in an</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.160" end="00:48:09.440" style="s2">online world that has no physics that</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.200" end="00:48:12.810" style="s2">has no conservation laws that has no</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.440" end="00:48:14.880" style="s2">absolute logic you know the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.810" end="00:48:17.310" style="s2">code has an absolute logic but online</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.880" end="00:48:19.410" style="s2">you can set up a world that does</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.310" end="00:48:21.360" style="s2">anything and so if you are raised in</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.410" end="00:48:25.110" style="s2">that world and you don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.360" end="00:48:26.550" style="s2">understand that the world outside is of</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.110" end="00:48:28.260" style="s2">a different nature that it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.550" end="00:48:30.830" style="s2">really care what you think right that it</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.260" end="00:48:32.580" style="s2">is a set of processes that happen</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.830" end="00:48:36.690" style="s2">irrespective of whether or not you</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.580" end="00:48:39.270" style="s2">understand them then you will tend to</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.690" end="00:48:42.090" style="s2">fight your battles in this social layer</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.270" end="00:48:43.860" style="s2">because the point is look you who say</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.090" end="00:48:45.930" style="s2">that a man cannot become alone by saying</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.860" end="00:48:47.460" style="s2">that he&#39;s a woman are standing in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.930" end="00:48:49.470" style="s2">way of people who want to do exactly</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.460" end="00:48:50.940" style="s2">that why would you stand in the way</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.470" end="00:48:52.650" style="s2">because it&#39;s as simple as us all</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.940" end="00:48:54.300" style="s2">agreeing to this so if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.650" end="00:48:56.250" style="s2">liberate people let&#39;s all agree to it</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.300" end="00:48:57.690" style="s2">and the answer is no because you&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.250" end="00:49:00.870" style="s2">said something that interfaces with</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.690" end="00:49:02.490" style="s2">biology and medicine and the prison</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.870" end="00:49:05.640" style="s2">system and the courts and all of these</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.490" end="00:49:07.380" style="s2">other things and and sport so you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.640" end="00:49:09.900" style="s2">there&#39;s no escaping the fact that those</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.380" end="00:49:11.310" style="s2">realms have a physical reality when they</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.900" end="00:49:13.050" style="s2">put you in prison you can&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.310" end="00:49:14.970" style="s2">identify as somebody who&#39;s not in prison</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.050" end="00:49:16.500" style="s2">all right prison is that an actual place</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.970" end="00:49:18.480" style="s2">we take away your freedom and we do it</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.500" end="00:49:20.310" style="s2">on the basis of facts established in a</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.480" end="00:49:22.920" style="s2">court that tell us that you violated a</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.310" end="00:49:25.260" style="s2">law sufficiently important that it</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.920" end="00:49:27.480" style="s2">warrants prison time all right those are</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.260" end="00:49:29.130" style="s2">yes there&#39;s a social layer the court is</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.480" end="00:49:30.320" style="s2">a social layer but the bars of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.130" end="00:49:35.240" style="s2">prisoner not</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.320" end="00:49:37.580" style="s2">so I would say to people who have seen</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.240" end="00:49:40.250" style="s2">much happen in the social world and have</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.580" end="00:49:42.220" style="s2">not fully engaged the boundary between</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.250" end="00:49:44.960" style="s2">the social world and the physical world</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.220" end="00:49:47.300" style="s2">there is a confusion and that results in</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.960" end="00:49:51.850" style="s2">us fighting linguistic battles as if</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.300" end="00:49:56.450" style="s2">they are the same thing as reality end</p>

<p begin="00:50:29.990" end="00:50:33.410" style="s2">biblical scholars and we don&#39;t pretend</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.310" end="00:50:35.720" style="s2">to be we&#39;re evolutionary biologists so I</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.410" end="00:50:38.120" style="s2">have not watched dr. Peterson&#39;s Genesis</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.720" end="00:50:39.860" style="s2">series but I imagine that in that as in</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.120" end="00:50:42.590" style="s2">everything I have seen of his he does a</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.860" end="00:50:45.200" style="s2">really bang-up job yep I think I now</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.590" end="00:50:48.790" style="s2">recall what they&#39;re talking about okay I</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.200" end="00:50:51.650" style="s2">think we talked about virgin birth</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.790" end="00:50:53.480" style="s2">so the mythical aspects of crucial</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.650" end="00:50:55.780" style="s2">aspect of Christianity and the answer is</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.480" end="00:50:57.830" style="s2">all Smet afore eclis true this is not</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.780" end="00:50:59.570" style="s2">something for which there is a good</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.830" end="00:51:01.550" style="s2">solution on the one hand we are</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.570" end="00:51:04.490" style="s2">biologists the idea of virgin birth</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.550" end="00:51:05.900" style="s2">that&#39;s an empirical claim and the fact</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.490" end="00:51:07.490" style="s2">that that claim is in there I find very</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.900" end="00:51:09.770" style="s2">unfortunate because what it means is</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.490" end="00:51:11.690" style="s2">that there is a an empirical barrier to</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.770" end="00:51:14.090" style="s2">people seeing the wisdom of things like</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.690" end="00:51:15.920" style="s2">the golden rule in the story of the Good</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.090" end="00:51:17.420" style="s2">Samaritan which we&#39;d be much better off</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.920" end="00:51:18.710" style="s2">if there were no barrier to seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.420" end="00:51:21.740" style="s2">wisdom there because those aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.710" end="00:51:23.570" style="s2">empirical claims well I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.740" end="00:51:24.860" style="s2">actually it speaks to it you know what</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.570" end="00:51:26.570" style="s2">you call the soapbox in the last</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.860" end="00:51:30.140" style="s2">question you know we are we are no more</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.570" end="00:51:31.940" style="s2">going to agree that Jesus was actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.140" end="00:51:34.100" style="s2">the result of a virgin birth from his</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.940" end="00:51:35.600" style="s2">mother than we are that men can</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.100" end="00:51:37.250" style="s2">literally become women by declaring</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.600" end="00:51:38.450" style="s2">themselves so they&#39;re they&#39;re equally</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.250" end="00:51:40.970" style="s2">empirical claims and they&#39;re equally</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.450" end="00:51:42.320" style="s2">wrong well and interestingly the the</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.970" end="00:51:43.520" style="s2">version of this that you have picked</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.320" end="00:51:46.190" style="s2">somebody who ascribe</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.520" end="00:51:49.190" style="s2">to a biblical literalism enough that</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.190" end="00:51:52.490" style="s2">that virgin birth is important to them</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.190" end="00:51:54.890" style="s2">is very likely not to like the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.490" end="00:51:56.450" style="s2">somebody simply changes sex by saying so</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.890" end="00:51:58.100" style="s2">well that&#39;s so that&#39;s why I picked those</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.450" end="00:51:59.930" style="s2">two these are at opposite ends I&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.100" end="00:52:01.850" style="s2">like no you can&#39;t go after my cherished</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.930" end="00:52:03.710" style="s2">beliefs like well sometimes cherished</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.850" end="00:52:05.990" style="s2">beliefs are wrong well not only are they</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.710" end="00:52:09.160" style="s2">wrong but the point is it&#39;s certainly</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.990" end="00:52:11.630" style="s2">wrong to say this cherished belief is</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.160" end="00:52:13.910" style="s2">sacred you can&#39;t touch that one and this</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.630" end="00:52:16.790" style="s2">one is blasphemy you have to touch that</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.910" end="00:52:19.369" style="s2">one yeah so at some level I hate to say</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.790" end="00:52:21.830" style="s2">it I know I understand how it gets heard</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.369" end="00:52:24.770" style="s2">and I get in trouble for this but I I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.830" end="00:52:27.650" style="s2">gone way out of my way to make the point</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.770" end="00:52:29.390" style="s2">that these texts are full of wisdom and</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.650" end="00:52:31.130" style="s2">it is intermingled with other stuff some</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.390" end="00:52:33.380" style="s2">of the wisdom is out of date some of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.130" end="00:52:38.300" style="s2">wisdom is abhorrent and some of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.380" end="00:52:41.030" style="s2">wisdom is beautiful it is time that all</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.300" end="00:52:43.400" style="s2">of us come together we live together in</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.030" end="00:52:44.900" style="s2">a cosmopolitan civilization I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.400" end="00:52:47.360" style="s2">think there&#39;s any other honorable thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.900" end="00:52:49.910" style="s2">we can do we must come together and when</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.360" end="00:52:52.520" style="s2">we come together we can&#39;t all be asked</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.910" end="00:52:53.540" style="s2">to treat everybody as Bible as true they</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.520" end="00:52:55.670" style="s2">can&#39;t all be true because they</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.540" end="00:52:57.650" style="s2">contradict each other so if we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.670" end="00:53:00.050" style="s2">gonna do that then what we have to do is</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.650" end="00:53:01.970" style="s2">back off the claims that Oh mine mines</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.050" end="00:53:05.150" style="s2">literal yours may be metaphorical but my</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.970" end="00:53:06.800" style="s2">Bible is literal so consider it how much</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.150" end="00:53:11.180" style="s2">do you give up if you just simply</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.800" end="00:53:13.400" style="s2">recognize virgin birth is a story and it</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.180" end="00:53:17.420" style="s2">comes with a lot of wisdom some of which</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.400" end="00:53:19.640" style="s2">is incredibly important and has been</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.420" end="00:53:21.830" style="s2">widely discovered by many populations</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.640" end="00:53:23.660" style="s2">many populations have a version of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.830" end="00:53:25.160" style="s2">Golden Rule shouldn&#39;t we get to the</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.660" end="00:53:27.260" style="s2">point where we recognize each other&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:53:27.260" end="00:53:31.460" style="s2">that principle and then figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.420" end="00:53:33.770" style="s2">to instantiate it so that it actually is</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.460" end="00:53:35.180" style="s2">globalized in the way that frankly I</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.770" end="00:53:39.730" style="s2">believe the Buddhists are ahead of</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.180" end="00:53:39.730" style="s2">everybody else in truly globalizing it I</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.820" end="00:53:44.060" style="s2">cannot support any campaign that does</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.109" end="00:53:46.310" style="s2">not make the media enemy number one not</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.060" end="00:53:49.340" style="s2">left not right not the center well unit</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.310" end="00:53:51.140" style="s2">you will Unity 2020 fight the media so</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.340" end="00:53:53.540" style="s2">this is this is going down the same</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.140" end="00:53:56.920" style="s2">route that the both parties and the</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.540" end="00:53:58.690" style="s2">duopoly have gone down they start with</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.920" end="00:54:00.220" style="s2">policies that they care about issues</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.690" end="00:54:02.140" style="s2">that they care about and they start</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.220" end="00:54:03.370" style="s2">courting those interests which some will</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.140" end="00:54:04.690" style="s2">argue are not special interests but</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.370" end="00:54:07.200" style="s2">global interests but they start courting</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.690" end="00:54:10.930" style="s2">them and then those become central and</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.200" end="00:54:12.910" style="s2">then the the party whatever it is or the</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.930" end="00:54:17.260" style="s2">movement in this case changes such that</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.910" end="00:54:19.900" style="s2">that is its focus is is what is</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.260" end="00:54:23.470" style="s2">happening to the media a problem yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.900" end="00:54:26.560" style="s2">could pick three things that I would</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.470" end="00:54:28.990" style="s2">focus on before the media but the B is a</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.560" end="00:54:30.490" style="s2">problem but all of us would pick you</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.990" end="00:54:34.210" style="s2">know would have a different ordering we</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.490" end="00:54:37.300" style="s2">could probably agree many of us on the</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.210" end="00:54:39.940" style="s2">top 20 let&#39;s call it issues that are</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.300" end="00:54:41.230" style="s2">facing our country 20 we could probably</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.940" end="00:54:43.930" style="s2">probably agree on a list of 20 but</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.230" end="00:54:45.760" style="s2">ranking that list boy that&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.930" end="00:54:47.920" style="s2">tough I don&#39;t think that we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.760" end="00:54:49.120" style="s2">get agreement on a ranked list I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.920" end="00:54:50.590" style="s2">even sure you and I would agree on a</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.120" end="00:54:52.270" style="s2">ranked list No we&#39;d come we&#39;d come</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.590" end="00:54:54.910" style="s2">really close because I don&#39;t think we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.270" end="00:54:56.650" style="s2">exactly agree well so the idea that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.910" end="00:54:58.840" style="s2">got to be your issue or you&#39;re not on</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.650" end="00:55:00.400" style="s2">board that&#39;s going to be a problem that</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.840" end="00:55:03.570" style="s2">is the opposite of unity</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.400" end="00:55:09.460" style="s2">yeah I would say the other thing is</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.570" end="00:55:14.340" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to figure out how to how</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.460" end="00:55:14.340" style="s2">to come out the question it&#39;s this one</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.540" end="00:55:23.320" style="s2">there are bound to be people in all of</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.140" end="00:55:25.150" style="s2">the layers including media who are of</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.320" end="00:55:27.010" style="s2">the following three descriptions you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.150" end="00:55:29.830" style="s2">gonna have people who will serve</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.010" end="00:55:31.690" style="s2">themselves no matter what the harm is to</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.830" end="00:55:34.780" style="s2">others you&#39;re gonna have people who will</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.690" end="00:55:36.370" style="s2">do the right thing irrespective of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.780" end="00:55:39.390" style="s2">harm to self and then you&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.370" end="00:55:42.520" style="s2">a lot of people in the middle who are</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.390" end="00:55:44.110" style="s2">going to do what makes sense relative to</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.520" end="00:55:47.050" style="s2">the incentives that they find and many</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.110" end="00:55:49.660" style="s2">of those people would prefer a system</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.050" end="00:55:52.570" style="s2">that worked they would prefer to feel</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.660" end="00:55:54.040" style="s2">good about their job and they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.570" end="00:55:56.110" style="s2">the option to do it because of perverse</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.040" end="00:55:58.030" style="s2">incentives in that layer and so here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.110" end="00:56:00.160" style="s2">the question suppose you put aside your</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.030" end="00:56:02.590" style="s2">let&#39;s go after the media first position</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.160" end="00:56:04.720" style="s2">and instead you thought how do we build</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.590" end="00:56:07.060" style="s2">something that those people in the media</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.720" end="00:56:09.310" style="s2">who actually would be aligned with us if</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.060" end="00:56:10.660" style="s2">they could find that if they could find</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.310" end="00:56:12.850" style="s2">the opportunity how do</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.660" end="00:56:14.770" style="s2">create the opportunity a groundswell</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.850" end="00:56:16.510" style="s2">we&#39;ll do it right and you will still</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.770" end="00:56:18.130" style="s2">have people in the media who are really</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.510" end="00:56:19.720" style="s2">just there to serve their own interests</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.130" end="00:56:22.300" style="s2">but I don&#39;t think they&#39;re gonna be the</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.720" end="00:56:23.860" style="s2">majority so imagine that every one of</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.300" end="00:56:26.380" style="s2">the things that we might prioritize has</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.860" end="00:56:28.170" style="s2">those same three layers in it and figure</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.380" end="00:56:31.630" style="s2">out how it is that you are going to</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.170" end="00:56:33.820" style="s2">liberate those who are trapped in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.630" end="00:56:35.830" style="s2">system who would prefer something that</p>

<p begin="00:56:35.830" end="00:56:42.460" style="s2">to join us so that we can get to a place</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.040" end="00:56:43.930" style="s2">where things function again okay we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.460" end="00:56:45.580" style="s2">coming up in an hour but we&#39;ve got a lot</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.930" end="00:56:46.720" style="s2">of what look like really good questions</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.580" end="00:56:49.210" style="s2">we&#39;ll get through as many of them as</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.720" end="00:56:50.980" style="s2">possible and answer a few more at the</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.210" end="00:56:52.860" style="s2">top of the next livestream which will</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.980" end="00:56:55.510" style="s2">not incidentally we&#39;ll say this again be</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.860" end="00:56:58.660" style="s2">Saturday but will be the following</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.510" end="00:57:00.820" style="s2">Tuesday a week from today Oh someone</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.660" end="00:57:02.530" style="s2">says everything is going to be okay the</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.820" end="00:57:05.550" style="s2">Holy Spirit is here for you stay strong</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.530" end="00:57:08.680" style="s2">God&#39;s children will be victorious I</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.550" end="00:57:10.660" style="s2">think that belief is not helpful now</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.680" end="00:57:13.660" style="s2">because by putting it into someone</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.660" end="00:57:17.860" style="s2">else&#39;s hands it means that change is not</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.660" end="00:57:19.360" style="s2">likely to happen how right was JK</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.860" end="00:57:21.190" style="s2">Rowling when she wrote to call him</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.360" end="00:57:23.320" style="s2">Voldemort Harry always use the proper</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.190" end="00:57:26.950" style="s2">name for things fear of a name increases</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.320" end="00:57:28.810" style="s2">fear of the thing itself I&#39;ve always</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.950" end="00:57:33.040" style="s2">thought it was a very strong element in</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.810" end="00:57:37.770" style="s2">yeah in in those books I think the fact</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.040" end="00:57:40.450" style="s2">that Arry doesn&#39;t use the fancy spells</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.770" end="00:57:42.790" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t prefer them is a very</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.450" end="00:57:45.160" style="s2">powerful message and the fact that he is</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.790" end="00:57:46.480" style="s2">alone unafraid to speak the name of</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.160" end="00:57:48.040" style="s2">ultimart that both of those things</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.480" end="00:57:50.350" style="s2">actually suggests a kind of deep</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.040" end="00:57:54.790" style="s2">understanding of how things really go</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.350" end="00:57:57.070" style="s2">wrong speak the true name yeah yeah how</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.790" end="00:57:58.930" style="s2">can the silent majority in quotes that</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.070" end="00:58:01.210" style="s2">is not aligned with BLM anti-police</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.930" end="00:58:02.680" style="s2">defund the police agenda protect their</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.210" end="00:58:08.650" style="s2">communities from becoming criminal</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.680" end="00:58:12.280" style="s2">havens I mean so much depends on the</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.650" end="00:58:15.100" style="s2">particular context right well one thing</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.280" end="00:58:16.690" style="s2">that as people approach us and they say</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.100" end="00:58:17.770" style="s2">well okay it&#39;s happening at my</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.690" end="00:58:19.300" style="s2">institution what do I do</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.770" end="00:58:23.860" style="s2">or it&#39;s happening in my city what do I</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.300" end="00:58:24.590" style="s2">do at some level you can tell by the</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.860" end="00:58:26.660" style="s2">lack of</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.590" end="00:58:28.550" style="s2">diversity and how successful people are</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.660" end="00:58:30.770" style="s2">at fending off these things the fact</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.550" end="00:58:32.480" style="s2">that the same belief system is spreading</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.770" end="00:58:34.430" style="s2">across the landscape and then basically</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.480" end="00:58:36.200" style="s2">you can be earlier or later but that</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.430" end="00:58:37.370" style="s2">sooner or later it&#39;s gonna wash over you</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.200" end="00:58:39.710" style="s2">and people are gonna start saying the</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.370" end="00:58:41.120" style="s2">same thing about you know about white</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.710" end="00:58:43.160" style="s2">supremacy being everywhere and white</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.120" end="00:58:46.400" style="s2">fragility being the only explanation for</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.160" end="00:58:49.460" style="s2">why anybody would not agree that because</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.400" end="00:58:51.710" style="s2">that does wash over everything you can</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.460" end="00:58:53.510" style="s2">tell that the solution isn&#39;t at a lower</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.710" end="00:58:56.780" style="s2">level where how do you protect your</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.510" end="00:58:58.820" style="s2">community well what&#39;s the likelihood why</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.780" end="00:59:00.530" style="s2">nobody&#39;s successfully protecting their</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.820" end="00:59:02.570" style="s2">community or their institution that</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.530" end="00:59:04.250" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna pull it off there therefore</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.570" end="00:59:05.600" style="s2">the solution is to do it at a higher</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.250" end="00:59:08.000" style="s2">level in other words how do we address</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.600" end="00:59:11.450" style="s2">the thing that is causing people to be</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.000" end="00:59:13.100" style="s2">vulnerable to this this ideology washing</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.450" end="00:59:16.340" style="s2">over them and causing them to say a lot</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.100" end="00:59:18.020" style="s2">of untrue things so I think the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.340" end="00:59:20.210" style="s2">unfortunately there&#39;s no solution at</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.020" end="00:59:22.550" style="s2">that level join us at the higher level</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.210" end="00:59:24.760" style="s2">and let&#39;s solve the whole thing once and</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.550" end="00:59:24.760" style="s2">for all</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.970" end="00:59:29.750" style="s2">okay couple more questions</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.670" end="00:59:30.890" style="s2">according to ballotpedia filing</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.750" end="00:59:32.300" style="s2">deadlines for independent candidate</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.890" end="00:59:33.620" style="s2">ballot access have already passed in</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.300" end="00:59:36.560" style="s2">several states did your plan have a way</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.620" end="00:59:38.690" style="s2">to get around this yes regarding a</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.560" end="00:59:40.400" style="s2">spoiler why not aim to influence the VP</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.690" end="00:59:41.720" style="s2">pick for Biden get one of our candidates</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.400" end="00:59:43.370" style="s2">installed as VP it would be a</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.720" end="00:59:45.020" style="s2">substantial way to put us on the map but</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.370" end="00:59:47.720" style="s2">not risking spoiler and trump version</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.020" end="00:59:49.550" style="s2">two well first of all again why does</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.720" end="00:59:53.180" style="s2">everybody think we&#39;re risking spoiling</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.550" end="00:59:56.510" style="s2">right it&#39;s twice twice safe right that</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.180" end="00:59:58.960" style="s2">said if the Democrats want to play ball</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.510" end="01:00:01.670" style="s2">or the Republicans want to play ball and</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.960" end="01:00:03.200" style="s2">start governing right if they want to</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.670" end="01:00:04.460" style="s2">give a strong indication that they are</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.200" end="01:00:07.040" style="s2">interested in leadership and they have</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.460" end="01:00:10.040" style="s2">given up their influence peddling racket</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.040" end="01:00:12.200" style="s2">we&#39;re all ears so yes there are things</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.040" end="01:00:13.400" style="s2">down that road but boy are we gonna take</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.200" end="01:00:15.320" style="s2">some convincing that they&#39;ve actually</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.400" end="01:00:17.330" style="s2">come around because you know what the</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.320" end="01:00:18.490" style="s2">signs are quite the opposite that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.330" end="01:00:21.410" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.490" end="01:00:23.060" style="s2">well I bet shit crazy and not say catch</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.410" end="01:00:27.380" style="s2">it or bird shit or any of a wide variety</p>

<p begin="01:00:29.960" end="01:00:34.370" style="s2">on it too good question I&#39;m gonna leave</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.970" end="01:00:34.670" style="s2">it I&#39;m saving something oh this front oh</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.370" end="01:00:36.130" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.670" end="01:00:37.990" style="s2">I am okay I am</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.130" end="01:00:40.380" style="s2">but yeah if it turns out to be a deep</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.990" end="01:00:42.940" style="s2">question they can&#39;t get the typically</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.380" end="01:00:45.670" style="s2">nice bring us welcome before his name</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.940" end="01:00:48.160" style="s2">bats have kind of a PR problem I mean</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.670" end="01:00:52.540" style="s2">they just do yes especially now right</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.160" end="01:00:55.770" style="s2">and also I don&#39;t know the answer to the</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.540" end="01:00:58.240" style="s2">question but um it could be the bats fly</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.770" end="01:01:01.030" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s the roosting in caves</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.240" end="01:01:03.040" style="s2">isn&#39;t it it&#39;s yes David they are problem</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.030" end="01:01:04.990" style="s2">that&#39;s in part based on their cave &#39;no</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.040" end="01:01:07.830" style="s2">sand dart no they&#39;re not their problem</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.990" end="01:01:11.920" style="s2">is based in part on the reality that</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.830" end="01:01:14.050" style="s2">because guano of all sorts is which</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.920" end="01:01:15.610" style="s2">tends to be i think only really what we</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.050" end="01:01:17.800" style="s2">call it when it&#39;s bats somehow or guess</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.610" end="01:01:22.300" style="s2">ariel yeah when it&#39;s when it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.800" end="01:01:24.760" style="s2">shitting from this guy that pathogens</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.300" end="01:01:26.410" style="s2">are concentrated in it and they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.760" end="01:01:28.810" style="s2">become aerosolized and that&#39;s all very</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.410" end="01:01:31.210" style="s2">fine and good if you&#39;re a seabird on our</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.810" end="01:01:32.740" style="s2">rock it&#39;s gonna dissipate in the air</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.210" end="01:01:35.380" style="s2">just like being outside you&#39;re much less</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.740" end="01:01:38.620" style="s2">likely to be contracting kovat but if</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.380" end="01:01:39.910" style="s2">you&#39;re in a cave all of that is is</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.620" end="01:01:41.590" style="s2">concentrated it doesn&#39;t really have any</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.910" end="01:01:43.060" style="s2">place to leave so if you enter a cave</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.590" end="01:01:44.800" style="s2">where there are a bunch of bats roosting</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.060" end="01:01:47.380" style="s2">you&#39;re actually much more likely to get</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.800" end="01:01:50.230" style="s2">exposed to something that might actually</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.380" end="01:01:51.610" style="s2">make you act crazy then if you walk into</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.230" end="01:01:53.770" style="s2">a cave without such bats or if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.610" end="01:01:56.530" style="s2">just walking through some you know cave</p>

<p begin="01:02:46.930" end="01:02:50.950" style="s2">description of the demographic</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.400" end="01:02:54.310" style="s2">descriptors of the other people who are</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.950" end="01:02:58.510" style="s2">in this book club is is telling and is</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.310" end="01:03:00.310" style="s2">typical it does tend to be pretty much</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.510" end="01:03:03.730" style="s2">middle-class and upper-class white women</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.310" end="01:03:05.890" style="s2">who are promoting this particular book</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.730" end="01:03:08.980" style="s2">this particular screed that is so filled</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.890" end="01:03:10.570" style="s2">with hatred and ridiculous thinking and</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.980" end="01:03:12.760" style="s2">that you know why that might be as a</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.570" end="01:03:16.570" style="s2">conversation not for right now but but</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.760" end="01:03:19.750" style="s2">for another time but you know I would</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.570" end="01:03:21.640" style="s2">say at one level you know you play the</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.750" end="01:03:24.160" style="s2">idiocy of the book to your advantage in</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.640" end="01:03:25.630" style="s2">order to get them to listen to you if if</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.160" end="01:03:28.000" style="s2">you were the person of color in the room</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.630" end="01:03:30.670" style="s2">and you are listening to us and</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.000" end="01:03:32.440" style="s2">therefore at least have some suspicion</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.670" end="01:03:36.280" style="s2">that the book is not what it claims and</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.440" end="01:03:37.810" style="s2">is divisive rather than unifying if they</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.280" end="01:03:40.480" style="s2">start disagreeing with you point out</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.810" end="01:03:42.520" style="s2">that they they actually have no leg to</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.480" end="01:03:45.070" style="s2">stand on on this room because you are do</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.520" end="01:03:47.380" style="s2">you where the person who is suffering</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.070" end="01:03:50.190" style="s2">rather than rather than them yeah I just</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.380" end="01:03:53.290" style="s2">don&#39;t see anything dishonourable in</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.190" end="01:03:54.550" style="s2">playing their game on them at the point</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.290" end="01:03:56.650" style="s2">that they would insist on winning</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.550" end="01:03:58.540" style="s2">regardless of whatever else is true I</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.650" end="01:04:00.130" style="s2">might come out slightly differently but</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.540" end="01:04:02.590" style="s2">in part we don&#39;t know what you mean by</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.130" end="01:04:04.900" style="s2">POC because let&#39;s say you&#39;re Asian and</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.590" end="01:04:06.100" style="s2">we also don&#39;t know from blamed sorry but</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.900" end="01:04:08.340" style="s2">from your name I can&#39;t tell if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.100" end="01:04:10.870" style="s2">male or female and so that&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.340" end="01:04:13.240" style="s2">probably probably more effective if</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.870" end="01:04:15.070" style="s2">you&#39;re female although frankly a woman</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.240" end="01:04:16.360" style="s2">pushing back against other women is</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.070" end="01:04:17.740" style="s2">going to play very differently gonna</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.360" end="01:04:19.120" style="s2">have to use different strategies than a</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.740" end="01:04:23.940" style="s2">man pushing back against a group of</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.120" end="01:04:27.760" style="s2">women but I would say if by POC you mean</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.940" end="01:04:29.620" style="s2">that you&#39;re black then maybe it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.760" end="01:04:31.150" style="s2">marvelous opportunity now it&#39;s certainly</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.620" end="01:04:34.360" style="s2">not an opportunity without risk</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.150" end="01:04:37.660" style="s2">but imagine for example that the</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.360" end="01:04:41.950" style="s2">approach you took was I&#39;ve read the book</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.660" end="01:04:44.980" style="s2">I don&#39;t believe it and as people in the</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.950" end="01:04:48.130" style="s2">room are trying to insist that they are</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.980" end="01:04:49.540" style="s2">racist and are trying to come to grips</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.130" end="01:04:51.550" style="s2">with it and that it is the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.540" end="01:04:52.690" style="s2">problem that must be addressed and can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.550" end="01:04:54.940" style="s2">be addressed and all of the other</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.690" end="01:04:57.370" style="s2">contradictions that these people espouse</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.940" end="01:04:57.609" style="s2">you might just call them out in their</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.370" end="01:04:59.410" style="s2">own</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.609" end="01:05:01.630" style="s2">interest and they might hear you trying</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.410" end="01:05:04.180" style="s2">to liberate them from this set of</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.630" end="01:05:07.390" style="s2">circular idiocy &#39;he&#39;s right if they</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.180" end="01:05:08.499" style="s2">heard you saying you know what I hear</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.390" end="01:05:11.079" style="s2">you asserting that you&#39;re definitely</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.499" end="01:05:12.460" style="s2">racist because you&#39;re white my</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.079" end="01:05:15.519" style="s2">experience that&#39;s not how it worked I</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.460" end="01:05:17.680" style="s2">mean that&#39;s just not the nature of it so</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.519" end="01:05:22.150" style="s2">now you began with a caveat and</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.680" end="01:05:24.519" style="s2">basically unfortunately if your lineage</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.150" end="01:05:27.700" style="s2">making you a person of color is East</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.519" end="01:05:28.900" style="s2">Asian and they this doesn&#39;t show up in</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.700" end="01:05:30.999" style="s2">white fragility but it&#39;s certainly in</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.900" end="01:05:33.730" style="s2">the ideology probably what will come</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.999" end="01:05:36.069" style="s2">back at you is well Asians are a tool of</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.730" end="01:05:37.869" style="s2">white supremacy as well yeah which is a</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.069" end="01:05:39.670" style="s2">line that we ran into it evergreen and</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.869" end="01:05:41.529" style="s2">you know it&#39;s quite common it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.670" end="01:05:45.210" style="s2">absurd and ridiculous and offensive and</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.529" end="01:05:48.759" style="s2">all of these things but you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.210" end="01:05:53.529" style="s2">you&#39;re most protected against the idiot</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.759" end="01:05:55.930" style="s2">ideology the I guess the targa the skin</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.529" end="01:06:02.200" style="s2">here is the darker your skin is well</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.930" end="01:06:04.660" style="s2">case it&#39;s ridiculous you don&#39;t imagine</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.200" end="01:06:06.069" style="s2">that if you are black do not imagine</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.660" end="01:06:08.140" style="s2">that because you are black you will be</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.069" end="01:06:11.829" style="s2">safe I would say it depends on one of</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.140" end="01:06:14.470" style="s2">two things or it depends on one primary</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.829" end="01:06:16.390" style="s2">thing yeah is if the people pushing the</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.470" end="01:06:18.339" style="s2">ideology are really in the room rather</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.390" end="01:06:20.079" style="s2">than people who are a victim of this</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.339" end="01:06:21.579" style="s2">ideology that is to say they are being</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.079" end="01:06:24.609" style="s2">forced into admitting things that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.579" end="01:06:26.170" style="s2">true if the people who are leading it</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.609" end="01:06:28.749" style="s2">are there then you&#39;re in for special</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.170" end="01:06:30.940" style="s2">punishment because mm-hmm claiming that</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.749" end="01:06:33.190" style="s2">you don&#39;t see it is going to be viewed</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.940" end="01:06:35.619" style="s2">as very damning yeah but he or she has</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.190" end="01:06:37.359" style="s2">said book club so maybe maybe not yeah</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.619" end="01:06:41.609" style="s2">the chances are that you&#39;re dealing with</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.359" end="01:06:45.009" style="s2">basically people who are engaged in</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.609" end="01:06:46.690" style="s2">embracing a zombie ideology but the the</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.009" end="01:06:48.099" style="s2">people who are selling it aren&#39;t there</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.690" end="01:06:52.089" style="s2">in which case you might be able to</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.099" end="01:06:55.150" style="s2">liberate them yeah all right I think I</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.089" end="01:06:58.630" style="s2">think that&#39;s it you want to put up the</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.150" end="01:07:01.480" style="s2">end screen while we talk just so we will</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.630" end="01:07:04.029" style="s2">not be here on Saturday for logistical</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.480" end="01:07:07.690" style="s2">reasons on our end but there will be one</p>
