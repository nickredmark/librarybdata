<p begin="00:00:08.000" end="00:00:12.480" style="s2">interviews that i&#39;ve been doing in this</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.920" end="00:00:14.559" style="s2">voices of the regeneration probably one</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.480" end="00:00:16.800" style="s2">of the calls that i</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.559" end="00:00:19.039" style="s2">to some extent was most nervous about</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.800" end="00:00:20.400" style="s2">and but also feel the most honored that</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.039" end="00:00:24.480" style="s2">i get a chance to</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.400" end="00:00:26.720" style="s2">um speak to you it&#39;s it&#39;s really um</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.480" end="00:00:28.240" style="s2">a privilege to to be able to have this</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.720" end="00:00:30.400" style="s2">conversation with you so thank you so</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.240" end="00:00:34.000" style="s2">much for making time well thank you</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.400" end="00:00:37.920" style="s2">that&#39;s very uh very kind of you indeed</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.000" end="00:00:37.920" style="s2">so i i&#39;ve been um</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.239" end="00:00:42.960" style="s2">i&#39;m originally a biologist myself and um</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.120" end="00:00:44.000" style="s2">i studied biology at edinburgh</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.960" end="00:00:47.280" style="s2">university</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.000" end="00:00:49.600" style="s2">and somehow got a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.280" end="00:00:50.399" style="s2">disheartened with the reductionist focus</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.600" end="00:00:53.760" style="s2">that um</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.399" end="00:00:55.440" style="s2">behavioral biology had at the time of i</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.760" end="00:00:56.000" style="s2">studied zoology wanted to become a</p>

<p begin="00:00:56.000" end="00:00:59.680" style="s2">biologist and even in my early years</p>

<p begin="00:01:06.400" end="00:01:10.159" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.200" end="00:01:10.560" style="s2">this is the early days of sociobiology i</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.159" end="00:01:14.000" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.560" end="00:01:16.720" style="s2">basically realized that</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.000" end="00:01:18.000" style="s2">there was something about the limitation</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.720" end="00:01:20.000" style="s2">of the viewpoint of</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.000" end="00:01:23.119" style="s2">conventional research science these days</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.000" end="00:01:26.080" style="s2">that that didn&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.119" end="00:01:26.640" style="s2">fit me as a box to spend my life in but</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.080" end="00:01:30.000" style="s2">at the</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.640" end="00:01:33.759" style="s2">the same time i i&#39;ve always maintained</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.000" end="00:01:35.600" style="s2">that fascination for basically i studied</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.759" end="00:01:36.720" style="s2">biology because i wanted to understand</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.600" end="00:01:38.720" style="s2">how life works</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.720" end="00:01:40.240" style="s2">and how the process of life in geneva</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.720" end="00:01:42.799" style="s2">genevanese&#39;s works</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.240" end="00:01:43.759" style="s2">uh words creates conditions conducive to</p>

<p begin="00:01:43.759" end="00:01:47.040" style="s2">and partially got disheartened with</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.240" end="00:01:49.520" style="s2">biology</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.040" end="00:01:51.920" style="s2">because the the mystique of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.520" end="00:01:55.040" style="s2">naturalist like humboldt or darwin</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.920" end="00:01:57.520" style="s2">um was somehow taken away by</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.040" end="00:01:58.159" style="s2">the p-value of statistical significance</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.520" end="00:02:02.000" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.159" end="00:02:04.719" style="s2">um and only quantifiable data being</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.000" end="00:02:06.079" style="s2">the data that that could be part of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.719" end="00:02:08.640" style="s2">discourse</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.079" end="00:02:09.119" style="s2">um i just feel like like saying that to</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.640" end="00:02:12.879" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.119" end="00:02:15.040" style="s2">situate your self um or myself within</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.879" end="00:02:16.959" style="s2">the context of our conversation because</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.040" end="00:02:18.720" style="s2">then many years later i</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.959" end="00:02:20.239" style="s2">did a masters in holistic science and i</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.720" end="00:02:23.360" style="s2">had the great fortune of</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.239" end="00:02:26.480" style="s2">um doing like studying with</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.360" end="00:02:27.440" style="s2">professor brian goodwin who um has a</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.480" end="00:02:30.080" style="s2">very</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.440" end="00:02:31.519" style="s2">much complexity theory informed take on</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.080" end="00:02:34.640" style="s2">on evolution</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.519" end="00:02:36.879" style="s2">and um just</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.640" end="00:02:39.040" style="s2">more recently in 2016 i published this</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.879" end="00:02:39.440" style="s2">book designing regenerative cultures</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.040" end="00:02:42.160" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.440" end="00:02:42.640" style="s2">just after the publication a friend of</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.160" end="00:02:44.879" style="s2">mine</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.640" end="00:02:46.000" style="s2">put me in touch with a um young man</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.879" end="00:02:48.800" style="s2">called joe brewer</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.000" end="00:02:49.680" style="s2">who i hadn&#39;t known of before um but</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.800" end="00:02:52.400" style="s2">because my</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.680" end="00:02:53.920" style="s2">my book had the title designing</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.400" end="00:02:55.519" style="s2">regenerative cultures</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.920" end="00:02:57.360" style="s2">this friend of mine david hodgson said</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.519" end="00:03:00.480" style="s2">you need to talk to joe brewer about</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.360" end="00:03:01.200" style="s2">um culture design and that&#39;s really when</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.480" end="00:03:03.760" style="s2">i first</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.200" end="00:03:05.280" style="s2">started to to hear because he spoke very</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.760" end="00:03:06.720" style="s2">highly of you and he was working with</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.280" end="00:03:08.000" style="s2">you at the evolution institute at the</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.720" end="00:03:10.480" style="s2">time i believe</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.000" end="00:03:11.360" style="s2">and um and that&#39;s when i started looking</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.480" end="00:03:13.760" style="s2">into your work</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.360" end="00:03:15.360" style="s2">and i i feel like i need to apologize</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.760" end="00:03:15.920" style="s2">that i don&#39;t mention your work in my</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.360" end="00:03:19.040" style="s2">book i</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.920" end="00:03:21.599" style="s2">i just was aware of it afterwards</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.040" end="00:03:23.599" style="s2">um but it&#39;s very much aligned with one</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.599" end="00:03:26.799" style="s2">of the common themes in my book and</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.599" end="00:03:28.799" style="s2">like i understand that what you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.799" end="00:03:32.959" style="s2">developed over the last 30 years</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.799" end="00:03:34.879" style="s2">is a scientifically rigorous</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.959" end="00:03:35.540" style="s2">theory and argument based on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.879" end="00:03:36.799" style="s2">darwinian</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.540" end="00:03:40.080" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.799" end="00:03:44.720" style="s2">evolutionary theory that</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.080" end="00:03:47.519" style="s2">cooperation altruism and behavior</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.720" end="00:03:48.000" style="s2">in benefit of the larger hole is</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.519" end="00:03:50.799" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.000" end="00:03:52.159" style="s2">something something that um evolution</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.799" end="00:03:54.959" style="s2">selects for</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.159" end="00:03:56.720" style="s2">and that speaks to me so strongly the</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.959" end="00:04:00.400" style="s2">the whole notion that life</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.720" end="00:04:02.799" style="s2">isn&#39;t like we can see life as</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.400" end="00:04:04.799" style="s2">individuals competing with each other or</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.799" end="00:04:08.000" style="s2">species competing with each other</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.799" end="00:04:08.720" style="s2">but that&#39;s just one slice of one way of</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.000" end="00:04:11.840" style="s2">seeing</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.720" end="00:04:16.799" style="s2">this planetary process that um</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.840" end="00:04:18.880" style="s2">has over the course of 3.8 billion years</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.799" end="00:04:20.560" style="s2">made this planet more diverse more</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.880" end="00:04:24.160" style="s2">abundant more bioproductive</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.560" end="00:04:28.320" style="s2">more capable of supporting more complex</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.160" end="00:04:30.479" style="s2">and diverse life forms and um</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.320" end="00:04:31.440" style="s2">normally i start this series with with</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.479" end="00:04:33.040" style="s2">an invitation to</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.440" end="00:04:35.360" style="s2">the person to introduce themselves</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.040" end="00:04:35.919" style="s2">rather than read out the long bio so i i</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.360" end="00:04:38.720" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.919" end="00:04:39.600" style="s2">love for you to to basically tell your</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.720" end="00:04:42.800" style="s2">story a bit</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.600" end="00:04:46.080" style="s2">how did you um get into this work</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.800" end="00:04:50.080" style="s2">and how has it been</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.080" end="00:04:53.360" style="s2">in the orthodox evolutionary field</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.080" end="00:04:56.560" style="s2">to that that somehow seems to be very</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.360" end="00:04:58.560" style="s2">enamored with the the the dogma of</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.560" end="00:05:01.280" style="s2">competition drives everything</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.560" end="00:05:03.360" style="s2">um to be a voice to say no actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.280" end="00:05:05.039" style="s2">that&#39;s not quite how darwinian evolution</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.360" end="00:05:08.000" style="s2">works</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.039" end="00:05:09.680" style="s2">sure well uh yeah i&#39;ll do it in a way</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.000" end="00:05:11.840" style="s2">that i think which connects to some very</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.680" end="00:05:12.960" style="s2">general themes and goes way beyond my</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.840" end="00:05:16.320" style="s2">own personal</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.960" end="00:05:19.199" style="s2">uh trajectory i think it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.320" end="00:05:20.240" style="s2">inevitable it happens again and again</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.199" end="00:05:23.280" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.240" end="00:05:25.120" style="s2">the study of any topic when you look at</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.280" end="00:05:28.720" style="s2">it historically</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.120" end="00:05:31.759" style="s2">is that it begins with an appreciation</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.720" end="00:05:33.520" style="s2">of complexity um</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.759" end="00:05:34.880" style="s2">because everything is so complex and</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.520" end="00:05:36.000" style="s2">when you first encounter it and</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.880" end="00:05:38.960" style="s2">especially before you</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.000" end="00:05:40.320" style="s2">try to study it formally and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.960" end="00:05:42.160" style="s2">thinking about it in words you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.320" end="00:05:45.919" style="s2">describing it in words</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.160" end="00:05:48.000" style="s2">and it&#39;s easy to uh emphasize the rich</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.919" end="00:05:50.400" style="s2">tapestry of life</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.000" end="00:05:52.400" style="s2">the great complexity of economic systems</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.400" end="00:05:54.720" style="s2">of course physical systems and so on</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.400" end="00:05:58.000" style="s2">because after all</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.720" end="00:06:01.840" style="s2">they are indubitably complex</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.000" end="00:06:05.280" style="s2">but once you try to go beyond verbal</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.840" end="00:06:07.639" style="s2">descriptions and to study any topic</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.280" end="00:06:09.440" style="s2">more formally for example using</p>

<p begin="00:06:09.440" end="00:06:13.440" style="s2">then inevitably simplification is</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.560" end="00:06:15.520" style="s2">required</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.440" end="00:06:17.120" style="s2">i i&#39;m starting my career as a</p>

<p begin="00:06:19.759" end="00:06:24.560" style="s2">mathematical models knows how many</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.919" end="00:06:28.800" style="s2">simplifying assumptions you have to make</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.560" end="00:06:30.800" style="s2">just to grant through the math so</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.800" end="00:06:32.720" style="s2">this is then i think a reductionistic</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.800" end="00:06:34.960" style="s2">phase that almost all topics</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.720" end="00:06:36.319" style="s2">go through and there&#39;s great insights</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.960" end="00:06:37.759" style="s2">that come from that you build your</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.319" end="00:06:40.319" style="s2">simple models they do</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.759" end="00:06:42.639" style="s2">result in insights but then ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.319" end="00:06:44.560" style="s2">they reveal their limitations</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.639" end="00:06:45.919" style="s2">and it&#39;s at this point then you slowly</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.560" end="00:06:48.720" style="s2">begin to</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.919" end="00:06:49.680" style="s2">appreciate complexity again it builds</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.720" end="00:06:52.880" style="s2">back</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.680" end="00:06:56.240" style="s2">to the study of complexity</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.880" end="00:06:59.680" style="s2">and we really have to remember that</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.240" end="00:07:02.960" style="s2">the study of complex systems</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.680" end="00:07:05.919" style="s2">requires computational methods</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.960" end="00:07:08.240" style="s2">because analytical math is inherently</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.919" end="00:07:10.639" style="s2">limited i like to refer to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.240" end="00:07:13.039" style="s2">the the distinction between the two-body</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.639" end="00:07:15.360" style="s2">problem and the three-body problem</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.039" end="00:07:17.599" style="s2">in physics so you know the two-body</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.360" end="00:07:20.720" style="s2">problem two celestial bodies</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.599" end="00:07:22.880" style="s2">um rotating around each other in space</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.720" end="00:07:24.800" style="s2">you can predict that with mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.880" end="00:07:28.240" style="s2">equations no problem</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.800" end="00:07:29.199" style="s2">three bodies rotating around each other</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.240" end="00:07:32.080" style="s2">in space</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.199" end="00:07:33.759" style="s2">that&#39;s like enormously complex and even</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.080" end="00:07:35.680" style="s2">though you might be able to do it</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.759" end="00:07:37.360" style="s2">if you alter the initial conditions even</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.680" end="00:07:38.400" style="s2">infinitesimally then the trajectories</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.360" end="00:07:39.520" style="s2">will all be</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.400" end="00:07:42.400" style="s2">different that&#39;s what we know is</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.520" end="00:07:45.440" style="s2">sensitive dependence on initial</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.400" end="00:07:47.280" style="s2">conditions so without basically clients</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.440" end="00:07:50.160" style="s2">and computing</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.280" end="00:07:51.280" style="s2">then there was no way to go beyond</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.160" end="00:07:54.560" style="s2">analytical</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.280" end="00:07:56.400" style="s2">mathematical models and</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.560" end="00:07:58.479" style="s2">widespread computing wasn&#39;t available</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.400" end="00:07:59.520" style="s2">until the closing decades of the 20th</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.479" end="00:08:02.960" style="s2">century</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.520" end="00:08:06.720" style="s2">so we didn&#39;t even have the tools to</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.960" end="00:08:08.960" style="s2">to study scientifically study complex</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.720" end="00:08:12.720" style="s2">systems of any sort</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.960" end="00:08:16.800" style="s2">before those availability of those</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.720" end="00:08:18.960" style="s2">um of those uh tools and so that&#39;s why i</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.800" end="00:08:22.720" style="s2">think that when you encountered this and</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.960" end="00:08:24.800" style="s2">basically um became a biologist during</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.720" end="00:08:27.840" style="s2">its reductionistic phase</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.800" end="00:08:31.120" style="s2">then and you found it lacking</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.840" end="00:08:32.959" style="s2">then um that might be for some of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.120" end="00:08:36.000" style="s2">the reasons now another thing that</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.959" end="00:08:38.240" style="s2">happened in evolutionary biology</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.000" end="00:08:40.640" style="s2">was that even though darwin thought that</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.240" end="00:08:42.320" style="s2">his theory applied to all aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.640" end="00:08:45.040" style="s2">humanity in addition to</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.320" end="00:08:46.959" style="s2">the natural world the study of evolution</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.040" end="00:08:50.080" style="s2">became highly gene-centric</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.959" end="00:08:50.959" style="s2">yeah for most of the 20th century and</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.080" end="00:08:55.279" style="s2">and had</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.959" end="00:08:59.519" style="s2">nothing whatsoever to say about culture</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.279" end="00:09:02.560" style="s2">nothing whatsoever to say about</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.519" end="00:09:05.680" style="s2">culture especially or much of anything</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.560" end="00:09:09.120" style="s2">to do with humans and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.680" end="00:09:12.640" style="s2">the study of humans was ceded to other</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.120" end="00:09:16.000" style="s2">disciplines the human related</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.640" end="00:09:16.000" style="s2">disciplines which</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.480" end="00:09:20.080" style="s2">bodies but without reference to</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.399" end="00:09:23.279" style="s2">evolutionary theory</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.080" end="00:09:24.880" style="s2">very often in perceived opposition to</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.279" end="00:09:27.279" style="s2">evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.880" end="00:09:28.320" style="s2">theory and so you have this archipelago</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.279" end="00:09:32.480" style="s2">of knowledge which i</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.320" end="00:09:35.200" style="s2">frequently uh uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.480" end="00:09:37.519" style="s2">like to to reflect on many islands of</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.200" end="00:09:41.519" style="s2">thought with little communication</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.519" end="00:09:43.519" style="s2">among islands and you know the great</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.519" end="00:09:46.640" style="s2">the triumph and the magnificence of</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.519" end="00:09:49.200" style="s2">evolutionary theory is its unifying</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.640" end="00:09:51.440" style="s2">uh capacity and it has unified the</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.200" end="00:09:53.120" style="s2">biological sciences but that unification</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.440" end="00:09:54.959" style="s2">has not yet taken place</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.120" end="00:09:56.640" style="s2">for the human related sciences that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.959" end="00:09:59.120" style="s2">what&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.640" end="00:10:00.480" style="s2">progress so that&#39;s why my book is titled</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.120" end="00:10:03.600" style="s2">this view of life</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.480" end="00:10:06.880" style="s2">completing the darwinian</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.600" end="00:10:08.480" style="s2">darwinian uh a revolution so it&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.880" end="00:10:13.279" style="s2">within the</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.480" end="00:10:15.600" style="s2">the last literally within the last 30</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.279" end="00:10:17.360" style="s2">years starting in the closing decades of</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.600" end="00:10:19.680" style="s2">the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.360" end="00:10:21.360" style="s2">that evolutionists evolutionary thinkers</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.680" end="00:10:23.680" style="s2">went back to basics</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.360" end="00:10:24.640" style="s2">and they said evolution or darwinian</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.680" end="00:10:26.880" style="s2">evolution</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.640" end="00:10:27.920" style="s2">is any process that combines the three</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.880" end="00:10:30.720" style="s2">ingredients</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.920" end="00:10:32.640" style="s2">of variation selection and replication</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.720" end="00:10:35.440" style="s2">any process</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.640" end="00:10:36.079" style="s2">genetic evolution is one such process</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.440" end="00:10:38.720" style="s2">but there are</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.079" end="00:10:40.160" style="s2">others there are others in fact there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.720" end="00:10:43.200" style="s2">many</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.160" end="00:10:45.519" style="s2">of them and so this broadening out</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.200" end="00:10:46.640" style="s2">of evolutionary theory now encompassing</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.519" end="00:10:49.680" style="s2">at last</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.640" end="00:10:54.000" style="s2">darwin&#39;s vision of encompassing</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.680" end="00:10:57.440" style="s2">all things human is what&#39;s on offer</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.000" end="00:10:58.880" style="s2">uh today it&#39;s i think it&#39;s really a</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.440" end="00:11:01.600" style="s2">grand synthesis we</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.880" end="00:11:03.920" style="s2">we look back on the 20th century we say</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.600" end="00:11:06.320" style="s2">oh what a period of synthesis</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.920" end="00:11:07.519" style="s2">well that&#39;s where we are now with</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.320" end="00:11:10.079" style="s2">respect to</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.519" end="00:11:11.920" style="s2">human related knowledge and as you can</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.079" end="00:11:15.839" style="s2">see i have a great passion for</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.920" end="00:11:15.839" style="s2">for uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.240" end="00:11:22.160" style="s2">um i mean let me just like because i</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.399" end="00:11:24.640" style="s2">mentioned brian goodwin earlier</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.160" end="00:11:25.839" style="s2">brian taught me also related to the</p>

<p begin="00:11:25.839" end="00:11:30.240" style="s2">he had this slightly oversimplified</p>

<p begin="00:11:36.800" end="00:11:42.160" style="s2">then he would often say</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.560" end="00:11:42.880" style="s2">um and once you&#39;re in that realm their</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.160" end="00:11:45.120" style="s2">behavior</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.880" end="00:11:47.600" style="s2">is fundamentally unpredictable</p>

<p begin="00:11:59.680" end="00:12:03.920" style="s2">really look at it in its context</p>

<p begin="00:12:54.399" end="00:12:58.399" style="s2">fit in to this nested wholeness of</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.519" end="00:13:01.519" style="s2">life&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.399" end="00:13:04.639" style="s2">ongoing exploration of novelty um</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.519" end="00:13:06.720" style="s2">does that resonate with with your</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.639" end="00:13:08.480" style="s2">perspective or do you think that now we</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.720" end="00:13:10.800" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.480" end="00:13:12.639" style="s2">the ai to actually wrestle</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.800" end="00:13:16.079" style="s2">predictability</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.639" end="00:13:18.560" style="s2">um from life</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.079" end="00:13:20.399" style="s2">or complex systems well it does resonate</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.560" end="00:13:24.959" style="s2">but in a very complicated way</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.399" end="00:13:28.399" style="s2">and uh to get back to the three-body</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.959" end="00:13:29.519" style="s2">problem the most wonderful demonstration</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.399" end="00:13:30.959" style="s2">of that for me</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.519" end="00:13:33.040" style="s2">and it&#39;s in part an artistic</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.959" end="00:13:36.720" style="s2">demonstration is</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.040" end="00:13:38.560" style="s2">the jointed pendulum and i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.720" end="00:13:39.760" style="s2">know anything about jointed pendulums</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.560" end="00:13:40.720" style="s2">until i was just poking around the</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.760" end="00:13:43.120" style="s2">internet</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.720" end="00:13:44.959" style="s2">um but you know a pendulum that&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.120" end="00:13:46.959" style="s2">single stick that that uh that you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.959" end="00:13:49.120" style="s2">swings back and forth</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.959" end="00:13:50.880" style="s2">that&#39;s totally predictable but all you</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.120" end="00:13:52.079" style="s2">need to do is to take that very same</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.880" end="00:13:54.800" style="s2">pendulum</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.079" end="00:13:56.720" style="s2">and give it a couple of joints so now</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.800" end="00:13:59.600" style="s2">now that you know they can</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.720" end="00:14:01.519" style="s2">and then uh and then trace this</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.600" end="00:14:02.000" style="s2">trajectory like just imagine that this</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.519" end="00:14:03.920" style="s2">is going back</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.000" end="00:14:05.360" style="s2">and forth and a little pen is tracing it</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.920" end="00:14:08.399" style="s2">as trajectory</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.360" end="00:14:10.959" style="s2">it traces the most beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.399" end="00:14:12.240" style="s2">artwork as these joints you know the</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.959" end="00:14:14.079" style="s2">different arms of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.240" end="00:14:15.920" style="s2">you know are swinging around each other</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.079" end="00:14:17.680" style="s2">and stuff like that and of course every</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.920" end="00:14:18.959" style="s2">time you set it in motion it traces a</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.680" end="00:14:22.240" style="s2">different picture</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.959" end="00:14:24.560" style="s2">so just going from a single</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.240" end="00:14:25.839" style="s2">arm pendulum to a jointed pendulum with</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.560" end="00:14:28.639" style="s2">two or three arms</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.839" end="00:14:29.920" style="s2">um undergoes that transition from</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.639" end="00:14:30.959" style="s2">something that is very simple and</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.920" end="00:14:33.199" style="s2">predictable</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.959" end="00:14:34.959" style="s2">to something that is that is just</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.199" end="00:14:37.360" style="s2">infinite and it&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.959" end="00:14:39.040" style="s2">infinite it&#39;s in its variety and yet at</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.360" end="00:14:42.240" style="s2">the same time</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.040" end="00:14:43.839" style="s2">um complex systems</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.240" end="00:14:45.279" style="s2">have there&#39;s plenty of pattern and</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.839" end="00:14:47.360" style="s2">complex</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.279" end="00:14:48.639" style="s2">systems you know there&#39;s multiple basins</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.360" end="00:14:52.079" style="s2">of attraction</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.639" end="00:14:55.440" style="s2">um uh systems come to rest on</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.079" end="00:14:58.000" style="s2">on uh one of them um so</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.440" end="00:14:59.360" style="s2">we you know it demonstrates that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.000" end="00:15:02.240" style="s2">local</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.360" end="00:15:03.120" style="s2">equilibrium and here&#39;s a very important</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.240" end="00:15:07.120" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.120" end="00:15:09.839" style="s2">that living complex systems</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.120" end="00:15:11.680" style="s2">because they are sculpted by natural</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.839" end="00:15:14.720" style="s2">selection</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.680" end="00:15:17.600" style="s2">are perfectly predictable we know we</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.720" end="00:15:18.480" style="s2">we can predict i mean to a impressive</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.600" end="00:15:21.120" style="s2">degree</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.480" end="00:15:22.720" style="s2">the way animals are how they adapt and</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.120" end="00:15:25.920" style="s2">so on and so forth so</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.720" end="00:15:27.040" style="s2">uh complex systems needed to be divided</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.920" end="00:15:29.519" style="s2">into two</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.040" end="00:15:31.440" style="s2">categories one is complex systems in</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.519" end="00:15:33.839" style="s2">general of course that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.440" end="00:15:35.759" style="s2">that&#39;s the most general category then</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.839" end="00:15:37.680" style="s2">there&#39;s non-living complex systems and</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.759" end="00:15:40.800" style="s2">there&#39;s living</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.680" end="00:15:42.560" style="s2">complex systems and living complex</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.800" end="00:15:43.120" style="s2">systems because they have been sculpted</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.560" end="00:15:46.160" style="s2">by</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.120" end="00:15:49.920" style="s2">by natural selection have</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.160" end="00:15:52.000" style="s2">a great deal of of uh a predictor look</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.920" end="00:15:55.199" style="s2">at our anatomy and physiology</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.000" end="00:15:56.560" style="s2">you know uh so all kinds of credibility</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.199" end="00:15:59.040" style="s2">that there must be if</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.560" end="00:16:01.440" style="s2">if any entity is going to be well</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.040" end="00:16:04.320" style="s2">adapted to survive and reproduce</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.440" end="00:16:06.000" style="s2">in its uh in its environment and i think</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.320" end="00:16:07.440" style="s2">a lot about this because</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.000" end="00:16:09.279" style="s2">and i&#39;d be interested to know your</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.440" end="00:16:10.800" style="s2">experience you&#39;ve already kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.279" end="00:16:15.040" style="s2">alluded to this</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.800" end="00:16:18.240" style="s2">aversion to an overly mechanistic</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.040" end="00:16:19.920" style="s2">uh conception of how we can engineer</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.240" end="00:16:21.920" style="s2">things you know as if it&#39;s some great</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.920" end="00:16:24.959" style="s2">machine that we can build</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.920" end="00:16:26.240" style="s2">and run and there seems to be something</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.959" end="00:16:29.279" style="s2">wrong about that</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.240" end="00:16:32.320" style="s2">to many to many people and</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.279" end="00:16:34.560" style="s2">as an alternative they often people</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.320" end="00:16:37.040" style="s2">turn to various kinds of organic</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.560" end="00:16:40.240" style="s2">metaphors such as an ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.040" end="00:16:41.920" style="s2">or a garden and a gardening cultivating</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.240" end="00:16:47.279" style="s2">a garden</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.920" end="00:16:47.279" style="s2">is perceived to be importantly different</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.839" end="00:16:52.480" style="s2">than</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.160" end="00:16:54.160" style="s2">than um than a machine and the machine</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.480" end="00:16:55.519" style="s2">the garden metaphor is</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.160" end="00:16:57.279" style="s2">seen to be importantly different than</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.519" end="00:16:59.440" style="s2">the machine metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.279" end="00:17:01.040" style="s2">now that fascinates me because i</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.440" end="00:17:03.920" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.040" end="00:17:05.280" style="s2">i love the garden and i know how much</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.920" end="00:17:09.439" style="s2">work is required to plan</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.280" end="00:17:12.480" style="s2">and maintain a garden so much work</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.439" end="00:17:13.120" style="s2">so much weeding so much cultivation so</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.480" end="00:17:16.559" style="s2">much</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.120" end="00:17:19.600" style="s2">attention to the plants to</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.559" end="00:17:21.039" style="s2">figure out what makes them um</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.600" end="00:17:22.640" style="s2">and often there&#39;s it&#39;s filled with</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.039" end="00:17:24.319" style="s2">uncertainties if something&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.640" end="00:17:26.079" style="s2">going well in your garden well you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.319" end="00:17:27.439" style="s2">actually know exactly what it is so you</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.079" end="00:17:30.400" style="s2">have to try</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.439" end="00:17:31.120" style="s2">this and that but nevertheless the idea</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.400" end="00:17:34.240" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.120" end="00:17:36.080" style="s2">gardens don&#39;t need to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.240" end="00:17:37.280" style="s2">that the word manage is wrong for a</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.080" end="00:17:39.840" style="s2">garden</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.280" end="00:17:41.600" style="s2">i don&#39;t get that i mean there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.840" end="00:17:45.520" style="s2">intense form of management that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.600" end="00:17:46.799" style="s2">that&#39;s taken place um so and i i puzzle</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.520" end="00:17:51.440" style="s2">over that</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.799" end="00:17:53.440" style="s2">that uh so with our systems</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.440" end="00:17:56.320" style="s2">with our social systems our economic</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.440" end="00:17:59.679" style="s2">systems our interactions with nature</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.320" end="00:18:00.720" style="s2">all my heavens i mean we have to do some</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.679" end="00:18:02.880" style="s2">form of management</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.720" end="00:18:04.559" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be the gardening form it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.880" end="00:18:06.160" style="s2">actually called adaptive management</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.559" end="00:18:07.919" style="s2">that&#39;s probably a term that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.160" end="00:18:10.160" style="s2">that&#39;s familiar to you what is adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.919" end="00:18:12.840" style="s2">management basically</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.160" end="00:18:14.080" style="s2">you know you&#39;re working with a complex</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.840" end="00:18:15.840" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.080" end="00:18:17.840" style="s2">you try stuff out to the best of your</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.840" end="00:18:18.559" style="s2">knowledge and you assess to see if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.840" end="00:18:21.120" style="s2">working</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.559" end="00:18:23.200" style="s2">and if it&#39;s not you try something else</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.120" end="00:18:25.039" style="s2">that&#39;s what adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.200" end="00:18:26.320" style="s2">management is and this what we need to</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.039" end="00:18:28.799" style="s2">do so</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.320" end="00:18:30.480" style="s2">but it&#39;s a form of management so what do</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.799" end="00:18:31.840" style="s2">you think of all that well i i</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.480" end="00:18:34.960" style="s2">completely agree i think that</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.840" end="00:18:39.840" style="s2">there is a there&#39;s a nuance difference</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.960" end="00:18:39.840" style="s2">and just in in in the framing of it that</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.160" end="00:18:43.440" style="s2">i think that there&#39;s too much of a</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.520" end="00:18:46.240" style="s2">tendency that we believe that</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.440" end="00:18:47.280" style="s2">with improved science and improved</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.240" end="00:18:51.760" style="s2">technology</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.280" end="00:18:54.559" style="s2">um we can</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.760" end="00:18:55.600" style="s2">really control and and the uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.559" end="00:18:58.880" style="s2">factor</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.600" end="00:19:00.480" style="s2">is still present and so while it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.880" end="00:19:02.960" style="s2">saying that we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.480" end="00:19:03.520" style="s2">control a lot and like brian would call</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.960" end="00:19:06.880" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.520" end="00:19:09.600" style="s2">um setting the enabling constraints</p>

<p begin="00:19:09.600" end="00:19:11.760" style="s2">in the system is going to emerge in</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.960" end="00:19:13.600" style="s2">emergence</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.760" end="00:19:16.559" style="s2">has become a bit of a buzzword that is</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.600" end="00:19:19.600" style="s2">very flatly used by a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.559" end="00:19:21.600" style="s2">but because emergence can be good or bad</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.600" end="00:19:22.080" style="s2">in the system depending on what values</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.600" end="00:19:24.320" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.080" end="00:19:25.520" style="s2">you put in what you assume to be good or</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.320" end="00:19:28.880" style="s2">bad in the system</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.520" end="00:19:31.520" style="s2">um but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.880" end="00:19:32.160" style="s2">the the notion of really understanding</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.520" end="00:19:34.640" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.160" end="00:19:35.440" style="s2">that there is always something that is</p>

<p begin="00:19:35.440" end="00:19:42.480" style="s2">our knowing that um the the complexity</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.440" end="00:19:45.840" style="s2">of the nested system</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.480" end="00:19:49.600" style="s2">within which our planet sits is such</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.840" end="00:19:53.200" style="s2">that we can always be thrown a curveball</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.600" end="00:19:56.080" style="s2">and and that just sets us a um</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.200" end="00:19:57.840" style="s2">a base attitude of humility and i i</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.080" end="00:19:59.760" style="s2">quite like this notion of approp</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.840" end="00:20:01.440" style="s2">participation it doesn&#39;t mean like it it</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.760" end="00:20:02.240" style="s2">can be very much in the sense of a</p>

<p begin="00:20:02.240" end="00:20:06.080" style="s2">and setting the enabling constraints</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.159" end="00:20:08.960" style="s2">like i find it very dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.080" end="00:20:10.240" style="s2">right now in this conversation around we</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.960" end="00:20:13.919" style="s2">need to move from</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.240" end="00:20:16.880" style="s2">um ego to eco or more and more people</p>

<p begin="00:20:18.960" end="00:20:23.440" style="s2">um trying to create a picture of</p>

<p begin="00:20:23.440" end="00:20:28.559" style="s2">as places devoid of human beings and</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.640" end="00:20:30.240" style="s2">for me that would be bowing out of our</p>

<p begin="00:20:34.880" end="00:20:39.280" style="s2">we have interfered with it on every</p>

<p begin="00:20:40.480" end="00:20:47.200" style="s2">and therefore we have the role of</p>

<p begin="00:21:03.200" end="00:21:06.880" style="s2">to the best of our abilities but from</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.360" end="00:21:08.320" style="s2">this base attitude of</p>

<p begin="00:21:08.320" end="00:21:13.520" style="s2">uncontrollability because that</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.159" end="00:21:16.240" style="s2">that will just to my mind</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.520" end="00:21:17.760" style="s2">set the frame under which we then avoid</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.240" end="00:21:20.559" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.760" end="00:21:22.320" style="s2">large geoengineering processes where we</p>

<p begin="00:21:22.320" end="00:21:26.080" style="s2">like arrogantly believe that if we just</p>

<p begin="00:21:28.400" end="00:21:33.919" style="s2">cause algal blooms and that will then</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.720" end="00:21:35.840" style="s2">draw down co2 for me it&#39;s that hubris</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.919" end="00:21:37.520" style="s2">of playing with a system that is too</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.840" end="00:21:40.640" style="s2">complex to control</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.520" end="00:21:44.240" style="s2">um at that scale that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.640" end="00:21:48.960" style="s2">work against yeah so so</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.240" end="00:21:52.240" style="s2">uh i agree one of the lessons of complex</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.960" end="00:21:54.960" style="s2">systems is uh humility</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.240" end="00:21:56.880" style="s2">because because we are an immersed</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.960" end="00:21:57.440" style="s2">income we are complex systems and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.880" end="00:22:00.080" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.440" end="00:22:00.880" style="s2">who live within complex systems and by</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.080" end="00:22:04.159" style="s2">definition</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.880" end="00:22:07.280" style="s2">complex systems are</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.159" end="00:22:09.360" style="s2">filled with unforeseen uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.280" end="00:22:10.720" style="s2">consequences so we&#39;ll never have enough</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.360" end="00:22:14.080" style="s2">knowledge really</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.720" end="00:22:16.000" style="s2">to know the consequences of our actions</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.080" end="00:22:19.120" style="s2">that&#39;s why we must always be</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.000" end="00:22:20.640" style="s2">humble and we must um and we must try</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.120" end="00:22:23.840" style="s2">things out and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.640" end="00:22:24.880" style="s2">assess what works and then replicate</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.840" end="00:22:28.000" style="s2">those</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.880" end="00:22:29.840" style="s2">and that&#39;s sensitive to context so even</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.000" end="00:22:32.400" style="s2">if we figure out something that works</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.840" end="00:22:34.080" style="s2">here it doesn&#39;t won&#39;t necessarily work</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.400" end="00:22:36.240" style="s2">there without</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.080" end="00:22:38.480" style="s2">tweaking that&#39;s how that&#39;s how humble we</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.240" end="00:22:41.039" style="s2">have to be so humility</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.480" end="00:22:42.320" style="s2">is absolutely uh called for there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.039" end="00:22:45.360" style="s2">point one i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.320" end="00:22:46.880" style="s2">everyone should should um agree upon</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.360" end="00:22:48.240" style="s2">that that&#39;s revealed i think with the</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.880" end="00:22:49.840" style="s2">pandemic where</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.240" end="00:22:51.600" style="s2">where i mean some of the really bad</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.840" end="00:22:55.440" style="s2">ideas like herd immunity</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.600" end="00:22:57.039" style="s2">were the result of models and scientists</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.440" end="00:22:59.360" style="s2">i mean the models were telling them that</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.039" end="00:23:00.480" style="s2">that would be well turned out not to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.360" end="00:23:03.280" style="s2">the case</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.480" end="00:23:04.480" style="s2">so their head it&#39;s like the weather i</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.280" end="00:23:08.799" style="s2">think the weather</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.480" end="00:23:11.840" style="s2">forecasting is a great metaphor for</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.799" end="00:23:13.360" style="s2">what has to take place with all complex</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.840" end="00:23:15.280" style="s2">systems the weather is a complex</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.360" end="00:23:17.280" style="s2">physical system it&#39;s so complex that</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.280" end="00:23:17.840" style="s2">with all of the effort that we put onto</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.280" end="00:23:19.440" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.840" end="00:23:20.960" style="s2">we still can&#39;t predict the fucking</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.440" end="00:23:25.120" style="s2">weather can we yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.960" end="00:23:27.120" style="s2">not even not even a few days</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.120" end="00:23:28.320" style="s2">ahead of time and so we have an arsenal</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.120" end="00:23:32.159" style="s2">of models we have</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.320" end="00:23:34.640" style="s2">we&#39;re gathering data at an incredible</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.159" end="00:23:36.240" style="s2">refreshing rate you know the data again</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.640" end="00:23:38.480" style="s2">and again</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.240" end="00:23:41.039" style="s2">and then we test our models and and</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.480" end="00:23:44.240" style="s2">that&#39;s how how we do it well actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.039" end="00:23:47.760" style="s2">all complex systems need to be on that</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.240" end="00:23:50.000" style="s2">uh need to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.760" end="00:23:52.000" style="s2">much uh much like that but i i want to</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.000" end="00:23:55.200" style="s2">say some more about natural</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.000" end="00:23:58.559" style="s2">systems it&#39;s so very important and all</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.200" end="00:23:58.559" style="s2">of this is paradigmatic</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.960" end="00:24:02.320" style="s2">which means that um</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.520" end="00:24:07.840" style="s2">if you if you don&#39;t get it you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.000" end="00:24:08.159" style="s2">some other paradigm then you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.840" end="00:24:10.559" style="s2">going to</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.159" end="00:24:11.440" style="s2">it&#39;s going to shape your worldview and</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.559" end="00:24:12.720" style="s2">if you get it</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.440" end="00:24:14.799" style="s2">the new paradigm then is going to</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.720" end="00:24:16.480" style="s2">reshape your worldview in both cases it</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.799" end="00:24:19.360" style="s2">can be highly intuitive and</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.480" end="00:24:21.360" style="s2">common sensible but work is required to</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.360" end="00:24:25.919" style="s2">go from one paradigm to</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.360" end="00:24:29.200" style="s2">to uh another and there&#39;s a very strong</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.919" end="00:24:32.240" style="s2">tendency to uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.200" end="00:24:35.360" style="s2">think that nature left to itself</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.240" end="00:24:36.320" style="s2">strike some form of harmonious balance</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.360" end="00:24:36.960" style="s2">and that&#39;s what i mean the whole</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.320" end="00:24:38.960" style="s2">wilderness</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.960" end="00:24:40.799" style="s2">ethic that you just talked about is just</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.960" end="00:24:44.080" style="s2">you know get humans out of there</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.799" end="00:24:48.240" style="s2">and then nature will will we</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.080" end="00:24:50.080" style="s2">will revert to its its</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.240" end="00:24:52.000" style="s2">its state which is some kind of benign</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.080" end="00:24:54.240" style="s2">state that&#39;s actually a pre-darwinian</p>

<p begin="00:24:54.240" end="00:24:57.679" style="s2">notion and the christian worldview is</p>

<p begin="00:25:21.679" end="00:25:30.240" style="s2">so there&#39;s all kinds of of um</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.000" end="00:25:33.440" style="s2">single species social groups and and uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.240" end="00:25:37.200" style="s2">multi-species communities that would be</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.440" end="00:25:40.400" style="s2">just despotic in human terms</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.200" end="00:25:41.279" style="s2">the very last kind of society that we</p>

<p begin="00:25:41.279" end="00:25:47.440" style="s2">want to live in i have a number of</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.559" end="00:25:50.159" style="s2">podcasts on this with biologists</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.440" end="00:25:51.360" style="s2">including a primatologist named joan</p>

<p begin="00:25:51.360" end="00:25:54.799" style="s2">know i mean just imagine living in a</p>

<p begin="00:26:00.000" end="00:26:04.720" style="s2">dominating individuals what would it be</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.880" end="00:26:06.320" style="s2">like if so a male comes into your group</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.720" end="00:26:08.400" style="s2">kills your children</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.320" end="00:26:09.440" style="s2">and then insists that you mate with him</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.400" end="00:26:11.679" style="s2">to have</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.440" end="00:26:12.880" style="s2">his children and then some other bastard</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.679" end="00:26:15.120" style="s2">comes and kills them and</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.880" end="00:26:16.480" style="s2">you have to repeat the cycle but you</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.120" end="00:26:18.000" style="s2">have to put up with it because if you</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.480" end="00:26:19.360" style="s2">were to leave then you&#39;d be on your own</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.000" end="00:26:22.159" style="s2">and you&#39;d be certainly</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.360" end="00:26:23.279" style="s2">that would be certain death think about</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.159" end="00:26:24.720" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.279" end="00:26:26.960" style="s2">think about the most abusive</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.720" end="00:26:28.400" style="s2">relationship that you could imagine</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.960" end="00:26:30.640" style="s2">the kind of relationship where just</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.400" end="00:26:32.960" style="s2">someone comes to kill you if you</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.640" end="00:26:34.159" style="s2">leave but you have to put up with it</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.960" end="00:26:36.640" style="s2">think about that</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.159" end="00:26:38.720" style="s2">that being just the way entire species</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.640" end="00:26:40.000" style="s2">have been shaped</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.720" end="00:26:41.760" style="s2">and it&#39;s just never going to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.000" end="00:26:45.919" style="s2">different because that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.760" end="00:26:47.039" style="s2">the uh the way the selection pressures</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.919" end="00:26:50.000" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.039" end="00:26:53.840" style="s2">have just uh molded the mold of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.000" end="00:26:57.760" style="s2">species and so community ecologists</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.840" end="00:27:00.640" style="s2">in modern day use the word regime</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.760" end="00:27:02.799" style="s2">when they talk about multi-species</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.640" end="00:27:04.000" style="s2">communities they talk about biological</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.799" end="00:27:05.600" style="s2">regimes</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.000" end="00:27:07.919" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s such a great word</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.600" end="00:27:11.840" style="s2">because we have an intuition</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.919" end="00:27:14.480" style="s2">about human political regimes um</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.840" end="00:27:16.000" style="s2">a regime is somewhat stable otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.480" end="00:27:20.000" style="s2">you&#39;d never call it a regime</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.000" end="00:27:21.919" style="s2">right so the word regime conveys a</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.000" end="00:27:23.520" style="s2">degree of stability but it does not</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.919" end="00:27:25.679" style="s2">convey</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.520" end="00:27:27.600" style="s2">how good or bad that regime is a regime</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.679" end="00:27:31.840" style="s2">can be an enlightened regime</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.600" end="00:27:34.559" style="s2">it can be a despotic regime</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.840" end="00:27:35.520" style="s2">the word eugene is agnostic as a but the</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.559" end="00:27:38.399" style="s2">quality</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.520" end="00:27:39.360" style="s2">of the regime for those who those who</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.399" end="00:27:41.840" style="s2">live</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.360" end="00:27:43.840" style="s2">within it and so it turns out that</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.840" end="00:27:47.279" style="s2">natural regimes biological</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.840" end="00:27:48.640" style="s2">regimes are like human regimes they do</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.279" end="00:27:52.080" style="s2">not strike</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.640" end="00:27:56.080" style="s2">harmonious balance left to themselves</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.080" end="00:27:59.760" style="s2">uh necessarily and so the hard lesson</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.080" end="00:28:02.880" style="s2">of evolution is is that there is</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.760" end="00:28:03.919" style="s2">no functional organization without a</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.880" end="00:28:06.320" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.919" end="00:28:08.000" style="s2">of selection the reason that individuals</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.320" end="00:28:09.360" style="s2">are functionally organized that we</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.000" end="00:28:12.720" style="s2">function so well</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.360" end="00:28:15.279" style="s2">as collections of trillions of cells</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.720" end="00:28:17.120" style="s2">is because of natural operating at the</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.279" end="00:28:19.039" style="s2">individual</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.120" end="00:28:21.120" style="s2">level the reason that social insect</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.039" end="00:28:22.960" style="s2">colonies function as well as they</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.120" end="00:28:26.159" style="s2">do is because of a process of natural</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.960" end="00:28:28.320" style="s2">selection operating at the colony</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.159" end="00:28:30.320" style="s2">level if human groups function as</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.320" end="00:28:31.600" style="s2">cooperative units it&#39;s thanks only to a</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.320" end="00:28:35.360" style="s2">process of selection</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.600" end="00:28:36.480" style="s2">at that level at that level if nations</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.360" end="00:28:39.840" style="s2">function well</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.480" end="00:28:41.760" style="s2">it&#39;s only because of a process of of</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.840" end="00:28:44.320" style="s2">selection at that level and if the</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.760" end="00:28:46.399" style="s2">planet is going to function well it will</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.320" end="00:28:47.039" style="s2">only be thanks to a process of selection</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.399" end="00:28:49.679" style="s2">in this case</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.039" end="00:28:50.640" style="s2">policy selection in which we base our</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.679" end="00:28:53.919" style="s2">actions</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.640" end="00:28:56.000" style="s2">on the good of the planet the whole</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.919" end="00:28:58.000" style="s2">concept of laissez faire</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.000" end="00:28:59.360" style="s2">that basically that lower level entities</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.000" end="00:29:01.039" style="s2">can pursue their interests and that</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.360" end="00:29:04.000" style="s2">works out for the common good</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.039" end="00:29:06.960" style="s2">it&#39;s just profoundly untrue it&#39;s untrue</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.000" end="00:29:09.440" style="s2">in economics it&#39;s untrue in biology</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.960" end="00:29:12.559" style="s2">and so uh so now we&#39;re getting into the</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.440" end="00:29:16.080" style="s2">concept of multi-level selection</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.559" end="00:29:19.760" style="s2">just briefly on on that the</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.080" end="00:29:22.000" style="s2">what i understand you</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.760" end="00:29:23.360" style="s2">are saying in with multi-level selection</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.000" end="00:29:26.240" style="s2">is is that</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.360" end="00:29:27.120" style="s2">um well i mean there&#39;s the the famous um</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.240" end="00:29:30.559" style="s2">phrase that you get</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.120" end="00:29:31.600" style="s2">probably quoted at um more often than</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.559" end="00:29:35.600" style="s2">you would like to</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.600" end="00:29:38.000" style="s2">re-hear that phrase of um</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.600" end="00:29:39.360" style="s2">selfish individuals were will out</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.000" end="00:29:42.399" style="s2">compete</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.360" end="00:29:45.760" style="s2">within groups um and uh</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.399" end="00:29:48.880" style="s2">altruistic groups will out-compete</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.760" end="00:29:52.000" style="s2">selfish groups and all else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.880" end="00:29:53.919" style="s2">um what was that</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.000" end="00:29:56.640" style="s2">i can&#39;t remember the exact line and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.919" end="00:29:58.720" style="s2">mantra this is the</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.640" end="00:30:01.200" style="s2">the concluding sentence of my article</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.720" end="00:30:03.840" style="s2">with the other wilson edward ovals and</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.200" end="00:30:05.039" style="s2">selfishness beats altruism within groups</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.840" end="00:30:08.000" style="s2">altruistic groups</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.039" end="00:30:09.679" style="s2">be selfish group everything else is</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.000" end="00:30:10.480" style="s2">commentary yeah that that&#39;s the one</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.679" end="00:30:14.399" style="s2">thank you</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.480" end="00:30:17.919" style="s2">and ultimately what i understand is that</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.399" end="00:30:20.640" style="s2">um like in in my framing</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.919" end="00:30:22.000" style="s2">around regeneration working with with</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.640" end="00:30:25.279" style="s2">friends like for example</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.000" end="00:30:25.840" style="s2">bill sharp um has this framing of saying</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.279" end="00:30:28.880" style="s2">that all</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.840" end="00:30:31.840" style="s2">life exists within the tension of</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.880" end="00:30:33.120" style="s2">being for oneself and being as part of a</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.840" end="00:30:36.799" style="s2">larger whole</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.120" end="00:30:40.000" style="s2">and that speaks to to this multi-level</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.799" end="00:30:41.520" style="s2">nestedness that um on the one hand we</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.000" end="00:30:44.399" style="s2">have these</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.520" end="00:30:46.559" style="s2">individual benefits from acting in a</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.399" end="00:30:49.679" style="s2">certain way but we&#39;re also dependent</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.559" end="00:30:50.399" style="s2">on the larger group also multi-species</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.679" end="00:30:52.640" style="s2">groups</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.399" end="00:30:54.480" style="s2">maintaining the viability of the system</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.640" end="00:30:55.440" style="s2">that we are actually drawing viability</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.480" end="00:30:58.480" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.440" end="00:31:00.320" style="s2">and and what i&#39;ve understood you</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.480" end="00:31:03.519" style="s2">you&#39;re saying is that the difficulty of</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.320" end="00:31:06.159" style="s2">making these jumps in evolution to</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.519" end="00:31:07.039" style="s2">taking care of the larger system is that</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.159" end="00:31:10.640" style="s2">that actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.039" end="00:31:13.840" style="s2">is often not as</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.640" end="00:31:17.039" style="s2">advantageous for individuals or groups</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.840" end="00:31:20.080" style="s2">or nations within that next</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.039" end="00:31:24.480" style="s2">higher um level</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.080" end="00:31:27.039" style="s2">is that correct it is correct and</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.480" end="00:31:29.039" style="s2">it&#39;s often something that often is and</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.039" end="00:31:30.000" style="s2">can be stated as a form of self-interest</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.039" end="00:31:32.000" style="s2">that you can say</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.000" end="00:31:33.919" style="s2">you know in order for you to benefit you</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.000" end="00:31:36.799" style="s2">must benefit</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.919" end="00:31:38.559" style="s2">the social group that you&#39;re in or the</p>

<p begin="00:31:38.559" end="00:31:42.559" style="s2">that you&#39;re in and so the the most</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.480" end="00:31:44.399" style="s2">enlightened form of self-interest is to</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.559" end="00:31:47.039" style="s2">work on behalf</p>

<p begin="00:31:48.000" end="00:31:55.840" style="s2">um the problem with that way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.320" end="00:31:59.120" style="s2">uh is that</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.840" end="00:32:00.720" style="s2">it basically it it fails to appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.120" end="00:32:01.919" style="s2">that natural selection is based on</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.720" end="00:32:04.880" style="s2">relative</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.919" end="00:32:06.559" style="s2">uh fitness not absolute fitness it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.880" end="00:32:08.240" style="s2">a matter of like</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.559" end="00:32:11.360" style="s2">you should do a because that&#39;s better</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.240" end="00:32:13.840" style="s2">for you than if you do b</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.360" end="00:32:15.600" style="s2">that&#39;s a comparison of your fitness and</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.840" end="00:32:19.039" style="s2">under the assumption that people will be</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.600" end="00:32:21.200" style="s2">motivated to maximize their absolute</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.039" end="00:32:24.399" style="s2">fitness but evolution is always based on</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.200" end="00:32:27.760" style="s2">who&#39;s doing better than who and</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.399" end="00:32:31.120" style="s2">um it&#39;s uh it&#39;s relative and the the</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.760" end="00:32:33.440" style="s2">best example of that is cancer</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.120" end="00:32:34.960" style="s2">cancer cells proliferate at the expense</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.440" end="00:32:37.120" style="s2">of normal cells</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.960" end="00:32:39.200" style="s2">within the body the normal cells of the</p>

<p begin="00:32:39.200" end="00:32:44.159" style="s2">cells they&#39;re the ones that are acting</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.240" end="00:32:45.919" style="s2">on their enlightened self-interest you</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.159" end="00:32:47.519" style="s2">you might say participating with other</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.919" end="00:32:51.440" style="s2">cells to keep the whole</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.519" end="00:32:53.039" style="s2">organisms alive cancer cells</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.440" end="00:32:54.559" style="s2">don&#39;t do that they&#39;re they&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.039" end="00:32:56.320" style="s2">short-sighted self</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.559" end="00:32:58.480" style="s2">selfish selfish kind and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.320" end="00:33:01.039" style="s2">ultimately going to kill themselves</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.480" end="00:33:03.039" style="s2">each and every time they bring about</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.039" end="00:33:06.159" style="s2">their own</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.039" end="00:33:06.559" style="s2">demise and so but nevertheless cancer</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.159" end="00:33:08.640" style="s2">cells</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.559" end="00:33:10.159" style="s2">it&#39;s just they proliferate faster than</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.640" end="00:33:12.799" style="s2">the normal cells that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.159" end="00:33:13.840" style="s2">it that&#39;s it and so they increase in</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.799" end="00:33:15.760" style="s2">frequency</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.840" end="00:33:17.279" style="s2">every time there&#39;s a mutation that</p>

<p begin="00:33:17.279" end="00:33:20.480" style="s2">a cell to proliferate at the expense of</p>

<p begin="00:33:20.480" end="00:33:24.320" style="s2">happens and then with subsequent</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.480" end="00:33:25.600" style="s2">mutations it happens more</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.320" end="00:33:27.679" style="s2">then they learn then they evolve to</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.600" end="00:33:30.080" style="s2">disperse as metastasis that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.679" end="00:33:31.840" style="s2">natural selection taking place within</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.080" end="00:33:34.080" style="s2">the body based on a relative fitness it</p>

<p begin="00:33:34.080" end="00:33:38.799" style="s2">it has no foresight and so if you get</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.120" end="00:33:42.240" style="s2">someone if you pair</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.799" end="00:33:44.159" style="s2">the enlightened self-interest person</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.240" end="00:33:46.159" style="s2">who says oh i&#39;ll be better off we&#39;ll all</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.159" end="00:33:48.320" style="s2">be better off if we work together</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.159" end="00:33:50.559" style="s2">that&#39;s in our enlightened self-interest</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.320" end="00:33:54.399" style="s2">and then if you put in a short-sighted</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.559" end="00:33:56.559" style="s2">selfish person who exploits that</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.399" end="00:33:58.799" style="s2">well they&#39;ll win it&#39;s i mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.559" end="00:34:02.080" style="s2">relative fitness my friend</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.799" end="00:34:04.000" style="s2">and so the selfish individual</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.080" end="00:34:05.760" style="s2">even if it&#39;s not intentional will</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.000" end="00:34:08.079" style="s2">proliferate benefit at</p>

<p begin="00:34:08.079" end="00:34:12.399" style="s2">foresight</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.280" end="00:34:15.119" style="s2">there&#39;s no foresight it just happens and</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.399" end="00:34:17.359" style="s2">so if you have nations trying to</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.119" end="00:34:18.639" style="s2">grow their economy and that ends up</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.359" end="00:34:20.639" style="s2">overheating</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.639" end="00:34:21.919" style="s2">the earth and then we look at that see</p>

<p begin="00:34:21.919" end="00:34:26.240" style="s2">when when it&#39;s bad for assault well it</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.079" end="00:34:29.200" style="s2">just happens</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.240" end="00:34:31.599" style="s2">but how would you consequences and so so</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.200" end="00:34:34.240" style="s2">this is the</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.599" end="00:34:35.679" style="s2">this is to be harder in terms of in</p>

<p begin="00:34:35.679" end="00:34:38.800" style="s2">formulating our policy not just</p>

<p begin="00:35:12.079" end="00:35:16.000" style="s2">so how would you in terms of the the</p>

<p begin="00:35:16.000" end="00:35:20.720" style="s2">human predicament that we&#39;re currently</p>

<p begin="00:35:24.240" end="00:35:28.720" style="s2">or decades we still got left but</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.160" end="00:35:30.079" style="s2">and somewhere between less than a decade</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.720" end="00:35:33.359" style="s2">and maybe two or three decades</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.079" end="00:35:37.280" style="s2">to avoid um cataclysmic climate change</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.359" end="00:35:39.040" style="s2">um just hitting um runaway feedbacks</p>

<p begin="00:35:42.720" end="00:35:46.000" style="s2">thing um we&#39;d have to admit to ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.880" end="00:35:48.960" style="s2">that it&#39;s too late</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.000" end="00:35:50.400" style="s2">um i mean obviously the work that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.960" end="00:35:52.640" style="s2">done with pro social</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.400" end="00:35:53.520" style="s2">uh seems to suggest that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.640" end="00:35:56.880" style="s2">chance that</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.520" end="00:35:59.280" style="s2">that we could rearrange our activity in</p>

<p begin="00:35:59.280" end="00:36:06.400" style="s2">we incentivize pro-social behavior</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.960" end="00:36:09.839" style="s2">um that we set policies that are for</p>

<p begin="00:36:17.680" end="00:36:21.359" style="s2">like what you said earlier i just wanted</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.560" end="00:36:23.440" style="s2">to double check</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.359" end="00:36:25.119" style="s2">check that i i heard you right because</p>

<p begin="00:36:25.119" end="00:36:28.240" style="s2">in order to rematch in terms of the the</p>

<p begin="00:36:31.359" end="00:36:34.800" style="s2">rematch our activities in the way we</p>

<p begin="00:36:37.920" end="00:36:42.720" style="s2">and the biosphere we actually need to</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.560" end="00:36:43.520" style="s2">relocalize some of our patterns quite</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.720" end="00:36:46.240" style="s2">drastically</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.520" end="00:36:48.160" style="s2">um because as you also said earlier it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.240" end="00:36:49.760" style="s2">all about context so one solution that</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.160" end="00:36:50.720" style="s2">fits in one place might not fit in</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.760" end="00:36:53.200" style="s2">another place</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.720" end="00:36:54.400" style="s2">we need to match our solutions to the</p>

<p begin="00:36:58.400" end="00:37:02.079" style="s2">um that for me suggests and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.040" end="00:37:04.320" style="s2">lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.079" end="00:37:06.320" style="s2">um working on this indeed from different</p>

<p begin="00:37:09.920" end="00:37:14.320" style="s2">or the capital institute&#39;s um</p>

<p begin="00:37:50.560" end="00:37:58.079" style="s2">to my mind eleanor uh austrian&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.920" end="00:38:01.839" style="s2">work on on the commons is critical</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.079" end="00:38:05.040" style="s2">on how to enable people</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.839" end="00:38:07.359" style="s2">at a bioregional scale to wisely manage</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.040" end="00:38:09.280" style="s2">the resources within that bioregion in</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.359" end="00:38:11.119" style="s2">such a way that they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.280" end="00:38:13.200" style="s2">impinge on bioregions elsewhere and</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.119" end="00:38:14.000" style="s2">actually enable bioregions elsewhere to</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.200" end="00:38:19.200" style="s2">do the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.000" end="00:38:20.800" style="s2">is it does that resonate with your work</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.200" end="00:38:23.040" style="s2">or not sure i think what you just</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.800" end="00:38:25.040" style="s2">outlined for my regional approach</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.040" end="00:38:27.200" style="s2">is exactly what we need to be reaching</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.040" end="00:38:31.599" style="s2">for so there&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.200" end="00:38:33.599" style="s2">amiga point basically there&#39;s our um</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.599" end="00:38:35.119" style="s2">our goal it&#39;s a kind of a multi-level</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.599" end="00:38:38.240" style="s2">governance</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.119" end="00:38:39.359" style="s2">um that is uh has the global good in</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.240" end="00:38:42.560" style="s2">mind but also</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.359" end="00:38:44.960" style="s2">is uh and that&#39;s reflected in all the</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.560" end="00:38:46.560" style="s2">intermediate layers of organization the</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.960" end="00:38:50.079" style="s2">bio regions</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.560" end="00:38:52.240" style="s2">uh the cities um and all the way down to</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.079" end="00:38:54.240" style="s2">lower levels of governments especially</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.240" end="00:38:57.040" style="s2">the level of smaller groups which we</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.240" end="00:38:57.839" style="s2">will uh we&#39;ll get to buster by all means</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.040" end="00:39:00.640" style="s2">that is</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.839" end="00:39:00.960" style="s2">our target of selection you might uh you</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.640" end="00:39:04.000" style="s2">might</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.960" end="00:39:06.000" style="s2">uh you might say and so it&#39;s a matter of</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.000" end="00:39:07.200" style="s2">how we actually get there how do we</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.000" end="00:39:10.640" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.200" end="00:39:14.000" style="s2">achieve that that vision</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.640" end="00:39:16.240" style="s2">and before i comment on that i i just</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.000" end="00:39:18.320" style="s2">wanted to point out as others have i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.240" end="00:39:22.640" style="s2">no expert on this topic</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.320" end="00:39:26.560" style="s2">that uh irreversible climate change and</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.640" end="00:39:28.320" style="s2">kind of leading to a</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.560" end="00:39:29.760" style="s2">cataclysmic tipping point that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.320" end="00:39:30.880" style="s2">for humans but it&#39;s not true for the</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.760" end="00:39:32.000" style="s2">rest of life on earth</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.880" end="00:39:33.280" style="s2">oh yeah absolutely i&#39;ve heard it said</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.000" end="00:39:35.280" style="s2">that you know the earth could be six</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.280" end="00:39:36.720" style="s2">degrees celsius warmer</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.280" end="00:39:38.640" style="s2">that&#39;d be just fine for the original</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.720" end="00:39:42.720" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.640" end="00:39:46.880" style="s2">on earth just bad for us real bad for us</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.720" end="00:39:50.880" style="s2">so so i think that um we need to</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.880" end="00:39:52.560" style="s2">keep that in mind so</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.880" end="00:39:54.480" style="s2">so now back to the question is how we</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.560" end="00:39:56.400" style="s2">actually achieve this vision that you</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.480" end="00:39:57.440" style="s2">articulated very well and i really want</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.400" end="00:40:00.400" style="s2">to stress</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.440" end="00:40:02.880" style="s2">that is our goal that&#39;s exactly what we</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.400" end="00:40:05.920" style="s2">want to do but how do we go about</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.880" end="00:40:08.079" style="s2">uh doing it and</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.920" end="00:40:09.680" style="s2">austria herself wrote about this in one</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.079" end="00:40:12.720" style="s2">of the last papers that she wrote</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.680" end="00:40:14.640" style="s2">on on uh</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.720" end="00:40:15.920" style="s2">multi-level uh governance she called it</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.640" end="00:40:19.440" style="s2">polycentric</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.920" end="00:40:21.119" style="s2">uh governance and i was privileged as i</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.440" end="00:40:24.480" style="s2">think you know to work with</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.119" end="00:40:27.040" style="s2">her for three years prior to her death</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.480" end="00:40:28.000" style="s2">and what we did was we generalized her</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.040" end="00:40:32.160" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.000" end="00:40:35.280" style="s2">from a evolutionary uh perspective</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.160" end="00:40:37.119" style="s2">and we showed that that</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.280" end="00:40:39.200" style="s2">what she derived for a certain kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.119" end="00:40:43.040" style="s2">group common pool resource</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.200" end="00:40:44.400" style="s2">groups is basically applies to all</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.040" end="00:40:46.079" style="s2">groups whose members are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.400" end="00:40:47.520" style="s2">cooperate with each other you can think</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.079" end="00:40:50.560" style="s2">of cooperation</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.520" end="00:40:52.079" style="s2">as itself a common pool uh</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.560" end="00:40:54.560" style="s2">a resource so there&#39;s a set of</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.079" end="00:40:56.240" style="s2">principles that can be</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.560" end="00:40:58.400" style="s2">i mean it&#39;s really amazing when you when</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.240" end="00:41:02.000" style="s2">you think of it just</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.400" end="00:41:04.560" style="s2">think carefully absorb this i ask your</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.000" end="00:41:06.640" style="s2">listeners to absorb this there is a</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.560" end="00:41:11.119" style="s2">simple set of principles</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.640" end="00:41:14.240" style="s2">that applies to all kinds of groups</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.119" end="00:41:16.480" style="s2">no matter what they are trying to do and</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.240" end="00:41:17.760" style="s2">those same principles are scale</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.480" end="00:41:20.880" style="s2">independent</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.760" end="00:41:23.280" style="s2">they can govern relations among groups</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.880" end="00:41:24.880" style="s2">in addition to relations within groups</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.280" end="00:41:28.160" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t you want to know about those</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.880" end="00:41:31.760" style="s2">principles i would so</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.160" end="00:41:35.359" style="s2">so um that&#39;s what&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.760" end="00:41:38.640" style="s2">on offer and</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.359" end="00:41:39.440" style="s2">when i when i read those um strong group</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.640" end="00:41:41.680" style="s2">identity and</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.440" end="00:41:44.560" style="s2">understanding of purpose one fair</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.680" end="00:41:46.839" style="s2">distribution of costs and benefits two</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.560" end="00:41:48.720" style="s2">fair and inclusive decision makings</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.839" end="00:41:52.960" style="s2">three</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.720" end="00:41:55.119" style="s2">monitoring agreed upon behaviors four</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.960" end="00:41:56.960" style="s2">graduated sanctions for misbehaviors</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.119" end="00:42:00.400" style="s2">five</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.960" end="00:42:02.960" style="s2">fast and fair conflict resolution six</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.400" end="00:42:03.760" style="s2">authority to self-govern seven</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.960" end="00:42:06.160" style="s2">appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.760" end="00:42:09.280" style="s2">relationships with other groups eight</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.160" end="00:42:12.640" style="s2">it&#39;s it sounds very similar it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.280" end="00:42:13.520" style="s2">neat but you also in other works that</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.640" end="00:42:15.599" style="s2">i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.520" end="00:42:17.920" style="s2">listening to videos and you looked at</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.599" end="00:42:19.280" style="s2">eco villages and intentional communities</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.920" end="00:42:21.119" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.280" end="00:42:23.200" style="s2">we we would have a lot of places to go</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.119" end="00:42:25.119" style="s2">here but in my experience from having</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.200" end="00:42:27.280" style="s2">worked with eco villages</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.119" end="00:42:29.280" style="s2">and having worked with with the the</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.280" end="00:42:30.000" style="s2">people willing to work together and</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.280" end="00:42:32.560" style="s2">manage common</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.000" end="00:42:33.920" style="s2">pool resources it&#39;s actually not that</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.560" end="00:42:38.319" style="s2">easy to create</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.920" end="00:42:40.560" style="s2">um for example uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.319" end="00:42:42.160" style="s2">mechanisms for for fast and fair</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.560" end="00:42:45.760" style="s2">conflict resolution</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.160" end="00:42:46.480" style="s2">um so so in in the detail of how to</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.760" end="00:42:49.520" style="s2">apply these</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.480" end="00:42:52.960" style="s2">eight principles there&#39;s a lot of uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.520" end="00:42:55.520" style="s2">hard work to be done or have you</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.960" end="00:42:56.319" style="s2">seen them applied gracefully in all</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.520" end="00:43:00.480" style="s2">sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.319" end="00:43:04.960" style="s2">um contexts without bumping into</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.480" end="00:43:08.319" style="s2">human complexity yeah so there&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.960" end="00:43:12.240" style="s2">uh so much to say here uh and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.319" end="00:43:14.400" style="s2">paradoxical uh so let&#39;s spend some</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.240" end="00:43:15.599" style="s2">time on this first it&#39;s very important</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.400" end="00:43:18.400" style="s2">to remind ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.599" end="00:43:19.440" style="s2">exactly what ostrom showed for common</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.400" end="00:43:22.079" style="s2">pool</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.440" end="00:43:22.960" style="s2">resource rivers which she studied around</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.079" end="00:43:26.000" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.960" end="00:43:28.560" style="s2">what she showed was that they varied</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.000" end="00:43:30.560" style="s2">in their ability to avoid the tragedy of</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.560" end="00:43:32.240" style="s2">the commons not all of them were able to</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.560" end="00:43:35.119" style="s2">manage their common pool</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.240" end="00:43:37.599" style="s2">resources only some there was your</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.119" end="00:43:40.240" style="s2">bell-shaped curve</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.599" end="00:43:40.960" style="s2">only some were able to manage their</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.240" end="00:43:42.800" style="s2">commons</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.960" end="00:43:45.520" style="s2">most were in between and then there were</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.800" end="00:43:47.440" style="s2">the disasters on the other end of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.520" end="00:43:49.520" style="s2">bell curve so common pool resource</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.440" end="00:43:52.640" style="s2">groups that she started buried</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.520" end="00:43:55.920" style="s2">from the best of the worst the best</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.640" end="00:43:57.839" style="s2">employed these core design</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.920" end="00:43:59.760" style="s2">principles and that&#39;s what made them</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.839" end="00:44:02.560" style="s2">work so</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.760" end="00:44:03.839" style="s2">well now generalizing the core design</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.560" end="00:44:06.720" style="s2">principles means</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.839" end="00:44:07.359" style="s2">that when we examine any other kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.720" end="00:44:11.200" style="s2">groups</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.359" end="00:44:15.520" style="s2">schools businesses neighborhoods</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.200" end="00:44:19.040" style="s2">families nonprofits any</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.520" end="00:44:22.560" style="s2">cooperative endeavor you&#39;ll find</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.040" end="00:44:24.000" style="s2">your bell-shaped curve some will work</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.560" end="00:44:25.520" style="s2">spectacularly well</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.000" end="00:44:27.359" style="s2">most will be in the middle and then</p>

<p begin="00:44:38.480" end="00:44:45.280" style="s2">on on this to basically back up that</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.119" end="00:44:46.880" style="s2">back up that claim as it turns out the</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.280" end="00:44:49.599" style="s2">research that we&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.880" end="00:44:52.240" style="s2">on intentional communities shows it as a</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.599" end="00:44:54.960" style="s2">group they perform pretty well</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.240" end="00:44:55.760" style="s2">uh you know the bell shape is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.960" end="00:44:57.839" style="s2">shifted</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.760" end="00:44:59.440" style="s2">in the good direction for that</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.839" end="00:45:01.839" style="s2">particular kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.440" end="00:45:03.040" style="s2">uh for that particular kind of group but</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.839" end="00:45:07.040" style="s2">even so</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.040" end="00:45:09.359" style="s2">all kind of of a variation so it is not</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.040" end="00:45:10.800" style="s2">the case that groups just all groups</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.359" end="00:45:12.720" style="s2">just spontaneously</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.800" end="00:45:13.920" style="s2">uh implement the core design principles</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.720" end="00:45:15.599" style="s2">not at all</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.920" end="00:45:17.440" style="s2">that&#39;s why work is required but actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.599" end="00:45:21.200" style="s2">that&#39;s your first task</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.440" end="00:45:21.920" style="s2">your first task is to work at the scale</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.200" end="00:45:25.119" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.920" end="00:45:27.920" style="s2">of small functionally</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.119" end="00:45:28.640" style="s2">oriented groups and i&#39;ll say more about</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.920" end="00:45:31.760" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.640" end="00:45:33.440" style="s2">in a minute and then of course we need</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.760" end="00:45:35.520" style="s2">to work at still larger skills</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.440" end="00:45:37.200" style="s2">but if the if the small groups aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.520" end="00:45:38.000" style="s2">working well then larger society is not</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.200" end="00:45:41.280" style="s2">going to work well</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.000" end="00:45:42.000" style="s2">that&#39;s for sure so one one project and</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.280" end="00:45:44.839" style="s2">it&#39;s quite a</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.000" end="00:45:47.760" style="s2">doable project this is something that</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.839" end="00:45:51.200" style="s2">anybody who&#39;s listening to this</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.760" end="00:45:53.920" style="s2">can do if they&#39;re already</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.200" end="00:45:55.440" style="s2">in groups that are meaningful to them</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.920" end="00:45:57.200" style="s2">then they can learn about this approach</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.440" end="00:46:00.319" style="s2">and they can make their groups function</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.200" end="00:46:04.960" style="s2">better if they&#39;re not in a group</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.319" end="00:46:07.200" style="s2">well find one or to make one</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.960" end="00:46:08.319" style="s2">work in groups and i&#39;ll say more about</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.200" end="00:46:09.920" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.319" end="00:46:12.319" style="s2">in a minute so there&#39;s something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.920" end="00:46:14.000" style="s2">just that&#39;s an incredibly important</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.319" end="00:46:17.359" style="s2">insight to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.000" end="00:46:19.040" style="s2">to make about about working at the level</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.359" end="00:46:20.400" style="s2">of small groups which everyone can do</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.040" end="00:46:22.560" style="s2">and then of course those groups have to</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.400" end="00:46:24.319" style="s2">be coordinated that&#39;s when we go up in</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.560" end="00:46:28.560" style="s2">the scale</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.319" end="00:46:31.760" style="s2">i the the</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.560" end="00:46:34.480" style="s2">the suspicion i have</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.760" end="00:46:35.760" style="s2">that in that data set that ostrom</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.480" end="00:46:38.560" style="s2">studied</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.760" end="00:46:42.000" style="s2">one of the common patterns for the ones</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.560" end="00:46:43.359" style="s2">that were the ones that failed</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.000" end="00:46:45.359" style="s2">because not all of these eight</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.359" end="00:46:47.200" style="s2">principles the authority to self-govern</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.359" end="00:46:49.280" style="s2">is one of those slightly</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.200" end="00:46:51.040" style="s2">slippery ones because that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.280" end="00:46:54.240" style="s2">entirely within the</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.040" end="00:46:57.200" style="s2">um jurisdiction of the group itself and</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.240" end="00:46:59.440" style="s2">and very often what i think is the most</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.200" end="00:47:00.960" style="s2">destructive factor of a group of people</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.440" end="00:47:03.680" style="s2">trying to manage a common pool</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.960" end="00:47:05.680" style="s2">resource is if they&#39;re embedded in a</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.680" end="00:47:07.440" style="s2">system that is actually stacked against</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.680" end="00:47:08.400" style="s2">them and and i find this over and over</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.440" end="00:47:10.000" style="s2">now when</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.400" end="00:47:11.760" style="s2">when i have conversations with people</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.000" end="00:47:14.319" style="s2">around could we cr</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.760" end="00:47:15.839" style="s2">could i turn my company over to being a</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.319" end="00:47:18.000" style="s2">regenerative company</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.839" end="00:47:18.880" style="s2">and if we&#39;re if we&#39;re still in the zero</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.000" end="00:47:21.200" style="s2">sum um</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.880" end="00:47:22.800" style="s2">competitive environment of the current</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.200" end="00:47:25.359" style="s2">economic playing field</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.800" end="00:47:26.240" style="s2">it is very difficult for companies to</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.359" end="00:47:28.480" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.240" end="00:47:30.079" style="s2">become regenerative because the the</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.480" end="00:47:30.480" style="s2">playing field is stacked against them</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.079" end="00:47:33.599" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.480" end="00:47:36.839" style="s2">my sense is that some of the the</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.599" end="00:47:38.240" style="s2">these common pool resource management</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.839" end="00:47:41.760" style="s2">attempts</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.240" end="00:47:44.640" style="s2">failed because of that they&#39;re nested in</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.760" end="00:47:53.839" style="s2">within a larger system that also</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.640" end="00:47:53.839" style="s2">influenced their success and failure</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.480" end="00:47:58.480" style="s2">the core design principles are a little</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.480" end="00:48:02.000" style="s2">bit like the organs of your body</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.480" end="00:48:04.640" style="s2">um everyone is native</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.000" end="00:48:06.000" style="s2">you move a single one and you die so and</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.640" end="00:48:09.520" style="s2">it&#39;s not quite that bad but</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.000" end="00:48:12.800" style="s2">but um but there is a sense in which um</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.520" end="00:48:15.359" style="s2">a group can fail for um</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.800" end="00:48:16.640" style="s2">for lack of uh any one of the cortisone</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.359" end="00:48:17.440" style="s2">principles and the one that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.640" end="00:48:20.640" style="s2">pointed out</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.440" end="00:48:22.079" style="s2">local autonomy the groups just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.640" end="00:48:24.640" style="s2">have the elbow room</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.079" end="00:48:26.079" style="s2">or they&#39;re operating in a in a larger</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.640" end="00:48:28.960" style="s2">environment that&#39;s stacked against them</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.079" end="00:48:30.880" style="s2">that is indeed huge make no mistake</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.960" end="00:48:32.480" style="s2">and you and i have both done a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.880" end="00:48:34.240" style="s2">reading um</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.480" end="00:48:36.160" style="s2">about that lately i&#39;ve been rating about</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.240" end="00:48:37.119" style="s2">platform cooperatives which i&#39;ll bet you</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.160" end="00:48:39.200" style="s2">know about</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.119" end="00:48:40.480" style="s2">as well the idea that basically you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.200" end="00:48:43.599" style="s2">things like airbnb</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.480" end="00:48:45.119" style="s2">and uber and and lyft the gig economy</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.599" end="00:48:49.440" style="s2">you know that those could actually work</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.119" end="00:48:51.359" style="s2">pretty well if they weren&#39;t so</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.440" end="00:48:53.359" style="s2">exploitative you know if they weren&#39;t so</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.359" end="00:48:56.319" style="s2">locked into the capitalist</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.359" end="00:48:58.079" style="s2">model and come to try to create a a</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.319" end="00:48:59.520" style="s2">cooperative platform and you realize</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.079" end="00:49:01.440" style="s2">that there&#39;s all kind of legislation</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.520" end="00:49:04.480" style="s2">that stacked</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.440" end="00:49:07.680" style="s2">against it that makes it hard not not</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.480" end="00:49:09.680" style="s2">easy and whenever i talk to people</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.680" end="00:49:11.359" style="s2">all the time about this sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.680" end="00:49:12.720" style="s2">and they talk about their institutional</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.359" end="00:49:15.599" style="s2">environment</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.720" end="00:49:16.160" style="s2">mostly as the institutional environment</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.599" end="00:49:19.520" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.160" end="00:49:21.599" style="s2">is a problem is is is basically</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.520" end="00:49:23.040" style="s2">holding them back that was my own</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.599" end="00:49:24.720" style="s2">experience when i tried to</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.040" end="00:49:27.680" style="s2">the first project that i tried to start</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.720" end="00:49:30.559" style="s2">in my uh my</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.680" end="00:49:32.160" style="s2">hometown of hometown of binghamton</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.559" end="00:49:35.520" style="s2">nevertheless</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.160" end="00:49:37.040" style="s2">there&#39;s many internal uh problems</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.520" end="00:49:39.520" style="s2">how in how many groups is there an</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.040" end="00:49:39.520" style="s2">unequal</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.000" end="00:49:43.440" style="s2">allocation of costs and benefits in</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.839" end="00:49:44.960" style="s2">other words some people do most of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.440" end="00:49:45.520" style="s2">work some members of the group do most</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.960" end="00:49:47.520" style="s2">of the work</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.520" end="00:49:49.599" style="s2">other members get the benefit and how</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.520" end="00:49:52.079" style="s2">many groups especially in businesses</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.599" end="00:49:53.920" style="s2">is decision making not fair and</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.079" end="00:49:55.200" style="s2">equitable some people in within the</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.920" end="00:49:59.040" style="s2">group don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.200" end="00:50:02.240" style="s2">uh aren&#39;t part of the decision-making</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.040" end="00:50:03.119" style="s2">uh uh process and how many groups is it</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.240" end="00:50:04.640" style="s2">the case that</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.119" end="00:50:07.440" style="s2">basically there&#39;s no monitoring of</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.640" end="00:50:10.160" style="s2">agreed-upon behavior goes on and on</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.440" end="00:50:11.119" style="s2">so so uh every group needs to do an</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.160" end="00:50:12.720" style="s2">assessment</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.119" end="00:50:14.480" style="s2">and then they need to improve the things</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.720" end="00:50:15.359" style="s2">that they&#39;re in a position to improve</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.480" end="00:50:17.280" style="s2">upon</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.359" end="00:50:18.400" style="s2">and if there&#39;s things that they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.280" end="00:50:20.400" style="s2">control</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.400" end="00:50:21.599" style="s2">then those are obstacles that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.400" end="00:50:25.680" style="s2">move around</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.599" end="00:50:28.400" style="s2">and that actually introduces another</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.680" end="00:50:30.160" style="s2">element of pro-social which is just as</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.400" end="00:50:32.800" style="s2">important as the core</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.160" end="00:50:33.520" style="s2">design principles which is the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.800" end="00:50:37.359" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.520" end="00:50:39.680" style="s2">adaptable flexible and</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.359" end="00:50:41.839" style="s2">evolvable so just because you have an</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.680" end="00:50:44.319" style="s2">aspiration</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.839" end="00:50:45.040" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean you can achieve it i like</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.319" end="00:50:46.640" style="s2">to say that</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.040" end="00:50:48.240" style="s2">every year we make our new year&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.640" end="00:50:49.200" style="s2">resolutions and every year we fail to</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.240" end="00:50:52.000" style="s2">keep them</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.200" end="00:50:53.520" style="s2">so so and the same is true for groups a</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.000" end="00:50:55.200" style="s2">group could decide to</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.520" end="00:50:57.680" style="s2">implement the core design principles</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.200" end="00:50:59.200" style="s2">better that doesn&#39;t mean that they can</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.680" end="00:51:01.520" style="s2">do it anymore that we can achieve our</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.200" end="00:51:03.839" style="s2">new year&#39;s resolutions and so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.520" end="00:51:08.000" style="s2">whole process that&#39;s required</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.839" end="00:51:11.359" style="s2">in order to become unstuck unstuck</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.000" end="00:51:13.599" style="s2">and to move towards our valued</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.359" end="00:51:14.720" style="s2">goals and here this and these these</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.599" end="00:51:18.480" style="s2">techniques come from</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.720" end="00:51:20.800" style="s2">like therapy mindfulness based</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.480" end="00:51:22.240" style="s2">therapy which turns out to be highly</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.800" end="00:51:24.800" style="s2">evidence-based i mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.240" end="00:51:26.079" style="s2">techniques that work that can make you</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.800" end="00:51:28.720" style="s2">more flexible</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.079" end="00:51:30.640" style="s2">as an individual and as an organization</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.720" end="00:51:32.319" style="s2">these are teachable skills</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.640" end="00:51:33.680" style="s2">and that&#39;s great to know and this is</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.319" end="00:51:37.000" style="s2">what what you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.680" end="00:51:40.240" style="s2">setting up with the pro social platform</p>

<p begin="00:51:49.040" end="00:51:53.119" style="s2">create and i invite</p>

<p begin="00:51:53.119" end="00:51:57.359" style="s2">uh uh check it out basically we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.359" end="00:52:00.079" style="s2">trying to create the architecture</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.359" end="00:52:00.559" style="s2">for working at all scales starting with</p>

<p begin="00:52:00.559" end="00:52:06.720" style="s2">to make them more flexible and to</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.319" end="00:52:07.839" style="s2">uh in evolutionary terms to accomplish a</p>

<p begin="00:52:07.839" end="00:52:15.440" style="s2">transition so that</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.119" end="00:52:18.559" style="s2">these internal uh divisive interactions</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.440" end="00:52:20.640" style="s2">disruptive interactions the group</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.559" end="00:52:22.319" style="s2">becomes protected against them</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.640" end="00:52:24.400" style="s2">and that they could operate as an</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.319" end="00:52:27.200" style="s2">organism basically as a group level</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.400" end="00:52:27.760" style="s2">as a group level of organism i mean i i</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.200" end="00:52:30.839" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.760" end="00:52:33.680" style="s2">talking to you that there is such an</p>

<p begin="00:52:33.680" end="00:52:36.880" style="s2">and this impulse of working</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.520" end="00:52:38.960" style="s2">regeneratively because</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.880" end="00:52:41.599" style="s2">regeneratively might be a bit obscure as</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.960" end="00:52:43.520" style="s2">a word but it is basically working from</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.599" end="00:52:44.240" style="s2">a developmental and evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.520" end="00:52:47.280" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.240" end="00:52:48.640" style="s2">understanding that the idea that there</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.280" end="00:52:50.960" style="s2">is some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.640" end="00:52:51.920" style="s2">regenerative culture or sustainable</p>

<p begin="00:52:51.920" end="00:52:56.000" style="s2">sustainable human settlement that that</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.760" end="00:52:56.880" style="s2">we can just design on a drawing board</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.000" end="00:52:59.119" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.880" end="00:53:00.559" style="s2">implement everywhere the same kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.119" end="00:53:03.040" style="s2">pattern</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.559" end="00:53:03.599" style="s2">and once we arrived there we can happily</p>

<p begin="00:53:03.599" end="00:53:06.720" style="s2">ever after is of course completely</p>

<p begin="00:53:06.720" end="00:53:10.319" style="s2">and and the the idea of working</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.640" end="00:53:13.520" style="s2">regeneratively is working</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.319" end="00:53:16.880" style="s2">with people in place to um</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.520" end="00:53:20.800" style="s2">build the capacity of these people to</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.880" end="00:53:24.400" style="s2">both individually and as a group</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.800" end="00:53:26.640" style="s2">contribute the uniqueness of</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.400" end="00:53:28.559" style="s2">what each individual or the group</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.640" end="00:53:31.200" style="s2">carries as a unique essence and</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.559" end="00:53:33.839" style="s2">contribution to the evolutionary process</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.200" end="00:53:36.079" style="s2">and to be able to express that within</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.839" end="00:53:38.160" style="s2">the context of the larger hole that they</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.079" end="00:53:39.920" style="s2">they&#39;re sitting in and and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.160" end="00:53:43.599" style="s2">literally building</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.920" end="00:53:47.119" style="s2">the flexibility and adaptability into</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.599" end="00:53:50.400" style="s2">the the groups the social system</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.119" end="00:53:52.720" style="s2">that we can continue to evolve and adapt</p>

<p begin="00:53:52.720" end="00:53:57.839" style="s2">but we do so</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.760" end="00:53:57.839" style="s2">with the understanding that</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.920" end="00:54:03.040" style="s2">at every level the maximum potential can</p>

<p begin="00:54:10.319" end="00:54:13.839" style="s2">in my language from my academic like my</p>

<p begin="00:54:15.200" end="00:54:22.240" style="s2">and i borrowed aaron antonovsky&#39;s um</p>

<p begin="00:54:24.960" end="00:54:27.839" style="s2">design and that that marries very well</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.880" end="00:54:31.520" style="s2">with with</p>

<p begin="00:54:47.920" end="00:54:52.000" style="s2">and i&#39;d love you to say a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.160" end="00:54:53.359" style="s2">more about these processes like if if</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.000" end="00:54:55.680" style="s2">people are listening and saying i want</p>

<p begin="00:55:16.319" end="00:55:22.640" style="s2">so happy that you raised this set of</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.440" end="00:55:23.839" style="s2">a set of issues and there is alignment a</p>

<p begin="00:55:23.839" end="00:55:28.240" style="s2">of um alignment so much that</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.880" end="00:55:30.000" style="s2">we have to ask the question you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.240" end="00:55:31.920" style="s2">what&#39;s the added value</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.000" end="00:55:34.480" style="s2">that if you&#39;re in this particular</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.920" end="00:55:35.440" style="s2">movement have more or less converged</p>

<p begin="00:55:44.480" end="00:55:49.760" style="s2">you know i&#39;ve just reinvented the wheel</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.400" end="00:55:51.920" style="s2">talking about the same stuff and in in</p>

<p begin="00:55:55.280" end="00:56:00.319" style="s2">not the case and i&#39;ll now explain</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.119" end="00:56:01.520" style="s2">why that is there&#39;s so many convergences</p>

<p begin="00:56:51.760" end="00:56:55.920" style="s2">developed magnificent procedures</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.000" end="00:56:57.359" style="s2">basically continuing improvement</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.920" end="00:56:59.920" style="s2">procedures variation</p>

<p begin="00:57:06.000" end="00:57:09.920" style="s2">uh trying to do if they could turn that</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.920" end="00:57:13.839" style="s2">genius to the global good</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.920" end="00:57:13.839" style="s2">then that would be just you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.960" end="00:57:24.799" style="s2">if you look at any one of these</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.400" end="00:57:28.119" style="s2">and you ask what is its narrative</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.799" end="00:57:31.280" style="s2">what is its religion what is its</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.119" end="00:57:34.160" style="s2">justification how does it explain itself</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.280" end="00:57:35.839" style="s2">what is its rationale how does it</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.160" end="00:57:38.880" style="s2">replicate</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.839" end="00:57:40.160" style="s2">um what you find is is that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.880" end="00:57:44.319" style="s2">lot of</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.160" end="00:57:46.480" style="s2">localism in that these tend to arise in</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.319" end="00:57:50.079" style="s2">a particular time</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.480" end="00:57:52.400" style="s2">and place and they&#39;re described with a</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.079" end="00:57:55.119" style="s2">certain vocabulary</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.400" end="00:57:57.040" style="s2">they spread to a degree uh based on</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.119" end="00:57:59.839" style="s2">their</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.040" end="00:58:01.839" style="s2">success but then they come up against</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.839" end="00:58:03.359" style="s2">limits beyond which they are truly</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.839" end="00:58:05.040" style="s2">unknown</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.359" end="00:58:06.960" style="s2">truly unknown no one&#39;s ever heard of</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.040" end="00:58:09.119" style="s2">them so you know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.960" end="00:58:10.400" style="s2">famous and well known within their</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.119" end="00:58:14.000" style="s2">sphere</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.400" end="00:58:16.000" style="s2">but then they come up against limits</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.000" end="00:58:17.359" style="s2">and did i say that decades was required</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.000" end="00:58:18.480" style="s2">for them to spread to the limits that</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.359" end="00:58:22.559" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.480" end="00:58:25.920" style="s2">did the degree that they that they uh</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.559" end="00:58:27.520" style="s2">that they do and this is so much this is</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.920" end="00:58:29.200" style="s2">why i&#39;m so happy</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.520" end="00:58:31.200" style="s2">you know that you are too to actually</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.200" end="00:58:32.640" style="s2">have a biological</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.200" end="00:58:35.520" style="s2">background because isn&#39;t that the way</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.640" end="00:58:37.200" style="s2">species are species originate in a</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.520" end="00:58:38.720" style="s2">certain time and place they spread on</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.200" end="00:58:39.760" style="s2">the basis of their success and then they</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.720" end="00:58:44.960" style="s2">come up against them</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.760" end="00:58:44.960" style="s2">it&#39;s their geographical geographical</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.680" end="00:58:51.119" style="s2">distribution and so what&#39;s needed to go</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.200" end="00:58:55.040" style="s2">beyond this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.119" end="00:58:55.040" style="s2">uh limited</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.000" end="00:59:02.160" style="s2">success is to be able to formulate</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.200" end="00:59:03.280" style="s2">it in more general terms so that they so</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.160" end="00:59:05.440" style="s2">that we could really see</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.280" end="00:59:06.640" style="s2">what are the principles that can be</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.440" end="00:59:10.480" style="s2">applied to</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.640" end="00:59:13.680" style="s2">any through any context any</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.480" end="00:59:16.720" style="s2">scale that general level of description</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.680" end="00:59:18.079" style="s2">based basically on on foundational</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.720" end="00:59:19.839" style="s2">theory and you can&#39;t get more</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.079" end="00:59:21.440" style="s2">foundational than complex systems theory</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.839" end="00:59:23.680" style="s2">and evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.440" end="00:59:25.280" style="s2">theory when you state it that way and if</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.680" end="00:59:29.680" style="s2">you actually bring in to bear</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.280" end="00:59:32.880" style="s2">state-of-the-art assessment and and</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.680" end="00:59:34.319" style="s2">and and things like that then</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.880" end="00:59:36.480" style="s2">uh then you&#39;ve got something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.319" end="00:59:39.200" style="s2">capable of spreading worldwide</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.480" end="00:59:40.640" style="s2">and fast and basically providing a</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.200" end="00:59:43.359" style="s2">common language</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.640" end="00:59:44.799" style="s2">that all of these different uh</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.359" end="00:59:47.440" style="s2">traditions</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.799" end="00:59:49.359" style="s2">that have indeed happened upon the same</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.440" end="00:59:50.960" style="s2">thing and have all kind of wisdom based</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.359" end="00:59:54.799" style="s2">on experience</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.960" end="00:59:59.119" style="s2">that um to to draw upon</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.799" end="01:00:01.119" style="s2">can can actually merge and combine</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.119" end="01:00:03.040" style="s2">in a way that was not taking place</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.119" end="01:00:05.040" style="s2">before you basically you transcended</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.040" end="01:00:07.520" style="s2">this archipelago</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.040" end="01:00:08.319" style="s2">structure of knowledge and knowledge and</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.520" end="01:00:10.960" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.319" end="01:00:11.920" style="s2">and practice so that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.960" end="01:00:15.119" style="s2">and uh</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.920" end="01:00:16.240" style="s2">and it&#39;s so exciting to see it happening</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.119" end="01:00:19.200" style="s2">in a collaborative</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.240" end="01:00:20.160" style="s2">uh collaborative and not a competitive</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.200" end="01:00:23.760" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.160" end="01:00:23.760" style="s2">spirit that um</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.079" end="01:00:28.160" style="s2">and then i&#39;d want to spread that still</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.799" end="01:00:31.200" style="s2">further</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.160" end="01:00:34.480" style="s2">in in your area basically</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.200" end="01:00:35.760" style="s2">of regenerative design would be we will</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.480" end="01:00:39.119" style="s2">learn from you</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.760" end="01:00:42.480" style="s2">and uh and we can uh</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.119" end="01:00:43.440" style="s2">add value in terms of the practices what</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.480" end="01:00:45.200" style="s2">we&#39;re what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.440" end="01:00:47.920" style="s2">what we&#39;re attempting to uh what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.200" end="01:00:50.960" style="s2">attempting to do</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.920" end="01:00:52.559" style="s2">absolutely i mean i came across just</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.960" end="01:00:54.400" style="s2">doing the research for our</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.559" end="01:00:56.640" style="s2">conversation i came across this report</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.400" end="01:00:59.680" style="s2">that the revolution institute did for</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.640" end="01:01:02.079" style="s2">the b corporations in 2016 i think it</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.680" end="01:01:03.839" style="s2">was entitled doing well by doing good</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.079" end="01:01:05.119" style="s2">and in it you summarize these these</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.839" end="01:01:07.440" style="s2">three very basic</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.119" end="01:01:07.440" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.520" end="01:01:13.839" style="s2">kind of behavioral rules for effective</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.880" end="01:01:15.760" style="s2">groups</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.839" end="01:01:18.000" style="s2">i think it was group members must</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.760" end="01:01:20.720" style="s2">appropriate coordinate their actions</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.000" end="01:01:22.319" style="s2">they must avoid disruptive self-serving</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.720" end="01:01:24.319" style="s2">behaviors within the group</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.319" end="01:01:26.400" style="s2">and they must cultivate appropriate</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.319" end="01:01:29.599" style="s2">relationship with other groups</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.400" end="01:01:31.119" style="s2">and and that again speaks to to this</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.599" end="01:01:35.599" style="s2">nested</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.119" end="01:01:39.119" style="s2">architecture of group community</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.599" end="01:01:41.040" style="s2">bioregion i personally think that we we</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.119" end="01:01:43.440" style="s2">might have</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.040" end="01:01:45.359" style="s2">gone down a sort of maladaptive detour</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.440" end="01:01:49.520" style="s2">by adding in</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.359" end="01:01:51.280" style="s2">superfluous um sociopolitical layer</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.520" end="01:01:53.040" style="s2">called the nation state and i i</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.280" end="01:01:56.079" style="s2">personally feel that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.040" end="01:01:57.200" style="s2">an anachronism that that we probably</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.079" end="01:02:00.960" style="s2">will</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.200" end="01:02:04.079" style="s2">do without in in 200 years time and</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.960" end="01:02:04.960" style="s2">we i think we need a global governance</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.079" end="01:02:08.480" style="s2">system that</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.960" end="01:02:09.599" style="s2">enables subsidiarity down to by regions</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.480" end="01:02:12.960" style="s2">and communities</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.599" end="01:02:14.720" style="s2">um as as as the structure um</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.960" end="01:02:16.400" style="s2">but i&#39;m glad you used the word i&#39;m glad</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.720" end="01:02:20.079" style="s2">you used the word subsidiarity</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.400" end="01:02:22.559" style="s2">which is a catholic concept uh</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.079" end="01:02:23.760" style="s2">and uh federalism is another which is</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.559" end="01:02:27.119" style="s2">nested</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.760" end="01:02:28.559" style="s2">and and i think that um it&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.119" end="01:02:30.640" style="s2">cultural evolution that it</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.559" end="01:02:32.160" style="s2">always builds upon what already exists</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.640" end="01:02:35.359" style="s2">and so we have a</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.160" end="01:02:37.920" style="s2">global village of nations um</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.359" end="01:02:38.720" style="s2">uh right now we also have other entities</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.920" end="01:02:41.039" style="s2">we have</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.720" end="01:02:42.000" style="s2">obviously corporate entities we have</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.039" end="01:02:44.480" style="s2">religious</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.000" end="01:02:47.119" style="s2">entities these are the existing</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.480" end="01:02:50.240" style="s2">intermediate scales of social</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.119" end="01:02:52.319" style="s2">organization and uh</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.240" end="01:02:54.559" style="s2">with that is the starting point and this</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.319" end="01:02:57.359" style="s2">is something else which has happened</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.559" end="01:02:59.520" style="s2">in the past since it&#39;s and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.359" end="01:03:02.480" style="s2">based so much on a</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.520" end="01:03:04.720" style="s2">on a perspective it&#39;s a perspective</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.480" end="01:03:07.839" style="s2">change that can be the</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.720" end="01:03:07.839" style="s2">game uh</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.319" end="01:03:11.920" style="s2">uh changer and once again it&#39;s not new</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.200" end="01:03:14.960" style="s2">it&#39;s happened</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.920" end="01:03:17.039" style="s2">in the past and to some extent</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.960" end="01:03:19.839" style="s2">in the present it&#39;s for a nation for</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.039" end="01:03:23.119" style="s2">example or a leader of a nation</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.839" end="01:03:26.480" style="s2">to see themselves and their nation</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.119" end="01:03:30.480" style="s2">as a solid citizen of the world</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.480" end="01:03:33.599" style="s2">uh uh i have a conversation with um</p>

<p begin="01:03:41.920" end="01:03:46.000" style="s2">that basically reviews</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.520" end="01:03:47.119" style="s2">uh foreign policy of people like woodrow</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.000" end="01:03:49.440" style="s2">wilson</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.119" end="01:03:51.680" style="s2">who was a globalist i mean he was an</p>

<p begin="01:03:51.680" end="01:03:56.400" style="s2">example i mean he was responsible for</p>

<p begin="01:03:56.400" end="01:03:59.520" style="s2">one because not to be an isolationist</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.799" end="01:04:01.680" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.520" end="01:04:02.880" style="s2">basically it&#39;s that enlightened form of</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.680" end="01:04:05.039" style="s2">self-interest</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.880" end="01:04:06.720" style="s2">where if you&#39;re for our own long-term</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.039" end="01:04:09.039" style="s2">good we really have to</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.720" end="01:04:09.920" style="s2">to be working towards the towards the</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.039" end="01:04:12.240" style="s2">global good</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.920" end="01:04:14.000" style="s2">now that is a form of nationalism it is</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.240" end="01:04:16.480" style="s2">a form of patriotism</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.000" end="01:04:17.440" style="s2">but it it it&#39;s a form that subordinates</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.480" end="01:04:20.880" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.440" end="01:04:22.960" style="s2">to a higher good</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.880" end="01:04:24.640" style="s2">and then seeks to have a higher</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.960" end="01:04:27.119" style="s2">reputation</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.640" end="01:04:29.119" style="s2">towards that end and of course that</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.119" end="01:04:30.640" style="s2">involves sanctions against nations that</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.119" end="01:04:33.280" style="s2">don&#39;t do that and</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.640" end="01:04:35.039" style="s2">and that whole protective uh basically</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.280" end="01:04:36.079" style="s2">the core design principle is operating</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.039" end="01:04:38.839" style="s2">at a</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.079" end="01:04:40.000" style="s2">national scale so the point being is</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.839" end="01:04:43.039" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.000" end="01:04:46.319" style="s2">our current organizations</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.039" end="01:04:49.920" style="s2">governance structures of all kinds</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.319" end="01:04:51.920" style="s2">uh can be part of the solution</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.920" end="01:04:55.039" style="s2">as soon as they adopt that perspective</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.920" end="01:04:57.440" style="s2">of subordinating themselves to</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.039" end="01:04:59.039" style="s2">the higher global good and we see that</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.440" end="01:05:02.240" style="s2">for example with the pope&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.039" end="01:05:04.640" style="s2">encyclical our common home speaks to the</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.240" end="01:05:08.400" style="s2">whole earth not just to the catholic</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.640" end="01:05:10.799" style="s2">faith we get the dollar llama</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.400" end="01:05:12.000" style="s2">ethics for the whole world beyond</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.799" end="01:05:14.640" style="s2">religion</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.000" end="01:05:15.680" style="s2">and so it happens again and again that</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.640" end="01:05:18.000" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.680" end="01:05:20.079" style="s2">that entities are are not narrowly</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.000" end="01:05:22.880" style="s2">selfish they work for the common good</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.079" end="01:05:23.520" style="s2">and it&#39;s there that to succeed they need</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.880" end="01:05:26.960" style="s2">to apply</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.520" end="01:05:28.640" style="s2">those same golden principles those same</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.960" end="01:05:29.520" style="s2">principles that are needed at a small</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.640" end="01:05:31.680" style="s2">scale</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.520" end="01:05:34.640" style="s2">are needed at that large scale and the</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.680" end="01:05:34.640" style="s2">same flexibility</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.880" end="01:05:40.000" style="s2">you just recently had the opportunity to</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.440" end="01:05:42.400" style="s2">have a</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.000" end="01:05:43.520" style="s2">within the mind life institute series to</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.400" end="01:05:46.400" style="s2">have a conversation with</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.520" end="01:05:46.960" style="s2">with the dalai lama um right i&#39;ll link</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.400" end="01:05:49.680" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.960" end="01:05:51.119" style="s2">also to with all like with this</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.680" end="01:05:51.920" style="s2">conversation so people can have a look</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.119" end="01:05:55.359" style="s2">at it</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.920" end="01:05:57.839" style="s2">but is it so you mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.359" end="01:05:58.559" style="s2">that subsidiarity is a catholic concept</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.839" end="01:06:00.640" style="s2">i i</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.559" end="01:06:02.240" style="s2">i&#39;m aware of it as a political</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.640" end="01:06:04.480" style="s2">philosophy that is written into the</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.240" end="01:06:06.400" style="s2">european constitution and and that we</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.480" end="01:06:08.480" style="s2">should actually be governed in this way</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.400" end="01:06:09.920" style="s2">but i don&#39;t i&#39;m not aware of the the</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.480" end="01:06:13.359" style="s2">catholic past of this</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.920" end="01:06:14.880" style="s2">term enlighten me well i&#39;m not a scholar</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.359" end="01:06:19.119" style="s2">on the topic but i believe</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.880" end="01:06:21.440" style="s2">the concept originated uh in the uh</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.119" end="01:06:22.960" style="s2">in the catholic faith and then and then</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.440" end="01:06:25.280" style="s2">was borrowed by</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.960" end="01:06:27.119" style="s2">in the formation of the european union</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.280" end="01:06:28.880" style="s2">and basically the principle is is that</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.119" end="01:06:29.920" style="s2">the lower level entities should be able</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.880" end="01:06:32.720" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.920" end="01:06:33.599" style="s2">do things their way and the higher level</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.720" end="01:06:36.319" style="s2">entities</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.599" end="01:06:36.880" style="s2">such as the church should step in only</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.319" end="01:06:39.599" style="s2">when</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.880" end="01:06:41.119" style="s2">problems are caused higher up the scale</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.599" end="01:06:43.119" style="s2">and that&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.119" end="01:06:44.559" style="s2">principle of federalism is that the</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.119" end="01:06:48.480" style="s2">states and the</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.559" end="01:06:51.680" style="s2">cities and the towns have a degree of</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.480" end="01:06:53.440" style="s2">of authority to govern their affairs and</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.680" end="01:06:54.880" style="s2">only one that causes problems higher up</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.440" end="01:06:57.359" style="s2">the scale does something else kick</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.880" end="01:06:59.440" style="s2">in so and then the european union</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.359" end="01:07:03.520" style="s2">adopted those same uh</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.440" end="01:07:06.480" style="s2">those same principles</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.520" end="01:07:08.880" style="s2">but how do you sense like in in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.480" end="01:07:11.359" style="s2">implementing</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.880" end="01:07:13.680" style="s2">the eight design principles in a</p>

<p begin="01:09:54.000" end="01:09:58.159" style="s2">and then some of the conversations</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.679" end="01:10:01.280" style="s2">around which is an answer to your</p>

<p begin="01:10:01.280" end="01:10:04.560" style="s2">uh so the thesis of the third way is</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.040" end="01:10:06.960" style="s2">that there&#39;s two things that don&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.560" end="01:10:08.560" style="s2">and only one thing that can work</p>

<p begin="01:10:14.800" end="01:10:18.719" style="s2">robustly benefits the common good the</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.560" end="01:10:21.120" style="s2">metaphor of the invisible hand</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.719" end="01:10:23.040" style="s2">is profoundly untrue unless the</p>

<p begin="01:11:05.120" end="01:11:08.640" style="s2">around the target and then there must be</p>

<p begin="01:11:25.679" end="01:11:28.719" style="s2">one of the conversations is with jeffrey</p>

<p begin="01:11:33.920" end="01:11:39.360" style="s2">know before then you</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.440" end="01:11:41.040" style="s2">really should know that every concerted</p>

<p begin="01:11:41.040" end="01:11:45.360" style="s2">at socialism has been a cataclysmic</p>

<p begin="01:11:45.360" end="01:11:49.679" style="s2">and they for true reasons one is is they</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.840" end="01:11:52.719" style="s2">tried to do away with markets</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.679" end="01:11:54.560" style="s2">altogether and to base their economy on</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.719" end="01:11:55.520" style="s2">centralized planning that was problem</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.560" end="01:11:58.159" style="s2">number one</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.520" end="01:11:59.679" style="s2">problem number two was is that power got</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.159" end="01:12:00.560" style="s2">concentrated in the hands of a few</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.679" end="01:12:04.080" style="s2">elites</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.560" end="01:12:06.080" style="s2">and we know how that always goes so even</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.080" end="01:12:07.280" style="s2">for socialist movements that started out</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.080" end="01:12:10.640" style="s2">well meaning</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.280" end="01:12:13.360" style="s2">genuinely well-meaning and they</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.640" end="01:12:14.800" style="s2">all of them became basically</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.360" end="01:12:17.520" style="s2">totalitarian and</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.800" end="01:12:18.760" style="s2">failed abysmally because of their</p>

<p begin="01:12:18.760" end="01:12:24.239" style="s2">centralized uh planning and if we want</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.400" end="01:12:24.800" style="s2">some version of socialism we all have to</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.239" end="01:12:28.719" style="s2">be clear</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.800" end="01:12:32.159" style="s2">not that kind please then we have the</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.719" end="01:12:35.280" style="s2">areas of capitalism that are</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.159" end="01:12:36.960" style="s2">that are well known so what&#39;s in between</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.280" end="01:12:38.800" style="s2">what are some examples</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.960" end="01:12:41.120" style="s2">of the third way the third way is not</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.800" end="01:12:42.400" style="s2">new because it&#39;s the only thing that can</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.120" end="01:12:44.080" style="s2">work it&#39;s the only thing that ever has</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.400" end="01:12:45.679" style="s2">worked and so we can see them</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.080" end="01:12:47.920" style="s2">again and again described in all their</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.679" end="01:12:50.239" style="s2">local vocabularies as i mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.920" end="01:12:52.000" style="s2">mentioned before and it will come as no</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.239" end="01:12:54.080" style="s2">surprise</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.000" end="01:12:56.159" style="s2">that the nordic countries good old</p>

<p begin="01:13:04.480" end="01:13:07.120" style="s2">level would</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.120" end="01:13:08.239" style="s2">basically rank nations on how will they</p>

<p begin="01:13:08.239" end="01:13:15.840" style="s2">at the national scale if you look at the</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.840" end="01:13:17.360" style="s2">high end which always includes the</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.840" end="01:13:19.760" style="s2">nordic countries plus others we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.360" end="01:13:21.760" style="s2">want to focus exclusively on</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.760" end="01:13:23.679" style="s2">on the nordic countries and you find</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.760" end="01:13:28.000" style="s2">that these are societies that</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.679" end="01:13:30.960" style="s2">that uh work well and then come to</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.000" end="01:13:32.960" style="s2">look closer as to why they work well</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.960" end="01:13:34.320" style="s2">it&#39;s because they have actually created</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.960" end="01:13:37.199" style="s2">a wonderful</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.320" end="01:13:38.400" style="s2">balance their market economies make no</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.199" end="01:13:40.080" style="s2">mistake they are</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.400" end="01:13:41.520" style="s2">definitely market economies that are</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.080" end="01:13:44.960" style="s2">competing</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.520" end="01:13:46.000" style="s2">on the world stage but labor is also</p>

<p begin="01:13:46.000" end="01:13:50.400" style="s2">and the state is strong and they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.320" end="01:13:53.440" style="s2">working collaboratively</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.400" end="01:13:56.719" style="s2">in order to improve the national</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.440" end="01:13:59.840" style="s2">good and i was just i mean literally</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.719" end="01:14:02.880" style="s2">two days ago i had my conversation</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.840" end="01:14:05.520" style="s2">with some colleagues in norway on this</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.880" end="01:14:07.520" style="s2">topic for that series and just to give</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.520" end="01:14:08.800" style="s2">you a great illustration</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.520" end="01:14:10.880" style="s2">there&#39;s something called the flex</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.800" end="01:14:13.520" style="s2">security model</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.880" end="01:14:14.400" style="s2">that was first developed in denmark and</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.520" end="01:14:17.440" style="s2">is now</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.400" end="01:14:20.080" style="s2">practiced widely also in in norway and</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.440" end="01:14:22.560" style="s2">it goes this way</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.080" end="01:14:24.320" style="s2">because these small nations are exposed</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.560" end="01:14:27.440" style="s2">to the world economy</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.320" end="01:14:29.120" style="s2">they have to be really nimble on the</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.440" end="01:14:29.920" style="s2">market and so that means that any</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.120" end="01:14:31.840" style="s2">particular</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.920" end="01:14:32.960" style="s2">sector has to be able to hire and fire</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.840" end="01:14:36.159" style="s2">workers</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.960" end="01:14:37.199" style="s2">quite quickly you can&#39;t be stodgy that</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.159" end="01:14:40.159" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.199" end="01:14:42.000" style="s2">um and so there has to be security for</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.159" end="01:14:43.520" style="s2">workers but it can&#39;t be of the sort that</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.000" end="01:14:45.360" style="s2">they just have job security and they</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.520" end="01:14:48.080" style="s2">can&#39;t you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.360" end="01:14:49.600" style="s2">then then the economy couldn&#39;t couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.080" end="01:14:52.239" style="s2">need well so what they do is they</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.600" end="01:14:55.760" style="s2">combine the ability to hire and fire</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.239" end="01:14:58.719" style="s2">at will with a great social security</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.760" end="01:15:02.000" style="s2">system so that if you lose your job</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.719" end="01:15:03.600" style="s2">actually for a period of even four years</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.000" end="01:15:04.239" style="s2">initially now it&#39;s been reduced to two</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.600" end="01:15:07.520" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.239" end="01:15:09.199" style="s2">you could have continue on 90 of your</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.520" end="01:15:11.760" style="s2">salary</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.199" end="01:15:13.199" style="s2">until you can really train for the next</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.760" end="01:15:17.280" style="s2">job</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.199" end="01:15:20.800" style="s2">and so you combine social security</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.280" end="01:15:24.159" style="s2">with a responsive</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.800" end="01:15:26.480" style="s2">uh economy that&#39;s what they call flexi</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.159" end="01:15:28.800" style="s2">flex security and it was worked out</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.480" end="01:15:31.920" style="s2">basically by a collaborative</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.800" end="01:15:33.520" style="s2">arrangement with the labor unions and</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.920" end="01:15:36.880" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.520" end="01:15:40.000" style="s2">business sector with very strong state</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.880" end="01:15:41.120" style="s2">uh state involvement so these go by</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.000" end="01:15:44.159" style="s2">names such as</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.120" end="01:15:46.960" style="s2">uh democratic socialism</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.159" end="01:15:48.880" style="s2">uh and similar names which basically</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.960" end="01:15:50.400" style="s2">combine the word socialism</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.880" end="01:15:52.880" style="s2">that means that if everything is</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.400" end="01:15:56.800" style="s2">explicitly designed for the good of the</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.880" end="01:15:59.120" style="s2">society but also democratic</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.800" end="01:16:00.880" style="s2">there&#39;s your participation so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.120" end="01:16:03.840" style="s2">just in the hands of a few</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.880" end="01:16:05.360" style="s2">elites and then that&#39;s represented by an</p>

<p begin="01:16:05.360" end="01:16:09.360" style="s2">major sectors such as labor and capital</p>

<p begin="01:16:12.640" end="01:16:18.800" style="s2">there&#39;s our model uh and uh</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.640" end="01:16:20.080" style="s2">not hard to emulate every every nation</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.800" end="01:16:22.000" style="s2">has to find its own path</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.080" end="01:16:23.600" style="s2">there&#39;s more to be said about that but</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.000" end="01:16:26.480" style="s2">uh anyhow there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.600" end="01:16:28.480" style="s2">a there&#39;s a model to follow but but</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.480" end="01:16:29.199" style="s2">don&#39;t you find like i i saw a talk that</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.480" end="01:16:31.840" style="s2">you gave</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.199" end="01:16:33.199" style="s2">um to the business business for peace</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.840" end="01:16:36.800" style="s2">foundation</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.199" end="01:16:39.520" style="s2">and and you kind of contrasted that</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.800" end="01:16:40.480" style="s2">current economic orthodox economic</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.520" end="01:16:44.080" style="s2">design is</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.480" end="01:16:46.159" style="s2">i think what did you say um</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.080" end="01:16:48.080" style="s2">has an absurd conception of human nature</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.159" end="01:16:51.120" style="s2">has an absurd conception of</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.080" end="01:16:51.440" style="s2">um economic systems equilibrium and has</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.120" end="01:16:54.560" style="s2">an</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.440" end="01:16:57.520" style="s2">um absurd conception of theory</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.560" end="01:16:59.440" style="s2">um as nothingness and which i very much</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.520" end="01:17:00.159" style="s2">like because it kind of resonates with</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.440" end="01:17:01.679" style="s2">my</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.159" end="01:17:03.199" style="s2">issue around qualitative and</p>

<p begin="01:17:03.199" end="01:17:06.800" style="s2">for focuses or focus and then then you</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.320" end="01:17:08.480" style="s2">say that</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.800" end="01:17:09.840" style="s2">that the other option by building an</p>

<p begin="01:17:13.199" end="01:17:18.320" style="s2">um we can build it on the most current</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.400" end="01:17:21.520" style="s2">knowledge about human nature</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.320" end="01:17:23.760" style="s2">and social economic systems um in in all</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.520" end="01:17:25.679" style="s2">of their complexity and the conception</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.760" end="01:17:27.280" style="s2">that uh is commensurate with</p>

<p begin="01:17:27.280" end="01:17:32.480" style="s2">complexity the problem is that</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.719" end="01:17:38.640" style="s2">it seems like both academically and</p>

<p begin="01:17:38.640" end="01:17:42.400" style="s2">economics has built this</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.159" end="01:17:42.400" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.199" end="01:17:48.159" style="s2">wall of orthodoxy around it that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.080" end="01:17:51.600" style="s2">very difficult to actually</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.159" end="01:17:54.640" style="s2">um have these conversations with with</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.600" end="01:17:58.800" style="s2">about redesigning national</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.640" end="01:18:01.920" style="s2">and international economic uh policies</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.800" end="01:18:04.159" style="s2">are you making wrote there</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.920" end="01:18:05.920" style="s2">yeah so i mean i&#39;ve written extensively</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.159" end="01:18:07.920" style="s2">on that including that particular talk</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.920" end="01:18:10.000" style="s2">and it&#39;s absolutely the case that uh</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.920" end="01:18:11.760" style="s2">everything that we know with the you</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.000" end="01:18:14.560" style="s2">know gathered under the term homo</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.760" end="01:18:14.560" style="s2">economics</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.880" end="01:18:18.719" style="s2">is a huge part of the problem i talked</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.960" end="01:18:22.239" style="s2">about paradigmatic change</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.719" end="01:18:23.760" style="s2">earlier and so that&#39;s a paradigm that</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.239" end="01:18:25.760" style="s2">actually only became dominant after</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.760" end="01:18:29.040" style="s2">world war ii</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.760" end="01:18:30.320" style="s2">was a fringe position before then but</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.040" end="01:18:33.360" style="s2">then did become</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.320" end="01:18:34.960" style="s2">truly dominant remains dominant and</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.360" end="01:18:37.280" style="s2">has got to go basically it does have to</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.960" end="01:18:39.440" style="s2">be replaced with a more holistic view</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.280" end="01:18:43.199" style="s2">this represented by people such as k</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.440" end="01:18:45.920" style="s2">rayworth and her donut</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.199" end="01:18:47.760" style="s2">economics a systemic basically there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.920" end="01:18:50.880" style="s2">your third way</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.760" end="01:18:50.880" style="s2">a systemic goal</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.120" end="01:18:56.640" style="s2">and and means towards working towards</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.400" end="01:18:58.560" style="s2">that goal so the question becomes</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.640" end="01:19:00.560" style="s2">you know i mean how fast are we going to</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.560" end="01:19:03.920" style="s2">have that paradigm change</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.560" end="01:19:05.120" style="s2">uh so that we really leave homo</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.920" end="01:19:10.000" style="s2">economics</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.120" end="01:19:12.880" style="s2">behind and then we adopt this more um</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.000" end="01:19:14.880" style="s2">systemic approach and i&#39;ve been now kind</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.880" end="01:19:18.159" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.880" end="01:19:22.320" style="s2">beginning as a total outsider</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.159" end="01:19:25.120" style="s2">uh 10 or 12 years ago have now become</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.320" end="01:19:28.400" style="s2">more of an insider</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.120" end="01:19:31.360" style="s2">and i see a lot of flexibility i mean</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.400" end="01:19:32.880" style="s2">it&#39;s gotten to the point of collapse you</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.360" end="01:19:35.920" style="s2">know close enough to the</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.880" end="01:19:38.880" style="s2">point of collapse that uh people that</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.920" end="01:19:38.880" style="s2">are very well</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.440" end="01:19:44.000" style="s2">positioned inside the economic</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.600" end="01:19:47.280" style="s2">establishment they get it</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.000" end="01:19:49.440" style="s2">and they&#39;re really happy to to uh</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.280" end="01:19:50.719" style="s2">to experiment so i do think that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.440" end="01:19:53.360" style="s2">reached the point</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.719" end="01:19:54.640" style="s2">and it does take a collapse uh does take</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.360" end="01:19:56.960" style="s2">a crisis</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.640" end="01:19:58.000" style="s2">in order to move people beyond their</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.960" end="01:20:01.600" style="s2">entrenched</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.000" end="01:20:03.199" style="s2">uh uh positions but uh i think one thing</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.600" end="01:20:06.480" style="s2">i&#39;d like to do</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.199" end="01:20:08.159" style="s2">daniel is to talk a little bit more</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.480" end="01:20:10.320" style="s2">specifically about regenerative</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.159" end="01:20:13.679" style="s2">movements</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.320" end="01:20:15.360" style="s2">and to describe one that we&#39;re involved</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.679" end="01:20:17.440" style="s2">with with pro-social</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.360" end="01:20:19.199" style="s2">that i&#39;d like to get your opinion on it</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.440" end="01:20:20.800" style="s2">to see how closely it matches</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.199" end="01:20:22.880" style="s2">some of the regenerative movements that</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.800" end="01:20:26.800" style="s2">you&#39;re involved</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.880" end="01:20:28.960" style="s2">um with and uh this one is called</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.800" end="01:20:29.920" style="s2">forever green it&#39;s in uh based in</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.960" end="01:20:31.440" style="s2">minnesota</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.920" end="01:20:34.239" style="s2">and we&#39;re also working with a group</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.440" end="01:20:35.679" style="s2">called regenerate illinois</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.239" end="01:20:38.159" style="s2">and it&#39;s all about regenerative</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.679" end="01:20:40.080" style="s2">agriculture which is if</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.159" end="01:20:42.080" style="s2">if anything qualifies as a paradigm</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.080" end="01:20:44.960" style="s2">shift gets to</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.080" end="01:20:47.520" style="s2">transition from the current agricultural</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.960" end="01:20:50.719" style="s2">practices in the american midwest</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.520" end="01:20:50.719" style="s2">to a more regenerative</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.000" end="01:20:56.880" style="s2">form of agriculture using for example</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.880" end="01:21:00.080" style="s2">perennial crops</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.880" end="01:21:01.360" style="s2">so that so that you&#39;re not just breaking</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.080" end="01:21:03.120" style="s2">up the soil again</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.360" end="01:21:04.560" style="s2">and again and to create a system which</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.120" end="01:21:07.360" style="s2">is attuned to</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.560" end="01:21:09.199" style="s2">uh everything from biodiversity to of</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.360" end="01:21:10.880" style="s2">course management of the soil that turns</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.199" end="01:21:15.040" style="s2">into water management</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.880" end="01:21:17.360" style="s2">um and uh to be really holistic about</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.040" end="01:21:20.480" style="s2">the system that you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.360" end="01:21:23.440" style="s2">create and as soon as you try to do that</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.480" end="01:21:24.560" style="s2">then you realize that if you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.440" end="01:21:26.719" style="s2">for example</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.560" end="01:21:28.320" style="s2">raise a new crop such as a perennial</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.719" end="01:21:31.360" style="s2">wheat crop</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.320" end="01:21:33.360" style="s2">then there has to be a whole supply</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.360" end="01:21:36.800" style="s2">chain that you build</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.360" end="01:21:38.480" style="s2">around it you just can&#39;t insert that one</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.800" end="01:21:41.199" style="s2">practice you have to be working on the</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.480" end="01:21:43.840" style="s2">whole supply</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.199" end="01:21:45.520" style="s2">chain and so that is what and it should</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.840" end="01:21:48.080" style="s2">be at the watershed</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.520" end="01:21:49.600" style="s2">level if you&#39;re going to be ecologically</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.080" end="01:21:51.520" style="s2">sound you have to respect you have to</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.600" end="01:21:53.840" style="s2">start thinking about biological units</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.520" end="01:21:53.840" style="s2">not just</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.080" end="01:21:58.560" style="s2">units and so here we have like a number</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.199" end="01:22:03.280" style="s2">of movements that are</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.560" end="01:22:05.760" style="s2">like that and then the question is</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.280" end="01:22:08.080" style="s2">how well do they work and how much</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.760" end="01:22:10.239" style="s2">better might they work if</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.080" end="01:22:12.639" style="s2">we begin to come in with a program such</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.239" end="01:22:15.760" style="s2">as pro-social which is explicitly</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.639" end="01:22:17.440" style="s2">evolutionary uh</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.760" end="01:22:19.440" style="s2">not just in terms of the core design</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.440" end="01:22:22.800" style="s2">principles but in terms of this flexor</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.440" end="01:22:24.320" style="s2">flexibility but here&#39;s the thing we want</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.800" end="01:22:26.080" style="s2">to do but how do we actually do it how</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.320" end="01:22:29.199" style="s2">do we get them</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.080" end="01:22:32.719" style="s2">unstuck and become flexible about</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.199" end="01:22:35.120" style="s2">moving in uh at all scales from the</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.719" end="01:22:37.120" style="s2">individual to the small group so on and</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.120" end="01:22:38.719" style="s2">so on and so forth so this is just</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.120" end="01:22:39.920" style="s2">starting and i feel lucky that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.719" end="01:22:43.520" style="s2">been invited to</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.920" end="01:22:45.679" style="s2">to um to uh take part and it&#39;s the kind</p>

<p begin="01:22:45.679" end="01:22:52.880" style="s2">uh elsewhere so i hope that</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.800" end="01:22:54.239" style="s2">um that uh some of the projects that</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.880" end="01:22:57.040" style="s2">you&#39;re involved in</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.239" end="01:22:58.400" style="s2">then uh we could uh we could uh explore</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.040" end="01:23:00.080" style="s2">collaborative potential</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.400" end="01:23:01.520" style="s2">with you just as we are with that</p>

<p begin="01:23:18.880" end="01:23:22.080" style="s2">like living in a mediterranean climate</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.639" end="01:23:22.880" style="s2">and new york has a wonderful place to</p>

<p begin="01:23:22.880" end="01:23:27.520" style="s2">and i&#39;ll admit that but i also moved</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.080" end="01:23:31.280" style="s2">here because of the</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.520" end="01:23:33.520" style="s2">the conviction that the locus of focus</p>

<p begin="01:23:37.040" end="01:23:40.639" style="s2">that then has to be implemented</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.400" end="01:23:43.760" style="s2">everywhere else but but to show</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.639" end="01:23:44.800" style="s2">that you can turn an entire bioregional</p>

<p begin="01:24:05.840" end="01:24:10.000" style="s2">tourism industry has</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.280" end="01:24:10.320" style="s2">had that major disruption that i have</p>

<p begin="01:24:10.320" end="01:24:14.400" style="s2">talking to them for 10 years about but</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.560" end="01:24:15.280" style="s2">they always looked at me as the prophet</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.400" end="01:24:17.600" style="s2">of doom</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.280" end="01:24:18.480" style="s2">and and said we&#39;re earning more money</p>

<p begin="01:24:18.480" end="01:24:22.400" style="s2">um who is this guy telling us this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.880" end="01:24:24.719" style="s2">our days are numbered</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.400" end="01:24:25.840" style="s2">um and so there&#39;s a huge opportunity</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.719" end="01:24:28.880" style="s2">right now um</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.840" end="01:24:31.120" style="s2">to because of my my work</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.880" end="01:24:33.600" style="s2">working with the kind of forefront of</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.120" end="01:24:36.000" style="s2">the regenerative networks that have been</p>

<p begin="01:24:37.199" end="01:24:44.080" style="s2">some of the best people in that field</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.239" end="01:24:45.760" style="s2">to to work with the people of mallorca</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.080" end="01:24:46.880" style="s2">and the uniqueness of this mallorcan</p>

<p begin="01:24:46.880" end="01:24:53.600" style="s2">to explore a turnaround</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.880" end="01:24:54.400" style="s2">because the government is beginning to</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.600" end="01:24:55.760" style="s2">be much more</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.400" end="01:24:57.760" style="s2">willing to have those kind of</p>

<p begin="01:24:57.760" end="01:25:01.120" style="s2">and and one of the the ideas was i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.920" end="01:25:04.239" style="s2">know if you&#39;ve seen that</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.120" end="01:25:04.639" style="s2">that um the donut economics action lab</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.239" end="01:25:08.080" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.639" end="01:25:09.120" style="s2">um kate founded last year has started to</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.080" end="01:25:10.960" style="s2">work with</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.120" end="01:25:14.080" style="s2">the biomimicry institute and they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.960" end="01:25:16.400" style="s2">created funded by the c-40 network</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.080" end="01:25:19.120" style="s2">the cities network they&#39;ve created a</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.400" end="01:25:22.639" style="s2">methodology called thriving places</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.120" end="01:25:23.920" style="s2">um and and now kate&#39;s working with the</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.639" end="01:25:26.320" style="s2">city of amsterdam</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.920" end="01:25:28.560" style="s2">amsterdam has called itself a donut city</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.320" end="01:25:28.880" style="s2">they&#39;ve created the methodology of how</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.560" end="01:25:32.320" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.880" end="01:25:33.120" style="s2">basically ground the donut social</p>

<p begin="01:25:33.120" end="01:25:40.560" style="s2">and within ecological boundaries to to</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.239" end="01:25:42.239" style="s2">ground it in um in cities and i&#39;ve i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.560" end="01:25:43.360" style="s2">always had this conversation with kate</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.239" end="01:25:46.080" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.360" end="01:25:47.679" style="s2">ever since patrick getters we know um</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.080" end="01:25:48.719" style="s2">who wrote a wonderful book called cities</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.679" end="01:25:50.800" style="s2">and evolution which</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.719" end="01:25:52.320" style="s2">if you know it you know what he was like</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.800" end="01:25:56.239" style="s2">back in darwin&#39;s day he was the</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.320" end="01:25:59.280" style="s2">father of our planning and and so</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.239" end="01:26:00.639" style="s2">he he always said we a healthy city can</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.280" end="01:26:03.040" style="s2">only be planned within</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.639" end="01:26:05.600" style="s2">um its region and and so basically he</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.040" end="01:26:08.560" style="s2">was one of the first bioregionalists</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.600" end="01:26:10.000" style="s2">in academic terms um our species is a</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.560" end="01:26:12.239" style="s2">bioregional species so</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.000" end="01:26:13.840" style="s2">that like the pattern is is much older</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.239" end="01:26:16.159" style="s2">but i i&#39;m sure that</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.840" end="01:26:17.040" style="s2">like as this is building with i&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.159" end="01:26:20.080" style="s2">working with</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.040" end="01:26:21.280" style="s2">the um common land foundation the</p>

<p begin="01:26:24.800" end="01:26:29.120" style="s2">approach to ecosystems restoration uh</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.080" end="01:26:32.159" style="s2">what&#39;s it called</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.120" end="01:26:33.760" style="s2">four returns it&#39;s no i&#39;m not one of</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.159" end="01:26:35.760" style="s2">these parallel developments that i</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.760" end="01:26:37.520" style="s2">i don&#39;t know about yet i&#39;ll send you a</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.760" end="01:26:40.080" style="s2">link it&#39;s it&#39;s a little focused</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.520" end="01:26:41.280" style="s2">on the entry point is ecosystems</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.080" end="01:26:43.280" style="s2">restoration</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.280" end="01:26:45.920" style="s2">but because willem favila used to be the</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.280" end="01:26:47.040" style="s2">head of iucn netherlands and realized</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.920" end="01:26:50.960" style="s2">that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.040" end="01:26:52.080" style="s2">protect biodiversity hot spots if you</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.960" end="01:26:54.480" style="s2">don&#39;t work with the</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.080" end="01:26:55.280" style="s2">the regional economy and make it an</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.480" end="01:26:57.440" style="s2">incentive</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.280" end="01:26:58.480" style="s2">to want to protect it so it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.440" end="01:27:01.679" style="s2">can&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.480" end="01:27:04.480" style="s2">like if there&#39;s economic um</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.679" end="01:27:05.600" style="s2">difficulty in an area they will impinge</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.480" end="01:27:08.560" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.600" end="01:27:10.400" style="s2">protected biodiversity reserves and so</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.560" end="01:27:13.520" style="s2">he&#39;s developed a very</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.400" end="01:27:14.320" style="s2">agile language built around the four</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.520" end="01:27:16.320" style="s2">returns the</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.320" end="01:27:18.719" style="s2">return of inspiration the return of</p>

<p begin="01:27:18.719" end="01:27:22.159" style="s2">and eventually economic capital but what</p>

<p begin="01:27:22.159" end="01:27:27.280" style="s2">is very unique about his approach is</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.320" end="01:27:30.320" style="s2">that where they engage with</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.280" end="01:27:32.320" style="s2">a region they only do so if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.320" end="01:27:35.760" style="s2">commitment over 20 years so they</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.320" end="01:27:39.360" style="s2">um calculate in that that the turnaround</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.760" end="01:27:42.639" style="s2">of a of an ecological productive system</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.360" end="01:27:44.880" style="s2">has to have the length of</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.639" end="01:27:46.239" style="s2">change that the biological system needs</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.880" end="01:27:47.600" style="s2">so if you if you want to go from a</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.239" end="01:27:50.880" style="s2">heavily degraded</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.600" end="01:27:52.000" style="s2">landscape to a much more bioproductive</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.880" end="01:27:54.159" style="s2">landscape</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.000" end="01:27:56.320" style="s2">it you can have massive effects within</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.159" end="01:27:59.040" style="s2">the first three to six years but</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.320" end="01:28:00.239" style="s2">but to really establish it it takes 20</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.040" end="01:28:04.159" style="s2">years and</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.239" end="01:28:07.199" style="s2">and so i&#39;m i&#39;m trying to currently</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.159" end="01:28:09.280" style="s2">align the stars so to speak to work with</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.199" end="01:28:11.520" style="s2">a number of institutions also the</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.280" end="01:28:15.120" style="s2">capital institute&#39;s regenerative</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.520" end="01:28:17.360" style="s2">economics approach to</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.120" end="01:28:18.239" style="s2">use mallorca as a case study and and as</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.360" end="01:28:20.880" style="s2">that matures</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.239" end="01:28:21.920" style="s2">i would love to to involve you in that</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.880" end="01:28:24.960" style="s2">though yeah well let me</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.920" end="01:28:28.159" style="s2">let me uh this is so exciting because it</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.960" end="01:28:31.360" style="s2">says grand coalescence which needs to to</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.159" end="01:28:34.960" style="s2">uh to take place and so uh</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.360" end="01:28:38.400" style="s2">here&#39;s the kind of my part of this</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.960" end="01:28:41.199" style="s2">coalescing um and it illustrates some of</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.400" end="01:28:46.080" style="s2">the points we&#39;ve been made</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.199" end="01:28:49.360" style="s2">uh before so um only two years ago</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.080" end="01:28:53.120" style="s2">i attended a workshop</p>

<p begin="01:28:53.120" end="01:28:59.040" style="s2">seattle uh organized by a foundation</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.040" end="01:29:00.560" style="s2">that was basically a liberal progressive</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.040" end="01:29:03.280" style="s2">foundation they wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.560" end="01:29:04.639" style="s2">go beyond the neoliberal model they</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.280" end="01:29:06.320" style="s2">wanted actually they admired the</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.639" end="01:29:09.360" style="s2">montpellier society</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.320" end="01:29:11.040" style="s2">which was the organization that actually</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.360" end="01:29:12.000" style="s2">established the neoliberal model and</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.040" end="01:29:15.199" style="s2">they said</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.000" end="01:29:16.159" style="s2">we&#39;d like to repeat that act for a more</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.199" end="01:29:17.679" style="s2">progressive</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.159" end="01:29:19.760" style="s2">way of doing things there and that an</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.679" end="01:29:21.600" style="s2">economist named dennis snower who i did</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.760" end="01:29:23.360" style="s2">not know about before</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.600" end="01:29:25.120" style="s2">but he&#39;s very important man he was the</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.360" end="01:29:26.960" style="s2">president of the keel institute for</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.120" end="01:29:30.719" style="s2">world economics</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.960" end="01:29:34.000" style="s2">which organizes the t20 and</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.719" end="01:29:34.719" style="s2">g20 summit meetings so this is basically</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.000" end="01:29:38.239" style="s2">a world</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.719" end="01:29:39.920" style="s2">international economist and damned if he</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.239" end="01:29:41.760" style="s2">wasn&#39;t a convert to multi-level</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.920" end="01:29:42.480" style="s2">selection theory he&#39;d already read about</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.760" end="01:29:45.199" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.480" end="01:29:47.040" style="s2">stuff and he was persuaded he was</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.199" end="01:29:48.880" style="s2">persuaded so i started to work with</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.040" end="01:29:52.080" style="s2">diana&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.880" end="01:29:53.760" style="s2">um and he invited me to the t27 meetings</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.080" end="01:29:54.800" style="s2">and he started to talk about himself in</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.760" end="01:29:56.239" style="s2">his own talk so</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.800" end="01:29:58.800" style="s2">that&#39;s what i said you know the</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.239" end="01:30:01.760" style="s2">basically the orthodoxy the insiders the</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.800" end="01:30:02.719" style="s2">established economists are actually uh</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.760" end="01:30:06.719" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.719" end="01:30:09.440" style="s2">persuaded it&#39;s not it&#39;s becoming less uh</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.719" end="01:30:10.080" style="s2">heterodox and uh he&#39;s also involved in</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.440" end="01:30:12.480" style="s2">the uk</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.080" end="01:30:13.520" style="s2">and so he was helpful in me getting a</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.480" end="01:30:15.520" style="s2">grant from the</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.520" end="01:30:18.480" style="s2">economic and social science research</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.520" end="01:30:20.960" style="s2">council which was one of the main</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.480" end="01:30:23.520" style="s2">foundations in the in the uk and they</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.960" end="01:30:23.520" style="s2">have a whole</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.920" end="01:30:28.719" style="s2">program within the esrc called</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.159" end="01:30:31.760" style="s2">rebuilding macroeconomics so here again</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.719" end="01:30:35.360" style="s2">basically we have soul searching within</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.760" end="01:30:38.800" style="s2">the uh establishment</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.360" end="01:30:42.080" style="s2">so i got a actually quite a small grant</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.800" end="01:30:44.560" style="s2">to work with denison to implement</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.080" end="01:30:46.320" style="s2">pro-social and here&#39;s what we did</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.560" end="01:30:49.120" style="s2">we organized a training course and that</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.320" end="01:30:52.639" style="s2">training course was made available to</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.120" end="01:30:54.239" style="s2">small teams representing organizations</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.639" end="01:30:55.840" style="s2">and this is quite important because this</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.239" end="01:30:58.320" style="s2">course actually</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.840" end="01:30:59.920" style="s2">was a four-tier population structure</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.320" end="01:31:01.679" style="s2">within the course the students in the</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.920" end="01:31:03.040" style="s2">course were of course individuals that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.679" end="01:31:04.960" style="s2">tier one</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.040" end="01:31:06.400" style="s2">there were also memories of small teams</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.960" end="01:31:08.800" style="s2">that&#39;s tier two</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.400" end="01:31:10.400" style="s2">those teams represented organizations</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.800" end="01:31:12.960" style="s2">which i&#39;ll shortly list that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.400" end="01:31:14.320" style="s2">tier three and those organizations were</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.960" end="01:31:15.280" style="s2">interacting with each other through the</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.320" end="01:31:17.760" style="s2">teams</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.280" end="01:31:19.360" style="s2">there&#39;s tier four so what were these</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.760" end="01:31:23.440" style="s2">organizations</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.360" end="01:31:27.440" style="s2">well it included kate rayworth and diehl</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.440" end="01:31:28.719" style="s2">and she brought in circle economy which</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.440" end="01:31:30.880" style="s2">was organized in the</p>

<p begin="01:31:30.880" end="01:31:34.159" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.920" end="01:31:35.760" style="s2">mentioned plus a community group called</p>

<p begin="01:31:53.679" end="01:31:56.080" style="s2">interesting organization that formed</p>

<p begin="01:32:06.159" end="01:32:11.840" style="s2">the transition time network was</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.800" end="01:32:14.159" style="s2">a team all of them were taking this and</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.840" end="01:32:16.719" style="s2">learning about pro-social in relation to</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.159" end="01:32:19.760" style="s2">their own organizations which of course</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.719" end="01:32:22.159" style="s2">were already very dynamic and do you</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.760" end="01:32:24.800" style="s2">know they saw a lot of added</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.159" end="01:32:26.080" style="s2">value complementarity basically not</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.800" end="01:32:27.840" style="s2">competitors it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.080" end="01:32:29.920" style="s2">like oh we already do this that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.840" end="01:32:30.960" style="s2">what happened what happened was in a</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.920" end="01:32:34.639" style="s2">real</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.960" end="01:32:36.000" style="s2">synergy in terms of these organizations</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.639" end="01:32:37.840" style="s2">that are already are doing</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.000" end="01:32:40.480" style="s2">you know driving towards exactly the</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.840" end="01:32:42.159" style="s2">right thing turns out that actually to</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.480" end="01:32:42.960" style="s2">think about it more explicitly about</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.159" end="01:32:45.600" style="s2">managing</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.960" end="01:32:47.440" style="s2">the cultural evolutionary process</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.600" end="01:32:49.360" style="s2">according to evolutionary and complex</p>

<p begin="01:32:49.360" end="01:32:56.080" style="s2">was a considerable added</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.040" end="01:32:57.600" style="s2">value and so now we&#39;re at the point</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.080" end="01:32:59.280" style="s2">where we have a great working</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.600" end="01:33:02.800" style="s2">relationship with kate and</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.280" end="01:33:06.080" style="s2">these other organizations that we can</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.800" end="01:33:07.840" style="s2">actually work together so</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.080" end="01:33:10.560" style="s2">any legion that wants to become a donut</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.840" end="01:33:12.800" style="s2">economics region such as amsterdam or</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.560" end="01:33:15.600" style="s2">any place else including smaller scales</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.800" end="01:33:17.920" style="s2">by all means because that&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.600" end="01:33:18.639" style="s2">the systemic approach that we&#39;re working</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.920" end="01:33:22.239" style="s2">towards</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.639" end="01:33:23.840" style="s2">but in order to do that then i</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.239" end="01:33:25.440" style="s2">won&#39;t quite promise you because that</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.840" end="01:33:28.800" style="s2">would be too much hubris</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.440" end="01:33:31.280" style="s2">but i&#39;m confident that uh</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.800" end="01:33:33.280" style="s2">in an effort to do that if we work at</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.280" end="01:33:34.080" style="s2">the scale of small groups and then we</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.280" end="01:33:38.400" style="s2">implement</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.080" end="01:33:41.360" style="s2">a social then they will go better so um</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.400" end="01:33:44.080" style="s2">and it is inherently conclusive i mean</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.360" end="01:33:47.199" style="s2">those core design principles are</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.080" end="01:33:51.280" style="s2">fundamentally democratic and called for</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.199" end="01:33:54.400" style="s2">for co-production participatory</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.280" end="01:33:55.679" style="s2">action all those good things in which</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.400" end="01:33:57.840" style="s2">basically the group</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.679" end="01:34:00.000" style="s2">starting at the scale of smaller groups</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.840" end="01:34:03.120" style="s2">it genuinely consults them</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.000" end="01:34:05.040" style="s2">as to the role that they want for</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.120" end="01:34:08.800" style="s2">themselves what&#39;s meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.040" end="01:34:09.920" style="s2">for them and how to achieve it in the</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.800" end="01:34:13.120" style="s2">context</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.920" end="01:34:16.159" style="s2">of the greater the greater uh good</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.120" end="01:34:17.679" style="s2">so this makes me optimistic that uh</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.159" end="01:34:19.600" style="s2">that we could really catalyze the</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.679" end="01:34:22.159" style="s2">process of cultural evolution</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.600" end="01:34:22.880" style="s2">by this coalescing that&#39;s taking place</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.159" end="01:34:25.040" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.880" end="01:34:26.400" style="s2">my senses i mean if you haven&#39;t had a</p>

<p begin="01:34:26.400" end="01:34:30.239" style="s2">michael uh bowens and his team from the</p>

<p begin="01:34:34.320" end="01:34:41.119" style="s2">would have also a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.360" end="01:34:44.320" style="s2">overlap and synergy to discover um</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.119" end="01:34:46.320" style="s2">my my senses how do we</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.320" end="01:34:49.119" style="s2">like i i&#39;m definitely committed to</p>

<p begin="01:37:47.760" end="01:37:52.400" style="s2">the same time i see the need</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.239" end="01:37:53.600" style="s2">to value social capital and ecological</p>

<p begin="01:37:57.840" end="01:38:05.199" style="s2">got an opinion on on that issue i think</p>
<p begin="01:38:02.239" end="01:38:08.560" style="s2">that descends into a level of detail</p>
<p begin="01:38:05.199" end="01:38:12.159" style="s2">of implementation that uh</p>
<p begin="01:38:08.560" end="01:38:15.040" style="s2">i&#39;m no authority on uh and so</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.159" end="01:38:16.960" style="s2">and in some sense i don&#39;t have a comment</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.040" end="01:38:19.119" style="s2">on it specifically</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.960" end="01:38:20.800" style="s2">uh because it&#39;s just gonna have to be uh</p>
<p begin="01:38:19.119" end="01:38:22.000" style="s2">worked out i mean basically it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.800" end="01:38:23.600" style="s2">should we do it this way what are the</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.000" end="01:38:24.639" style="s2">dangers of doing it this way as opposed</p>
<p begin="01:38:23.600" end="01:38:28.400" style="s2">to doing it</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.639" end="01:38:31.760" style="s2">um uh that way and that reveals a very</p>
<p begin="01:38:28.400" end="01:38:34.960" style="s2">important point that ostrom eleanor made</p>
<p begin="01:38:31.760" end="01:38:37.440" style="s2">again and again distinguishing between</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.960" end="01:38:38.560" style="s2">a functional design principle and its</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.440" end="01:38:40.960" style="s2">implementation</p>
<p begin="01:38:38.560" end="01:38:41.679" style="s2">and so for a group to work well it needs</p>
<p begin="01:38:40.960" end="01:38:44.159" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.679" end="01:38:46.719" style="s2">implement these design principles in a</p>
<p begin="01:38:44.159" end="01:38:50.639" style="s2">functional sense but how they do so</p>
<p begin="01:38:46.719" end="01:38:54.000" style="s2">is highly contingent on the</p>
<p begin="01:38:50.639" end="01:38:56.480" style="s2">context so every group needs to monitor</p>
<p begin="01:38:54.000" end="01:38:59.679" style="s2">but how they monitor depends on</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.480" end="01:39:02.400" style="s2">the context and so on for all of the</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.679" end="01:39:03.360" style="s2">design uh principles and here i think</p>
<p begin="01:39:02.400" end="01:39:05.920" style="s2">we&#39;re getting into</p>
<p begin="01:39:03.360" end="01:39:07.199" style="s2">contextual issues of implementation in</p>
<p begin="01:39:05.920" end="01:39:08.239" style="s2">which but one thing we&#39;re going to have</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.199" end="01:39:10.400" style="s2">to do for sure</p>
<p begin="01:39:08.239" end="01:39:12.400" style="s2">when we assess our practices is to be</p>
<p begin="01:39:10.400" end="01:39:15.040" style="s2">holistic about it and to</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.400" end="01:39:16.719" style="s2">and to look at you know one of the what</p>
<p begin="01:39:15.040" end="01:39:20.239" style="s2">are the systemic consequences</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.719" end="01:39:24.000" style="s2">of of doing it this way versus uh</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.239" end="01:39:27.360" style="s2">uh versus uh um</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.000" end="01:39:31.280" style="s2">that way so i think that um</p>
<p begin="01:39:27.360" end="01:39:33.600" style="s2">uh we do want to to uh</p>
<p begin="01:39:31.280" end="01:39:34.480" style="s2">wrap up and i i want to give a sense of</p>
<p begin="01:39:33.600" end="01:39:37.290" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.480" end="01:39:39.119" style="s2">how this uh uh</p>

<p begin="01:39:39.119" end="01:39:42.880" style="s2">can can work i&#39;m glad that you mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.199" end="01:39:44.239" style="s2">multiple forms of capital because it</p>
<p begin="01:39:42.880" end="01:39:46.400" style="s2">means that if you&#39;re in a situation</p>
<p begin="01:39:44.239" end="01:39:48.800" style="s2">where there&#39;s not much financial capital</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.400" end="01:39:50.639" style="s2">but there&#39;s other forms of capital then</p>
<p begin="01:39:48.800" end="01:39:53.280" style="s2">it&#39;s possible to</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.639" end="01:39:54.080" style="s2">implement prosocial simply because</p>
<p begin="01:39:53.280" end="01:39:56.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a strong</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.080" end="01:39:57.840" style="s2">appetite for doing so so for example if</p>
<p begin="01:39:56.480" end="01:39:58.639" style="s2">you had any groups that you&#39;re working</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.840" end="01:40:02.560" style="s2">with</p>

<p begin="01:40:05.920" end="01:40:10.719" style="s2">a world i&#39;ll find facilitators for you</p>
<p begin="01:40:08.719" end="01:40:14.000" style="s2">and it can be done online</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.719" end="01:40:15.760" style="s2">uh so that uh so that we can get going</p>
<p begin="01:40:14.000" end="01:40:17.840" style="s2">no charge</p>
<p begin="01:40:15.760" end="01:40:19.760" style="s2">um of course if you do have something</p>
<p begin="01:40:17.840" end="01:40:21.199" style="s2">you know any kind of resources or a</p>
<p begin="01:40:19.760" end="01:40:22.000" style="s2">foundation like the peer-to-peer</p>
<p begin="01:40:21.199" end="01:40:24.239" style="s2">foundation or any</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.000" end="01:40:25.199" style="s2">other foundation would like to</p>
<p begin="01:40:24.239" end="01:40:27.520" style="s2">facilitate it</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.199" end="01:40:29.440" style="s2">and incentivize it so that people</p>
<p begin="01:40:27.520" end="01:40:31.440" style="s2">actually have financial capital and</p>

<p begin="01:40:31.440" end="01:40:35.600" style="s2">capital well of course it&#39;ll go better</p>
<p begin="01:40:33.920" end="01:40:37.840" style="s2">as long as we use those funds in the</p>
<p begin="01:40:35.600" end="01:40:39.040" style="s2">right in the right way but we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:40:37.840" end="01:40:41.679" style="s2">to wait for the money</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.040" end="01:40:43.040" style="s2">yeah in order to uh in order to do this</p>
<p begin="01:40:41.679" end="01:40:44.800" style="s2">there does have to be of course</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.040" end="01:40:48.639" style="s2">enthusiasm for doing it people</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.800" end="01:40:50.480" style="s2">have to be willing to need and act</p>
<p begin="01:40:48.639" end="01:40:51.840" style="s2">on the basis of what they what they</p>
<p begin="01:40:50.480" end="01:40:55.040" style="s2">decide there has to be</p>
<p begin="01:40:51.840" end="01:40:58.560" style="s2">some form of of uh</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.040" end="01:41:02.000" style="s2">of of capital but uh uh so</p>
<p begin="01:40:58.560" end="01:41:06.320" style="s2">uh uh we&#39;re we&#39;re structuring pro-social</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.000" end="01:41:09.199" style="s2">obviously to sustain itself</p>
<p begin="01:41:06.320" end="01:41:10.800" style="s2">so it has to have a financial model but</p>
<p begin="01:41:09.199" end="01:41:11.600" style="s2">to sustain itself in a way that it could</p>
<p begin="01:41:10.800" end="01:41:14.960" style="s2">offer</p>
<p begin="01:41:11.600" end="01:41:18.000" style="s2">uh offer itself uh for free</p>
<p begin="01:41:14.960" end="01:41:21.840" style="s2">basically when</p>
