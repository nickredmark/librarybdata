<p begin="00:00:09.320" end="00:00:14.730" style="s2">I&#39;m very excited about this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.639" end="00:00:17.580" style="s2">I have butterflies before each each time</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.730" end="00:00:20.039" style="s2">we we speak who anticipating</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.580" end="00:00:23.519" style="s2">anticipating it was was very it was</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.039" end="00:00:25.949" style="s2">germinating for me it when I was walking</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.519" end="00:00:27.990" style="s2">this morning I and I had been in trouble</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.949" end="00:00:30.660" style="s2">wisdom yesterday doing all this work I</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.990" end="00:00:32.550" style="s2">actually ran the deal logos workshop and</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.660" end="00:00:36.030" style="s2">you know talking with Jordan hall and</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.550" end="00:00:37.290" style="s2">with Nora Bateson and so and then all</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.030" end="00:00:38.760" style="s2">that was in my mind and then all the</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.290" end="00:00:41.129" style="s2">work that Chris and I have been doing</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.760" end="00:00:43.649" style="s2">and then our previous dialogue about</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.129" end="00:00:46.170" style="s2">soul all of that just sort of came</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.649" end="00:00:47.460" style="s2">together for me and so I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.170" end="00:00:48.719" style="s2">propose something to you I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.460" end="00:00:52.590" style="s2">you got a chance to read that email I</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.719" end="00:00:55.140" style="s2">said yes and III love the idea that you</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.590" end="00:00:57.180" style="s2">might have a theory about Hans Hans or</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.140" end="00:00:59.910" style="s2">something to do with beauty right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.180" end="00:01:02.250" style="s2">well no I what I want to do is so I have</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.910" end="00:01:03.539" style="s2">two I have two motives for this Mayo two</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.250" end="00:01:05.220" style="s2">reasons I think they&#39;re more than just</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.539" end="00:01:08.280" style="s2">motives I think they can justify them I</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.220" end="00:01:12.119" style="s2">think they&#39;re reasons so why is I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.280" end="00:01:14.159" style="s2">it&#39;s an argument that&#39;s designed to try</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.119" end="00:01:15.960" style="s2">and not completely answer your questions</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.159" end="00:01:17.549" style="s2">but leave at least give an integrated</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.960" end="00:01:19.350" style="s2">way of it answering the questions that</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.549" end="00:01:21.060" style="s2">you posed so I thought it would act as</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.350" end="00:01:22.890" style="s2">an excellent platform for the discussion</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.060" end="00:01:25.860" style="s2">because it&#39;s gonna talk about beauty and</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.890" end="00:01:28.560" style="s2">soul and do logos all of that great um</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.860" end="00:01:31.020" style="s2">and and then what I also wanted to do</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.560" end="00:01:33.900" style="s2">was I wanted to start playing and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.020" end="00:01:36.409" style="s2">in serious playing with you know what</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.900" end="00:01:38.909" style="s2">does argumentation look like now within</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.409" end="00:01:40.770" style="s2">dialectic right what does that look like</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.909" end="00:01:43.020" style="s2">because right now we&#39;re doing a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.770" end="00:01:44.820" style="s2">this other stuff and like we can talk a</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.020" end="00:01:46.560" style="s2">little bit later about you know what we</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.820" end="00:01:48.990" style="s2">what I did in the workshop if you want</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.560" end="00:01:50.430" style="s2">and and it&#39;s all great you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.990" end="00:01:52.740" style="s2">doing this amplification and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.430" end="00:01:54.720" style="s2">doing all this work and I was already</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.740" end="00:01:57.930" style="s2">getting people to start moving off of</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.720" end="00:01:59.939" style="s2">propositions into I proposed that and</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.930" end="00:02:01.680" style="s2">you know and that kind of move but I</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.939" end="00:02:04.579" style="s2">also want to try and start playing with</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.680" end="00:02:08.610" style="s2">okay but what did like what cuz argue</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.579" end="00:02:10.890" style="s2">argumentation like deal dialectic is not</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.610" end="00:02:13.240" style="s2">for closure right and it&#39;s not about</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.890" end="00:02:16.310" style="s2">coming to a conclusion so what</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.240" end="00:02:18.110" style="s2">argumentation have so what the thought</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.310" end="00:02:21.320" style="s2">that came to mind is exactly what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.110" end="00:02:23.330" style="s2">proposing here that the an argumentation</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.320" end="00:02:26.510" style="s2">is kind of like a setting forth of a</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.330" end="00:02:28.040" style="s2">platform that is supposed to you know is</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.510" end="00:02:30.890" style="s2">supposed to lead to something beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.040" end="00:02:33.410" style="s2">argumentation as the dialectic unfolds</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.890" end="00:02:36.230" style="s2">well guys I wanna maybe I can just step</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.410" end="00:02:38.270" style="s2">back just a little bit haha and say that</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.230" end="00:02:41.540" style="s2">our last conversation was about I</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.270" end="00:02:44.360" style="s2">proposed this notion of soul yes is and</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.540" end="00:02:46.370" style="s2">I asked you to speak about that and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.360" end="00:02:48.110" style="s2">John came up with the idea of reinvent</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.370" end="00:02:51.560" style="s2">geo would have the Latin word for</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.110" end="00:02:54.290" style="s2">reinventing and and reinventing which</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.560" end="00:02:56.140" style="s2">also means discovering right yes have I</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.290" end="00:02:58.370" style="s2">got that right and I also wholly</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.140" end="00:02:59.090" style="s2">rediscovering because these notions are</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.370" end="00:03:01.430" style="s2">very old</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.090" end="00:03:05.240" style="s2">so what we&#39;re inventing and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.430" end="00:03:07.670" style="s2">discovering at the same time and I then</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.240" end="00:03:10.970" style="s2">after our conversation I thought jeez we</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.670" end="00:03:13.850" style="s2">could reinvent everything you know soul</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.970" end="00:03:16.460" style="s2">we can reinvent beauty we can reinvent</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.850" end="00:03:18.470" style="s2">the world you know I don&#39;t mean to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.460" end="00:03:20.360" style="s2">inflationary but it&#39;s like if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.470" end="00:03:22.340" style="s2">moving into a new paradigm we have to</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.360" end="00:03:23.930" style="s2">reinvent how we see practically</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.340" end="00:03:26.570" style="s2">everything right that&#39;s exactly right</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.930" end="00:03:30.590" style="s2">and you I think we inventio is one of</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.570" end="00:03:32.600" style="s2">the central functions of dialectic is we</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.590" end="00:03:34.730" style="s2">invent here that&#39;s a reanimation if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.600" end="00:03:37.520" style="s2">going to be a meta psycho technology it</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.730" end="00:03:39.260" style="s2">has to be able to reinvent you all over</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.520" end="00:03:41.150" style="s2">the place if it&#39;s going to be effective</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.260" end="00:03:43.250" style="s2">and functional for us I think that&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.150" end="00:03:45.290" style="s2">think that&#39;s a pivotal point you just</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.250" end="00:03:47.660" style="s2">made there I don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.290" end="00:03:50.060" style="s2">inflationary at all I think the the</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.660" end="00:03:52.430" style="s2">right the the job of this is is to</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.060" end="00:03:54.530" style="s2">exactly allow us to return to where</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.430" end="00:03:57.170" style="s2">every we want to speak and find how to</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.530" end="00:03:59.510" style="s2">reanimate it and bring them bring the</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.170" end="00:04:02.120" style="s2">logos to it because all these concepts</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.510" end="00:04:04.040" style="s2">become lifeless and innocence and they</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.120" end="00:04:07.040" style="s2">become clichés and they become truisms</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.040" end="00:04:08.810" style="s2">and they stop meaning something and yet</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.040" end="00:04:11.840" style="s2">we have a sense that they&#39;re deeply</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.810" end="00:04:13.370" style="s2">meaningful on some level but but we stop</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.840" end="00:04:15.470" style="s2">we stop using them in any meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.370" end="00:04:20.000" style="s2">function and the only way we could bring</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.470" end="00:04:23.360" style="s2">them back is by let&#39;s say redefining</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.000" end="00:04:25.940" style="s2">them well so it&#39;s not just redefining</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.360" end="00:04:26.540" style="s2">the words its redefining how we see the</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.940" end="00:04:29.510" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.540" end="00:04:32.330" style="s2">yes yes and Andrey and reforming</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.510" end="00:04:34.310" style="s2">ourselves in the face of that what kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.330" end="00:04:37.010" style="s2">of transformation do we have to undergo</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.310" end="00:04:38.210" style="s2">to conform to the reality that&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.010" end="00:04:40.730" style="s2">disclosed because whenever there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.210" end="00:04:43.670" style="s2">disclosure there&#39;s also a demand on us</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.730" end="00:04:45.830" style="s2">in that we need to conform to that new</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.670" end="00:04:47.870" style="s2">disclosure we&#39;re gonna realize it and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.830" end="00:04:50.210" style="s2">I think what I want what I think you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.870" end="00:04:51.950" style="s2">provided me a good way of reframing what</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.210" end="00:04:53.660" style="s2">I was saying earlier I think this is a</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.950" end="00:04:56.750" style="s2">better way of saying it I want to try</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.660" end="00:04:58.760" style="s2">and reinvent you argumentation so that</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.750" end="00:05:00.710" style="s2">it&#39;s no it&#39;s no longer what it is become</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.760" end="00:05:02.720" style="s2">which is you know you know just the</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.710" end="00:05:05.300" style="s2">logical coherence of propositions in</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.720" end="00:05:06.950" style="s2">order to just establish a conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.300" end="00:05:08.810" style="s2">that&#39;s supposed to defeat your enemy I</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.950" end="00:05:11.930" style="s2">want to try and understand what was</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.810" end="00:05:13.460" style="s2">going on in this Socratic use of</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.930" end="00:05:15.290" style="s2">argumentation because very often those</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.460" end="00:05:16.760" style="s2">arguments don&#39;t come to conclusions in</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.290" end="00:05:17.570" style="s2">fact the arguments devolve into</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.760" end="00:05:21.280" style="s2">something else</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.570" end="00:05:24.800" style="s2">yeah and the problem perhaps with</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.280" end="00:05:28.640" style="s2">arguments generally as yeah as you say</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.800" end="00:05:30.620" style="s2">the rival risks you know they&#39;re painful</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.640" end="00:05:32.450" style="s2">whereas I probably a good argument if</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.620" end="00:05:34.460" style="s2">you come into the right spirit probably</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.450" end="00:05:34.820" style="s2">has some kind of a joy associated with</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.460" end="00:05:37.190" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.820" end="00:05:40.700" style="s2">if the two like people are having a</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.190" end="00:05:42.380" style="s2">wrestling match you know you might</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.700" end="00:05:44.990" style="s2">disagree but I think we&#39;re afraid to</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.380" end="00:05:47.510" style="s2">kind of disagree and we&#39;re in the social</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.990" end="00:05:52.250" style="s2">media age were afraid to wrestle with</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.510" end="00:05:54.470" style="s2">each other on some level so you know the</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.250" end="00:05:56.060" style="s2">plato&#39;s use a nickname because he was it</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.470" end="00:05:58.970" style="s2">means broad shoulder because he was a</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.060" end="00:06:02.060" style="s2">wrestler late on right I&#39;m a martial</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.970" end="00:06:03.320" style="s2">artist and so yeah the point I was</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.060" end="00:06:05.780" style="s2">saying this in the workshop yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.320" end="00:06:08.030" style="s2">the point is not being right the point</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.780" end="00:06:10.370" style="s2">is to come into right relationship both</p>

<p begin="00:06:10.370" end="00:06:15.650" style="s2">that&#39;s what respect originally met</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.580" end="00:06:17.780" style="s2">respect spec t arrests to see the thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.650" end="00:06:19.850" style="s2">properly it doesn&#39;t mean the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.780" end="00:06:21.620" style="s2">as the Uni be and I said what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.850" end="00:06:23.960" style="s2">trying to do is steer a middle path a</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.620" end="00:06:26.330" style="s2">very Buddhist notion between merely</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.960" end="00:06:28.880" style="s2">attacking people or merely agreeing with</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.330" end="00:06:31.100" style="s2">them we&#39;re trying instead to afford each</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.880" end="00:06:33.080" style="s2">of us getting to a place where we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.100" end="00:06:35.750" style="s2">get to on our own right because if we</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.080" end="00:06:38.030" style="s2">have too much agreement then we fall</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.750" end="00:06:40.139" style="s2">into a bubble of some kind yes yes you</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.030" end="00:06:43.979" style="s2">know and things get very dull and</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.139" end="00:06:46.039" style="s2">and cliche but if we&#39;re too antagonistic</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.979" end="00:06:49.529" style="s2">then we just you know then it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.039" end="00:06:51.300" style="s2">bloody blood everywhere and well nothing</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.529" end="00:06:54.569" style="s2">that&#39;s nothing we don&#39;t develop</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.300" end="00:06:57.180" style="s2">friendships and and that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.569" end="00:07:00.150" style="s2">well there&#39;s no conduction to respect</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.180" end="00:07:01.650" style="s2">and I want to I want to reinvent yo that</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.150" end="00:07:03.419" style="s2">because it&#39;s also been trivialized by</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.650" end="00:07:08.550" style="s2">some of the social dusts just as this</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.419" end="00:07:09.840" style="s2">course and but notice again to resonate</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.550" end="00:07:11.520" style="s2">with another topic we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.840" end="00:07:14.759" style="s2">hopefully bring into discussion today</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.520" end="00:07:17.219" style="s2">notice how both agreement and antagonism</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.759" end="00:07:19.110" style="s2">lead to an ugliness of speech right the</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.219" end="00:07:21.060" style="s2">one is the ugliness of dead conformity</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.110" end="00:07:23.849" style="s2">the ugh the other is the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.060" end="00:07:26.400" style="s2">ugliness of confrontation and threat and</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.849" end="00:07:29.729" style="s2">again trying to instead get back to what</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.400" end="00:07:31.560" style="s2">it is to beautify speech I want it I</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.729" end="00:07:32.819" style="s2">want I want to try and get argumentation</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.560" end="00:07:36.779" style="s2">that and Chris and I were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.819" end="00:07:39.300" style="s2">this is like that but my thinking isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.779" end="00:07:42.150" style="s2">set and then I speak it to convince you</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.300" end="00:07:44.909" style="s2">it&#39;s instead as I try to articulate to</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.150" end="00:07:46.979" style="s2">you my thoughts my thoughts I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.909" end="00:07:49.289" style="s2">reinvent healing my thoughts that in</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.979" end="00:07:51.000" style="s2">speaking them I discover something in</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.289" end="00:07:52.979" style="s2">the speaking that I didn&#39;t have before I</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.000" end="00:07:55.589" style="s2">spoke them to you that&#39;s what I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.979" end="00:07:57.270" style="s2">trying to get out so this metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.589" end="00:07:58.889" style="s2">mm-hmm the rest thing metaphor works</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.270" end="00:08:01.740" style="s2">well for that purpose to because if you</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.889" end="00:08:03.990" style="s2">think every particular proposition every</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.740" end="00:08:06.000" style="s2">proposed speech act and the way that you</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.990" end="00:08:08.310" style="s2">and I have talked about it John makes a</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.000" end="00:08:11.069" style="s2">particular space and the interaction and</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.310" end="00:08:14.089" style="s2">so the entire form of the dialogue is an</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.069" end="00:08:17.580" style="s2">act of spatialization right that you</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.089" end="00:08:20.759" style="s2">test the spatial awareness of your body</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.580" end="00:08:24.210" style="s2">even as you exert and are exerted by</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.759" end="00:08:26.370" style="s2">your dialogic partners so the co plates</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.210" end="00:08:29.550" style="s2">or the co creative act is actually an</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.370" end="00:08:31.589" style="s2">act of of using the form of embodiment</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.550" end="00:08:34.289" style="s2">in this case the embodiment of speech</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.589" end="00:08:36.570" style="s2">itself as a way of making exploratory</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.289" end="00:08:38.459" style="s2">space to then venture ever further ever</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.570" end="00:08:40.289" style="s2">further ever further into that space and</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.459" end="00:08:41.490" style="s2">definitional discussions are interesting</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.289" end="00:08:43.919" style="s2">for that reason because if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.490" end="00:08:47.250" style="s2">thinking of the definition of a term as</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.919" end="00:08:48.870" style="s2">a multi vocalist solar dialogue or love</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.250" end="00:08:52.410" style="s2">or any of the things that we might be</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.870" end="00:08:53.130" style="s2">able to to put into this arena and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.410" end="00:08:56.370" style="s2">rest</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.130" end="00:08:58.200" style="s2">with our really it&#39;s I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.370" end="00:09:00.330" style="s2">helpful to think metaphorically of each</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.200" end="00:09:04.080" style="s2">of these definitions as spaces in which</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.330" end="00:09:06.690" style="s2">to play that the definition is something</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.080" end="00:09:09.120" style="s2">to be inhabited in order to then Illume</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.690" end="00:09:12.960" style="s2">more territory around it as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.120" end="00:09:15.330" style="s2">something that we treat as as leading to</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.960" end="00:09:16.800" style="s2">a fixed point of closure I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.330" end="00:09:18.990" style="s2">exactly right because and that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.800" end="00:09:21.360" style="s2">so that&#39;s when I was doing the workshop</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.990" end="00:09:23.490" style="s2">I tried to move people I made people</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.360" end="00:09:25.830" style="s2">actually engage in the speaker to</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.490" end="00:09:27.990" style="s2">remember that proposition originally</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.830" end="00:09:31.740" style="s2">comes from the speech octave I proposed</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.990" end="00:09:34.710" style="s2">which is not the same thing as this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.740" end="00:09:38.220" style="s2">the case right it&#39;s a very different</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.710" end="00:09:39.930" style="s2">things I try to bring that back out with</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.220" end="00:09:41.850" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s the Metin it&#39;s the it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.930" end="00:09:45.630" style="s2">metonymy again right everything is put</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.850" end="00:09:48.330" style="s2">for something greater put for something</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.630" end="00:09:49.530" style="s2">beyond it so everything if there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.330" end="00:09:51.270" style="s2">acknowledgment that every proposition</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.530" end="00:09:53.010" style="s2">every gesture in the dialogue is</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.270" end="00:09:55.230" style="s2">abbreviated knowingly and</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.010" end="00:09:57.060" style="s2">self-consciously abbreviated then it</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.230" end="00:09:58.380" style="s2">always has its eye fixed beyond its</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.060" end="00:10:00.960" style="s2">point of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.380" end="00:10:04.800" style="s2">mmm beautiful yeah yeah so it never</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.960" end="00:10:07.560" style="s2">becomes reified or stuck yeah and and</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.800" end="00:10:10.770" style="s2">and there&#39;s always a living force moving</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.560" end="00:10:13.050" style="s2">through it which again I think all of</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.770" end="00:10:15.810" style="s2">these things keep coming together in my</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.050" end="00:10:19.500" style="s2">mind which leads to soul and beauty</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.810" end="00:10:21.780" style="s2">because yeah well because what has soul</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.500" end="00:10:24.210" style="s2">is is what it what is alive right what</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.780" end="00:10:26.490" style="s2">is what what continues to move through</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.210" end="00:10:28.290" style="s2">us and and what is beautiful is also</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.490" end="00:10:30.840" style="s2">what is alive inand what what is</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.290" end="00:10:33.150" style="s2">meaningful and not what is is stuck in</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.840" end="00:10:39.030" style="s2">and frozen and broken and fragmented and</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.150" end="00:10:41.400" style="s2">and ugly and right know that I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.030" end="00:10:43.980" style="s2">mean to that this is right I just was</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.400" end="00:10:45.000" style="s2">you know I was excited when you said you</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.980" end="00:10:46.410" style="s2">know all of these things are coming</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.000" end="00:10:48.510" style="s2">together in your mind because that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.410" end="00:10:50.040" style="s2">original meaning of logos bring things</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.510" end="00:10:50.580" style="s2">together so that they come to belong</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.040" end="00:10:52.920" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.580" end="00:10:55.020" style="s2">and that&#39;s something much much more than</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.920" end="00:10:56.520" style="s2">what we&#39;ve reduced it to logos is the</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.020" end="00:10:57.870" style="s2">basis of our word logic and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.520" end="00:11:00.090" style="s2">reduced that to a coherence between</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.870" end="00:11:02.070" style="s2">propositions but what you were talking</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.090" end="00:11:03.780" style="s2">about there Andrew about how things come</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.070" end="00:11:05.769" style="s2">together so they belong together and</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.780" end="00:11:07.809" style="s2">they&#39;re in sold together and become a</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.769" end="00:11:10.179" style="s2">live together that&#39;s the meaning of</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.809" end="00:11:13.029" style="s2">logos and logical coherence is only one</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.179" end="00:11:16.779" style="s2">aspect of that much richer manifold</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.029" end="00:11:20.110" style="s2">right so we&#39;re trying to reinvent logos</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.779" end="00:11:23.110" style="s2">yet all right to mean something not not</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.110" end="00:11:27.639" style="s2">in this narrow logic just a logicians</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.110" end="00:11:31.179" style="s2">kind of game um and we&#39;re also trying to</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.639" end="00:11:32.980" style="s2">what about what about my friend</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.179" end="00:11:35.739" style="s2">Alexander always talks about mythos and</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.980" end="00:11:37.720" style="s2">pathos as well sure that those those two</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.739" end="00:11:40.239" style="s2">kind of work together so mythos is the</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.720" end="00:11:42.579" style="s2">story is the the formal form of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.239" end="00:11:46.629" style="s2">story and pathos is the deep sort of</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.579" end="00:11:48.339" style="s2">feeling aspect to it and and if you get</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.629" end="00:11:51.699" style="s2">if perhaps if we get too hung up on</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.339" end="00:11:53.319" style="s2">logos we lose we lose our sense of</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.699" end="00:11:57.389" style="s2">feeling and if we get too hung up on</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.319" end="00:12:01.600" style="s2">mythos you know the story becomes too</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.389" end="00:12:02.889" style="s2">sealed or closed or I&#39;m making sense</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.600" end="00:12:05.470" style="s2">here and that all those three not to</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.889" end="00:12:08.739" style="s2">work together logos mythos and pathos</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.470" end="00:12:10.990" style="s2">but that&#39;s and that&#39;s what makes go for</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.739" end="00:12:12.279" style="s2">it um okay I&#39;ll go ahead I&#39;m just going</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.990" end="00:12:16.480" style="s2">to say but that&#39;s that&#39;s the point of</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.279" end="00:12:17.559" style="s2">the like when you&#39;re doing the dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.480" end="00:12:21.970" style="s2">when you want reading one of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.559" end="00:12:23.439" style="s2">dialogues the like you know discipline</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.970" end="00:12:25.240" style="s2">ik I think it&#39;s really important to Drew</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.439" end="00:12:26.470" style="s2">Harlan and others have made you you</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.240" end="00:12:28.689" style="s2">don&#39;t pay attention to just the</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.470" end="00:12:30.279" style="s2">argumentation the argumentation is where</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.689" end="00:12:32.649" style="s2">you see the putting forth of</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.279" end="00:12:35.110" style="s2">propositions but the drama is where you</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.649" end="00:12:37.389" style="s2">see a putting forth of ways of life and</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.110" end="00:12:40.029" style="s2">drama is likely where the mythos and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.389" end="00:12:43.089" style="s2">pathos you that&#39;s why that&#39;s why Plato</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.029" end="00:12:44.829" style="s2">does his philosophy in dialog because</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.089" end="00:12:48.129" style="s2">it&#39;s only in dialogue that you can get</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.829" end="00:12:50.949" style="s2">the wedding of the of the drama and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.129" end="00:12:52.329" style="s2">discourse so smoothly together hmm yes</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.949" end="00:12:53.740" style="s2">yes exactly</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.329" end="00:12:55.899" style="s2">and only in and only in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.740" end="00:12:58.779" style="s2">dramaturgical context can logos to have</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.899" end="00:13:01.480" style="s2">a questing character yes there is an</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.779" end="00:13:03.399" style="s2">implicit narrativity to the dialogues</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.480" end="00:13:04.809" style="s2">precisely because there&#39;s a quest right</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.399" end="00:13:06.369" style="s2">and that&#39;s why the dialogues are such a</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.809" end="00:13:08.290" style="s2">beautiful marriage of the logos and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.369" end="00:13:10.269" style="s2">mythos because the characterization of</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.290" end="00:13:12.669" style="s2">the quest of logos is implicit to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.269" end="00:13:15.309" style="s2">function of the dialogue itself yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.669" end="00:13:17.619" style="s2">questions which are propositional are</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.309" end="00:13:19.279" style="s2">actually just the affordance of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.619" end="00:13:22.339" style="s2">speech act thinking</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.279" end="00:13:23.629" style="s2">of questing that&#39;s exactly the right way</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.339" end="00:13:28.790" style="s2">to put it Chris I think that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.629" end="00:13:31.189" style="s2">good yeah hmm so shall shall I begin</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.790" end="00:13:34.129" style="s2">some of my proposals please please yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.189" end="00:13:36.769" style="s2">so maybe maybe let me go through sort of</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.129" end="00:13:38.809" style="s2">sort of the four main things the</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.769" end="00:13:40.699" style="s2">proposals and then we can go back and</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.809" end="00:13:43.009" style="s2">trace through it a however you gentlemen</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.699" end="00:13:45.769" style="s2">wish to well and then we&#39;ll just follow</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.009" end="00:13:49.670" style="s2">as Socrates often says we will follow</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.769" end="00:13:51.139" style="s2">the argument wherever it goes okay so</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.670" end="00:13:54.110" style="s2">the first thing I wanted to do was I</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.139" end="00:13:55.759" style="s2">wanted to bring up the connection so I</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.110" end="00:13:58.189" style="s2">want to first of all make clear to</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.759" end="00:13:59.990" style="s2">everybody who might be listening that</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.189" end="00:14:02.240" style="s2">andrew was very kind to send a set of</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.990" end="00:14:03.290" style="s2">questions and I thought originally I was</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.240" end="00:14:04.939" style="s2">just gonna think about how he&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.290" end="00:14:06.980" style="s2">answer each question better than I I</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.939" end="00:14:08.569" style="s2">thought maybe what I should do is try</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.980" end="00:14:10.490" style="s2">and logo so I should try and draw them</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.569" end="00:14:13.610" style="s2">together into mutually supporting</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.490" end="00:14:16.459" style="s2">proposals and so the first so Andrew had</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.610" end="00:14:17.990" style="s2">some questions and he&#39;s just also spoken</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.459" end="00:14:22.910" style="s2">earlier about you know connections</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.990" end="00:14:24.500" style="s2">between beauty and soul and so I want to</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.910" end="00:14:27.709" style="s2">pick up on our previous discussion about</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.500" end="00:14:30.949" style="s2">this idea of the reinvent you of soul as</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.709" end="00:14:33.139" style="s2">that which mediates Mattacks ooh is that</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.949" end="00:14:35.509" style="s2">the alog in between us between more</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.139" end="00:14:35.809" style="s2">nests and suchness so quite a bit about</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.509" end="00:14:38.809" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.809" end="00:14:41.300" style="s2">the mediator yeah yes it was the</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.809" end="00:14:43.910" style="s2">mediator like I don&#39;t know if you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.300" end="00:14:45.230" style="s2">this movie metropolis this fairy what I</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.910" end="00:14:47.360" style="s2">do you&#39;re talking you talk to the</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.230" end="00:14:50.509" style="s2">mediator as the guy who brings together</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.360" end="00:14:55.160" style="s2">the head and the heart brings together</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.509" end="00:14:58.430" style="s2">the head and heart so yeah yeah Don has</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.160" end="00:15:00.319" style="s2">a big poster of Metropolis it&#39;s given me</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.430" end="00:15:01.699" style="s2">the original like a print of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.319" end="00:15:04.009" style="s2">original poster from metropolis that</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.699" end="00:15:05.809" style="s2">movie just sings to me repeatedly so</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.009" end="00:15:08.540" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a beautiful illusion Andrew</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.809" end="00:15:12.139" style="s2">thank you for that okay so I was</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.540" end="00:15:15.230" style="s2">thinking about and so when we come back</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.139" end="00:15:18.139" style="s2">and review the first proposal</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.230" end="00:15:21.019" style="s2">I was thinking especially what you said</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.139" end="00:15:22.639" style="s2">because Andrew about Hans book I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.019" end="00:15:25.459" style="s2">saving Beauty because I also think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.639" end="00:15:26.839" style="s2">a really important work and so we can</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.459" end="00:15:28.309" style="s2">come back to that but I was thinking it</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.839" end="00:15:30.259" style="s2">so I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about beauty</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.309" end="00:15:33.020" style="s2">and of course because it plays this very</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.259" end="00:15:35.570" style="s2">important role in beautification with</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.020" end="00:15:39.100" style="s2">the dialogues and so I was trying I was</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.570" end="00:15:41.180" style="s2">thinking about the correlation between</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.100" end="00:15:43.730" style="s2">soul and beauty that you were making</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.180" end="00:15:45.710" style="s2">Andrew I want to unpack that in this</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.730" end="00:15:47.810" style="s2">proposal so I want to propose to you</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.710" end="00:15:51.200" style="s2">that there&#39;s a continuum there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.810" end="00:15:54.050" style="s2">continuum in our experience in right and</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.200" end="00:15:58.370" style="s2">now I&#39;m doing a tone us attention right</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.050" end="00:16:01.610" style="s2">there&#39;s a continuum between experiences</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.370" end="00:16:04.580" style="s2">that emphasize suchness and experiences</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.610" end="00:16:07.850" style="s2">that emphasize more Ness so overwhelming</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.580" end="00:16:11.420" style="s2">more Ness is horror right and then a</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.850" end="00:16:14.510" style="s2">little little less overwhelming is awe a</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.420" end="00:16:16.820" style="s2">little less overwhelming is wonder now</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.510" end="00:16:18.500" style="s2">let&#39;s go on the other side when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.820" end="00:16:20.180" style="s2">really picking up on the suchness people</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.500" end="00:16:23.000" style="s2">express that with this positive term of</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.180" end="00:16:24.710" style="s2">intimacy I know you intimately alright</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.000" end="00:16:26.750" style="s2">and then if that&#39;s taking a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.710" end="00:16:30.170" style="s2">deeper you people talk about being at</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.750" end="00:16:32.150" style="s2">peace with each other and then even more</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.170" end="00:16:33.350" style="s2">deeper a sense of being at home with</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.150" end="00:16:35.150" style="s2">someone and you know Chris what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.350" end="00:16:37.460" style="s2">doing here I&#39;m picking up on right home</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.150" end="00:16:40.850" style="s2">and horror as aspects of the sacred</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.460" end="00:16:42.770" style="s2">right matter valency bar we get that</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.850" end="00:16:46.250" style="s2">thing where right it&#39;s all it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.770" end="00:16:48.290" style="s2">too enclosed right what I&#39;m proposing to</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.250" end="00:16:51.800" style="s2">you is the following beauty is that</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.290" end="00:16:54.020" style="s2">sweet spot it&#39;s the sweet spot on that</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.800" end="00:16:57.380" style="s2">continuum it&#39;s kind of a meta optimal</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.020" end="00:16:59.810" style="s2">grip right it&#39;s it&#39;s the tone us between</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.380" end="00:17:02.390" style="s2">being alive to the more nest and Wonder</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.810" end="00:17:04.490" style="s2">and being alive to the suchness and</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.390" end="00:17:06.200" style="s2">intimacy and this is picking up on</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.490" end="00:17:08.480" style="s2">scara&#39;s notion that when I encounter</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.200" end="00:17:10.490" style="s2">something beautiful I both get a sense</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.480" end="00:17:12.709" style="s2">of wow then she gives the example of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.490" end="00:17:14.570" style="s2">tree right all right you come across a</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.709" end="00:17:16.160" style="s2">beautiful tree I didn&#39;t know trees could</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.570" end="00:17:18.890" style="s2">be like that there&#39;s a sudden more nests</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.160" end="00:17:21.190" style="s2">but this tree is also not like any other</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.890" end="00:17:24.520" style="s2">tree it has a suchness to it an</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.190" end="00:17:26.630" style="s2">individual to it that is right</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.520" end="00:17:28.070" style="s2">non-repeatable there&#39;s a hereness</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.630" end="00:17:30.380" style="s2">announced that&#39;s precious</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.070" end="00:17:32.060" style="s2">so the intimacy gives a preciousness of</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.380" end="00:17:35.390" style="s2">you&#39;ll allow me not sorry it&#39;s not my</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.060" end="00:17:35.960" style="s2">golden but I shouldn&#39;t write to them in</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.390" end="00:17:37.960" style="s2">the morning</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.960" end="00:17:41.240" style="s2">so the mortise is not an abstract</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.960" end="00:17:41.960" style="s2">conception it&#39;s its presence right into</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.240" end="00:17:44.390" style="s2">the suchness</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.960" end="00:17:46.250" style="s2">so you see what I&#39;m trying to do Andrew</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.390" end="00:17:46.760" style="s2">here I&#39;m trying to propose to you that</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.250" end="00:17:49.840" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.760" end="00:17:53.090" style="s2">faculty of soul that mediates between</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.840" end="00:17:55.610" style="s2">more nests and suchness is actually the</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.090" end="00:17:59.720" style="s2">Faculty of the reception of beauty that</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.610" end="00:18:01.970" style="s2">because beauty is the aesthetics the the</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.720" end="00:18:04.250" style="s2">forming of our sensibility that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.970" end="00:18:08.410" style="s2">finding that sweet spot between the more</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.250" end="00:18:12.620" style="s2">nosov wonder and the intimacy of such</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.410" end="00:18:15.710" style="s2">and so I think that picks up on scurries</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.620" end="00:18:18.530" style="s2">notion of how beauty is actually a deep</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.710" end="00:18:20.450" style="s2">kind of training for us ok so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.530" end="00:18:22.910" style="s2">first proposal the first proposal is</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.450" end="00:18:25.310" style="s2">that there&#39;s a deep so I&#39;m trying to I</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.910" end="00:18:27.410" style="s2">think you had a really important insight</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.310" end="00:18:29.090" style="s2">there Andrew and you see what I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.410" end="00:18:30.920" style="s2">to do I&#39;m trying to propose I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.090" end="00:18:32.600" style="s2">unpack it and that&#39;s what the arguments</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.920" end="00:18:35.270" style="s2">doing it&#39;s saying here&#39;s some things</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.600" end="00:18:38.630" style="s2">that I think come from that unfold from</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.270" end="00:18:42.850" style="s2">that so that&#39;s the first proposal is</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.630" end="00:18:46.190" style="s2">that ok yeah here&#39;s the second proposal</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.850" end="00:18:49.370" style="s2">the second proposal is a notion of</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.190" end="00:18:51.110" style="s2">wisdom that I get from Socrates though</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.370" end="00:18:54.230" style="s2">of the relationship between wisdom and</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.110" end="00:18:56.360" style="s2">virtue that each virtue is just a</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.230" end="00:18:58.610" style="s2">particular way of being wise in a</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.360" end="00:19:00.440" style="s2">particular kind of situation so being</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.610" end="00:19:03.710" style="s2">wise in this situation is to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.440" end="00:19:05.780" style="s2">courageous to be kind in this so to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.710" end="00:19:09.520" style="s2">wise in this situation is to be kind to</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.780" end="00:19:12.200" style="s2">be right so the idea is that virtues our</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.520" end="00:19:14.540" style="s2">particular instantiations pick</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.200" end="00:19:19.880" style="s2">particular ways of fitting right to</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.540" end="00:19:23.090" style="s2">particular context so now making use of</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.880" end="00:19:25.730" style="s2">Aristotle&#39;s notion of you know a virtue</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.090" end="00:19:26.290" style="s2">always being between too much and too</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.730" end="00:19:28.760" style="s2">little</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.290" end="00:19:30.320" style="s2">mm-hmm no now I&#39;m gonna try and draw</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.760" end="00:19:37.660" style="s2">them together here&#39;s the logos in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.320" end="00:19:40.010" style="s2">proposal I think that wisdom has a has a</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.660" end="00:19:41.720" style="s2">more honest aspect to it a self</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.010" end="00:19:43.700" style="s2">transcendent aspect and the Greeks had a</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.720" end="00:19:48.050" style="s2">word for this aspect of wisdom this was</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.700" end="00:19:49.520" style="s2">Sophia this is the mourners but they</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.050" end="00:19:51.590" style="s2">also had another word that&#39;s often</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.520" end="00:19:53.960" style="s2">translated as wisdom and we&#39;ve lost this</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.590" end="00:19:55.340" style="s2">right in our translations as we</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.960" end="00:19:59.510" style="s2">translate them both by the same word</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.340" end="00:20:00.400" style="s2">they had phronesis and phronesis was the</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.510" end="00:20:02.590" style="s2">ability</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.400" end="00:20:06.940" style="s2">to fit yourself well to a particular</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.590" end="00:20:08.920" style="s2">situation right so Sofia is the morning</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.940" end="00:20:11.350" style="s2">and you see what I&#39;m doing here it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.920" end="00:20:13.840" style="s2">ability to pick up and resonate with the</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.350" end="00:20:18.420" style="s2">more nests phronesis is the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.840" end="00:20:18.420" style="s2">pick up and resonate with the suchness</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.600" end="00:20:25.950" style="s2">very small and the very big well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.060" end="00:20:28.570" style="s2">the it&#39;s the most intimate and the most</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.950" end="00:20:31.360" style="s2">comprehensive okay yeah so then the</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.570" end="00:20:34.780" style="s2">House of M is so help me a spousal the</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.360" end="00:20:36.640" style="s2">espousal of particular virtue in fitness</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.780" end="00:20:38.950" style="s2">to a particular situation is precisely</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.640" end="00:20:41.050" style="s2">the furnaces dimension of wisdom that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.950" end="00:20:43.930" style="s2">right right but it Ignace the fitting</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.050" end="00:20:45.750" style="s2">nests of that&#39;s right but the picking up</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.930" end="00:20:49.960" style="s2">on how there&#39;s always so much more</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.750" end="00:20:51.670" style="s2">behind any aspect of wisdom right that</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.960" end="00:20:54.310" style="s2">there&#39;s so much more to being kind that</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.670" end="00:20:57.610" style="s2">what then what just happened here that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.310" end="00:21:00.130" style="s2">the Sophia because the kindness that I</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.610" end="00:21:02.410" style="s2">show towards Andrew is not the kindness</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.130" end="00:21:04.600" style="s2">that I show towards my son and it is not</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.410" end="00:21:07.120" style="s2">the kindness that I show towards my</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.600" end="00:21:09.940" style="s2">partner or the kindness I show towards</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.120" end="00:21:12.820" style="s2">my student right there&#39;s more to</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.940" end="00:21:15.340" style="s2">kindness but notice that&#39;s the Sophia</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.820" end="00:21:17.020" style="s2">but being kind to Andrew in the right</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.340" end="00:21:18.280" style="s2">way as distinct from how I&#39;m kind</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.020" end="00:21:20.590" style="s2">dispenser right</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.280" end="00:21:21.430" style="s2">that&#39;s the phronesis did that work did</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.590" end="00:21:24.820" style="s2">that make sense</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.430" end="00:21:28.630" style="s2">mm-hmm absolutely okay so now I can put</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.820" end="00:21:33.670" style="s2">these two together virtue is the beauty</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.630" end="00:21:35.620" style="s2">of wisdom because Verte beauty is to get</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.670" end="00:21:38.700" style="s2">the more nests it&#39;s a sweet spot between</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.620" end="00:21:42.010" style="s2">the more nests and the suchness and</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.700" end="00:21:43.990" style="s2">wisdom right is virtue is where you</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.010" end="00:21:47.560" style="s2">bring the more nests into the suchness</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.990" end="00:21:53.380" style="s2">that&#39;s what virtue is so virtue is the</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.560" end="00:21:55.570" style="s2">beauty of wisdom virtue as this is why</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.380" end="00:21:58.240" style="s2">Plato says you start first by looking at</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.570" end="00:21:59.980" style="s2">the beauty of physical things and then</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.240" end="00:22:01.540" style="s2">what the physical things in have in</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.980" end="00:22:03.250" style="s2">common and then he moves this move which</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.540" end="00:22:05.500" style="s2">many people of thumb is serious for the</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.250" end="00:22:09.160" style="s2">Endo&#39;s to say then you consider the</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.500" end="00:22:11.380" style="s2">beauty of virtue that&#39;s because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.160" end="00:22:13.090" style="s2">the move that gets you in that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.380" end="00:22:15.820" style="s2">best the form of beauty that is</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.090" end="00:22:17.890" style="s2">particular to wisdom and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.820" end="00:22:20.650" style="s2">beautification this is the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.890" end="00:22:24.070" style="s2">beauty that we&#39;re trying to make right</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.650" end="00:22:26.320" style="s2">in dialectic okay so that&#39;s the third</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.070" end="00:22:28.360" style="s2">proposal that virtue is the beauty of</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.320" end="00:22:31.210" style="s2">wisdom so this leads me to the fourth</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.360" end="00:22:33.580" style="s2">proposal and you see how this is so this</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.210" end="00:22:35.470" style="s2">is right that this is also an instalment</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.580" end="00:22:38.650" style="s2">process and ER this is a simile Gnaeus</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.470" end="00:22:41.280" style="s2">ly right because virtue virtue it is</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.650" end="00:22:45.750" style="s2">again that process of mediating</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.280" end="00:22:48.790" style="s2">appropriately between war and the sons</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.750" end="00:22:52.090" style="s2">okay so dialectic here&#39;s the proposal</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.790" end="00:22:53.560" style="s2">the fourth proposal notice how this is</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.090" end="00:22:55.840" style="s2">not a strictly logically coherent</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.560" end="00:22:57.400" style="s2">argument it&#39;s an argument but it&#39;s at</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.840" end="00:22:59.020" style="s2">logos argument on gathering things</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.400" end="00:23:02.230" style="s2">together and then gathering together and</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.020" end="00:23:04.600" style="s2">gathering together right dialectic is</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.230" end="00:23:08.740" style="s2">the beautification of thought in speech</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.600" end="00:23:12.700" style="s2">in order to conform to virtue and this</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.740" end="00:23:14.110" style="s2">is how we practice wisdom so dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.700" end="00:23:16.120" style="s2">is the beautification of thought and</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.110" end="00:23:18.520" style="s2">speech in order to conform to virtue and</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.120" end="00:23:20.860" style="s2">this is how we practice and wisdom what</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.520" end="00:23:24.520" style="s2">does this imply dialectic is about</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.860" end="00:23:26.830" style="s2">virtue in two senses virtue is always</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.520" end="00:23:29.320" style="s2">the topic of every dialectic and it is</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.830" end="00:23:31.780" style="s2">every dialogue is about a virtue and it</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.320" end="00:23:33.820" style="s2">is look the topic and it is the enacted</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.780" end="00:23:36.190" style="s2">tonus we are supposed to be talking</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.820" end="00:23:38.500" style="s2">about courage in a dialogue but we are</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.190" end="00:23:41.460" style="s2">also supposed to be enacting courage and</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.500" end="00:23:45.010" style="s2">Socrates always exemplifies that in fact</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.460" end="00:23:48.220" style="s2">the enactment of courage takes precedent</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.010" end="00:23:50.650" style="s2">over right the topic anything that is</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.220" end="00:23:52.690" style="s2">spoken about courage the speaking and</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.650" end="00:23:54.700" style="s2">the enactment right the topic and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.690" end="00:23:58.990" style="s2">tono&#39;s are wedded together because the</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.700" end="00:24:02.350" style="s2">ultimate goal is to conform to virtue to</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.990" end="00:24:04.450" style="s2">love the beauty of wisdom so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.350" end="00:24:06.280" style="s2">those are the four proposals okay I have</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.450" end="00:24:09.910" style="s2">one question about the word virtue</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.280" end="00:24:12.790" style="s2">because it seems to be a word that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.910" end="00:24:15.580" style="s2">been kind of abused and has a moralistic</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.790" end="00:24:18.370" style="s2">tone to it yeah that&#39;s actually a bigger</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.580" end="00:24:20.820" style="s2">word than that it&#39;s it&#39;s a more virtuous</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.370" end="00:24:22.350" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean being</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.820" end="00:24:24.809" style="s2">two shoes or something you know it</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.350" end="00:24:26.399" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean just being good no no not</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.809" end="00:24:28.950" style="s2">at all I&#39;m more to it than that so I</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.399" end="00:24:31.019" style="s2">think maybe we should unpackage define</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.950" end="00:24:33.149" style="s2">and we should reinvent virtue as well</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.019" end="00:24:34.500" style="s2">right what that mules let&#39;s let&#39;s pick</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.149" end="00:24:36.570" style="s2">up on something that everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.500" end="00:24:39.299" style="s2">familiar with virtual reality the</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.570" end="00:24:41.580" style="s2">virtual world why do we use that term</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.299" end="00:24:45.509" style="s2">because the remote the meaning of virtue</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.580" end="00:24:48.360" style="s2">is actually a power right it&#39;s a power</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.509" end="00:24:50.700" style="s2">in act it&#39;s a it&#39;s a potential it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.360" end="00:24:53.190" style="s2">just mere possibility it&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.700" end="00:24:55.919" style="s2">living potential that&#39;s being enacted</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.190" end="00:24:58.919" style="s2">right it&#39;s being actualized so the</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.919" end="00:25:01.860" style="s2">virtue of honesty is to have the</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.919" end="00:25:04.440" style="s2">potential the set of skills sensibility</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.860" end="00:25:06.450" style="s2">and sense of self that when it comes</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.440" end="00:25:10.610" style="s2">into a particular situation will be</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.450" end="00:25:15.179" style="s2">actualized as courage or actualized as</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.610" end="00:25:18.990" style="s2">honesty that&#39;s what a virtue means which</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.179" end="00:25:21.360" style="s2">explains why the virtues are associated</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.990" end="00:25:23.490" style="s2">with the Platonic forms because of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.360" end="00:25:26.700" style="s2">tonic forms are these exponent powers of</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.490" end="00:25:29.340" style="s2">knowing then the expression knowing in</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.700" end="00:25:29.850" style="s2">virtue yes all of a sudden makes a whole</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.340" end="00:25:32.100" style="s2">lot of sense</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.850" end="00:25:34.139" style="s2">exactly and notice that we do that we</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.100" end="00:25:39.659" style="s2">we&#39;re knowing in virtue of we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.139" end="00:25:41.159" style="s2">this in virtue of exactly exactly so</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.659" end="00:25:43.139" style="s2">what I what I&#39;m trying to do in Andrew</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.159" end="00:25:45.840" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to do the I&#39;m trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.139" end="00:25:47.789" style="s2">this thing and I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.840" end="00:25:48.990" style="s2">succeeding or not it&#39;s like an open but</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.789" end="00:25:51.809" style="s2">you see what I&#39;m trying instead of just</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.990" end="00:25:53.820" style="s2">giving you you know sentences about your</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.809" end="00:25:55.230" style="s2">particular question I&#39;m trying to logo&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.820" end="00:25:56.820" style="s2">them together I&#39;m trying to bring them</p>

<p begin="00:26:08.700" end="00:26:12.450" style="s2">well when you were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.259" end="00:26:16.320" style="s2">potential and relating that to virtue I</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.450" end="00:26:18.980" style="s2">was thinking about soul again yeah and I</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.320" end="00:26:18.980" style="s2">was thinking that</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.150" end="00:26:23.920" style="s2">the soul is kind of an echo of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.100" end="00:26:27.610" style="s2">future of your future potential of the</p>

<p begin="00:26:38.200" end="00:26:41.800" style="s2">become like so the morning is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.210" end="00:26:44.350" style="s2">mystery of participation it&#39;s how we</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.800" end="00:26:46.450" style="s2">unfold into being but the suchness is</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.350" end="00:26:48.490" style="s2">the mystery of our individuation how we</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.450" end="00:26:50.260" style="s2">become what we particularly are what we</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.490" end="00:26:52.270" style="s2">individually are and Tillich&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.260" end="00:26:54.040" style="s2">insight right is that that&#39;s that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.270" end="00:26:56.740" style="s2">that&#39;s the fundamental grammar the</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.040" end="00:26:58.900" style="s2">fundamental tonus of human existence</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.740" end="00:27:02.350" style="s2">we&#39;re always in tension between</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.900" end="00:27:07.300" style="s2">individuation and participation and</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.350" end="00:27:11.160" style="s2">beauty is a way in which we enact a and</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.300" end="00:27:14.290" style="s2">become virtuous within that tension</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.160" end="00:27:16.390" style="s2">within that tension hmm so sorry</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.290" end="00:27:18.970" style="s2">actually argues in her book not that</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.390" end="00:27:20.860" style="s2">beauty is truth or goodness</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.970" end="00:27:22.360" style="s2">she says that beauty and this is one of</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.860" end="00:27:24.309" style="s2">her core arguments and inspired what I</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.360" end="00:27:26.500" style="s2">was staying here the beauty is basically</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.309" end="00:27:29.200" style="s2">where we practice being just and we</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.500" end="00:27:32.230" style="s2">practice looking for the truth we</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.200" end="00:27:34.390" style="s2">practice the show we Pro what she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.230" end="00:27:36.910" style="s2">basically saying is beauty is where we</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.390" end="00:27:39.790" style="s2">practice the kind of seeing and being</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.910" end="00:27:43.870" style="s2">and talking and thinking that prepares</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.790" end="00:27:46.090" style="s2">us for for you know moral virtues like</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.870" end="00:27:47.800" style="s2">honesty or bling which is perhaps also</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.090" end="00:27:50.770" style="s2">an intellectual virtue and also</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.800" end="00:27:52.450" style="s2">intellectual virtues like you know you</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.770" end="00:27:54.670" style="s2">know wisdom and things like that it</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.450" end="00:27:57.010" style="s2">prepares us for both of those it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.670" end="00:27:58.960" style="s2">basically the schoolhouse for both the</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.010" end="00:28:00.220" style="s2">intellectual and the moral virtues and</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.960" end="00:28:02.380" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to bring back</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.220" end="00:28:04.330" style="s2">here because I think she&#39;s articulating</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.380" end="00:28:07.030" style="s2">something beautiful that was a central</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.330" end="00:28:08.740" style="s2">idea in Plato I mean that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.030" end="00:28:10.300" style="s2">counterintuitive to how we think of</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.740" end="00:28:12.460" style="s2">beauty we kind of think of beauty as</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.300" end="00:28:15.220" style="s2">something primordial that has nothing to</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.460" end="00:28:18.280" style="s2">do with you know you know any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.220" end="00:28:19.900" style="s2">moral virtues it&#39;s just it&#39;s just it</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.280" end="00:28:22.809" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have moral virtues it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.900" end="00:28:26.440" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s the it&#39;s just a flower it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.809" end="00:28:29.050" style="s2">it&#39;s just bare bare truth that brings up</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.440" end="00:28:31.120" style="s2">Han right that brings up on so notice</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.050" end="00:28:32.110" style="s2">what what Han sang with the aesthetics</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.120" end="00:28:34.330" style="s2">of the smooth</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.110" end="00:28:36.730" style="s2">how he said how we reduced beauty to</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.330" end="00:28:39.549" style="s2">things being smooth right because smooth</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.730" end="00:28:43.330" style="s2">is comforting it challenges us in no way</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.549" end="00:28:45.159" style="s2">no so what but he stand what to use my</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.330" end="00:28:48.039" style="s2">language one of his complaints is</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.159" end="00:28:49.870" style="s2">because he uses alterity he says we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.039" end="00:28:51.309" style="s2">lost the more I&#39;m using my language now</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.870" end="00:28:51.820" style="s2">but I think it&#39;s perfectly consonant</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.309" end="00:28:53.529" style="s2">with it</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.820" end="00:28:56.559" style="s2">we&#39;ve lost the morning so beauty and</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.529" end="00:28:59.620" style="s2">within the payflow also yes</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.559" end="00:29:01.870" style="s2">and so we dismiss smoothness it works</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.620" end="00:29:04.539" style="s2">about Jeff Koons and his like balloon</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.870" end="00:29:06.519" style="s2">his balloon dogs and they&#39;re all there</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.539" end="00:29:08.830" style="s2">they&#39;re very cute and they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.519" end="00:29:10.809" style="s2">colorful and but there&#39;s obviously</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.830" end="00:29:13.330" style="s2">they&#39;re not like a Rodin they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.809" end="00:29:15.190" style="s2">that gravity right no there&#39;s no they</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.330" end="00:29:17.649" style="s2">don&#39;t have this like intense gravity</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.190" end="00:29:19.480" style="s2">that that that the beauty also has like</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.649" end="00:29:22.120" style="s2">it does pull you</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.480" end="00:29:26.409" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t just send you off into bliss</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.120" end="00:29:30.279" style="s2">it also brings you into into the earth</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.409" end="00:29:32.309" style="s2">as well I think that&#39;s exactly right so</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.279" end="00:29:34.960" style="s2">what I was picking up on and horn is</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.309" end="00:29:38.230" style="s2">smoothness I mean think about like the</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.960" end="00:29:40.480" style="s2">smoothness of caress so smoothness marks</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.230" end="00:29:42.490" style="s2">out a kind of intimacy but it&#39;s intimacy</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.480" end="00:29:44.950" style="s2">without challenge it&#39;s an intimacy and</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.490" end="00:29:47.260" style="s2">this is Hans point it is deadening right</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.950" end="00:29:50.769" style="s2">it&#39;s deadening because they&#39;re the the</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.260" end="00:29:52.210" style="s2">way in which beauty right a finds the</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.769" end="00:29:55.210" style="s2">suchness and the mourners to each other</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.210" end="00:29:57.220" style="s2">the educational aspect he deuce to draw</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.210" end="00:29:59.679" style="s2">out that&#39;s being left out of beauty</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.220" end="00:30:02.139" style="s2">that&#39;s Hans main completed beauty as a</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.679" end="00:30:04.210" style="s2">veil it&#39;s not a it&#39;s not a it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.139" end="00:30:06.340" style="s2">everything being presented to you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.210" end="00:30:08.740" style="s2">always behind a veil that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.340" end="00:30:10.440" style="s2">because it&#39;s always got mourners to it</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.740" end="00:30:14.080" style="s2">think about the veil again the veil</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.440" end="00:30:16.510" style="s2">again it connotes an intimacy but it</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.080" end="00:30:18.130" style="s2">also right there&#39;s a beyond this right</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.510" end="00:30:20.019" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a way in which it has</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.130" end="00:30:22.000" style="s2">the mortise it recedes from you and it</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.019" end="00:30:24.220" style="s2">challenges you it draws you forth it</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.000" end="00:30:26.440" style="s2">puts a demand on you every disclosure</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.220" end="00:30:28.450" style="s2">from it puts a demand on you to go</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.440" end="00:30:30.610" style="s2">through transformation to keep in</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.450" end="00:30:32.679" style="s2">conformity with what has been disclosed</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.610" end="00:30:34.750" style="s2">and that&#39;s the training for virtue</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.679" end="00:30:38.049" style="s2">that&#39;s the training for truth that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.750" end="00:30:41.260" style="s2">training for goodness beauty and beauty</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.049" end="00:30:43.090" style="s2">is what actually trains us it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.260" end="00:30:46.269" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s the common educational</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.090" end="00:30:48.999" style="s2">ancestor of the pursuit of truth</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.269" end="00:30:52.809" style="s2">and the pursuit of goodness yeah he also</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.999" end="00:30:54.339" style="s2">said Han that within the smooth right we</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.809" end="00:30:56.739" style="s2">don&#39;t even have a notion of ugliness</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.339" end="00:30:59.679" style="s2">anymore that&#39;s right there&#39;s no gravity</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.739" end="00:31:01.869" style="s2">to ugliness either so and it occurred to</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.679" end="00:31:04.809" style="s2">me that in order to understand beauty</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.869" end="00:31:06.429" style="s2">right we also have to understand you</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.809" end="00:31:08.679" style="s2">know the ugliness of our world you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.429" end="00:31:11.049" style="s2">our the ugliness of when we depart from</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.679" end="00:31:14.440" style="s2">beauty like we need that contrast we</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.049" end="00:31:16.779" style="s2">need that dialectic we can&#39;t just you</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.440" end="00:31:18.940" style="s2">know again this is we this is why you</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.779" end="00:31:21.369" style="s2">probably mentioned horror you know in</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.940" end="00:31:25.629" style="s2">some sense because there&#39;s there there</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.369" end="00:31:29.619" style="s2">is there&#39;s beauty is is is tearing you</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.629" end="00:31:31.869" style="s2">to pieces on some level maybe it&#39;s taken</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.619" end="00:31:34.149" style="s2">too far right I and that&#39;s what Rilke</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.869" end="00:31:36.159" style="s2">said right and I think what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.149" end="00:31:38.320" style="s2">pointing to Andrew and then I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.159" end="00:31:39.549" style="s2">shut up so Chris can talk but what I</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.320" end="00:31:41.709" style="s2">think what you&#39;re pointing to is what</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.549" end="00:31:43.149" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to argue for notice that when</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.709" end="00:31:46.089" style="s2">you when you started bringing in and you</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.149" end="00:31:48.309" style="s2">if you and this is what I think Holly is</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.089" end="00:31:49.989" style="s2">doing when you want to bring in that</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.309" end="00:31:51.279" style="s2">contrast and you want to enhance it</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.989" end="00:31:53.649" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about a normativity</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.279" end="00:31:55.269" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about judgments of</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.649" end="00:31:57.940" style="s2">there&#39;s something deeply wrong with</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.269" end="00:32:00.249" style="s2">ugliness there&#39;s something contrast of</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.940" end="00:32:02.169" style="s2">ly deeply right and I think the only way</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.249" end="00:32:04.479" style="s2">we can do that without props falling</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.169" end="00:32:07.409" style="s2">into the sealed definitions is to</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.479" end="00:32:10.659" style="s2">realign beauty with virtue again</p>

<p begin="00:32:16.029" end="00:32:21.039" style="s2">say mmm-hmm that&#39;s gives it back its</p>

<p begin="00:32:21.039" end="00:32:29.169" style="s2">I think in order for that to to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.019" end="00:32:32.559" style="s2">possible that that particular reinvent</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.169" end="00:32:34.479" style="s2">EO of beauty it has to be understood it</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.559" end="00:32:37.299" style="s2">has to be understood transitively it</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.479" end="00:32:39.839" style="s2">can&#39;t be it has to be a property of the</p>

<p begin="00:32:39.839" end="00:32:45.549" style="s2">that presents as an object of the world</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.839" end="00:32:51.029" style="s2">right because you know much of what we</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.549" end="00:32:54.339" style="s2">consider to be ugly on its face can be</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.029" end="00:32:56.379" style="s2">pronounced beautifully within the right</p>

<p begin="00:32:59.920" end="00:33:04.150" style="s2">in detail the ugliness can be bared</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.380" end="00:33:06.400" style="s2">beautiful you can see beauty and decay</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.150" end="00:33:09.870" style="s2">for example absolutely you can see</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.400" end="00:33:13.660" style="s2">beauty in the an absolute squalor and</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.870" end="00:33:17.170" style="s2">but but in that case beauty beauty is</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.660" end="00:33:24.010" style="s2">the affinity of your particular relation</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.170" end="00:33:25.870" style="s2">to the your your like I mean I mean that</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.010" end="00:33:29.440" style="s2">that&#39;s why that&#39;s why beauty emerges so</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.870" end="00:33:32.470" style="s2">so naturally within dialog because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.440" end="00:33:34.900" style="s2">a it&#39;s a it&#39;s an affined property of the</p>

<p begin="00:33:38.080" end="00:33:42.940" style="s2">persons so it is between so it is</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.750" end="00:33:44.410" style="s2">perceptually right in terms of your</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.940" end="00:33:46.420" style="s2">relationship with your being in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.410" end="00:33:48.430" style="s2">world itself it&#39;s a property of that</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.420" end="00:33:49.330" style="s2">relation that you strike well I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.430" end="00:33:51.100" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly right</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.330" end="00:33:52.630" style="s2">and I was trying to port n that when I</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.100" end="00:33:54.160" style="s2">was talking about it as meta optimal</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.630" end="00:33:55.780" style="s2">grip and I&#39;m alluding back to the</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.160" end="00:33:58.180" style="s2">previous discussion the three of us had</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.780" end="00:34:01.810" style="s2">about soul as the Faculty of faith where</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.180" end="00:34:03.550" style="s2">faith isn&#39;t any closure right faith is</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.810" end="00:34:05.740" style="s2">actually maintaining right relationship</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.550" end="00:34:08.310" style="s2">through change and I say that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.740" end="00:34:11.110" style="s2">trying to say beauty is it is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.310" end="00:34:13.120" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a faithful right relationship</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.110" end="00:34:15.280" style="s2">it&#39;s transductive between you it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.120" end="00:34:17.679" style="s2">in the eye of the beholder nor is it in</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.280" end="00:34:19.960" style="s2">the object but it&#39;s it&#39;s is your</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.679" end="00:34:22.419" style="s2">relationship to the world a virtuous one</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.960" end="00:34:24.070" style="s2">or a vicious one that&#39;s right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.419" end="00:34:26.200" style="s2">right it has to do with your mind too</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.070" end="00:34:27.940" style="s2">renewing when you brought faith in I</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.200" end="00:34:31.620" style="s2">thought it&#39;s it&#39;s renewing your vows</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.940" end="00:34:34.600" style="s2">constantly it&#39;s renew yes yes yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.620" end="00:34:37.090" style="s2">it&#39;s exactly that it&#39;s I mean we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.600" end="00:34:39.100" style="s2">exemplifying it here the reinvent yo is</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.090" end="00:34:41.169" style="s2">that renewing because we&#39;re constantly</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.100" end="00:34:44.169" style="s2">trying to breathe new life into these</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.169" end="00:34:46.120" style="s2">terms so that we can do exactly what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.169" end="00:34:49.300" style="s2">talking about here exactly that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.120" end="00:34:50.800" style="s2">great mm-hmm that&#39;s right that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.300" end="00:34:53.350" style="s2">there&#39;s no the logos cannot gain</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.800" end="00:34:55.240" style="s2">traction cannot gain any traction in</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.350" end="00:34:58.200" style="s2">realism without beauty for that very</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.240" end="00:35:01.180" style="s2">reason so it&#39;s really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.200" end="00:35:04.180" style="s2">because when I was doing the workshop</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.180" end="00:35:06.130" style="s2">with people well because what so what</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.180" end="00:35:08.650" style="s2">what I when it came to me Chris it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.130" end="00:35:10.500" style="s2">practical consequence of this because</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.650" end="00:35:11.670" style="s2">I&#39;d always wondered and you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.500" end="00:35:13.410" style="s2">one furred and others have made sir this</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.670" end="00:35:15.090" style="s2">weird thing about Socrates always</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.410" end="00:35:16.740" style="s2">wondered why the dialogues always figure</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.090" end="00:35:18.720" style="s2">on virtues either moral virtues or</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.740" end="00:35:21.390" style="s2">intellectual virtues and then I realized</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.720" end="00:35:24.330" style="s2">that&#39;s not happenstance that is not</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.390" end="00:35:27.540" style="s2">happenstance the deal logos has to</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.330" end="00:35:29.670" style="s2">always be about the topic of virtue and</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.540" end="00:35:31.620" style="s2">it always has to be the enacted tonus of</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.670" end="00:35:33.270" style="s2">virtue though that that is not</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.620" end="00:35:35.580" style="s2">happenstance that&#39;s how you get the</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.270" end="00:35:38.700" style="s2">metonymy what you&#39;re talking about is</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.580" end="00:35:40.710" style="s2">actually right metonymically related to</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.700" end="00:35:42.300" style="s2">what you&#39;re actually enacting that that</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.710" end="00:35:44.940" style="s2">is not a coincidence in this it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.300" end="00:35:46.530" style="s2">necessity of the very constitution of</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.940" end="00:35:50.220" style="s2">dialectic we have to be talking about</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.530" end="00:35:52.140" style="s2">virtue as we enact it as we and we and</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.220" end="00:35:54.630" style="s2">we resonate between there&#39;s no other way</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.140" end="00:35:55.800" style="s2">right in order in order for the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.630" end="00:35:57.480" style="s2">and the meta meaning to be properly</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.800" end="00:35:58.650" style="s2">affined into relation in order to in</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.480" end="00:36:00.030" style="s2">order for the in order for the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.650" end="00:36:02.010" style="s2">of the logos to become conversant with</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.030" end="00:36:03.780" style="s2">the meaning of the logos the higher</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.010" end="00:36:06.510" style="s2">order meaning of the logos that gathers</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.780" end="00:36:08.310" style="s2">the entire dialogue it you have to start</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.510" end="00:36:09.930" style="s2">with its you have to start with this</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.310" end="00:36:12.360" style="s2">method emic child in order to then</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.930" end="00:36:12.750" style="s2">aspire to the parent if I can put it</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.360" end="00:36:14.940" style="s2">that way</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.750" end="00:36:16.350" style="s2">no I think that&#39;s right so what has been</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.940" end="00:36:17.520" style="s2">happening with people other people have</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.350" end="00:36:19.050" style="s2">been doing some of these experiments</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.520" end="00:36:20.520" style="s2">about trying to bring argumentation and</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.050" end="00:36:23.310" style="s2">they just bring in a topic like a</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.520" end="00:36:25.980" style="s2">problem and it doesn&#39;t go anywhere but</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.310" end="00:36:28.650" style="s2">when I told people I meant in a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.980" end="00:36:29.790" style="s2">instruction I said no no this is what</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.650" end="00:36:31.800" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna do we&#39;re going to break up</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.790" end="00:36:33.090" style="s2">into groups of four right and then what</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.800" end="00:36:35.400" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna do is you&#39;re gonna do for</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.090" end="00:36:37.080" style="s2">ED you&#39;re gonna choose a virtue and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.400" end="00:36:39.480" style="s2">one person is going to begin by saying</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.080" end="00:36:41.970" style="s2">and I propose let&#39;s say honesty is this</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.480" end="00:36:43.890" style="s2">and the other person is going to amplify</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.970" end="00:36:45.390" style="s2">it they&#39;re gonna say well can you say a</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.890" end="00:36:47.130" style="s2">little bit more or I noticed you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.390" end="00:36:49.560" style="s2">making this gesture they&#39;re gonna try</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.130" end="00:36:51.480" style="s2">and reveal the beauty of how the person</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.560" end="00:36:53.070" style="s2">is enacting it and use that as a as a</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.480" end="00:36:56.340" style="s2">scaffold for getting them to say more</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.070" end="00:36:58.770" style="s2">and more and more and then the second</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.340" end="00:37:01.320" style="s2">person has to come to a place right</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.770" end="00:37:03.120" style="s2">where right the first person sort of</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.320" end="00:37:04.530" style="s2">said I&#39;m done and the second person says</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.120" end="00:37:05.970" style="s2">well this is how this is what I</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.530" end="00:37:07.290" style="s2">understood you to be saying and they</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.970" end="00:37:09.090" style="s2">have to make sure that they understand</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.290" end="00:37:10.770" style="s2">them right they have to hurt the other</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.090" end="00:37:12.210" style="s2">the first person has to be heard and</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.770" end="00:37:14.790" style="s2">then they have to the second person has</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.210" end="00:37:15.840" style="s2">to say what they appreciate about it in</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.790" end="00:37:17.340" style="s2">the not only in the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.840" end="00:37:18.690" style="s2">understanding but what was valuable what</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.340" end="00:37:22.050" style="s2">did they see that they didn&#39;t see before</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.690" end="00:37:25.080" style="s2">and then then they have to say what was</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.050" end="00:37:27.330" style="s2">missing yeah but was mysterious what</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.080" end="00:37:29.160" style="s2">went slightly off and then what they do</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.330" end="00:37:31.650" style="s2">is when they and that they do that and</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.160" end="00:37:33.810" style="s2">they turn to the next person they do</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.650" end="00:37:36.120" style="s2">what was off what was missing and then</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.810" end="00:37:38.580" style="s2">they make their proposal about what</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.120" end="00:37:40.590" style="s2">honesty is and you keep cycling that</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.580" end="00:37:42.900" style="s2">through people and then what you do is</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.590" end="00:37:44.340" style="s2">you get the groups and you bring all the</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.900" end="00:37:46.560" style="s2">groups together and this group is doing</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.340" end="00:37:48.060" style="s2">courage this group is doing honesty and</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.560" end="00:37:53.070" style="s2">you get all the groups and you say okay</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.060" end="00:37:54.690" style="s2">now what is virtue itself and you and</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.070" end="00:37:57.420" style="s2">you know what everybody keeps talking</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.690" end="00:37:59.970" style="s2">about about how how they were amazed by</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.420" end="00:38:02.280" style="s2">how this the topics just exploded and</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.970" end="00:38:04.020" style="s2">they felt deeply engaged because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.280" end="00:38:05.580" style="s2">enacting and then they&#39;re seeing them</p>

<p begin="00:42:29.090" end="00:42:32.270" style="s2">to think about when a poet I mean I read</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.380" end="00:42:34.940" style="s2">poetry right when you win you&#39;re writing</p>

<p begin="00:42:43.400" end="00:42:48.650" style="s2">like that&#39;s what&#39;s happening when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.990" end="00:42:50.270" style="s2">doing poesis and and notice that the</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.650" end="00:42:52.100" style="s2">connection that that&#39;s the connection</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.270" end="00:42:54.250" style="s2">you were intuiting Andrew between the</p>

<p begin="00:42:58.760" end="00:43:04.340" style="s2">of the very same thing mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.180" end="00:43:05.810" style="s2">it also happens not only when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.340" end="00:43:08.840" style="s2">doing when you&#39;re writing poetry but</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.810" end="00:43:09.980" style="s2">when you&#39;re writing dramatically happens</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.840" end="00:43:11.869" style="s2">right because the whole probe the whole</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.980" end="00:43:14.800" style="s2">process of rendering character is</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.869" end="00:43:20.720" style="s2">precisely that you&#39;re giving such a form</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.800" end="00:43:22.700" style="s2">to the two to wait like you&#39;re embodying</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.720" end="00:43:24.500" style="s2">the virtue and in the embodiment of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.700" end="00:43:28.580" style="s2">virtue as such you&#39;re giving it a</p>

<p begin="00:43:32.900" end="00:43:39.830" style="s2">I think emerges as character no that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.890" end="00:43:42.440" style="s2">great yeah that&#39;s so important too we</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.830" end="00:43:44.180" style="s2">really need to bring we need to reinvent</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.440" end="00:43:47.780" style="s2">art as well because we need to bring</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.180" end="00:43:50.840" style="s2">narrative art back in absolutely and it</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.780" end="00:43:52.910" style="s2">is yes that&#39;s how we embody the a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.840" end="00:43:56.060" style="s2">these things that&#39;s how we go to the</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.910" end="00:43:58.430" style="s2">next next level perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.060" end="00:43:59.960" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s one form of gathering the</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.430" end="00:44:01.870" style="s2">logos right gathering the logos is</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.960" end="00:44:03.980" style="s2">precisely the process of dramatic</p>

<p begin="00:44:09.680" end="00:44:14.870" style="s2">deep forms of characterization are</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.350" end="00:44:17.450" style="s2">justly celebrated because they disclose</p>

<p begin="00:44:38.720" end="00:44:42.980" style="s2">of virtue and characterization and drama</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.450" end="00:44:44.660" style="s2">that&#39;s brilliant Chris I hadn&#39;t thought</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.980" end="00:44:46.490" style="s2">about that that&#39;s exactly right</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.660" end="00:44:47.810" style="s2">you know that Keith Utley he&#39;s a he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.490" end="00:44:49.190" style="s2">one of my colleagues at the University</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.810" end="00:44:51.800" style="s2">of Toronto has all this research showing</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.190" end="00:44:54.410" style="s2">that you know working with drama working</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.800" end="00:44:56.350" style="s2">with literature is our primary way of</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.410" end="00:45:00.320" style="s2">training ourselves to be more virtuous</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.350" end="00:45:02.840" style="s2">absolutely yeah yeah which also means it</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.320" end="00:45:06.460" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean again I&#39;m trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.840" end="00:45:10.130" style="s2">away from this sentimental idea of verse</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.460" end="00:45:12.620" style="s2">because because in draw drama is usually</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.130" end="00:45:15.200" style="s2">about going into the human darkness</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.620" end="00:45:17.510" style="s2">right going into the horrors right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.200" end="00:45:21.290" style="s2">often that way I mean a tragedy is that</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.510" end="00:45:23.360" style="s2">right in any case you know Kurtz goes</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.290" end="00:45:27.440" style="s2">into the the EC&#39;s the horror the horror</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.360" end="00:45:30.380" style="s2">and that&#39;s what Marvel&#39;s so there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.440" end="00:45:33.290" style="s2">it&#39;s not just beauty as as some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.380" end="00:45:37.000" style="s2">really terrible sort of like sentimental</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.290" end="00:45:39.380" style="s2">version of reality it&#39;s something else</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.000" end="00:45:42.140" style="s2">but look at what I always want to bring</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.380" end="00:45:44.180" style="s2">gravity to these concepts when we talk</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.140" end="00:45:47.330" style="s2">about them because because they have</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.180" end="00:45:52.040" style="s2">become because you know if it becomes so</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.330" end="00:45:55.760" style="s2">Disneyland yeah yeah where virtue is the</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.040" end="00:45:58.610" style="s2">power to lead a good life in all the</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.760" end="00:46:00.620" style="s2">dimensions of goodness that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.610" end="00:46:03.530" style="s2">virtue is it doesn&#39;t mean the moralistic</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.620" end="00:46:07.100" style="s2">you know think of following rules right</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.530" end="00:46:09.050" style="s2">I&#39;m thinking of you know I want to live</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.100" end="00:46:09.530" style="s2">the kind of life that Socrates led or</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.050" end="00:46:12.170" style="s2">the boot</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.530" end="00:46:15.170" style="s2">or Jesus of Nazareth LED and that can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.170" end="00:46:17.000" style="s2">be captured or reduced to following this</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.170" end="00:46:18.710" style="s2">rule or that ruler or this rule well</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.000" end="00:46:20.840" style="s2">it&#39;s an adventure isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.710" end="00:46:23.750" style="s2">it&#39;s an adventure to look out to look</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.840" end="00:46:25.280" style="s2">beyond right and and think about Marlowe</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.750" end="00:46:27.350" style="s2">in the heart of darkness and think about</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.280" end="00:46:29.180" style="s2">the beauty of Conrad&#39;s prose I know the</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.350" end="00:46:32.360" style="s2">heart of darkness is contentious because</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.180" end="00:46:34.490" style="s2">of colonialism racism I&#39;m gonna put that</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.360" end="00:46:36.350" style="s2">aside because that&#39;s another thing to</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.490" end="00:46:38.630" style="s2">talk about but in I mean think about</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.350" end="00:46:41.480" style="s2">what Marlowe represents Marlowe</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.630" end="00:46:43.370" style="s2">represents virtue in the face right of</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.480" end="00:46:45.290" style="s2">this he because he practices</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.370" end="00:46:47.030" style="s2">self-restraint and he that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.290" end="00:46:49.250" style="s2">reducible to any sort of fruit you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.030" end="00:46:51.500" style="s2">he&#39;s not a prude he&#39;s not just adopting</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.250" end="00:46:54.230" style="s2">you know a moralistic set of rules he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.500" end="00:46:56.570" style="s2">constantly continuing the journey he</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.230" end="00:46:59.570" style="s2">keeps good faith in that sense with</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.570" end="00:47:02.930" style="s2">Kurtz but he he dedicates himself to</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.570" end="00:47:04.550" style="s2">remaining right true to his humanity he</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.930" end="00:47:06.800" style="s2">practices he keeps talking about</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.550" end="00:47:10.010" style="s2">self-restraint he doesn&#39;t get swallowed</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.800" end="00:47:12.950" style="s2">by by the horrors but but he doesn&#39;t he</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.010" end="00:47:16.130" style="s2">doesn&#39;t avert his gaze either I remember</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.950" end="00:47:19.250" style="s2">like what was it Kurosawa when he was a</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.130" end="00:47:20.420" style="s2">kid he walked through Tokyo after the</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.250" end="00:47:23.270" style="s2">earthquake and there were corpses</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.420" end="00:47:25.210" style="s2">everywhere and his brother said his</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.270" end="00:47:29.240" style="s2">brother said look look you have to look</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.210" end="00:47:35.080" style="s2">because because you know you know the</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.240" end="00:47:35.080" style="s2">poet doesn&#39;t avert his eyes or yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.590" end="00:47:40.610" style="s2">Marlow I think Marlow finds the sweet</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.330" end="00:47:45.350" style="s2">spot I thought I&#39;m talking about mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.610" end="00:47:46.850" style="s2">he&#39;s he but he&#39;s also but he&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.350" end="00:47:48.860" style="s2">self-restraint as he maintains that</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.850" end="00:47:51.980" style="s2">intimacy with himself he made he does</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.860" end="00:47:54.350" style="s2">his sickness and he maintains those two</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.980" end="00:47:58.880" style="s2">and that is what actually affords him</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.350" end="00:48:02.200" style="s2">going on the journey the quest and and</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.880" end="00:48:05.470" style="s2">and how does he like one of the ways</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.200" end="00:48:07.670" style="s2">formally in which he does all of that is</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.470" end="00:48:12.440" style="s2">think about the form of the novella</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.670" end="00:48:18.040" style="s2">itself laying the story to a chorus of</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.440" end="00:48:20.210" style="s2">of onlookers bearing witness to the very</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.040" end="00:48:22.250" style="s2">to the very character that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.210" end="00:48:22.940" style="s2">conveying right that&#39;s a story within a</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.250" end="00:48:24.890" style="s2">story</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.940" end="00:48:28.609" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s why that particular device</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.890" end="00:48:29.750" style="s2">the in framing of the story with its I</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.609" end="00:48:31.280" style="s2">mean we were talking in our last</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.750" end="00:48:32.839" style="s2">conversation together we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.280" end="00:48:36.200" style="s2">about the function of the heavenly host</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.839" end="00:48:39.490" style="s2">to the choral function of the the the</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.200" end="00:48:43.819" style="s2">the morning of the choral function of of</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.490" end="00:48:46.700" style="s2">witnessing transcendently without being</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.819" end="00:48:48.289" style="s2">enclosed by the the perspective of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.700" end="00:48:51.079" style="s2">character that&#39;s playing through and</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.289" end="00:48:53.720" style="s2">that and that the way that the novellas</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.079" end="00:48:56.390" style="s2">structured lends that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.720" end="00:48:59.900" style="s2">higher-order perspective that sees the</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.390" end="00:49:01.910" style="s2">narrative in virtue of its possibility</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.900" end="00:49:04.520" style="s2">of its possible implications of its</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.910" end="00:49:06.710" style="s2">possible meaning beyond its meaning</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.520" end="00:49:09.200" style="s2">because he relays the story to the</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.710" end="00:49:10.520" style="s2">people on the boat right and they&#39;re and</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.200" end="00:49:12.109" style="s2">they&#39;re not saying anything they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.520" end="00:49:14.660" style="s2">being they&#39;re silent but there&#39;s they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.109" end="00:49:17.119" style="s2">bearing silent witness to the very</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.660" end="00:49:18.770" style="s2">dynamic that he&#39;s exemplified and so is</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.119" end="00:49:21.020" style="s2">the reader because the story starts</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.770" end="00:49:23.150" style="s2">reading personal narrator and then takes</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.020" end="00:49:24.589" style="s2">you into that yeah that&#39;s right there is</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.150" end="00:49:26.569" style="s2">it all the playing with that framing</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.589" end="00:49:29.000" style="s2">that&#39;s really good that&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.569" end="00:49:30.859" style="s2">observation Chris but well I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.000" end="00:49:34.930" style="s2">tips to your point and you to and you</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.859" end="00:49:37.250" style="s2">it&#39;s like that there&#39;s a reason why and</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.930" end="00:49:40.910" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a reason why there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.250" end="00:49:43.160" style="s2">such sublimity to that and similar</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.910" end="00:49:46.130" style="s2">narratives it&#39;s it&#39;s precise and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.160" end="00:49:48.349" style="s2">precisely there inexhaustibility right</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.130" end="00:49:53.210" style="s2">that that the way in which they enact</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.349" end="00:49:57.260" style="s2">that the the narrative as such in acts</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.210" end="00:49:58.789" style="s2">patterns that intimate the morning the</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.260" end="00:50:00.200" style="s2">narrative as such and then that more</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.789" end="00:50:02.630" style="s2">nests beyond the narrative as such is</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.200" end="00:50:04.549" style="s2">precisely what is enclosed and borne out</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.630" end="00:50:07.309" style="s2">by the witnessing presence that</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.549" end="00:50:09.730" style="s2">surrounds it both the reader and perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.309" end="00:50:13.400" style="s2">the ancillary characters and onlookers</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.730" end="00:50:15.020" style="s2">and that&#39;s why right Conrad has Marlow</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.400" end="00:50:17.900" style="s2">and he&#39;s closely says that that the</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.020" end="00:50:21.559" style="s2">Marlow is sitting there like a Buddha at</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.900" end="00:50:24.890" style="s2">the end right oh that&#39;s that&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.559" end="00:50:29.150" style="s2">dark too by the way the dark well yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.890" end="00:50:30.819" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah I guess</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.150" end="00:50:36.740" style="s2">there&#39;s the scene where the Buddha meets</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.819" end="00:50:38.000" style="s2">Mara or something and it is him exactly</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.740" end="00:50:45.020" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.000" end="00:50:47.720" style="s2">you know he&#39;s mmm so Andrew right this</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.020" end="00:50:52.730" style="s2">was my attempt to was not like I say I</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.720" end="00:50:55.460" style="s2">wanted to way of like can we bring when</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.730" end="00:50:58.579" style="s2">somebody is asking us questions can we</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.460" end="00:51:01.010" style="s2">reinvent you argumentation not as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.579" end="00:51:02.359" style="s2">gonna like establish things but what I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:51:02.359" end="00:51:05.270" style="s2">gather a whole bunch of things together</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.559" end="00:51:07.039" style="s2">so they belong together they sing</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.270" end="00:51:09.079" style="s2">together they start to beautify each</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.039" end="00:51:10.970" style="s2">other and then they afford discourse and</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.079" end="00:51:12.049" style="s2">discussion and involvement that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.970" end="00:51:16.039" style="s2">I&#39;m trying that&#39;s why I&#39;m trying to</p>

<p begin="00:51:16.039" end="00:51:19.220" style="s2">making of proposals and the</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.450" end="00:51:20.089" style="s2">consideration of how they fit together</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.220" end="00:51:25.760" style="s2">and belong together</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.089" end="00:51:29.059" style="s2">beyond just logical coherence I was also</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.760" end="00:51:30.470" style="s2">go go ahead Chris um I was just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.059" end="00:51:31.880" style="s2">say it&#39;s interesting because one of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.470" end="00:51:33.589" style="s2">things that happens is when you bring</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.880" end="00:51:35.599" style="s2">you bring these you bring these</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.589" end="00:51:36.079" style="s2">particular definitions in proximity to</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.599" end="00:51:39.920" style="s2">one another</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.079" end="00:51:40.940" style="s2">they okay I&#39;m going to personify them</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.920" end="00:51:42.410" style="s2">for a minute but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.940" end="00:51:46.010" style="s2">inappropriate to given all a discussion</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.410" end="00:51:48.319" style="s2">about character they begin to the</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.010" end="00:51:50.799" style="s2">virtues when they&#39;re brought into within</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.319" end="00:51:56.410" style="s2">range of one another</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.799" end="00:51:58.700" style="s2">allow us to see they allow us to to I</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.410" end="00:52:00.920" style="s2">mean the the the way in which they</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.700" end="00:52:03.140" style="s2">become in conversant is that the virtues</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.920" end="00:52:05.750" style="s2">begin to know in virtue of one another</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.140" end="00:52:09.190" style="s2">yes right so the so so so one virtue</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.750" end="00:52:13.039" style="s2">begins to know in virtue of its of its</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.190" end="00:52:17.000" style="s2">neighboring virtue and is then so in is</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.039" end="00:52:18.589" style="s2">then so articulated its it&#39;s a virtue</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.000" end="00:52:20.029" style="s2">knowing in virtue of another virtue</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.589" end="00:52:21.410" style="s2">which sounds like a mouthful but</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.029" end="00:52:23.390" style="s2">essentially at once you bring these</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.410" end="00:52:24.950" style="s2">things into proximity they begin to know</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.390" end="00:52:27.020" style="s2">by means of one another</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.950" end="00:52:29.210" style="s2">and in being so known by means of one</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.020" end="00:52:33.289" style="s2">another they&#39;re the shared reflections</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.210" end="00:52:36.289" style="s2">of depth begin to appreciate this is a</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.289" end="00:52:38.089" style="s2">point in both the Neoplatonic Western</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.289" end="00:52:40.549" style="s2">tradition and the Buddhist Eastern</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.089" end="00:52:43.040" style="s2">Commission so the addition its indras</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.549" end="00:52:44.900" style="s2">net right yes you mentioned that</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.040" end="00:52:46.010" style="s2">in one here I think I think Andrew you</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.900" end="00:52:49.730" style="s2">mentioned that in one of our previous</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.010" end="00:52:51.440" style="s2">yeah everything is reflected in</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.730" end="00:52:53.840" style="s2">everything anything is reflected faith</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.440" end="00:52:57.380" style="s2">is reflected in soul which is reflected</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.840" end="00:52:59.210" style="s2">in virtue which is reflected right they</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.380" end="00:53:02.540" style="s2">all become eyes unto the world</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.210" end="00:53:04.970" style="s2">yeah the Platonists says right that all</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.540" end="00:53:06.110" style="s2">of the forms are have exactly that</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.970" end="00:53:08.420" style="s2">relationship to each other</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.110" end="00:53:10.790" style="s2">they&#39;re all like indras nets they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.420" end="00:53:12.500" style="s2">reflect and each one captures the</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.790" end="00:53:15.020" style="s2">morning in its own particular suchness</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.500" end="00:53:18.430" style="s2">and but it for right for us it has to</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.020" end="00:53:20.990" style="s2">unfold in time but for in you know for</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.430" end="00:53:24.770" style="s2">Platonists that&#39;s that&#39;s happening sort</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.990" end="00:53:27.880" style="s2">of in eternity and the logos of eternity</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.770" end="00:53:31.130" style="s2">that sort of holographic intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.880" end="00:53:33.290" style="s2">we have to try and capture it in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.130" end="00:53:36.110" style="s2">sequential logos of speech as best we</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.290" end="00:53:38.030" style="s2">can and that&#39;s exactly what so that</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.110" end="00:53:40.160" style="s2">metaphor is exactly the resident</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.030" end="00:53:43.970" style="s2">metaphor the way that virtue speak to me</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.160" end="00:53:47.270" style="s2">Chavez speaks right the ground of</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.970" end="00:53:51.500" style="s2">intelligibility itself which is then</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.270" end="00:53:53.710" style="s2">again echoes with the analogy of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.500" end="00:53:57.260" style="s2">dialogic practice of the two</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.710" end="00:54:00.200" style="s2">conversation partners so as as we as we</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.260" end="00:54:02.600" style="s2">do as we do between ourselves as</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.200" end="00:54:04.460" style="s2">conversation partners so then do the</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.600" end="00:54:07.670" style="s2">virtues in forgive each other</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.460" end="00:54:09.470" style="s2">exactly exactly I like that turn of</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.670" end="00:54:09.890" style="s2">phrase the virtues in virtue of each</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.470" end="00:54:11.600" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.890" end="00:54:14.480" style="s2">that&#39;s beautiful Chris the way you do</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.600" end="00:54:18.620" style="s2">that is so impressive well I&#39;m just I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.480" end="00:54:22.160" style="s2">just riffing off of you riffing is</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.620" end="00:54:24.860" style="s2">exactly the right thing as of this the</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.160" end="00:54:28.940" style="s2">Jazz of this is you know constitutive of</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.860" end="00:54:31.160" style="s2">its beautification it&#39;s not just riffing</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.940" end="00:54:34.340" style="s2">it&#39;s integral to what we&#39;re doing here</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.160" end="00:54:35.900" style="s2">and that was what&#39;s really and when when</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.340" end="00:54:38.480" style="s2">we did the workshop and you got two</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.900" end="00:54:40.280" style="s2">people at the end they were riffing off</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.480" end="00:54:44.540" style="s2">their own particular virtue that they</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.280" end="00:54:46.730" style="s2">discussed courage or honesty but they</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.540" end="00:54:49.460" style="s2">were they were jazzing they were they</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.730" end="00:54:52.040" style="s2">were finding residence and convergence</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.460" end="00:54:53.870" style="s2">right and divergence but in a harmonious</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.040" end="00:54:55.250" style="s2">fashion between each other they were</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.870" end="00:54:56.470" style="s2">doing with the deep learning</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.250" end="00:54:58.090" style="s2">they were converging in</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.470" end="00:55:03.490" style="s2">and converging and varying it was</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.090" end="00:55:06.250" style="s2">beautiful yeah and and sometimes you</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.490" end="00:55:09.730" style="s2">know I like it when some jazz music just</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.250" end="00:55:11.560" style="s2">falls apart psychedelic music are</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.730" end="00:55:13.030" style="s2">sometimes you know what I like I listen</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.560" end="00:55:15.480" style="s2">to these like the Grateful Dead they</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.030" end="00:55:18.130" style="s2">just fall apart and the whole band just</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.480" end="00:55:20.020" style="s2">disassembles itself completely and and</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.130" end="00:55:23.020" style="s2">then they kind of find their way back to</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.020" end="00:55:25.150" style="s2">each other oh yeah I think that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.020" end="00:55:27.640" style="s2">interesting process but the falling</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.150" end="00:55:30.510" style="s2">apart and coming back back together like</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.640" end="00:55:33.400" style="s2">we&#39;re covering for Manipuri a-- yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.510" end="00:55:36.490" style="s2">good and instead of going always for the</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.400" end="00:55:38.920" style="s2">high right yeah music is always like an</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.490" end="00:55:41.500" style="s2">orgasmic trying to be an orgasmic type</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.920" end="00:55:43.960" style="s2">of experience or complete orgasmic bars</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.500" end="00:55:46.200" style="s2">whereas the the jazz is a deeper thing</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.960" end="00:55:49.570" style="s2">because it doesn&#39;t always go for the</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.200" end="00:55:53.170" style="s2">peak right it it falls into the valleys</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.570" end="00:55:55.660" style="s2">in it that&#39;s beautiful you know it did</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.170" end="00:55:57.460" style="s2">it lingers like and that&#39;s another word</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.660" end="00:55:59.590" style="s2">that Hanh uses I think yeah you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.460" end="00:56:01.720" style="s2">lingeringly when it comes to beauty at</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.590" end="00:56:03.400" style="s2">lingers a while and then it just it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.720" end="00:56:05.859" style="s2">lets itself go and then it and then it</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.400" end="00:56:08.080" style="s2">becomes intense again and but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.859" end="00:56:10.480" style="s2">that&#39;s the Emporia is criticality you</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.080" end="00:56:11.950" style="s2">know in self-organizing systems they get</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.480" end="00:56:13.390" style="s2">stuck and what you have to do is you</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.950" end="00:56:15.339" style="s2">have to put you have to lift it</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.390" end="00:56:17.680" style="s2">you have to perturb them you have to</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.339" end="00:56:18.640" style="s2">disturb them yeah they get to a point of</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.680" end="00:56:20.890" style="s2">criticality where they&#39;re almost</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.640" end="00:56:23.260" style="s2">breaking apart falling apart and only</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.890" end="00:56:25.180" style="s2">venture them or something doctor or me a</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.260" end="00:56:31.540" style="s2">puncture is the word that came to mind</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.180" end="00:56:32.440" style="s2">yes yeah well its equilibrium yeah when</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.540" end="00:56:35.080" style="s2">you were when you were describing</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.440" end="00:56:36.940" style="s2">initially John you&#39;re open precis about</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.080" end="00:56:38.740" style="s2">the you know the the equilibrium between</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.940" end="00:56:42.130" style="s2">the suchness and and the more nasai</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.740" end="00:56:43.720" style="s2">think of the the complexify and I knew</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.130" end="00:56:44.950" style="s2">assimilation and the medic and the medic</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.720" end="00:56:46.810" style="s2">combination that you talked about within</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.950" end="00:56:48.700" style="s2">within the cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.810" end="00:56:50.470" style="s2">nomenclature and it sounds like virtue</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.700" end="00:56:52.839" style="s2">and phanzig and maps are more or less</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.470" end="00:56:55.420" style="s2">identical it does I think virtue is very</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.839" end="00:56:57.910" style="s2">much about sort of getting that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.420" end="00:57:00.910" style="s2">it&#39;s a meta optimal grip on right meta</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.910" end="00:57:03.760" style="s2">assimilation and met accommodation right</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.910" end="00:57:05.770" style="s2">totally and that for those of you who</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.760" end="00:57:07.930" style="s2">are watching I mean this is discussed at</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.770" end="00:57:08.670" style="s2">length in some of the videos within my</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.930" end="00:57:10.619" style="s2">within</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.670" end="00:57:11.700" style="s2">awakening from the meeting crisis and in</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.619" end="00:57:14.790" style="s2">some of the stuff that Chris and I have</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.700" end="00:57:17.670" style="s2">written I think we talked about this in</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.790" end="00:57:19.170" style="s2">the zombie book don&#39;t we do we I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.670" end="00:57:20.910" style="s2">know I don&#39;t know how I don&#39;t think we</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.170" end="00:57:23.640" style="s2">get week we do I don&#39;t think we get too</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.910" end="00:57:26.520" style="s2">too deeply into the thief in cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.640" end="00:57:27.390" style="s2">science vocabulary but yeah it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.520" end="00:57:29.700" style="s2">there somehow yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.390" end="00:57:31.829" style="s2">do you guys know that the work of Rene</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.700" end="00:57:33.480" style="s2">Girard because one of my question for</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.829" end="00:57:35.520" style="s2">from before John was and one of my</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.480" end="00:57:38.460" style="s2">thoughts about what beauty is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.520" end="00:57:40.200" style="s2">beyond mimetic desire on some level it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.460" end="00:57:42.180" style="s2">it&#39;s when you when you when you</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.200" end="00:57:45.059" style="s2">experience uniqueness that is beyond</p>

<p begin="00:57:45.059" end="00:57:48.599" style="s2">is sort of and that&#39;s what we&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.010" end="00:57:52.349" style="s2">looking for because we&#39;re always trapped</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.599" end="00:57:53.970" style="s2">in a memetic Hall of Mirrors on some</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.349" end="00:57:56.040" style="s2">level we&#39;re always we&#39;re copying each</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.970" end="00:58:00.000" style="s2">other and we&#39;re we&#39;re stumbling around</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.040" end="00:58:01.920" style="s2">with with concepts at least I am and and</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.000" end="00:58:03.720" style="s2">then and we kind of break through and</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.920" end="00:58:07.619" style="s2">then we have this fresh moment that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.720" end="00:58:09.150" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s beyond yeah mimetic desire</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.619" end="00:58:11.849" style="s2">does that does might does that make any</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.150" end="00:58:13.589" style="s2">sense makes total slips and Gerrard&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.849" end="00:58:16.440" style="s2">thing I think is an apropos here and his</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.589" end="00:58:19.260" style="s2">idea of you know of Jesus on undermining</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.440" end="00:58:21.089" style="s2">like Jesus being the criticality and</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.260" end="00:58:22.190" style="s2">think about the word critical in crisis</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.089" end="00:58:24.299" style="s2">and cross and how they&#39;re all related</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.190" end="00:58:27.059" style="s2">Jesus being the criticality that</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.299" end="00:58:29.250" style="s2">disturbs that that whole mimetic self</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.059" end="00:58:32.099" style="s2">enclosure I think that that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.250" end="00:58:33.599" style="s2">right because right the poor that so the</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.099" end="00:58:36.450" style="s2">thing to do is remember that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.599" end="00:58:39.809" style="s2">always not always silent but often</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.450" end="00:58:42.059" style="s2">silent partner cuz if Gerard is I mean</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.809" end="00:58:43.349" style="s2">his prototypical instance of what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.059" end="00:58:45.750" style="s2">talking about mimetic desire is</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.349" end="00:58:48.210" style="s2">covetousness right it&#39;s envy or jealousy</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.750" end="00:58:49.890" style="s2">envy yeah he said Envy is the most</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.210" end="00:58:51.869" style="s2">hidden desire the one we don&#39;t admit to</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.890" end="00:58:55.410" style="s2">ourselves so we&#39;re always being dragged</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.869" end="00:58:58.619" style="s2">around right and V so good appear nd to</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.410" end="00:59:00.359" style="s2">admiration which is a virtue what is it</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.619" end="00:59:04.260" style="s2">when you admire somebody and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.359" end="00:59:07.770" style="s2">envy them right is it instant so think</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.260" end="00:59:09.299" style="s2">about arrows as so when I want to be one</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.770" end="00:59:11.119" style="s2">with someone I can reduce that to</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.299" end="00:59:14.220" style="s2">consumption I&#39;m gonna be on one by</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.119" end="00:59:16.290" style="s2">consuming you more it can be an arrow</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.220" end="00:59:19.920" style="s2">that is turning its face towards agape</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.290" end="00:59:21.450" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna generative as because Plato</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.920" end="00:59:22.540" style="s2">says I&#39;m gonna generate beauty within</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.450" end="00:59:24.960" style="s2">beauty</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.540" end="00:59:29.050" style="s2">so I&#39;m going to try and create a life</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.960" end="00:59:31.180" style="s2">that you know that is in some relevant</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.050" end="00:59:33.700" style="s2">sense similar to Socrates but not</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.180" end="00:59:35.710" style="s2">Socrates hmm it&#39;s my I&#39;m not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.700" end="00:59:38.530" style="s2">take from Socrates I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.710" end="00:59:41.350" style="s2">generate in admiration and so I think</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.530" end="00:59:43.840" style="s2">this is exactly what we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.350" end="00:59:46.780" style="s2">here right if we have a beauty that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.840" end="00:59:49.210" style="s2">just a smooth that is just the act of</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.780" end="00:59:51.820" style="s2">assimilation consuming making it one</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.210" end="00:59:55.030" style="s2">with me in no way disturbing me in no</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.820" end="00:59:58.300" style="s2">way being a critical moment for me but</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.030" end="01:00:00.970" style="s2">if I have genuine beauty then I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.300" end="01:00:03.330" style="s2">to be drawn beyond myself yeah but the</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.970" end="01:00:07.110" style="s2">critical moment also is recognized her</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.330" end="01:00:10.750" style="s2">happens Envy at times rather than just</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.110" end="01:00:13.990" style="s2">trying to aspire to to an ideal you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.750" end="01:00:16.000" style="s2">state of admiration is that that we</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.990" end="01:00:18.910" style="s2">notice that we feel that in that way at</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.000" end="01:00:21.010" style="s2">time but that but that&#39;s exactly the</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.910" end="01:00:22.630" style="s2">point right it this is to add to what</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.010" end="01:00:23.880" style="s2">you&#39;re saying about how we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.630" end="01:00:27.790" style="s2">reinvent your virtue</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.880" end="01:00:30.190" style="s2">Socratic virtue is always inseparably</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.790" end="01:00:32.860" style="s2">bound up with self-knowledge right and</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.190" end="01:00:34.750" style="s2">it&#39;s the kind of its this is this is one</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.860" end="01:00:36.990" style="s2">of the great Socratic insights there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.750" end="01:00:39.550" style="s2">aspects of myself that I can&#39;t know by</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.990" end="01:00:41.320" style="s2">introspection or even reflection I can</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.550" end="01:00:43.270" style="s2">only know them in interaction with you</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.320" end="01:00:45.910" style="s2">because they call forth both the</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.270" end="01:00:48.070" style="s2">potential for virtue and vice in me then</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.910" end="01:00:50.560" style="s2">I can&#39;t call forth of myself or make</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.070" end="01:00:53.410" style="s2">available to myself but if I pay</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.560" end="01:00:56.500" style="s2">attention if I come in good faith to the</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.410" end="01:00:59.560" style="s2">dialog I can become aware of my Envy and</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.500" end="01:01:03.250" style="s2">I can open myself up to a different</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.560" end="01:01:05.410" style="s2">possibility therein yeah because at that</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.250" end="01:01:07.540" style="s2">moment you&#39;re no longer seeing through</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.410" end="01:01:09.310" style="s2">you&#39;re no longer seeing and knowing by</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.540" end="01:01:14.520" style="s2">means of your envi when it becomes</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.310" end="01:01:17.170" style="s2">opaquely knowable to you as such</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.520" end="01:01:19.540" style="s2">possibility of transcending it becomes</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.170" end="01:01:21.520" style="s2">then available right by knowing it</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.540" end="01:01:25.410" style="s2">that&#39;s a bit like the shadow as well</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.520" end="01:01:27.970" style="s2">isn&#39;t it about absolutely yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.410" end="01:01:29.560" style="s2">shadows by how you put you have to pay</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.970" end="01:01:31.030" style="s2">it if you just think you didn&#39;t give</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.560" end="01:01:32.650" style="s2">your shadow by just doing active</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.030" end="01:01:34.660" style="s2">imagination and sitting inside your room</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.650" end="01:01:35.830" style="s2">you have missed Jung&#39;s point you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.660" end="01:01:38.230" style="s2">going to get your</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.830" end="01:01:39.280" style="s2">when you realize how you&#39;re projecting</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.230" end="01:01:41.830" style="s2">onto other people</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.280" end="01:01:44.380" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s only when you recognize your</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.830" end="01:01:47.920" style="s2">projections and hear the other person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.380" end="01:01:50.200" style="s2">right what way like hear the other</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.920" end="01:01:52.150" style="s2">person behind what you projected on them</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.200" end="01:01:54.370" style="s2">when you open up to the other nough</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.150" end="01:01:56.230" style="s2">speed or projection so they can break</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.370" end="01:01:59.020" style="s2">through the projection then and only</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.230" end="01:02:01.000" style="s2">then do you realize your projection yes</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.020" end="01:02:03.510" style="s2">and then the process of doing that could</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.000" end="01:02:10.990" style="s2">just they become dialectical of course</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.510" end="01:02:15.570" style="s2">of course so so the beauty is is perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.990" end="01:02:15.570" style="s2">also a moment of deep sincerity right</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.110" end="01:02:22.090" style="s2">rather than let&#39;s say it&#39;s a pretension</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.060" end="01:02:24.060" style="s2">or yeah I totally totally I mean that so</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.090" end="01:02:27.970" style="s2">you know Socratic humility is important</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.060" end="01:02:29.740" style="s2">I think that&#39;s the proper I we talked</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.970" end="01:02:31.150" style="s2">about this last time the proper response</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.740" end="01:02:33.610" style="s2">to beauty is reverence and Brett</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.150" end="01:02:36.640" style="s2">reverence has humility within it right</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.610" end="01:02:38.980" style="s2">it&#39;s reverence is is this bi-directional</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.640" end="01:02:41.200" style="s2">realization there&#39;s right there you</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.980" end="01:02:43.300" style="s2">recognize who you are there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.200" end="01:02:44.980" style="s2">intimacy with who you are and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.300" end="01:02:46.960" style="s2">also a recognition of the mourners</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.980" end="01:02:52.540" style="s2">beyond you that can nevertheless afford</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.960" end="01:02:56.640" style="s2">your transformation and and beauty</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.540" end="01:03:01.750" style="s2">beauty is such - that it it even as it</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.640" end="01:03:05.770" style="s2">even it even as it contradicts Abreva in</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.750" end="01:03:09.190" style="s2">adequacy it also saves you from it</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.770" end="01:03:11.290" style="s2">exactly if he heals you and it rescues</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.190" end="01:03:15.400" style="s2">you from the interminable death at the</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.290" end="01:03:20.020" style="s2">same time it is it is it it inflicts</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.400" end="01:03:22.720" style="s2">upon you death without without the</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.020" end="01:03:27.160" style="s2">undying death yeah that makes me think</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.720" end="01:03:28.570" style="s2">of Ulysses you know there&#39;s the Homeric</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.160" end="01:03:33.790" style="s2">version of Allah sees and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.570" end="01:03:37.990" style="s2">James Joyce Ulysses and the character is</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.790" end="01:03:41.320" style="s2">so flawed he&#39;s he&#39;s so human right so we</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.990" end="01:03:42.880" style="s2">have this ideal and then we have our you</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.320" end="01:03:47.530" style="s2">know both those things and he becomes</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.880" end="01:03:49.509" style="s2">the hero just threw his mmm I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.530" end="01:03:54.759" style="s2">I guess there was authenticity</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.509" end="01:03:55.869" style="s2">on some the the yeah that&#39;s just what</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.759" end="01:03:58.179" style="s2">came to mind when you were speaking</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.869" end="01:04:02.019" style="s2">about this yeah no I like that I think</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.179" end="01:04:05.649" style="s2">that fits very well so so what about the</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.019" end="01:04:07.239" style="s2">specific proposal of because we because</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.649" end="01:04:09.639" style="s2">there&#39;s also a specific proposal I made</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.239" end="01:04:12.069" style="s2">about under which is part of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.639" end="01:04:14.199" style="s2">reinvent EO of beauty and also</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.069" end="01:04:17.079" style="s2">simultaneously the re inventor of virtue</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.199" end="01:04:19.119" style="s2">to see virtue as the beauty of wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.079" end="01:04:20.079" style="s2">and this is a different way I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.119" end="01:04:23.380" style="s2">to propose a different way of thinking</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.079" end="01:04:26.799" style="s2">about both virtue and beauty in light of</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.380" end="01:04:27.999" style="s2">or in virtue of wisdom itself what do</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.799" end="01:04:30.880" style="s2">you think about that as a proposal</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.999" end="01:04:32.889" style="s2">because there&#39;s it&#39;s always been</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.880" end="01:04:35.289" style="s2">mysterious to me in Plato when he talks</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.889" end="01:04:36.459" style="s2">about the beauty of virtue and why we</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.289" end="01:04:40.749" style="s2">should care about it and why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.459" end="01:04:42.880" style="s2">superior to sensual beauty but if it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.749" end="01:04:45.309" style="s2">way in which we refine to wisdom itself</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.880" end="01:04:50.459" style="s2">then I can understand why it should</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.309" end="01:04:53.409" style="s2">matter to us so much I think it makes it</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.459" end="01:04:56.079" style="s2">existentially available it provides an</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.409" end="01:04:58.329" style="s2">entree into wisdom what that is</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.079" end="01:05:04.659" style="s2">ordinarily the the so who know entree</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.329" end="01:05:08.529" style="s2">virtue the virtue right so the V because</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.659" end="01:05:10.029" style="s2">virtue is both speakable and possessive</p>

<p begin="01:05:10.029" end="01:05:15.969" style="s2">right it straddles both levels of</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.630" end="01:05:18.429" style="s2">signification so you can speak about</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.969" end="01:05:21.459" style="s2">virtue that&#39;s right and you can inhabit</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.429" end="01:05:25.689" style="s2">virtue and my body virtue and so because</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.459" end="01:05:29.789" style="s2">of that it provides a kind of access it</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.689" end="01:05:33.429" style="s2">provides a kind of it provides a way to</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.789" end="01:05:37.599" style="s2">inhabit beauty so when you were talking</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.429" end="01:05:40.630" style="s2">about the the idea of that that that</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.599" end="01:05:43.059" style="s2">beauty when a being in right relation to</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.630" end="01:05:45.309" style="s2">beauty is such that you can&#39;t you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.059" end="01:05:47.589" style="s2">have a consumptively mimetic</p>

<p begin="01:05:51.880" end="01:05:57.219" style="s2">right relation to beauty is somehow also</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.369" end="01:05:59.079" style="s2">mimetic in the sense that is that</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.219" end="01:06:01.659" style="s2">mimesis of that which is not</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.079" end="01:06:03.120" style="s2">imitatable i don&#39;t know if that&#39;s where</p>

<p begin="01:06:03.120" end="01:06:09.300" style="s2">if-if-if mimesis of that which is not</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.330" end="01:06:12.750" style="s2">able to be imitated is precisely what</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.300" end="01:06:14.930" style="s2">induces the a paretic experience</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.750" end="01:06:20.010" style="s2">oh and there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.930" end="01:06:22.890" style="s2">inhabiting the virtue that is a a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.010" end="01:06:25.380" style="s2">an effort it&#39;s a it&#39;s an effort to</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.890" end="01:06:28.290" style="s2">imitate that which is in them innama</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.380" end="01:06:30.120" style="s2">table that&#39;s where in imitable it is it</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.290" end="01:06:32.670" style="s2">is the imitation of that which is</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.120" end="01:06:36.240" style="s2">inimitable and that is precisely what</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.670" end="01:06:38.790" style="s2">induces the a Perea but but the attempt</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.240" end="01:06:42.600" style="s2">to embody the virtue makes available the</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.790" end="01:06:44.100" style="s2">a poetic experience that is beautiful in</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.600" end="01:06:48.300" style="s2">its nature is that why you would wear</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.100" end="01:06:51.030" style="s2">masks in theatre and in a sense yeah</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.300" end="01:06:52.500" style="s2">yeah I think that yes yes absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.030" end="01:06:56.010" style="s2">because you&#39;re trying to imitate</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.500" end="01:06:57.900" style="s2">something the beauty of doing that</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.010" end="01:07:00.540" style="s2">that&#39;s beyond you on some level</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.900" end="01:07:02.700" style="s2">absolutely I mean theatre but also I</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.540" end="01:07:04.860" style="s2">plain I think of liturgy as well write</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.700" end="01:07:06.690" style="s2">in a more overtly religious sense right</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.860" end="01:07:08.820" style="s2">you are trying to imitate that which is</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.690" end="01:07:13.800" style="s2">inimitable you&#39;re trying to you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.820" end="01:07:16.770" style="s2">trying to affect a gesture toward a</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.800" end="01:07:19.830" style="s2">meaning that cannot be espoused in</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.770" end="01:07:21.900" style="s2">gesture and yet the precise that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.830" end="01:07:23.970" style="s2">a poetic effort you&#39;re teetering on the</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.900" end="01:07:28.680" style="s2">precipice of intelligibility at that</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.970" end="01:07:31.200" style="s2">moment but precisely that at that that</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.680" end="01:07:33.300" style="s2">precarious point that precarious edge</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.200" end="01:07:35.130" style="s2">that that beauty walks that as John</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.300" end="01:07:37.560" style="s2">described it that optimal balance of</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.130" end="01:07:39.870" style="s2">beauty between the horrific and the</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.560" end="01:07:41.940" style="s2">confirmed I have to admit I&#39;m having a</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.870" end="01:07:45.840" style="s2">hard time connecting Beauty to wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.940" end="01:07:47.580" style="s2">those two things don&#39;t don&#39;t go together</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.840" end="01:07:50.400" style="s2">for me on some level</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.580" end="01:07:52.550" style="s2">well perhaps again this is my romantic</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.400" end="01:07:56.640" style="s2">disposition because I always think that</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.550" end="01:07:59.280" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s when you cast off when you</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.640" end="01:08:02.160" style="s2">cast off any pretense of wisdom or non</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.280" end="01:08:06.060" style="s2">wisdom it&#39;s it&#39;s just a full full</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.160" end="01:08:10.920" style="s2">embrace of some kind but well some</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.060" end="01:08:12.290" style="s2">wisdom feels to me wisdom feels to me a</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.920" end="01:08:16.819" style="s2">step removed</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.290" end="01:08:19.819" style="s2">um I&#39;ve got does that make any sense but</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.819" end="01:08:24.319" style="s2">for us perhaps this is me being</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.819" end="01:08:26.049" style="s2">argumentative this is a good point this</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.319" end="01:08:30.170" style="s2">is a good this is a good point</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.049" end="01:08:34.370" style="s2">I think I think so maybe one place to</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.170" end="01:08:37.760" style="s2">start is that beauty beauty becomes a</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.370" end="01:08:38.420" style="s2">way of effecting profound changes in our</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.760" end="01:08:42.830" style="s2">advertent</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.420" end="01:08:47.960" style="s2">attention right beauty is what calls out</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.830" end="01:08:49.580" style="s2">and directs our attention and attention</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.960" end="01:08:52.040" style="s2">can be subject to all kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.580" end="01:08:54.470" style="s2">self-deceptive patterns patterns that</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.040" end="01:08:57.680" style="s2">recur patterns that are enshrined and</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.470" end="01:09:00.589" style="s2">entrenched into forceable habituated</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.680" end="01:09:04.130" style="s2">modes of being or modes of having I</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.589" end="01:09:07.520" style="s2">suppose and what Beauty does is it</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.130" end="01:09:09.920" style="s2">somehow Beauty can debilitate those</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.520" end="01:09:12.440" style="s2">patterns precisely because it can</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.920" end="01:09:15.140" style="s2">recover our attention and repurpose it</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.440" end="01:09:16.880" style="s2">and refocus it so I think maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.140" end="01:09:19.790" style="s2">one way to start is that I think of</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.880" end="01:09:22.220" style="s2">beauty as like the Herald of wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.790" end="01:09:24.260" style="s2">right it&#39;s what calls our attention to</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.220" end="01:09:27.680" style="s2">it it&#39;s not necessarily identical with</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.260" end="01:09:29.770" style="s2">it but it is the very thing that it is</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.680" end="01:09:33.609" style="s2">is the very thing that draws out</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.770" end="01:09:36.950" style="s2">aspiration because it&#39;s capable of of</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.609" end="01:09:38.870" style="s2">laying waste to the particular patterns</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.950" end="01:09:41.089" style="s2">by which we see and know at any given</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.870" end="01:09:43.280" style="s2">point like the sirens that are calling</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.089" end="01:09:44.930" style="s2">to like the sirens right which is a</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.280" end="01:09:50.270" style="s2">great example of how it can be used</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.930" end="01:09:53.839" style="s2">Cyclops versus the call Ulysses to his</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.270" end="01:09:57.320" style="s2">doom and somehow he has to make it home</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.839" end="01:09:59.780" style="s2">to us that&#39;s right to his wife who has</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.320" end="01:10:02.330" style="s2">been surrounded by suitors and all that</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.780" end="01:10:04.760" style="s2">so it&#39;s like yeah so yeah there&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.330" end="01:10:08.330" style="s2">this I get beauty is is is bound up in</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.760" end="01:10:11.090" style="s2">seduction and pathless right but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.330" end="01:10:14.630" style="s2">also bound up in insight mm-hmm right</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.090" end="01:10:17.570" style="s2">and like we talked about this last time</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.630" end="01:10:20.000" style="s2">about the machinery and the attentional</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.570" end="01:10:21.410" style="s2">machinery of beauty is also the same</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.000" end="01:10:23.510" style="s2">machinery especially if there&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.410" end="01:10:25.020" style="s2">criticality in it right you have to</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.510" end="01:10:27.180" style="s2">break out of a frame</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.020" end="01:10:30.240" style="s2">right that that being struck by beauty</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.180" end="01:10:32.490" style="s2">there&#39;s insight and and so if we if we</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.240" end="01:10:35.250" style="s2">get the training of attention and the</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.490" end="01:10:37.140" style="s2">affording of insight these are integral</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.250" end="01:10:38.760" style="s2">to the cultivation of wisdom they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.140" end="01:10:42.390" style="s2">integral to the cultivation of wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.760" end="01:10:43.980" style="s2">that&#39;s I mean that&#39;s why you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.390" end="01:10:46.020" style="s2">why meditative practices have been</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.980" end="01:10:48.030" style="s2">associated with the the cultivation of</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.020" end="01:10:49.590" style="s2">wisdom yeah it&#39;s precisely what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.030" end="01:10:55.920" style="s2">doing is training attention and</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.590" end="01:10:58.140" style="s2">affording insight yeah yeah yeah yeah it</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.920" end="01:11:01.980" style="s2">allows you to spew tea somehow the onset</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.140" end="01:11:06.510" style="s2">of beauty allows you to recast you to</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.980" end="01:11:08.610" style="s2">recast your your recast the mode the</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.510" end="01:11:11.280" style="s2">fort recast reform of life recast your</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.610" end="01:11:12.860" style="s2">mode of being in relation mm-hmm I think</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.280" end="01:11:16.740" style="s2">if we think of it as a fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.860" end="01:11:18.780" style="s2">relational dynamic then it can read it</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.740" end="01:11:21.360" style="s2">can refigure the way in which that is</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.780" end="01:11:23.640" style="s2">framed for you at any given month you</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.360" end="01:11:29.190" style="s2">must change your life you must change</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.640" end="01:11:32.340" style="s2">your life okay says that&#39;s what beauty</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.190" end="01:11:35.280" style="s2">does it tells us you know very directly</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.340" end="01:11:38.370" style="s2">that you know something some radical</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.280" end="01:11:41.370" style="s2">shift this is necessary that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.370" end="01:11:43.200" style="s2">virtue is the ability to appropriate</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.370" end="01:11:45.900" style="s2">with to take responsibility to</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.200" end="01:11:50.360" style="s2">appropriately respond to how every true</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.900" end="01:11:50.360" style="s2">disclosure was a true demand on you</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.980" end="01:11:56.430" style="s2">disclosure demand is exactly</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.660" end="01:11:58.980" style="s2">proportioning the relationship between</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.430" end="01:12:01.140" style="s2">more nests and suchness which is what I</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.980" end="01:12:02.850" style="s2">propose to you what beauty is and I</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.140" end="01:12:05.400" style="s2">think insofar as we&#39;re trying to get the</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.850" end="01:12:07.380" style="s2">Sophia of wisdom and the fermitas of</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.400" end="01:12:09.990" style="s2">wisdom that&#39;s virtue and that&#39;s a kind</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.380" end="01:12:14.100" style="s2">of beauty virtue was a regulation of</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.990" end="01:12:18.090" style="s2">beauty hmm get struck by beauty in a</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.100" end="01:12:19.920" style="s2">sense yeah and then the virtue is is how</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.090" end="01:12:22.410" style="s2">you navigate that pathos how do you</p>

<p begin="01:12:22.410" end="01:12:27.750" style="s2">that that thing that is that that can</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.140" end="01:12:29.940" style="s2">bring out all the you know the demons in</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.750" end="01:12:36.060" style="s2">you and and and also bring out your most</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.940" end="01:12:37.550" style="s2">heroic soulful being right it can again</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.060" end="01:12:39.950" style="s2">it can do both</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.550" end="01:12:44.510" style="s2">I think so and this is what Plato I mean</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.950" end="01:12:46.070" style="s2">so right philosophy is the virtue of</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.510" end="01:12:48.500" style="s2">what I like it&#39;s the appropriate virtue</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.070" end="01:12:50.720" style="s2">to the experience of wonder and reverent</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.500" end="01:12:53.690" style="s2">just like reverence Woodruff argues is</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.720" end="01:12:58.280" style="s2">the appropriate virtue for the you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.690" end="01:13:01.040" style="s2">for the experience of awe hmm but is but</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.280" end="01:13:02.630" style="s2">as philosophy ax is philosophy M one</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.040" end="01:13:05.240" style="s2">among the virtues John or is it the</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.630" end="01:13:06.620" style="s2">harmony of the virtues themselves well</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.240" end="01:13:08.270" style="s2">and I think a philosophy and a</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.620" end="01:13:11.990" style="s2">higher-order sense I think of it as the</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.270" end="01:13:16.040" style="s2">orchestration of the virtues oh it is I</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.990" end="01:13:18.620" style="s2">think it&#39;s it&#39;s but but philosophy of</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.040" end="01:13:21.110" style="s2">begins in wonder wonder has a special</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.620" end="01:13:23.330" style="s2">role for philosophy a photonic vision</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.110" end="01:13:24.680" style="s2">because wonder is exactly the moment of</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.330" end="01:13:27.530" style="s2">what we&#39;ve been talking about it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.680" end="01:13:29.180" style="s2">moment of so if we compare if we it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.530" end="01:13:31.280" style="s2">thought if we contrast wonder to</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.180" end="01:13:32.870" style="s2">curiosity where curiosity is there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.280" end="01:13:35.420" style="s2">something missing and I want to have it</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.870" end="01:13:37.460" style="s2">you know which is good but where wonder</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.420" end="01:13:39.710" style="s2">is I&#39;m willing to call myself in my</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.460" end="01:13:41.840" style="s2">world into question there can be no</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.710" end="01:13:43.490" style="s2">pursuit it&#39;s it&#39;s a wonder has I think</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.840" end="01:13:45.590" style="s2">in a special role I think you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.490" end="01:13:47.120" style="s2">philosophy is about all of the virtues</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.590" end="01:13:49.700" style="s2">but to use your term</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.120" end="01:13:51.920" style="s2">I think wonder is the entree it is the</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.700" end="01:13:54.320" style="s2">right right philosophy of first of all</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.920" end="01:13:56.630" style="s2">is the virtue of appropriately wondering</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.320" end="01:13:58.580" style="s2">because if we can&#39;t call ourself and our</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.630" end="01:14:02.480" style="s2">world into question none of the other</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.580" end="01:14:05.270" style="s2">virtues are attainable for us mm-hmm can</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.480" end="01:14:09.680" style="s2">I throw another formulation here just</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.270" end="01:14:11.450" style="s2">for yep just for fun but in the Buddhist</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.680" end="01:14:14.210" style="s2">tradition you have sutrayana which is</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.450" end="01:14:18.470" style="s2">about renunciation it&#39;s about training</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.210" end="01:14:21.740" style="s2">in moral virtue and it&#39;s about you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.470" end="01:14:25.490" style="s2">it&#39;s about taming and controlling your</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.740" end="01:14:28.850" style="s2">emotions and desires and and becoming</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.490" end="01:14:31.250" style="s2">becoming wise and compassionate in the</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.850" end="01:14:35.500" style="s2">world and then the next level tantrayana</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.250" end="01:14:38.270" style="s2">you step into another kind of world</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.500" end="01:14:40.520" style="s2">which which isn&#39;t isn&#39;t it&#39;s no longer</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.270" end="01:14:42.800" style="s2">it&#39;s no longer a process of training</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.520" end="01:14:47.420" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s more like you&#39;re hit</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.800" end="01:14:51.340" style="s2">directly by the by the energies yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.420" end="01:14:51.340" style="s2">so so though those two things</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.670" end="01:14:58.880" style="s2">so so and of course once you enter Don</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.209" end="01:15:00.619" style="s2">Triana you also have to eat you too to</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.880" end="01:15:02.059" style="s2">have embodied sue Triana</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.619" end="01:15:04.159" style="s2">like you have to become a morally</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.059" end="01:15:06.380" style="s2">virtuous person before you can you can</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.159" end="01:15:10.369" style="s2">you can wrestle with those those more</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.380" end="01:15:14.409" style="s2">direct energies it&#39;s deeply analogous to</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.369" end="01:15:16.940" style="s2">the Neoplatonic ascent right so the the</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.409" end="01:15:19.849" style="s2">Platonists has you know buddy calls the</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.940" end="01:15:22.519" style="s2">Civic virtues which is the virtues and</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.849" end="01:15:24.530" style="s2">you know this is the virtue of being you</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.519" end="01:15:26.030" style="s2">know living with others what we normally</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.530" end="01:15:28.670" style="s2">call the moral virtues but they&#39;re much</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.030" end="01:15:32.239" style="s2">more like we said here the understanding</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.670" end="01:15:34.699" style="s2">that this that the even the the moral</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.239" end="01:15:35.929" style="s2">virtues are not in purely individual</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.699" end="01:15:37.940" style="s2">projects they have to be done in</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.929" end="01:15:39.979" style="s2">community and in concert with other</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.940" end="01:15:42.440" style="s2">people and then you have what he calls</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.979" end="01:15:44.179" style="s2">you know the the cathartic or the</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.440" end="01:15:46.789" style="s2">purging virtues these are the virtues</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.179" end="01:15:48.530" style="s2">that take you beyond moral virtue</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.789" end="01:15:53.449" style="s2">because now what you&#39;re trying to do is</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.530" end="01:15:55.489" style="s2">not you&#39;re not trying to be honest or be</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.449" end="01:15:57.260" style="s2">good you&#39;re trying to see that about</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.489" end="01:16:00.170" style="s2">which the depths of you and the depths</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.260" end="01:16:02.659" style="s2">of a reality afford this there&#39;s this is</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.170" end="01:16:05.150" style="s2">a trans moral sense of goodness and this</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.659" end="01:16:07.130" style="s2">is what takes you to all so you can</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.150" end="01:16:10.610" style="s2">always thinking rational trans rational</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.130" end="01:16:12.739" style="s2">yes exactly exactly that&#39;s exactly what</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.610" end="01:16:15.440" style="s2">it is in Platonists that&#39;s exactly what</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.739" end="01:16:17.479" style="s2">it is you take you take the you take</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.440" end="01:16:19.849" style="s2">rational or what we could call here</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.479" end="01:16:21.800" style="s2">argumentation as far as it goes and what</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.849" end="01:16:24.260" style="s2">it&#39;s done is it&#39;s basically a scaffold</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.800" end="01:16:26.869" style="s2">that brings you up to a place where you</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.260" end="01:16:29.090" style="s2">can now see and be opened up that you</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.869" end="01:16:30.050" style="s2">can so I sometimes think of it like</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.090" end="01:16:31.190" style="s2">building a structure</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.050" end="01:16:33.170" style="s2">have you ever been in one of the</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.190" end="01:16:34.639" style="s2">pyramids in the Mayan jungles you climb</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.170" end="01:16:36.619" style="s2">up the pyramid and the point of the</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.639" end="01:16:38.570" style="s2">structure is to get to a place where you</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.619" end="01:16:40.099" style="s2">you you are struck in a way you can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.570" end="01:16:41.780" style="s2">struck when you&#39;re in the forest and</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.099" end="01:16:45.010" style="s2">you&#39;re open to calling yourself in your</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.780" end="01:16:46.760" style="s2">world into question mmm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.010" end="01:16:49.579" style="s2">argumentation is the building of the</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.760" end="01:16:52.459" style="s2">pyramid but when you can then be open to</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.579" end="01:16:53.959" style="s2">the sky and to the forest below you and</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.459" end="01:16:56.329" style="s2">you&#39;re willing to call everything now</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.959" end="01:16:59.059" style="s2">and do question that is that is that</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.329" end="01:17:01.400" style="s2">moving família logic propositional sort</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.059" end="01:17:03.559" style="s2">of understanding of things to a more</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.400" end="01:17:05.920" style="s2">spontaneous and let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.559" end="01:17:08.360" style="s2">dynamic it&#39;s moving a feeling of things</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.920" end="01:17:10.250" style="s2">respectable and participatory or does it</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.360" end="01:17:13.699" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s like the teleological</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.250" end="01:17:17.059" style="s2">suspension of the ethical and although I</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.699" end="01:17:21.969" style="s2">think it moves more into beauty guys it</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.059" end="01:17:25.670" style="s2">does it does Beauty becomes more more</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.969" end="01:17:27.320" style="s2">beauty and play you become become more</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.670" end="01:17:29.570" style="s2">important where in the beginning you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.320" end="01:17:31.340" style="s2">you&#39;re just slogging away and trying to</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.570" end="01:17:32.869" style="s2">understand and you&#39;ve got your machete</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.340" end="01:17:35.480" style="s2">and you&#39;re cutting your way through the</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.869" end="01:17:38.059" style="s2">jungle and yeah but the thing you have</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.480" end="01:17:41.960" style="s2">to remember is is there&#39;s a I mean for</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.059" end="01:17:44.630" style="s2">and this goes back to back to the stuff</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.960" end="01:17:46.369" style="s2">we were saying earlier about how Beauty</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.630" end="01:17:48.559" style="s2">you know how it kills you in</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.369" end="01:17:50.239" style="s2">resurrection like you know you&#39;re never</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.559" end="01:17:52.670" style="s2">gonna become a God in play-doh at most</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.239" end="01:17:54.590" style="s2">you&#39;re always gonna be godlike and and</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.670" end="01:17:56.059" style="s2">and you come out of the clave and see</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.590" end="01:17:58.429" style="s2">the Sun but you were turning back into</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.059" end="01:18:01.579" style="s2">the cave so the moments in my practice</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.429" end="01:18:02.420" style="s2">where I touch the one or the Sun or the</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.579" end="01:18:05.389" style="s2">ground of being</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.420" end="01:18:08.119" style="s2">they then feed back into when I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.389" end="01:18:10.070" style="s2">the right the propositional or very sort</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.119" end="01:18:12.050" style="s2">of thing right no yeah and of course I</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.070" end="01:18:14.179" style="s2">think of that then you know the comes</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.050" end="01:18:16.670" style="s2">back to the marketplace with yeah</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.179" end="01:18:18.800" style="s2">exactly you know what&#39;s about the I</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.670" end="01:18:22.369" style="s2">forget that you know there&#39;s in you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.800" end="01:18:25.460" style="s2">the the the Zen parables were where he</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.369" end="01:18:28.250" style="s2">you know he&#39;s he&#39;s chasing the the bull</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.460" end="01:18:31.489" style="s2">and then he&#39;s looking for the bull he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.250" end="01:18:33.170" style="s2">riding the ox and then and then and then</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.489" end="01:18:35.480" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing there&#39;s emptiness and</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.170" end="01:18:38.449" style="s2">then he comes back with with gifts you</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.480" end="01:18:41.900" style="s2">don&#39;t exactly so you know some you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.449" end="01:18:45.289" style="s2">those moments those moments of trans</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.900" end="01:18:47.329" style="s2">rational they they shine into they in</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.289" end="01:18:49.340" style="s2">power they in soul will they alive and</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.329" end="01:18:51.110" style="s2">they beautify the rational moments and</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.340" end="01:18:53.179" style="s2">then the rational moments have</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.110" end="01:18:55.429" style="s2">appropriate reverence to what is</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.179" end="01:18:58.820" style="s2">disclosed in the trans rational moments</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.429" end="01:19:01.010" style="s2">okay that&#39;s nice mmm-hmm although I</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.820" end="01:19:03.289" style="s2">guess I guess for someone like Allard</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.010" end="01:19:08.809" style="s2">that the entire process we&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.289" end="01:19:11.389" style="s2">described is rationality per se well</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.809" end="01:19:13.699" style="s2">yeah the aspiration to rationality in</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.389" end="01:19:15.780" style="s2">the aspiration to trans rationality is</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.699" end="01:19:20.050" style="s2">itself proleptic rationality</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.780" end="01:19:22.270" style="s2">yeah so far as we&#39;re aspiring to any</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.050" end="01:19:23.710" style="s2">even beat not even just a virtue but</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.270" end="01:19:27.820" style="s2">it&#39;s the ender said to something that is</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.710" end="01:19:29.590" style="s2">beyond virtue right the good beyond</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.820" end="01:19:32.830" style="s2">moral goodness</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.590" end="01:19:34.840" style="s2">I think we&#39;re engaged in the in some</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.830" end="01:19:39.040" style="s2">kind of proleptic process yes for sure</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.840" end="01:19:41.410" style="s2">yeah weird anyway we were engaged in</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.040" end="01:19:43.810" style="s2">aspiration and the other thing I was</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.410" end="01:19:45.700" style="s2">thinking about is how normally think of</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.810" end="01:19:48.100" style="s2">beauty as something very high high up</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.700" end="01:19:50.560" style="s2">there yeah very sublime and we&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.100" end="01:19:53.320" style="s2">very up here you know it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.560" end="01:19:55.030" style="s2">associated with high culture and and you</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.320" end="01:19:57.040" style="s2">know all that sort of stuff but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.030" end="01:19:58.750" style="s2">also you can find beauty in a rap song</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.040" end="01:20:01.630" style="s2">you can find beauty everywhere like</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.750" end="01:20:04.090" style="s2">easily and the lowest you know in the</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.630" end="01:20:07.510" style="s2">most you know but now things it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.090" end="01:20:10.240" style="s2">not something that is necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.510" end="01:20:13.540" style="s2">hierarchical or isn&#39;t that the same for</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.240" end="01:20:15.460" style="s2">virtue mmm we find virtue in our highest</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.540" end="01:20:17.050" style="s2">ideals but if that&#39;s useless if you</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.460" end="01:20:23.710" style="s2">can&#39;t find it in then my new show of</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.050" end="01:20:26.830" style="s2">your life right yeah well yeah it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.710" end="01:20:30.850" style="s2">that it&#39;s it&#39;s like the in the way that</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.830" end="01:20:32.650" style="s2">the well not by analogy by identity the</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.850" end="01:20:35.440" style="s2">way the Neoplatonic hypostasis are</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.650" end="01:20:38.950" style="s2">dispersed ontologically dispersed</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.440" end="01:20:41.470" style="s2">without somehow being diminished yeah</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.950" end="01:20:43.690" style="s2">right yeah the Sun shines but it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.470" end="01:20:45.790" style="s2">but it&#39;s not diminished by it&#39;s shining</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.690" end="01:20:48.490" style="s2">yeah even or close it says that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.790" end="01:20:51.130" style="s2">true but i get i get i get platonist as</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.490" end="01:20:55.450" style="s2">metaphor at least right exhaustive who</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.130" end="01:20:59.560" style="s2">cares about the physics the one</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.450" end="01:21:01.600" style="s2">overflows or or or or like the top hm</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.560" end="01:21:03.160" style="s2">right the the the dow is a well that you</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.600" end="01:21:07.270" style="s2">connect you and you can just continually</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.160" end="01:21:11.230" style="s2">draw forth from it yeah yes mm-hmm yes I</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.270" end="01:21:13.270" style="s2">should get going soon gentlemen and I</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.230" end="01:21:15.570" style="s2">think we&#39;re seeming to fall into kind of</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.270" end="01:21:18.430" style="s2">a wonderful convivial silence anyways</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.570" end="01:21:20.800" style="s2">yeah yeah there&#39;s a silence descending</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.430" end="01:21:21.940" style="s2">on the conversation somewhat I agree and</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.800" end="01:21:23.200" style="s2">it&#39;s a good one though it&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.940" end="01:21:25.060" style="s2">wonderful one so what are we getting</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.200" end="01:21:27.340" style="s2">we&#39;ve reinvented beauty and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.060" end="01:21:29.050" style="s2">reinvented the soul and and</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.340" end="01:21:30.849" style="s2">so what are we gonna and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.050" end="01:21:33.280" style="s2">reinvented virtue so what are we gonna</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.849" end="01:21:35.590" style="s2">reinvent next well like I said I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.280" end="01:21:36.760" style="s2">trying to reinvent rationality and not</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.590" end="01:21:38.560" style="s2">now today I was trying to bring them</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.760" end="01:21:40.719" style="s2">together with reinventing argumentation</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.560" end="01:21:42.969" style="s2">within dialectic I just want to keep</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.719" end="01:21:44.909" style="s2">going because a great synthesis John</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.969" end="01:21:46.929" style="s2">incidentally like there was a fantastic</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.909" end="01:21:49.270" style="s2">theoretical synthesis that you opened</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.929" end="01:21:50.920" style="s2">with very very well thank you for that I</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.270" end="01:21:53.860" style="s2">mean I&#39;m trying like I said I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.920" end="01:21:55.780" style="s2">to get at what would die illogical</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.860" end="01:21:57.730" style="s2">argumentation look like rather than</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.780" end="01:22:00.280" style="s2">monological argumentation I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.730" end="01:22:02.590" style="s2">get more the sense of logos as drawing</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.280" end="01:22:04.270" style="s2">together the affording insight that</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.590" end="01:22:06.400" style="s2">moves you to the next proposal the draws</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.270" end="01:22:09.670" style="s2">together like it&#39;s different than just</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.400" end="01:22:11.650" style="s2">premise premise premise but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.670" end="01:22:13.840" style="s2">embodied in feeling isn&#39;t it it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.650" end="01:22:17.369" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s broadened into the the entire</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.840" end="01:22:22.270" style="s2">realm of feeling in the body rather than</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.369" end="01:22:24.250" style="s2">just upstairs very much very much it</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.270" end="01:22:26.590" style="s2">goes back to your metropolis thing we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.250" end="01:22:28.960" style="s2">trying to link and and heart and head</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.590" end="01:22:32.980" style="s2">together right in this sense of</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.960" end="01:22:36.070" style="s2">argumentation and so and trying to in</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.980" end="01:22:39.639" style="s2">soul and and heartening and and you know</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.070" end="01:22:42.130" style="s2">make make beautiful all of these things</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.639" end="01:22:43.690" style="s2">because notice that we were willing I</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.130" end="01:22:45.849" style="s2">mean we came a good faith and we were</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.690" end="01:22:48.219" style="s2">willing to probe and push and move and</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.849" end="01:22:50.260" style="s2">challenge but all that did was afford</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.219" end="01:22:54.810" style="s2">right it just afforded more and more and</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.260" end="01:22:57.880" style="s2">more and that&#39;s again III and like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.810" end="01:22:59.560" style="s2">I&#39;m working my way towards this I I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.880" end="01:23:01.810" style="s2">not complaint I&#39;m not claiming anything</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.560" end="01:23:09.130" style="s2">complete hearing but I&#39;m trying to get</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.810" end="01:23:14.110" style="s2">what this would look like for us yeah</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.130" end="01:23:16.630" style="s2">well it&#39;s it&#39;s I also want say Andrew</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.110" end="01:23:19.239" style="s2">that it&#39;s very helpful because John and</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.630" end="01:23:20.679" style="s2">I John and I do this all the time and</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.239" end="01:23:22.810" style="s2">because there&#39;s a certain shorthand and</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.679" end="01:23:25.389" style="s2">there&#39;s a certain shared vocabulary yeah</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.810" end="01:23:27.369" style="s2">one thing that you introduce that we</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.389" end="01:23:30.070" style="s2">don&#39;t really have as much on our own is</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.369" end="01:23:33.849" style="s2">you introduce the kind of more the more</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.070" end="01:23:35.530" style="s2">sort of interrogative challenge that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.849" end="01:23:37.690" style="s2">actually very helpful which it</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.530" end="01:23:39.670" style="s2">diminishes it diminishes a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.690" end="01:23:41.020" style="s2">because once you become very very very</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.670" end="01:23:42.640" style="s2">fluent and how can</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.020" end="01:23:45.700" style="s2">you are with another person once there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.640" end="01:23:47.740" style="s2">such a shared once there&#39;s there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.700" end="01:23:50.230" style="s2">much of a shared vocabulary that things</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.740" end="01:23:52.630" style="s2">become you you don&#39;t realize how like</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.230" end="01:23:54.340" style="s2">when up won&#39;t clairvoyance or so engine</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.630" end="01:23:56.560" style="s2">yeah when John I speak just the two of</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.340" end="01:23:59.110" style="s2">us there&#39;s we&#39;re standing on so many</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.560" end="01:24:00.970" style="s2">unspoken presumptions and so many sort</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.110" end="01:24:03.160" style="s2">of shared axioms that a lot goes</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.970" end="01:24:05.890" style="s2">unchallenged simply because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.160" end="01:24:07.540" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s so much you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.890" end="01:24:09.580" style="s2">so much underfoot that sort of goes</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.540" end="01:24:12.100" style="s2">unacknowledged but one thing that you</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.580" end="01:24:14.470" style="s2">add to this one of the many things you</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.100" end="01:24:18.280" style="s2">add to this is that you challenge some</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.470" end="01:24:20.760" style="s2">of those some of those presumptions used</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.280" end="01:24:24.760" style="s2">to challenge some of those sort of those</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.760" end="01:24:26.770" style="s2">those unspoken premises that were</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.760" end="01:24:28.330" style="s2">standing on without realizing that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.770" end="01:24:30.310" style="s2">standing on them whether they be having</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.330" end="01:24:32.170" style="s2">to do with vocabulary or having to do</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.310" end="01:24:35.110" style="s2">with the use of certain terms etc and</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.170" end="01:24:36.910" style="s2">that&#39;s very very helpful to in the</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.110" end="01:24:39.010" style="s2">proper sense of the term to humiliate</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.910" end="01:24:41.260" style="s2">the conversation and we&#39;re all it into</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.010" end="01:24:44.610" style="s2">proper question and you I think you</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.260" end="01:24:47.290" style="s2">bring that beautifully and very and very</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.610" end="01:24:49.570" style="s2">definitely and I think you guys are</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.290" end="01:24:52.630" style="s2">really teaching me something here about</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.570" end="01:24:56.110" style="s2">about listening and finding that the</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.630" end="01:24:58.480" style="s2">right moment to interject and I do feel</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.110" end="01:25:01.480" style="s2">like I&#39;m stumbling around a lot of the</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.480" end="01:25:02.860" style="s2">time but but a bit less so I feel like</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.480" end="01:25:06.130" style="s2">there&#39;s a harmony coming into these</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.860" end="01:25:09.450" style="s2">conversations that that that you know</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.130" end="01:25:13.120" style="s2">each time that that&#39;s a little bit and</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.450" end="01:25:15.610" style="s2">that just kind of strikes me and makes</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.120" end="01:25:17.920" style="s2">me you know go wow you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.610" end="01:25:18.760" style="s2">amazing you know something is really</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.920" end="01:25:23.860" style="s2">happening here</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.760" end="01:25:26.230" style="s2">to me so so so what you were saying</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.860" end="01:25:29.260" style="s2">about dialo goes being this process</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.230" end="01:25:33.190" style="s2">where something is being brought out of</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.260" end="01:25:36.310" style="s2">you that you you that you couldn&#39;t find</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.190" end="01:25:39.370" style="s2">on your own I think that&#39;s happening to</p>
