<p begin="00:00:15.280" end="00:00:18.720" style="s2">welcome back to the dark horse podcast</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.840" end="00:00:22.480" style="s2">live stream</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.720" end="00:00:23.519" style="s2">q a with more cat bell as requested</p>

<p begin="00:00:29.840" end="00:00:32.320" style="s2">start with two questions from last</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.439" end="00:00:36.719" style="s2">episode</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.320" end="00:00:38.559" style="s2">and uh then move on to the ones from</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.719" end="00:00:41.840" style="s2">last hour so my last episode i meant the</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.559" end="00:00:41.840" style="s2">one on july 28th</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.920" end="00:00:45.920" style="s2">with the use of powerful lasers in riots</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.000" end="00:00:47.760" style="s2">and protests has any concern been raised</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.920" end="00:00:50.000" style="s2">in regards to injury to others beyond</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.760" end="00:00:51.600" style="s2">the federal agents</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.000" end="00:00:53.360" style="s2">this was interesting cause i just i i at</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.600" end="00:00:56.000" style="s2">least have not heard</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.360" end="00:00:56.800" style="s2">that raised as an issue yeah uh it is an</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.000" end="00:00:57.760" style="s2">issue though</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.800" end="00:01:00.079" style="s2">it is an issue but i haven&#39;t heard</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.760" end="00:01:02.000" style="s2">anyone talk about it yeah lasers are uh</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.079" end="00:01:03.600" style="s2">available now to the public that are so</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.000" end="00:01:04.320" style="s2">powerful that you can actually do</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.600" end="00:01:08.159" style="s2">significant</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.320" end="00:01:11.119" style="s2">damage to people you can disrupt</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.159" end="00:01:12.000" style="s2">aviation drones and actually commercial</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.119" end="00:01:14.720" style="s2">aviation also</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.000" end="00:01:16.960" style="s2">there are like some instances of people</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.720" end="00:01:18.320" style="s2">shining lasers into the cockpits of</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.960" end="00:01:20.320" style="s2">planes going overhead and things like</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.320" end="00:01:21.600" style="s2">that that&#39;s been true for a while</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.320" end="00:01:23.119" style="s2">yes that&#39;s yeah for a number of years i</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.600" end="00:01:24.880" style="s2">don&#39;t know that the lasers have gotten</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.119" end="00:01:25.680" style="s2">much more powerful in the last few years</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.880" end="00:01:27.439" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.680" end="00:01:28.960" style="s2">but anyway there are real dangers here</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.439" end="00:01:31.200" style="s2">and the fact is this is</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.960" end="00:01:32.640" style="s2">a model for a lot of things which is we</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.200" end="00:01:35.759" style="s2">are becoming</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.640" end="00:01:38.799" style="s2">um incapable of dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.759" end="00:01:41.439" style="s2">the weapons that are now available at</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.799" end="00:01:42.640" style="s2">trivial expense so you&#39;re putting you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.439" end="00:01:43.600" style="s2">putting these things in the hands of</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.640" end="00:01:47.040" style="s2">people who</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.600" end="00:01:48.880" style="s2">um are not prepared to deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.040" end="00:01:51.680" style="s2">responsibility of it so</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.880" end="00:01:53.280" style="s2">uh it&#39;s a little hard to say i have not</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.680" end="00:01:56.240" style="s2">heard anybody discuss it beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.280" end="00:01:57.600" style="s2">federal agents but obviously</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.240" end="00:01:59.759" style="s2">you can reach an arbitrarily long</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.600" end="00:02:02.560" style="s2">distance with these things and</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.759" end="00:02:04.240" style="s2">um people will do it to the extent that</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.560" end="00:02:04.960" style="s2">they identify targets beyond federal</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.240" end="00:02:07.280" style="s2">agents</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.960" end="00:02:08.000" style="s2">it&#39;s only a matter of time absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.280" end="00:02:11.039" style="s2">okay so</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.000" end="00:02:13.200" style="s2">uh the second question from</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.039" end="00:02:15.360" style="s2">the live stream that we did a few days</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.200" end="00:02:15.920" style="s2">ago uh and then we&#39;ll get to today&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.360" end="00:02:17.840" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.920" end="00:02:19.440" style="s2">the ghost of live stream passed the</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.840" end="00:02:21.040" style="s2">ghost the ghost of livestreams</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.440" end="00:02:22.239" style="s2">pass exactly i will say that the</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.040" end="00:02:23.040" style="s2">questions that came in today which i</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.239" end="00:02:25.040" style="s2">only had time to</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.040" end="00:02:27.120" style="s2">you know briefly look at insert are</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.040" end="00:02:29.120" style="s2">amazing it&#39;s really good today and</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.120" end="00:02:30.800" style="s2">are there any stumpers uh probably like</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.120" end="00:02:33.599" style="s2">i actually am yes</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.800" end="00:02:35.440" style="s2">i expect so uh what potential does</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.599" end="00:02:37.360" style="s2">confirmation bias have in causing</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.440" end="00:02:38.800" style="s2">science to go down the wrong path</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.360" end="00:02:40.560" style="s2">and if something that&#39;s foundational is</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.800" end="00:02:42.959" style="s2">found to be incorrect</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.560" end="00:02:44.720" style="s2">how quickly can any given field reliably</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.959" end="00:02:47.280" style="s2">course correct</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.720" end="00:02:49.040" style="s2">great question yeah i thought so too uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.280" end="00:02:51.120" style="s2">so i would say we have a built-in</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.040" end="00:02:52.319" style="s2">problem which is that we have plugged</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.120" end="00:02:55.360" style="s2">markets into</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.319" end="00:02:58.480" style="s2">our thinking and sense making apparatus</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.360" end="00:02:59.599" style="s2">and they are incompatible and so what we</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.480" end="00:03:03.200" style="s2">have is a system</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.599" end="00:03:06.319" style="s2">in which we basically award</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.200" end="00:03:08.159" style="s2">the right to fund progress to whatever</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.319" end="00:03:08.800" style="s2">school of thought we declare to be the</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.159" end="00:03:10.959" style="s2">most</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.800" end="00:03:12.640" style="s2">effective at any given moment and what</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.959" end="00:03:13.440" style="s2">this means is that when a school of</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.640" end="00:03:17.280" style="s2">thought</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.440" end="00:03:18.000" style="s2">is on the rise it has the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.280" end="00:03:20.560" style="s2">kill off its</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.000" end="00:03:22.480" style="s2">competitors when it eventually runs into</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.560" end="00:03:24.080" style="s2">extreme diminishing returns</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.480" end="00:03:25.519" style="s2">there&#39;s nobody who left who knows how to</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.080" end="00:03:27.680" style="s2">think any other way</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.519" end="00:03:28.879" style="s2">this is an obvious thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.680" end="00:03:32.799" style="s2">correctable yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.879" end="00:03:34.720" style="s2">the solution is completely clear but</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.799" end="00:03:36.640" style="s2">we see field after field getting stuck</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.720" end="00:03:39.680" style="s2">as a result of exactly this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.640" end="00:03:41.040" style="s2">um broken modality so kind of sorry how</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.680" end="00:03:43.040" style="s2">quickly can they recover</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.040" end="00:03:44.239" style="s2">depends how long they&#39;ve been going in</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.040" end="00:03:46.799" style="s2">the same direction</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.239" end="00:03:47.920" style="s2">and i think the problem is ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.799" end="00:03:50.640" style="s2">the pattern we see</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.920" end="00:03:52.080" style="s2">is well i mean we see it manifest in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.640" end="00:03:55.280" style="s2">number of things i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.080" end="00:03:58.000" style="s2">planck who uh said</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.280" end="00:03:58.480" style="s2">science progresses funeral by funeral</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.000" end="00:04:00.640" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.480" end="00:04:02.799" style="s2">others have pointed out that it is very</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.640" end="00:04:05.439" style="s2">frequently outsiders to a field</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.799" end="00:04:07.200" style="s2">that um set new progress in motion</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.439" end="00:04:08.799" style="s2">because the people inside the field</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.200" end="00:04:10.400" style="s2">can&#39;t figure out what&#39;s gone wrong</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.799" end="00:04:12.000" style="s2">they&#39;re too steeped in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.400" end="00:04:13.519" style="s2">incorrect school of thought and</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.000" end="00:04:15.680" style="s2">outsiders can come</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.519" end="00:04:16.720" style="s2">you know we often think of that in terms</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.680" end="00:04:18.720" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.720" end="00:04:19.840" style="s2">outsiders who are already expert in</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.720" end="00:04:23.440" style="s2">something right like</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.840" end="00:04:25.040" style="s2">um external people who are the peers</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.440" end="00:04:26.800" style="s2">otherwise in terms of sort of rank and</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.040" end="00:04:29.120" style="s2">society uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.800" end="00:04:30.960" style="s2">but it&#39;s also of course what what the</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.120" end="00:04:32.880" style="s2">youth do it&#39;s what it&#39;s what the people</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.960" end="00:04:34.880" style="s2">up and coming in and discipline can do</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.880" end="00:04:36.400" style="s2">when they when they are new to a field</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.880" end="00:04:37.520" style="s2">they start looking around and go well</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.400" end="00:04:38.960" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna poke at that because that</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.520" end="00:04:40.320" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem to make sense and this this</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.960" end="00:04:42.639" style="s2">reminds me of</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.320" end="00:04:44.320" style="s2">uh the analogy that you told me a long</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.639" end="00:04:47.120" style="s2">time ago about your experience</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.320" end="00:04:47.919" style="s2">in high school when you were fencing uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.120" end="00:04:49.600" style="s2">do you want to</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.919" end="00:04:50.880" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s an observation that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.600" end="00:04:52.000" style="s2">made by other people for their context</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.880" end="00:04:52.560" style="s2">but this is something you actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.000" end="00:04:55.440" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.560" end="00:04:56.160" style="s2">so i had the uh the good fortune of</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.440" end="00:04:59.199" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.160" end="00:05:02.800" style="s2">a absolutely novice fencer</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.199" end="00:05:06.960" style="s2">in a fencing program that had</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.800" end="00:05:09.360" style="s2">a guy headed for the olympics</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.960" end="00:05:11.440" style="s2">so he was an excellent fencer and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.360" end="00:05:13.199" style="s2">thing is his excellent fencing</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.440" end="00:05:14.479" style="s2">left an opening for you if you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.199" end="00:05:15.120" style="s2">know what you were doing because the</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.479" end="00:05:18.080" style="s2">point is</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.120" end="00:05:19.199" style="s2">good fencers they narrow down to those</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.080" end="00:05:21.680" style="s2">things that actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.199" end="00:05:22.639" style="s2">make sense and so two well-matched</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.680" end="00:05:24.800" style="s2">fencers</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.639" end="00:05:26.080" style="s2">um you know have one kind of battle but</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.800" end="00:05:27.680" style="s2">if you&#39;re just completely arbitrary</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.080" end="00:05:29.680" style="s2">because you&#39;re new to it you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.680" end="00:05:31.520" style="s2">what doesn&#39;t ultimately make sense you</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.680" end="00:05:33.520" style="s2">don&#39;t win against a really good fencer</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.520" end="00:05:35.520" style="s2">but you do score the occasional point</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.520" end="00:05:37.280" style="s2">yeah um so anyway a newbie is</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.520" end="00:05:38.000" style="s2">effectively a generalist an unwitting</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.280" end="00:05:39.440" style="s2">generalist</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.000" end="00:05:41.520" style="s2">to the specialist and this is part of</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.440" end="00:05:43.759" style="s2">also the argument for mma</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.520" end="00:05:44.960" style="s2">over very highly constrained martial</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.759" end="00:05:48.080" style="s2">arts yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.960" end="00:05:49.680" style="s2">yeah um and i think it&#39;s really an</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.080" end="00:05:52.800" style="s2">argument for a lot of things that</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.680" end="00:05:54.240" style="s2">have grasped the public imagination of</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.800" end="00:05:57.280" style="s2">late like</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.240" end="00:05:58.240" style="s2">i must tell you i have very little</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.280" end="00:06:01.280" style="s2">patience</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.240" end="00:06:03.280" style="s2">for olympic gymnastics and now that i</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.280" end="00:06:04.800" style="s2">have access to all sorts of interesting</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.280" end="00:06:06.960" style="s2">parkour to look at</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.800" end="00:06:09.039" style="s2">you know it&#39;s yep much harder to compare</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.960" end="00:06:10.000" style="s2">to parkour performances because they</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.039" end="00:06:12.560" style="s2">don&#39;t take place</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.000" end="00:06:14.080" style="s2">against the same obstacles um but if</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.560" end="00:06:14.639" style="s2">you&#39;re if you&#39;re ready to surrender i</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.080" end="00:06:16.639" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.639" end="00:06:17.840" style="s2">if what you&#39;re trying to do is judge who</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.639" end="00:06:19.600" style="s2">is better it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.840" end="00:06:21.680" style="s2">it&#39;s tougher to control because of what</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.600" end="00:06:24.720" style="s2">it is right yeah and so you know i</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.680" end="00:06:25.919" style="s2">i find the olympic skating and</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.720" end="00:06:27.280" style="s2">gymnastics and all this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.919" end="00:06:29.199" style="s2">mysterious because</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.280" end="00:06:30.720" style="s2">people sit there watching something that</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.199" end="00:06:32.000" style="s2">if they didn&#39;t have the commentary of</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.720" end="00:06:33.280" style="s2">the judges they wouldn&#39;t know what the</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.000" end="00:06:35.919" style="s2">best performance was</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.280" end="00:06:37.360" style="s2">like you could spot an obvious error but</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.919" end="00:06:39.120" style="s2">you don&#39;t really know what the high</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.360" end="00:06:40.800" style="s2">quality performance was whereas</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.120" end="00:06:42.639" style="s2">you do know if you&#39;re impressed at you</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.800" end="00:06:43.520" style="s2">know somebody running up a wall and</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.639" end="00:06:46.000" style="s2">doing a backflip</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.520" end="00:06:47.039" style="s2">exactly um but you know the wall may not</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.000" end="00:06:49.199" style="s2">be consistent right</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.039" end="00:06:52.479" style="s2">one wall is not like another depending</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.199" end="00:06:54.880" style="s2">upon what how slippery it is for example</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.479" end="00:06:57.840" style="s2">um thus introducing into common pilots</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.880" end="00:07:01.120" style="s2">it&#39;s like comparing walls to walls</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.840" end="00:07:02.639" style="s2">wow i&#39;m wondering if that&#39;s really going</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.120" end="00:07:05.599" style="s2">to catch on without it</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.639" end="00:07:06.639" style="s2">i hope not yeah that was that was brett</p>

<p begin="00:07:53.599" end="00:07:56.960" style="s2">and now seems people are intentionally</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.120" end="00:07:58.639" style="s2">consuming entheogens and exploring these</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.960" end="00:08:01.919" style="s2">ideologies in depth</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.639" end="00:08:01.919" style="s2">any thoughts on this</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.599" end="00:08:10.080" style="s2">black indigenous um i would say</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.199" end="00:08:11.039" style="s2">this could be very hopeful if you had</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.080" end="00:08:13.680" style="s2">something like</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.039" end="00:08:14.800" style="s2">a decent guide but if you have</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.680" end="00:08:17.599" style="s2">psychotics</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.800" end="00:08:18.720" style="s2">can we get chloe to lead these just</p>

<p begin="00:08:18.720" end="00:08:22.960" style="s2">just i mean yes chloe would be you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.120" end="00:08:24.400" style="s2">the gold standard but you just need</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.960" end="00:08:26.879" style="s2">somebody sane</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.400" end="00:08:28.080" style="s2">right anybody&#39;s saying can could could</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.879" end="00:08:30.800" style="s2">contribute something but</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.080" end="00:08:32.080" style="s2">you can&#39;t put psychotics in charge of</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.800" end="00:08:35.120" style="s2">guiding other people</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.080" end="00:08:38.240" style="s2">through some trip or it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.120" end="00:08:40.399" style="s2">just amplify the nonsense so i guess</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.240" end="00:08:42.719" style="s2">look i mean yeah i mean god that just it</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.399" end="00:08:45.519" style="s2">sounds if this is being led by the</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.719" end="00:08:47.120" style="s2">standard sort of equity and diversion uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.519" end="00:08:48.320" style="s2">equity and diversity crew</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.120" end="00:08:50.160" style="s2">i think they&#39;re going to prompt a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.320" end="00:08:53.040" style="s2">bad trips i mean that&#39;s just that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.160" end="00:08:53.519" style="s2">that&#39;s not going to be a space in which</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.040" end="00:08:55.040" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.519" end="00:08:56.640" style="s2">actually feel like they can let their</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.040" end="00:08:59.920" style="s2">brain their brains</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.640" end="00:09:02.080" style="s2">wander and and actually explore</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.920" end="00:09:03.920" style="s2">all the different sensory and physical</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.080" end="00:09:04.640" style="s2">stuff that&#39;s coming at them yeah i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.920" end="00:09:06.080" style="s2">trust them</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.640" end="00:09:07.680" style="s2">uh that doesn&#39;t mean i don&#39;t trust these</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.080" end="00:09:08.000" style="s2">people i don&#39;t know who&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.680" end="00:09:09.600" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.000" end="00:09:11.519" style="s2">it but i wouldn&#39;t trust the psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.600" end="00:09:14.399" style="s2">society of san francisco is i think</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.519" end="00:09:15.279" style="s2">uh a long-standing and interesting</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.399" end="00:09:17.440" style="s2">society</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.279" end="00:09:19.760" style="s2">so it does dovetail with another point</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.440" end="00:09:20.560" style="s2">that i used to make frequently which was</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.760" end="00:09:22.560" style="s2">that there is</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.560" end="00:09:23.760" style="s2">actually something tremendously</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.560" end="00:09:27.040" style="s2">disturbing</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.760" end="00:09:27.760" style="s2">about the fact that in some parts of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.040" end="00:09:31.120" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.760" end="00:09:34.320" style="s2">san francisco being primary among them</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.120" end="00:09:36.080" style="s2">and theogens are quasi-legal</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.320" end="00:09:37.760" style="s2">and in other parts of the world like i</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.080" end="00:09:40.399" style="s2">mean decriminalized not</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.760" end="00:09:42.640" style="s2">is that what you mean but my basic point</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.399" end="00:09:46.320" style="s2">is look if the silicon valley crowd</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.640" end="00:09:46.959" style="s2">has access to mushrooms or ayahuasca or</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.320" end="00:09:49.360" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.959" end="00:09:50.160" style="s2">that&#39;s an advantage that is being</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.360" end="00:09:51.839" style="s2">preserved</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.160" end="00:09:53.600" style="s2">by the fact that those very same things</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.839" end="00:09:54.480" style="s2">might be prosecuted in a different</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.600" end="00:09:56.000" style="s2">neighborhood</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.480" end="00:09:57.839" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a privilege you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.000" end="00:10:00.959" style="s2">easy to talk about uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.839" end="00:10:04.399" style="s2">crack versus powder cocaine being uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.959" end="00:10:07.680" style="s2">being effectively having racially</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.399" end="00:10:10.399" style="s2">racially um specific profile</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.680" end="00:10:10.959" style="s2">um what sentencing penalties right uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.399" end="00:10:13.120" style="s2">but this</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.959" end="00:10:14.959" style="s2">idea that this basic side to them right</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.120" end="00:10:17.760" style="s2">that&#39;s like that&#39;s that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.959" end="00:10:18.320" style="s2">nasty but obvious but this sort of uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.760" end="00:10:20.240" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.320" end="00:10:22.000" style="s2">do you even have access to this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.240" end="00:10:23.120" style="s2">thing you and also like just like i said</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.000" end="00:10:24.399" style="s2">like that&#39;s going to prompt a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.120" end="00:10:26.079" style="s2">bad trips</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.399" end="00:10:27.600" style="s2">to really to unless you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.079" end="00:10:29.519" style="s2">micro dosing you need</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.600" end="00:10:30.880" style="s2">some serious time and space and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.519" end="00:10:32.160" style="s2">ability to have some control over your</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.880" end="00:10:34.560" style="s2">surroundings</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.160" end="00:10:35.680" style="s2">to get anywhere close to guaranteeing</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.560" end="00:10:36.720" style="s2">that you&#39;re not going to have a really</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.680" end="00:10:38.720" style="s2">terrible time on it</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.720" end="00:10:40.160" style="s2">yeah but i mean beyond terrible time the</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.720" end="00:10:43.279" style="s2">problem is that this is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.160" end="00:10:45.120" style="s2">mind opening drug and</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.279" end="00:10:46.560" style="s2">because of that it can be open for</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.120" end="00:10:49.920" style="s2">better or for worse</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.560" end="00:10:53.920" style="s2">and what i would say is</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.920" end="00:10:54.959" style="s2">i do think everybody needs equal access</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.920" end="00:10:56.800" style="s2">which means they need to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.959" end="00:10:58.320" style="s2">decriminalized to the same extent</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.800" end="00:11:01.519" style="s2">everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.320" end="00:11:03.440" style="s2">and frankly we&#39;re seeing a mind-numbing</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.519" end="00:11:05.440" style="s2">lack of creativity about</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.440" end="00:11:07.360" style="s2">social problems manifest in this</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.440" end="00:11:09.200" style="s2">movement so could they use some</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.360" end="00:11:11.560" style="s2">shamanistic exploration</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.200" end="00:11:14.079" style="s2">sure but it can&#39;t be just a</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.560" end="00:11:16.320" style="s2">reinforcement of the wrong ideas that we</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.079" end="00:11:17.120" style="s2">are all now being force-fed that will be</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.320" end="00:11:19.440" style="s2">disastrous</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.120" end="00:11:21.360" style="s2">no i mean we&#39;ve talked i specifically</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.440" end="00:11:22.320" style="s2">have talked a lot about how i think that</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.360" end="00:11:23.680" style="s2">most of these people haven&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.320" end="00:11:25.519" style="s2">anywhere they haven&#39;t traveled they</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.680" end="00:11:27.040" style="s2">haven&#39;t actually explored the world</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.519" end="00:11:28.720" style="s2">well that extends to metaphorical as</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.040" end="00:11:30.399" style="s2">well you know they need to open their</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.720" end="00:11:31.839" style="s2">doors of perception somehow</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.399" end="00:11:33.360" style="s2">and perhaps they can do it within their</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.839" end="00:11:34.240" style="s2">own brains perhaps they can do it by</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.360" end="00:11:36.320" style="s2">traveling the world</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.240" end="00:11:37.519" style="s2">perhaps they could do it both ways but</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.320" end="00:11:41.360" style="s2">absent any</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.519" end="00:11:42.000" style="s2">such expansion of their very narrow</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.360" end="00:11:44.320" style="s2">model of</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.000" end="00:11:45.839" style="s2">what&#39;s right and what&#39;s okay they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.320" end="00:11:49.600" style="s2">only going to get more ideological</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.839" end="00:11:53.120" style="s2">yep now there is um</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.600" end="00:11:54.720" style="s2">one thing again i i think the danger of</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.120" end="00:11:56.880" style="s2">botching this in the current environment</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.720" end="00:11:59.200" style="s2">is great but um</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.880" end="00:12:00.560" style="s2">there&#39;s one thing that entheogens will</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.200" end="00:12:03.120" style="s2">teach you that i think</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.560" end="00:12:04.160" style="s2">is actually a vital lesson to getting</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.120" end="00:12:07.760" style="s2">past this</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.160" end="00:12:11.440" style="s2">this uh this woke nonsense which is</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.760" end="00:12:12.240" style="s2">that your perception can absolutely lie</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.440" end="00:12:16.000" style="s2">to you</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.240" end="00:12:17.839" style="s2">right so you know good advice for people</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.000" end="00:12:21.440" style="s2">experimenting with entheogens</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.839" end="00:12:23.360" style="s2">who don&#39;t have prior experience is</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.440" end="00:12:24.480" style="s2">you probably want to stay away from the</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.360" end="00:12:27.120" style="s2">mirror</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.480" end="00:12:30.000" style="s2">and you want to stay away from the phone</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.120" end="00:12:32.560" style="s2">and that&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.000" end="00:12:35.040" style="s2">it can be very unsettling an encounter</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.560" end="00:12:36.480" style="s2">on the phone you&#39;re liable to do</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.040" end="00:12:38.079" style="s2">harm if the person on the other end</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.480" end="00:12:40.560" style="s2">doesn&#39;t know what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.079" end="00:12:41.519" style="s2">up to and have experienced themself</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.560" end="00:12:44.000" style="s2">somebody who</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.519" end="00:12:46.320" style="s2">did could handle it but you&#39;re liable</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.000" end="00:12:48.480" style="s2">not to be able to navigate a phone call</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.320" end="00:12:50.839" style="s2">and the mirror you know watching you</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.480" end="00:12:53.839" style="s2">know your face melt</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.839" end="00:12:54.399" style="s2">right that&#39;s not such an easy thing to</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.839" end="00:12:56.399" style="s2">handle</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.399" end="00:12:57.920" style="s2">away from the rest of you right exactly</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.399" end="00:13:01.519" style="s2">on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.920" end="00:13:04.560" style="s2">wow how useful is it to have evidence</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.519" end="00:13:06.240" style="s2">my what i think is my eyes</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.560" end="00:13:08.399" style="s2">just lied to me because i know that</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.240" end="00:13:10.240" style="s2">didn&#39;t happen right i can verify that</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.399" end="00:13:12.880" style="s2">the skin is still on my face</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.240" end="00:13:14.320" style="s2">therefore my eyes are not as reliable as</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.880" end="00:13:15.839" style="s2">i interpret them to be under normal</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.320" end="00:13:17.519" style="s2">circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.839" end="00:13:20.160" style="s2">so what you&#39;re saying is basically it</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.519" end="00:13:23.040" style="s2">can be used as a skepticism enhancer</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.160" end="00:13:23.600" style="s2">if you&#39;re paying attention it will cause</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.040" end="00:13:26.320" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.600" end="00:13:26.800" style="s2">to understand that your your perceptions</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.320" end="00:13:29.519" style="s2">can be</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.800" end="00:13:31.440" style="s2">anything up through an outright lie and</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.519" end="00:13:32.240" style="s2">one that is not detectable on visual</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.440" end="00:13:34.320" style="s2">grounds</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.240" end="00:13:36.320" style="s2">and so um to the extent that we are</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.320" end="00:13:38.480" style="s2">facing something that seems an awful lot</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.320" end="00:13:40.959" style="s2">like psychosis getting people to say</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.480" end="00:13:42.160" style="s2">you know am i having a psychotic break</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.959" end="00:13:43.360" style="s2">that would be a step in the right</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.160" end="00:13:44.560" style="s2">direction because</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.360" end="00:13:48.000" style="s2">you might be having something that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.560" end="00:13:49.680" style="s2">lot like one yeah very good</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.000" end="00:13:51.760" style="s2">you both are a sanctuary in a sea of</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.680" end="00:13:53.760" style="s2">madness supposedly</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.760" end="00:13:55.600" style="s2">99 of all species that ever lived are</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.760" end="00:13:57.040" style="s2">extinct does this imply that most</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.600" end="00:13:59.120" style="s2">species are dead ends</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.040" end="00:14:00.880" style="s2">like the dodo or that we inflate the</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.120" end="00:14:03.360" style="s2">statistic by including all ancestral</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.880" end="00:14:07.680" style="s2">species of descendant species</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.360" end="00:14:09.199" style="s2">both both the latter is trivial i think</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.680" end="00:14:10.959" style="s2">the latter is trivial but it&#39;s true and</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.199" end="00:14:13.680" style="s2">it&#39;s worth you know it&#39;s it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.959" end="00:14:14.800" style="s2">noting that apparently given what i</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.680" end="00:14:16.160" style="s2">revealed last hour you know many</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.800" end="00:14:18.000" style="s2">biologists don&#39;t seem to understand</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.160" end="00:14:20.000" style="s2">what the fact that we can&#39;t decide in a</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.000" end="00:14:23.120" style="s2">single species concepts means</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.000" end="00:14:25.279" style="s2">like that the the the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.120" end="00:14:26.959" style="s2">the paleontological species concept</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.279" end="00:14:30.399" style="s2">which names species</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.959" end="00:14:32.240" style="s2">in uh within lineage different names</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.399" end="00:14:33.440" style="s2">so we are given just take the example</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.240" end="00:14:34.000" style="s2">that most people will be familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.440" end="00:14:36.160" style="s2">humans</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.000" end="00:14:38.160" style="s2">right we have several australopithecus</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.160" end="00:14:40.160" style="s2">species and then several homo species</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.160" end="00:14:41.839" style="s2">um some of which are slight branches off</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.160" end="00:14:42.320" style="s2">of our lineage but many of which are</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.839" end="00:14:43.680" style="s2">within</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.320" end="00:14:46.000" style="s2">our direct lineage and they all have</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.680" end="00:14:49.120" style="s2">different names and</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.000" end="00:14:51.839" style="s2">that is a way for paleontologists um</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.120" end="00:14:53.040" style="s2">to to talk to each other just to just to</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.839" end="00:14:55.760" style="s2">know what they&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.040" end="00:14:57.600" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t pretend that those that</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.760" end="00:14:59.680" style="s2">you know one didn&#39;t become the next</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.600" end="00:15:00.880" style="s2">but it&#39;s very confusing especially when</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.680" end="00:15:02.880" style="s2">um you know most of us</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.880" end="00:15:04.720" style="s2">most non-biologists and in fact most</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.880" end="00:15:05.440" style="s2">biologists just have implicit in their</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.720" end="00:15:06.959" style="s2">brains</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.440" end="00:15:08.880" style="s2">what&#39;s called the biological species</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.959" end="00:15:10.720" style="s2">concept which is that if it can</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.880" end="00:15:12.399" style="s2">you know if two animals can reproduce</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.720" end="00:15:14.079" style="s2">and make viable offspring then it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.399" end="00:15:15.440" style="s2">species and if they can&#39;t then it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.079" end="00:15:17.839" style="s2">different species</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.440" end="00:15:19.920" style="s2">and that&#39;s you know that&#39;s one of gosh</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.839" end="00:15:20.240" style="s2">hundreds of species concepts and none</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.920" end="00:15:23.120" style="s2">will</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.240" end="00:15:24.880" style="s2">apply to all but this this</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.120" end="00:15:25.600" style="s2">paleontological species concept does</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.880" end="00:15:28.720" style="s2">contribute</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.600" end="00:15:30.880" style="s2">slightly to the idea that some species</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.720" end="00:15:32.399" style="s2">um are extinct now just because they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.880" end="00:15:34.160" style="s2">been replaced by new ones with a</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.399" end="00:15:35.680" style="s2">different name which isn&#39;t which isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.160" end="00:15:38.480" style="s2">good definition of species well</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.680" end="00:15:40.160" style="s2">it&#39;s it worse worse than the problem</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.480" end="00:15:41.920" style="s2">with species is the uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.160" end="00:15:43.199" style="s2">implication of extinction because to</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.920" end="00:15:46.480" style="s2">evolve into something different is</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.199" end="00:15:48.800" style="s2">not at all extinct exactly um yes but</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.480" end="00:15:50.880" style="s2">in any case here&#39;s the thing so i would</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.800" end="00:15:52.480" style="s2">say first of all if you got rid of that</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.880" end="00:15:54.000" style="s2">ambiguity you would still have the same</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.480" end="00:15:55.440" style="s2">overwhelming pattern and yes it does</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.000" end="00:15:57.279" style="s2">mean that the majority of species are</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.440" end="00:15:59.040" style="s2">dead ends which does not mean as much as</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.279" end="00:16:00.959" style="s2">we think because</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.040" end="00:16:02.560" style="s2">if so this goes into what i&#39;ve called</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.959" end="00:16:03.120" style="s2">explorer modes and i&#39;ve taken no end of</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.560" end="00:16:04.639" style="s2">crap</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.120" end="00:16:06.160" style="s2">about which is fine because i will turn</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.639" end="00:16:09.040" style="s2">out to be right in the end</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.160" end="00:16:09.920" style="s2">but um the thing is if you imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.040" end="00:16:11.759" style="s2">a clade</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.920" end="00:16:13.440" style="s2">that is to say a cluster of closely</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.759" end="00:16:15.680" style="s2">related critters</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.440" end="00:16:17.040" style="s2">is actually exploring the various</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.680" end="00:16:19.839" style="s2">possible ways to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.040" end="00:16:21.440" style="s2">and that one of those explorations</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.839" end="00:16:22.480" style="s2">actually results in the discovery of</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.440" end="00:16:24.959" style="s2">something new</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.480" end="00:16:26.560" style="s2">that is not a failure of the clade even</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.959" end="00:16:28.079" style="s2">though the clade may get edited down to</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.560" end="00:16:28.800" style="s2">a tiny fraction of the various</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.079" end="00:16:30.320" style="s2">experiments</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.800" end="00:16:32.320" style="s2">so it would be great if we had visuals</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.320" end="00:16:34.720" style="s2">here but so you had species a</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.320" end="00:16:36.560" style="s2">and it radiated into b and c and b and c</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.720" end="00:16:38.000" style="s2">radiated into d and e and f and g and</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.560" end="00:16:41.680" style="s2">all of this and you had species b</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.000" end="00:16:44.880" style="s2">through z all of which were uh</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.680" end="00:16:48.720" style="s2">were descendants of species a if</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.880" end="00:16:50.399" style="s2">species b say ends up going on</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.720" end="00:16:52.000" style="s2">and and its descendants do but</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.399" end="00:16:53.360" style="s2">everything on the other half of the tree</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.000" end="00:16:56.079" style="s2">goes extinct</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.360" end="00:16:57.040" style="s2">uh that still leaves half of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.079" end="00:16:59.440" style="s2">representatives</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.040" end="00:17:00.959" style="s2">of of the original most recent common</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.440" end="00:17:03.519" style="s2">ancestor of those species</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.959" end="00:17:04.559" style="s2">um with representation in the world</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.519" end="00:17:06.000" style="s2">right and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.559" end="00:17:08.480" style="s2">the thing that we have said probably</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.000" end="00:17:10.000" style="s2">sometimes with an actual tree</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.480" end="00:17:12.160" style="s2">doing it with the hands is not good we</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.000" end="00:17:14.559" style="s2">have a vermilion yes we do</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.160" end="00:17:16.079" style="s2">and we have uh succulents from someone</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.559" end="00:17:18.959" style="s2">who sent them to us who grows them from</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.079" end="00:17:22.000" style="s2">seeds in arizona thank you um but</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.959" end="00:17:23.679" style="s2">the uh the question is how do you get</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.000" end="00:17:25.760" style="s2">into the future</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.679" end="00:17:27.679" style="s2">not what you get into the future as</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.760" end="00:17:29.919" style="s2">we&#39;re very focused on what you are</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.679" end="00:17:30.799" style="s2">yeah but selection isn&#39;t and so here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.919" end="00:17:33.679" style="s2">the final</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.799" end="00:17:34.000" style="s2">cherry on top of this whole thing you</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.679" end="00:17:36.320" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.000" end="00:17:37.600" style="s2">every other living entity that you can</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.320" end="00:17:41.360" style="s2">point to</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.600" end="00:17:44.640" style="s2">is the result of an unbroken</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.360" end="00:17:48.000" style="s2">three and a half billion year stretch</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.640" end="00:17:51.200" style="s2">of reproduction that never once</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.000" end="00:17:52.240" style="s2">failed okay that is to say generation</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.200" end="00:17:54.960" style="s2">after generation</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.240" end="00:17:56.320" style="s2">for three and a half billion years your</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.960" end="00:17:58.559" style="s2">ancestors never once</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.320" end="00:17:59.440" style="s2">failed to make the jump even though</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.559" end="00:18:01.360" style="s2">almost</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.440" end="00:18:02.880" style="s2">everyone fails to make the jump within a</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.360" end="00:18:04.960" style="s2">generation or two of existing</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.880" end="00:18:06.480" style="s2">and you probably will as well but the</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.960" end="00:18:09.520" style="s2">point is</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.480" end="00:18:12.480" style="s2">selection is the result</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.520" end="00:18:13.440" style="s2">of that weird comparison between the odd</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.480" end="00:18:15.200" style="s2">creature</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.440" end="00:18:17.520" style="s2">that never once in three and a half</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.200" end="00:18:19.440" style="s2">billion years ever failed to reproduce</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.520" end="00:18:21.360" style="s2">right and all of the other creatures</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.440" end="00:18:22.880" style="s2">which were much closer to the normal</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.360" end="00:18:24.320" style="s2">expectation which is to say failure</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.880" end="00:18:26.960" style="s2">within a few generations</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.320" end="00:18:28.080" style="s2">so that fact of being in the camp that</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.960" end="00:18:30.240" style="s2">never once failed</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.080" end="00:18:31.760" style="s2">is selection if you squint at it just</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.240" end="00:18:34.080" style="s2">right and it explains</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.760" end="00:18:34.960" style="s2">why this is such a powerful process what</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.080" end="00:18:37.840" style="s2">does it say</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.960" end="00:18:39.840" style="s2">to be in the tiny group of never failed</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.840" end="00:18:40.799" style="s2">rather than the massive group of faileds</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.840" end="00:18:42.720" style="s2">as normal</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.799" end="00:18:44.640" style="s2">right it&#39;s it means you got all of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.720" end="00:18:45.600" style="s2">stuff that works and even that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.640" end="00:18:47.200" style="s2">good enough to get you</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.600" end="00:18:49.360" style="s2">three more generations forward in all</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.200" end="00:18:51.679" style="s2">probability so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.360" end="00:18:52.400" style="s2">it&#39;s a very interesting odd landscape</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.679" end="00:18:54.080" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.400" end="00:18:56.880" style="s2">well worth considering yeah tremendously</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.080" end="00:18:58.720" style="s2">fun to play around in</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.880" end="00:19:00.000" style="s2">this is just a recommendation i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.720" end="00:19:02.160" style="s2">recognize it but i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.000" end="00:19:03.039" style="s2">read the comment regarding psychopathy</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.160" end="00:19:06.080" style="s2">and politics</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.039" end="00:19:07.679" style="s2">have you read political ponerology</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.080" end="00:19:09.600" style="s2">the original manuscript went into the</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.679" end="00:19:11.760" style="s2">furnace minutes before a secret police</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.600" end="00:19:13.520" style="s2">raid in communist poland</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.760" end="00:19:16.080" style="s2">sounds fascinating and neither of us are</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.520" end="00:19:18.000" style="s2">familiar with it presumably a copy</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.080" end="00:19:19.600" style="s2">was preserved yeah i know it&#39;s all up</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.000" end="00:19:23.039" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.600" end="00:19:24.720" style="s2">i&#39;m interested to read this yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.039" end="00:19:26.720" style="s2">and the next one is also a comment i</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.720" end="00:19:28.880" style="s2">just listened to the billie holiday</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.720" end="00:19:31.440" style="s2">just listened to billie holiday singing</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.880" end="00:19:34.880" style="s2">god bless the child who&#39;s got his own</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.440" end="00:19:35.440" style="s2">game theory 101. yeah be easier if it</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.880" end="00:19:38.559" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.440" end="00:19:41.440" style="s2">god blessed the child that got his own</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.559" end="00:19:42.960" style="s2">or who&#39;s got his arm isn&#39;t i mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.440" end="00:19:45.679" style="s2">not the implication of the song</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.960" end="00:19:46.880" style="s2">well it could be taken yeah as the</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.679" end="00:19:48.960" style="s2">matthew effect</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.880" end="00:19:50.080" style="s2">in other words the child that that has</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.960" end="00:19:52.160" style="s2">got his own</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.080" end="00:19:53.760" style="s2">is going to be blessed by god going</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.160" end="00:19:56.799" style="s2">forward which is also</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.760" end="00:19:57.840" style="s2">likely true yeah but anyway interesting</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.799" end="00:20:00.000" style="s2">question i would have to go back and</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.840" end="00:20:03.360" style="s2">listen to the lyrics specifically</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.000" end="00:20:07.520" style="s2">but my guess is um</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.360" end="00:20:09.200" style="s2">it is uh it is the</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.520" end="00:20:10.960" style="s2">latter interpretation and not the former</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.200" end="00:20:13.280" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.960" end="00:20:14.880" style="s2">the dismissal of racism as evil seems</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.280" end="00:20:16.159" style="s2">like a missed opportunity to discuss the</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.880" end="00:20:17.919" style="s2">recognition of differences both</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.159" end="00:20:19.440" style="s2">historically and presently</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.919" end="00:20:20.799" style="s2">how would you teach kids this awareness</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.440" end="00:20:22.400" style="s2">of differences with an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.799" end="00:20:24.400" style="s2">framing</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.400" end="00:20:26.159" style="s2">i mean we did this is exactly what we</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.400" end="00:20:28.080" style="s2">did in our classes we did not pretend</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.159" end="00:20:29.280" style="s2">that these things didn&#39;t exist we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.080" end="00:20:30.240" style="s2">pretend that the histories were other</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.280" end="00:20:32.000" style="s2">than they were</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.240" end="00:20:34.159" style="s2">and everybody brought whatever</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.000" end="00:20:36.240" style="s2">experiences in history they had with</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.159" end="00:20:40.559" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.240" end="00:20:43.840" style="s2">we discussed them openly and you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.559" end="00:20:45.840" style="s2">too little is made of the covenants both</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.840" end="00:20:47.520" style="s2">formal and informal that we had in our</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.840" end="00:20:49.039" style="s2">classes so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.520" end="00:20:50.720" style="s2">interesting things so i mean that word</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.039" end="00:20:52.159" style="s2">needs defining that a lot of what</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.720" end="00:20:53.120" style="s2">happened at evergreen was in religious</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.159" end="00:20:55.440" style="s2">language which is</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.120" end="00:20:57.280" style="s2">maybe telling yeah but we were required</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.440" end="00:20:59.600" style="s2">to have formal covenants</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.280" end="00:21:00.400" style="s2">uh with our students um that we wrote</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.600" end="00:21:02.320" style="s2">and uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.400" end="00:21:03.919" style="s2">that established what their obligations</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.320" end="00:21:04.720" style="s2">to us were what our obligations to them</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.919" end="00:21:06.880" style="s2">were</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.720" end="00:21:07.760" style="s2">what to do in case of grievance etc and</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.880" end="00:21:10.080" style="s2">then they had to</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.760" end="00:21:11.360" style="s2">sign them or you know implicitly agree</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.080" end="00:21:12.720" style="s2">to them if they stayed in the program</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.360" end="00:21:14.159" style="s2">and they could this was required by</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.720" end="00:21:16.480" style="s2">evergreen it was required by evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.159" end="00:21:18.240" style="s2">for every program</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.480" end="00:21:20.880" style="s2">most of the ones that i saw and every</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.240" end="00:21:23.039" style="s2">time you taught with somebody who</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.880" end="00:21:24.000" style="s2">uh at any time you talked with somebody</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.039" end="00:21:25.840" style="s2">you had to</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.000" end="00:21:27.200" style="s2">co-fashion a covenant so you got to see</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.840" end="00:21:29.520" style="s2">the covenants that they typically use</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.200" end="00:21:32.799" style="s2">they saw yours and you combined them</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.520" end="00:21:36.480" style="s2">and everyone that i saw short of hours</p>

<p begin="00:22:13.039" end="00:22:18.240" style="s2">we included stuff about how specifically</p>

<p begin="00:22:29.360" end="00:22:33.760" style="s2">what it sounded like i meant oh cat has</p>

<p begin="00:22:36.880" end="00:22:40.400" style="s2">uh you had the right to take it back to</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.600" end="00:22:43.679" style="s2">apologize</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.400" end="00:22:47.360" style="s2">oh you can&#39;t do this no</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.679" end="00:22:50.640" style="s2">dude that&#39;s just wrong um</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.360" end="00:22:52.960" style="s2">not okay but anyway uh the</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.640" end="00:22:55.120" style="s2">the mechanisms for dealing with offense</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.960" end="00:22:56.480" style="s2">without causing a catastrophe were built</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.120" end="00:22:58.640" style="s2">into the structures that we were using</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.480" end="00:23:00.400" style="s2">as you know that&#39;s the point</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.640" end="00:23:02.080" style="s2">and um were you going to say anything</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.400" end="00:23:03.440" style="s2">specific about</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.080" end="00:23:05.280" style="s2">awareness of differences i mean i guess</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.440" end="00:23:08.880" style="s2">we did that in the classroom</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.280" end="00:23:11.280" style="s2">rather than in the covenant such that</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.880" end="00:23:12.000" style="s2">um you know i in in some of my types of</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.280" end="00:23:14.400" style="s2">programs</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.000" end="00:23:15.840" style="s2">i would say in the preamble basically</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.400" end="00:23:16.799" style="s2">both of us had so many</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.840" end="00:23:18.320" style="s2">students who wanted to get into the</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.799" end="00:23:19.440" style="s2">programs that we were trying to scare</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.320" end="00:23:20.720" style="s2">people away so that we</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.440" end="00:23:22.080" style="s2">were left with the ones who were just</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.720" end="00:23:23.760" style="s2">trying to scare the people away who were</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.080" end="00:23:25.600" style="s2">most likely to yeah we were trying to</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.760" end="00:23:27.440" style="s2">disrupt we wanted the most anti-fragile</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.600" end="00:23:29.760" style="s2">students the ones who</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.440" end="00:23:30.960" style="s2">may maybe they had no background at all</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.760" end="00:23:32.640" style="s2">even in an upper division science</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.960" end="00:23:34.240" style="s2">program that was totally fine</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.640" end="00:23:36.480" style="s2">but if they were going to require a</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.240" end="00:23:38.000" style="s2">certain kind of uh</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.480" end="00:23:40.240" style="s2">thing that they&#39;d always had before in</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.000" end="00:23:42.640" style="s2">school or i require that they</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.240" end="00:23:44.080" style="s2">had their hands held while if their if</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.640" end="00:23:46.320" style="s2">their feelings were hurt then</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.080" end="00:23:47.360" style="s2">um that was that was much tougher to</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.320" end="00:23:51.039" style="s2">have in the classroom</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.360" end="00:23:53.360" style="s2">right um so i would say i guess it was</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.039" end="00:23:55.360" style="s2">in my animal behavior programs uh which</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.360" end="00:23:56.799" style="s2">some version of which we then taught</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.360" end="00:23:58.000" style="s2">together in our final study abroad</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.799" end="00:24:00.159" style="s2">program</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.000" end="00:24:01.840" style="s2">um we&#39;re going to be talking about</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.159" end="00:24:03.440" style="s2">difficult things like the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.840" end="00:24:05.600" style="s2">underpinnings of genocide and</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.440" end="00:24:06.799" style="s2">rape and we&#39;re not going to justify any</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.600" end="00:24:09.919" style="s2">of that</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.799" end="00:24:11.919" style="s2">but if even getting near those topics is</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.919" end="00:24:13.600" style="s2">going to make you so uncomfortable that</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.919" end="00:24:15.279" style="s2">you can&#39;t conceive of a scientific</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.600" end="00:24:17.120" style="s2">discussion on such topics you should</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.279" end="00:24:19.200" style="s2">probably find someplace else to go</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.120" end="00:24:20.480" style="s2">and you know to their credit i had some</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.200" end="00:24:22.080" style="s2">students who were like oh that is going</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.480" end="00:24:23.360" style="s2">to make me nervous but i&#39;ve got to stick</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.080" end="00:24:25.679" style="s2">around and see what that looks like</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.360" end="00:24:26.799" style="s2">yep and that those were often the most</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.679" end="00:24:28.159" style="s2">the bravest</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.799" end="00:24:30.240" style="s2">ultimately and the ones who learned the</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.159" end="00:24:33.360" style="s2">most so i have a uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.240" end="00:24:35.279" style="s2">an anecdote i&#39;m be very careful um</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.360" end="00:24:36.720" style="s2">to protect the young woman in question</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.279" end="00:24:40.640" style="s2">but yeah i had a student</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.720" end="00:24:44.080" style="s2">in my first or second year teaching</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.640" end="00:24:47.919" style="s2">who um had been</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.080" end="00:24:51.039" style="s2">violently attacked on a study abroad</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.919" end="00:24:52.799" style="s2">program attacked by locals not people on</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.039" end="00:24:56.240" style="s2">the trip</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.799" end="00:24:56.880" style="s2">she had been raped and i warned her</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.240" end="00:25:00.159" style="s2">about the</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.880" end="00:25:01.120" style="s2">topics in the class and very much to her</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.159" end="00:25:04.400" style="s2">credit</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.120" end="00:25:05.679" style="s2">her sense was no i i have to i have to</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.400" end="00:25:08.159" style="s2">hear what you have to say</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.679" end="00:25:10.320" style="s2">and then she actually did a project and</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.159" end="00:25:11.600" style="s2">wrote a paper on the exact topic of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.320" end="00:25:13.279" style="s2">evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.600" end="00:25:15.760" style="s2">meaning of rape which is not an easy</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.279" end="00:25:19.360" style="s2">topic for any of us to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.760" end="00:25:24.000" style="s2">and i was just so deeply impressed with</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.360" end="00:25:25.919" style="s2">her courage and her ability to actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.000" end="00:25:27.440" style="s2">carry it off to understand and you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.919" end="00:25:28.799" style="s2">it was clearly something she needed to</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.440" end="00:25:30.799" style="s2">do to heal but</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.799" end="00:25:32.240" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t you know she didn&#39;t tell</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.799" end="00:25:32.559" style="s2">herself some story that she wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.240" end="00:25:35.200" style="s2">hear</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.559" end="00:25:36.080" style="s2">she confronted it full strength and</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.200" end="00:25:37.600" style="s2">anyway</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.080" end="00:25:39.600" style="s2">and did you do you think that it was</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.600" end="00:25:39.919" style="s2">healing for her i have no question about</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.600" end="00:25:41.440" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.919" end="00:25:42.799" style="s2">no question about it in fact we talked</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.440" end="00:25:44.159" style="s2">about it you know that&#39;s another thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.799" end="00:25:46.400" style="s2">that evergreen did well</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.159" end="00:25:48.480" style="s2">was uh we spent a lot of time with</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.400" end="00:25:50.080" style="s2">students one-on-one in small groups</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.480" end="00:25:52.320" style="s2">around campfires at the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.080" end="00:25:53.679" style="s2">program uh you sit down with them and</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.320" end="00:25:56.720" style="s2">you have a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.679" end="00:25:57.520" style="s2">one-on-one yeah um so i know exactly</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.720" end="00:26:00.960" style="s2">what she thought</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.520" end="00:26:02.640" style="s2">and uh it was it was</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.960" end="00:26:04.720" style="s2">exactly what you would have hoped and it</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.640" end="00:26:05.520" style="s2">is exactly the opposite message of this</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.720" end="00:26:09.360" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.520" end="00:26:11.200" style="s2">trigger warning safe space uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.360" end="00:26:12.880" style="s2">keep every wound open because it&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.200" end="00:26:15.200" style="s2">most valuable feature</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.880" end="00:26:16.000" style="s2">it was the opposite of that and uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.200" end="00:26:18.000" style="s2">anyway so</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.000" end="00:26:20.240" style="s2">with with your program and by</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.000" end="00:26:22.000" style="s2">introducing her to</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.240" end="00:26:24.000" style="s2">what you taught her and by giving her</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.000" end="00:26:26.400" style="s2">forum to write that you allowed her to</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.000" end="00:26:27.360" style="s2">move her wound into becoming a scar scar</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.400" end="00:26:31.760" style="s2">yeah and i</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.360" end="00:26:35.120" style="s2">uh i have no doubt that it was a</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.760" end="00:26:37.520" style="s2">major contributor to her quality of life</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.120" end="00:26:38.720" style="s2">going forward anyway if she&#39;s out there</p>

<p begin="00:27:02.720" end="00:27:06.320" style="s2">they defy rebuttal that is exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.880" end="00:27:07.600" style="s2">they do that is the only thing that they</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.320" end="00:27:10.720" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.600" end="00:27:12.720" style="s2">well in this case there is</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.720" end="00:27:13.919" style="s2">certainly a true interpretation of that</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.720" end="00:27:15.919" style="s2">statement</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.919" end="00:27:16.960" style="s2">okay so a concise rebuttal may involve</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.919" end="00:27:19.440" style="s2">first steel manning</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.960" end="00:27:20.960" style="s2">right okay are there well in the case</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.440" end="00:27:24.159" style="s2">that there is racism</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.960" end="00:27:26.480" style="s2">denial of it does preserve it right sure</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.159" end="00:27:29.440" style="s2">collective denial of it even worse</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.480" end="00:27:31.840" style="s2">um that however does not it needs it</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.440" end="00:27:34.640" style="s2">needs a preamble where racism exists</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.840" end="00:27:36.559" style="s2">denial makes it stronger right but the</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.640" end="00:27:39.440" style="s2">denial that there is racism somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.559" end="00:27:40.640" style="s2">does not imply that it exists which is</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.440" end="00:27:42.880" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.640" end="00:27:44.880" style="s2">what happened at evergreen and is now</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.880" end="00:27:47.279" style="s2">happening in public which is not to say</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.880" end="00:27:49.360" style="s2">that there is no racism but you know the</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.279" end="00:27:52.960" style="s2">allegation that there is white supremacy</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.360" end="00:27:55.279" style="s2">rampant at evergreen no</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.960" end="00:27:56.000" style="s2">not white supremacy right you could have</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.279" end="00:27:59.120" style="s2">ignorance</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.000" end="00:28:02.000" style="s2">but no this was a community that was</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.120" end="00:28:03.840" style="s2">very eager to make sure that these</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.000" end="00:28:05.679" style="s2">properties didn&#39;t exist there so</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.840" end="00:28:07.679" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t mean it wasn&#39;t inept but</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.679" end="00:28:08.880" style="s2">white supremacy is the wrong diagnosis</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.679" end="00:28:10.799" style="s2">but i think i mean i think you actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.880" end="00:28:11.440" style="s2">came up with the answer here or we did</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.799" end="00:28:13.679" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.440" end="00:28:14.480" style="s2">looking for a concise rebuttal to this</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.679" end="00:28:16.799" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.480" end="00:28:18.000" style="s2">where racism exists denial makes it</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.799" end="00:28:20.880" style="s2">stronger</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.000" end="00:28:23.039" style="s2">but denying that racism exists does not</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.880" end="00:28:25.440" style="s2">prove the existence of racism</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.039" end="00:28:26.799" style="s2">nor is it racism as we were that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.440" end="00:28:28.000" style="s2">that&#39;s also true there&#39;s a lot more that</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.799" end="00:28:28.559" style="s2">you can be said but in terms of a</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.000" end="00:28:31.840" style="s2">concise</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.559" end="00:28:33.520" style="s2">like two sentence like deal with that</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.840" end="00:28:36.000" style="s2">now okay you gave me three words</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.520" end="00:28:38.000" style="s2">you sign on a church or whatever it was</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.000" end="00:28:41.200" style="s2">um i&#39;m gonna give you two sentences and</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.000" end="00:28:43.360" style="s2">make sure he&#39;s gonna squeak um and</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.200" end="00:28:45.120" style="s2">see you know see what happens next well</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.360" end="00:28:47.600" style="s2">i don&#39;t know why you&#39;re so eager</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.120" end="00:28:49.120" style="s2">to make this concise response short i</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.600" end="00:28:51.120" style="s2">just seems like we could</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.120" end="00:28:52.799" style="s2">attack stuff onto it and certainly</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.120" end="00:28:56.000" style="s2">couldn&#39;t really turn it into something</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.799" end="00:28:57.600" style="s2">yes here we see you know one of one of</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.000" end="00:28:58.080" style="s2">the other things about evergreen was we</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.600" end="00:28:59.760" style="s2">had like</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.080" end="00:29:01.200" style="s2">three hour blocks to do lectures in and</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.760" end="00:29:02.960" style="s2">they were meandering</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.200" end="00:29:04.799" style="s2">and they they were wonderful you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.960" end="00:29:06.559" style="s2">that sounds awful if you&#39;ve been in</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.799" end="00:29:08.000" style="s2">almost any lecture how can you expect</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.559" end="00:29:09.760" style="s2">people to keep their butts on seats for</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.000" end="00:29:11.520" style="s2">that long it&#39;s terrible</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.760" end="00:29:12.960" style="s2">but these were very much back and forth</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.520" end="00:29:15.120" style="s2">interactive</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.960" end="00:29:16.559" style="s2">explorations and so we&#39;re used to having</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.120" end="00:29:19.679" style="s2">rather a lot more time</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.559" end="00:29:21.200" style="s2">yes than we can here and also having</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.679" end="00:29:22.640" style="s2">actual people to interact with besides</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.200" end="00:29:25.039" style="s2">ourselves</p>

<p begin="00:30:30.799" end="00:30:35.679" style="s2">perhaps were actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.240" end="00:30:39.120" style="s2">uh bad in this regard and uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.679" end="00:30:41.120" style="s2">made the uh made</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.120" end="00:30:42.880" style="s2">american science stronger by virtue</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.120" end="00:30:45.919" style="s2">having stolen their brains from germany</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.880" end="00:30:49.279" style="s2">yeah and i remember from youth um a</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.919" end="00:30:52.720" style="s2">tom lehrer song about werner von braun</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.279" end="00:30:54.399" style="s2">that&#39;s right who uh had claimed</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.720" end="00:30:56.000" style="s2">that once the rockets were up who cares</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.399" end="00:30:56.640" style="s2">where they come down that&#39;s not my</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.000" end="00:30:59.120" style="s2">department</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.640" end="00:31:01.279" style="s2">said verner von braun but um but anyway</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.120" end="00:31:03.519" style="s2">yeah so the evolved implications though</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.279" end="00:31:05.440" style="s2">the evolved implica well the evolved</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.519" end="00:31:08.480" style="s2">implications</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.440" end="00:31:09.519" style="s2">are that there is murky game theory</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.480" end="00:31:12.720" style="s2">under all of this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.519" end="00:31:16.279" style="s2">and the question is do you</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.720" end="00:31:17.519" style="s2">um are you going to banish the</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.279" end="00:31:20.480" style="s2">conclusions</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.519" end="00:31:21.279" style="s2">in neurobiology for example that were</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.480" end="00:31:23.279" style="s2">discovered</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.279" end="00:31:24.880" style="s2">as a result of people getting parts of</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.279" end="00:31:26.640" style="s2">their head blown off</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.880" end="00:31:28.240" style="s2">and us discovering therefore what</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.640" end="00:31:31.279" style="s2">controlled what</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.240" end="00:31:35.200" style="s2">just because people getting their heads</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.279" end="00:31:36.559" style="s2">uh blown off is grotesque um</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.200" end="00:31:38.480" style="s2">so anyway i don&#39;t know what there is to</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.559" end="00:31:39.279" style="s2">say except that well one one thing that</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.480" end="00:31:41.120" style="s2">might be</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.279" end="00:31:42.559" style="s2">implied in the question which we would</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.120" end="00:31:44.080" style="s2">just disagree with i&#39;m not i&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.559" end="00:31:46.000" style="s2">it&#39;s in this question but one thing that</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.080" end="00:31:46.399" style="s2">i see is a possible implication here is</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.000" end="00:31:50.480" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.399" end="00:31:52.799" style="s2">um those uh nazi germans</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.480" end="00:31:54.559" style="s2">who were pulled into u.s science and</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.799" end="00:31:57.440" style="s2">therefore and thereafter became</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.559" end="00:31:58.399" style="s2">uh part of u.s society and i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.440" end="00:32:00.240" style="s2">actually but probably</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.399" end="00:32:02.399" style="s2">intermarried and had kids here would</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.240" end="00:32:04.399" style="s2">they be more likely to make nazis</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.399" end="00:32:06.880" style="s2">not genetically there is no reason to</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.399" end="00:32:10.240" style="s2">expect that you know nazism is</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.880" end="00:32:14.399" style="s2">is genetic but culturally</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.240" end="00:32:17.279" style="s2">would those ideas have potentially had</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.399" end="00:32:18.559" style="s2">greater reach here because there were</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.279" end="00:32:20.320" style="s2">actual people who</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.559" end="00:32:22.240" style="s2">held under those beliefs in germany</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.320" end="00:32:25.760" style="s2">maybe although i would expect that</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.240" end="00:32:27.519" style="s2">uh being in the u.s among</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.760" end="00:32:28.799" style="s2">lots of people who were so thrilled at</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.519" end="00:32:31.440" style="s2">the end of the war</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.799" end="00:32:32.240" style="s2">and the end of nazism uh would have</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.440" end="00:32:35.360" style="s2">helped</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.240" end="00:32:37.039" style="s2">uh tamp down those beliefs so i&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.360" end="00:32:39.200" style="s2">now i know what i think in response to</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.039" end="00:32:40.799" style="s2">this question i&#39;m not sure that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.200" end="00:32:42.240" style="s2">that&#39;s one read on this question i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.799" end="00:32:43.519" style="s2">sure that&#39;s the intention let&#39;s say that</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.240" end="00:32:44.320" style="s2">that&#39;s the reading okay here&#39;s what i</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.519" end="00:32:47.559" style="s2">would say</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.320" end="00:32:50.960" style="s2">there is um a great difference between</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.559" end="00:32:54.480" style="s2">rehabilitating somebody who actually did</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.960" end="00:32:56.000" style="s2">advance the ball of nazism because their</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.480" end="00:32:59.120" style="s2">knowledge is valuable</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.000" end="00:33:02.000" style="s2">right that is um</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.120" end="00:33:03.679" style="s2">dangerous precisely because in bringing</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.000" end="00:33:05.440" style="s2">whatever expertise they have you&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.679" end="00:33:08.080" style="s2">dragging a broken</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.440" end="00:33:09.760" style="s2">ideology that&#39;s manifestly dangerous on</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.080" end="00:33:11.279" style="s2">the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.760" end="00:33:13.919" style="s2">there&#39;s a question about how many people</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.279" end="00:33:16.559" style="s2">were carried along inside of germany</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.919" end="00:33:18.559" style="s2">in spite of their sense that this wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.559" end="00:33:21.840" style="s2">right and so we faced the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.559" end="00:33:23.279" style="s2">in this modern context where it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.840" end="00:33:25.120" style="s2">difficult to distinguish</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.279" end="00:33:26.880" style="s2">between people who earnestly believe</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.120" end="00:33:28.240" style="s2">this nonsense and people who claim to</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.880" end="00:33:29.120" style="s2">believe it and then rationalize</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.240" end="00:33:31.919" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.120" end="00:33:33.440" style="s2">into advancing it because in their</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.919" end="00:33:34.000" style="s2">social milieu there&#39;s no other way to do</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.440" end="00:33:36.399" style="s2">anything</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.000" end="00:33:37.919" style="s2">and so i feel certain without knowing a</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.399" end="00:33:39.440" style="s2">great deal about the particular</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.919" end="00:33:40.559" style="s2">individuals involved in operation</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.440" end="00:33:42.080" style="s2">paperclip</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.559" end="00:33:44.320" style="s2">that it will have been a mixed bag we</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.080" end="00:33:46.240" style="s2">will have done it in both cases and so</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.320" end="00:33:48.559" style="s2">there will be cases in which you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.240" end="00:33:51.600" style="s2">like conrad lorenz who we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.559" end="00:33:53.360" style="s2">talked about here briefly who was a</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.600" end="00:33:54.720" style="s2">member of the nazi party later went on</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.360" end="00:33:57.360" style="s2">to regret it</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.720" end="00:33:59.600" style="s2">um and did actually advance the ball</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.360" end="00:34:01.440" style="s2">within evolutionary biology that seems</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.600" end="00:34:03.519" style="s2">a case where we&#39;re perfectly justified</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.440" end="00:34:04.159" style="s2">and accepting somebody who did wrong</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.519" end="00:34:06.320" style="s2">things but</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.159" end="00:34:08.000" style="s2">you know he wasn&#39;t a murderer he</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.320" end="00:34:10.079" style="s2">understood the error of his ways</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.000" end="00:34:11.200" style="s2">regretted them and then there will be</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.079" end="00:34:15.520" style="s2">other cases in which</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.200" end="00:34:18.480" style="s2">we have uh accepted somebody because</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.520" end="00:34:19.280" style="s2">uh we allowed the value the utility of</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.480" end="00:34:21.839" style="s2">what they knew</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.280" end="00:34:22.480" style="s2">to outweigh the horror of what they</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.839" end="00:34:24.399" style="s2">believed</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.480" end="00:34:26.320" style="s2">and probably that&#39;s the line that one</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.399" end="00:34:29.440" style="s2">should draw</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.320" end="00:34:31.200" style="s2">okay we&#39;ve got um 10 more questions that</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.440" end="00:34:32.000" style="s2">are i think really good in this stream</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.200" end="00:34:33.440" style="s2">alone</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.000" end="00:34:35.200" style="s2">before we switch so let&#39;s try to get</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.440" end="00:34:36.720" style="s2">through these</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.200" end="00:34:38.399" style="s2">please comment on your belief in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.720" end="00:34:40.960" style="s2">possibility of performing something</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.399" end="00:34:42.320" style="s2">of performing something into being for</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.960" end="00:34:43.839" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.320" end="00:34:45.440" style="s2">can certain behavior that is enacted</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.839" end="00:34:47.359" style="s2">over and over create certain permanent</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.440" end="00:34:49.839" style="s2">attitudinal or belief states</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.359" end="00:34:52.399" style="s2">enactment leading to an empathic state</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.839" end="00:34:52.399" style="s2">for instance</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.720" end="00:34:56.720" style="s2">um i feel certain that if we chase this</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.560" end="00:34:58.160" style="s2">down far enough we will know for sure</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.720" end="00:35:01.520" style="s2">that it is possible yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.160" end="00:35:01.520" style="s2">um that uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.599" end="00:35:04.960" style="s2">not i mean there are certain things that</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.280" end="00:35:08.400" style="s2">can&#39;t be performed into being</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.960" end="00:35:08.400" style="s2">right but um</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.760" end="00:35:14.160" style="s2">but let&#39;s put it this way to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.599" end="00:35:16.640" style="s2">that something is belief-based</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.160" end="00:35:17.760" style="s2">you can start out not believing it and</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.640" end="00:35:19.440" style="s2">espousing it</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.760" end="00:35:21.040" style="s2">and then you can end up believing it and</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.440" end="00:35:23.040" style="s2">so i think that&#39;s a demonstration of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.040" end="00:35:24.960" style="s2">principle right yeah i guess i</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.040" end="00:35:26.720" style="s2">feel like there&#39;s lots of easy examples</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.960" end="00:35:28.000" style="s2">you know practice makes perfect is true</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.720" end="00:35:29.599" style="s2">for many many things</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.000" end="00:35:31.119" style="s2">and then there&#39;s some examples where you</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.599" end="00:35:32.880" style="s2">know you can&#39;t or</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.119" end="00:35:34.160" style="s2">it just won&#39;t be but i&#39;m we&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.880" end="00:35:35.520" style="s2">interested in all that middle ground</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.160" end="00:35:35.920" style="s2">where some people would disbelieve it</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.520" end="00:35:39.040" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.920" end="00:35:42.240" style="s2">and i think we would both tend to</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.040" end="00:35:43.760" style="s2">be less skeptical than some as to its</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.240" end="00:35:45.599" style="s2">possibility but i&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.760" end="00:35:48.160" style="s2">i&#39;m not coming up right now with some of</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.599" end="00:35:51.359" style="s2">those murky middle examples where there</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.160" end="00:35:51.359" style="s2">might be real disagreement</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.440" end="00:35:54.720" style="s2">um yeah i mean i guess maybe i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.079" end="00:35:56.400" style="s2">sure</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.720" end="00:35:58.400" style="s2">sure what the question means but it</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.400" end="00:36:02.079" style="s2">seems to me that</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.400" end="00:36:04.720" style="s2">um you can&#39;t do anything about</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.079" end="00:36:06.240" style="s2">factual reality unless that the fact in</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.720" end="00:36:09.359" style="s2">question is one of belief</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.240" end="00:36:12.400" style="s2">but that belief can transform</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.359" end="00:36:14.160" style="s2">a landscape and oh actually you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.400" end="00:36:16.960" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.160" end="00:36:16.960" style="s2">here&#39;s the example</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.280" end="00:36:22.000" style="s2">the rwandan genocide based on a conflict</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.640" end="00:36:25.200" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.000" end="00:36:26.160" style="s2">hutus and tutsis and these two groups as</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.200" end="00:36:29.440" style="s2">i understand it</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.160" end="00:36:32.480" style="s2">were not real lineages</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.440" end="00:36:34.160" style="s2">they were assigned based on phenotypic</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.480" end="00:36:35.839" style="s2">characteristics which may or may not</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.160" end="00:36:37.280" style="s2">have indicated something about lineage</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.839" end="00:36:38.240" style="s2">but certainly did not do it in any</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.280" end="00:36:39.839" style="s2">precise way</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.240" end="00:36:42.000" style="s2">in other words people with certain</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.839" end="00:36:46.079" style="s2">characteristics were assigned to</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.000" end="00:36:48.240" style="s2">to hutu for example and there was no um</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.079" end="00:36:50.480" style="s2">reality within the culture within like</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.240" end="00:36:50.880" style="s2">myth or cultural belief in advance of</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.480" end="00:36:53.280" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.880" end="00:36:54.079" style="s2">assigning i believe that is correct that</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.280" end="00:36:57.359" style="s2">this was actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.079" end="00:36:59.040" style="s2">in some sense it was top down a top down</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.359" end="00:37:00.560" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a star and you don&#39;t it was</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.040" end="00:37:03.920" style="s2">star-bellied sneetches</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.560" end="00:37:06.839" style="s2">uh and it resulted obviously</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.920" end="00:37:08.079" style="s2">in a political murder and then a</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.839" end="00:37:11.119" style="s2">genocide</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.079" end="00:37:12.720" style="s2">um so i wonder if that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.119" end="00:37:17.520" style="s2">ultimate example of it well</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.720" end="00:37:19.200" style="s2">yeah amazing unity 2020 question</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.520" end="00:37:20.880" style="s2">family member asked how the organization</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.200" end="00:37:22.160" style="s2">will decide that x and y are center</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.880" end="00:37:24.160" style="s2">right and center left</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.160" end="00:37:25.440" style="s2">i had a response but like your input</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.160" end="00:37:27.599" style="s2">thanks um</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.440" end="00:37:28.960" style="s2">i think we&#39;re going to have to just do</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.599" end="00:37:31.680" style="s2">it and i think in most cases</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.960" end="00:37:32.160" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t it&#39;s not controversial i did</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.680" end="00:37:34.320" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.160" end="00:37:35.680" style="s2">a back channel conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.320" end="00:37:37.680" style="s2">somebody who</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.680" end="00:37:39.359" style="s2">we were and are looking at as somebody</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.680" end="00:37:40.480" style="s2">who could potentially inhabit one of</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.359" end="00:37:42.880" style="s2">those spaces</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.480" end="00:37:44.480" style="s2">and i asked him where he would place</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.880" end="00:37:45.920" style="s2">himself</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.480" end="00:37:48.640" style="s2">and we had a very good discussion based</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.920" end="00:37:51.280" style="s2">on it and it turned out um</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.640" end="00:37:52.720" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t simple in his case um that</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.280" end="00:37:53.839" style="s2">there were actually arguments to be made</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.720" end="00:37:57.119" style="s2">both ways</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.839" end="00:37:57.119" style="s2">but that um</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.200" end="00:38:00.960" style="s2">probably from the perspective of most</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.200" end="00:38:04.320" style="s2">voters he would be</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.960" end="00:38:07.280" style="s2">right of center and so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.320" end="00:38:09.119" style="s2">if you come down to something that is uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.280" end="00:38:12.079" style="s2">divided such that is very near</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.119" end="00:38:13.599" style="s2">the middle it actually matters less um</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.079" end="00:38:16.560" style="s2">but in this case</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.599" end="00:38:17.280" style="s2">uh but the but the optics are such that</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.560" end="00:38:19.760" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.280" end="00:38:21.200" style="s2">you want to have someone who appears to</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.760" end="00:38:22.560" style="s2">be more in the blue side and someone</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.200" end="00:38:23.119" style="s2">else who appears to be more on the right</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.560" end="00:38:25.359" style="s2">side</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.119" end="00:38:26.400" style="s2">given the whole premise of unity 2020.</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.359" end="00:38:27.839" style="s2">well i don&#39;t think it&#39;s so much a</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.400" end="00:38:30.160" style="s2">question of optics i think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.839" end="00:38:33.119" style="s2">question of assurance</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.160" end="00:38:35.040" style="s2">that the thing that causes people to</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.119" end="00:38:35.760" style="s2">accept that some plan like this might</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.040" end="00:38:37.839" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.760" end="00:38:39.680" style="s2">is the idea that it doesn&#39;t run the risk</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.839" end="00:38:40.960" style="s2">that their values will not be</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.680" end="00:38:42.880" style="s2">represented in the room</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.960" end="00:38:44.400" style="s2">where decisions are made so if the rumor</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.880" end="00:38:45.839" style="s2">decisions are made as the white house</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.400" end="00:38:46.880" style="s2">and it&#39;s a team that&#39;s making those</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.839" end="00:38:49.520" style="s2">decisions</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.880" end="00:38:50.960" style="s2">what i want to know as a voter is is</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.520" end="00:38:53.839" style="s2">there somebody in that room</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.960" end="00:38:55.440" style="s2">who gets what motivates me right because</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.839" end="00:38:57.359" style="s2">then i know i&#39;m not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.440" end="00:38:59.040" style="s2">shut out of the discussion which is now</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.359" end="00:39:01.359" style="s2">the common experience</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.040" end="00:39:02.160" style="s2">so somebody who&#39;s very much in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.359" end="00:39:04.960" style="s2">center</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.160" end="00:39:05.359" style="s2">is hearing people either side and so</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.960" end="00:39:07.119" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.359" end="00:39:08.960" style="s2">values are still understood in the room</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.119" end="00:39:12.640" style="s2">so i think it&#39;s protection enough</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.960" end="00:39:14.000" style="s2">yeah next question seems our culture has</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.640" end="00:39:15.440" style="s2">messed up sexuality so</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.000" end="00:39:18.000" style="s2">badly that it&#39;s hard to know where to</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.440" end="00:39:18.720" style="s2">begin how should children be educated</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.000" end="00:39:22.480" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.720" end="00:39:25.280" style="s2">earlier later both</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.480" end="00:39:26.880" style="s2">where to begin with sexuality look it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.280" end="00:39:29.200" style="s2">not a new answer but dinner</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.880" end="00:39:29.200" style="s2">dinner</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.160" end="00:39:35.119" style="s2">you gave me that look it wasn&#39;t bedroom</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.960" end="00:39:38.480" style="s2">eyes either</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.119" end="00:39:41.040" style="s2">um yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.480" end="00:39:42.320" style="s2">what i was going to say uh we have we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.040" end="00:39:44.320" style="s2">written a fair bit in</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.320" end="00:39:46.720" style="s2">our in our book which will be out next</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.320" end="00:39:49.119" style="s2">year about um</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.720" end="00:39:50.720" style="s2">how we might fix some of the ways that</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.119" end="00:39:52.400" style="s2">culture our modern culture is</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.720" end="00:39:54.320" style="s2">screwed up our understanding of sex and</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.400" end="00:39:56.560" style="s2">gender and sexuality but we specifically</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.320" end="00:39:59.040" style="s2">didn&#39;t and also about childhood</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.560" end="00:40:00.400" style="s2">um but we have not explicitly talked</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.040" end="00:40:01.440" style="s2">about how children should be educated</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.400" end="00:40:03.520" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.440" end="00:40:06.640" style="s2">uh and i don&#39;t have a i don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.520" end="00:40:10.240" style="s2">ready a ready answer on this i think</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.640" end="00:40:13.280" style="s2">um we</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.240" end="00:40:13.760" style="s2">we talked with our children early about</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.280" end="00:40:16.640" style="s2">almost</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.760" end="00:40:18.079" style="s2">everything without being graphic about</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.640" end="00:40:21.680" style="s2">anything</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.079" end="00:40:22.720" style="s2">and almost i think everything that i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.680" end="00:40:25.359" style="s2">heard either of them</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.720" end="00:40:26.000" style="s2">say about what they heard in school has</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.359" end="00:40:29.359" style="s2">been</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.000" end="00:40:31.760" style="s2">nonsense yeah and you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.359" end="00:40:33.200" style="s2">i would have expected from i don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.760" end="00:40:33.920" style="s2">know that i remember any sex ed in</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.200" end="00:40:35.839" style="s2">school but</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.920" end="00:40:37.839" style="s2">my sort of model of what sex ed is is</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.839" end="00:40:38.240" style="s2">it&#39;s banal and uninteresting and just</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.839" end="00:40:39.599" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.240" end="00:40:41.839" style="s2">leaves you not really knowing anything</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.599" end="00:40:45.680" style="s2">except a few things about the mechanics</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.839" end="00:40:47.920" style="s2">and um instead what we&#39;ve heard from</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.680" end="00:40:49.680" style="s2">our kids in late elementary and middle</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.920" end="00:40:53.040" style="s2">school which they&#39;re now beyond</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.680" end="00:40:56.720" style="s2">uh was actually just wrong just wrong</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.040" end="00:40:58.240" style="s2">stuff uh in including you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.720" end="00:41:00.000" style="s2">including the chromosomes exist on a</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.240" end="00:41:02.960" style="s2">continuum and such</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.000" end="00:41:04.000" style="s2">um so i would say a couple things one</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.960" end="00:41:07.839" style="s2">based on</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.000" end="00:41:08.480" style="s2">uh what we&#39;ve seen you have to alert</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.839" end="00:41:10.319" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.480" end="00:41:13.040" style="s2">to the fact that they are going to hear</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.319" end="00:41:16.240" style="s2">garbage and that they not only have</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.040" end="00:41:18.240" style="s2">license to absent themselves from it</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.240" end="00:41:20.160" style="s2">even if not vocally in other words they</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.240" end="00:41:21.119" style="s2">may have to nod their heads and answer</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.160" end="00:41:24.800" style="s2">the questions on an</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.119" end="00:41:27.520" style="s2">exam in school as if x but that</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.800" end="00:41:28.960" style="s2">it&#39;s your duty as a parent to alert them</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.520" end="00:41:31.200" style="s2">that there is a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.960" end="00:41:33.520" style="s2">modern pseudo sophistication that they</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.200" end="00:41:33.520" style="s2">will be</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.680" end="00:41:36.800" style="s2">probably forced to pretend they agree</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.680" end="00:41:38.560" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.800" end="00:41:40.640" style="s2">as children it cannot be expected that</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.560" end="00:41:43.119" style="s2">they will fight that battle</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.640" end="00:41:43.920" style="s2">at their place it is potentially</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.119" end="00:41:46.640" style="s2">dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.920" end="00:41:48.720" style="s2">in a family context to absent yourself</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.640" end="00:41:51.920" style="s2">from this</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.720" end="00:41:54.880" style="s2">nonsense because it will</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.920" end="00:41:56.160" style="s2">expose you to accusations of bigotry and</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.880" end="00:41:57.760" style="s2">worse</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.160" end="00:41:59.280" style="s2">but you don&#39;t really have any choice</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.760" end="00:42:00.480" style="s2">because you&#39;re dealing with one of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.280" end="00:42:03.440" style="s2">central</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.480" end="00:42:04.160" style="s2">birthrights that we have right which is</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.440" end="00:42:06.240" style="s2">a healthy</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.160" end="00:42:07.520" style="s2">sexuality and just the same way a</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.240" end="00:42:10.560" style="s2">molester interrupts</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.520" end="00:42:12.400" style="s2">healthy sexuality and has no right to do</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.560" end="00:42:14.720" style="s2">so your school doesn&#39;t have any right</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.400" end="00:42:16.319" style="s2">to disrupt your child&#39;s understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.720" end="00:42:19.599" style="s2">what&#39;s going on with them</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.319" end="00:42:21.920" style="s2">no matter what its objectives are so</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.599" end="00:42:23.119" style="s2">you have to prepare them for the lies</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.920" end="00:42:26.319" style="s2">you have to tell them</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.119" end="00:42:28.079" style="s2">the truth as best you understand it um</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.319" end="00:42:30.240" style="s2">you know give them a sense that</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.079" end="00:42:33.119" style="s2">sexuality is a</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.240" end="00:42:33.680" style="s2">a strange and interesting landscape in</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.119" end="00:42:35.839" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.680" end="00:42:37.440" style="s2">uh things are not narrow and simple it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.839" end="00:42:39.839" style="s2">not fairy tale stuff</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.440" end="00:42:41.119" style="s2">so uh they shouldn&#39;t feel that they are</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.839" end="00:42:43.440" style="s2">off just because</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.119" end="00:42:44.160" style="s2">it is not something anybody&#39;s explained</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.440" end="00:42:46.000" style="s2">to them</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.160" end="00:42:48.240" style="s2">in a way that leads them to anticipate</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.000" end="00:42:49.280" style="s2">it correctly but in some sense your job</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.240" end="00:42:51.760" style="s2">as a parent</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.280" end="00:42:52.319" style="s2">is to fight the nonsense wherever it</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.760" end="00:42:54.640" style="s2">comes from</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.319" end="00:42:56.319" style="s2">even when it&#39;s the state maybe</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.640" end="00:43:00.319" style="s2">especially when it&#39;s the state</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.319" end="00:43:03.040" style="s2">oh and the final thing is maybe</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.319" end="00:43:03.680" style="s2">top of the list is you should give your</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.040" end="00:43:06.400" style="s2">kids</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.680" end="00:43:07.680" style="s2">a really healthy warning about</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.400" end="00:43:10.560" style="s2">pornography</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.680" end="00:43:12.319" style="s2">because the following fact is true</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.560" end="00:43:16.240" style="s2">historically speaking</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.319" end="00:43:19.599" style="s2">people have in general learned about sex</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.240" end="00:43:20.319" style="s2">by observing it right because people</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.599" end="00:43:22.960" style="s2">lived in</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.319" end="00:43:23.680" style="s2">very close quarters and so it was</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.960" end="00:43:25.200" style="s2">observable</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.680" end="00:43:26.640" style="s2">children pretended to be asleep when</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.200" end="00:43:27.440" style="s2">their parents had sex and they learned</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.640" end="00:43:30.720" style="s2">what sex was</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.440" end="00:43:33.200" style="s2">actually like which means that</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.720" end="00:43:35.760" style="s2">they are sensitive to messages about</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.200" end="00:43:36.000" style="s2">what sex is like and because pornography</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.760" end="00:43:39.040" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.000" end="00:43:39.680" style="s2">motivated by market forces it is</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.040" end="00:43:43.040" style="s2">therefore</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.680" end="00:43:44.880" style="s2">inherently prone to extremes</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.040" end="00:43:47.359" style="s2">why because you&#39;ve got a bunch of</p>

<p begin="00:48:58.079" end="00:49:01.440" style="s2">could take three days to get through one</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.920" end="00:49:03.599" style="s2">of these things three weeks more like</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.440" end="00:49:05.359" style="s2">yeah it could be it could be either but</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.599" end="00:49:06.960" style="s2">the point is you would go through and</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.359" end="00:49:07.520" style="s2">just extrapolate from what you were</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.960" end="00:49:08.960" style="s2">hearing</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.520" end="00:49:10.480" style="s2">first of all you would test it against</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.960" end="00:49:11.280" style="s2">your model are they saying something</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.480" end="00:49:14.079" style="s2">wrong because</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.280" end="00:49:15.280" style="s2">you know that sounds unlikely um but</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.079" end="00:49:16.880" style="s2">anyway you could do this and we would</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.280" end="00:49:17.440" style="s2">have these great discussions about each</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.880" end="00:49:20.400" style="s2">of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.440" end="00:49:21.839" style="s2">segments and i see no reason that you</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.400" end="00:49:23.760" style="s2">and a few friends</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.839" end="00:49:25.200" style="s2">well it&#39;s tough though if you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.760" end="00:49:27.119" style="s2">a fact check in the room</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.200" end="00:49:29.040" style="s2">in the form of you or me or you know we</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.119" end="00:49:31.520" style="s2">we did this with bob trivers</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.040" end="00:49:33.599" style="s2">you know like it it&#39;s tough i imagine</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.520" end="00:49:35.200" style="s2">that would be very tough to know</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.599" end="00:49:36.800" style="s2">when you were going down some path that</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.200" end="00:49:38.160" style="s2">didn&#39;t make sense if there&#39;s no one in</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.800" end="00:49:38.960" style="s2">the room who knows any better than you</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.160" end="00:49:41.440" style="s2">do yet</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.960" end="00:49:42.559" style="s2">about um how you know what a falsifiable</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.440" end="00:49:44.240" style="s2">prediction sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.559" end="00:49:46.319" style="s2">well you need some grounding which is</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.240" end="00:49:47.200" style="s2">why i suggested starting with those</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.319" end="00:49:50.000" style="s2">books</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.200" end="00:49:51.440" style="s2">but um i have the sense that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.000" end="00:49:53.839" style="s2">little bit like</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.440" end="00:49:55.680" style="s2">learning to play tennis by going out on</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.839" end="00:49:56.640" style="s2">the court and volleying which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.680" end="00:49:57.920" style="s2">you&#39;re not going to know that you have</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.640" end="00:49:59.920" style="s2">it right and it&#39;s not to say that you</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.920" end="00:50:01.680" style="s2">won&#39;t learn the occasional bad habit</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.920" end="00:50:03.520" style="s2">but if you do it and you like it a</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.680" end="00:50:04.400" style="s2">you&#39;re going to tune into evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.520" end="00:50:07.040" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.400" end="00:50:07.599" style="s2">and you will begin to get a sense for</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.040" end="00:50:09.200" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.599" end="00:50:11.359" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s tough though i mean the</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.200" end="00:50:12.000" style="s2">attenborough documentaries are really</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.359" end="00:50:15.680" style="s2">the only</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.000" end="00:50:17.680" style="s2">ones like it is alarming how much</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.680" end="00:50:19.200" style="s2">just bad thinking and untrue things are</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.680" end="00:50:20.960" style="s2">in almost every nature documentary like</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.200" end="00:50:22.160" style="s2">just put aside the fact that almost all</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.960" end="00:50:25.359" style="s2">of the footage</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.160" end="00:50:27.680" style="s2">uh is you know is of</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.359" end="00:50:29.040" style="s2">extremely rare but true things and sort</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.680" end="00:50:29.760" style="s2">of made to look like it&#39;s happening all</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.040" end="00:50:32.319" style="s2">the time</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.760" end="00:50:34.160" style="s2">or worst case scenario but are all too</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.319" end="00:50:34.960" style="s2">common just fabricated just not what it</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.160" end="00:50:37.760" style="s2">appears</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.960" end="00:50:38.800" style="s2">but um even if the footage you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.760" end="00:50:41.920" style="s2">looking at is real</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.800" end="00:50:42.720" style="s2">if rare uh the the narrative that goes</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.920" end="00:50:44.640" style="s2">over it in</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.720" end="00:50:45.760" style="s2">almost every nature documentary out</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.640" end="00:50:48.400" style="s2">there is often</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.760" end="00:50:48.960" style="s2">so bad and they&#39;ll just slip in untrue</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.400" end="00:50:51.040" style="s2">things with</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.960" end="00:50:52.720" style="s2">with true things and bad thinking with</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.040" end="00:50:54.559" style="s2">good thinking such that</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.720" end="00:50:56.079" style="s2">you know i&#39;m not i&#39;m not surprised that</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.559" end="00:50:57.599" style="s2">most people don&#39;t know how to do</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.079" end="00:50:59.520" style="s2">the logic because this is you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.599" end="00:51:00.640" style="s2">nature documentaries is what a lot of us</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.520" end="00:51:03.440" style="s2">grow up on</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.640" end="00:51:04.720" style="s2">and um if you&#39;ve never had someone say</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.440" end="00:51:06.960" style="s2">yes that doesn&#39;t make any sense</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.720" end="00:51:08.160" style="s2">look at that um that does and this is</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.960" end="00:51:09.599" style="s2">what i did this</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.160" end="00:51:11.680" style="s2">very rarely but you did this a lot in</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.599" end="00:51:12.960" style="s2">your classes and this is exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.680" end="00:51:14.960" style="s2">you were doing as you were training</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.960" end="00:51:16.800" style="s2">people&#39;s brains to start questioning</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.960" end="00:51:18.240" style="s2">even those things when they&#39;re said in a</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.800" end="00:51:22.240" style="s2">nice sonorous voice</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.240" end="00:51:25.839" style="s2">um are actually not true yeah right um</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.240" end="00:51:28.240" style="s2">yes so uh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.839" end="00:51:29.200" style="s2">all of that i think if it can work it</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.240" end="00:51:31.440" style="s2">won&#39;t be perfect</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.200" end="00:51:32.720" style="s2">but uh it&#39;s a skill and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.440" end="00:51:36.079" style="s2">learnable</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.720" end="00:51:37.280" style="s2">on your own to an extent yeah uh</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.079" end="00:51:39.920" style="s2">okay two more questions here and then</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.280" end="00:51:41.760" style="s2">we&#39;ll go to the next live stream</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.920" end="00:51:43.680" style="s2">are you too familiar with the book why</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.760" end="00:51:45.839" style="s2">fish don&#39;t exist by lulu miller</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.680" end="00:51:47.599" style="s2">it traces the life of 19th early 20th</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.839" end="00:51:48.880" style="s2">century biologist david star jordan and</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.599" end="00:51:51.280" style="s2">explores some of the great mysteries of</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.880" end="00:51:54.079" style="s2">life and meaning worth checking out</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.280" end="00:51:55.520" style="s2">so i will say i have not read the book</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.079" end="00:51:58.480" style="s2">but i listened to her</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.520" end="00:51:58.800" style="s2">on i think it was radio lab and it drove</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.480" end="00:52:02.400" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.800" end="00:52:05.520" style="s2">crazy she so clearly misunderstood</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.400" end="00:52:06.880" style="s2">basic evolutionary principles like</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.520" end="00:52:08.480" style="s2">you know so the very the title of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.880" end="00:52:10.640" style="s2">book why fish don&#39;t exist she really</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.480" end="00:52:14.880" style="s2">thinks that fish don&#39;t exist because</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.640" end="00:52:16.559" style="s2">um we call things not fish that are fish</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.880" end="00:52:18.000" style="s2">like the presence of the existence of</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.559" end="00:52:21.040" style="s2">mammals suggests that fish don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.000" end="00:52:22.800" style="s2">exist and so basically because we would</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.040" end="00:52:25.520" style="s2">have to be fish then fish don&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.800" end="00:52:26.880" style="s2">yeah and you know that i i could see you</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.520" end="00:52:27.920" style="s2">doing that in a way that was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.880" end="00:52:30.960" style="s2">okay but she</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.920" end="00:52:31.520" style="s2">it seemed super ideological and really</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.960" end="00:52:34.319" style="s2">driven</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.520" end="00:52:35.680" style="s2">to to much like so much critique of</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.319" end="00:52:36.400" style="s2">evolution of biology is and she&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.680" end="00:52:40.079" style="s2">you know she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.400" end="00:52:42.400" style="s2">she&#39;s not she&#39;s not uber woke</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.079" end="00:52:44.160" style="s2">uh it&#39;s not that kind of critique but</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.400" end="00:52:47.359" style="s2">but at least in this interview</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.160" end="00:52:49.280" style="s2">i was yelling at her while i was in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.359" end="00:52:50.880" style="s2">car driving listening to this podcast</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.280" end="00:52:52.480" style="s2">so the fact that someone who&#39;s listening</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.880" end="00:52:53.040" style="s2">to us says oh actually this book makes</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.480" end="00:52:55.280" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.040" end="00:52:56.720" style="s2">you know it might be it might be worth</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.280" end="00:52:58.960" style="s2">reading um and then</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.720" end="00:53:00.480" style="s2">doing a book review uh well i must have</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.960" end="00:53:02.640" style="s2">been listening to this this year</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.480" end="00:53:06.000" style="s2">last and if she was interviewing about</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.640" end="00:53:07.760" style="s2">it it&#39;s new it&#39;s a new book</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.000" end="00:53:09.040" style="s2">it is possible that she&#39;s in fact</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.760" end="00:53:11.920" style="s2">responding to</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.040" end="00:53:14.000" style="s2">our insistence that we are fish and that</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.920" end="00:53:14.559" style="s2">this is kind of a way of i know i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.000" end="00:53:18.480" style="s2">think so</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.559" end="00:53:20.800" style="s2">no it&#39;s i mean it&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.480" end="00:53:23.040" style="s2">i mean how long do it if the fact of</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.800" end="00:53:25.760" style="s2">mammals means that fish don&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.040" end="00:53:27.440" style="s2">that&#39;s the that&#39;s an inversion of our</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.760" end="00:53:29.200" style="s2">take on it which is that mammals are</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.440" end="00:53:29.520" style="s2">fish yeah but that&#39;s not what this book</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.200" end="00:53:32.640" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.520" end="00:53:33.839" style="s2">oh okay no and it&#39;s not um it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.640" end="00:53:36.160" style="s2">there&#39;s no way it&#39;s a response to</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.839" end="00:53:38.400" style="s2">anything going on in in our sphere</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.160" end="00:53:41.280" style="s2">um but anyway it&#39;s you know it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.400" end="00:53:43.280" style="s2">a historical biography that</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.280" end="00:53:45.200" style="s2">that bae may have more value than i</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.280" end="00:53:48.240" style="s2">thought uh given this</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.200" end="00:53:50.000" style="s2">given this recommendation but um what i</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.240" end="00:53:51.520" style="s2">heard from the author did not lend</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.000" end="00:53:54.800" style="s2">confidence</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.520" end="00:53:56.640" style="s2">um one more question but also</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.800" end="00:54:00.079" style="s2">do you want to say anything about this</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.640" end="00:54:01.359" style="s2">the this person who</p>

<p begin="00:54:27.359" end="00:54:30.400" style="s2">yep all right</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.640" end="00:54:32.000" style="s2">okay final question from this and then</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.400" end="00:54:35.280" style="s2">we&#39;ll skip to the next one</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.000" end="00:54:37.119" style="s2">does woke culture equal toxic femininity</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.280" end="00:54:38.480" style="s2">the manipulative overuse of the victim</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.119" end="00:54:40.000" style="s2">card</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.480" end="00:54:41.839" style="s2">might be the same thing as a woman</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.000" end="00:54:44.240" style="s2">trying to get out of its speeding ticket</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.839" end="00:54:44.960" style="s2">emphases on safe spaces and language</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.240" end="00:54:46.640" style="s2">policing</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.960" end="00:54:49.680" style="s2">are the same thing as the archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.640" end="00:54:52.640" style="s2">consuming overprotective mother</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.680" end="00:54:53.280" style="s2">unless i&#39;m not sure about that last one</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.640" end="00:54:56.559" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.280" end="00:54:58.240" style="s2">but the but the framing i think is quite</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.559" end="00:55:00.640" style="s2">interesting and it fits with</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.240" end="00:55:02.480" style="s2">it being a female dominated movement and</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.640" end="00:55:05.040" style="s2">it does not reflect the best of</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.480" end="00:55:06.240" style="s2">of femaleness at all i think i think</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.040" end="00:55:09.280" style="s2">that&#39;s the important thing</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.240" end="00:55:09.280" style="s2">is that uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.599" end="00:55:13.280" style="s2">toxic femininity is not synonymous with</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.599" end="00:55:15.040" style="s2">femininity any more than toxic</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.280" end="00:55:16.400" style="s2">masculinity is synonymous with</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.040" end="00:55:18.400" style="s2">masculinity</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.400" end="00:55:19.760" style="s2">and so which is exactly the point that i</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.400" end="00:55:22.960" style="s2">made in my</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.760" end="00:55:24.400" style="s2">essay of that name for colette yes so in</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.960" end="00:55:25.839" style="s2">any case i do think that there might be</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.400" end="00:55:27.680" style="s2">something to the idea that the</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.839" end="00:55:29.599" style="s2">particular dysfunction we are seeing</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.680" end="00:55:31.520" style="s2">leans more towards the</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.599" end="00:55:32.960" style="s2">toxic feminine than the toxic masculine</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.520" end="00:55:36.160" style="s2">but the toxic is the problem</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.960" end="00:55:37.280" style="s2">yeah although i mean frankly the um</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.160" end="00:55:38.720" style="s2">the people who are more prone to</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.280" end="00:55:39.599" style="s2">violence it&#39;s sort of you know it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.720" end="00:55:40.720" style="s2">we&#39;re now getting</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.599" end="00:55:43.119" style="s2">you know maybe the stuff that happens in</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.720" end="00:55:43.760" style="s2">the workplace is more toxic femininity</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.119" end="00:55:45.520" style="s2">style</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.760" end="00:55:47.200" style="s2">garbage and the place the violence in</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.520" end="00:55:48.160" style="s2">the streets is more toxic masculinity</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.200" end="00:55:50.400" style="s2">style garbage</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.160" end="00:55:52.000" style="s2">and it&#39;s just it&#39;s toxic either way and</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.400" end="00:55:55.520" style="s2">you know neither of us really love</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.000" end="00:55:57.040" style="s2">this you know toxic x framing but um</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.520" end="00:55:58.559" style="s2">you know men are more likely to use</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.040" end="00:55:59.200" style="s2">physical force and women are more likely</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.559" end="00:56:02.000" style="s2">to use</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.200" end="00:56:03.599" style="s2">emotional coercion to get what they want</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.000" end="00:56:05.839" style="s2">when they&#39;re aggrieved and</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.599" end="00:56:07.040" style="s2">um you know not reflecting the best of</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.839" end="00:56:09.440" style="s2">what they could be doing</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.040" end="00:56:10.640" style="s2">yeah but even the violence here it is</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.440" end="00:56:12.240" style="s2">masculine in a way</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.640" end="00:56:14.480" style="s2">but the point is what is it pointed at</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.240" end="00:56:18.400" style="s2">and how did it get pointed at that</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.480" end="00:56:21.440" style="s2">in other words it&#39;s sort of a uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.400" end="00:56:25.040" style="s2">decimate the inconvenient</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.440" end="00:56:27.760" style="s2">right so anyway i</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.040" end="00:56:29.280" style="s2">i&#39;m unsure but there is something there</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.760" end="00:56:32.079" style="s2">is something to this</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.280" end="00:56:33.040" style="s2">all right where are the remaining okay</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.079" end="00:56:37.040" style="s2">here we go</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.040" end="00:56:39.760" style="s2">did you draw a line here zach yes</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.040" end="00:56:39.760" style="s2">okay here we go</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.680" end="00:56:46.240" style="s2">okay well we&#39;ll get through a few of</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.119" end="00:56:46.240" style="s2">these from this hour</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.520" end="00:56:53.040" style="s2">female here when i get sick my libido</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.920" end="00:56:55.119" style="s2">skyrockets</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.040" end="00:56:56.880" style="s2">this makes sense to me for males last</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.119" end="00:56:58.160" style="s2">chance to spread seed but not in females</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.880" end="00:56:59.760" style="s2">is my brain confused</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.160" end="00:57:01.680" style="s2">or is there an evolutionary reason i</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.760" end="00:57:02.880" style="s2">don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.680" end="00:57:04.799" style="s2">gosh i think it depends it really</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.880" end="00:57:06.240" style="s2">depends on what kind of sick you are</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.799" end="00:57:08.079" style="s2">yeah right like there&#39;s just there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.240" end="00:57:10.400" style="s2">lot of ways to be sick and if it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.079" end="00:57:12.319" style="s2">sick across the board then</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.400" end="00:57:13.680" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t like there&#39;s no way to put</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.319" end="00:57:15.440" style="s2">an evolutionary explanation</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.680" end="00:57:16.720" style="s2">to that because um there are too many</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.440" end="00:57:17.599" style="s2">different ways to be sick what that</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.720" end="00:57:20.799" style="s2">means but</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.599" end="00:57:23.839" style="s2">um you know if it you know if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.799" end="00:57:25.520" style="s2">if it&#39;s an sdi it could be the</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.839" end="00:57:27.839" style="s2">the pathogen doing its bidding and</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.520" end="00:57:30.480" style="s2">trying to get you to spread it</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.839" end="00:57:31.920" style="s2">uh if it even if it&#39;s you know something</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.480" end="00:57:33.599" style="s2">respiratory or gut it could be the</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.920" end="00:57:35.040" style="s2">pathogen doing its bidding and trying to</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.599" end="00:57:37.040" style="s2">get you to spread it</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.040" end="00:57:40.000" style="s2">that&#39;s a fair point um yeah really</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.040" end="00:57:42.000" style="s2">anything that is spread by close contact</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.000" end="00:57:43.200" style="s2">but the question i have is is this a</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.000" end="00:57:45.520" style="s2">common pattern</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.200" end="00:57:46.240" style="s2">yeah i had never occurred to me i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.520" end="00:57:47.280" style="s2">experience it</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.240" end="00:57:50.079" style="s2">never occurred to me i&#39;ve never heard</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.280" end="00:57:53.359" style="s2">anyone say it yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.079" end="00:57:56.799" style="s2">but uh yeah beyond the is it is</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.359" end="00:57:59.040" style="s2">this the pathogen doing its bidding um</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.799" end="00:57:59.920" style="s2">i don&#39;t i agree with the person asking</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.040" end="00:58:01.839" style="s2">the question</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.920" end="00:58:03.040" style="s2">that a sort of a dandelion strategy</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.839" end="00:58:06.400" style="s2">doesn&#39;t apply to</p>

<p begin="00:59:49.680" end="00:59:54.400" style="s2">to its males uh ejaculating as they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:00:14.000" end="01:00:17.200" style="s2">basically you don&#39;t need you don&#39;t need</p>

<p begin="01:01:31.280" end="01:01:34.079" style="s2">think we can address the actual question</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.720" end="01:01:36.640" style="s2">without knowing exactly what</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.079" end="01:01:37.520" style="s2">he&#39;s done right yep now there was an</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.640" end="01:01:40.240" style="s2">amazing</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.520" end="01:01:41.040" style="s2">display at the university of michigan</p>

<p begin="01:01:41.040" end="01:01:45.280" style="s2">about the museum of zoology uh no it was</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.839" end="01:01:47.280" style="s2">the ruthman museum</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.280" end="01:01:50.079" style="s2">museum zoology so this is this is our</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.280" end="01:01:52.960" style="s2">alma mater well it was the entire museum</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.079" end="01:01:54.000" style="s2">had uh a display about how the pyramids</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.960" end="01:01:55.599" style="s2">came to be</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.000" end="01:01:57.599" style="s2">in spite of the various mysteries which</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.599" end="01:01:58.960" style="s2">include the fact that there&#39;s no quarry</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.599" end="01:02:00.400" style="s2">from which the stones could have been</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.960" end="01:02:02.160" style="s2">taken</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.400" end="01:02:04.160" style="s2">nor a plausible mechanism for their</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.160" end="01:02:06.400" style="s2">transportation</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.160" end="01:02:07.599" style="s2">and this display argued very</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.400" end="01:02:10.319" style="s2">compellingly i thought</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.599" end="01:02:11.680" style="s2">i mean very compellingly that this was</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.319" end="01:02:15.200" style="s2">nile sediment that was</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.680" end="01:02:16.559" style="s2">cast in place um which would seem</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.200" end="01:02:18.240" style="s2">you know that&#39;s in my head and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.559" end="01:02:19.839" style="s2">it&#39;s because i saw that display and</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.240" end="01:02:21.119" style="s2">that&#39;s just what i understand it to be</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.839" end="01:02:22.000" style="s2">yeah but so i don&#39;t know whether that</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.119" end="01:02:24.000" style="s2">has become</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.000" end="01:02:25.599" style="s2">uh the standard interpretation or that</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.000" end="01:02:27.039" style="s2">interpretation has been falsified in</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.599" end="01:02:28.640" style="s2">some way in which case i would want to</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.039" end="01:02:29.599" style="s2">check whether the falsification was</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.640" end="01:02:31.520" style="s2">right or whether</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.599" end="01:02:33.599" style="s2">we have thrown out the right explanation</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.520" end="01:02:36.000" style="s2">because it answered so many questions</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.599" end="01:02:38.000" style="s2">yeah nile sediment cast in place right</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.000" end="01:02:40.400" style="s2">yeah carry it up one bucket at a time</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.000" end="01:02:41.440" style="s2">it&#39;s lighter too carried up without the</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.400" end="01:02:43.440" style="s2">water</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.440" end="01:02:44.799" style="s2">um i think it would have to have been oh</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.440" end="01:02:45.119" style="s2">i know it wouldn&#39;t be lighter because it</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.799" end="01:02:46.480" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.119" end="01:02:48.640" style="s2">although all the water would eventually</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.480" end="01:02:52.960" style="s2">evaporate out once in this cast</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.640" end="01:02:55.200" style="s2">yeah yeah what about the role of disgust</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.960" end="01:02:58.480" style="s2">as a psychometric factor in conservatism</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.200" end="01:03:00.480" style="s2">i heard this in a jbp lecture yeah i</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.480" end="01:03:01.200" style="s2">think that um there are a number of</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.480" end="01:03:03.760" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.200" end="01:03:05.200" style="s2">um sort of big five and other cycle</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.760" end="01:03:08.160" style="s2">personality traits</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.200" end="01:03:09.200" style="s2">that are traceable to people left of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.160" end="01:03:13.680" style="s2">aisle versus right</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.200" end="01:03:15.520" style="s2">and um disgust is a</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.680" end="01:03:17.359" style="s2">i think just maybe a more frequent</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.520" end="01:03:18.400" style="s2">emotion that is reported as being</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.359" end="01:03:20.960" style="s2">experienced by</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.400" end="01:03:23.359" style="s2">people who identify as conservatives i</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.960" end="01:03:26.880" style="s2">don&#39;t know what more to say about that</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.359" end="01:03:28.559" style="s2">nope yeah um favorite nature</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.880" end="01:03:29.839" style="s2">documentaries question mark this came in</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.559" end="01:03:31.920" style="s2">before we started talking about nature</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.839" end="01:03:33.839" style="s2">documentaries yeah i think so basically</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.920" end="01:03:35.440" style="s2">anything by attenborough um and there</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.839" end="01:03:38.880" style="s2">are some other good ones out there but</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.440" end="01:03:41.760" style="s2">attenborough has i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.880" end="01:03:42.720" style="s2">how he came to but he just understands</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.760" end="01:03:45.520" style="s2">more about</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.720" end="01:03:47.680" style="s2">evolution that oh yeah than anyone else</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.520" end="01:03:49.359" style="s2">who is doing these things and</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.680" end="01:03:50.799" style="s2">and now has a team i don&#39;t he&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.359" end="01:03:51.280" style="s2">not doing them anymore he&#39;s still alive</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.799" end="01:03:54.640" style="s2">but yes</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.280" end="01:03:56.319" style="s2">but um he clearly has a team around him</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.640" end="01:03:58.319" style="s2">and they consult with people who</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.319" end="01:04:00.559" style="s2">actually know what</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.319" end="01:04:01.359" style="s2">a compelling evolutionary story is and</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.559" end="01:04:04.319" style="s2">whether that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.359" end="01:04:05.039" style="s2">falsifiable and what isn&#39;t and uh they</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.319" end="01:04:06.640" style="s2">don&#39;t tend</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.039" end="01:04:08.079" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t you don&#39;t tend to see in</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.640" end="01:04:11.359" style="s2">attenborough documentaries</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.079" end="01:04:15.599" style="s2">uh truly bad evolutionary stories</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.359" end="01:04:19.440" style="s2">yep by which i mean unfalsifiable</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.599" end="01:04:21.200" style="s2">some id some id now kova tests are</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.440" end="01:04:22.960" style="s2">performed outdoors</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.200" end="01:04:24.240" style="s2">is it possible that swabbing your nose</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.960" end="01:04:27.359" style="s2">while standing in the sun</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.240" end="01:04:29.839" style="s2">could harm the test results yes yeah</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.359" end="01:04:30.559" style="s2">absolutely i didn&#39;t i didn&#39;t know that</p>

<p begin="01:04:32.160" end="01:04:35.200" style="s2">them were being performed outdoors but</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.359" end="01:04:37.280" style="s2">absolutely you would want to do it under</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.200" end="01:04:38.240" style="s2">some sort of undercover protective yeah</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.280" end="01:04:40.160" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.240" end="01:04:42.400" style="s2">absolutely i mean even then it&#39;s so</p>

<p begin="01:04:48.319" end="01:04:52.960" style="s2">much trouble with the tests</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.839" end="01:04:54.799" style="s2">yep um</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.960" end="01:04:56.640" style="s2">have you considered having a chat with</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.799" end="01:04:57.920" style="s2">judy mkovitz given the parallels between</p>

<p begin="01:04:58.880" end="01:05:03.280" style="s2">nope now we talked we talked about uh</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.119" end="01:05:04.319" style="s2">the pandemic video back</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.280" end="01:05:06.640" style="s2">i don&#39;t even know when it would have</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.319" end="01:05:08.480" style="s2">been sometime in the tens um sometime</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.640" end="01:05:12.000" style="s2">between episode 10 and</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.480" end="01:05:14.880" style="s2">probably 16 uh and uh</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.000" end="01:05:15.839" style="s2">and i don&#39;t know which one it was in but</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.880" end="01:05:18.079" style="s2">go back there and</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.839" end="01:05:18.880" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of misinformation in it so</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.079" end="01:05:22.480" style="s2">much so</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.880" end="01:05:25.119" style="s2">that i just don&#39;t trust the source yep</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.480" end="01:05:25.119" style="s2">uh let&#39;s do</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.400" end="01:05:28.960" style="s2">three more</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.680" end="01:05:34.799" style="s2">two more i can&#39;t there&#39;s a bunch</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.359" end="01:05:37.200" style="s2">cat deserves more screen time that</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.799" end="01:05:38.480" style="s2">doesn&#39;t count as one yes he does but</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.200" end="01:05:40.640" style="s2">not if he&#39;s going to show his butt to</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.480" end="01:05:42.079" style="s2">you guys that wasn&#39;t nice</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.640" end="01:05:43.520" style="s2">okay two more here thoughts on the</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.079" end="01:05:45.920" style="s2">novelty do you have thoughts on the</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.520" end="01:05:48.000" style="s2">novelty of today&#39;s tech monopolies</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.920" end="01:05:50.319" style="s2">versus possibly outdated antitrust</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.000" end="01:05:51.839" style="s2">structures is hyperscalability a novelty</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.319" end="01:05:55.760" style="s2">that could be mistaken for trust or</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.839" end="01:05:57.520" style="s2">anti-competitive behavior of the past</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.760" end="01:05:58.960" style="s2">so this presumably to this this</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.520" end="01:06:00.400" style="s2">wednesday yeah</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.960" end="01:06:02.480" style="s2">yeah there is clearly a parallel the</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.400" end="01:06:04.880" style="s2">parallel is clearly limited</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.480" end="01:06:07.599" style="s2">there&#39;s clearly upside you know we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.880" end="01:06:10.480" style="s2">a novel landscape and so</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.599" end="01:06:11.760" style="s2">in some sense creating a monopoly can</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.480" end="01:06:13.599" style="s2">create a de facto</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.760" end="01:06:15.039" style="s2">standard where a standard may need to</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.599" end="01:06:17.039" style="s2">exist so it&#39;s not like there isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.039" end="01:06:18.160" style="s2">positive outgrowth but the hazard to us</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.039" end="01:06:21.359" style="s2">is also so</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.160" end="01:06:25.039" style="s2">clearly um massive</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.359" end="01:06:26.240" style="s2">that you know we have to figure out how</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.039" end="01:06:30.839" style="s2">to rescue the part</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.240" end="01:06:33.119" style="s2">that is useful um from the part that is</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.839" end="01:06:35.039" style="s2">devastating</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.119" end="01:06:36.880" style="s2">one more question can you please speak</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.039" end="01:06:38.640" style="s2">about blood types why do we have them</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.880" end="01:06:40.400" style="s2">how did they evolve why would oh be more</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.640" end="01:06:42.079" style="s2">resistant to covet 19</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.400" end="01:06:44.000" style="s2">love the podcast thanks for all you do</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.079" end="01:06:45.200" style="s2">from south carolina</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.000" end="01:06:46.799" style="s2">you want to do two minutes on blood</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.200" end="01:06:48.640" style="s2">types are you prepared to i mean we can</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.799" end="01:06:51.280" style="s2">talk a little bit about how they work</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.640" end="01:06:54.079" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s about all yeah i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.280" end="01:06:57.280" style="s2">struggling with my chair today</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.079" end="01:07:01.200" style="s2">all right so your red blood cells have</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.280" end="01:07:04.960" style="s2">so an antigen is a molecular</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.200" end="01:07:05.680" style="s2">signature and your cells have antigens</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.960" end="01:07:08.000" style="s2">sticking</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.680" end="01:07:09.200" style="s2">off of them that is to say a</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.000" end="01:07:11.359" style="s2">distribution of</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.200" end="01:07:12.839" style="s2">positive and negative charges in space</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.359" end="01:07:15.760" style="s2">that is</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.839" end="01:07:19.119" style="s2">unique there are</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.760" end="01:07:20.960" style="s2">two no three that uh</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.119" end="01:07:22.720" style="s2">are found on the surface of human red</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.960" end="01:07:24.640" style="s2">blood cells</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.720" end="01:07:26.640" style="s2">one of them is called a one of them is</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.640" end="01:07:29.920" style="s2">called b and the other one is called the</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.640" end="01:07:33.039" style="s2">rh factor or rhesus factor</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.920" end="01:07:35.680" style="s2">a and b exist at the same place</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.039" end="01:07:37.839" style="s2">in the genome so that you can because</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.680" end="01:07:41.039" style="s2">you have two chromosomes you can have</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.839" end="01:07:43.839" style="s2">an a and the absence of</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.039" end="01:07:44.720" style="s2">a code you can have a b in the absence</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.839" end="01:07:46.960" style="s2">of a code</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.720" end="01:07:48.000" style="s2">you can have an a and a b or you can</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.960" end="01:07:51.039" style="s2">have both</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.000" end="01:07:51.760" style="s2">absences which will give you an o blood</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.039" end="01:07:54.079" style="s2">type</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.760" end="01:07:56.000" style="s2">but basically the blood types are</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.079" end="01:07:57.119" style="s2">described based on the presence of an</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.000" end="01:08:00.319" style="s2">antigen</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.119" end="01:08:01.440" style="s2">so if you have an a a b or an rh factor</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.319" end="01:08:04.160" style="s2">that&#39;s a presence</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.440" end="01:08:05.680" style="s2">and you get o when you have a total</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.160" end="01:08:08.240" style="s2">absence of all of those</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.680" end="01:08:10.400" style="s2">well no an absence of the a and b factor</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.240" end="01:08:13.440" style="s2">and rh is categorized separately</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.400" end="01:08:14.319" style="s2">and so these things create and where</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.440" end="01:08:17.440" style="s2">where is rh</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.319" end="01:08:18.719" style="s2">like where does it it&#39;s not it&#39;s somehow</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.440" end="01:08:19.199" style="s2">in a different part of the genome is</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.719" end="01:08:20.640" style="s2">that all</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.199" end="01:08:22.480" style="s2">or does it is it affixed to a different</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.640" end="01:08:24.159" style="s2">part of the cell as well nope i think</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.480" end="01:08:24.960" style="s2">they&#39;re all over the surface and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.159" end="01:08:28.000" style="s2">just a different</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.960" end="01:08:29.920" style="s2">uh locus okay so you can you can be you</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.000" end="01:08:31.199" style="s2">can have the a antigen or the b antigen</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.920" end="01:08:33.120" style="s2">or both of them or neither</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.199" end="01:08:34.640" style="s2">and you can have the rh antigen or</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.120" end="01:08:35.279" style="s2">neither yeah and if you have for</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.640" end="01:08:38.480" style="s2">instance the b</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.279" end="01:08:39.759" style="s2">antigen and not the rh your b negative</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.480" end="01:08:41.199" style="s2">right that would be your blood type</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.759" end="01:08:42.080" style="s2">positive and negative are about the rh</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.199" end="01:08:45.120" style="s2">factor right</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.080" end="01:08:48.000" style="s2">and so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.120" end="01:08:49.040" style="s2">rule the presence of an antigen triggers</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.000" end="01:08:50.480" style="s2">the immune system</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.040" end="01:08:53.120" style="s2">the immune system is designed to</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.480" end="01:08:54.560" style="s2">recognize that which is not self</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.120" end="01:08:56.799" style="s2">so that is to say your immune system</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.560" end="01:08:58.560" style="s2">will react to something as foreign</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.799" end="01:09:00.400" style="s2">if you yourself don&#39;t make the antigen</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.560" end="01:09:03.440" style="s2">in question so</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.400" end="01:09:06.159" style="s2">if you have a b positive blood</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.440" end="01:09:07.359" style="s2">you carry every antigen what that means</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.159" end="01:09:09.440" style="s2">is you can take blood from</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.359" end="01:09:11.199" style="s2">anybody because no matter what antigens</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.440" end="01:09:11.759" style="s2">they have you will regard it as self</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.199" end="01:09:14.400" style="s2">since you</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.759" end="01:09:15.040" style="s2">produce all of those things if you have</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.400" end="01:09:17.600" style="s2">o</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.040" end="01:09:19.440" style="s2">negative blood then you&#39;re a universal</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.600" end="01:09:21.279" style="s2">donor but you can only take blood from</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.440" end="01:09:23.520" style="s2">another o negative person because</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.279" end="01:09:25.120" style="s2">any antigen will trigger your immune</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.520" end="01:09:27.839" style="s2">system to reject the blood</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.120" end="01:09:29.920" style="s2">if you if you get a negative blood which</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.839" end="01:09:33.199" style="s2">has only one antigen that you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.920" end="01:09:34.080" style="s2">the a um your your body will say that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.199" end="01:09:37.440" style="s2">not self</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.080" end="01:09:40.239" style="s2">respond create antibodies to uh</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.440" end="01:09:41.359" style="s2">to reject it literally fight the tissue</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.239" end="01:09:43.040" style="s2">and kill it yeah</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.359" end="01:09:45.120" style="s2">um which is very dangerous to have</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.040" end="01:09:48.640" style="s2">happening in your bloodstream</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.120" end="01:09:50.880" style="s2">um the rejection of transplanted tissues</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.640" end="01:09:53.759" style="s2">that are not blood is much more complex</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.880" end="01:09:54.480" style="s2">so in some sense this entire abo</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.759" end="01:09:57.920" style="s2">rejection</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.480" end="01:10:01.920" style="s2">donor complex is about</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.920" end="01:10:04.239" style="s2">the simplicity of the antigens found on</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.920" end="01:10:05.760" style="s2">red blood cells in the case of something</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.239" end="01:10:07.679" style="s2">like liver</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.760" end="01:10:09.280" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about a much more complex</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.679" end="01:10:10.800" style="s2">set of antigens so that you need</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.280" end="01:10:13.280" style="s2">a very good match at something called</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.800" end="01:10:14.880" style="s2">the major histocompatibility complex</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.280" end="01:10:16.320" style="s2">which is why you need to go through lots</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.880" end="01:10:17.600" style="s2">of donors rather than there just being a</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.320" end="01:10:19.520" style="s2">liver bank where you can go get one</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.600" end="01:10:23.520" style="s2">that&#39;s a match for you</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.520" end="01:10:25.840" style="s2">so now i know that there are</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.520" end="01:10:27.920" style="s2">very different distributions of</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.840" end="01:10:30.719" style="s2">probabilities for antigens for</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.920" end="01:10:33.040" style="s2">purebred human populations what i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.719" end="01:10:34.719" style="s2">know is what the ancestral state was in</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.040" end="01:10:37.280" style="s2">other words are some of these</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.719" end="01:10:37.920" style="s2">blood types limited to some populations</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.280" end="01:10:40.400" style="s2">and only</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.920" end="01:10:41.920" style="s2">in recent times with human mixing have</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.400" end="01:10:43.679" style="s2">these things spread between them</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.920" end="01:10:45.120" style="s2">or were they always somewhat mixed but</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.679" end="01:10:46.480" style="s2">the prevalences are different between</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.120" end="01:10:48.080" style="s2">populations</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.480" end="01:10:49.760" style="s2">i suspect a good analysis has been done</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.080" end="01:10:51.199" style="s2">but i also don&#39;t know and the only one</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.760" end="01:10:52.960" style="s2">the only sort of</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.199" end="01:10:54.320" style="s2">map that i can pull up in my head right</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.960" end="01:10:56.560" style="s2">now is that</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.320" end="01:10:57.360" style="s2">native american populations meaning you</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.560" end="01:10:58.880" style="s2">know the</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.360" end="01:11:00.560" style="s2">the descendants of the original</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.880" end="01:11:03.360" style="s2">baringians in both north america and</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.560" end="01:11:04.960" style="s2">south america are more likely to be o</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.360" end="01:11:06.560" style="s2">maybe and i don&#39;t know that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.960" end="01:11:08.960" style="s2">actually an rh factor</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.560" end="01:11:10.880" style="s2">specificity there but i know it&#39;s o that</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.960" end="01:11:11.199" style="s2">native americans are much less likely to</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.880" end="01:11:14.480" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.199" end="01:11:15.920" style="s2">a b or a b yeah i would love to know</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.480" end="01:11:17.920" style="s2">what the ancestral state was</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.920" end="01:11:19.760" style="s2">it was purely oh at the point of the</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.920" end="01:11:20.880" style="s2">beringians having descended into the</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.760" end="01:11:22.880" style="s2">americas</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.880" end="01:11:24.159" style="s2">or not yeah so but then the final part</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.880" end="01:11:27.920" style="s2">of this question and then we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.159" end="01:11:30.960" style="s2">we&#39;ll end for today uh is why would o be</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.920" end="01:11:33.120" style="s2">more resistant to cope at 19.</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.960" end="01:11:34.239" style="s2">and especially let me just like add</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.120" end="01:11:36.640" style="s2">something to the question</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.239" end="01:11:38.480" style="s2">um for me like we don&#39;t know the answer</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.640" end="01:11:42.320" style="s2">especially in light of it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.480" end="01:11:44.400" style="s2">that a b and a b are more susceptible to</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.320" end="01:11:46.159" style="s2">covid but if i remember correctly it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.400" end="01:11:47.280" style="s2">that is specifically more susceptible</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.159" end="01:11:50.000" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.280" end="01:11:51.360" style="s2">b and a b blood types are kind of</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.000" end="01:11:52.960" style="s2">neutral kind of in the middle</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.360" end="01:11:54.719" style="s2">so it&#39;s not that like not having</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.960" end="01:11:55.600" style="s2">antigens on your blood versus having</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.719" end="01:11:57.600" style="s2">antigens</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.600" end="01:11:59.280" style="s2">makes you susceptible or not it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.600" end="01:12:02.320" style="s2">very specific one that makes you</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.280" end="01:12:03.920" style="s2">uh more susceptible versus having none</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.320" end="01:12:05.440" style="s2">that makes you more resistant or less</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.920" end="01:12:08.000" style="s2">susceptible yeah</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.440" end="01:12:09.199" style="s2">um i don&#39;t know i think the thing the</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.000" end="01:12:11.440" style="s2">first thing i would like to know in</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.199" end="01:12:14.640" style="s2">order to answer the question</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.440" end="01:12:16.080" style="s2">there is reason to think that red blood</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.640" end="01:12:19.840" style="s2">cells probably do</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.080" end="01:12:21.520" style="s2">not get infected that is to say even if</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.840" end="01:12:23.199" style="s2">virus gets into red blood cells that it</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.520" end="01:12:25.679" style="s2">cannot reproduce itself</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.199" end="01:12:26.800" style="s2">but that is not dead certain so is that</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.679" end="01:12:29.360" style="s2">because they&#39;re a nucleate</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.800" end="01:12:32.000" style="s2">yeah so red blood cells in mammals have</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.360" end="01:12:35.040" style="s2">no nucleus</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.000" end="01:12:36.880" style="s2">but the coronaviruses do not integrate</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.040" end="01:12:38.560" style="s2">into the nuclear genome and so it is</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.880" end="01:12:40.400" style="s2">possible that they have</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.560" end="01:12:42.239" style="s2">ribosomal components that would allow a</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.400" end="01:12:44.159" style="s2">virus to</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.239" end="01:12:46.080" style="s2">replicate itself even though it has no</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.159" end="01:12:47.360" style="s2">nucleus and i would like to know whether</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.080" end="01:12:48.840" style="s2">that happens or doesn&#39;t it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.360" end="01:12:50.320" style="s2">we should we should be able to look that</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.840" end="01:12:53.679" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.320" end="01:12:54.480" style="s2">in which case it would almost certainly</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.679" end="01:12:58.640" style="s2">have to do</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.480" end="01:13:00.800" style="s2">with the difference in ability to enter</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.640" end="01:13:02.840" style="s2">a red blood cell based on the antigens</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.800" end="01:13:05.440" style="s2">on its surface</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.840" end="01:13:06.719" style="s2">um uh but anyway i guess we&#39;ll have to</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.440" end="01:13:10.000" style="s2">return to it after we know</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.719" end="01:13:13.280" style="s2">yeah interesting question yep</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.000" end="01:13:16.840" style="s2">and i think we&#39;re done all right so</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.280" end="01:13:20.320" style="s2">um probably we&#39;ll be back on tuesday</p>
