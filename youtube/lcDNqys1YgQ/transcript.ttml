<p begin="00:01:32.020" end="00:01:36.520" style="s2">little bit in the beginning so I hope it</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.579" end="00:01:38.590" style="s2">didn&#39;t doesn&#39;t distract too much but I</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.520" end="00:01:43.619" style="s2">had to go back and forth so few</p>

<p begin="00:01:55.299" end="00:02:02.690" style="s2">now I propose in the email we sent</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.130" end="00:02:06.369" style="s2">around that we use this four-way yellow</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.690" end="00:02:08.860" style="s2">goes to try and follow up on the two</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.369" end="00:02:13.250" style="s2">dialogues that Jordan and I had</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.860" end="00:02:15.920" style="s2">centering around the notion of something</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.250" end="00:02:18.500" style="s2">like a Socratic faith and Chris and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.920" end="00:02:21.800" style="s2">also recently had a very good discussion</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.500" end="00:02:23.510" style="s2">with Andrew Sweeney around this and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.800" end="00:02:24.560" style="s2">these three discussions are very much on</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.510" end="00:02:27.260" style="s2">my mind right now</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.560" end="00:02:31.370" style="s2">and what Socratic faith might look like</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.260" end="00:02:32.780" style="s2">and why it might be needed here in our</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.370" end="00:02:36.500" style="s2">current situation Jordan and I have been</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.780" end="00:02:41.269" style="s2">exploring that and what its relations</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.500" end="00:02:44.330" style="s2">are too closely attending notions such</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.269" end="00:02:45.890" style="s2">as wisdom aspiration and perhaps also</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.330" end="00:02:48.680" style="s2">the religion that&#39;s not a religion these</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.890" end="00:02:50.320" style="s2">are all the things as sort of I proposed</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.680" end="00:02:52.820" style="s2">that we might sort of put on the table</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.320" end="00:02:56.959" style="s2">for discussion right now how does that</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.820" end="00:03:01.280" style="s2">sound for the rest of you for today that</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.959" end="00:03:03.049" style="s2">sounds really good and in weaving in</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.280" end="00:03:05.720" style="s2">with that which actually I think maybe</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.049" end="00:03:11.470" style="s2">makes what you&#39;re talking about more</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.720" end="00:03:13.880" style="s2">even more salient and more pertinent</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.470" end="00:03:20.510" style="s2">which is something that&#39;s really stuck</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.880" end="00:03:24.290" style="s2">with me and I think he just said it out</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.510" end="00:03:26.540" style="s2">of just spontaneously or just in finding</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.290" end="00:03:30.829" style="s2">his speech in one of his videos Johanna</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.540" end="00:03:32.959" style="s2">said he said mark something like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.829" end="00:03:37.609" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of funny being a philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.959" end="00:03:40.900" style="s2">where where a philosopher has some as</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.609" end="00:03:44.540" style="s2">something to say that&#39;s actually timely</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.900" end="00:03:47.690" style="s2">and I&#39;ve that&#39;s really sunk in this</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.540" end="00:03:50.720" style="s2">sense of that work that we&#39;re in a time</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.690" end="00:03:54.530" style="s2">right now that it may be such that what</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.720" end="00:03:58.030" style="s2">a philosopher says speaks to the time</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.530" end="00:04:03.880" style="s2">that we&#39;re in in a direct way</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.030" end="00:04:06.400" style="s2">I think so I think I I was with a I was</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.880" end="00:04:09.190" style="s2">peter lindbergh it&#39;s creating an online</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.400" end="00:04:11.020" style="s2">store and we were and I was asked to</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.190" end="00:04:12.790" style="s2">speak I think Jordan you did yours today</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.020" end="00:04:16.450" style="s2">didn&#39;t you do your another situational I</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.790" end="00:04:18.579" style="s2">did yeah so right the one I did last</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.450" end="00:04:20.880" style="s2">night was on the meaning Kairos and what</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.579" end="00:04:23.770" style="s2">this might be doing to shake you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.880" end="00:04:27.520" style="s2">Kairos is Telex notion drawn from</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.770" end="00:04:29.500" style="s2">miltonic Christianity of a timing of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.520" end="00:04:33.580" style="s2">sense of a constellation of events that</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.500" end="00:04:34.840" style="s2">make radical transformation so for you</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.580" end="00:04:36.370" style="s2">know extended periods of time a system</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.840" end="00:04:38.530" style="s2">is very stable it has a lot of inertia</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.370" end="00:04:40.690" style="s2">it&#39;s very it&#39;s very resistant to</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.530" end="00:04:42.400" style="s2">significant change but in Kairos the</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.690" end="00:04:43.840" style="s2">conditions come together it&#39;s analogous</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.400" end="00:04:46.270" style="s2">it&#39;s not the same but it&#39;s analogous to</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.840" end="00:04:49.090" style="s2">criticality in complex systems theory</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.270" end="00:04:51.940" style="s2">the conditions consulate in such a way</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.090" end="00:04:53.050" style="s2">that radical change is possible and part</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.940" end="00:04:55.210" style="s2">of what Jordan and I were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.050" end="00:04:58.360" style="s2">is the kind of knowing and the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.210" end="00:05:02.380" style="s2">faith perhaps that is relevant to being</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.360" end="00:05:04.180" style="s2">able to pick up on Kairos and the reason</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.380" end="00:05:07.570" style="s2">why I mention this to you guys because I</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.180" end="00:05:08.979" style="s2">think totally thought that notion at</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.570" end="00:05:10.720" style="s2">least it seems to be in his own work</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.979" end="00:05:12.340" style="s2">he&#39;s exemplifying it is where the</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.720" end="00:05:14.560" style="s2">philosopher and the prophet in the Old</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.340" end="00:05:17.200" style="s2">Testament sense not in the pour teller</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.560" end="00:05:18.430" style="s2">of the future but the philosopher and</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.200" end="00:05:20.320" style="s2">the prophet and of course there are</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.430" end="00:05:21.250" style="s2">figures that embody both Nietzsche comes</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.320" end="00:05:24.900" style="s2">readily to mind</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.250" end="00:05:28.419" style="s2">Heidegger constructively to mind right</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.900" end="00:05:31.060" style="s2">the philosopher prophet is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.419" end="00:05:32.950" style="s2">particularly pertinent individual during</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.060" end="00:05:34.660" style="s2">these times of Kairos I think you</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.950" end="00:05:38.740" style="s2">harness this notion of how we are</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.660" end="00:05:40.600" style="s2">collapsed back on to you know the</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.740" end="00:05:42.850" style="s2">subjectivity that has been so valorized</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.600" end="00:05:44.680" style="s2">and raised to such a huge metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.850" end="00:05:47.680" style="s2">level in our culture only to find that</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.680" end="00:05:49.510" style="s2">subjectivity incredibly shallow in its</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.680" end="00:05:52.330" style="s2">resources and its resiliency for</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.510" end="00:05:54.940" style="s2">effecting what we need in order to</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.330" end="00:05:56.890" style="s2">respond to the to this biological threat</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.940" end="00:05:59.110" style="s2">I think that&#39;s a very telling an</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.890" end="00:06:00.850" style="s2">important thing so I really and I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.110" end="00:06:02.470" style="s2">I&#39;m suggesting a way we can weave them</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.850" end="00:06:04.300" style="s2">together yes</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.470" end="00:06:08.710" style="s2">and I and I and I think the way that we</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.300" end="00:06:10.960" style="s2">had been talking about philosophy as in</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.710" end="00:06:11.360" style="s2">the original sense of the word of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.960" end="00:06:14.719" style="s2">prime</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.360" end="00:06:19.729" style="s2">sense of the word as as dialog owes as</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.719" end="00:06:24.800" style="s2">philosophy as the process of disclosure</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.729" end="00:06:28.250" style="s2">of what&#39;s beyond beyond and of us so I</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.800" end="00:06:30.469" style="s2">in in having had a an experience and I</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.250" end="00:06:32.539" style="s2">was telling Chris about this and this</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.469" end="00:06:37.490" style="s2">when I wrote this email for us to get</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.539" end="00:06:39.080" style="s2">together I was I had a circling weekend</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.490" end="00:06:41.569" style="s2">online so we&#39;re doing everything online</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.080" end="00:06:43.360" style="s2">now and it&#39;s actually working out like a</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.569" end="00:06:45.919" style="s2">lot better than I thought it would and</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.360" end="00:06:50.689" style="s2">so just basically when you lead a circle</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.919" end="00:06:53.120" style="s2">you&#39;re basically zeroing in on relevance</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.689" end="00:06:55.939" style="s2">basically you know Jeff continually</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.120" end="00:06:58.310" style="s2">finding the sweet spot between chaos and</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.939" end="00:06:59.930" style="s2">order K and relevance and going up and</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.310" end="00:07:02.840" style="s2">tracking all the stuff that we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.930" end="00:07:09.949" style="s2">so you&#39;re doing that for 10 hours a day</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.840" end="00:07:14.949" style="s2">and I got done and I would imagine all</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.949" end="00:07:19.219" style="s2">of the all of those those yoga stretches</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.949" end="00:07:21.800" style="s2">so all my machinery is just and then I</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.219" end="00:07:24.710" style="s2">turned on the news and it was funny</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.800" end="00:07:28.250" style="s2">because it was for me anyways that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.710" end="00:07:30.379" style="s2">moment where it turned like where I was</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.250" end="00:07:33.219" style="s2">like this became less abstract lunch</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.379" end="00:07:35.710" style="s2">room from something kind of abstract to</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.219" end="00:07:40.969" style="s2">whoa this actually could change</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.710" end="00:07:43.400" style="s2">everybody&#39;s life mmm and in that turn</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.969" end="00:07:47.569" style="s2">from that state it was so interesting</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.400" end="00:07:50.479" style="s2">because I felt myself go like take it in</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.569" end="00:07:53.210" style="s2">and then back back back back back back</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.479" end="00:07:58.819" style="s2">back back and I just felt myself go so</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.210" end="00:08:03.620" style="s2">far back in context to to feel into the</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.819" end="00:08:06.319" style="s2">place to respond from hmm and in a way</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.620" end="00:08:08.930" style="s2">they just kept inviting whatever was</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.319" end="00:08:12.560" style="s2">happening as it was happening but also I</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.930" end="00:08:15.199" style="s2">just felt a sense of like what is what</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.560" end="00:08:17.689" style="s2">am I actually what am I actually looking</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.199" end="00:08:19.610" style="s2">at when I&#39;m when I&#39;m when I&#39;m getting</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.689" end="00:08:22.849" style="s2">this what is this crisis that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.610" end="00:08:25.220" style="s2">talking about exactly and I got this</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.849" end="00:08:28.460" style="s2">sense of I had this feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.220" end="00:08:30.860" style="s2">being an ant on the back of an elephants</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.460" end="00:08:33.080" style="s2">right they can see an inch in front of</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.860" end="00:08:35.030" style="s2">it they&#39;ve just discovered that it</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.080" end="00:08:41.930" style="s2">wasn&#39;t even an elephant it didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.030" end="00:08:43.640" style="s2">that it was walking on and from and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.930" end="00:08:45.200" style="s2">as I started to think about about it</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.640" end="00:08:46.520" style="s2">afterwards so I started thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.200" end="00:08:49.190" style="s2">well there&#39;s probably gonna be many</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.520" end="00:08:51.320" style="s2">phases to this right there&#39;s the phase</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.190" end="00:08:54.860" style="s2">that we&#39;re in right now which is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.320" end="00:08:56.240" style="s2">immediacy of the crisis right which I</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.860" end="00:08:58.550" style="s2">think that you guys have alluded to</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.240" end="00:09:01.880" style="s2">where there&#39;s a burst there&#39;s a burst of</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.550" end="00:09:05.990" style="s2">energy and meaningfulness of importance</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.880" end="00:09:08.930" style="s2">because of the change but the thing I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.990" end="00:09:11.900" style="s2">the thing I&#39;m I think chris has alluded</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.930" end="00:09:14.120" style="s2">this to this as well that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.900" end="00:09:15.590" style="s2">another there depending on how things go</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.120" end="00:09:17.750" style="s2">it seems to me that there&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.590" end="00:09:19.550" style="s2">another phase to this right which is</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.750" end="00:09:24.620" style="s2">actually going to be the revealing of</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.550" end="00:09:27.230" style="s2">the molasse the malaise underneath all</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.620" end="00:09:30.020" style="s2">the structures that are being like are</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.230" end="00:09:32.630" style="s2">being shown their instability right and</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.020" end="00:09:35.450" style="s2">are crumbling and that where that sense</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.630" end="00:09:37.370" style="s2">of emergency or our ability to respond</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.450" end="00:09:40.310" style="s2">we may not be able to respond in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.370" end="00:09:42.260" style="s2">ways that we always used to and I have a</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.310" end="00:09:47.480" style="s2">feeling what we&#39;re gonna start to do is</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.260" end="00:09:52.160" style="s2">feel like feel what was just what was</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.480" end="00:09:54.830" style="s2">concealed in in all of our foot all of</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.160" end="00:09:59.440" style="s2">everything functioning well right this</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.830" end="00:10:01.540" style="s2">kind of sense of of molasse right and</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.440" end="00:10:05.000" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.540" end="00:10:07.310" style="s2">despair and despondency you know in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.000" end="00:10:12.290" style="s2">sense of kind of waking up to something</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.310" end="00:10:14.900" style="s2">that that that was covered over and from</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.290" end="00:10:18.890" style="s2">there I started to feel into the sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.900" end="00:10:23.180" style="s2">of wow you know maybe right now and in</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.890" end="00:10:27.370" style="s2">the video that that John and Chris did</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.180" end="00:10:30.380" style="s2">with Andrew Chris you said something</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.370" end="00:10:32.420" style="s2">that were you were kind of positioning</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.380" end="00:10:35.530" style="s2">the stay at the place that were in that</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.420" end="00:10:37.820" style="s2">that maybe this is the time were where a</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.530" end="00:10:40.990" style="s2">philosophical I think it was I wrote it</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.820" end="00:10:40.990" style="s2">down a philosophical</p>

<p begin="00:10:47.899" end="00:10:54.779" style="s2">my sense is is is this whole thing about</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.239" end="00:10:58.319" style="s2">the religion that&#39;s not a religion dialo</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.779" end="00:11:03.029" style="s2">goes and this particular time and then I</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.319" end="00:11:05.489" style="s2">heard Jordan you talk about this notion</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.029" end="00:11:08.119" style="s2">of the can visit the campfire or the</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.489" end="00:11:08.119" style="s2">talking fire</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.149" end="00:11:13.859" style="s2">yeah the campfire yeah this Brett&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.009" end="00:11:16.649" style="s2">campfire yeah the Brett&#39;s campfire and I</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.859" end="00:11:22.559" style="s2">love that image right and this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.649" end="00:11:24.599" style="s2">what we&#39;ve been doing so far maybe this</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.559" end="00:11:28.229" style="s2">is the time to really kind of strike</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.599" end="00:11:30.449" style="s2">around that is to really start to in to</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.229" end="00:11:33.989" style="s2">figure out the constraints the right</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.449" end="00:11:36.989" style="s2">constraints for these dialogue OSes</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.989" end="00:11:39.869" style="s2">start to - and then distribute them and</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.989" end="00:11:45.269" style="s2">get them going in this time such that</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.869" end="00:11:47.639" style="s2">when when that malaise comes in we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.269" end="00:11:50.819" style="s2">have something to actually start to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.639" end="00:11:53.819" style="s2">able to to to with faith go deep into it</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.819" end="00:11:56.339" style="s2">in a meaningful way distributed so I</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.819" end="00:11:59.279" style="s2">just had a sense of just like that was</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.339" end="00:12:01.559" style="s2">my experience of watching the news and</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.279" end="00:12:04.229" style="s2">how I&#39;ve been making sense of it since</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.559" end="00:12:11.339" style="s2">then and what&#39;s what had me write the</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.229" end="00:12:15.269" style="s2">email going okay let&#39;s let&#39;s me my</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.339" end="00:12:18.119" style="s2">concern personal the campfire image I</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.269" end="00:12:19.499" style="s2">was trying to remember whose it was one</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.119" end="00:12:22.169" style="s2">of the people that was I was in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.499" end="00:12:26.189" style="s2">group last night a rebel wisdom thing I</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.169" end="00:12:28.889" style="s2">believe it was was talking about how</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.189" end="00:12:30.599" style="s2">this medium is very different because</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.889" end="00:12:34.799" style="s2">what you get is you get people&#39;s faces</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.599" end="00:12:36.929" style="s2">much closer in some ways and so if I was</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.799" end="00:12:39.659" style="s2">this guy of you if your face was filming</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.929" end="00:12:41.039" style="s2">me this much of my normal we&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.659" end="00:12:42.959" style="s2">extremely close and it&#39;d be kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.039" end="00:12:44.999" style="s2">socially awkward situation probably for</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.959" end="00:12:47.519" style="s2">us but because of the way the technology</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.999" end="00:12:50.279" style="s2">works it&#39;s it the grammars changed and</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.519" end="00:12:51.320" style="s2">acceptable we&#39;re all and this goes back</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.279" end="00:12:52.880" style="s2">to Jordan&#39;s point</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.320" end="00:12:54.740" style="s2">before we start recording we&#39;re all in</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.880" end="00:12:56.300" style="s2">this weird space where we&#39;re not where</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.740" end="00:12:57.620" style="s2">we&#39;re all sort of equally close and</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.300" end="00:13:01.280" style="s2">equally distant from each other they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.620" end="00:13:03.800" style="s2">right it&#39;s a weird space and so I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.280" end="00:13:05.600" style="s2">one of the things she was bringing up in</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.800" end="00:13:08.270" style="s2">it and then I made a connection to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.600" end="00:13:10.220" style="s2">campfire was that this is having an</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.270" end="00:13:12.950" style="s2">impact it&#39;s creating a new grammar of</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.220" end="00:13:15.500" style="s2">intimacy and relatedness the medium</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.950" end="00:13:18.260" style="s2">itself is doing that to a certain degree</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.500" end="00:13:19.610" style="s2">and then I suggested and I couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.260" end="00:13:22.220" style="s2">remember the name so Jordan thank you</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.610" end="00:13:24.530" style="s2">for bringing it up I suggested that what</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.220" end="00:13:26.000" style="s2">it&#39;s doing is it&#39;s exacting the thing</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.530" end="00:13:27.530" style="s2">that&#39;s most analogous to us maybe this</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.000" end="00:13:30.020" style="s2">is how Bret came up with the metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.530" end="00:13:32.600" style="s2">from our evolutionary history is when we</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.020" end="00:13:34.550" style="s2">sat around the campfire in the campfire</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.600" end="00:13:37.370" style="s2">we were that close they&#39;re all oriented</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.550" end="00:13:39.560" style="s2">inward where there was no circle so we</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.370" end="00:13:41.180" style="s2">pretty much equidistant and because of</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.560" end="00:13:43.250" style="s2">the way campfires work our faces are</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.180" end="00:13:45.350" style="s2">particularly lit and then everything</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.250" end="00:13:47.090" style="s2">around us is quickly fading off in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.350" end="00:13:48.740" style="s2">darkness and Matt Rossano argued you</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.090" end="00:13:50.360" style="s2">know that we&#39;ve evolved across several</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.740" end="00:13:54.290" style="s2">species for a hundred thousands of years</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.360" end="00:13:56.450" style="s2">to sit around campfires and that that</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.290" end="00:13:58.400" style="s2">had probably huge selective effects on</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.450" end="00:14:01.610" style="s2">our cognition he actually proposes that</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.400" end="00:14:04.190" style="s2">we we gain the capacity for meditation</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.610" end="00:14:07.940" style="s2">because we sat for generations around</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.190" end="00:14:12.280" style="s2">campfires so it&#39;s a possibility that</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.940" end="00:14:15.380" style="s2">this medium is exacting that primordial</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.280" end="00:14:18.440" style="s2">kind of intimacy and we haven&#39;t had that</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.380" end="00:14:20.480" style="s2">kind of thing available to us and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.440" end="00:14:23.210" style="s2">really interesting the way of juxtaposes</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.480" end="00:14:24.620" style="s2">something very primordial with something</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.210" end="00:14:26.780" style="s2">very sort of cutting edge because this</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.620" end="00:14:28.190" style="s2">is an amazing technology and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.780" end="00:14:30.290" style="s2">an interesting symbol on it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.190" end="00:14:32.480" style="s2">interesting to joining of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.290" end="00:14:34.790" style="s2">reaching deep in door ancestry and then</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.480" end="00:14:37.340" style="s2">pulling us you know into the precipice</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.790" end="00:14:38.600" style="s2">of the future so I want to I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.340" end="00:14:40.160" style="s2">there&#39;s something right about that and I</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.600" end="00:14:42.530" style="s2">think that&#39;s contributing to the Kairos</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.160" end="00:14:43.700" style="s2">I&#39;ve been calling the virtual campfires</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.530" end="00:14:47.240" style="s2">I don&#39;t know what that calls and so I</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.700" end="00:14:50.660" style="s2">don&#39;t want to steal his term but but I</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.240" end="00:14:52.550" style="s2">have a concern I think you&#39;re right guy</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.660" end="00:14:54.890" style="s2">that there&#39;s a very real possibility</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.550" end="00:14:56.750" style="s2">that Chris&#39;s thesis you know that the</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.890" end="00:14:58.550" style="s2">crisis is causing you know very much a</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.750" end="00:15:02.290" style="s2">reciprocal narrowing for people a kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.550" end="00:15:04.760" style="s2">of Dom aside they&#39;re getting into a a</p>

<p begin="00:15:07.199" end="00:15:12.990" style="s2">meaning in life and that once all of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.389" end="00:15:16.649" style="s2">urgency is passed and we just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.990" end="00:15:19.939" style="s2">settle in to survival endurance I agree</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.649" end="00:15:23.310" style="s2">that that malaise can come forward I</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.939" end="00:15:24.990" style="s2">think it&#39;s a Kairos though sorry I won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.310" end="00:15:27.120" style="s2">talk too much longer on this but I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.990" end="00:15:29.939" style="s2">it&#39;s a Kairos in that like most Kairos</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.120" end="00:15:31.680" style="s2">is it&#39;s it&#39;s multivalent it&#39;s multi apt</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.939" end="00:15:33.810" style="s2">for sending us in many different</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.680" end="00:15:35.430" style="s2">directions I think the response we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.810" end="00:15:38.579" style="s2">gonna get to it</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.430" end="00:15:40.500" style="s2">is gonna be complex I think yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.579" end="00:15:42.089" style="s2">some people I&#39;ve already seen the</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.500" end="00:15:45.029" style="s2">language and this came up in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.089" end="00:15:47.399" style="s2">discussion with Andrew you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.029" end="00:15:49.800" style="s2">the virus also triggers a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.399" end="00:15:52.649" style="s2">mythological grammar that&#39;s hardwired</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.800" end="00:15:54.269" style="s2">into us about demonic agents that are</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.649" end="00:15:57.689" style="s2">ubiquitous in the world and they can</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.269" end="00:15:59.550" style="s2">strike us in an unpredictable way and</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.689" end="00:16:00.990" style="s2">yet we can&#39;t see them and they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.550" end="00:16:05.279" style="s2">seem to be making you know but they may</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.990" end="00:16:08.100" style="s2">appear right and so that&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.279" end="00:16:12.600" style="s2">mythological nostalgia I think is coming</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.100" end="00:16:14.189" style="s2">out for some people and that&#39;s that can</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.600" end="00:16:16.589" style="s2">be reinforced by the fact that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.189" end="00:16:18.629" style="s2">enforcing a purity code we&#39;re enforcing</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.589" end="00:16:20.670" style="s2">a purity code and so sort of you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.629" end="00:16:23.610" style="s2">Old Testament you know ubiquitous</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.670" end="00:16:26.040" style="s2">threatening deity and purity codes</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.610" end="00:16:28.199" style="s2">that&#39;s hardwired into us in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.040" end="00:16:29.279" style="s2">and you have to be these culturally so</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.199" end="00:16:34.889" style="s2">we have to be careful I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.279" end="00:16:37.559" style="s2">gonna be a real possibility come back</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.889" end="00:16:39.509" style="s2">I think people trying to alleviate the</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.559" end="00:16:42.360" style="s2">anxiety with premature closure and</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.509" end="00:16:44.399" style="s2">claiming a certainty of a certain</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.360" end="00:16:46.199" style="s2">ideological prediction I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.399" end="00:16:47.550" style="s2">going to be another thing that&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.199" end="00:16:50.610" style="s2">to come up</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.550" end="00:16:53.459" style="s2">I think people seeking for some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.610" end="00:16:55.620" style="s2">integration of those potentially maybe</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.459" end="00:16:57.360" style="s2">as somewhat nefarious interconnection in</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.620" end="00:16:59.579" style="s2">which they propose various kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.360" end="00:17:01.949" style="s2">comforting Gnostic like conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.579" end="00:17:05.159" style="s2">conspiracy narratives in order to try</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.949" end="00:17:08.939" style="s2">and alleviate this and give right some</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.159" end="00:17:12.480" style="s2">give a face to the demon as well as you</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.939" end="00:17:14.610" style="s2">know make a give us a plan of action for</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.480" end="00:17:16.439" style="s2">the eutrophic future I think all of that</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.610" end="00:17:19.380" style="s2">I think those are all very real</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.439" end="00:17:22.290" style="s2">possibilities ah I see may see it forms</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.380" end="00:17:25.440" style="s2">them already taking place so I think the</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.290" end="00:17:28.370" style="s2">malaise is going to be interacting with</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.440" end="00:17:32.490" style="s2">these other factors there&#39;s in a very</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.370" end="00:17:37.730" style="s2">very very and so I think the</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.490" end="00:17:37.730" style="s2">philosophical task is to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.690" end="00:17:45.300" style="s2">engage the philosophy and exemplify it</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.460" end="00:17:50.400" style="s2">in such a way that we can steer through</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.300" end="00:17:52.100" style="s2">that complexity yep they happen and when</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.400" end="00:17:55.080" style="s2">I say that I&#39;m picking up on Jordans</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.100" end="00:17:57.540" style="s2">metaphor for the Socratic faith of you</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.080" end="00:18:02.330" style="s2">know surfing the wave of uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.540" end="00:18:08.070" style="s2">sailing through the storm of uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.330" end="00:18:11.130" style="s2">so I think we we have to be very</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.070" end="00:18:12.360" style="s2">Socratic about our faith I think so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.130" end="00:18:14.160" style="s2">going to add something to what Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.360" end="00:18:16.050" style="s2">our timer it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s this it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.160" end="00:18:18.360" style="s2">integrity and the ability to sense and</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.050" end="00:18:20.070" style="s2">find the flow but there&#39;s also an</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.360" end="00:18:21.270" style="s2">element of the Socratic in here because</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.070" end="00:18:23.700" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna get various competing</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.270" end="00:18:25.770" style="s2">worldviews and ways of life that I kind</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.700" end="00:18:27.660" style="s2">of come to the fore and what one of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.770" end="00:18:30.630" style="s2">things Socrates does is he doesn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.660" end="00:18:33.630" style="s2">put a competition of arguments out he</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.630" end="00:18:35.430" style="s2">puts he exemplifies a competition of</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.630" end="00:18:39.150" style="s2">ways of life where Kowski makes this</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.430" end="00:18:41.910" style="s2">argument very clearly and that&#39;s why we</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.150" end="00:18:45.510" style="s2">have to exemplify what we&#39;re doing as</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.910" end="00:18:47.220" style="s2">much as talk about it it&#39;s like sorry</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.510" end="00:18:48.690" style="s2">this is I&#39;m not I&#39;m not capturing the</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.220" end="00:18:52.680" style="s2">importance of what I&#39;m trying to convey</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.690" end="00:18:55.560" style="s2">here but the deal logos form is is</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.680" end="00:18:59.220" style="s2">almost as important as anything we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.560" end="00:19:02.040" style="s2">trying to say because of its capacity</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.220" end="00:19:06.630" style="s2">for bringing ways of life or as you put</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.040" end="00:19:12.570" style="s2">a guy getting worlds into right a you</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.630" end="00:19:14.310" style="s2">know a viable enacted comparison so that</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.570" end="00:19:15.900" style="s2">we can actually not just have a</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.310" end="00:19:18.780" style="s2">competition in the good sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.900" end="00:19:20.340" style="s2">word arguments but a competition of ways</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.780" end="00:19:23.220" style="s2">of life because that&#39;s what we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.340" end="00:19:24.840" style="s2">need I think to steers through the car</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.220" end="00:19:26.340" style="s2">us and so Jordan that&#39;s why I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.840" end="00:19:28.800" style="s2">to broaden the notion of faith that we</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.340" end="00:19:31.170" style="s2">discussed you to capture some of this</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.800" end="00:19:32.290" style="s2">other Socratic element that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.170" end="00:19:37.080" style="s2">want to be clear about that</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.290" end="00:19:39.580" style="s2">yeah what I&#39;m hearing when you say that</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.080" end="00:19:40.780" style="s2">actually perhaps or maybe go back to</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.580" end="00:19:42.340" style="s2">date because there&#39;s a few things in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.780" end="00:19:43.810" style="s2">previous conversations that I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.340" end="00:19:47.620" style="s2">just sort of pluck all the strings you</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.810" end="00:19:49.930" style="s2">tone when the word philosopher is</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.620" end="00:19:52.270" style="s2">brought up I get the feelin Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.930" end="00:19:55.240" style="s2">and desire to distinguish between the</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.270" end="00:19:57.850" style="s2">bookworm Quibbler and that individual</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.240" end="00:20:00.700" style="s2">who is holding the shamanic lineage in</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.850" end="00:20:02.740" style="s2">the contemporary environment he said</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.700" end="00:20:04.120" style="s2">that we have Brett&#39;s campfire invoked we</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.740" end="00:20:05.830" style="s2">have the shaman sitting around the</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.120" end="00:20:08.350" style="s2">campfire playing drums and we have our</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.830" end="00:20:09.400" style="s2">modern environment right now yep now</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.350" end="00:20:11.580" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting about our modern</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.400" end="00:20:15.160" style="s2">environment is part of the shearing</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.580" end="00:20:18.970" style="s2">against our systemic dynamics a very</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.160" end="00:20:20.410" style="s2">painful sheeran has been the need to</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.970" end="00:20:23.230" style="s2">bring the virtual into right</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.410" end="00:20:25.710" style="s2">relationship with the physical we are</p>

<p begin="00:20:25.710" end="00:20:29.920" style="s2">confusion the virtual has been emerging</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.390" end="00:20:31.810" style="s2">and emerging in a very disruptive</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.920" end="00:20:34.360" style="s2">fashion but not integrated into a</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.810" end="00:20:35.830" style="s2">wholeness of life and of course as we</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.360" end="00:20:38.170" style="s2">were mentioned earlier that we reach of</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.830" end="00:20:41.440" style="s2">this now feeling quite deeply I am at</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.170" end="00:20:43.510" style="s2">home I am in a place away from social</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.440" end="00:20:45.880" style="s2">interaction like my social interaction</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.510" end="00:20:47.440" style="s2">is very much of two very distinct kinds</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.880" end="00:20:49.060" style="s2">there&#39;s no confusion I&#39;m either</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.440" end="00:20:51.570" style="s2">interacting with my family and with</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.060" end="00:20:53.680" style="s2">nature while I&#39;m in the virtual sphere</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.570" end="00:20:55.270" style="s2">and there&#39;s no in between the two so</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.680" end="00:20:57.850" style="s2">that that that fact creates a really</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.270" end="00:20:59.350" style="s2">nice crispness of these two very</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.850" end="00:21:02.340" style="s2">distinct lineages right you have an</p>

<p begin="00:21:02.340" end="00:21:09.250" style="s2">you&#39;ve got complete trans physical</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.460" end="00:21:10.570" style="s2">virtual and they&#39;re both like isolated</p>

<p begin="00:21:10.570" end="00:21:15.760" style="s2">occurring so I suspect that part of the</p>

<p begin="00:28:46.320" end="00:28:51.510" style="s2">something about what the campfire does</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.910" end="00:28:53.610" style="s2">is that it plays host to both the</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.510" end="00:28:56.700" style="s2">darkness and the light it plays host to</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.610" end="00:28:59.610" style="s2">both the interior life of the individual</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.700" end="00:29:01.710" style="s2">and the communal life of our sociability</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.610" end="00:29:02.730" style="s2">and it does that simultaneously even if</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.710" end="00:29:05.520" style="s2">you think about the imagery of a</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.730" end="00:29:08.580" style="s2">campfire right every bed there is only</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.520" end="00:29:10.500" style="s2">darkness except for the individual faces</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.580" end="00:29:13.320" style="s2">of the people gathered around you right</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.500" end="00:29:15.420" style="s2">so we are both in solitude and in</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.320" end="00:29:16.380" style="s2">communion at the same time one of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.420" end="00:29:19.080" style="s2">things that we&#39;re going to learn how to</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.380" end="00:29:22.440" style="s2">learn how to do especially right now is</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.080" end="00:29:24.330" style="s2">how to treat ourselves in solitude and</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.440" end="00:29:25.950" style="s2">have to treat one another one so it</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.330" end="00:29:27.660" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing this right now people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.950" end="00:29:30.020" style="s2">know how to deal with solitude because</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.660" end="00:29:32.790" style="s2">we have been trained how to deal walls</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.020" end="00:29:34.110" style="s2">that&#39;s why as soon as there&#39;s a call for</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.790" end="00:29:36.690" style="s2">people to cloister themselves their</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.110" end="00:29:38.670" style="s2">immediate impulse is to deny the</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.690" end="00:29:40.380" style="s2">solitude and do their best</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.670" end="00:29:42.090" style="s2">sometimes playfully and sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.380" end="00:29:44.940" style="s2">amusingly but still people are doing</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.090" end="00:29:46.320" style="s2">their utmost to try and avoid the</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.940" end="00:29:49.260" style="s2">solitude that they&#39;ve been faced with</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.320" end="00:29:51.840" style="s2">right to spend every waking hour of</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.260" end="00:29:55.140" style="s2">their day in conversation with people</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.840" end="00:29:56.850" style="s2">right on the phone over video on their</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.140" end="00:29:59.370" style="s2">balconies right I mean it&#39;s becoming</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.850" end="00:30:01.290" style="s2">like a meme that&#39;s circulating the</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.370" end="00:30:04.110" style="s2">creative ways in which people are trying</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.290" end="00:30:05.640" style="s2">to avoid their solitude but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.110" end="00:30:09.330" style="s2">sense in which playful though that might</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.640" end="00:30:11.220" style="s2">be it&#39;s actually not helpful I think in</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.330" end="00:30:12.420" style="s2">the long run at least some iterations of</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.220" end="00:30:15.000" style="s2">it aren&#39;t helpful because what this</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.420" end="00:30:16.530" style="s2">affords us is a tutorial for how to</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.000" end="00:30:18.300" style="s2">treat ourselves in solitude and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.530" end="00:30:20.340" style="s2">campfire does that beautifully because</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.300" end="00:30:22.080" style="s2">the campfire mediates Communion and</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.340" end="00:30:26.460" style="s2">solitude and I think it does that by</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.080" end="00:30:28.200" style="s2">collapsing narrativity and and what we</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.460" end="00:30:28.620" style="s2">might call reasoning together that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.200" end="00:30:31.200" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.620" end="00:30:32.700" style="s2">right so there&#39;s something about the</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.200" end="00:30:35.850" style="s2">telling of stories around the campfire</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.700" end="00:30:37.620" style="s2">and the disclosure the intimate and</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.850" end="00:30:40.410" style="s2">personal disclosures that take place</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.620" end="00:30:42.330" style="s2">around the campfire that help to cull</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.410" end="00:30:44.100" style="s2">laughs the solitude into the world of</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.330" end="00:30:47.460" style="s2">the social and then collapsed the social</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.100" end="00:30:50.040" style="s2">and solitude so there&#39;s a nexus point of</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.460" end="00:30:52.100" style="s2">this virtual campfire India logo that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.040" end="00:30:55.470" style="s2">why I think it&#39;s such a beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.100" end="00:30:56.970" style="s2">animating metaphor a mesmeric metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.470" end="00:30:58.950" style="s2">right we stare into a fire we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.970" end="00:31:01.140" style="s2">mesmerised by it right it&#39;s hard to tear</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.950" end="00:31:02.850" style="s2">your gaze away from it because it seems</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.140" end="00:31:04.650" style="s2">to it&#39;s no wonder Heraclitus was too</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.850" end="00:31:08.280" style="s2">obsessed with it it seems to disclose</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.650" end="00:31:09.990" style="s2">reality as you gaze into it just as</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.280" end="00:31:11.400" style="s2">dialogo seems to do right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.990" end="00:31:12.960" style="s2">equidistant between you you&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.400" end="00:31:15.030" style="s2">gazing into it and you&#39;re all gazing</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.960" end="00:31:17.310" style="s2">through it at one another at the same</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.030" end="00:31:20.070" style="s2">time so I just find it to be like a</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.310" end="00:31:23.700" style="s2">really rapturous symbol and when we</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.070" end="00:31:26.160" style="s2">understand it as an enactment of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.700" end="00:31:30.210" style="s2">dialogic process I think we&#39;ll find</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.160" end="00:31:32.190" style="s2">within it if we can adapt that if we can</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.210" end="00:31:35.010" style="s2">adapt that symbol and place it at the</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.190" end="00:31:38.460" style="s2">center of a dialogic praxis it will help</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.010" end="00:31:39.960" style="s2">us to understand why dia logos in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.460" end="00:31:42.690" style="s2">way that we&#39;ve been discussing it is</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.960" end="00:31:44.760" style="s2">such a perfect way of mediating our</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.690" end="00:31:47.010" style="s2">relationship between the interior life</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.760" end="00:31:49.350" style="s2">that has gone so uncultivated all this</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.010" end="00:31:55.310" style="s2">time and the outer life that we are so</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.350" end="00:31:58.710" style="s2">hopelessly beholden to show that over</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.310" end="00:32:01.710" style="s2">there was a gap it&#39;s okay that&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.710" end="00:32:03.900" style="s2">do because in the Plato in the seventh</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.710" end="00:32:06.720" style="s2">letter uses the metaphor of the fire for</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.900" end="00:32:09.510" style="s2">exactly talking about this kind of via</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.720" end="00:32:11.610" style="s2">logos he says you can&#39;t get it just by</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.510" end="00:32:13.470" style="s2">talking you have to dwell with people</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.610" end="00:32:16.980" style="s2">you have to live with them the longtime</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.470" end="00:32:19.020" style="s2">spark catches and then it takes on and</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.980" end="00:32:22.500" style="s2">he talks about how the fire takes on a</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.020" end="00:32:27.210" style="s2">life of its own and so I think the fire</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.500" end="00:32:29.460" style="s2">is used by Plato like picking up on the</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.210" end="00:32:32.550" style="s2">heretical idea and fragment about the</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.460" end="00:32:34.560" style="s2">universe is a self kindling fire the</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.550" end="00:32:36.090" style="s2">idea that the D logos you know is very</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.560" end="00:32:37.710" style="s2">much like a fire and that it takes on a</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.090" end="00:32:39.690" style="s2">life of we put the conditions together</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.710" end="00:32:41.100" style="s2">then it takes on a life of the cause and</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.690" end="00:32:43.320" style="s2">then it has this function that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.100" end="00:32:47.790" style="s2">talking about very much as function</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.320" end="00:32:48.920" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about so I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.790" end="00:32:51.660" style="s2">I&#39;m try to</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.920" end="00:32:54.900" style="s2">see what the if we can make a connection</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.660" end="00:32:56.790" style="s2">between what you were saying just now</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.900" end="00:32:59.670" style="s2">and then and and the point I was trying</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.790" end="00:33:03.120" style="s2">to make we&#39;re right that dialogo sees</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.670" end="00:33:04.230" style="s2">very much and the reason I&#39;m doing that</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.120" end="00:33:06.690" style="s2">is because Plato brings them together</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.230" end="00:33:08.190" style="s2">right it&#39;s not just a conversation it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.690" end="00:33:10.200" style="s2">not just you have to live with people</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.190" end="00:33:12.840" style="s2">you have to sort of enculturate a way of</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.200" end="00:33:15.180" style="s2">life all right that that&#39;s it that</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.840" end="00:33:17.430" style="s2">that&#39;s part of what makes the deilogos</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.180" end="00:33:20.670" style="s2">actually possible the part of the fuel</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.430" end="00:33:22.110" style="s2">if you want a video logos is not just</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.670" end="00:33:24.330" style="s2">the conversation about how people are</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.110" end="00:33:26.910" style="s2">bringing ways of life together and</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.330" end="00:33:28.230" style="s2">wondering how that comports with what</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.910" end="00:33:30.740" style="s2">you were saying about the bridge would</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.230" end="00:33:33.120" style="s2">mean the individual and the collective</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.740" end="00:33:35.760" style="s2">well I think if we were to afford to</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.120" end="00:33:38.070" style="s2">carry the metaphor through of the fire</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.760" end="00:33:39.420" style="s2">it does that quite naturally right the</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.070" end="00:33:41.430" style="s2">whole point of the campfire is that</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.420" end="00:33:43.710" style="s2">people flock to it precisely because it</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.430" end="00:33:45.720" style="s2">becomes a refuge for these sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.710" end="00:33:46.950" style="s2">darkness that&#39;s intrinsic to the world</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.720" end="00:33:48.930" style="s2">in which people are living at that</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.950" end="00:33:50.280" style="s2">particular moment I think the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.930" end="00:33:54.720" style="s2">right now that we&#39;re seeing is that as</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.280" end="00:33:56.990" style="s2">the as the the well as this reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.720" end="00:34:00.270" style="s2">narrowing becomes more and more</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.990" end="00:34:03.420" style="s2">constrictive and as we retreat more and</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.270" end="00:34:04.740" style="s2">more and more into our inner lives we</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.420" end="00:34:06.870" style="s2">find that were the source of our own</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.740" end="00:34:08.190" style="s2">scarcity right like as we retreat into</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.870" end="00:34:09.960" style="s2">the darkness we don&#39;t find the darkness</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.190" end="00:34:12.720" style="s2">yields anything it&#39;s not we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.960" end="00:34:15.360" style="s2">penetrated by it except in ways that</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.720" end="00:34:16.800" style="s2">seem pernicious and so in a way where I</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.360" end="00:34:19.140" style="s2">think a lot of people are gonna find</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.800" end="00:34:22.830" style="s2">that there is no choice but to seek some</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.140" end="00:34:27.990" style="s2">kind of some kind of communal antidote</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.830" end="00:34:29.940" style="s2">to that feeling of of just that feeling</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.990" end="00:34:32.100" style="s2">of destitution that happens when you</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.940" end="00:34:34.380" style="s2">basically have only your subjectivity</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.100" end="00:34:36.780" style="s2">like yours cetera and you have wind only</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.380" end="00:34:38.730" style="s2">your subjective being left to lean back</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.780" end="00:34:42.330" style="s2">on and it reveals itself to be like</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.730" end="00:34:46.260" style="s2">vapid then you have to somehow find a</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.330" end="00:34:51.980" style="s2">way of sharing it in such a way that it</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.260" end="00:34:56.040" style="s2">that it&#39;s that is that it&#39;s reimbursing</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.980" end="00:34:57.780" style="s2">something alive and so I think so I</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.040" end="00:35:01.980" style="s2">guess what I&#39;m trying to say is this I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.780" end="00:35:02.640" style="s2">I&#39;m as we&#39;re treating further I I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.980" end="00:35:05.760" style="s2">thinking about</p>

<p begin="00:42:06.380" end="00:42:09.560" style="s2">the feminine into this conversation well</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.030" end="00:42:11.330" style="s2">know what we&#39;re talking about right</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.560" end="00:42:13.310" style="s2">right right if you want to actually have</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.330" end="00:42:15.860" style="s2">this thing happen that&#39;s the way to do</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.310" end="00:42:16.910" style="s2">it mm-hmm everyone fills in themselves</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.860" end="00:42:19.580" style="s2">the attraction to that which is most</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.910" end="00:42:21.440" style="s2">needful if you can allow that to seduce</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.580" end="00:42:23.930" style="s2">us into right action then we&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.440" end="00:42:29.090" style="s2">very happily that becomes the joyful</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.930" end="00:42:34.010" style="s2">interaction that&#39;s really cool so is</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.090" end="00:42:37.340" style="s2">that back to you know the finesse that</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.010" end="00:42:39.920" style="s2">between vulnerability and exposure that</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.340" end="00:42:42.050" style="s2">guy talks about you know because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.920" end="00:42:45.950" style="s2">thinking you know Jordan we you and I</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.050" end="00:42:48.910" style="s2">talked about sort of maybe you all say</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.950" end="00:42:51.350" style="s2">an anti aesthetic and we people try to</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.910" end="00:42:53.090" style="s2">catharsis they try to transform the</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.350" end="00:42:54.950" style="s2">anxiety into fear which gives them a</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.090" end="00:42:56.990" style="s2">clear distinct object and they can</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.950" end="00:42:59.990" style="s2">discharge it but that actually isn&#39;t to</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.990" end="00:43:02.690" style="s2">respond to their fear whereas right it</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.990" end="00:43:06.740" style="s2">might be instead right there&#39;s a way of</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.690" end="00:43:09.110" style="s2">responding to the noise of anxiety in</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.740" end="00:43:11.060" style="s2">the way you&#39;re talking about here mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.110" end="00:43:14.030" style="s2">is that does that land at all whatever</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.060" end="00:43:16.400" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to get out yeah I think there</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.030" end="00:43:17.960" style="s2">is something there it&#39;s something this</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.400" end="00:43:21.790" style="s2">is worth let&#39;s just said after the</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.960" end="00:43:21.790" style="s2">contemplating it for a while sure</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.000" end="00:43:35.440" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.400" end="00:43:38.950" style="s2">I imagine we&#39;ve all been seduced I would</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.440" end="00:43:40.570" style="s2">hope so if not I recommend it and</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.950" end="00:43:42.010" style="s2">there&#39;s something in that that is</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.570" end="00:43:43.990" style="s2">exactly what you were speaking about</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.010" end="00:43:47.130" style="s2">when you talked about the I think was</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.990" end="00:43:49.930" style="s2">the vulnerability and exposure and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.130" end="00:43:52.210" style="s2">yeah I was thinking that maybe there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.930" end="00:43:55.150" style="s2">parallel right between you know anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.210" end="00:43:57.820" style="s2">you know but if you can sort of transfer</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.150" end="00:43:59.890" style="s2">so a positive transformation might be to</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.820" end="00:44:02.050" style="s2">transform this is very pertinent to me</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.890" end="00:44:04.420" style="s2">personally to transform exposure into</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.050" end="00:44:07.510" style="s2">vulnerability where vulnerability is a</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.420" end="00:44:12.040" style="s2">kind of probative sensitivity as opposed</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.510" end="00:44:18.150" style="s2">to a sense of being harmed or cut off in</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.040" end="00:44:20.860" style="s2">some fashion mm-hmm I would say that</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.150" end="00:44:24.250" style="s2">more than any of the reasons that I</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.860" end="00:44:28.270" style="s2">actually stated the reason why I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.250" end="00:44:33.360" style="s2">to get together is because what happens</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.270" end="00:44:35.620" style="s2">here is beautiful it is in an</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.360" end="00:44:37.860" style="s2">aspirational way in a way that actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.620" end="00:44:40.750" style="s2">and it actually in a way that I</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.860" end="00:44:44.320" style="s2">anticipate being so in a way that I know</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.750" end="00:44:47.380" style="s2">without knowing it there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.320" end="00:44:49.900" style="s2">way where I think that there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.380" end="00:44:53.040" style="s2">that quality of beauty that that</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.900" end="00:44:56.590" style="s2">inherently involves concealment and</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.040" end="00:45:00.040" style="s2">withdrawal and coming into concealment</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.590" end="00:45:02.230" style="s2">that and there&#39;s a there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.040" end="00:45:04.570" style="s2">about at least for me these</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.230" end="00:45:07.030" style="s2">conversations and reading philosophy and</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.570" end="00:45:09.070" style="s2">doing circling and and all of the the</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.030" end="00:45:11.350" style="s2">mystical traditions and everything I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.070" end="00:45:14.050" style="s2">ever even done any remotely like this</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.350" end="00:45:17.650" style="s2">that that I think the the thread through</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.050" end="00:45:20.830" style="s2">all of it has to do with awakening the</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.650" end="00:45:22.990" style="s2">sense that there is more than meets the</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.830" end="00:45:26.410" style="s2">eye there&#39;s more than that&#39;s being heard</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.990" end="00:45:32.680" style="s2">but I can begin to orient my attention</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.410" end="00:45:36.460" style="s2">to that which is isn&#39;t here but could be</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.680" end="00:45:38.020" style="s2">here or reach into that sense of as you</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.460" end="00:45:40.470" style="s2">often talk</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.020" end="00:45:43.510" style="s2">John is that sense of more nests like</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.470" end="00:45:46.210" style="s2">The Fountainhead of intelligibility and</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.510" end="00:45:48.760" style="s2">there is and I really like this notion</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.210" end="00:45:51.220" style="s2">of seduction right in the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.760" end="00:45:56.460" style="s2">because there is a quality of it really</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.220" end="00:45:58.720" style="s2">does strike me as you know when my wife</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.460" end="00:46:00.010" style="s2">does something beautiful if she just</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.720" end="00:46:03.060" style="s2">looks at me a particular way there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.010" end="00:46:09.340" style="s2">this Shh there&#39;s a way where you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.060" end="00:46:10.090" style="s2">you you can&#39;t capture huh you can&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.340" end="00:46:13.240" style="s2">that happen</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.090" end="00:46:16.020" style="s2">you&#39;re in relationship to it you can you</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.240" end="00:46:20.500" style="s2">can dance around it you can be present</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.020" end="00:46:23.820" style="s2">but when she opens when she opens right</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.500" end="00:46:28.600" style="s2">and there&#39;s always a sense of of being</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.820" end="00:46:34.420" style="s2">when she does a deep gratitude in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.600" end="00:46:37.720" style="s2">sense of being subordinate to her so the</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.420" end="00:46:40.000" style="s2">the I really like this quality I do</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.720" end="00:46:43.420" style="s2">think that the the draw the attractor</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.000" end="00:46:47.290" style="s2">right the attractor is is the beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.420" end="00:46:49.780" style="s2">and I do do you notice that like in my</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.290" end="00:46:51.780" style="s2">experience with circling you know which</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.780" end="00:46:54.160" style="s2">is a lot has a lot to do with people</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.780" end="00:46:57.760" style="s2">experiencing other people and themselves</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.160" end="00:47:00.570" style="s2">being vulnerable and there&#39;s a volunteer</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.760" end="00:47:02.890" style="s2">like the difference between exposure and</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.570" end="00:47:06.940" style="s2">invulnerability has to do with violent</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.890" end="00:47:08.500" style="s2">being a volunteer right so it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.940" end="00:47:10.990" style="s2">know it&#39;s the difference between I&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.500" end="00:47:13.210" style="s2">the playground and somebody comes up</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.990" end="00:47:16.420" style="s2">behind being pushes my you know pulls my</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.210" end="00:47:19.240" style="s2">pants down I didn&#39;t sign up for that but</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.420" end="00:47:22.030" style="s2">all of a sudden like my my most</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.240" end="00:47:23.500" style="s2">vulnerable parts of me are exposed to</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.030" end="00:47:25.720" style="s2">the world in a way that I wouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.500" end="00:47:28.869" style="s2">volunteered for right there&#39;s that sense</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.720" end="00:47:30.609" style="s2">of exposure where vulnerability is more</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.869" end="00:47:34.240" style="s2">of that sense where I&#39;m actually at</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.609" end="00:47:37.600" style="s2">something scary yet something I see</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.240" end="00:47:43.140" style="s2">something valuable enough glows bigger</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.600" end="00:47:48.820" style="s2">than that fear and such I really this</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.140" end="00:47:51.790" style="s2">disclose myself to it and I noticed that</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.820" end="00:47:56.260" style="s2">when people witness other people do</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.790" end="00:47:58.840" style="s2">do that it is almost impossible not to</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.260" end="00:48:00.790" style="s2">fall in love with that person it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.840" end="00:48:03.190" style="s2">almost impossible not to be moved</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.790" end="00:48:07.110" style="s2">they&#39;re just that experience of watching</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.190" end="00:48:11.370" style="s2">somebody stretch and reach and fumble</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.110" end="00:48:14.290" style="s2">voluntarily being awkward in the face of</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.370" end="00:48:17.200" style="s2">something they could be so painful if it</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.290" end="00:48:20.410" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work out right and to do that</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.200" end="00:48:25.150" style="s2">voluntarily is it is a revelation of I</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.410" end="00:48:26.950" style="s2">think what is most beautiful in us but I</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.150" end="00:48:29.820" style="s2">want to pick up on that though because</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.950" end="00:48:34.270" style="s2">in and the two things you talked about</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.820" end="00:48:35.710" style="s2">because there&#39;s I don&#39;t think this</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.270" end="00:48:39.280" style="s2">contradicts you guy but I want to put it</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.710" end="00:48:41.350" style="s2">in sort of like into dialogue because</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.280" end="00:48:41.950" style="s2">what strikes me about beauty is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.350" end="00:48:45.280" style="s2">what I just said</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.950" end="00:48:48.070" style="s2">Judy strikes us we&#39;re struck by it right</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.280" end="00:48:52.920" style="s2">and there&#39;s something it&#39;s almost like</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.070" end="00:48:56.320" style="s2">beauty is retros it&#39;s it&#39;s retrospective</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.920" end="00:48:57.670" style="s2">voluntary like I&#39;m carried into it and</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.320" end="00:49:00.730" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like you said before and I</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.670" end="00:49:03.610" style="s2">find myself already in it and it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.730" end="00:49:06.670" style="s2">retrospectively say ah I&#39;ve been carried</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.610" end="00:49:09.310" style="s2">here sort of against my will if you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.670" end="00:49:13.450" style="s2">allow me that but I assent to it</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.310" end="00:49:16.780" style="s2">completely right you know so I&#39;m given a</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.450" end="00:49:19.390" style="s2">moment of choice in beauty where I find</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.780" end="00:49:22.630" style="s2">it being carried along by some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.390" end="00:49:25.170" style="s2">logos huh and and that&#39;s a moment of</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.630" end="00:49:28.360" style="s2">faith that&#39;s a moment of no no no I</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.170" end="00:49:31.800" style="s2">accept I&#39;m being carried up by this and</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.360" end="00:49:34.390" style="s2">I accepted and it&#39;s precisely because</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.800" end="00:49:35.830" style="s2">you know because it&#39;s beautiful that</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.390" end="00:49:39.070" style="s2">seems to me to be part of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.830" end="00:49:42.160" style="s2">phenomenology of beauty and and scary in</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.070" end="00:49:45.900" style="s2">her book beauty and justice she says</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.160" end="00:49:48.700" style="s2">that that capacity for beauty she says</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.900" end="00:49:49.780" style="s2">it that she&#39;s trying to do a thing with</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.700" end="00:49:51.490" style="s2">the true the good in a beautiful she</p>

<p begin="00:49:53.560" end="00:49:57.220" style="s2">this is the aspirational part right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.690" end="00:49:59.680" style="s2">where we get our primary training for</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.220" end="00:50:01.570" style="s2">truth and justice because unless we can</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.680" end="00:50:02.480" style="s2">be struck by something outside our ego</p>

<p begin="00:50:08.990" end="00:50:13.160" style="s2">we need that primary ability - this took</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.320" end="00:50:19.010" style="s2">me by surprise</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.160" end="00:50:20.840" style="s2">and yet I accept it I feel there&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:50:29.690" end="00:50:35.540" style="s2">about and she talked about how that also</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.400" end="00:50:38.660" style="s2">prepares us for justice because what it</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.540" end="00:50:40.640" style="s2">does for us is it makes us realize that</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.660" end="00:50:43.430" style="s2">certain things are deserving of our</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.640" end="00:50:45.470" style="s2">attention in the way that virtus talks</p>

<p begin="00:50:45.470" end="00:50:50.540" style="s2">of the subjectivity of attention right</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.170" end="00:50:52.850" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s an inversion that these thing</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.540" end="00:50:54.500" style="s2">the project is to make myself relative</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.850" end="00:50:57.140" style="s2">these things things are deserving of my</p>

<p begin="00:51:04.430" end="00:51:10.460" style="s2">that involvement like it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:51:21.920" end="00:51:26.120" style="s2">what I mean about how there&#39;s a deep</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.090" end="00:51:27.380" style="s2">connection and you know and of course</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.120" end="00:51:30.140" style="s2">was obviously alluding to it</p>

<p begin="00:51:32.150" end="00:51:36.380" style="s2">it&#39;s rife through the Platonic dialogues</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.890" end="00:51:39.770" style="s2">us right especially in the encounter</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.380" end="00:51:42.550" style="s2">with also by these for example and so</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.770" end="00:51:45.140" style="s2">this what I mean about the way</p>

<p begin="00:51:50.450" end="00:51:57.310" style="s2">truth new truth and new justice right in</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.620" end="00:51:57.310" style="s2">powerful ways</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.390" end="00:52:06.489" style="s2">hmm yeah I was</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.559" end="00:52:08.959" style="s2">a movement in that direction between the</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.489" end="00:52:10.309" style="s2">between the salient and irrelevant in</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.959" end="00:52:11.869" style="s2">that context right</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.309" end="00:52:14.569" style="s2">I was actually been thinking</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.869" end="00:52:16.789" style="s2">contemplating the evolutionary story</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.569" end="00:52:17.930" style="s2">what the evolutionary theory behind the</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.789" end="00:52:20.749" style="s2">nature of what we consider to be</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.930" end="00:52:22.519" style="s2">beautiful yes over a very long period of</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.749" end="00:52:23.059" style="s2">time and that which was a likely good</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.519" end="00:52:24.499" style="s2">choice</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.059" end="00:52:27.380" style="s2">is what we have come to do receive as</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.499" end="00:52:28.430" style="s2">beautiful right in all ways and</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.380" end="00:52:31.249" style="s2">everything everything that we can ever</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.430" end="00:52:34.339" style="s2">of our entire relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.249" end="00:52:35.959" style="s2">project for 13 million years has been</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.339" end="00:52:37.609" style="s2">honed against the capacity to actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.959" end="00:52:39.109" style="s2">make effective choices in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.609" end="00:52:44.539" style="s2">that which is perceived as most</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.109" end="00:52:46.989" style="s2">beautiful part of what via logos does</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.539" end="00:52:49.939" style="s2">Plato considers this in the symposium</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.989" end="00:52:52.099" style="s2">right here&#39;s what it does is it takes us</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.939" end="00:52:54.979" style="s2">through sort of stages of aspirational</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.099" end="00:52:58.609" style="s2">exaptation we take sort of a basic you</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.979" end="00:53:01.819" style="s2">know sexual ability and then we exact it</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.609" end="00:53:03.859" style="s2">into epistemic and then we exact it into</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.819" end="00:53:06.759" style="s2">existential and perhaps we then exact it</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.859" end="00:53:09.619" style="s2">into something profoundly ontological</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.759" end="00:53:11.299" style="s2">because Plato talks about that capacity</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.619" end="00:53:13.459" style="s2">ah right</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.299" end="00:53:16.609" style="s2">think about how its it&#39;s intrinsically</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.459" end="00:53:18.319" style="s2">holistic it&#39;s an integrative sense it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.609" end="00:53:20.479" style="s2">an integrative sense of discernment that</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.319" end="00:53:22.009" style="s2">you actually cannot help but huh if you</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.479" end="00:53:24.229" style="s2">don&#39;t have the whole like you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.009" end="00:53:27.109" style="s2">playing music yeah use that metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.229" end="00:53:29.269" style="s2">playing guitar and you&#39;re not playing a</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.109" end="00:53:30.890" style="s2">script you&#39;re not playing a song you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.269" end="00:53:32.660" style="s2">playing something this is a feeling</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.890" end="00:53:33.920" style="s2">right if you are fully in it right</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.660" end="00:53:35.660" style="s2">you&#39;re allowing the whole of yourself to</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.920" end="00:53:37.819" style="s2">just melt into the sensing that uh but</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.660" end="00:53:39.170" style="s2">and all you do is feel that aspect that</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.819" end="00:53:40.640" style="s2">which is yearning to be the most</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.170" end="00:53:44.199" style="s2">beautiful move that can be made right</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.640" end="00:53:46.039" style="s2">now you are making beautiful music and</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.199" end="00:53:48.109" style="s2">exactly to the degree to which you have</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.039" end="00:53:51.079" style="s2">either either back away from an aspect</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.109" end="00:53:52.939" style="s2">of yourself or you&#39;ve reached the limits</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.079" end="00:53:54.319" style="s2">of the capacity to be wholly in</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.939" end="00:53:56.269" style="s2">relationship with the possibilities that</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.319" end="00:53:58.549" style="s2">are emerging moment to moment is in fact</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.269" end="00:54:01.849" style="s2">the end in the limit of your capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.549" end="00:54:03.289" style="s2">become to make beautiful this is a Pope</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.849" end="00:54:04.759" style="s2">this is the appropriate modality for</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.289" end="00:54:06.920" style="s2">considering questions of the sort that</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.759" end="00:54:10.099" style="s2">we&#39;re considering yes you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.920" end="00:54:11.929" style="s2">coming from an integrative wholeness and</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.099" end="00:54:13.249" style="s2">be feeling into the right way of making</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.929" end="00:54:14.959" style="s2">steps in a place where they we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.249" end="00:54:17.029" style="s2">analytically break this thing down it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.959" end="00:54:18.799" style="s2">hopelessly complex</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.029" end="00:54:21.289" style="s2">every move implicates everything else in</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.799" end="00:54:23.089" style="s2">ways we can&#39;t possibly understand this</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.289" end="00:54:24.679" style="s2">is the inactive integrity you often</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.089" end="00:54:26.269" style="s2">point towards in these discussions of</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.679" end="00:54:32.299" style="s2">faith am I correct</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.269" end="00:54:33.859" style="s2">yes absolutely go ahead this is dead</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.299" end="00:54:35.569" style="s2">this is also the difference between the</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.859" end="00:54:36.559" style="s2">two versions of the philosopher that you</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.569" end="00:54:37.969" style="s2">were talking about at the very beginning</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.559" end="00:54:41.809" style="s2">Jordan mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.969" end="00:54:44.689" style="s2">one who is circumscribed by constraints</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.809" end="00:54:49.219" style="s2">that usually eliminate and exclude the</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.689" end="00:54:50.929" style="s2">artistic that that that that that sort</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.219" end="00:54:54.650" style="s2">of guilds philosophy with the aesthetic</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.929" end="00:54:56.809" style="s2">attractiveness that ultimately begins</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.650" end="00:54:58.519" style="s2">the process of that seduction right</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.809" end="00:55:00.049" style="s2">because right now I think it&#39;s almost as</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.519" end="00:55:02.509" style="s2">other probably like the artistic project</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.049" end="00:55:04.489" style="s2">and the philosophic project need to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.509" end="00:55:07.219" style="s2">revalorisé to one another to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.489" end="00:55:12.049" style="s2">reintegrated after so many years being</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.219" end="00:55:15.949" style="s2">at quits and I think if it&#39;s it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.049" end="00:55:21.380" style="s2">that that that that marriage is so so</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.949" end="00:55:22.579" style="s2">essential to to to being able to for the</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.380" end="00:55:24.229" style="s2">whole ism that you&#39;re talking about I</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.579" end="00:55:26.989" style="s2">think that marriage is so essential and</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.229" end="00:55:31.609" style="s2">one of the things that we struggle right</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.989" end="00:55:33.229" style="s2">now to to to resolve Wow yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.609" end="00:55:35.059" style="s2">about this I mean we had these cycles</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.229" end="00:55:36.859" style="s2">between the the shaman and the chief</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.059" end="00:55:39.890" style="s2">between the philosopher poet and the</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.859" end="00:55:41.419" style="s2">king we have the that individual who</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.890" end="00:55:42.859" style="s2">plays the role of a suppose the scholar</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.419" end="00:55:44.449" style="s2">who acts as the weapon that the King</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.859" end="00:55:46.459" style="s2">uses to hold back the power the</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.449" end="00:55:47.809" style="s2">philosopher poet and in some cases this</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.459" end="00:55:48.919" style="s2">is most meaningful because for God&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.809" end="00:55:51.140" style="s2">sakes the Worcester poet is very</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.919" end="00:55:53.029" style="s2">dangerous to the status quo the creative</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.140" end="00:55:54.559" style="s2">impulse is disruptive but there are</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.029" end="00:55:55.909" style="s2">moments would come like the moment that</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.559" end="00:55:58.299" style="s2">we&#39;re in when quite obviously the king</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.909" end="00:56:00.619" style="s2">has become the old king building the</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.299" end="00:56:02.630" style="s2">Babylonian myths right now oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.619" end="00:56:04.819" style="s2">you&#39;re enacting where the time has come</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.630" end="00:56:06.919" style="s2">for that transition to actually become</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.819" end="00:56:08.569" style="s2">fully bursting forth and now the calling</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.919" end="00:56:09.979" style="s2">is to actually recognize the the</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.569" end="00:56:12.199" style="s2">philosopher poet and with full creative</p>

<p begin="00:56:40.070" end="00:56:46.310" style="s2">is that via logos the dialogic form</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.540" end="00:56:51.410" style="s2">exemplifies exactly that kind of</p>

<p begin="00:56:51.410" end="00:56:56.180" style="s2">think particularly I think I was talking</p>

<p begin="00:57:37.310" end="00:57:40.790" style="s2">not it&#39;s not is not easy right and one</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.650" end="00:57:45.080" style="s2">of the things that we&#39;re contending with</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.790" end="00:57:47.270" style="s2">and and and trying to resist is the are</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.080" end="00:57:48.470" style="s2">the multiple sets of constraints that I</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.270" end="00:57:50.600" style="s2">mean as you were you were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.470" end="00:57:52.400" style="s2">our particular state of actuality that</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.600" end="00:57:55.490" style="s2">ultimately needs to be subject to a kind</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.400" end="00:57:58.630" style="s2">of artistic disillusion in order to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.490" end="00:58:01.130" style="s2">reborn into something of possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.630" end="00:58:04.250" style="s2">a possibility that that becomes</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.130" end="00:58:07.040" style="s2">navigable and that&#39;s a hard thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.250" end="00:58:09.650" style="s2">when the very structures that are meant</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.040" end="00:58:12.530" style="s2">to foster and equilibrate us are also</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.650" end="00:58:14.660" style="s2">the things that that circumscribe that</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.530" end="00:58:18.350" style="s2">same kind of creativity that prevent</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.660" end="00:58:19.880" style="s2">that same synthesis and and I think</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.350" end="00:58:22.070" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s why it&#39;s so easy to</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.880" end="00:58:24.170" style="s2">be at a loss that&#39;s why it&#39;s so easy to</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.070" end="00:58:26.270" style="s2">be at a loss is because that has to be</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.170" end="00:58:27.890" style="s2">it has to be nurtured from without it</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.270" end="00:58:29.480" style="s2">can be kindled from within but it has to</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.890" end="00:58:31.850" style="s2">be nurtured from without and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.480" end="00:58:35.630" style="s2">again to your point you got about the</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.850" end="00:58:37.160" style="s2">importance of like the the logic process</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.630" end="00:58:39.350" style="s2">is so important precisely because it</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.160" end="00:58:41.660" style="s2">requires that it requires the tutoring</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.350" end="00:58:43.280" style="s2">mm-hmm there&#39;s the loving from without</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.660" end="00:58:44.760" style="s2">and the tutoring from without it</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.280" end="00:58:49.590" style="s2">requires us</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.760" end="00:58:52.590" style="s2">if we must first be seen in potentia in</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.590" end="00:58:55.320" style="s2">order to actually then reach out into</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.590" end="00:58:57.540" style="s2">the actual and those two things have to</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.320" end="00:58:59.160" style="s2">have to wed properly and it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.540" end="00:59:03.030" style="s2">difficult for that to happen if it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.160" end="00:59:05.460" style="s2">called out from from something or</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.030" end="00:59:06.990" style="s2">someone beautiful right because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.460" end="00:59:08.610" style="s2">it&#39;s not a charge it&#39;s not just that</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.990" end="00:59:10.770" style="s2">it&#39;s not just that we have to behold</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.610" end="00:59:12.600" style="s2">beauty it&#39;s that the beat we have to be</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.770" end="00:59:14.820" style="s2">beholden by the beauty we have to be</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.600" end="00:59:16.590" style="s2">called out by the beauty right well I I</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.820" end="00:59:19.050" style="s2">liken it to that feeling of you know I</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.590" end="00:59:21.180" style="s2">like to you know yeah you&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.050" end="00:59:22.350" style="s2">some someone attractive from afar and</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.180" end="00:59:23.400" style="s2">then they look at you and it&#39;s like whoa</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.350" end="00:59:24.960" style="s2">look at that</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.400" end="00:59:26.240" style="s2">alright you write it because and all of</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.960" end="00:59:29.550" style="s2">a sudden you&#39;re outside of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.240" end="00:59:31.500" style="s2">immediately it&#39;s just like that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.550" end="00:59:34.100" style="s2">struck but it&#39;s not but right but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.500" end="00:59:37.050" style="s2">but but it&#39;s being struck by Beauty</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.100" end="00:59:39.090" style="s2">requires activity if I can put it that</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.050" end="00:59:41.250" style="s2">way on the part of the beauty right yes</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.090" end="00:59:43.730" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s an agency of the beauty</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.250" end="00:59:46.020" style="s2">it&#39;s not passive it&#39;s not like a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.730" end="00:59:47.790" style="s2">Aristotelian passivity we sort of move</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.020" end="00:59:50.370" style="s2">around it but it doesn&#39;t move right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.790" end="00:59:53.490" style="s2">no no no no it&#39;s it reaches to us as we</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.370" end="00:59:54.960" style="s2">reach out to it um and then I love that</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.490" end="00:59:56.700" style="s2">you&#39;re sort of your and that and I love</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.960" end="00:59:58.650" style="s2">the way that you articulated that trend</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.700" end="01:00:00.630" style="s2">that we&#39;re sort of born by the logos and</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.650" end="01:00:04.590" style="s2">then in process of being born by the</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.630" end="01:00:06.810" style="s2">logos we make we sort of we we make we</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.590" end="01:00:08.850" style="s2">can&#39;t we consummate the journey with the</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.810" end="01:00:12.840" style="s2">choice to undertake the journey even as</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.850" end="01:00:14.820" style="s2">it&#39;s already undertaken right and but</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.840" end="01:00:16.380" style="s2">but but I think that but they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.820" end="01:00:18.240" style="s2">in see therein lies the challenge though</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.380" end="01:00:20.010" style="s2">therein lies the challenge because if we</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.240" end="01:00:21.240" style="s2">can&#39;t that goes back to the fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.010" end="01:00:23.520" style="s2">problem we started with with the</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.240" end="01:00:25.350" style="s2">subjectivity the barrenness of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.520" end="01:00:27.240" style="s2">subjectivity that can&#39;t reach into</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.350" end="01:00:31.800" style="s2">itself and also can&#39;t reach out of</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.240" end="01:00:34.730" style="s2">itself is that it needs to be lifted at</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.800" end="01:00:37.530" style="s2">least it needs to be lifted from without</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.730" end="01:00:39.960" style="s2">and I think I&#39;m hearing us start to</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.530" end="01:00:43.080" style="s2">start to get at I think I&#39;m hearing or</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.960" end="01:00:46.200" style="s2">what we&#39;re saying is distinguishing a</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.080" end="01:00:50.280" style="s2">and intent isn&#39;t it in integrity within</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.200" end="01:00:51.570" style="s2">or a beauty yes and the structures that</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.280" end="01:00:56.940" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about that there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.570" end="01:00:58.900" style="s2">integrity so I think it hurt someone</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.940" end="01:01:02.200" style="s2">said that all possibility</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.900" end="01:01:03.970" style="s2">right sits on top of integrity if</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.200" end="01:01:05.860" style="s2">there&#39;s no integrity</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.970" end="01:01:09.640" style="s2">there goes possibility they&#39;re very very</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.860" end="01:01:13.830" style="s2">wedded and so what I&#39;m hearing are the</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.640" end="01:01:16.990" style="s2">conditions of possibility of beauty and</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.830" end="01:01:20.080" style="s2">that&#39;s just where my notice my listening</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.990" end="01:01:21.700" style="s2">is sinking into here yeah because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.080" end="01:01:23.440" style="s2">because it&#39;s a beauty that record yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.700" end="01:01:25.240" style="s2">yeah yeah that&#39;s right guy cuz it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.440" end="01:01:29.380" style="s2">beauty that it&#39;s a beauty that</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.240" end="01:01:30.790" style="s2">recognizes beauty beauty it&#39;s a beauty</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.380" end="01:01:31.990" style="s2">cognizant of beauty yeah while I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.790" end="01:01:33.370" style="s2">thinking about it because we just read</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.990" end="01:01:34.390" style="s2">it the other day I&#39;m thinking I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.370" end="01:01:38.140" style="s2">thinking about the beginning of Yale</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.390" end="01:01:40.570" style="s2">societies were you know Socrates butters</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.140" end="01:01:42.070" style="s2">Alcibiades with flattery for a few</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.570" end="01:01:43.750" style="s2">minutes I mean not only a Socrates</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.070" end="01:01:45.730" style="s2">attractive unto himself right because</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.750" end="01:01:48.190" style="s2">he&#39;s Socrates but he butters Alcibiades</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.730" end="01:01:49.960" style="s2">and beautifies him before his own eyes</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.190" end="01:01:53.230" style="s2">and there&#39;s something about the way he</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.960" end="01:01:55.120" style="s2">beautifies him before his own eyes that</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.230" end="01:01:57.940" style="s2">actually attracts him and entreat them</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.120" end="01:02:00.340" style="s2">into the dialogic process mmm</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.940" end="01:02:01.750" style="s2">places for a careful game right he flack</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.340" end="01:02:03.280" style="s2">you sort of he does that thing he does</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.750" end="01:02:05.020" style="s2">he sort of flatters him and insults him</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.280" end="01:02:08.710" style="s2">at the same time cool right</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.020" end="01:02:12.550" style="s2">he sort of he he strokes his potential</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.710" end="01:02:15.310" style="s2">but reveals his lack simultaneously and</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.550" end="01:02:17.410" style="s2">it was that combination I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.310" end="01:02:19.060" style="s2">like the ATS the alchemical combination</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.410" end="01:02:20.770" style="s2">right there it&#39;s it&#39;s you know you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:02:32.710" end="01:02:37.420" style="s2">both of those things together seem to be</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.780" end="01:02:38.950" style="s2">required in that aesthetic yeah that is</p>

<p begin="01:02:50.650" end="01:02:54.400" style="s2">goes back to I think this carries point</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.910" end="01:02:58.030" style="s2">about how it opens us up to the truth</p>

<p begin="01:03:00.490" end="01:03:05.200" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about you know Plato</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.690" end="01:03:06.850" style="s2">talks about you know the response to</p>

<p begin="01:03:06.850" end="01:03:10.930" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to connect back to Jordans</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.080" end="01:03:12.310" style="s2">notion of an active integrity and active</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.930" end="01:03:16.270" style="s2">integration it was</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.310" end="01:03:19.630" style="s2">- beauty is the the the impulse to make</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.270" end="01:03:21.310" style="s2">beauty like to generate beauty right so</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.630" end="01:03:22.720" style="s2">Plato Plato sees that the true</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.310" end="01:03:25.120" style="s2">experience of beauty is you want to give</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.720" end="01:03:26.380" style="s2">birth to beauty right you won&#39;t it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.120" end="01:03:27.640" style="s2">only when you&#39;re in conformity and</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.380" end="01:03:28.660" style="s2">wanting to give birth that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.640" end="01:03:30.010" style="s2">actually in count and that&#39;s how he</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.660" end="01:03:32.080" style="s2">continued that&#39;s who he&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.010" end="01:03:34.900" style="s2">contrast beauty with just something that</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.080" end="01:03:37.900" style="s2">gives us pleasure and then I&#39;m wondering</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.900" end="01:03:40.180" style="s2">how this intersects with the two</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.900" end="01:03:43.510" style="s2">epistemologies that have have tended to</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.180" end="01:03:44.980" style="s2">sort of warp this there&#39;s as you said</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.510" end="01:03:48.460" style="s2">Chris there&#39;s a kind of empiricism that</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.980" end="01:03:50.320" style="s2">just excludes this completely and then</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.460" end="01:03:52.810" style="s2">there&#39;s a romanticism that just says no</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.320" end="01:03:55.420" style="s2">no no Beauty is something that I express</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.810" end="01:03:58.480" style="s2">I press on to the world and what it does</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.420" end="01:04:00.880" style="s2">is disclose myself giving rather than</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.480" end="01:04:02.710" style="s2">calling me beyond it it discloses it</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.880" end="01:04:04.090" style="s2">powerfully it&#39;s not I want to say right</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.710" end="01:04:06.220" style="s2">clearly that&#39;s a that&#39;s a bit of a</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.090" end="01:04:08.110" style="s2">caricature of Romanticism that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.220" end="01:04:11.590" style="s2">would call decadent Romanticism there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.110" end="01:04:13.960" style="s2">obviously individual romantics that move</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.590" end="01:04:16.000" style="s2">what very significantly from what it</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.960" end="01:04:17.710" style="s2">doesn&#39;t close but I think it&#39;s fair to</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.000" end="01:04:19.960" style="s2">say that it&#39;s definitely a widely</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.710" end="01:04:22.650" style="s2">disseminated and accepted cultural</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.960" end="01:04:24.730" style="s2">pattern around a romantic</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.650" end="01:04:26.800" style="s2">misinterpretation of beauty that is</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.730" end="01:04:30.280" style="s2">holding us in thrall to a very very</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.800" end="01:04:34.180" style="s2">significant like where Beauty losses</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.280" end="01:04:36.190" style="s2">integrity somehow and stop yeah because</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.180" end="01:04:39.220" style="s2">we&#39;re doing is we&#39;re taking credit we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.190" end="01:04:40.660" style="s2">taking credit for it okay it&#39;s it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.220" end="01:04:43.030" style="s2">that it&#39;s like the hi to Gary and</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.660" end="01:04:45.730" style="s2">technology it&#39;s a tional beauty it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.030" end="01:04:48.070" style="s2">service to us right right rather than we</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.730" end="01:04:50.410" style="s2">right rather than we are in service to</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.070" end="01:04:52.360" style="s2">it it&#39;s not that it&#39;s it&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.410" end="01:04:56.680" style="s2">subjectivity is deserving of attention</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.360" end="01:04:58.360" style="s2">not the beautiful itself that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.680" end="01:05:00.610" style="s2">and then in the inverse of that the end</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.360" end="01:05:03.940" style="s2">the inverse of of that problem is then</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.610" end="01:05:07.320" style="s2">then the the the worshipfulness right</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.940" end="01:05:09.970" style="s2">yeah the idolatrous worship of beauty</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.320" end="01:05:14.940" style="s2">the inverse of the narcissistic problem</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.970" end="01:05:16.990" style="s2">yes of it&#39;s subjective valorisation yes</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.940" end="01:05:17.980" style="s2">yeah I mean you can think about a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.990" end="01:05:20.710" style="s2">interesting things that come out of that</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.980" end="01:05:23.410" style="s2">has to do with the the failure to close</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.710" end="01:05:25.930" style="s2">the generative origin and source of the</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.410" end="01:05:27.190" style="s2">purpose and meaning of beauty and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.930" end="01:05:29.619" style="s2">again if we think about from an</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.190" end="01:05:31.390" style="s2">evolutionary perspective a landscape is</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.619" end="01:05:34.180" style="s2">beautiful because to venture into that</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.390" end="01:05:36.430" style="s2">landscape is bountiful once Weaver made</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.180" end="01:05:39.010" style="s2">it an artifact it did not actually close</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.430" end="01:05:40.300" style="s2">with it a woman is beautiful because</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.010" end="01:05:42.430" style="s2">ultimately she will give birth to</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.300" end="01:05:44.170" style="s2">beautiful children right is actually</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.430" end="01:05:45.880" style="s2">don&#39;t actually go through the entire</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.170" end="01:05:47.500" style="s2">loop and come all the way to the end and</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.880" end="01:05:50.440" style="s2">play it all the way through as a</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.500" end="01:05:51.940" style="s2">generative enactment we&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.440" end="01:05:53.770" style="s2">something which is deeply in violation</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.940" end="01:05:57.550" style="s2">of the thing that God is here so I think</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.770" end="01:05:59.349" style="s2">there&#39;s a powerful warning in that so we</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.550" end="01:06:01.510" style="s2">got the waken we&#39;ve got to bring to the</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.349" end="01:06:04.510" style="s2">fore that deal logos the beautification</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.510" end="01:06:10.380" style="s2">with India logos is trying to get us to</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.510" end="01:06:13.270" style="s2">give birth to a new way a new right ass</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.380" end="01:06:15.280" style="s2">that&#39;s honor it to honor it is to listen</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.270" end="01:06:16.750" style="s2">to it and to listen to it be drawn into</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.280" end="01:06:17.589" style="s2">it to be drawn into it is to be both</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.750" end="01:06:20.650" style="s2">resourced</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.589" end="01:06:23.680" style="s2">but also to be challenged give her that</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.650" end="01:06:26.470" style="s2">which is calling us yes yes very much so</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.680" end="01:06:28.720" style="s2">the socratic midwifery goes to being not</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.470" end="01:06:32.530" style="s2">only something between people but also</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.720" end="01:06:35.920" style="s2">between people and the world yes yes and</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.530" end="01:06:39.430" style="s2">then between people and themselves yes</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.920" end="01:06:41.200" style="s2">totally ignores requests yes the deep</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.430" end="01:06:43.180" style="s2">interconnection between Socratic soft</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.200" end="01:06:45.099" style="s2">knowledge not autobiographical self</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.180" end="01:06:48.730" style="s2">knowledge but Socratic soft knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.099" end="01:06:50.230" style="s2">and the ability to do this yeah I think</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.730" end="01:06:51.940" style="s2">that&#39;s a deeply important point you just</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.230" end="01:06:54.430" style="s2">put your finger on that shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.940" end="01:06:57.010" style="s2">excluded because that is that that is</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.430" end="01:06:59.619" style="s2">the alternative to subjectivity right</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.010" end="01:07:02.079" style="s2">Socratic self-knowledge which sets you</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.619" end="01:07:05.950" style="s2">in to the aspiration to be other than</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.079" end="01:07:09.880" style="s2">you are is the opposite of of</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.950" end="01:07:12.490" style="s2">subjectivity yeah hmm even sovereignty</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.880" end="01:07:17.890" style="s2">yes yes even Socrates isn&#39;t isn&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.490" end="01:07:20.500" style="s2">Socrates famously so but famously Amos</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.890" end="01:07:22.450" style="s2">Lee he&#39;s a topos right you can&#39;t put him</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.500" end="01:07:25.210" style="s2">into a category and it constantly is</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.450" end="01:07:27.970" style="s2">Metaxas he&#39;s inter categorical both</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.210" end="01:07:30.309" style="s2">horizontally and aspirationally and and</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.970" end="01:07:32.799" style="s2">ayah now also ontological II he&#39;s inter</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.309" end="01:07:35.010" style="s2">categorical mmm-hmm which is why he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.799" end="01:07:37.200" style="s2">both subject and object tere yes</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.010" end="01:07:38.850" style="s2">Socrates then you want to be Socrates</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.200" end="01:07:40.740" style="s2">simultaneously</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.850" end="01:07:42.200" style="s2">which helps which helps to then obviate</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.740" end="01:07:44.430" style="s2">the possibility that he become</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.200" end="01:07:47.490" style="s2">worshipful in the wrong sense of his</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.430" end="01:07:49.230" style="s2">beauty huh oh and that&#39;s Gerard&#39;s notion</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.490" end="01:07:51.630" style="s2">right Gerard&#39;s notion about the</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.230" end="01:07:55.530" style="s2">malevolent mimesis that envy and</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.630" end="01:07:59.310" style="s2">covetousness are right the are the you</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.530" end="01:08:03.030" style="s2">know as the dark side of admiration</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.310" end="01:08:05.340" style="s2">right that instead of wanting to aspire</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.030" end="01:08:07.740" style="s2">to be like Socrates or to be like Christ</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.340" end="01:08:09.990" style="s2">one wants to consume them into one</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.740" end="01:08:13.520" style="s2">subjectivity even one wants to subject</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.990" end="01:08:16.280" style="s2">them completely to one ego hmm</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.520" end="01:08:19.140" style="s2">yeah and I was talking with Nora Bateson</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.280" end="01:08:21.900" style="s2">this morning and she was pointing out</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.140" end="01:08:24.320" style="s2">that the the present context creates the</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.900" end="01:08:28.010" style="s2">situation that in relationship to</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.320" end="01:08:32.700" style="s2">identity it&#39;s a bit like being a a</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.010" end="01:08:34.650" style="s2">gingerbread man made of certain sort of</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.700" end="01:08:37.200" style="s2">low-viscosity goo that happens to still</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.650" end="01:08:39.180" style="s2">have the mold on it and then you pull</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.200" end="01:08:40.890" style="s2">the mold away mmm</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.180" end="01:08:42.870" style="s2">and it begins to ooze out of its shape</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.890" end="01:08:45.210" style="s2">and we&#39;ve become so accustomed to</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.870" end="01:08:46.920" style="s2">alienating ourselves into a context that</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.210" end="01:08:48.660" style="s2">is not of our own making and to imagine</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.920" end="01:08:50.640" style="s2">that that context the shape look the</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.660" end="01:08:52.560" style="s2">form that we&#39;ve actually adapted to is</p>

<p begin="01:16:05.780" end="01:16:09.799" style="s2">coordination is their arm becomes</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.669" end="01:16:12.619" style="s2">immovable but it also simultaneously</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.799" end="01:16:14.809" style="s2">feels more alive and supple to them and</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.619" end="01:16:16.339" style="s2">so that&#39;s that&#39;s pong and it sounds to</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.809" end="01:16:18.049" style="s2">me like what we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.339" end="01:16:20.599" style="s2">all right is is that you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.049" end="01:16:23.599" style="s2">trying to get whatever we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.599" end="01:16:26.460" style="s2">pong argue so that can be struck by</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.599" end="01:16:27.930" style="s2">beauty and open to the world</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.460" end="01:16:29.400" style="s2">or we should also mention the other side</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.930" end="01:16:31.200" style="s2">of it is that the movable arm becomes</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.400" end="01:16:33.750" style="s2">the thing that can do for anything in</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.200" end="01:16:35.520" style="s2">the world yes exactly it&#39;s multi act</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.750" end="01:16:39.870" style="s2">that&#39;s the whole point right the whole</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.520" end="01:16:42.690" style="s2">point of it is it has its this nexus</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.870" end="01:16:45.390" style="s2">point between force and flexibility it</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.690" end="01:16:47.760" style="s2">has tremendous resect ivities but also a</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.390" end="01:16:49.290" style="s2">tremendous capacity for redirecting</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.760" end="01:16:51.180" style="s2">which is which is part of what we need</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.290" end="01:16:52.440" style="s2">in the Cairo&#39;s right we have to receive</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.180" end="01:16:54.960" style="s2">them we&#39;ve been talking a lot about the</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.440" end="01:16:57.150" style="s2">receiving but what pong brings is is we</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.960" end="01:17:00.320" style="s2">also need the ability to redirect right</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.150" end="01:17:02.730" style="s2">properly yes yep that&#39;s exactly it now</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.320" end="01:17:05.340" style="s2">what I&#39;m noticing is also then the</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.730" end="01:17:06.570" style="s2">context of the changing state of context</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.340" end="01:17:11.370" style="s2">we&#39;ve talked about this a few times</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.570" end="01:17:13.860" style="s2">there&#39;s pace the world is moving faster</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.370" end="01:17:15.960" style="s2">just changing more rapidly and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.860" end="01:17:18.180" style="s2">often said this in very close</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.960" end="01:17:20.790" style="s2">conversations it the challenge has very</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.180" end="01:17:25.680" style="s2">little to do with how do we how do I say</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.790" end="01:17:28.290" style="s2">this right overcome or let&#39;s go overcome</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.680" end="01:17:30.750" style="s2">the structures that we currently find</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.290" end="01:17:32.219" style="s2">ourselves engaged with human build</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.750" end="01:17:33.930" style="s2">structures that&#39;s actually not the</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.219" end="01:17:36.239" style="s2">challenge really to convince remove or</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.930" end="01:17:38.670" style="s2">change a break reality it&#39;s changing</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.239" end="01:17:40.320" style="s2">fastness the velocity of change will</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.670" end="01:17:42.570" style="s2">destroy those structures they cannot</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.320" end="01:17:44.489" style="s2">stand before it the only challenge is to</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.570" end="01:17:47.100" style="s2">retrieve this place that you called Hong</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.489" end="01:17:48.960" style="s2">Lei yeah we can achieve that we can</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.100" end="01:17:50.430" style="s2">become the movable arm that and that</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.960" end="01:17:53.160" style="s2">alone is that which could endure that in</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.430" end="01:17:55.710" style="s2">context anywhere yes it&#39;s as simple as</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.160" end="01:17:57.330" style="s2">that right right so that&#39;s the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.710" end="01:17:59.040" style="s2">integrity you&#39;re talking about two prong</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.330" end="01:18:00.630" style="s2">is the kind of integrity you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.040" end="01:18:02.880" style="s2">to you&#39;re trying to articulate is that</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.630" end="01:18:05.550" style="s2">fair Jordan that&#39;s right so it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.880" end="01:18:08.040" style="s2">an invitation it&#39;s just an invitation to</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.550" end="01:18:10.680" style="s2">be part of that only that only kind of</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.040" end="01:18:13.020" style="s2">way of being the only possible way of</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.680" end="01:18:14.190" style="s2">being the kid in fact long endure the</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.020" end="01:18:17.100" style="s2">context into which we were for sure</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.190" end="01:18:18.590" style="s2">entering anything wants to survive must</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.100" end="01:18:22.050" style="s2">do that as simple as that</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.590" end="01:18:24.330" style="s2">so as we&#39;re talking I keep seeing</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.050" end="01:18:28.710" style="s2">through this metaphor of sitting at the</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.330" end="01:18:30.660" style="s2">fire and us and then noticing the</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.710" end="01:18:32.880" style="s2">darkness behind us and the glow on your</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.660" end="01:18:35.820" style="s2">face and listening and hearing you</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.880" end="01:18:38.070" style="s2">describe like as you were moving your</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.820" end="01:18:40.020" style="s2">hands and talking about this having you</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.070" end="01:18:40.289" style="s2">described like out there if you go like</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.020" end="01:18:42.239" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.289" end="01:18:45.149" style="s2">if you go like this and you just the</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.239" end="01:18:48.479" style="s2">invitation is out there like the sense</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.149" end="01:18:51.299" style="s2">of the darkness beyond us is almost like</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.479" end="01:18:56.669" style="s2">we&#39;re leading in talking about how to</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.299" end="01:18:58.379" style="s2">how to be there right how to in the the</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.669" end="01:19:00.859" style="s2">darkness opening up and becoming</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.379" end="01:19:04.739" style="s2">distinct and it&#39;s really interesting how</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.859" end="01:19:06.389" style="s2">pertinent that symbol is I&#39;m seeing</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.739" end="01:19:10.519" style="s2">through that symbol and with that symbol</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.389" end="01:19:12.839" style="s2">here okay can I just go beyond almost I</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.519" end="01:19:14.879" style="s2">was looking for Mary and officially</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.839" end="01:19:20.789" style="s2">proposed that is how we should be out</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.879" end="01:19:24.809" style="s2">there yes and what&#39;s weighted mean is</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.789" end="01:19:26.609" style="s2">precisely how a game for the if you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.809" end="01:19:29.669" style="s2">allow me if we&#39;re tidying into the</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.609" end="01:19:33.510" style="s2">darkness you have the moving pong but</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.669" end="01:19:37.649" style="s2">it&#39;s also it&#39;s attractive it&#39;s beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.510" end="01:19:40.439" style="s2">right it&#39;s beautiful and therefore</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.649" end="01:19:42.499" style="s2">liable to be imitated yes and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.439" end="01:19:45.749" style="s2">self to imitation Oh</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.499" end="01:19:48.359" style="s2">exactly but the correct kind of not the</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.749" end="01:19:51.059" style="s2">malevolent something minista&#39;s but the</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.359" end="01:19:52.979" style="s2">aspirational mimesis an invitation to</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.059" end="01:19:55.319" style="s2">become a part of to become a full</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.979" end="01:19:57.929" style="s2">participant symmetric participant in</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.319" end="01:20:02.149" style="s2">always because on loses all integrity</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.929" end="01:20:02.149" style="s2">the moment if it falls out of that yes</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.539" end="01:20:10.349" style="s2">so the darkness has occurred for me as</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.699" end="01:20:14.999" style="s2">we&#39;ve been sitting here it went from it</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.349" end="01:20:20.030" style="s2">went from some version of opaque and not</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.999" end="01:20:23.999" style="s2">something to go towards to glimmering</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.030" end="01:20:29.219" style="s2">shimmering beautiful that&#39;s when that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.999" end="01:20:30.319" style="s2">that sorry guy I hope I&#39;ll accept your</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.219" end="01:20:32.789" style="s2">apology</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.319" end="01:20:35.579" style="s2">but only for a completely didn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.789" end="01:20:38.519" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna toss in there I know you you</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.579" end="01:20:40.079" style="s2">you won I mean that&#39;s cuz that was just</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.519" end="01:20:42.419" style="s2">gonna riff off of what you just said I</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.079" end="01:20:46.739" style="s2">mean that&#39;s what happens as that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.419" end="01:20:49.799" style="s2">happens as as the as the spirit as it</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.739" end="01:20:51.269" style="s2">were of the campfire becomes hosted by</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.799" end="01:20:54.690" style="s2">each of the participants that gather</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.269" end="01:20:57.000" style="s2">around it the darkness itself becomes</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.690" end="01:21:01.560" style="s2">right the darkness itself is befriended</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.000" end="01:21:04.740" style="s2">and so its presence stops being a source</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.560" end="01:21:08.490" style="s2">of disquiet and starts to become a</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.740" end="01:21:11.520" style="s2">presence of that more mnestheus ink into</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.490" end="01:21:14.790" style="s2">the dialogic fire the darkness</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.520" end="01:21:17.280" style="s2">penetrates us but it penetrates us in a</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.790" end="01:21:22.650" style="s2">way that envelops us into the more</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.280" end="01:21:25.380" style="s2">mnestheus can pretend somebody got their</p>

<p begin="01:21:46.080" end="01:21:55.320" style="s2">is a sense in which I&#39;m I&#39;m getting</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.060" end="01:21:57.510" style="s2">there&#39;s a certain obvious nasai dialo</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.320" end="01:22:00.390" style="s2">goes do I do this like this was</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.510" end="01:22:03.180" style="s2">exemplified that for me yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.390" end="01:22:08.700" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly what I was trying to call</p>

<p begin="01:22:13.830" end="01:22:18.750" style="s2">feature that Chris and I talked about</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.790" end="01:22:20.640" style="s2">the the India logo through one of the</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.750" end="01:22:24.050" style="s2">skills of dialectic as a psychic</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.640" end="01:22:27.630" style="s2">technology is to constantly move between</p>

<p begin="01:22:27.630" end="01:22:35.550" style="s2">then exemplifying it like modally and</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.560" end="01:22:38.130" style="s2">we&#39;re constantly bike is the way</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.550" end="01:22:39.720" style="s2">constantly rebounds between us you know</p>

<p begin="01:22:43.890" end="01:22:53.040" style="s2">exemplified and that that to me is a</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.380" end="01:22:56.700" style="s2">tamiya is is well it is very attractive</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.040" end="01:23:00.090" style="s2">it really draws me and fascinates me</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.700" end="01:23:04.920" style="s2">because it harkens to go what Chris said</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.090" end="01:23:07.920" style="s2">it harkens to a potato II and us that</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.920" end="01:23:11.070" style="s2">can respond to the depth</p>
