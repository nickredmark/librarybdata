<p begin="00:00:50.010" end="00:00:58.640" style="s2">was an attempt by me to meditate on what</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.489" end="00:00:58.640" style="s2">I thought was going on through reporting</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.739" end="00:01:07.290" style="s2">sort of real-time history writing and</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.100" end="00:01:09.060" style="s2">also some philosophizing about the</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.290" end="00:01:11.970" style="s2">deeper reasons why it was going on I</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.060" end="00:01:13.890" style="s2">wanted to take the opportunity to not</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.970" end="00:01:17.190" style="s2">just describe events but describe why</p>

<p begin="00:01:17.190" end="00:01:23.580" style="s2">take a step back from what was front</p>

<p begin="00:01:23.580" end="00:01:30.990" style="s2">it why was it happening and I thought</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.530" end="00:01:33.299" style="s2">that they were broadly speaking two</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.990" end="00:01:35.310" style="s2">components one was the the world</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.299" end="00:01:38.189" style="s2">appearing to want to come to Europe and</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.310" end="00:01:40.549" style="s2">the other was what had happened in</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.189" end="00:01:45.180" style="s2">Europe the men that this was the case</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.549" end="00:01:46.710" style="s2">what was it about us that meant for good</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.180" end="00:01:53.810" style="s2">and ill that that was going to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.710" end="00:01:56.250" style="s2">allowed and possible and I wanted to I</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.810" end="00:02:00.780" style="s2">wanted to try to address those the</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.250" end="00:02:05.520" style="s2">deeper tones because I thought they were</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.780" end="00:02:07.560" style="s2">everywhere you couldn&#39;t stand borders of</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.520" end="00:02:10.890" style="s2">various European countries and not think</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.560" end="00:02:14.280" style="s2">of history all the time there is</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.890" end="00:02:16.409" style="s2">something about Europe because we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.280" end="00:02:18.400" style="s2">been a crucible of</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.409" end="00:02:23.079" style="s2">considerable amount of civilization for</p>

<p begin="00:02:23.079" end="00:02:31.569" style="s2">a lot of places positively harmony with</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.860" end="00:02:33.340" style="s2">history and things that have been</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.569" end="00:02:34.599" style="s2">extraordinary and great and things that</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.340" end="00:02:37.420" style="s2">have been worse than anything that ever</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.599" end="00:02:40.680" style="s2">anyone ever came up with and you draw a</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.420" end="00:02:43.390" style="s2">link in that book between a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.680" end="00:02:46.359" style="s2">religious crisis in Europe that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.390" end="00:02:50.349" style="s2">lost our values and immigration which is</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.359" end="00:02:55.120" style="s2">something that people don&#39;t like people</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.349" end="00:02:56.440" style="s2">don&#39;t like yeah I noticed that could you</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.120" end="00:03:00.280" style="s2">explain how this piece is dealing</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.440" end="00:03:03.040" style="s2">together well broadly speaking because</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.280" end="00:03:07.120" style="s2">we like to think that everybody in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.040" end="00:03:09.790" style="s2">world is like us which among other</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.120" end="00:03:11.769" style="s2">things is somewhat presumptuous and from</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.790" end="00:03:14.859" style="s2">a lot of travel in a lot of places over</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.769" end="00:03:17.470" style="s2">a lot of years now I come to conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.859" end="00:03:19.959" style="s2">there are enormous number of things that</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.470" end="00:03:22.090" style="s2">unite people across the whole world but</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.959" end="00:03:24.699" style="s2">there&#39;s an awful lot of difference as</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.090" end="00:03:26.410" style="s2">well and it isn&#39;t just the case that</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.699" end="00:03:29.889" style="s2">we&#39;re all after the same things or we</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.410" end="00:03:31.299" style="s2">all believe the same things it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.889" end="00:03:34.359" style="s2">not the case that we all have the same</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.299" end="00:03:37.329" style="s2">views or could have the same views or</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.359" end="00:03:40.780" style="s2">should have the same views and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.329" end="00:03:43.150" style="s2">obvious at all to me that if you walk</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.780" end="00:03:45.280" style="s2">into another continent even if you</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.150" end="00:03:47.349" style="s2">become a citizen that you inevitably</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.280" end="00:03:50.169" style="s2">become as much of that continent as</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.349" end="00:03:52.060" style="s2">anyone else who&#39;s ever been there and it</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.169" end="00:03:55.840" style="s2">seems to me that numbers matter and</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.060" end="00:03:59.699" style="s2">speed matters and there are a whole set</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.840" end="00:04:02.560" style="s2">of very obvious demonstrations of that</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.699" end="00:04:05.500" style="s2">and I don&#39;t blame individual migrants or</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.560" end="00:04:08.290" style="s2">groups of migrants for that but if we</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.500" end="00:04:11.949" style="s2">were to transplant an entire Welsh</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.290" end="00:04:15.669" style="s2">mining village to Kashmir you would not</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.949" end="00:04:18.519" style="s2">expect that village to become Kashmir</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.669" end="00:04:19.840" style="s2">overnight or even in generations</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.519" end="00:04:21.760" style="s2">possibly</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.840" end="00:04:23.740" style="s2">then most likely retain a lot of their</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.760" end="00:04:30.430" style="s2">own customs and have their own views and</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.740" end="00:04:35.290" style="s2">their own music even and yet we pretend</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.430" end="00:04:36.700" style="s2">that the opposite in Reverse is not very</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.290" end="00:04:38.919" style="s2">interesting not going to have any</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.700" end="00:04:41.350" style="s2">implications implications and not have</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.919" end="00:04:44.400" style="s2">any consequences it&#39;s all going to keep</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.350" end="00:04:46.660" style="s2">going on I just don&#39;t think it will I</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.400" end="00:04:47.710" style="s2">think it&#39;s very obvious that it won&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.660" end="00:04:49.150" style="s2">think there&#39;s a massive amount of</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.710" end="00:04:51.430" style="s2">evidence some of which only some of</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.150" end="00:04:54.520" style="s2">which I put in the book that says it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.430" end="00:04:56.320" style="s2">just be very different and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.520" end="00:04:58.290" style="s2">people say it&#39;ll be very different great</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.320" end="00:05:02.260" style="s2">some people say it&#39;ll be very different</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.290" end="00:05:03.880" style="s2">that&#39;s the problem but I have very</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.260" end="00:05:06.490" style="s2">little respect or time for people who</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.880" end="00:05:09.220" style="s2">think it&#39;s just all gonna keep being the</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.490" end="00:05:11.590" style="s2">same there&#39;ll be good things not be bad</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.220" end="00:05:14.380" style="s2">things I&#39;m very willing to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.590" end="00:05:15.910" style="s2">both but if everyone else only talks</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.380" end="00:05:19.510" style="s2">about the good I can&#39;t help myself from</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.910" end="00:05:20.650" style="s2">talking about some of the bad it feels</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.510" end="00:05:22.300" style="s2">like a lot of people are feeling the</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.650" end="00:05:26.860" style="s2">same sort of disconnect at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.300" end="00:05:30.100" style="s2">what do you make of that yes I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.860" end="00:05:31.720" style="s2">think that the disconnect you point to</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.100" end="00:05:35.260" style="s2">the disconnect I&#39;ve tried to write about</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.720" end="00:05:39.820" style="s2">is when people become aware that they</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.260" end="00:05:41.710" style="s2">are coming apart from the source of what</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.820" end="00:05:43.090" style="s2">got them to where they are or to put it</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.710" end="00:05:45.100" style="s2">another way</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.090" end="00:05:47.140" style="s2">that you become aware that your soaring</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.100" end="00:05:51.490" style="s2">off the branch of the tree that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.140" end="00:05:56.979" style="s2">sitting on doesn&#39;t necessarily mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.490" end="00:05:59.550" style="s2">fatal but it&#39;s it&#39;s an instinct that a</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.979" end="00:06:02.120" style="s2">lot of people have and I think has been</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.550" end="00:06:07.070" style="s2">going on for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.120" end="00:06:08.150" style="s2">more than a century and yes I&#39;ve tried</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.070" end="00:06:09.350" style="s2">to write about it because I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.150" end="00:06:16.270" style="s2">something that doesn&#39;t get written about</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.350" end="00:06:19.820" style="s2">very much I said somewhere that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.270" end="00:06:21.320" style="s2">we&#39;re living in an era where maybe one</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.820" end="00:06:22.430" style="s2">of the first times in human history or</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.320" end="00:06:25.210" style="s2">serving one of the first times we know</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.430" end="00:06:30.400" style="s2">of where there is no overarching</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.210" end="00:06:30.400" style="s2">explanation for what we&#39;re doing and</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.490" end="00:06:38.840" style="s2">that&#39;s a big thing to miss it&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.090" end="00:06:41.060" style="s2">thing to ignore and maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.840" end="00:06:43.220" style="s2">inevitable that people wouldn&#39;t spend</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.060" end="00:06:46.340" style="s2">much time thinking about it publicly</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.220" end="00:06:47.870" style="s2">because there&#39;s an awful lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.340" end="00:06:49.820" style="s2">questions that come in the wake of that</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.870" end="00:06:51.889" style="s2">one and I think you&#39;ve said something</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.820" end="00:06:53.800" style="s2">like this before that some of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.889" end="00:06:56.960" style="s2">criticisms of strange death of Europe</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.800" end="00:06:59.210" style="s2">focused on the immigration issue but</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.960" end="00:07:03.740" style="s2">very few of them focused on your central</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.210" end="00:07:06.560" style="s2">point yes I it went away it was a</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.740" end="00:07:09.919" style="s2">disappointment to me when his book came</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.560" end="00:07:11.479" style="s2">out that I was just very struck there</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.919" end="00:07:14.479" style="s2">basically two major issues in the book</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.479" end="00:07:16.729" style="s2">one is I mean to sort of make it crude</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.479" end="00:07:20.660" style="s2">one is about them as it were people</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.729" end="00:07:22.400" style="s2">coming in to Western societies and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.660" end="00:07:26.360" style="s2">other is the US as it were what is the</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.400" end="00:07:28.849" style="s2">Western society already and I was just</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.360" end="00:07:30.919" style="s2">very struck that the such criticism of</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.849" end="00:07:32.780" style="s2">that as there was focused solely on the</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.919" end="00:07:34.220" style="s2">first part of that and that that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:20:53.060" end="00:21:00.080" style="s2">about some of that bit because i think</p>

<p begin="00:21:00.080" end="00:21:05.510" style="s2">the absolute best of this but there is a</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.970" end="00:21:07.910" style="s2">tendency sometimes to read any new</p>

<p begin="00:21:34.680" end="00:21:40.830" style="s2">and everything I&#39;m sure I do it but but</p>

<p begin="00:23:03.270" end="00:23:09.510" style="s2">in general but then you also talk about</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.970" end="00:23:12.840" style="s2">Sweden and Sweden looks like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.510" end="00:23:14.700" style="s2">possible that native Swedes will be a</p>

<p begin="00:23:22.050" end="00:23:28.710" style="s2">think it&#39;s only colonialism I say that</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.210" end="00:23:30.540" style="s2">maybe as you point out Sweden not a</p>

<p begin="00:23:30.540" end="00:23:39.960" style="s2">Britain was Germany did start the Second</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.730" end="00:23:42.630" style="s2">World War Britain did not but we all</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.960" end="00:23:47.430" style="s2">have been persuaded to share a certain</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.630" end="00:23:48.930" style="s2">amount of German guilt seems to me you</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.430" end="00:23:50.850" style="s2">can easily say and it&#39;s happened to me</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.930" end="00:23:54.210" style="s2">many times in discussions and debates</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.850" end="00:23:56.550" style="s2">you know look what we did in Europe the</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.210" end="00:23:58.140" style="s2">Second World War you can say that in</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.550" end="00:24:00.810" style="s2">London you can certain audience of Brits</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.140" end="00:24:03.570" style="s2">and they can be persuaded that they had</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.810" end="00:24:09.000" style="s2">some kind of culpability so there is a</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.570" end="00:24:12.210" style="s2">spreading round as I see it of of guilt</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.000" end="00:24:13.440" style="s2">which which means that the specifics and</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.210" end="00:24:15.680" style="s2">the details become relatively</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.440" end="00:24:15.680" style="s2">unimportant</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.490" end="00:24:25.710" style="s2">so that Europeans from Thessalonica to</p>

<p begin="00:24:43.290" end="00:24:52.340" style="s2">interested in why we fought the idea</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.740" end="00:24:54.810" style="s2">here so much why we are so able to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.340" end="00:24:56.700" style="s2">encouraged in to this idea of guilt I</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.810" end="00:24:58.830" style="s2">think as all sorts of religious and post</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.700" end="00:25:01.560" style="s2">religious reasons for that I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:25:01.560" end="00:25:09.240" style="s2">in how if ever we can get out of that</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.550" end="00:25:10.980" style="s2">guilt I cite Nietzsche on this because</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.240" end="00:25:15.480" style="s2">Nietzsche foresaw some of this when he&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:25:20.000" end="00:25:26.490" style="s2">which is I think the situation we are</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.290" end="00:25:28.860" style="s2">currently in I how how do how do British</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.490" end="00:25:31.380" style="s2">people get over colonialism at you think</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.860" end="00:25:34.730" style="s2">most of Britain has I think this is sort</p>

<p begin="00:25:41.130" end="00:25:44.399" style="s2">think they&#39;ll succeed</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.090" end="00:25:46.179" style="s2">I think you can do that much more</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.399" end="00:25:47.980" style="s2">successfully with the German population</p>

<p begin="00:25:47.980" end="00:25:51.129" style="s2">were already seeing and we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.749" end="00:25:52.929" style="s2">see a lot more in the years ahead as</p>

<p begin="00:25:52.929" end="00:25:57.340" style="s2">didn&#39;t do it and I think we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.840" end="00:25:58.570" style="s2">have to take an attitude towards that</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.340" end="00:26:00.279" style="s2">we&#39;re going to have to be able to evolve</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.570" end="00:26:02.320" style="s2">our attitudes towards it and we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.279" end="00:26:04.840" style="s2">to have to have some flexibility about</p>

<p begin="00:26:04.840" end="00:26:07.749" style="s2">not right</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.830" end="00:26:10.299" style="s2">to tell people that they have to carry</p>

<p begin="00:26:19.080" end="00:26:22.779" style="s2">it wouldn&#39;t be right to do it in the</p>

<p begin="00:26:40.980" end="00:26:46.570" style="s2">think as I&#39;ve often said there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.269" end="00:26:49.779" style="s2">problem of masochism in the West</p>

<p begin="00:27:14.289" end="00:27:21.100" style="s2">from therapy yes a thing well I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.210" end="00:27:23.320" style="s2">we&#39;ve done that enough might be an</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.100" end="00:27:25.149" style="s2">instinct this starts to come up more I</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.320" end="00:27:26.259" style="s2">think it I already hear it coming up</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.149" end="00:27:28.389" style="s2">more I&#39;ve heard it more and more since</p>

<p begin="00:27:28.389" end="00:27:31.690" style="s2">only 18 months ago I think a lot of this</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.460" end="00:27:36.610" style="s2">is I think a lot of the weather has</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.690" end="00:27:41.110" style="s2">changed but there&#39;s also this problem</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.610" end="00:27:43.419" style="s2">about memory in general which is we know</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.110" end="00:27:50.270" style="s2">that a reasonable and civilized society</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.419" end="00:27:52.190" style="s2">ought to remember it&#39;s it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.270" end="00:27:55.040" style="s2">the former Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.190" end="00:27:56.990" style="s2">once said that as you know Isaiah Berlin</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.040" end="00:28:02.000" style="s2">was once asked what it was what it meant</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.990" end="00:28:04.790" style="s2">to be Jewish and he as a berlin said he</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.000" end="00:28:09.440" style="s2">thought it meant to have meant to have a</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.790" end="00:28:14.840" style="s2">sense of history and rabbis Sachs once</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.440" end="00:28:16.130" style="s2">said no as I was almost right he said to</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.840" end="00:28:22.490" style="s2">be Jewish means to have a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.130" end="00:28:23.929" style="s2">memory to take that and make it not just</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.490" end="00:28:26.450" style="s2">the Jewish thing which I think it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.929" end="00:28:30.620" style="s2">but I think that I think civilized</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.450" end="00:28:32.840" style="s2">people have to have a sense of memory we</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.620" end="00:28:34.130" style="s2">know in Europe and we should know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.840" end="00:28:37.040" style="s2">not like I&#39;m saying let&#39;s forget</p>
