<p begin="00:01:41.340" end="00:01:45.119" style="s2">interested in some of my favorite things</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.259" end="00:01:48.600" style="s2">the foundations of complexity science</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.119" end="00:01:50.700" style="s2">and the nature of causality now let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.600" end="00:01:52.890" style="s2">start out with our first question one of</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.700" end="00:01:54.810" style="s2">your new research ideas which you worked</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.890" end="00:01:56.610" style="s2">on with some other folks at SFI and</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.810" end="00:01:58.320" style="s2">elsewhere is that the long-held view</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.610" end="00:02:00.479" style="s2">that complex the emerges from</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.320" end="00:02:02.820" style="s2">interactions among simple components is</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.479" end="00:02:04.799" style="s2">wrong that&#39;s a big challenge the</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.820" end="00:02:07.049" style="s2">convention indeed our mutual friend</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.799" end="00:02:09.420" style="s2">Murray goemon used to remind the SFI</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.049" end="00:02:11.550" style="s2">community regularly that the full name</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.420" end="00:02:13.870" style="s2">of what SFI did wasn&#39;t complexity</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.550" end="00:02:16.989" style="s2">science but rather complexity</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.870" end="00:02:19.720" style="s2">from simplicity tell us about your new</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.989" end="00:02:20.980" style="s2">view haha yes so I don&#39;t want to say</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.720" end="00:02:23.680" style="s2">Murray was wrong because of course</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.980" end="00:02:25.120" style="s2">Murray&#39;s never wrong but um but so</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.680" end="00:02:27.280" style="s2">there&#39;s a sort of nuance that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.120" end="00:02:29.680" style="s2">add to that understanding of how</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.280" end="00:02:31.299" style="s2">complexity arises and I think one of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.680" end="00:02:32.940" style="s2">things that&#39;s that we&#39;re coming to</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.299" end="00:02:35.409" style="s2">understand with better and better</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.940" end="00:02:37.260" style="s2">observation measurement tools is that</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.409" end="00:02:39.700" style="s2">lower levels of organization are not</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.260" end="00:02:41.709" style="s2">necessarily simpler than higher levels</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.700" end="00:02:44.230" style="s2">of organization as an example if you</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.709" end="00:02:45.730" style="s2">look at a eukaryotic cell you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.230" end="00:02:47.410" style="s2">not just and this is really for people</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.730" end="00:02:49.840" style="s2">are not cellular biologist obviously</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.410" end="00:02:51.910" style="s2">it&#39;s not just um you know 10 or so</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.840" end="00:02:54.099" style="s2">organelles floating around in some</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.910" end="00:02:58.060" style="s2">cytoplasm it&#39;s actually an incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.099" end="00:03:00.730" style="s2">complex thing with many many molecular</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.060" end="00:03:02.590" style="s2">houses of molecular motors densely</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.730" end="00:03:04.720" style="s2">packed organelles everything&#39;s optimally</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.590" end="00:03:05.980" style="s2">packed it looks when you when when you</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.720" end="00:03:07.720" style="s2">look at images of these things today</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.980" end="00:03:09.489" style="s2">they look actually like cities do</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.720" end="00:03:11.799" style="s2">especially if you look at a city from</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.489" end="00:03:16.049" style="s2">the point of view of um I sped up like</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.799" end="00:03:18.069" style="s2">in Godfrey Reggio films cornice quasi so</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.049" end="00:03:19.569" style="s2">amazing complexity at the cellular level</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.069" end="00:03:21.340" style="s2">and just recently was discovered for</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.569" end="00:03:23.139" style="s2">example that cells can compute the XOR</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.340" end="00:03:25.870" style="s2">function certain neurons can compute the</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.139" end="00:03:27.630" style="s2">XOR function so also individual cells</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.870" end="00:03:29.889" style="s2">individual neurons are capable of</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.630" end="00:03:32.109" style="s2">incredibly complicated behavior behavior</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.889" end="00:03:34.569" style="s2">that we thought required a larger system</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.109" end="00:03:37.329" style="s2">to perform and so that&#39;s the first</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.569" end="00:03:40.000" style="s2">observation that in fact lower levels of</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.329" end="00:03:42.250" style="s2">organization are a lot more complex than</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.000" end="00:03:45.069" style="s2">we&#39;ve been giving them credit for now</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.250" end="00:03:47.019" style="s2">one could say that well the higher</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.069" end="00:03:48.430" style="s2">levels of organization contain the lower</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.019" end="00:03:50.079" style="s2">levels and so even if they&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.430" end="00:03:52.000" style="s2">complex the higher levels by definition</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.079" end="00:03:55.060" style="s2">are more complex in a sort of Russian</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.000" end="00:03:57.220" style="s2">doll model of complexity but that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.060" end="00:03:59.620" style="s2">really a least as far as I&#39;m concerned a</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.220" end="00:04:01.560" style="s2">very interesting notion of complexity</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.620" end="00:04:04.480" style="s2">that Russian doll model and I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.560" end="00:04:07.090" style="s2">what&#39;s really going on is that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.480" end="00:04:08.709" style="s2">got this incredible complexity lots of</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.090" end="00:04:11.470" style="s2">parts doing complicated things at lower</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.709" end="00:04:13.799" style="s2">levels and then you&#39;ve got the component</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.470" end="00:04:16.239" style="s2">trying to figure out how the world works</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.799" end="00:04:18.940" style="s2">trying to estimate regularities and</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.239" end="00:04:21.070" style="s2">through that process they&#39;re doing what</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.940" end="00:04:22.479" style="s2">we call coarse graining getting a handle</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.070" end="00:04:25.150" style="s2">on what those regularities are what the</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.479" end="00:04:26.730" style="s2">things are in all that complexity that</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.150" end="00:04:28.830" style="s2">they should pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.730" end="00:04:31.500" style="s2">and you get this kind of compression of</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.830" end="00:04:33.720" style="s2">that microscopic complexity and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.500" end="00:04:36.090" style="s2">compression or the coarse graining then</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.720" end="00:04:37.290" style="s2">even though it&#39;s lossy and so you&#39;ve by</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.090" end="00:04:39.810" style="s2">definition when you coarse grain you</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.290" end="00:04:41.520" style="s2">lose information the system also gains</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.810" end="00:04:43.260" style="s2">information because it gains information</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.520" end="00:04:45.990" style="s2">about what the right strategies are</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.260" end="00:04:47.940" style="s2">given those regularities and as a</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.990" end="00:04:50.580" style="s2">consequence of this you get what I call</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.940" end="00:04:52.320" style="s2">a macroscopic expansion that is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.580" end="00:04:53.790" style="s2">capacity for the system to perform new</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.320" end="00:04:56.220" style="s2">functions because it has a better</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.790" end="00:04:57.930" style="s2">understanding of what strategies work in</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.220" end="00:05:00.180" style="s2">a given environment so you have</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.930" end="00:05:02.610" style="s2">microscopic complexity you have a what</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.180" end="00:05:04.260" style="s2">I&#39;m calling an information bottleneck by</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.610" end="00:05:06.480" style="s2">virtue of the coarse graining or the</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.260" end="00:05:08.910" style="s2">compression of the regularities at the</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.480" end="00:05:10.530" style="s2">microscopic scale and then because of</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.910" end="00:05:12.900" style="s2">that information bottleneck you get this</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.530" end="00:05:15.480" style="s2">macroscopic expansion of function such</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.900" end="00:05:17.160" style="s2">where the emergence comes in so as far</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.480" end="00:05:19.440" style="s2">as Murray&#39;s points about complexity from</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.160" end="00:05:21.270" style="s2">simplicity they&#39;re still sort of correct</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.440" end="00:05:23.850" style="s2">in the sense that the information</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.270" end="00:05:25.350" style="s2">bottleneck is simplifying so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.850" end="00:05:28.470" style="s2">getting the complexity through this</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.350" end="00:05:30.060" style="s2">coarse graining in a way but though</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.470" end="00:05:32.220" style="s2">unfortunately I think what&#39;s happened is</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.060" end="00:05:33.420" style="s2">the way people interpret that is they</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.220" end="00:05:36.060" style="s2">think that it means the microscopic</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.420" end="00:05:39.030" style="s2">scale is simple perhaps it is simple to</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.060" end="00:05:40.680" style="s2">go lower right maybe atoms and quarks</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.030" end="00:05:42.150" style="s2">are sort of simple but maybe not maybe</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.680" end="00:05:44.160" style="s2">we dig into them further we&#39;ll find out</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.150" end="00:05:46.890" style="s2">that they&#39;re just as complex hard to say</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.160" end="00:05:48.330" style="s2">well that&#39;s an interesting point Jim and</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.890" end="00:05:50.280" style="s2">I think before we get to atoms and</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.330" end="00:05:52.320" style="s2">quarks we know that prokaryotes are a</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.280" end="00:05:54.630" style="s2">lot more complex and we thought - so</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.320" end="00:05:57.750" style="s2">it&#39;s been discovered that there they can</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.630" end="00:06:00.120" style="s2">perform within a prokaryote complicated</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.750" end="00:06:01.620" style="s2">metabolic functions and they have what</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.120" end="00:06:03.750" style="s2">would be something like seed organelles</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.620" end="00:06:05.430" style="s2">in a compartments so again we</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.750" end="00:06:07.860" style="s2">underestimate the complexity there now</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.430" end="00:06:10.050" style="s2">in terms of you know atoms and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.860" end="00:06:11.910" style="s2">I think one of the one of the things we</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.050" end="00:06:13.620" style="s2">always have to remember is that physical</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.910" end="00:06:15.420" style="s2">systems by virtue of having had many</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.620" end="00:06:18.300" style="s2">more many more hundreds of years to</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.420" end="00:06:20.190" style="s2">study them good science look to us now a</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.300" end="00:06:21.900" style="s2">lot simpler than perhaps they did when</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.190" end="00:06:25.410" style="s2">these things were first being worked out</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.900" end="00:06:28.190" style="s2">right so as you say it&#39;s not entirely</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.410" end="00:06:30.870" style="s2">clear to me that physical systems are</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.190" end="00:06:32.940" style="s2">you know as simple as we like to think I</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.870" end="00:06:35.970" style="s2">think anne-marie&#39;s sort of Eightfold way</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.940" end="00:06:37.740" style="s2">you know you know provide some backing</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.970" end="00:06:40.320" style="s2">for that right yeah he added some</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.740" end="00:06:42.180" style="s2">complexity downward basically right</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.320" end="00:06:43.620" style="s2">from what used to be very simple object</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.180" end="00:06:46.350" style="s2">okay here&#39;s our point proton or neutron</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.620" end="00:06:48.480" style="s2">and there we go no not quite that simple</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.350" end="00:06:50.550" style="s2">exactly as it turns out every time you</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.480" end="00:06:52.260" style="s2">look further what are we fine what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.550" end="00:06:55.170" style="s2">most likely answer the further you look</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.260" end="00:06:57.090" style="s2">not quite so simple so let&#39;s get back to</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.170" end="00:06:59.430" style="s2">this idea of micro complexity and a</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.090" end="00:07:01.560" style="s2">bottleneck it probably helpful for the</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.430" end="00:07:03.330" style="s2">audience to have an actual example and</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.560" end="00:07:05.010" style="s2">maybe something at the level of a cell</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.330" end="00:07:06.690" style="s2">moving up I don&#39;t know what would be a</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.010" end="00:07:08.520" style="s2">good example well let me start with the</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.690" end="00:07:10.530" style="s2">example that I that I&#39;ve that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.520" end="00:07:13.140" style="s2">worked on and where some of these ideas</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.530" end="00:07:15.660" style="s2">originally started or I developed them</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.140" end="00:07:17.940" style="s2">and that&#39;s in actually in primate</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.660" end="00:07:19.410" style="s2">societies and you mentioned I did</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.940" end="00:07:21.210" style="s2">thousands of hours of work observing</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.410" end="00:07:23.610" style="s2">primary societies macaque and chimpanzee</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.210" end="00:07:28.050" style="s2">societies and in the course of that work</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.610" end="00:07:29.580" style="s2">I saw that the the monkeys were sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.050" end="00:07:30.750" style="s2">trying to figure out they were you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.580" end="00:07:31.950" style="s2">this was well known and I don&#39;t leave</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.750" end="00:07:33.510" style="s2">our monkeys have a power structure</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.950" end="00:07:35.850" style="s2">what&#39;s typically called dominance</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.510" end="00:07:37.170" style="s2">hierarchy and they have fighting</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.850" end="00:07:40.020" style="s2">abilities that are kind of intrinsic</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.170" end="00:07:41.730" style="s2">develop over time very slowly but I was</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.020" end="00:07:43.170" style="s2">fighting in those fighting abilities are</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.730" end="00:07:44.850" style="s2">invisible to the other monkeys the</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.170" end="00:07:46.620" style="s2">monkeys have to sort of infer what the</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.850" end="00:07:48.870" style="s2">fighting ability is through fights</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.620" end="00:07:50.490" style="s2">that&#39;s how they learn about who&#39;s weaker</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.870" end="00:07:52.890" style="s2">and stronger they can&#39;t just see it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.490" end="00:07:55.260" style="s2">not like a bird who has a badge on on</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.890" end="00:07:58.110" style="s2">its chest and the badge tells the other</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.260" end="00:08:00.240" style="s2">bird you know how capable that bird is</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.110" end="00:08:02.130" style="s2">of winning a fight the monkeys have to</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.240" end="00:08:03.930" style="s2">have to infer this through fights the</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.130" end="00:08:05.430" style="s2">fighting underlying fighting ability and</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.930" end="00:08:08.130" style="s2">then to use some attacks like a</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.430" end="00:08:09.960" style="s2">pigtailed macaque which is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.130" end="00:08:11.610" style="s2">species that I&#39;ve worked with these</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.960" end="00:08:13.140" style="s2">pigtailed macaques they they have this</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.610" end="00:08:15.330" style="s2">history of fights with other individuals</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.140" end="00:08:16.770" style="s2">and and over that history one individual</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.330" end="00:08:20.220" style="s2">we learned that it&#39;s likely the loose to</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.770" end="00:08:22.230" style="s2">the other and if the asymmetry between</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.220" end="00:08:24.180" style="s2">them is large so that one individual</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.230" end="00:08:26.580" style="s2">knows with a high probability it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.180" end="00:08:29.460" style="s2">to lose that individual omits what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.580" end="00:08:31.890" style="s2">called a subordination signal and it</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.460" end="00:08:35.160" style="s2">emits this signal outside of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.890" end="00:08:37.800" style="s2">agonistic or fight context and it tells</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.160" end="00:08:40.710" style="s2">the receiver of the signal that the</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.800" end="00:08:45.450" style="s2">sender recognizes that it&#39;s likely to</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.710" end="00:08:47.370" style="s2">lose and has agreed to yield if a</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.450" end="00:08:49.680" style="s2">conflict in the future arises it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.370" end="00:08:52.410" style="s2">agreeing that the sender is agreeing to</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.680" end="00:08:53.880" style="s2">a state subordinate state in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.410" end="00:08:56.010" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.880" end="00:08:57.570" style="s2">and so this subordination signal</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.010" end="00:09:00.480" style="s2">summarizes there&#39;s a coarse-grained</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.570" end="00:09:03.420" style="s2">representation of that fight history and</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.480" end="00:09:05.460" style="s2">then the two individuals use it they</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.420" end="00:09:06.780" style="s2">reference it to make decisions about how</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.460" end="00:09:09.570" style="s2">to sort of behave in the future with</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.780" end="00:09:11.190" style="s2">each other now fights do continue but</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.570" end="00:09:12.630" style="s2">they continue at a much lower rate and</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.190" end="00:09:14.310" style="s2">the idea is that it&#39;s like a background</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.630" end="00:09:16.560" style="s2">processing computer science the fights</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.310" end="00:09:18.150" style="s2">are continuing just so something changes</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.560" end="00:09:20.430" style="s2">in the monkey&#39;s fighting ability or</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.150" end="00:09:22.110" style="s2">circumstances that dominance</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.430" end="00:09:24.990" style="s2">relationship that subordination contract</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.110" end="00:09:26.400" style="s2">can be reversed now everyone in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.990" end="00:09:27.510" style="s2">group is doing this they&#39;re all learning</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.400" end="00:09:29.400" style="s2">about each other&#39;s fights they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.510" end="00:09:31.620" style="s2">exchanging these signals and signal is</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.400" end="00:09:33.300" style="s2">highly unidirectional meaning that only</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.620" end="00:09:35.100" style="s2">one individual in the pair gives a</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.300" end="00:09:37.680" style="s2">signal so it&#39;s a very reliable indicator</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.100" end="00:09:39.450" style="s2">of this role and now there&#39;s a network</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.680" end="00:09:40.920" style="s2">of these things or a circuit if you like</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.450" end="00:09:44.190" style="s2">a circuit of these unidirectional</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.920" end="00:09:45.750" style="s2">signals and in that circuit is encoded</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.190" end="00:09:47.580" style="s2">information about the distribution of</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.750" end="00:09:50.700" style="s2">power it&#39;s essentially a mechanism that</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.580" end="00:09:52.440" style="s2">the monkeys have for voting on who they</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.700" end="00:09:54.590" style="s2">collectively perceive to be the most</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.440" end="00:09:57.090" style="s2">capable individual of winning fights</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.590" end="00:09:59.520" style="s2">mm-hmm I like that so you start out with</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.090" end="00:10:01.800" style="s2">a bunch of monkeys fighting which is a</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.520" end="00:10:04.380" style="s2">complicated many-to-many relationship</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.800" end="00:10:06.930" style="s2">complex I would say formally and that</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.380" end="00:10:10.170" style="s2">gets cooked down through presumably some</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.930" end="00:10:12.390" style="s2">genetically inclination to a at least</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.170" end="00:10:15.480" style="s2">fuzzy signal from which individuals say</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.390" end="00:10:18.600" style="s2">I am submissive to you a sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.480" end="00:10:20.460" style="s2">dyadic connection and then all the</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.600" end="00:10:22.080" style="s2">monkeys give out those signals lease all</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.460" end="00:10:25.200" style="s2">the submissive monkeys anyone below the</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.080" end="00:10:28.440" style="s2">Alpha presumably and then that set of</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.200" end="00:10:30.750" style="s2">signals unifies across the field of all</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.440" end="00:10:33.180" style="s2">monkeys in that particular troop to</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.750" end="00:10:35.100" style="s2">establish the kind of complicated</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.180" end="00:10:36.480" style="s2">network relationship of dominance</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.100" end="00:10:38.700" style="s2">hierarchy is that did I get it pretty</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.480" end="00:10:40.800" style="s2">close you did and I&#39;m just gonna change</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.700" end="00:10:42.810" style="s2">a few things and the better understand</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.800" end="00:10:44.670" style="s2">and the first is that the fighting</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.810" end="00:10:47.160" style="s2">ability and are in the ability to win</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.670" end="00:10:48.450" style="s2">any particular fight is governed by both</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.160" end="00:10:49.710" style="s2">sort of this intrinsic ability that</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.450" end="00:10:51.540" style="s2">develops over an individual&#39;s lifetime</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.710" end="00:10:54.120" style="s2">so it&#39;s a slowly changing thing based on</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.540" end="00:10:56.130" style="s2">its experience and and someone genetics</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.120" end="00:10:58.080" style="s2">some genetic things like how big it is</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.130" end="00:11:00.240" style="s2">but that&#39;s of course also a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.080" end="00:11:02.370" style="s2">environmental and it&#39;s based on things</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.240" end="00:11:03.900" style="s2">like how a particular monkey feels on a</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.370" end="00:11:05.339" style="s2">given day or whether it&#39;s alliance</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.900" end="00:11:07.440" style="s2">partners are around and so forth so</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.339" end="00:11:09.600" style="s2">things that are temporally variable</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.440" end="00:11:10.890" style="s2">and so the reason why the monkeys need a</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.600" end="00:11:12.120" style="s2">bunch of fights to figure out the</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.890" end="00:11:14.010" style="s2">regularity is is because there are all</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.120" end="00:11:15.750" style="s2">these fluctuations so that&#39;s why this</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.010" end="00:11:17.610" style="s2">coarse graining the use of the signal is</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.750" end="00:11:20.040" style="s2">an important mechanism it gives the</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.610" end="00:11:21.960" style="s2">monkeys a reliable indicator of the sort</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.040" end="00:11:24.360" style="s2">of overall state of the relationship and</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.960" end="00:11:25.620" style="s2">and it&#39;s important distinction to that</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.360" end="00:11:27.180" style="s2">it&#39;s subordination signal not just</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.620" end="00:11:29.760" style="s2">submission because the monkeys do use</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.180" end="00:11:31.740" style="s2">similar signals in the fight context to</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.760" end="00:11:34.080" style="s2">indicate they&#39;re going to yield in this</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.740" end="00:11:35.970" style="s2">particular fight but by moving the</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.080" end="00:11:37.770" style="s2">signal outside the fight context to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.970" end="00:11:40.230" style="s2">peaceful context the monkeys are</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.770" end="00:11:41.760" style="s2">reducing the uncertainty in the receiver</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.230" end="00:11:44.130" style="s2">that the signal stands for subordination</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.760" end="00:11:46.770" style="s2">and not just submission in the immediate</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.130" end="00:11:48.900" style="s2">context so it&#39;s a really important</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.770" end="00:11:50.370" style="s2">innovation and it relates to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.900" end="00:11:51.630" style="s2">evolution of language and how we can</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.370" end="00:11:55.290" style="s2">come back to this later and how</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.630" end="00:11:56.550" style="s2">individuals learn the meaning of signals</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.290" end="00:11:58.260" style="s2">that are temporally and spatially</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.550" end="00:12:00.930" style="s2">divorced from their reference very</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.260" end="00:12:02.190" style="s2">complicated and interesting problem ok</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.930" end="00:12:04.050" style="s2">so now the monkeys have exchanged e</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.190" end="00:12:05.850" style="s2">signals and you&#39;ve got this network of</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.050" end="00:12:07.740" style="s2">these signals and you can ask where the</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.850" end="00:12:09.840" style="s2">monkeys can by looking over the network</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.740" end="00:12:12.210" style="s2">who gives signals to whom figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.840" end="00:12:14.040" style="s2">much agreement there is based on the way</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.210" end="00:12:15.990" style="s2">the signals are being exchanged about</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.040" end="00:12:17.940" style="s2">who can use for successfully so this is</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.990" end="00:12:19.830" style="s2">fundamentally a collective problem and</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.940" end="00:12:21.630" style="s2">individuals can make errors in their</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.830" end="00:12:23.490" style="s2">assessment that&#39;s very important right</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.630" end="00:12:26.400" style="s2">so the power structure that&#39;s arising</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.490" end="00:12:28.350" style="s2">out of this process can be imperfect it</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.400" end="00:12:29.610" style="s2">may not a map directly on to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.350" end="00:12:31.590" style="s2">underlying distribution of fighting</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.610" end="00:12:34.110" style="s2">abilities it&#39;s the outcome of this sort</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.590" end="00:12:36.930" style="s2">of collective assessment process that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.110" end="00:12:38.580" style="s2">super interesting so the idea is not</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.930" end="00:12:41.160" style="s2">just that we&#39;re recovering like a ground</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.580" end="00:12:42.510" style="s2">truth that&#39;s hard to see the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.160" end="00:12:44.220" style="s2">distribution of fighting abilities but</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.510" end="00:12:47.330" style="s2">we&#39;re covering a kind of collectively</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.220" end="00:12:51.000" style="s2">constructed ground truth or view of</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.330" end="00:12:52.740" style="s2">who&#39;s powerful so when in this in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.000" end="00:12:54.480" style="s2">groups that I&#39;ve studied one of the and</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.740" end="00:12:57.300" style="s2">this isn&#39;t true in every group or every</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.480" end="00:12:59.670" style="s2">macaque Society some are very different</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.300" end="00:13:01.770" style="s2">there&#39;s a the power distribution that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.670" end="00:13:04.080" style="s2">encoded in this circuit of signals is</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.770" end="00:13:06.360" style="s2">heavy tailed meaning that there are a</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.080" end="00:13:08.130" style="s2">few individuals who sit out in the tail</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.360" end="00:13:09.750" style="s2">are different from the rest of the group</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.130" end="00:13:12.630" style="s2">who are perceived by everyone more or</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.750" end="00:13:15.660" style="s2">less as disproportionately powerful so</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.630" end="00:13:19.110" style="s2">they&#39;re like our billionaires and those</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.660" end="00:13:20.460" style="s2">individuals are because they they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.110" end="00:13:21.240" style="s2">perceived this way they pay almost no</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.460" end="00:13:23.040" style="s2">cost</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.240" end="00:13:25.589" style="s2">they get no aggression response to</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.040" end="00:13:27.689" style="s2">interventions and fights and so they can</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.589" end="00:13:29.999" style="s2">perform functions like conflict</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.689" end="00:13:31.679" style="s2">management that could not be performed</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.999" end="00:13:34.259" style="s2">if the distribution were more normal or</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.679" end="00:13:35.999" style="s2">or uniform where there there are none of</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.259" end="00:13:37.829" style="s2">these billionaires so to speak right so</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.999" end="00:13:40.350" style="s2">these individuals out in the tail can do</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.829" end="00:13:42.029" style="s2">things that by virtue of being perceived</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.350" end="00:13:43.589" style="s2">so different from everybody else that</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.029" end="00:13:45.839" style="s2">they wouldn&#39;t be able to do if the</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.589" end="00:13:48.240" style="s2">distribution were different emergent</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.839" end="00:13:50.610" style="s2">function that&#39;s interesting it shows</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.240" end="00:13:52.709" style="s2">that diversity has its uses it basically</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.610" end="00:13:54.629" style="s2">produces classes that can have different</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.709" end="00:13:57.119" style="s2">roles than if everything were uniform</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.629" end="00:13:59.189" style="s2">that&#39;s another question for you one of</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.119" end="00:14:01.429" style="s2">my old favorites is there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.189" end="00:14:05.069" style="s2">arguments in cognitive science that our</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.429" end="00:14:07.379" style="s2">reasoning is roughly Bayesian if that</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.069" end="00:14:08.790" style="s2">were also true from macaque s-- was at</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.379" end="00:14:11.369" style="s2">the cash whatever monkeys these were</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.790" end="00:14:14.429" style="s2">presumably if the fight ability</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.369" end="00:14:16.619" style="s2">differential was large the number of</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.429" end="00:14:19.529" style="s2">conflicts necessary to emit a signal</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.619" end="00:14:22.259" style="s2">ought to be relatively small and when</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.529" end="00:14:24.720" style="s2">the fighting ability is closer to being</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.259" end="00:14:27.629" style="s2">similar by Bayesian analysis it will</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.720" end="00:14:29.429" style="s2">take more conflicts before you get a</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.629" end="00:14:31.350" style="s2">reliable signal is that what the data</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.429" end="00:14:33.540" style="s2">shows yeah that basically is what the</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.350" end="00:14:35.339" style="s2">data show and and also the individuals</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.540" end="00:14:38.069" style="s2">who are very similar in fighting ability</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.339" end="00:14:41.970" style="s2">they often don&#39;t signal at all and they</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.069" end="00:14:43.170" style="s2">sometimes avoid each other so you you</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.970" end="00:14:45.119" style="s2">need to fight you would need to fight</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.170" end="00:14:47.249" style="s2">more to sort of figure out what the</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.119" end="00:14:50.399" style="s2">difference is as you point out but also</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.249" end="00:14:51.869" style="s2">since with fluctuations and contextual e</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.399" end="00:14:53.220" style="s2">variable stuff like how you&#39;re feeling</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.869" end="00:14:55.740" style="s2">today or the weather or the presence of</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.220" end="00:14:57.420" style="s2">your allies would make so many fights</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.740" end="00:14:59.399" style="s2">required sometimes the strategy they</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.420" end="00:15:01.019" style="s2">adopt is just not to interact that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.399" end="00:15:03.509" style="s2">interesting that would basically point</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.019" end="00:15:04.769" style="s2">toward my old favorite roughly Bayesian</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.509" end="00:15:07.230" style="s2">right of course they don&#39;t sit there and</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.769" end="00:15:09.059" style="s2">run base theorem but they say hmm this</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.230" end="00:15:11.279" style="s2">guy is too close to me</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.059" end="00:15:13.110" style="s2">it would take a long time to prove my</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.279" end="00:15:15.389" style="s2">dominance right so not worth getting</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.110" end="00:15:17.129" style="s2">beat up that many times even if I win</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.389" end="00:15:19.019" style="s2">well Jim you raised a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.129" end="00:15:21.420" style="s2">point you say they wouldn&#39;t be sitting</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.019" end="00:15:22.920" style="s2">there competing Bayes theorem but yes</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.420" end="00:15:24.689" style="s2">consciously they&#39;re not probably</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.920" end="00:15:27.059" style="s2">considered computing Bayes theorem but</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.689" end="00:15:28.889" style="s2">their brain may be doing that that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.059" end="00:15:30.540" style="s2">you know possibility that we I think it</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.889" end="00:15:32.339" style="s2">confused about in social cases where we</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.540" end="00:15:33.660" style="s2">think that we&#39;re consciously performing</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.339" end="00:15:34.190" style="s2">the computations rather than just</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.660" end="00:15:35.750" style="s2">layering</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.190" end="00:15:38.240" style="s2">on top of competitions our brain is</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.750" end="00:15:39.769" style="s2">performing the explanation yeah that was</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.240" end="00:15:41.750" style="s2">my point is that you know I am a</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.769" end="00:15:44.389" style="s2">believer more or less that we are</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.750" end="00:15:47.089" style="s2">unconsciously running Bayes theorem in</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.389" end="00:15:48.709" style="s2">the background for roughly for a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.089" end="00:15:50.449" style="s2">things so that&#39;s why I ask the question</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.709" end="00:15:52.939" style="s2">this happens to be a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.449" end="00:15:55.009" style="s2">horizontal interesting idea that I</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.939" end="00:15:57.379" style="s2">follow up on whenever I happened to get</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.009" end="00:15:59.269" style="s2">a sniff that it might be relevant yes</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.379" end="00:16:02.060" style="s2">absolutely I agree and there&#39;s a lot 1</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.269" end="00:16:03.560" style="s2">to discuss there absolutely but we got a</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.060" end="00:16:05.480" style="s2">lot of things talked about so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.560" end="00:16:07.250" style="s2">we&#39;ll come back to that so let&#39;s talk a</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.480" end="00:16:08.899" style="s2">little bit about causality I know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.250" end="00:16:11.149" style="s2">something you&#39;re interested in it seems</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.899" end="00:16:13.790" style="s2">like every time anybody digs deeply into</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.149" end="00:16:15.769" style="s2">complexity if we&#39;re being honest we run</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.790" end="00:16:17.689" style="s2">into causality or we decide to sweep it</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.769" end="00:16:20.110" style="s2">under the rug what are your thoughts on</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.689" end="00:16:23.959" style="s2">causality that&#39;s such a big question</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.110" end="00:16:26.089" style="s2">yeah give us a big answer ok well I mean</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.959" end="00:16:27.680" style="s2">I&#39;ve thought about causality in a few</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.089" end="00:16:29.300" style="s2">particular contexts which I can mention</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.680" end="00:16:32.149" style="s2">so one of them is in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.300" end="00:16:34.129" style="s2">what&#39;s called a downward causation which</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.149" end="00:16:37.610" style="s2">is this idea that higher levels of</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.129" end="00:16:40.009" style="s2">organization somehow mysteriously impact</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.610" end="00:16:42.529" style="s2">lower levels of organization and this</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.009" end="00:16:43.759" style="s2">has been a debate because often the</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.529" end="00:16:44.959" style="s2">higher levels are thought to be sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.759" end="00:16:47.060" style="s2">statistical and it&#39;s not clear</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.959" end="00:16:49.069" style="s2">materially how this works how</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.060" end="00:16:51.560" style="s2">information can influence you know mass</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.069" end="00:16:52.819" style="s2">materials so to speak and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.560" end="00:16:55.579" style="s2">there&#39;s been a lot of nonsense around</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.819" end="00:16:57.470" style="s2">this down causation discussion and one</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.579" end="00:16:59.149" style="s2">of the things that we&#39;ve sort of hit</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.470" end="00:17:00.740" style="s2">upon in our work is that what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.149" end="00:17:02.180" style="s2">happening is it comes back to the coarse</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.740" end="00:17:04.520" style="s2">graining I mentioned that as the</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.180" end="00:17:06.770" style="s2">components of an adaptive system or</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.520" end="00:17:08.900" style="s2">estimating regularities that&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.770" end="00:17:10.909" style="s2">this coarse graining they&#39;re starting to</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.900" end="00:17:13.250" style="s2">use these coarse-grained representations</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.909" end="00:17:14.360" style="s2">rather than the environment these</p>

<p begin="00:18:56.019" end="00:19:01.779" style="s2">sudden the reason they did that is</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.590" end="00:19:04.899" style="s2">downward causation where&#39;s somebody</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.779" end="00:19:06.220" style="s2">maybe it was me decided maybe using</p>

<p begin="00:19:06.220" end="00:19:10.809" style="s2">get to later to move my hand and so that</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.649" end="00:19:12.429" style="s2">downward causation caused those atoms to</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.809" end="00:19:14.649" style="s2">move one is that a reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.429" end="00:19:16.809" style="s2">description of downward causation and if</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.649" end="00:19:19.600" style="s2">so how would you apply your thinking to</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.809" end="00:19:22.419" style="s2">that so I distinguish between simple</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.600" end="00:19:24.669" style="s2">feedback a parent downward causation and</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.419" end="00:19:28.360" style="s2">effective downward causation you know in</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.669" end="00:19:31.269" style="s2">your your atom case is closest to what I</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.360" end="00:19:33.190" style="s2">would call fee-simple feedback so there</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.269" end="00:19:35.320" style="s2">is you know some consequence because the</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.190" end="00:19:38.710" style="s2">world has changed to those atoms but the</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.320" end="00:19:40.990" style="s2">atoms are not reading anything about the</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.710" end="00:19:43.149" style="s2">world and making decisions based on that</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.990" end="00:19:45.580" style="s2">reading and the apparent downward</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.149" end="00:19:47.710" style="s2">causation you&#39;re getting tuning so the</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.580" end="00:19:49.299" style="s2">components are reading they&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.710" end="00:19:50.440" style="s2">read they&#39;re coarse graining and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.299" end="00:19:52.029" style="s2">using those coarse grains to make</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.440" end="00:19:55.179" style="s2">decisions so they&#39;re reading essentially</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.029" end="00:19:57.039" style="s2">global variables but the tuning can be</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.179" end="00:19:59.470" style="s2">partial and imprecise and then this sort</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.039" end="00:20:00.910" style="s2">of like weaker form the components I</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.470" end="00:20:02.620" style="s2">need to be tuning their base</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.910" end="00:20:03.970" style="s2">to these estimates of these of these</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.620" end="00:20:05.740" style="s2">environmental or aggregate properties</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.970" end="00:20:08.110" style="s2">and there&#39;s some kind of downward</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.740" end="00:20:09.610" style="s2">causation as soon as that happens but it</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.110" end="00:20:11.170" style="s2">doesn&#39;t demand that the estimates of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.610" end="00:20:12.580" style="s2">aggregate properties are correct or even</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.170" end="00:20:14.380" style="s2">good predictors of the system&#39;s future</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.580" end="00:20:15.520" style="s2">states there so that sort of theories</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.380" end="00:20:18.490" style="s2">for other world where could be wrong</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.520" end="00:20:20.230" style="s2">okay and then what happens is downward</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.490" end="00:20:21.760" style="s2">causation in this apparent downward</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.230" end="00:20:23.170" style="s2">causation in my view becomes effective</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.760" end="00:20:25.390" style="s2">downward causation in a much stronger</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.170" end="00:20:27.010" style="s2">form when that when the coarse grained</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.390" end="00:20:29.200" style="s2">representation or these aggregate</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.010" end="00:20:31.090" style="s2">properties are predictive of the future</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.200" end="00:20:32.350" style="s2">state of the system and another name for</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.090" end="00:20:34.600" style="s2">these variables we call them slow</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.350" end="00:20:36.040" style="s2">variables they&#39;re the aggregate</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.600" end="00:20:38.980" style="s2">properties the slow variables are robust</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.040" end="00:20:41.620" style="s2">to small perturbations the estimates of</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.980" end="00:20:43.750" style="s2">the variables are used by all components</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.620" end="00:20:46.240" style="s2">to tune decision making or most of them</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.750" end="00:20:47.590" style="s2">and the components are the individuals</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.240" end="00:20:49.570" style="s2">are mostly in agreement about these</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.590" end="00:20:51.460" style="s2">variables right so your atoms are doing</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.570" end="00:20:52.690" style="s2">none of these things and the estimates</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.460" end="00:20:54.520" style="s2">are converging so that there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.690" end="00:20:56.290" style="s2">increase in what we say we call a mutual</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.520" end="00:20:57.730" style="s2">information between the microscopic</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.290" end="00:21:00.040" style="s2">behavior and the macroscopic properties</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.730" end="00:21:01.660" style="s2">so in the atom case in the atoms case</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.040" end="00:21:03.430" style="s2">you just have simple feedback the</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.660" end="00:21:05.350" style="s2">environments change and that is you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.430" end="00:21:06.760" style="s2">has some consequences for the atoms but</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.350" end="00:21:09.010" style="s2">they really haven&#39;t had a role in that</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.760" end="00:21:10.960" style="s2">in order for it to be downward causation</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.010" end="00:21:13.030" style="s2">the components have to have a role in it</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.960" end="00:21:14.590" style="s2">they have to be perceiving or measuring</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.030" end="00:21:16.540" style="s2">some regularities and using those</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.590" end="00:21:19.060" style="s2">regularities to tune their behavior</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.540" end="00:21:21.850" style="s2">that&#39;s the critical aspect of it in my</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.060" end="00:21:23.830" style="s2">view okay let&#39;s take my example one step</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.850" end="00:21:26.410" style="s2">further maybe we can get into that realm</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.830" end="00:21:30.220" style="s2">would you describe the way the muscles</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.410" end="00:21:32.470" style="s2">behave relative to the concept in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.220" end="00:21:35.140" style="s2">head that says move your arm presumably</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.470" end="00:21:37.300" style="s2">influence by signaling over nerve</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.140" end="00:21:39.460" style="s2">systems etc is that coming closer to</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.300" end="00:21:41.440" style="s2">your idea so I don&#39;t know enough about</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.460" end="00:21:42.760" style="s2">the like neurophysiology of muscle</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.440" end="00:21:45.310" style="s2">movement to answer that question but</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.760" end="00:21:47.740" style="s2">neurons like back propagation I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.310" end="00:21:49.600" style="s2">when you have like feedback from a</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.740" end="00:21:51.550" style="s2">higher level to a lower level where the</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.600" end="00:21:53.110" style="s2">neurons have to actually make estimates</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.550" end="00:21:54.640" style="s2">of those regularities to do the back</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.110" end="00:21:56.950" style="s2">propagation mechanism would be an</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.640" end="00:21:59.470" style="s2">example so it all comes down to this if</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.950" end="00:22:00.760" style="s2">the components are estimating</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.470" end="00:22:02.610" style="s2">regularities and then using those</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.760" end="00:22:05.440" style="s2">estimates to tune their behavior and</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.610" end="00:22:07.060" style="s2">when there&#39;s a majority or a large</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.440" end="00:22:08.680" style="s2">number of them in the system doing this</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.060" end="00:22:10.390" style="s2">that&#39;s what I call it effective downward</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.680" end="00:22:11.800" style="s2">causation so that would certainly fit</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.390" end="00:22:13.570" style="s2">the case of the muscles because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.800" end="00:22:14.680" style="s2">in a constant recurrent loop with the</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.570" end="00:22:16.450" style="s2">higher levels of the brain</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.680" end="00:22:18.970" style="s2">and they&#39;re constantly adjusting as they</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.450" end="00:22:20.200" style="s2">go yeah so this doesn&#39;t require any you</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.970" end="00:22:21.700" style="s2">know it and I have to be careful</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.200" end="00:22:22.810" style="s2">obviously sophisticated cognition</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.700" end="00:22:24.490" style="s2">because actually I think there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.810" end="00:22:26.620" style="s2">of sophisticated cognition going on in</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.490" end="00:22:27.880" style="s2">lower levels but this isn&#39;t you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.620" end="00:22:30.430" style="s2">just at the individual level it</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.880" end="00:22:32.680" style="s2">certainly can describe as you you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.430" end="00:22:34.990" style="s2">muscle cells and principal and neurons</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.680" end="00:22:36.250" style="s2">it certainly seems to describe some you</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.990" end="00:22:38.920" style="s2">know of neural systems where there are</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.250" end="00:22:41.470" style="s2">these feedbacks with the neurons</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.920" end="00:22:44.290" style="s2">estimating regularities gotten the</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.470" end="00:22:47.440" style="s2">regularities in this case are what the</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.290" end="00:22:50.380" style="s2">the brain state what is the regularity</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.440" end="00:22:52.450" style="s2">that they&#39;re estimating well so for</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.380" end="00:22:54.580" style="s2">example it could be something like a</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.450" end="00:22:57.610" style="s2">brain state encoded in some timescales</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.580" end="00:22:59.680" style="s2">or you know some circuit property and a</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.610" end="00:23:01.870" style="s2">simple example would be in an experiment</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.680" end="00:23:04.210" style="s2">over the random dot basically you have</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.870" end="00:23:06.820" style="s2">dots on the screen moving left or right</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.210" end="00:23:08.050" style="s2">and there&#39;s a lot of dots and that you</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.820" end="00:23:09.880" style="s2">can control the number that are moving</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.050" end="00:23:11.740" style="s2">left to right and a subject a monkey is</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.880" end="00:23:13.750" style="s2">watching the screen it has to estimate</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.740" end="00:23:16.510" style="s2">which direction the dots are moving and</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.750" end="00:23:19.600" style="s2">so the neurons receive some input some</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.510" end="00:23:22.090" style="s2">signal that sort of based on the monkeys</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.600" end="00:23:24.130" style="s2">you know intake of this visual scene and</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.090" end="00:23:26.860" style="s2">then the man the neurons have to decide</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.130" end="00:23:31.660" style="s2">how to respond in to that signal how to</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.860" end="00:23:33.880" style="s2">fire okay and so then the state is the</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.660" end="00:23:35.050" style="s2">dots on the screen in that case the</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.880" end="00:23:36.550" style="s2">state would be yes something in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.050" end="00:23:40.000" style="s2">environment the dots on the screen and</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.550" end="00:23:41.590" style="s2">the downward causality would be the</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.000" end="00:23:44.560" style="s2">behavior of the monkey based on those</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.590" end="00:23:46.000" style="s2">dots well know so that in the case of</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.560" end="00:23:48.280" style="s2">the neurons here so the neurons then</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.000" end="00:23:49.750" style="s2">have to sort of estimate which way the</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.280" end="00:23:51.340" style="s2">Drott dots are moving and then they have</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.750" end="00:23:53.350" style="s2">an opinion about this and that in pinyin</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.340" end="00:23:56.770" style="s2">is code it encoded at the population</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.350" end="00:23:57.790" style="s2">level and an interesting question is you</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.770" end="00:23:59.290" style="s2">know if the neurons have different</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.790" end="00:24:01.060" style="s2">opinions how do they come to consensus</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.290" end="00:24:02.680" style="s2">about it and then presumably sis a</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.060" end="00:24:04.690" style="s2">little bit more complicated example that</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.680" end="00:24:06.550" style="s2">consensus view of what&#39;s going on is</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.690" end="00:24:08.380" style="s2">then passed on to another system another</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.550" end="00:24:09.760" style="s2">population of neurons in the brain that</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.380" end="00:24:11.440" style="s2">maybe control the motor output of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.760" end="00:24:13.390" style="s2">neuron and which direction of the monkey</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.440" end="00:24:14.680" style="s2">and which direction the monkey looks to</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.390" end="00:24:16.600" style="s2">indicate to the experiment or whether</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.680" end="00:24:18.160" style="s2">the dots are moving left to right so the</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.600" end="00:24:20.800" style="s2">downward causation always has to be from</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.160" end="00:24:23.470" style="s2">you know a higher organizational level</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.800" end="00:24:25.360" style="s2">to a lower organizational level and so</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.470" end="00:24:27.070" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure in that case whether you</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.360" end="00:24:30.100" style="s2">know it&#39;s occurring in the population</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.070" end="00:24:32.919" style="s2">neurons that&#39;s encoding which direction</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.100" end="00:24:35.860" style="s2">the monkey should look or or further</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.919" end="00:24:37.990" style="s2">downstream okay it&#39;s getting there it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.860" end="00:24:40.240" style="s2">still a difficult topic right they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.990" end="00:24:42.100" style="s2">still not clear in my head maybe it is</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.240" end="00:24:44.169" style="s2">in yours but I think we have to all do a</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.100" end="00:24:45.820" style="s2">little bit more thinking about this the</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.169" end="00:24:47.830" style="s2">monkey temple affords the you know a</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.820" end="00:24:49.600" style="s2">really easy version of this in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.830" end="00:24:51.190" style="s2">that the monkeys in the downward</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.600" end="00:24:52.809" style="s2">position occurs in multiple contexts so</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.190" end="00:24:54.880" style="s2">the downward causation occurs in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.809" end="00:24:56.470" style="s2">signaling context when they reference a</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.880" end="00:24:58.509" style="s2">signal the subordination signal for</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.470" end="00:25:01.809" style="s2">decision-making right so they&#39;ve made an</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.509" end="00:25:03.580" style="s2">irregularity from the fights they encode</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.809" end="00:25:05.409" style="s2">that regularity with the signal exchange</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.580" end="00:25:06.669" style="s2">they reference the signal to make</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.409" end="00:25:08.649" style="s2">decisions about how to interact in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.669" end="00:25:10.389" style="s2">future and then as the signals</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.649" end="00:25:11.679" style="s2">consolidate in the network the signal</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.389" end="00:25:13.179" style="s2">exchange consolidates in the network and</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.679" end="00:25:14.860" style="s2">they start computing the power</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.179" end="00:25:16.690" style="s2">distribution they reference the power</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.860" end="00:25:18.070" style="s2">distribution for decision-making what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.690" end="00:25:19.690" style="s2">the costs are going to pay in fights</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.070" end="00:25:21.549" style="s2">based on how they&#39;re perceived</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.690" end="00:25:24.070" style="s2">collectively in the group in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.549" end="00:25:25.269" style="s2">capacity to win a fight and so you get</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.070" end="00:25:27.190" style="s2">downward causation from the power</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.269" end="00:25:29.110" style="s2">distribution to their decisions during</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.190" end="00:25:30.129" style="s2">conflicts and and other aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.110" end="00:25:32.200" style="s2">social interaction so you have downward</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.129" end="00:25:33.549" style="s2">position there are two at two levels one</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.200" end="00:25:36.610" style="s2">at the signaling level and one in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.549" end="00:25:38.529" style="s2">power distribution okay I will call out</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.610" end="00:25:40.450" style="s2">to our audience that just written a</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.529" end="00:25:42.250" style="s2">quite accessible paper called coarse</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.450" end="00:25:44.529" style="s2">graining as a downward causation</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.250" end="00:25:46.000" style="s2">mechanism is that still a paper that</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.529" end="00:25:47.500" style="s2">you&#39;d recommend people read to get a</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.000" end="00:25:49.929" style="s2">sense of your thinking oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.500" end="00:25:52.360" style="s2">absolutely yeah I found that to be quite</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.929" end="00:25:54.879" style="s2">good actually final question on</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.360" end="00:25:56.769" style="s2">causality are you familiar with Judaea</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.879" end="00:26:00.370" style="s2">Pearl&#39;s work and his work of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.769" end="00:26:02.440" style="s2">unify probability and causality yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.370" end="00:26:04.269" style="s2">I&#39;m not an expert on you day of pearls</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.440" end="00:26:07.419" style="s2">work but yes I know his book and his</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.269" end="00:26:09.940" style="s2">papers and it related to some work that</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.419" end="00:26:12.250" style="s2">we do on robustness what&#39;s the essence</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.940" end="00:26:14.950" style="s2">of his idea about unifying probability</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.250" end="00:26:16.509" style="s2">and causality well I&#39;m not sure that I</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.950" end="00:26:17.559" style="s2">want to summarize that but I can say a</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.509" end="00:26:18.850" style="s2">little bit about causality in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.559" end="00:26:20.830" style="s2">context of robustness and some of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.850" end="00:26:21.519" style="s2">challenges that we face in measuring</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.830" end="00:26:23.649" style="s2">robustness</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.519" end="00:26:25.750" style="s2">so of course robustness is the ability</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.649" end="00:26:27.370" style="s2">of a system to maintain a function or</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.750" end="00:26:29.860" style="s2">state or structure in response to</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.370" end="00:26:31.630" style="s2">perturbations and one of the challenges</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.860" end="00:26:34.030" style="s2">in measuring robustness is that</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.630" end="00:26:35.980" style="s2">it&#39;s um often not visible until there is</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.030" end="00:26:37.210" style="s2">a perturbation and you have to be very</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.980" end="00:26:39.160" style="s2">careful about certain kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.210" end="00:26:40.630" style="s2">like for example you could do an</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.160" end="00:26:42.250" style="s2">experiment where you perturb an element</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.630" end="00:26:44.470" style="s2">of a system or component of a system and</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.250" end="00:26:46.090" style="s2">you see no change to the system and you</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.470" end="00:26:47.590" style="s2">ask yourself well why might this be is</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.090" end="00:26:51.880" style="s2">it that the systems robust this</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.590" end="00:26:53.890" style="s2">perturbation possibly or an alternative</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.880" end="00:26:56.470" style="s2">explanation is that the component that</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.890" end="00:27:00.000" style="s2">you perturbed makes a very small causal</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.470" end="00:27:02.860" style="s2">contribution to the function of interest</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.000" end="00:27:04.900" style="s2">so let&#39;s say like again I can give you</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.860" end="00:27:07.240" style="s2">an example from our monkey society or</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.900" end="00:27:09.130" style="s2">gene regulatory network and the monkey</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.240" end="00:27:11.140" style="s2">case one of the things we did is we</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.130" end="00:27:13.180" style="s2">knocked out the policing mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.140" end="00:27:14.620" style="s2">that&#39;s at this this mechanism that these</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.180" end="00:27:16.210" style="s2">individuals in the tail of the Power</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.620" end="00:27:18.070" style="s2">Distribution perform this conflict</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.210" end="00:27:21.070" style="s2">management mechanism where they break up</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.070" end="00:27:22.450" style="s2">fights and partially among other</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.070" end="00:27:24.400" style="s2">individuals in the group so they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.450" end="00:27:26.470" style="s2">take a side and they can do this by</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.400" end="00:27:28.390" style="s2">because they&#39;re perceived to be so</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.470" end="00:27:30.040" style="s2">successful are so powerful by the</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.390" end="00:27:31.450" style="s2">individuals in the group and so we</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.040" end="00:27:33.040" style="s2">knocked out this policing function by</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.450" end="00:27:35.230" style="s2">removing these individuals from the</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.040" end="00:27:36.940" style="s2">group and confining them so the removal</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.230" end="00:27:38.020" style="s2">was partial they had vocal and visual</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.940" end="00:27:40.020" style="s2">access to the group they couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.020" end="00:27:42.730" style="s2">actually perform any interventions and</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.020" end="00:27:44.980" style="s2">we had to sort of show in advance that</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.730" end="00:27:48.640" style="s2">they made a causal contribution to</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.980" end="00:27:51.070" style="s2">fights that they actually were impartial</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.640" end="00:27:52.840" style="s2">e breaking up these fights and so one of</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.070" end="00:27:56.140" style="s2">the issues in robustness as I said is is</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.840" end="00:27:57.370" style="s2">knowing whether the if you observe no</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.140" end="00:27:59.710" style="s2">change to a system as a result of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.370" end="00:28:02.530" style="s2">perturbation it&#39;s because the component</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.710" end="00:28:04.720" style="s2">you disabled or perturbed is making a</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.530" end="00:28:06.400" style="s2">causal contribution and then what you</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.720" end="00:28:08.890" style="s2">want to defend what you want to measure</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.400" end="00:28:10.390" style="s2">is an ideally if you can you want the</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.890" end="00:28:12.970" style="s2">magnitude of that causal contribution</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.390" end="00:28:14.500" style="s2">and then you want to measure what we</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.970" end="00:28:16.060" style="s2">call the exclusion dependence and this</p>

<p begin="00:28:16.060" end="00:28:21.490" style="s2">the exclusion dependence is the change</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.570" end="00:28:24.790" style="s2">to the system function or the target</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.490" end="00:28:26.830" style="s2">function in the absence when you do the</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.790" end="00:28:28.630" style="s2">perturbation so now you have the causal</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.830" end="00:28:29.950" style="s2">contribution prior to prior to the</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.630" end="00:28:31.660" style="s2">perturbation and the exclusion</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.950" end="00:28:34.690" style="s2">dependence what happens to the system</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.660" end="00:28:36.100" style="s2">when there is a perturbation and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.690" end="00:28:37.330" style="s2">the difference in these two quantities</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.100" end="00:28:40.210" style="s2">that tells you whether the system is</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.330" end="00:28:41.830" style="s2">robust so in other words you have to</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.210" end="00:28:43.090" style="s2">knock out a node that makes a causal</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.830" end="00:28:45.790" style="s2">contribution and you have to observe</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.090" end="00:28:49.060" style="s2">that when it&#39;s when it&#39;s removed</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.790" end="00:28:50.290" style="s2">the system changes and so in the cake</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.060" end="00:28:52.960" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about here you took out</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.290" end="00:28:54.640" style="s2">these highly dominant animals that were</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.960" end="00:28:56.650" style="s2">playing the policing function and when</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.640" end="00:28:59.290" style="s2">you took them out something changed and</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.650" end="00:29:01.630" style="s2">we knew in advance that they were making</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.290" end="00:29:03.940" style="s2">a causal contribution by virtue of their</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.630" end="00:29:05.230" style="s2">intervention behavior right and then yes</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.940" end="00:29:08.020" style="s2">we disabled the system of measure the</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.230" end="00:29:09.670" style="s2">exclusion dependence this is so you you</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.020" end="00:29:11.260" style="s2">take these two quantities into account</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.670" end="00:29:14.080" style="s2">so you&#39;re not measuring trivial</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.260" end="00:29:16.180" style="s2">robustness essentially gotcha I like it</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.080" end="00:29:17.650" style="s2">that&#39;s good so one thing that can happen</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.180" end="00:29:19.060" style="s2">when you do the perturbation is the</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.650" end="00:29:20.440" style="s2">system if you don&#39;t set the time scale</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.060" end="00:29:21.970" style="s2">of measurement correctly the system</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.440" end="00:29:23.830" style="s2">could rewire itself to recover the</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.970" end="00:29:26.110" style="s2">function all in an alternative way and</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.830" end="00:29:28.720" style="s2">that would also make it seem like the</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.110" end="00:29:29.770" style="s2">system had not changed but if you knew</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.720" end="00:29:32.290" style="s2">that the components that you were</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.770" end="00:29:33.880" style="s2">removing or making a causal contribution</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.290" end="00:29:35.230" style="s2">then you would question your results so</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.880" end="00:29:37.570" style="s2">again this distinction between the</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.230" end="00:29:39.640" style="s2">causal contribution prior to</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.570" end="00:29:41.950" style="s2">perturbation and then the exclusion</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.640" end="00:29:43.450" style="s2">dependence as a result of perturbation</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.950" end="00:29:45.190" style="s2">these are two different you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.450" end="00:29:48.010" style="s2">concepts and they&#39;re very important to</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.190" end="00:29:49.810" style="s2">keep in mind okay that&#39;s good since</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.010" end="00:29:51.340" style="s2">we&#39;ve been talking about slippery topics</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.810" end="00:29:53.530" style="s2">let&#39;s go into one of the slipperiest</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.340" end="00:29:56.560" style="s2">what are your thoughts about this thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.530" end="00:29:59.200" style="s2">some people call freewill and maybe how</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.560" end="00:30:01.030" style="s2">does it relate to consciousness okay so</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.200" end="00:30:03.490" style="s2">I have a some somewhat and I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.030" end="00:30:05.950" style="s2">slightly different take on this and it</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.490" end="00:30:07.510" style="s2">is definitely related to two dominant my</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.950" end="00:30:08.950" style="s2">take is definitely related to dominant</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.510" end="00:30:11.440" style="s2">ideas and neuroscience which I&#39;ll come</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.950" end="00:30:14.620" style="s2">to in a second but I basically think</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.440" end="00:30:16.150" style="s2">about freewill as the feeling and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.620" end="00:30:19.270" style="s2">very important the feeling that we can</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.150" end="00:30:21.760" style="s2">make choices and then choice is just the</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.270" end="00:30:23.230" style="s2">ability to select among alternatives due</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.760" end="00:30:25.510" style="s2">to these sort of inherent stochasticity</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.230" end="00:30:27.340" style="s2">in the world and errors and information</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.510" end="00:30:28.840" style="s2">processing which I think are common</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.340" end="00:30:31.690" style="s2">because of all that complexity that we</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.840" end="00:30:32.920" style="s2">discussed earlier so I just think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.690" end="00:30:34.780" style="s2">between choice and free will with</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.920" end="00:30:35.500" style="s2">choices is the ability to select among</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.780" end="00:30:38.140" style="s2">alternatives</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.500" end="00:30:39.400" style="s2">given the stochasticity in the world do</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.140" end="00:30:41.860" style="s2">you know a variety of different things</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.400" end="00:30:43.300" style="s2">and freewill is the feeling that we can</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.860" end="00:30:44.920" style="s2">make choices so by saying feeling it</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.300" end="00:30:46.360" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s an illusion the</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.920" end="00:30:49.330" style="s2">important point is that it&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.360" end="00:30:51.670" style="s2">emotion a feeling about how about</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.330" end="00:30:53.980" style="s2">whether we can make choices and it</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.670" end="00:30:55.750" style="s2">relates to consciousness in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.980" end="00:30:57.220" style="s2">that for me and again this is again</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.750" end="00:30:58.700" style="s2">slightly different take I think although</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.220" end="00:31:00.290" style="s2">it&#39;s been talked about for so</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.700" end="00:31:02.120" style="s2">probably since humans could talk I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.290" end="00:31:05.120" style="s2">sure someone has articulated it this way</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.120" end="00:31:07.760" style="s2">but for me consciousness is essentially</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.120" end="00:31:09.980" style="s2">the degree of access to computations in</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.760" end="00:31:11.120" style="s2">our brains at this at the system level</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.980" end="00:31:12.590" style="s2">so whether it&#39;s the whole brain of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.120" end="00:31:14.690" style="s2">whole organism or some subsystem</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.590" end="00:31:16.640" style="s2">whatever your system however you define</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.690" end="00:31:17.990" style="s2">it is however you define your system</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.640" end="00:31:19.430" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a degree of access to</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.990" end="00:31:22.460" style="s2">computations the brain at the system</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.430" end="00:31:24.470" style="s2">level captured by an effective Sirius</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.460" end="00:31:27.500" style="s2">essentially a theory for how the</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.470" end="00:31:30.260" style="s2">competition works that whether right or</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.500" end="00:31:32.900" style="s2">wrong lets the Assessor understand how</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.260" end="00:31:35.300" style="s2">the computation is being made so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.900" end="00:31:37.280" style="s2">not about an perception I&#39;ll introduce</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.300" end="00:31:38.960" style="s2">that to perception is a state of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.280" end="00:31:40.910" style="s2">world how we how we perceive the state</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.960" end="00:31:43.310" style="s2">of the world and elements in those</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.910" end="00:31:45.320" style="s2">states and you know you often hear about</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.310" end="00:31:46.580" style="s2">consciousness has this integrated thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.320" end="00:31:48.620" style="s2">and I would say that it&#39;s perception</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.580" end="00:31:50.240" style="s2">that can be integrated and consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.620" end="00:31:52.790" style="s2">really is about the degree of access to</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.240" end="00:31:55.240" style="s2">competitions in our brain so we have a</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.790" end="00:31:57.890" style="s2">less access to our motor control</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.240" end="00:32:00.920" style="s2">explaining them articulating them than</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.890" end="00:32:02.840" style="s2">we do to in principle our understanding</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.920" end="00:32:04.700" style="s2">of social interactions and one more</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.840" end="00:32:07.160" style="s2">point on ADD is that this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.700" end="00:32:09.560" style="s2">effective theory or access to these</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.160" end="00:32:10.940" style="s2">computations can be given in a variety</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.560" end="00:32:12.050" style="s2">of different ways that needn&#39;t be in</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.940" end="00:32:13.990" style="s2">natural language it could be in</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.050" end="00:32:16.730" style="s2">mathematics or it could be even</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.990" end="00:32:19.250" style="s2">expressed musically or in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.730" end="00:32:21.680" style="s2">visual imagery or texture so it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.250" end="00:32:23.090" style="s2">about an alternative representation so</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.680" end="00:32:25.370" style="s2">again consciousness is a degree of</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.090" end="00:32:27.050" style="s2">access to competitions in the brain what</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.370" end="00:32:29.240" style="s2">does it mean access to be able to see</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.050" end="00:32:31.280" style="s2">them to understand them or to use them</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.240" end="00:32:32.960" style="s2">Tabitha sort of a theory for how the</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.280" end="00:32:35.870" style="s2">computation is performed whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.960" end="00:32:37.700" style="s2">right or wrong so when you do walk down</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.870" end="00:32:39.380" style="s2">a set of steps you often have no access</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.700" end="00:32:41.540" style="s2">to the computations your brain or making</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.380" end="00:32:43.880" style="s2">is making to ensure you put your step</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.540" end="00:32:45.110" style="s2">your foot down in the right place your</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.880" end="00:32:47.000" style="s2">brain is doing that computation but you</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.110" end="00:32:48.770" style="s2">can&#39;t describe it now if you were pushed</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.000" end="00:32:50.300" style="s2">by a friend who you know you tripped or</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.770" end="00:32:51.650" style="s2">something you asked what happened you</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.300" end="00:32:53.750" style="s2">might be able to sort of make up an</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.650" end="00:32:55.250" style="s2">explanation based on logic or you sort</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.750" end="00:32:56.750" style="s2">of understanding geometry or something</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.250" end="00:32:58.790" style="s2">for how your brain perform that</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.750" end="00:33:00.380" style="s2">computation so I say our conscious</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.790" end="00:33:03.020" style="s2">understanding of many of our motor</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.380" end="00:33:04.520" style="s2">control movements is very low but</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.020" end="00:33:07.220" style="s2">perhaps we have uh we have better things</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.520" end="00:33:08.450" style="s2">for social interaction so our conscious</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.220" end="00:33:09.890" style="s2">understanding of social interaction</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.450" end="00:33:11.480" style="s2">seems to even higher although that could</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.890" end="00:33:11.810" style="s2">be that could be full you know that</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.480" end="00:33:14.330" style="s2">could be</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.810" end="00:33:16.400" style="s2">a little bit of an illusion well this</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.330" end="00:33:18.560" style="s2">seems like a pretty high level sort of</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.400" end="00:33:21.050" style="s2">evolutionary definition of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.560" end="00:33:23.750" style="s2">I mean I&#39;m thinking here the way you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.050" end="00:33:24.920" style="s2">describing it only applies to humans no</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.750" end="00:33:26.930" style="s2">I don&#39;t think so because that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.920" end="00:33:29.300" style="s2">said that the representation needn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.930" end="00:33:31.040" style="s2">in natural language okay it could be a</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.300" end="00:33:32.450" style="s2">mathematic it could mathematical it</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.040" end="00:33:34.700" style="s2">could be visual imagery could be</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.450" end="00:33:36.680" style="s2">geometric there are many alternative</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.700" end="00:33:38.450" style="s2">representations that other organisms</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.680" end="00:33:39.980" style="s2">could be using to sort of have a theory</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.450" end="00:33:43.040" style="s2">for how their brains performing these</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.980" end="00:33:45.680" style="s2">computations why do they need a theory I</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.040" end="00:33:48.110" style="s2">like to use Gerald Edelman&#39;s distinction</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.680" end="00:33:49.610" style="s2">between primary consciousness as he</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.110" end="00:33:52.190" style="s2">would describe it the kind that we are</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.610" end="00:33:54.500" style="s2">pretty confident that a dog has versus</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.190" end="00:33:56.810" style="s2">extended consciousness which is the kind</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.500" end="00:33:58.910" style="s2">that for sure humans have and maybe some</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.810" end="00:34:02.420" style="s2">of the great apes and maybe some whales</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.910" end="00:34:04.280" style="s2">and dolphins have and his definition of</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.420" end="00:34:06.950" style="s2">primary consciousness of the dog is</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.280" end="00:34:08.780" style="s2">essentially it&#39;s in its own movie of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.950" end="00:34:11.150" style="s2">world right it&#39;s in a scene and it acts</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.780" end="00:34:13.430" style="s2">and it feels that it&#39;s in this scene and</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.150" end="00:34:16.310" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t necessarily theorize about</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.430" end="00:34:18.680" style="s2">that while extended consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.310" end="00:34:21.320" style="s2">needleman&#39;s terminology does start to</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.680" end="00:34:23.960" style="s2">bring in concepts like self-awareness</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.320" end="00:34:26.090" style="s2">and the ability to theorize is your</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.960" end="00:34:28.880" style="s2">definition either of those two or</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.090" end="00:34:30.620" style="s2">something something else yeah I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.880" end="00:34:32.870" style="s2">definition of consciousness I&#39;m you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.620" end="00:34:34.880" style="s2">the ability to access those computations</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.870" end="00:34:36.950" style="s2">and have a kind of effective theory for</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.880" end="00:34:39.200" style="s2">how they&#39;re being performed is related</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.950" end="00:34:42.290" style="s2">to a omens second point but I would not</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.200" end="00:34:43.820" style="s2">restrict that to humans I think we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.290" end="00:34:46.070" style="s2">know the answer to this question yet and</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.820" end="00:34:48.680" style="s2">like I said by allowing many different</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.070" end="00:34:50.240" style="s2">types of representations then we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.680" end="00:34:51.530" style="s2">ruling this kind of consciousness out</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.240" end="00:34:52.970" style="s2">another analyst because we&#39;re focusing</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.530" end="00:34:54.920" style="s2">on the ability to do this in natural</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.970" end="00:34:56.210" style="s2">language or mathematics all right so</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.920" end="00:34:58.100" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s an important point now and</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.210" end="00:35:00.050" style="s2">neuroscience there are two big theories</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.100" end="00:35:02.630" style="s2">as I understand it for for our own</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.050" end="00:35:03.890" style="s2">consciousness and one is comes from some</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.630" end="00:35:06.320" style="s2">French I think mostly French</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.890" end="00:35:08.300" style="s2">neuroscientists and it&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.320" end="00:35:10.340" style="s2">called the global neuronal work space</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.300" end="00:35:12.020" style="s2">idea of consciousness and it&#39;s similar</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.340" end="00:35:14.510" style="s2">to what I&#39;m articulating in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.020" end="00:35:16.190" style="s2">that it suggests that there are many</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.510" end="00:35:18.380" style="s2">different processes going on in your</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.190" end="00:35:20.930" style="s2">brain and when you&#39;re conscious of</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.380" end="00:35:23.180" style="s2">something you you sort of have access to</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.930" end="00:35:23.930" style="s2">those computations in many different</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.180" end="00:35:25.819" style="s2">parts of your brain</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.930" end="00:35:27.800" style="s2">so and the way it sort of comes from</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.819" end="00:35:30.770" style="s2">this idea I think it that was originally</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.800" end="00:35:33.770" style="s2">came out of early days of AI where you</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.770" end="00:35:35.960" style="s2">have a kind of blackboard and different</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.770" end="00:35:37.790" style="s2">processes basically post information to</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.960" end="00:35:39.170" style="s2">this blackboard and when it&#39;s posted to</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.790" end="00:35:41.020" style="s2">the blackboard it&#39;s globally a bit</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.170" end="00:35:43.849" style="s2">so-called globally available information</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.020" end="00:35:45.619" style="s2">the blackboard of course is small or</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.849" end="00:35:48.170" style="s2">finite so you can&#39;t post everything</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.619" end="00:35:50.059" style="s2">there all at once and the more you can</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.170" end="00:35:52.640" style="s2">post there the more conscious you are so</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.059" end="00:35:54.410" style="s2">to speak that&#39;s that&#39;s one take on a</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.640" end="00:35:56.119" style="s2">global neuronal workspace which comes</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.410" end="00:35:57.250" style="s2">from these French neuroscientists I</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.119" end="00:36:00.050" style="s2">think it&#39;s very interesting and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.250" end="00:36:02.240" style="s2">related to what I&#39;m saying although not</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.050" end="00:36:03.619" style="s2">identical and then and then the other</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.240" end="00:36:04.880" style="s2">idea comes from like to know and</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.619" end="00:36:07.309" style="s2">Christophe coke and people like that</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.880" end="00:36:09.890" style="s2">integrated information theory which is</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.309" end="00:36:11.150" style="s2">more or less they&#39;re different takes on</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.890" end="00:36:13.550" style="s2">this but more or less the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.150" end="00:36:15.589" style="s2">consciousness is about a sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.550" end="00:36:18.170" style="s2">mechanisms that through integration and</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.589" end="00:36:21.440" style="s2">modularity allow you to represent a web</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.170" end="00:36:24.170" style="s2">of causal net of causal effects and the</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.440" end="00:36:26.750" style="s2">sort of higher you this measure called</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.170" end="00:36:29.270" style="s2">Phi is the more conscious you are so and</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.750" end="00:36:30.710" style="s2">the idea is that a higher Phi means that</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.270" end="00:36:31.940" style="s2">you can represent you have a network</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.710" end="00:36:34.910" style="s2">structure that can represent more of</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.940" end="00:36:36.500" style="s2">these puzzle interactions and so I would</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.910" end="00:36:38.390" style="s2">say that what I&#39;m saying is more it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.500" end="00:36:40.280" style="s2">closer in some respects to the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.390" end="00:36:42.260" style="s2">global neuronal workspace except I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.280" end="00:36:44.299" style="s2">also including this idea of this</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.260" end="00:36:46.280" style="s2">effective theory so that you have this</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.299" end="00:36:47.569" style="s2">theory for how your brains performing</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.280" end="00:36:49.520" style="s2">these computations which brings in a</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.569" end="00:36:52.010" style="s2">little bit of that to Nonie perspective</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.520" end="00:36:52.940" style="s2">mm-hmm right because so you&#39;ve got on</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.010" end="00:36:54.859" style="s2">the one hand this sort of global</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.940" end="00:36:56.270" style="s2">neuronal workspace that says you get</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.859" end="00:36:57.770" style="s2">access to these computations when</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.270" end="00:37:00.349" style="s2">they&#39;re posted to this blackboard this</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.770" end="00:37:01.940" style="s2">kind of global posting and then the</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.349" end="00:37:04.220" style="s2">tannot knee which is sort of emphasizing</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.940" end="00:37:06.140" style="s2">this web of causal interactions that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.220" end="00:37:07.670" style="s2">meaning possible by this particular type</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.140" end="00:37:09.500" style="s2">of network structure where this Phi is</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.670" end="00:37:10.820" style="s2">maximized</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.500" end="00:37:12.770" style="s2">yep yeah I would add a little bit to</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.820" end="00:37:14.480" style="s2">that which is the global workspace</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.770" end="00:37:17.180" style="s2">theory was actually I think originally</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.480" end="00:37:19.280" style="s2">fully articulated by Bernard Bars who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.180" end="00:37:22.160" style="s2">an American though it is being pushed</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.280" end="00:37:25.160" style="s2">today by frenchman like the Haney etc</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.160" end="00:37:27.290" style="s2">exactly that&#39;s right Barzini and change</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.160" end="00:37:29.240" style="s2">you I think&#39;s the same yeah I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.290" end="00:37:31.160" style="s2">that one in my own work in consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.240" end="00:37:33.740" style="s2">I basically follow bars with some</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.160" end="00:37:35.900" style="s2">extensions and corrections and certainly</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.740" end="00:37:37.310" style="s2">we have two noni and coke with the</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.900" end="00:37:39.440" style="s2">integrated information there&#39;s a third</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.310" end="00:37:41.570" style="s2">real important one which is the more</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.440" end="00:37:44.270" style="s2">bodily emotional theories of people like</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.570" end="00:37:46.490" style="s2">Antonio Damasio one of the books that I</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.270" end="00:37:47.690" style="s2">wrongly recommend to people if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.490" end="00:37:50.030" style="s2">interested in understanding his</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.690" end="00:37:52.880" style="s2">perspective is the feeling of what</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.030" end="00:37:54.770" style="s2">happens yeah he argues that the seat of</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.880" end="00:37:57.020" style="s2">consciousness is not the cortex there</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.770" end="00:37:58.640" style="s2">the thalamocortical connections or in</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.020" end="00:38:01.070" style="s2">perception or anywhere else but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.640" end="00:38:02.810" style="s2">deep in the brain stem in the feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.070" end="00:38:04.550" style="s2">having a body and that that is where</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.810" end="00:38:06.470" style="s2">consciousness comes from so he would</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.550" end="00:38:08.420" style="s2">argue consciousness goes way way way</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.470" end="00:38:11.119" style="s2">back evolutionary I would say those are</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.420" end="00:38:12.590" style="s2">the three differing arguments from the</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.119" end="00:38:13.760" style="s2">neural science community and then of</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.590" end="00:38:15.619" style="s2">course we have other arguments from</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.760" end="00:38:17.119" style="s2">people like David Chalmers about the</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.619" end="00:38:18.890" style="s2">hard problem which we don&#39;t really need</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.119" end="00:38:21.560" style="s2">to get into today because that&#39;s above</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.890" end="00:38:23.930" style="s2">our pay grade I think what we&#39;ve covered</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.560" end="00:38:25.760" style="s2">actually tackles almost hard-hard from</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.930" end="00:38:26.960" style="s2">exactly that I mean so I don&#39;t I would</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.760" end="00:38:28.820" style="s2">add to this is so I don&#39;t I don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.960" end="00:38:30.890" style="s2">see that there&#39;s a hard and an easy</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.820" end="00:38:33.800" style="s2">problem as Chalmers articulated I think</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.890" end="00:38:35.869" style="s2">that that&#39;s false and that the the the</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.800" end="00:38:37.250" style="s2">free will thing that I the point I made</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.869" end="00:38:39.040" style="s2">earlier that free will is a feeling that</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.250" end="00:38:41.810" style="s2">we can make choices is related to the</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.040" end="00:38:44.150" style="s2">embodiment points you&#39;re making and this</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.810" end="00:38:46.099" style="s2">mind brain distinction comes back to the</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.150" end="00:38:48.020" style="s2">coarse graining and the global neuronal</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.099" end="00:38:49.580" style="s2">works based points which is that by</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.020" end="00:38:50.960" style="s2">coarse graining you come out coming out</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.580" end="00:38:52.640" style="s2">with these sort of summary statistics</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.960" end="00:38:54.950" style="s2">global variables essentially that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.640" end="00:38:56.599" style="s2">posting to this blackboard and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.950" end="00:38:58.250" style="s2">where you get the notion of mind is</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.599" end="00:38:59.480" style="s2">essentially that the summary statistics</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.250" end="00:39:01.070" style="s2">are coarse-grained representations of</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.480" end="00:39:04.330" style="s2">neural dynamics the weak problem of</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.070" end="00:39:07.190" style="s2">Chalmers that we have some access to</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.330" end="00:39:08.720" style="s2">secondarily and when we have that access</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.190" end="00:39:10.490" style="s2">that&#39;s what I call consciousness and so</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.720" end="00:39:11.869" style="s2">like I said it I&#39;m not gonna restrict it</p>

<p begin="00:39:11.869" end="00:39:15.380" style="s2">it to those representations being stated</p>

<p begin="00:39:33.580" end="00:39:38.500" style="s2">believe in that again it&#39;s like the</p>

<p begin="00:39:38.500" end="00:39:40.750" style="s2">my take as well even though I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.030" end="00:39:43.090" style="s2">prove it</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.750" end="00:39:45.490" style="s2">my intuition having been working in this</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.090" end="00:39:47.140" style="s2">space now for eight years is that there</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.490" end="00:39:49.210" style="s2">is no hard problem you know guys like</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.140" end="00:39:49.780" style="s2">Daniel Dennett would agree with that as</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.210" end="00:39:51.940" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.780" end="00:39:54.280" style="s2">but we haven&#39;t quite been able to figure</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.940" end="00:39:55.930" style="s2">out exactly how to articulate it though</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.280" end="00:39:57.820" style="s2">I like your approach which is we think</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.930" end="00:39:59.710" style="s2">about things like free will let me try</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.820" end="00:40:01.570" style="s2">to put your words into some different</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.710" end="00:40:04.360" style="s2">words and tell me if I get it or not is</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.570" end="00:40:06.850" style="s2">that if we think of free will as the</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.360" end="00:40:08.650" style="s2">ability to make choice within a certain</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.850" end="00:40:11.860" style="s2">level of abstraction or what you would</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.650" end="00:40:13.360" style="s2">call coarse graining then we can say</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.860" end="00:40:15.760" style="s2">that we do have free will</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.360" end="00:40:18.460" style="s2">even though I&#39;m currently reading Brian</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.760" end="00:40:19.960" style="s2">Greene&#39;s new book you know explanation</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.460" end="00:40:22.660" style="s2">of everything about science from the Big</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.960" end="00:40:24.130" style="s2">Bang to Beethoven essentially and he</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.660" end="00:40:26.140" style="s2">argues there&#39;s no such thing as free</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.130" end="00:40:28.090" style="s2">well it&#39;s all fundamentally reductionist</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.140" end="00:40:29.800" style="s2">physics all the way down but your</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.090" end="00:40:32.560" style="s2">analysis would say that it at the right</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.800" end="00:40:34.000" style="s2">level of coarse graining than to degree</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.560" end="00:40:35.230" style="s2">we have choices within that coarse</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.000" end="00:40:37.630" style="s2">graining then we have freewill</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.230" end="00:40:39.760" style="s2">yes I think that&#39;s basically what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.630" end="00:40:41.740" style="s2">saying I would I would highlight two</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.760" end="00:40:43.420" style="s2">things that one our choice space could</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.740" end="00:40:46.090" style="s2">be larger than we imagined or understand</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.420" end="00:40:47.650" style="s2">and so are we might in that case our</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.090" end="00:40:49.120" style="s2">feeling of freewill is less than it</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.650" end="00:40:51.280" style="s2">could be if we fully understood our</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.120" end="00:40:53.470" style="s2">choice space that&#39;s one sort of nuance</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.280" end="00:40:55.540" style="s2">and the other is that yes how you</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.470" end="00:40:58.210" style="s2">coarse-grain will impact how large</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.540" end="00:40:59.500" style="s2">perceive that choice space to be now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.210" end="00:41:03.150" style="s2">going to branch off here something not</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.500" end="00:41:07.300" style="s2">in my notes so could something like</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.150" end="00:41:09.970" style="s2">meditation affect our ability to access</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.300" end="00:41:12.580" style="s2">our free will or change how we feel it</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.970" end="00:41:14.590" style="s2">or experience it yeah I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.580" end="00:41:17.410" style="s2">there are definitely ways that we could</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.590" end="00:41:19.180" style="s2">so let&#39;s say our you know we&#39;re highly</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.410" end="00:41:21.580" style="s2">stressed and so we don&#39;t perceive the</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.180" end="00:41:23.320" style="s2">full choice space we think there are</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.580" end="00:41:26.980" style="s2">certain options that are close to us but</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.320" end="00:41:28.630" style="s2">they&#39;re not actually and by taking</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.980" end="00:41:30.100" style="s2">making certain interventions meditation</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.630" end="00:41:32.710" style="s2">might be one exercise could be another</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.100" end="00:41:33.590" style="s2">where we calm our brains or change our</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.710" end="00:41:36.680" style="s2">attentional neck</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.590" end="00:41:37.970" style="s2">or you know quiet our responses we might</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.680" end="00:41:39.680" style="s2">be able to perceive a larger choice</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.970" end="00:41:41.720" style="s2">space and then increase that feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.680" end="00:41:44.350" style="s2">being able to make choices and then that</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.720" end="00:41:46.250" style="s2">way so to speak increase our freewill</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.350" end="00:41:48.530" style="s2">possibly I mean that&#39;s really special</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.250" end="00:41:50.660" style="s2">rating and it&#39;s fun it&#39;s a fun thing to</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.530" end="00:41:52.970" style="s2">think about people who listen to the</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.660" end="00:41:55.670" style="s2">show regularly know that I&#39;m fairly</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.970" end="00:41:58.190" style="s2">skeptical about spirituality and I call</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.670" end="00:41:59.450" style="s2">it the S word and I&#39;ve had some very</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.190" end="00:42:01.610" style="s2">interesting conversations with people</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.450" end="00:42:03.350" style="s2">who are practitioners of what they call</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.610" end="00:42:04.610" style="s2">spirituality I will say I have learned</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.350" end="00:42:06.740" style="s2">from them and I hope they have learned</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.610" end="00:42:08.420" style="s2">from me next time I run into one of</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.740" end="00:42:11.000" style="s2">these discussions I&#39;m going to ask them</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.420" end="00:42:13.960" style="s2">all right I&#39;ll present your concept of</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.000" end="00:42:16.160" style="s2">free will and I&#39;d say explain to me how</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.960" end="00:42:18.710" style="s2">contemplative practice or other forms of</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.160" end="00:42:21.260" style="s2">spirituality may or may not you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.710" end="00:42:23.390" style="s2">expand or refine or improve this concept</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.260" end="00:42:25.370" style="s2">of free will so interesting so I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.390" end="00:42:27.230" style="s2">to move along here a little bit you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.370" end="00:42:29.750" style="s2">co-author with a bunch of other my</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.230" end="00:42:32.570" style="s2">favorite complexity science folks on a</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.750" end="00:42:35.780" style="s2">paper titled the challenges and scope of</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.570" end="00:42:37.640" style="s2">theoretical biology and it&#39;s a paper I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.780" end="00:42:39.860" style="s2">also recommend to our listeners despite</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.640" end="00:42:42.290" style="s2">its incredibly deep ideas</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.860" end="00:42:45.080" style="s2">it is quite accessible and as I recall</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.290" end="00:42:47.390" style="s2">has no math at all I know it&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.080" end="00:42:49.160" style="s2">topic could you tell us what you can</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.390" end="00:42:50.330" style="s2">about it yeah so I mean this is</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.160" end="00:42:51.710" style="s2">obviously a huge point of interest at</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.330" end="00:42:53.420" style="s2">the Sante fans it&#39;s you law like</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.710" end="00:42:56.240" style="s2">behavior and adaptive systems and and</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.420" end="00:42:57.770" style="s2">there seem to be you know lots of</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.240" end="00:43:00.320" style="s2">regularities and low like phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.770" end="00:43:02.180" style="s2">physical systems and we question one</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.320" end="00:43:04.970" style="s2">question is why there there aren&#39;t as</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.180" end="00:43:07.970" style="s2">many or why we haven&#39;t identified as</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.970" end="00:43:10.310" style="s2">many or as often laws in biology in</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.970" end="00:43:12.200" style="s2">adaptive systems and and so this papers</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.310" end="00:43:14.450" style="s2">sort of an attempt to I&#39;m addressed that</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.200" end="00:43:17.540" style="s2">and this is a big theme in my work in</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.450" end="00:43:19.670" style="s2">fact so I guess I would step back and</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.540" end="00:43:21.800" style="s2">start with this observation that energy</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.670" end="00:43:23.540" style="s2">energy was sort of at the core of 20th</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.800" end="00:43:26.270" style="s2">century science and and maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.540" end="00:43:28.400" style="s2">proceedings say 300 years and the focus</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.270" end="00:43:29.720" style="s2">on energy in sort of in physics of</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.400" end="00:43:32.000" style="s2">course culminated with the splitting of</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.720" end="00:43:33.860" style="s2">the atom during Manhattan Project and in</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.000" end="00:43:35.840" style="s2">biology for the most part the focus has</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.860" end="00:43:37.820" style="s2">been on this is a really big picture to</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.840" end="00:43:39.950" style="s2">sort of get into this difference of you</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.820" end="00:43:42.710" style="s2">know why I seem to be fewer laws analogy</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.950" end="00:43:44.990" style="s2">in biology also for the most for the</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.710" end="00:43:46.490" style="s2">20th century and before the emphasis has</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.990" end="00:43:47.800" style="s2">been on energy how organisms get across</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.490" end="00:43:49.609" style="s2">and convert it into offspring</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.800" end="00:43:51.200" style="s2">information is always recognized as</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.609" end="00:43:53.510" style="s2">important right so you&#39;ve got wheeler</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.200" end="00:43:55.280" style="s2">for example in arguing that it&#39;s in fact</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.510" end="00:43:58.339" style="s2">perceived matter and that lovely paper</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.280" end="00:44:00.349" style="s2">he wrote and then jeans you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.339" end="00:44:02.270" style="s2">connecting entropy the number of options</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.349" end="00:44:05.329" style="s2">available to a system to statistical</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.270" end="00:44:06.319" style="s2">mechanics information theory so and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.329" end="00:44:08.569" style="s2">you&#39;ve got people like Seth Lloyd</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.319" end="00:44:11.000" style="s2">writing books about universe itself</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.569" end="00:44:12.920" style="s2">being a computer but I say despite this</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.000" end="00:44:16.010" style="s2">this the overwhelming focus has been on</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.920" end="00:44:18.020" style="s2">energy and I&#39;ve argued and we sort of</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.010" end="00:44:19.849" style="s2">dealing with this in that paper to make</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.020" end="00:44:22.460" style="s2">products and biology information has to</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.849" end="00:44:24.109" style="s2">be more central and to sort of see why</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.460" end="00:44:25.220" style="s2">that&#39;s the case it&#39;s sort of useful to</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.109" end="00:44:26.359" style="s2">step back and think about some</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.220" end="00:44:28.550" style="s2">distinctions between physical and</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.359" end="00:44:30.560" style="s2">biology biological systems so physics</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.550" end="00:44:31.790" style="s2">for the most part you know dominated by</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.560" end="00:44:33.950" style="s2">concepts like pressure temperature and</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.790" end="00:44:36.710" style="s2">entropy that emerge to fairly simple</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.950" end="00:44:38.150" style="s2">collective interactions and kind of they</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.710" end="00:44:39.380" style="s2">give these collective interactions to</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.150" end="00:44:41.750" style="s2">give sort of deep insight into the</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.380" end="00:44:43.430" style="s2">behavior of the physical universe right</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.750" end="00:44:44.900" style="s2">and so physical particles have</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.430" end="00:44:46.190" style="s2">properties like position velocity mass</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.900" end="00:44:47.569" style="s2">and their collective property is the</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.190" end="00:44:49.369" style="s2">macroscopic world of temperature and</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.569" end="00:44:51.020" style="s2">pressure and so forth and you get</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.369" end="00:44:52.400" style="s2">thermodynamics it&#39;s kind of theory for a</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.020" end="00:44:54.020" style="s2">relationship among the microscopic or</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.400" end="00:44:56.270" style="s2">aggregate variables at equilibrium and</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.020" end="00:44:58.069" style="s2">you get these regularities then like the</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.270" end="00:44:59.510" style="s2">ideal gas law which is an equation of</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.069" end="00:45:01.849" style="s2">state that tells you the amount of gas</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.510" end="00:45:03.800" style="s2">is to turn by its pressure volume and</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.849" end="00:45:05.780" style="s2">temperature and so you get this these</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.800" end="00:45:08.930" style="s2">regularities or laws like the ideal gas</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.780" end="00:45:11.180" style="s2">law now biology also makes use of</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.930" end="00:45:13.130" style="s2">comparable collective concepts like as</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.180" end="00:45:15.109" style="s2">physics does but in biology these are</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.130" end="00:45:16.310" style="s2">concepts like metabolism conflict</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.109" end="00:45:18.260" style="s2">management and robust as some of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.310" end="00:45:19.609" style="s2">things we&#39;ve already mentioned and in</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.260" end="00:45:21.440" style="s2">contrasts of physical systems these are</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.609" end="00:45:23.510" style="s2">very functional properties with</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.440" end="00:45:24.589" style="s2">consequences to downward causation and</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.510" end="00:45:26.710" style="s2">so forth to the system and its</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.589" end="00:45:28.730" style="s2">components so physics is essentially</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.710" end="00:45:30.440" style="s2">producing and we&#39;re gonna get to the to</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.730" end="00:45:32.210" style="s2">the to the close point in just a second</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.440" end="00:45:33.530" style="s2">physics is essentially producing orders</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.210" end="00:45:35.300" style="s2">of the minimization of energy and</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.530" end="00:45:38.089" style="s2">biologies doing this with the addition</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.300" end="00:45:39.530" style="s2">of information processing and now what</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.089" end="00:45:41.630" style="s2">are the states we look around biology we</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.530" end="00:45:42.920" style="s2">see not a lot of laws but water states</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.630" end="00:45:45.609" style="s2">are ubiquitous there&#39;s law like</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.920" end="00:45:48.410" style="s2">relations it seems all over the place</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.609" end="00:45:49.700" style="s2">but why adaptive systems have this extra</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.410" end="00:45:52.369" style="s2">step of information processing and</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.700" end="00:45:54.140" style="s2">whether it&#39;s the reason why we see fewer</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.369" end="00:45:57.560" style="s2">laws and biology are these big open</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.140" end="00:45:58.880" style="s2">questions that people ask it SFI so one</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.560" end="00:46:01.440" style="s2">of the things we want to understand is</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.880" end="00:46:05.339" style="s2">what do what does information processing</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.440" end="00:46:06.690" style="s2">do in biology and a nice sort of entry</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.339" end="00:46:08.460" style="s2">point into this is to think of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.690" end="00:46:10.589" style="s2">scaling work of Jeffery West and his</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.460" end="00:46:12.569" style="s2">colleagues Jim Brown and Brian quest and</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.589" end="00:46:14.910" style="s2">others right so Kleiber of course</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.569" end="00:46:16.980" style="s2">observed a long time ago 100 years or so</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.910" end="00:46:18.810" style="s2">this robust statistical relationship</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.980" end="00:46:20.910" style="s2">between mass and metabolic rate that</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.810" end="00:46:22.530" style="s2">such a mass scale since 3/4 power right</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.910" end="00:46:24.569" style="s2">so this is this is one of the laws we</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.530" end="00:46:25.800" style="s2">have in biology and then Geoffrey and</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.569" end="00:46:27.510" style="s2">his colleagues came along and derived</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.800" end="00:46:30.690" style="s2">this from first principles for axioms</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.510" end="00:46:31.980" style="s2">about how these axioms capture the</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.690" end="00:46:33.630" style="s2">energetic constraints it&#39;s sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.980" end="00:46:35.490" style="s2">how energy is distributed through the</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.630" end="00:46:38.130" style="s2">circulatory system of mammals so we get</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.490" end="00:46:39.480" style="s2">this law but it&#39;s a law for an example</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.130" end="00:46:42.510" style="s2">where there&#39;s a strong energetic</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.480" end="00:46:44.339" style="s2">constraint now we also like a set of</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.510" end="00:46:47.400" style="s2">information processing all over biology</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.339" end="00:46:49.140" style="s2">and so Geoffrey and and crew sort of</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.400" end="00:46:51.030" style="s2">shifted to cities and they started</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.140" end="00:46:52.740" style="s2">asking about scaling in cities and</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.030" end="00:46:54.869" style="s2">they&#39;re asking they&#39;re about questions</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.740" end="00:46:56.579" style="s2">like how does population size scale with</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.869" end="00:46:56.970" style="s2">crime or eating patent generation and so</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.579" end="00:46:58.440" style="s2">forth</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.970" end="00:47:00.210" style="s2">and one of the interesting things they</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.440" end="00:47:01.950" style="s2">find is that for a lot of these city</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.210" end="00:47:03.780" style="s2">variables the scaling is super linear</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.950" end="00:47:05.730" style="s2">that means you know it&#39;s an increasing</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.780" end="00:47:08.430" style="s2">return to scale in contrast to the</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.730" end="00:47:09.839" style="s2">sublinear 3/4 scale power 3/4 scaling</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.430" end="00:47:12.300" style="s2">that was found for the metabolic systems</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.839" end="00:47:14.280" style="s2">so so here&#39;s an interesting observation</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.300" end="00:47:15.990" style="s2">in these systems where information</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.280" end="00:47:18.210" style="s2">processing is important that team to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.990" end="00:47:20.460" style="s2">collective you get super linear scaling</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.210" end="00:47:22.200" style="s2">and in the strongly constrained</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.460" end="00:47:25.050" style="s2">energetically constrained systems you</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.200" end="00:47:26.730" style="s2">get this sort of sub linear scaling so</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.050" end="00:47:29.010" style="s2">there does seem to be this difference or</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.730" end="00:47:30.359" style="s2">this implication of having information</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.010" end="00:47:33.030" style="s2">and collective effects in your system</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.359" end="00:47:34.950" style="s2">and then sort of the last point I want</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.030" end="00:47:38.069" style="s2">to make is that this brings us to the</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.950" end="00:47:39.390" style="s2">collective computation so and back to</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.069" end="00:47:40.740" style="s2">our point about complexity at the</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.390" end="00:47:42.240" style="s2">beginning of this talk when you asked</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.740" end="00:47:44.550" style="s2">about the information bottleneck and</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.240" end="00:47:46.619" style="s2">macroscopic expansion so what does</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.550" end="00:47:48.420" style="s2">information do so information processing</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.619" end="00:47:50.430" style="s2">do the system well my suggestion is that</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.420" end="00:47:52.710" style="s2">a lot of information processing is</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.430" end="00:47:54.420" style="s2">erroneous the components are making</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.710" end="00:47:56.420" style="s2">mistakes or have restricted</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.420" end="00:47:58.859" style="s2">computational capacity so they cannot</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.420" end="00:48:00.150" style="s2">perfectly estimate or optimally estimate</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.859" end="00:48:02.609" style="s2">regularities in their environment so</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.150" end="00:48:04.800" style="s2">what do they do instead of doing it just</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.609" end="00:48:06.180" style="s2">on their own they collectively compute</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.800" end="00:48:08.609" style="s2">the regularities they collectively</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.180" end="00:48:10.200" style="s2">coarse-grain and in this way they sort</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.609" end="00:48:11.760" style="s2">of solve this problem that information</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.200" end="00:48:14.550" style="s2">processing introduces and the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.760" end="00:48:15.160" style="s2">subjectivity and so the reason why we</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.550" end="00:48:16.960" style="s2">haven&#39;t seen</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.160" end="00:48:19.360" style="s2">or identified a lot of laws and biology</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.960" end="00:48:21.250" style="s2">yet it&#39;s because we need in order to see</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.360" end="00:48:23.560" style="s2">those laws we need to understand how the</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.250" end="00:48:26.140" style="s2">system is processing information through</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.560" end="00:48:27.520" style="s2">collective computation and once we have</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.140" end="00:48:29.260" style="s2">that we&#39;ll have a better idea of what</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.520" end="00:48:31.720" style="s2">the relevant macroscopic variables are</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.260" end="00:48:33.820" style="s2">all right so the basic idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.720" end="00:48:35.710" style="s2">because the system is performing these</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.820" end="00:48:37.150" style="s2">computations without taking the system&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.710" end="00:48:38.950" style="s2">point of view we will never see the laws</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.150" end="00:48:41.950" style="s2">and in physical systems that is</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.950" end="00:48:43.240" style="s2">absolutely not required could you expand</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.950" end="00:48:44.710" style="s2">that just a little bit the difference</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.240" end="00:48:46.450" style="s2">between physical systems and the</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.710" end="00:48:49.210" style="s2">biological I didn&#39;t quite get that last</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.450" end="00:48:50.650" style="s2">sentence okay right so the microscopic</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.210" end="00:48:51.640" style="s2">world is complex we&#39;ve sort of</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.650" end="00:48:54.310" style="s2">established at the beginning this</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.640" end="00:48:56.080" style="s2">conversation so how do components get</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.310" end="00:48:57.360" style="s2">regularities so they doing information</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.080" end="00:48:59.200" style="s2">processing they&#39;re estimating</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.360" end="00:49:02.170" style="s2">regularities despite all of that</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.200" end="00:49:03.250" style="s2">complexity yet they&#39;re error-prone so</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.170" end="00:49:06.820" style="s2">they don&#39;t make these estimates</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.250" end="00:49:09.250" style="s2">perfectly so information processing in</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.820" end="00:49:11.130" style="s2">adaptive systems is introducing</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.250" end="00:49:13.750" style="s2">subjectivity it&#39;s introducing</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.130" end="00:49:15.070" style="s2">idiosyncratic views for how the world</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.750" end="00:49:17.320" style="s2">works because of the errors that</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.070" end="00:49:19.450" style="s2">components are making and so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.320" end="00:49:20.860" style="s2">arguments that we make in our work is</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.450" end="00:49:22.750" style="s2">that one way to overcome this</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.860" end="00:49:25.600" style="s2">subjectivity and produce ordered States</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.750" end="00:49:27.100" style="s2">is by collectively computing pooling our</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.600" end="00:49:30.910" style="s2">opinions of how the world works</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.100" end="00:49:33.210" style="s2">and getting the consensus view now there</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.910" end="00:49:35.380" style="s2">are two consequences of that one is that</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.210" end="00:49:37.390" style="s2">we might get a better picture for how</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.380" end="00:49:38.920" style="s2">the world works but another is that</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.390" end="00:49:40.660" style="s2">sometimes we&#39;re not recovering the</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.920" end="00:49:42.160" style="s2">ground truth if there is one out in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.660" end="00:49:43.750" style="s2">environment that is like something like</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.160" end="00:49:45.880" style="s2">the height of the Eiffel Tower that over</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.750" end="00:49:49.180" style="s2">which we have no control but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.880" end="00:49:52.210" style="s2">computing a social regularity like power</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.180" end="00:49:54.010" style="s2">so my point when I was going through the</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.210" end="00:49:55.630" style="s2">monkey example earlier about the power</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.010" end="00:49:57.910" style="s2">being kind of a the outcome of a</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.630" end="00:50:00.760" style="s2">collective perception is that the view</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.910" end="00:50:03.250" style="s2">of power is in some sense being created</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.760" end="00:50:06.190" style="s2">as the system moves through its the</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.250" end="00:50:08.260" style="s2">dynamics so it&#39;s it&#39;s collective and so</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.190" end="00:50:10.120" style="s2">in that sense the power distribution is</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.260" end="00:50:11.650" style="s2">not a ground it&#39;s not you&#39;re not</p>

<p begin="00:50:15.190" end="00:50:19.420" style="s2">processing so my point is that in</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.590" end="00:50:21.010" style="s2">physical systems where there is much</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.420" end="00:50:23.410" style="s2">less of this information processing and</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.010" end="00:50:26.170" style="s2">it&#39;s not as error prone or are prone at</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.410" end="00:50:28.150" style="s2">all the law like regularities are easy</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.170" end="00:50:28.780" style="s2">to observe from the observers point of</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.150" end="00:50:31.780" style="s2">view</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.780" end="00:50:33.250" style="s2">but that in adaptive systems law-like</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.780" end="00:50:34.840" style="s2">regularities are a little bit hidden</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.250" end="00:50:36.400" style="s2">because in order to see them you have to</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.840" end="00:50:38.440" style="s2">understand how the system perceives the</p>

<p begin="00:50:43.480" end="00:50:46.390" style="s2">that the system through the components</p>

<p begin="00:50:50.290" end="00:50:54.310" style="s2">right so these things are not based on</p>

<p begin="00:50:54.310" end="00:50:57.850" style="s2">they&#39;re based on the collective dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.780" end="00:51:00.010" style="s2">or an outcome or information processing</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.850" end="00:51:01.900" style="s2">the collective dynamics and one could</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.010" end="00:51:03.370" style="s2">say perhaps you have to even take a</p>

<p begin="00:51:03.370" end="00:51:07.570" style="s2">perspective of a component is that</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.990" end="00:51:09.880" style="s2">somehow make sense exactly you have to</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.570" end="00:51:11.200" style="s2">try and figure out how the components</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.880" end="00:51:12.670" style="s2">perceive the world what their theories</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.200" end="00:51:14.320" style="s2">are for the how the world works and how</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.670" end="00:51:17.050" style="s2">those theories combine to briefs their</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.320" end="00:51:18.820" style="s2">social structure and then and you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.050" end="00:51:20.920" style="s2">their their their collective enterprise</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.820" end="00:51:22.360" style="s2">you have to take their point of view and</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.920" end="00:51:25.630" style="s2">I think once we start doing this more</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.360" end="00:51:27.460" style="s2">seriously we will identify laws and</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.630" end="00:51:30.160" style="s2">adaptive systems another way of putting</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.460" end="00:51:31.990" style="s2">this is that there are not as many to</p>

<p begin="00:51:50.890" end="00:51:54.520" style="s2">in some sense are the ones that have you</p>

<p begin="00:52:15.580" end="00:52:19.870" style="s2">it ring for me let&#39;s move on now to</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.310" end="00:52:22.030" style="s2">another topic it&#39;s actually from the</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.870" end="00:52:24.520" style="s2">same paper ever quote how much of</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.030" end="00:52:27.280" style="s2">biological nature can be predicted from</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.520" end="00:52:31.180" style="s2">basic physical law this question is</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.280" end="00:52:33.130" style="s2">simple to answer effectively zero this</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.180" end="00:52:35.290" style="s2">connects directly with the thorny</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.130" end="00:52:37.780" style="s2">question of emergence so we&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.290" end="00:52:39.280" style="s2">to our another slippery topic here what</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.780" end="00:52:41.130" style="s2">are your thoughts about the thorny</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.280" end="00:52:44.190" style="s2">question of emergent</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.130" end="00:52:45.690" style="s2">you know my you&#39;re gonna detect a theme</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.190" end="00:52:48.539" style="s2">here but I believe all of these things</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.690" end="00:52:52.170" style="s2">freewill consciousness and emergence are</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.539" end="00:52:55.259" style="s2">overly mystified the mind brain problem</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.170" end="00:52:56.579" style="s2">right I think comes down to just being a</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.259" end="00:53:00.630" style="s2">little bit more materialist about this</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.579" end="00:53:03.269" style="s2">so emergence for me is when you have a</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.630" end="00:53:05.069" style="s2">reduction in uncertainty and generally a</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.269" end="00:53:06.799" style="s2">slow variables is a coarse-grained</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.069" end="00:53:09.359" style="s2">variable is what&#39;s giving you that so</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.799" end="00:53:11.519" style="s2">again like if you take my macroscopic</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.359" end="00:53:14.099" style="s2">expansion thing in the power example</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.519" end="00:53:15.839" style="s2">which fairly easy to think through you</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.099" end="00:53:17.059" style="s2">get this distribution of power that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.839" end="00:53:18.930" style="s2">sort of encoded in this network</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.059" end="00:53:20.339" style="s2">typically with emergency we think</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.930" end="00:53:22.950" style="s2">there&#39;s some kind of non-linearity it</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.339" end="00:53:24.269" style="s2">makes it hard to predict but that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.950" end="00:53:26.759" style="s2">the only thing so in the in the power</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.269" end="00:53:28.349" style="s2">case the algorithms that are used to</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.759" end="00:53:30.569" style="s2">quantify the power structure that sort</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.349" end="00:53:32.220" style="s2">of tell you how it&#39;s encoded in the net</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.569" end="00:53:33.450" style="s2">the network or circuit of signaling</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.220" end="00:53:36.390" style="s2">interactions there are some</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.450" end="00:53:37.950" style="s2">nonlinearities in those we think so the</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.390" end="00:53:39.480" style="s2">power distribution cell has a little</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.950" end="00:53:41.220" style="s2">property of emergence to it but the real</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.480" end="00:53:43.109" style="s2">emergence comes in functional</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.220" end="00:53:44.700" style="s2">consequences of having this heavy-tailed</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.109" end="00:53:46.019" style="s2">distribution with these few individuals</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.700" end="00:53:48.869" style="s2">sitting way out in the tail and being</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.019" end="00:53:50.789" style="s2">able to do this policing so you get the</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.869" end="00:53:51.960" style="s2">slow variable the this and the</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.789" end="00:53:53.549" style="s2">uncertainty reduction to the power</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.960" end="00:53:54.779" style="s2">distribution and then the surprise comes</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.549" end="00:53:57.690" style="s2">from the performance of this new</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.779" end="00:54:00.180" style="s2">function policing so again for me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.690" end="00:54:02.160" style="s2">not that mysterious emergence it comes</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.180" end="00:54:03.299" style="s2">from slow variables and coarse graining</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.160" end="00:54:05.730" style="s2">and uncertainty reduction and the</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.299" end="00:54:09.299" style="s2">production of surprise to new function</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.730" end="00:54:11.880" style="s2">and I don&#39;t think there&#39;s more to it</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.299" end="00:54:14.099" style="s2">than that I think one one thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.880" end="00:54:15.869" style="s2">hard to understand is sometimes why it</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.099" end="00:54:18.089" style="s2">doesn&#39;t occur and there are perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.869" end="00:54:19.589" style="s2">other ways than what I just described</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.089" end="00:54:20.819" style="s2">for it to be generated for example there</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.589" end="00:54:24.269" style="s2">was a study that came out the other day</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.819" end="00:54:25.859" style="s2">in Nature Physics on schooling behavior</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.269" end="00:54:28.920" style="s2">and fish that showed that you can get</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.859" end="00:54:30.990" style="s2">the schooling through noise the</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.920" end="00:54:32.460" style="s2">alignment decisions of the fish when</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.990" end="00:54:34.440" style="s2">they&#39;re noisy can push the fish from</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.460" end="00:54:36.480" style="s2">poorly aligned state to one where</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.440" end="00:54:38.069" style="s2">they&#39;re highly aligned and in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.480" end="00:54:39.990" style="s2">that&#39;s a very different mechanism that</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.069" end="00:54:41.190" style="s2">what I have been suggesting in the power</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.990" end="00:54:42.480" style="s2">case where it with the coarse grain</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.190" end="00:54:44.430" style="s2">there&#39;s no coarse graining necessary</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.480" end="00:54:46.549" style="s2">there and that&#39;s interesting but you</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.430" end="00:54:48.630" style="s2">have emergence potentially in both cases</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.549" end="00:54:50.490" style="s2">very interesting yeah for those</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.630" end="00:54:52.440" style="s2">interested in really digging into</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.490" end="00:54:54.029" style="s2">emergence one book I&#39;d recommend is the</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.440" end="00:54:55.050" style="s2">emergence of everything how the world</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.029" end="00:54:58.140" style="s2">became calm</p>

<p begin="00:55:42.270" end="00:55:47.580" style="s2">called the Russell&#39;s tradition I think</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.040" end="00:55:49.290" style="s2">that essentially complexity emerges in</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.580" end="00:55:52.250" style="s2">far from equilibrium systems and</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.290" end="00:55:54.870" style="s2">essentially it&#39;s the way the universe</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.250" end="00:55:58.050" style="s2">dissipates far from equilibrium energy</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.870" end="00:56:00.660" style="s2">flows is that the complex systems get</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.050" end="00:56:02.340" style="s2">spun up and they use up the energy and</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.660" end="00:56:04.260" style="s2">they degrade it by the second law and</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.340" end="00:56:06.450" style="s2">that&#39;s what they do and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.260" end="00:56:08.760" style="s2">essentially where complexity comes from</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.450" end="00:56:11.370" style="s2">I&#39;m from red producing in many many</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.760" end="00:56:13.200" style="s2">years but but I will say one thing I do</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.370" end="00:56:14.550" style="s2">agree that you know adaptive systems are</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.200" end="00:56:16.530" style="s2">obviously we don&#39;t really have the</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.550" end="00:56:18.870" style="s2">framework yet to deal with this</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.530" end="00:56:20.910" style="s2">non-equilibrium but that they recover</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.870" end="00:56:24.540" style="s2">some of those equilibrium properties by</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.910" end="00:56:26.490" style="s2">having kind of overlapping timescales so</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.540" end="00:56:27.300" style="s2">that they do create these slow variables</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.490" end="00:56:28.710" style="s2">that I keep talking about these</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.300" end="00:56:30.480" style="s2">coarse-grained variables that</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.710" end="00:56:33.600" style="s2">essentially give an effective</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.480" end="00:56:35.130" style="s2">equilibrium and an effective equilibrium</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.600" end="00:56:36.420" style="s2">so the slow variable creates a</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.130" end="00:56:38.430" style="s2">background that from the point of view</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.420" end="00:56:40.920" style="s2">of the component is more or less stable</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.430" end="00:56:43.710" style="s2">or constant and against which it can</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.920" end="00:56:45.450" style="s2">adapt and so on the one hand we need</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.710" end="00:56:47.010" style="s2">better formalisms and approaches for</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.450" end="00:56:49.440" style="s2">working in to working in non equilibrium</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.010" end="00:56:51.240" style="s2">ideas into adaptive systems for sure on</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.440" end="00:56:52.530" style="s2">the other hand I think adaptive systems</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.240" end="00:56:54.720" style="s2">have developed ways of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.530" end="00:56:56.130" style="s2">recovering essentially equilibrium</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.720" end="00:56:59.160" style="s2">states to these kind of effective</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.130" end="00:57:01.020" style="s2">sleeves so variables and and needs that</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.160" end="00:57:02.370" style="s2">these are haven&#39;t kind of an effective</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.020" end="00:57:03.960" style="s2">equilibrium as a consequence of these</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.370" end="00:57:05.789" style="s2">slow variables</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.960" end="00:57:07.920" style="s2">okay that&#39;s good yeah I always throw in</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.789" end="00:57:09.869" style="s2">a friggin question with s fi people</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.920" end="00:57:12.510" style="s2">because I always noticed that most of</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.869" end="00:57:14.549" style="s2">them either pushback or don&#39;t know too</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.510" end="00:57:16.799" style="s2">much about it I do think it&#39;s an area of</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.549" end="00:57:18.960" style="s2">complexity that I wish the SFI people</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.799" end="00:57:20.430" style="s2">would learn more about right I do think</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.960" end="00:57:22.140" style="s2">it has some merit that&#39;s my editorial</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.430" end="00:57:23.430" style="s2">comment for the day I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.140" end="00:57:25.470" style="s2">fair point Jim I mean it&#39;s one of those</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.430" end="00:57:27.150" style="s2">things that we sort of cover or learned</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.470" end="00:57:28.710" style="s2">about it you know in early days in our</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.150" end="00:57:30.539" style="s2">early work at complex systems and at the</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.710" end="00:57:32.010" style="s2">summer school and so forth and and I</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.539" end="00:57:33.630" style="s2">haven&#39;t really thought about too much</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.010" end="00:57:33.990" style="s2">since and I should take a look at it</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.630" end="00:57:36.329" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.990" end="00:57:40.020" style="s2">cool let&#39;s move on to the next topic</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.329" end="00:57:42.119" style="s2">from your edge bio you say a central</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.020" end="00:57:43.829" style="s2">philosophical issue behind this work</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.119" end="00:57:46.109" style="s2">meaning your work is how nature</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.829" end="00:57:47.849" style="s2">overcomes subjectivity there&#39;s that word</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.109" end="00:57:50.849" style="s2">again inherent and information</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.849" end="00:57:54.210" style="s2">processing systems to produce collective</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.849" end="00:57:55.529" style="s2">ordered states yeah pretty much a</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.210" end="00:57:58.319" style="s2">summary of all I think you talked about</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.529" end="00:58:00.500" style="s2">but you do pose it as a philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.319" end="00:58:02.789" style="s2">issue so what do you think are the</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.500" end="00:58:05.430" style="s2">philosophical implications of your work</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.789" end="00:58:07.440" style="s2">are there truly metaphysical issues that</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.430" end="00:58:10.049" style="s2">arise or can complex the including</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.440" end="00:58:12.000" style="s2">emergence be described strictly in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.049" end="00:58:14.279" style="s2">language of science inside a realist</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.000" end="00:58:17.510" style="s2">program with no recourse to metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.279" end="00:58:21.180" style="s2">I think that it&#39;s you know in the end</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.510" end="00:58:23.520" style="s2">science is is sufficient I do believe</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.180" end="00:58:25.680" style="s2">that but most of the work that I do and</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.520" end="00:58:27.539" style="s2">some of us if I fall into this camp is</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.680" end="00:58:30.180" style="s2">very much in the business of taking</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.539" end="00:58:31.829" style="s2">concepts that from philosophy or that</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.180" end="00:58:35.010" style="s2">are sort of outside of science and</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.829" end="00:58:38.069" style="s2">turning them into questions that can be</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.010" end="00:58:40.680" style="s2">approached using scientific methods so</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.069" end="00:58:42.450" style="s2">all of my work sir sits on the on the</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.680" end="00:58:43.880" style="s2">edge or between philosophy on that</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.450" end="00:58:46.289" style="s2">border between philosophy and science</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.880" end="00:58:48.299" style="s2">but we&#39;re very much in the business of</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.289" end="00:58:49.950" style="s2">taking these questions that maybe from a</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.299" end="00:58:53.660" style="s2">science perspective seem ill or poorly</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.950" end="00:58:55.650" style="s2">defined from a science perspective and</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.660" end="00:58:57.119" style="s2">turning them into something that to a</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.650" end="00:59:00.450" style="s2">model that can be analyzed</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.119" end="00:59:02.700" style="s2">mathematically or approach with data so</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.450" end="00:59:04.500" style="s2">you know I&#39;m at that border for sure and</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.700" end="00:59:06.390" style="s2">there are other XY people who are who</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.500" end="00:59:08.010" style="s2">are not anywhere near that border and</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.390" end="00:59:10.380" style="s2">much more interested in you know they</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.010" end="00:59:11.730" style="s2">develop profound methods for thinking</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.380" end="00:59:13.570" style="s2">about networks but their questions are</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.730" end="00:59:15.310" style="s2">very clearly defined from the get-go</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.570" end="00:59:18.040" style="s2">so that&#39;s my partial answer to your</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.310" end="00:59:20.170" style="s2">question give me an example of part of</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.040" end="00:59:22.750" style="s2">your work that&#39;s actually informed by an</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.170" end="00:59:24.180" style="s2">actual philosophical question certainly</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.750" end="00:59:26.230" style="s2">this this distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.180" end="00:59:28.450" style="s2">collectively constructed macroscopic</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.230" end="00:59:30.070" style="s2">world and a ground truth that&#39;s right so</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.450" end="00:59:32.440" style="s2">this is a and downward causation is</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.070" end="00:59:34.420" style="s2">another one right most biologists or</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.440" end="00:59:36.130" style="s2">most people work in adaptive systems are</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.420" end="00:59:37.690" style="s2">you know generally thinking about the</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.130" end="00:59:39.190" style="s2">system learning about states of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.690" end="00:59:40.990" style="s2">world where the states of the world are</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.190" end="00:59:43.720" style="s2">serving so genus - the system outside</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.990" end="00:59:46.390" style="s2">its control and I think we need to you</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.720" end="00:59:48.610" style="s2">know take seriously that by by virtue of</p>

<p begin="00:59:50.320" end="00:59:54.040" style="s2">constructed and so those ideas come from</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.120" end="00:59:55.360" style="s2">you know originally to come out of</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.040" end="00:59:56.890" style="s2">certain areas of philosophy and</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.360" end="00:59:59.560" style="s2">definitely some of the structural and</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.890" end="01:00:00.600" style="s2">early 20th century anthropologists we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.560" end="01:00:03.430" style="s2">thinking about these kinds of things</p>

<p begin="01:00:06.190" end="01:00:10.810" style="s2">on there&#39;s been a lot of influence from</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.570" end="01:00:13.140" style="s2">those literature&#39;s in early days to my</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.810" end="01:00:15.640" style="s2">syrup original thinking about this stuff</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.140" end="01:00:17.140" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s good yeah it is interesting</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.640" end="01:00:18.310" style="s2">because some of the most interesting</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.140" end="01:00:20.050" style="s2">problems are right in there in that</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.310" end="01:00:21.940" style="s2">liminal space where we don&#39;t even quite</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.050" end="01:00:24.640" style="s2">know how to fully state the problem</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.940" end="01:00:26.530" style="s2">correctly that&#39;s right at least</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.640" end="01:00:28.900" style="s2">initially you know so we kind of iterate</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.530" end="01:00:30.100" style="s2">between what is the problem exactly and</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.900" end="01:00:31.390" style="s2">once you get the problem stated right</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.100" end="01:00:35.020" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s not that hard to figure</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.390" end="01:00:37.720" style="s2">out yeah I know that&#39;s that is sort of</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.020" end="01:00:38.980" style="s2">what we do exactly that yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.720" end="01:00:41.710" style="s2">actually one of my insights into</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.980" end="01:00:43.540" style="s2">artificial general intelligence is a lot</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.710" end="01:00:45.630" style="s2">of the work being invested in today by</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.540" end="01:00:47.010" style="s2">companies like Google is in so-called</p>

<p begin="01:00:47.010" end="01:00:52.450" style="s2">capabilities I keep pushing back and say</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.480" end="01:00:53.560" style="s2">I want to see question-asking capability</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.450" end="01:00:56.860" style="s2">that would be far more impressive</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.560" end="01:00:58.450" style="s2">actually right people look at me like</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.860" end="01:01:00.490" style="s2">I&#39;m nuts but I think you get it</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.450" end="01:01:02.920" style="s2">ya know I highly value that that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.490" end="01:01:05.110" style="s2">I found that frankly and my working with</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.920" end="01:01:06.970" style="s2">scientists that really best ones are the</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.110" end="01:01:09.610" style="s2">ones that are the best in asking</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.970" end="01:01:11.440" style="s2">questions and the variants and their</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.610" end="01:01:13.360" style="s2">ability to answer questions is less than</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.440" end="01:01:14.830" style="s2">their ability to ask questions that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.360" end="01:01:16.180" style="s2">good cuz I feel that&#39;s my skill and</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.830" end="01:01:19.240" style="s2">sometimes I have no ability to answer my</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.180" end="01:01:21.040" style="s2">own questions ah well I chose that</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.240" end="01:01:24.090" style="s2">you&#39;re brilliant so that&#39;s good by the</p>

<p begin="01:01:24.090" end="01:01:29.520" style="s2">we were really true love it</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.510" end="01:01:31.110" style="s2">another thing you wrote recent I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.520" end="01:01:33.870" style="s2">know it was recently or not but chapter</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.110" end="01:01:36.930" style="s2">nine and a work called social and</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.870" end="01:01:40.800" style="s2">economic engineering mmm-hmm I read that</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.930" end="01:01:43.200" style="s2">and it reminded me of the possibly false</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.800" end="01:01:45.870" style="s2">Road many of us nerdy kids went down</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.200" end="01:01:48.540" style="s2">when we read the foundation trilogy way</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.870" end="01:01:50.730" style="s2">back yonder and Harry Selden in his</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.540" end="01:01:52.860" style="s2">psycho history and social engineering</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.730" end="01:01:54.540" style="s2">and of course it&#39;s worth noting that the</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.860" end="01:01:56.460" style="s2">foundation trilogy it&#39;s just been</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.540" end="01:01:58.080" style="s2">announced it&#39;s gonna be made into a TV</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.460" end="01:01:59.130" style="s2">series from Apple that should be</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.080" end="01:02:01.500" style="s2">interesting how the heck are they gonna</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.130" end="01:02:04.110" style="s2">make a science fiction series from a</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.500" end="01:02:05.700" style="s2">really deep intellectual story that has</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.110" end="01:02:08.550" style="s2">no sex and no violence</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.700" end="01:02:10.280" style="s2">hmmm that may take some work yeah but</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.550" end="01:02:13.350" style="s2">anyway to the topic of social economic</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.280" end="01:02:15.570" style="s2">engineering you seem to take the lime if</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.350" end="01:02:18.030" style="s2">I read it correctly that hey maybe we</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.570" end="01:02:20.220" style="s2">can now do some social engineering and</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.030" end="01:02:22.350" style="s2">economic engineering what say you to</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.220" end="01:02:24.630" style="s2">that yeah so I mean I think a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.350" end="01:02:26.310" style="s2">them so I&#39;ve written a couple little</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.630" end="01:02:28.440" style="s2">essays on this and I and I think a lot</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.310" end="01:02:30.510" style="s2">of the engineering that we&#39;ve done has</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.440" end="01:02:33.690" style="s2">been sort of reactive and qualitative</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.510" end="01:02:35.730" style="s2">and so with big data with some methods</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.690" end="01:02:38.010" style="s2">and concepts I&#39;ll talk about in a second</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.730" end="01:02:41.070" style="s2">and with machine learning and so forth I</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.010" end="01:02:42.810" style="s2">think we are at this point where there</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.070" end="01:02:45.600" style="s2">could be a big change in how we engineer</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.810" end="01:02:47.010" style="s2">things and you see a little bit of that</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.600" end="01:02:49.680" style="s2">the sort of foreshadowing of that with</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.010" end="01:02:51.060" style="s2">the sort of sort of Facebook stuff both</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.680" end="01:02:53.280" style="s2">from the science side and the</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.060" end="01:02:55.620" style="s2">intervention interference by you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.280" end="01:02:57.960" style="s2">Russia or whomever into on Facebook</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.620" end="01:02:59.910" style="s2">basically what&#39;s happening is that we</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.960" end="01:03:02.360" style="s2">now have vast quantities of microscopic</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.910" end="01:03:04.860" style="s2">data of data on individual behavior and</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.360" end="01:03:06.480" style="s2">and we&#39;re in a position where for the</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.860" end="01:03:09.660" style="s2">first time and it comes back to these</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.480" end="01:03:12.840" style="s2">micro to macro maps so no and in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.660" end="01:03:14.310" style="s2">just as an aside that&#39;s that sort of an</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.840" end="01:03:15.780" style="s2">important aside and in the Jeffrey work</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.310" end="01:03:17.490" style="s2">on scaling you know they had the</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.780" end="01:03:18.990" style="s2">macroscopic observable math scales of</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.490" end="01:03:20.910" style="s2">metabolic rate and they had some axioms</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.990" end="01:03:22.770" style="s2">from which they derive the microscopic</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.910" end="01:03:24.630" style="s2">so they have they build this micro to</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.770" end="01:03:25.980" style="s2">macro map and what I&#39;ve been saying for</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.630" end="01:03:27.450" style="s2">the information processing systems is</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.980" end="01:03:30.630" style="s2">you can&#39;t build that micro to macro mat</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.450" end="01:03:31.890" style="s2">without having some idea of how the sort</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.630" end="01:03:33.450" style="s2">of components are processing information</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.890" end="01:03:34.440" style="s2">how they&#39;re getting building their</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.450" end="01:03:35.010" style="s2">effective theories for how the world</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.440" end="01:03:36.990" style="s2">works</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.010" end="01:03:38.369" style="s2">to do that you need good microscopic</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.990" end="01:03:39.780" style="s2">data you need data on what they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.369" end="01:03:42.420" style="s2">how they see the world what their</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.780" end="01:03:44.520" style="s2">strategies are and so with Simon today</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.420" end="01:03:46.020" style="s2">on David Krakauer we developed this</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.520" end="01:03:48.300" style="s2">approach called inductive game theory a</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.020" end="01:03:50.490" style="s2">while ago which is basically it was a</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.300" end="01:03:52.020" style="s2">kind of response to simple game theory</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.490" end="01:03:53.670" style="s2">models a negative response then where</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.020" end="01:03:55.859" style="s2">the strategies and the payoffs</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.670" end="01:03:57.270" style="s2">everything&#39;s being posited in toy models</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.859" end="01:03:58.440" style="s2">and what we said well no we want to go</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.270" end="01:04:00.180" style="s2">into the data and actually pull the</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.440" end="01:04:01.980" style="s2">strategies out so you get all this you</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.180" end="01:04:04.109" style="s2">have this rich time series on individual</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.980" end="01:04:05.850" style="s2">interactions and behavior going to that</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.109" end="01:04:07.200" style="s2">time series and try and extract the</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.850" end="01:04:08.910" style="s2">strategies that the individuals are</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.200" end="01:04:11.280" style="s2">using to make decisions in their social</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.910" end="01:04:13.500" style="s2">environment and once you have these</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.280" end="01:04:16.260" style="s2">strategies and you build up you know how</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.500" end="01:04:17.790" style="s2">they collectively interact and to do</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.260" end="01:04:19.470" style="s2">this we built circuits of how these</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.790" end="01:04:21.630" style="s2">strategies interact to produce a</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.470" end="01:04:23.580" style="s2">macroscopic property of interest like in</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.630" end="01:04:26.910" style="s2">an animal society to fight size or power</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.580" end="01:04:28.440" style="s2">distribution it could be a city variable</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.910" end="01:04:29.670" style="s2">anything really and so it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.440" end="01:04:32.270" style="s2">different way of building a micro to</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.670" end="01:04:37.440" style="s2">macro map then then in this sort of like</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.270" end="01:04:38.880" style="s2">mass metabolic rate case and what we one</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.440" end="01:04:41.119" style="s2">of the reasons we wanted to build these</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.880" end="01:04:43.200" style="s2">maps in addition to you know the</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.119" end="01:04:45.900" style="s2">foundational region which reason which</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.200" end="01:04:48.119" style="s2">is getting out laws in information</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.900" end="01:04:49.440" style="s2">processing systems and figuring out what</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.119" end="01:04:50.700" style="s2">those laws are taking the citizens point</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.440" end="01:04:52.140" style="s2">of view and having you know all those</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.700" end="01:04:54.450" style="s2">strategies and data from the system</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.140" end="01:04:56.070" style="s2">itself another reason is because we</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.450" end="01:04:58.710" style="s2">thought by having these micro to macro</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.070" end="01:05:01.440" style="s2">maps and then understanding how you</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.710" end="01:05:04.440" style="s2">simplify them or how the system</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.440" end="01:05:07.080" style="s2">simplifies them to make decisions would</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.440" end="01:05:09.810" style="s2">tell us in a more informed way and</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.080" end="01:05:11.550" style="s2">potentially highly quantitative way what</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.810" end="01:05:13.680" style="s2">interventions we could perform to induce</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.550" end="01:05:15.900" style="s2">changes at the macroscopic level like in</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.680" end="01:05:17.970" style="s2">social structure for example so if you</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.900" end="01:05:20.580" style="s2">had a theory for how power distribution</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.970" end="01:05:23.250" style="s2">was arising in a given system and you</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.580" end="01:05:24.359" style="s2">knew what the dominant causal coming</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.250" end="01:05:26.430" style="s2">back to our causality discussion</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.359" end="01:05:28.830" style="s2">dominant causal contributors are to a</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.430" end="01:05:30.600" style="s2">particular power distribution then you</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.830" end="01:05:33.230" style="s2">can intervene in a more informed way on</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.600" end="01:05:35.640" style="s2">those variables or individuals to change</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.230" end="01:05:39.420" style="s2">the type of power distribution that you</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.640" end="01:05:42.119" style="s2">see and so the basic idea is that by by</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.420" end="01:05:43.740" style="s2">developing methods for studying micro to</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.119" end="01:05:45.170" style="s2">macro maps and information processing</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.740" end="01:05:46.800" style="s2">systems we could make more informed</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.170" end="01:05:48.190" style="s2">interventions and potentially</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.800" end="01:05:51.579" style="s2">potentially engine</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.190" end="01:05:53.410" style="s2">your outcomes in social systems and I</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.579" end="01:05:54.400" style="s2">think we we are going to be able to do</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.410" end="01:05:57.190" style="s2">that now</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.400" end="01:06:00.099" style="s2">of course one complexity that arises is</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.190" end="01:06:01.720" style="s2">that as everyone can do this everyone</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.099" end="01:06:03.339" style="s2">when you know you adopt this approach</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.720" end="01:06:05.530" style="s2">can build better models using</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.339" end="01:06:07.380" style="s2">microscopic data of multiple different</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.530" end="01:06:09.880" style="s2">groups nations corporations whatever</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.380" end="01:06:11.890" style="s2">together intervening you&#39;re gonna create</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.880" end="01:06:13.660" style="s2">a lot more complexity and you might</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.890" end="01:06:15.250" style="s2">actually make it because they&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.660" end="01:06:17.589" style="s2">know all these now these couple systems</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.250" end="01:06:19.540" style="s2">competing you might make it very hard to</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.589" end="01:06:22.359" style="s2">control the consequences of your</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.540" end="01:06:25.240" style="s2">intervention coevolution will have a</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.359" end="01:06:29.440" style="s2">coevolution of complex interventions</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.240" end="01:06:31.599" style="s2">effectively exactly that means happen</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.440" end="01:06:34.089" style="s2">now I think it&#39;s already happening yeah</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.599" end="01:06:35.680" style="s2">exactly we just don&#39;t know it yet very</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.089" end="01:06:37.810" style="s2">good very good I like that</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.680" end="01:06:39.670" style="s2">that last insight is actually the</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.810" end="01:06:42.040" style="s2">coolest thing I think that we&#39;ve said on</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.670" end="01:06:44.589" style="s2">this show is that as we get greater</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.040" end="01:06:46.660" style="s2">insight in how to control complex social</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.589" end="01:06:48.339" style="s2">systems inevitably there will be a</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.660" end="01:06:50.710" style="s2">co-evolutionary war of such</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.339" end="01:06:54.250" style="s2">interventions ah yeah it&#39;s just another</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.710" end="01:06:55.690" style="s2">version of gephardt&#39;s law yes indeed get</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.250" end="01:06:58.660" style="s2">back to the Harry Selden thing I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.690" end="01:07:00.730" style="s2">for fun both Jessica and I are really</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.660" end="01:07:05.490" style="s2">serious Lord of the Rings nerds I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.730" end="01:07:08.290" style="s2">think I&#39;ve read it 39 times that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.490" end="01:07:09.910" style="s2">Lord of the Rings nerd as I recall it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.290" end="01:07:11.770" style="s2">of our conversations we said okay what</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.910" end="01:07:14.079" style="s2">character are you I think you said you</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.770" end="01:07:16.480" style="s2">were Eragon is that correct yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.079" end="01:07:18.490" style="s2">Erin that&#39;s right now Tom Bombadil</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.480" end="01:07:20.800" style="s2">without a doubt right that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.490" end="01:07:22.770" style="s2">price I think that&#39;s a great choice I</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.800" end="01:07:25.780" style="s2">know jealous but anyway so back to</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.770" end="01:07:27.790" style="s2">foundation trilogy of the folks working</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.780" end="01:07:30.790" style="s2">on this work that we know about I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.790" end="01:07:32.619" style="s2">just decided that Simon is Harry Selden</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.790" end="01:07:34.660" style="s2">that&#39;s funny you say that because so</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.619" end="01:07:36.520" style="s2">Harry so I when I give the talk I</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.660" end="01:07:37.869" style="s2">haven&#39;t given the talk in a couple years</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.520" end="01:07:39.339" style="s2">but used to give the talk an inductive</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.869" end="01:07:41.950" style="s2">game theory in the circuits in micro to</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.339" end="01:07:44.380" style="s2">macro map rarely regularly and and I did</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.950" end="01:07:46.900" style="s2">that work with Simon and and every time</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.380" end="01:07:48.480" style="s2">particularly actually in audiences with</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.900" end="01:07:51.880" style="s2">some physicists I would be called</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.480" end="01:07:53.619" style="s2">accused of being Harry Selden yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.880" end="01:07:55.119" style="s2">maybe you&#39;re Harry Selden well I move</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.619" end="01:07:57.339" style="s2">east of what the inductive game theory</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.119" end="01:07:59.920" style="s2">that&#39;s Harry Selden though Simon looks</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.339" end="01:08:03.019" style="s2">like Harry Selden he looks like</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.920" end="01:08:05.420" style="s2">at Simon did a oh by the way who was my</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.019" end="01:08:07.579" style="s2">very first guest on the gym rut show so</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.420" end="01:08:09.380" style="s2">go look at episode number one and you</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.579" end="01:08:12.049" style="s2">can hear very very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.380" end="01:08:14.779" style="s2">far-ranging conversation with simon de</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.049" end="01:08:16.819" style="s2">deo aka Harry Selden let&#39;s go on to</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.779" end="01:08:18.770" style="s2">another topic agent-based models have</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.819" end="01:08:21.109" style="s2">long been part of the work at SFI</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.770" end="01:08:22.819" style="s2">exploring complexity do you have a view</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.109" end="01:08:24.409" style="s2">of the strengths and dangers from that</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.819" end="01:08:25.639" style="s2">approach yeah so I had this sort of</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.409" end="01:08:28.099" style="s2">canonical view of the strains and</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.639" end="01:08:30.230" style="s2">dangers I think that you know in the the</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.099" end="01:08:31.730" style="s2">the sort of standard thing you hear</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.230" end="01:08:33.139" style="s2">everyone complain about is to put</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.730" end="01:08:35.359" style="s2">anything in and that anything comes out</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.139" end="01:08:37.369" style="s2">garbage in garbage out and so I think</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.359" end="01:08:39.139" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of bad agent-based</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.369" end="01:08:41.630" style="s2">modeling out there you know there are</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.139" end="01:08:43.790" style="s2">now there are like little agent-based</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.630" end="01:08:45.859" style="s2">modeling worlds and even without sort of</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.790" end="01:08:48.020" style="s2">thinking hard like same happened of</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.859" end="01:08:49.969" style="s2">course for statistics with SPSS and so</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.020" end="01:08:52.339" style="s2">forth and anyone can use these programs</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.969" end="01:08:54.230" style="s2">to build a nature base model and so a</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.339" end="01:08:55.549" style="s2">lot of bad science gets done of course</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.230" end="01:08:57.290" style="s2">there&#39;s good agent-based modeling and</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.549" end="01:09:00.920" style="s2">epstein and excellence some of these</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.290" end="01:09:05.089" style="s2">other guys who know they&#39;re doing very</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.920" end="01:09:06.319" style="s2">thoughtful work but though at this sort</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.089" end="01:09:08.409" style="s2">of crudest level when an agent meets</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.319" end="01:09:10.460" style="s2">model is it&#39;s just tracking individual</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.409" end="01:09:11.960" style="s2">individual level behavior tracking</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.460" end="01:09:13.460" style="s2">individuals I mean that&#39;s you can define</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.960" end="01:09:14.750" style="s2">it that could be like the simplest</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.460" end="01:09:16.429" style="s2">definition of an age of each model of</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.750" end="01:09:18.679" style="s2">tracks individuals and so in that sense</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.429" end="01:09:20.119" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot a lot of modeling of</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.679" end="01:09:21.920" style="s2">modelling frameworks fall under</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.119" end="01:09:23.420" style="s2">agent-based modeling they&#39;re just not</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.920" end="01:09:25.609" style="s2">what we sort of canonically think of</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.420" end="01:09:27.319" style="s2">each of a small again and so in that</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.609" end="01:09:30.259" style="s2">sense to the inductive game theory that</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.319" end="01:09:32.179" style="s2">I just mentioned falls in that in that</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.259" end="01:09:33.949" style="s2">space and and the difference though</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.179" end="01:09:35.210" style="s2">between I&#39;d say the way that we do</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.949" end="01:09:36.949" style="s2">inductive game theory and the way that</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.210" end="01:09:39.349" style="s2">each of these modeling is often</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.949" end="01:09:41.540" style="s2">approached is that the strategies that</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.349" end="01:09:45.829" style="s2">we use in our models come directly from</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.540" end="01:09:50.449" style="s2">the data and so I am fine and in fact</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.829" end="01:09:53.480" style="s2">advocate this approach if you&#39;re if your</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.449" end="01:09:55.909" style="s2">strategies are empirical you know if and</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.480" end="01:09:58.429" style="s2">and if you&#39;re and if you are rigorous</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.909" end="01:10:00.650" style="s2">and thoughtful about how many of them</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.429" end="01:10:02.000" style="s2">you put in right so you know you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.650" end="01:10:03.739" style="s2">want to build you don&#39;t want to take</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.000" end="01:10:04.969" style="s2">into account a huge number of strategies</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.739" end="01:10:07.310" style="s2">you want to have some understanding of</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.969" end="01:10:10.639" style="s2">what the most important ones are and and</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.310" end="01:10:12.530" style="s2">begin with those and so yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.639" end="01:10:13.010" style="s2">Asian B&#39;s modelling is powerful you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.530" end="01:10:14.239" style="s2">it can give</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.010" end="01:10:16.670" style="s2">a lot of insight it&#39;s just that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.239" end="01:10:18.969" style="s2">easy to abuse yeah that&#39;s a very good</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.670" end="01:10:22.460" style="s2">way I recently attended a workshop</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.969" end="01:10:23.690" style="s2">organized by Josh Epstein and Rob Axtell</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.460" end="01:10:26.059" style="s2">and some others called inverse</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.690" end="01:10:28.429" style="s2">generative social science gentlemen</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.059" end="01:10:30.289" style="s2">great yep yep and one of the points was</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.429" end="01:10:31.849" style="s2">hey let&#39;s start with the data when we</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.289" end="01:10:33.829" style="s2">can what a concept right</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.849" end="01:10:36.380" style="s2">and then let&#39;s generate things like</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.829" end="01:10:38.809" style="s2">maybe genetic programming from the data</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.380" end="01:10:41.059" style="s2">and then let&#39;s the agents be those right</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.809" end="01:10:43.010" style="s2">as a way that does not make some stuff</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.059" end="01:10:45.250" style="s2">up because I remember when I first</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.010" end="01:10:47.269" style="s2">retired from business started playing</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.250" end="01:10:48.860" style="s2">pseudoscientist one of the first things</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.269" end="01:10:50.750" style="s2">I played with was agent-based modeling</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.860" end="01:10:52.940" style="s2">and my models would have forty seven</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.750" end="01:10:55.840" style="s2">variables which I just made up when I</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.940" end="01:10:58.579" style="s2">got out to SF I quickly got schooled on</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.840" end="01:11:01.730" style="s2">47 variables that&#39;s ridiculous</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.579" end="01:11:04.039" style="s2">three three variables and two or one is</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.730" end="01:11:05.659" style="s2">better right and they were right so you</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.039" end="01:11:06.980" style="s2">got to be really careful when you do</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.659" end="01:11:09.289" style="s2">this stuff but you can&#39;t get some</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.980" end="01:11:11.329" style="s2">amazing insights yeah I mean you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.289" end="01:11:12.769" style="s2">I&#39;m a pluralist I think that we gain</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.329" end="01:11:15.349" style="s2">insight by using lots of different tools</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.769" end="01:11:17.570" style="s2">and approaches and so agent may smiling</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.349" end="01:11:21.139" style="s2">or you know tracking individuals coupled</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.570" end="01:11:23.389" style="s2">to extremely reduced you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.139" end="01:11:25.820" style="s2">phenomenological model where you can do</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.389" end="01:11:28.039" style="s2">you can analyze the model you know is</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.820" end="01:11:30.500" style="s2">you want as many you know multiple</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.039" end="01:11:32.239" style="s2">perspectives on a problem and they each</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.500" end="01:11:35.599" style="s2">do different things and it&#39;s sort of the</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.239" end="01:11:37.360" style="s2">you know it&#39;s a collective outcome that</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.599" end="01:11:39.710" style="s2">helps you understand what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.360" end="01:11:42.469" style="s2">very good you&#39;ve written a lot about</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.710" end="01:11:45.110" style="s2">social policing and its effects on</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.469" end="01:11:47.510" style="s2">social systems I really like your paper</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.110" end="01:11:50.960" style="s2">policing stabilises construction of</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.510" end="01:11:53.599" style="s2">niches and primates back to our Apes and</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.960" end="01:11:56.420" style="s2">monkeys tell us about that what we did</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.599" end="01:11:58.460" style="s2">that study is we wanted to assess the</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.420" end="01:11:59.960" style="s2">contribution of policing to social</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.460" end="01:12:01.760" style="s2">system robustness so I already talked a</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.960" end="01:12:03.260" style="s2">little bit about that and we developed a</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.760" end="01:12:05.599" style="s2">set of experimental techniques to</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.260" end="01:12:08.300" style="s2">identify the consequences of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.599" end="01:12:09.679" style="s2">policing to robustness by taking to</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.300" end="01:12:10.880" style="s2">account both the causal contribution and</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.679" end="01:12:12.860" style="s2">exclusion dependence and I measured</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.880" end="01:12:14.809" style="s2">earlier and so basically in that study</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.860" end="01:12:18.920" style="s2">we had a like half a football sized</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.809" end="01:12:19.969" style="s2">colony of of macaques there was a heavy</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.920" end="01:12:21.380" style="s2">tail distribution of power and the</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.969" end="01:12:23.210" style="s2">individuals in the tail performance</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.380" end="01:12:26.210" style="s2">policing behavior and we we removed them</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.210" end="01:12:26.900" style="s2">temporarily over the course of say 20</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.210" end="01:12:28.909" style="s2">weeks</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.900" end="01:12:32.239" style="s2">on randomly chosen days once every week</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.909" end="01:12:33.920" style="s2">or so and and we studied how social</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.239" end="01:12:35.780" style="s2">networks and various social variables</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.920" end="01:12:37.280" style="s2">changed when they were removed and</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.780" end="01:12:39.790" style="s2">inferred from that the contribution of</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.280" end="01:12:42.830" style="s2">their policing behavior to things like</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.790" end="01:12:44.420" style="s2">how connected the networks are how</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.830" end="01:12:46.699" style="s2">negative a positive behavior spread over</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.420" end="01:12:48.890" style="s2">those networks to how cliquish the</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.699" end="01:12:51.800" style="s2">societies were in the presence and</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.890" end="01:12:53.179" style="s2">absence of the policing mechanism to how</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.800" end="01:12:55.460" style="s2">often individuals showed aggression</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.179" end="01:12:57.409" style="s2">versus socially positive behaviors as a</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.460" end="01:12:58.670" style="s2">consequence of the policing so yeah it</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.409" end="01:13:00.949" style="s2">was one of the first what I would call</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.670" end="01:13:02.690" style="s2">behavioral knockouts so most knockout</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.949" end="01:13:04.969" style="s2">work is done on genes or in molecular</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.690" end="01:13:07.670" style="s2">systems and there really hasn&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.969" end="01:13:09.050" style="s2">rigorous Network knockouts in social</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.670" end="01:13:10.310" style="s2">systems and that was sort of one of the</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.050" end="01:13:12.530" style="s2">first there had been much earlier</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.310" end="01:13:14.300" style="s2">studies in the 60s where the scientists</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.530" end="01:13:15.469" style="s2">sort of like just removed the</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.300" end="01:13:17.330" style="s2">individuals they thought were strong or</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.469" end="01:13:19.130" style="s2">powerful without really a theory for</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.330" end="01:13:22.610" style="s2">what would happen as a result of those</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.130" end="01:13:24.860" style="s2">removals but but we we had a lot more of</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.610" end="01:13:27.800" style="s2">the more of the ideas worked out when we</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.860" end="01:13:29.929" style="s2">did this knock out study so as zoos it</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.800" end="01:13:33.080" style="s2">was very you know was um it was fun and</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.929" end="01:13:34.699" style="s2">what we found was that in fact in the</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.080" end="01:13:37.360" style="s2">what the policing mechanism did is it</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.699" end="01:13:39.560" style="s2">made the system more integrated</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.360" end="01:13:41.750" style="s2">individuals had a larger number of</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.560" end="01:13:43.100" style="s2">partners and their social networks they</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.750" end="01:13:45.860" style="s2">had better relationships with those</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.100" end="01:13:48.590" style="s2">partners there was less volatility right</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.860" end="01:13:50.510" style="s2">so there was less aggression the police</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.590" end="01:13:52.960" style="s2">things seemed to allow individuals to</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.510" end="01:13:55.429" style="s2">build better local social environments</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.960" end="01:13:58.940" style="s2">so the hippies were wrong you can&#39;t off</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.429" end="01:14:01.130" style="s2">the pigs haha yeah so I don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.940" end="01:14:03.140" style="s2">mean I think there you know there there</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.130" end="01:14:05.540" style="s2">are lots of things to discuss here about</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.140" end="01:14:07.790" style="s2">you know how about inequality and you</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.540" end="01:14:11.060" style="s2">Galit aryan societies and our sort of</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.790" end="01:14:13.219" style="s2">knee-jerk reactions to the 1% and so</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.060" end="01:14:14.600" style="s2">forth I think we really need to approach</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.219" end="01:14:16.969" style="s2">that in a more thoughtful way it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.600" end="01:14:18.890" style="s2">clear to me that having a system with</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.969" end="01:14:22.010" style="s2">billionaires is necessarily problematic</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.890" end="01:14:23.870" style="s2">and it may in fact be that with what you</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.010" end="01:14:26.210" style="s2">need are certain kinds of regulations to</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.870" end="01:14:27.260" style="s2">incentivize good behavior but when you</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.210" end="01:14:28.940" style="s2">have individuals who are really out</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.260" end="01:14:32.000" style="s2">there in the tale their ability to do</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.940" end="01:14:33.980" style="s2">things faster more efficiently than say</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.000" end="01:14:36.469" style="s2">government might be quite a bit higher</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.980" end="01:14:37.949" style="s2">and so these are trade-offs we need to</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.469" end="01:14:39.570" style="s2">really you know think hard about</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.949" end="01:14:41.070" style="s2">like how do we if we&#39;re gonna have we</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.570" end="01:14:42.929" style="s2">have a system where government can do</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.070" end="01:14:44.190" style="s2">certain things and you know individuals</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.929" end="01:14:46.679" style="s2">out there and the tale can do other</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.190" end="01:14:48.809" style="s2">things but we want but because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.679" end="01:14:50.309" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of like potentially could go</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.809" end="01:14:53.459" style="s2">rogue we want to create incentives so</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.309" end="01:14:55.079" style="s2">they do the right things so that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.459" end="01:14:57.869" style="s2">you know that&#39;s the question for me is</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.079" end="01:15:00.059" style="s2">is it&#39;s an empirical question what the</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.869" end="01:15:02.519" style="s2">best system is and not an ideological</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.059" end="01:15:04.559" style="s2">one and I wish there were no more</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.519" end="01:15:05.999" style="s2">empirical studies of how these different</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.559" end="01:15:07.469" style="s2">social structures what their</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.999" end="01:15:09.090" style="s2">consequences are there are some in</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.469" end="01:15:10.409" style="s2">economics but I think we&#39;re you know</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.090" end="01:15:13.289" style="s2">really really only getting to get</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.409" end="01:15:16.050" style="s2">beginning to get a sense of of the full</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.289" end="01:15:18.420" style="s2">picture yeah folks we know Sam Bowles</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.050" end="01:15:19.679" style="s2">and herb Ginn tests have done work along</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.420" end="01:15:22.229" style="s2">with some other folks that strongly</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.679" end="01:15:25.679" style="s2">imply that the kind of work that you saw</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.229" end="01:15:27.449" style="s2">in primates also applies to humans in</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.679" end="01:15:28.729" style="s2">some of the simple games that they have</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.449" end="01:15:31.440" style="s2">set up all around the world</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.729" end="01:15:34.320" style="s2">cross-culturally where the existence of</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.440" end="01:15:36.179" style="s2">the ability to punish bad actors reduces</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.320" end="01:15:38.219" style="s2">bad action mm-hmm do you have any</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.179" end="01:15:40.949" style="s2">thoughts on you know how this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.219" end="01:15:42.900" style="s2">work applies to humans well I mean one</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.949" end="01:15:44.130" style="s2">thing just you mentioned punishment I</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.900" end="01:15:45.900" style="s2">mean one of the things that was very</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.130" end="01:15:47.729" style="s2">important in the in the primates</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.900" end="01:15:50.039" style="s2">you know robustness and interventions</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.729" end="01:15:51.479" style="s2">conflict work is that the police are</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.039" end="01:15:53.010" style="s2">there to proceed to be</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.479" end="01:15:55.349" style="s2">disproportionately powerful so no one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.010" end="01:15:56.489" style="s2">gonna challenge them but it seems to be</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.349" end="01:15:58.889" style="s2">critically important that they actually</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.489" end="01:16:00.479" style="s2">don&#39;t use force when they intervene so</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.889" end="01:16:02.789" style="s2">when they intervene it&#39;s impartial and</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.479" end="01:16:04.170" style="s2">they they generally use if any very low</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.789" end="01:16:06.749" style="s2">levels of gresham like not much more</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.170" end="01:16:08.280" style="s2">than a threat now they do one hand they</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.749" end="01:16:09.749" style="s2">don&#39;t need to but you know if you look</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.280" end="01:16:11.099" style="s2">at old sociological theories of power</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.749" end="01:16:13.619" style="s2">and one of the big influences I mean</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.099" end="01:16:16.650" style="s2">this guy Bierstadt wrote some very nice</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.619" end="01:16:18.989" style="s2">work on power and what it is some of the</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.650" end="01:16:21.150" style="s2">cleanest perspective on that that I read</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.989" end="01:16:23.219" style="s2">quite widely in that literature when you</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.150" end="01:16:25.679" style="s2">use power you risk losing it that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.219" end="01:16:27.389" style="s2">sort of thing and another is that you</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.679" end="01:16:28.679" style="s2">know it&#39;s a credibility thing so these</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.389" end="01:16:31.769" style="s2">individuals are out in the talent and</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.679" end="01:16:33.539" style="s2">they&#39;re the the they&#39;re out there</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.769" end="01:16:36.239" style="s2">because of the collective dynamics and</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.539" end="01:16:38.219" style="s2">what and and to some extent choice made</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.239" end="01:16:41.459" style="s2">by the other individuals in the system</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.219" end="01:16:43.650" style="s2">so if they were abusing their position</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.459" end="01:16:45.719" style="s2">they probably would receive fewer</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.650" end="01:16:46.949" style="s2">signals because it would be avoided and</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.719" end="01:16:48.989" style="s2">so the opportunity give the signals</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.949" end="01:16:50.729" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be there and so they would</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.989" end="01:16:51.780" style="s2">actually accumulate they would have less</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.729" end="01:16:53.880" style="s2">power because they this</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.780" end="01:16:56.280" style="s2">girls are key to them the key to the</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.880" end="01:16:58.050" style="s2">stability of their power right so this</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.280" end="01:17:00.300" style="s2">is a really sort of important point like</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.050" end="01:17:02.460" style="s2">they they will they risk losing power</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.300" end="01:17:04.530" style="s2">when they use force in these contexts</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.460" end="01:17:06.150" style="s2">that&#39;s one and then another is to some</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.530" end="01:17:07.350" style="s2">extent the signaling dynamics is really</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.150" end="01:17:08.730" style="s2">like voting in the human case where</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.350" end="01:17:11.730" style="s2">you&#39;re making a choice for one leader</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.730" end="01:17:13.800" style="s2">over another and you could you know</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.730" end="01:17:15.630" style="s2">influence that outcome by avoiding and</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.800" end="01:17:16.920" style="s2">not giving the signals and you get you</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.630" end="01:17:19.020" style="s2">see that quite clearly in chimpanzee</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.920" end="01:17:20.760" style="s2">groups where unlike the macaques and</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.020" end="01:17:22.410" style="s2">remember in one group at Yerkes there</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.760" end="01:17:24.180" style="s2">was an alpha and a beta male so the beta</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.410" end="01:17:25.980" style="s2">male gave a subordination signals called</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.180" end="01:17:28.410" style="s2">a pant got in that case to the alpha</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.980" end="01:17:31.140" style="s2">male but the alpha male was very</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.410" end="01:17:32.460" style="s2">aggressive and so in the dyadic</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.140" end="01:17:33.990" style="s2">relationship between alpha and beta the</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.460" end="01:17:35.520" style="s2">beta had to give this signal but the</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.990" end="01:17:37.410" style="s2">rest of the group did not like and so</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.520" end="01:17:39.450" style="s2">alpha is defined by receiving a signal</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.410" end="01:17:41.190" style="s2">from everybody else but the most</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.450" end="01:17:44.100" style="s2">powerful individual in the group is the</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.190" end="01:17:46.050" style="s2">beta male so the beta male even though</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.100" end="01:17:48.360" style="s2">he gives a bank run to the alpha male</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.050" end="01:17:49.860" style="s2">receives more pant grounds from a larger</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.360" end="01:17:52.590" style="s2">or more diverse group of individuals</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.860" end="01:17:54.780" style="s2">than the alpha male receipt and was so</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.590" end="01:17:56.490" style="s2">we said that beta male was the one who</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.780" end="01:17:57.690" style="s2">was perceived to be the most powerful</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.490" end="01:17:58.980" style="s2">individual in the group even though</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.690" end="01:18:00.450" style="s2">technically the alpha male is the one</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.980" end="01:18:01.950" style="s2">that receives Pankratz for everyone and</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.450" end="01:18:04.920" style="s2">what you would actually see the chimps</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.950" end="01:18:07.980" style="s2">doing is they would pass by the alpha</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.920" end="01:18:09.780" style="s2">male and in within his sight his field</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.980" end="01:18:11.910" style="s2">of vision they would give in this sort</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.780" end="01:18:13.890" style="s2">of very irreverent way Pankratz to the</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.910" end="01:18:15.180" style="s2">beta male uh-huh we&#39;re moving pan</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.890" end="01:18:16.920" style="s2">currents to the alpha male and so it</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.180" end="01:18:18.690" style="s2">really I mean I didn&#39;t I never published</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.920" end="01:18:20.160" style="s2">a papers incident I&#39;m up data and so</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.690" end="01:18:21.690" style="s2">this is this is a little bit speculative</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.160" end="01:18:23.520" style="s2">but it did really seem like a choice in</p>

<p begin="01:18:23.520" end="01:18:26.970" style="s2">voting they were like saying look I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.320" end="01:18:29.250" style="s2">not voting for you I&#39;ll give you a bank</p>

<p begin="01:18:29.250" end="01:18:33.120" style="s2">voting for you I prefer this guy whose</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.470" end="01:18:35.490" style="s2">interventions are you know more</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.120" end="01:18:37.170" style="s2">diplomatic actually and who&#39;s who&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.490" end="01:18:39.210" style="s2">better manager of the sort of groups</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.170" end="01:18:42.600" style="s2">social interactions and you are who uses</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.210" end="01:18:46.170" style="s2">force too much so really interesting</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.600" end="01:18:49.170" style="s2">stuff and so I you know I mean this this</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.170" end="01:18:50.640" style="s2">notion of of power and how you maintain</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.170" end="01:18:53.550" style="s2">it and how you use it I think it needs</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.640" end="01:18:54.960" style="s2">you needs a lot of careful thought yeah</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.550" end="01:18:56.970" style="s2">it sounds like we take that model it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.960" end="01:18:59.880" style="s2">an argument for kind of self-organizing</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.970" end="01:19:02.940" style="s2">network based authority as opposed to</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.880" end="01:19:05.579" style="s2">top-down role based Authority yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.940" end="01:19:07.770" style="s2">mean it can become top-down if there</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.579" end="01:19:10.260" style="s2">if you develop institutions and norms</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.770" end="01:19:12.210" style="s2">and rules that allow it it comes back to</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.260" end="01:19:14.909" style="s2">the slow variable point it make it hard</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.210" end="01:19:16.530" style="s2">to change right it effectively trans</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.909" end="01:19:18.079" style="s2">transitions into something that is</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.530" end="01:19:21.119" style="s2">top-down even if it started bottom-up</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.079" end="01:19:23.159" style="s2">yep let&#39;s move on to our next we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.119" end="01:19:25.170" style="s2">getting close to our time line so it</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.159" end="01:19:27.420" style="s2">will be one of our last maybe not the</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.170" end="01:19:28.889" style="s2">last you&#39;ve dug as deeply as anybody I</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.420" end="01:19:32.099" style="s2">know into what might be called the</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.889" end="01:19:34.409" style="s2">foundations of complexity assigned times</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.099" end="01:19:36.270" style="s2">warn folks that complexity science is</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.409" end="01:19:38.880" style="s2">still a baby science now I will say</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.270" end="01:19:40.860" style="s2">since I&#39;ve dug deep deeply into it</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.880" end="01:19:43.889" style="s2">myself spent at least 10 years and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.860" end="01:19:46.590" style="s2">sure lots happened is it still true that</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.889" end="01:19:48.599" style="s2">the plexy science is a baby science and</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.590" end="01:19:50.940" style="s2">if so what do you think the next area is</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.599" end="01:19:54.570" style="s2">where foundations might become solid or</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.940" end="01:19:56.699" style="s2">will they ever well I mean I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.570" end="01:19:58.290" style="s2">definitely still compared to physics for</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.699" end="01:20:00.090" style="s2">example definitely still early days and</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.290" end="01:20:01.770" style="s2">and then there&#39;s a distinction too</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.090" end="01:20:03.510" style="s2">between you know people working in</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.770" end="01:20:05.610" style="s2">complexity science maybe some</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.510" end="01:20:08.280" style="s2">theoretical biology and so forth and the</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.610" end="01:20:10.739" style="s2">rest of biology and Social Sciences in</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.280" end="01:20:12.599" style="s2">particular and so things might be moving</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.739" end="01:20:15.119" style="s2">kind of fast within complexity science</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.599" end="01:20:16.679" style="s2">but they it&#39;s not the results and</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.119" end="01:20:18.809" style="s2">approaches and way of think ways of</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.679" end="01:20:21.270" style="s2">thinking still haven&#39;t spread as far as</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.809" end="01:20:23.480" style="s2">they need to so I can still go to a</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.270" end="01:20:27.210" style="s2">biology department and give a talk and</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.480" end="01:20:29.159" style="s2">find you know that they&#39;ve never walked</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.210" end="01:20:30.900" style="s2">over to a physics department or you know</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.159" end="01:20:32.550" style="s2">the idea of using maximum entropy</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.900" end="01:20:34.650" style="s2">framework or even you know an Ising</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.550" end="01:20:37.530" style="s2">model to study you know a biological</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.650" end="01:20:38.909" style="s2">system seems silly and it sometimes it</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.530" end="01:20:41.760" style="s2">is silly because it&#39;s it&#39;s their use</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.909" end="01:20:43.650" style="s2">inappropriately or without any attention</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.760" end="01:20:45.719" style="s2">to mechanism but yeah so there are these</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.650" end="01:20:47.940" style="s2">there they&#39;re definitely still sort of</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.719" end="01:20:49.469" style="s2">like it&#39;s it&#39;s um the future is it</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.940" end="01:20:51.630" style="s2">what&#39;s the expression the future is here</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.469" end="01:20:53.639" style="s2">but it&#39;s not evenly distributed for</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.630" end="01:20:54.780" style="s2">complexity sign so that&#39;s one issue but</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.639" end="01:20:57.540" style="s2">then in terms of the topics and the</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.780" end="01:20:59.099" style="s2">questions you know I always tell people</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.540" end="01:21:01.739" style="s2">at the public lectures and in the summer</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.099" end="01:21:04.139" style="s2">school talks that we sort of have two</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.739" end="01:21:05.730" style="s2">types of talks at these at the summer</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.139" end="01:21:07.949" style="s2">school and in public lectures to some</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.730" end="01:21:09.210" style="s2">extent the one type of talk is the kind</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.949" end="01:21:10.710" style="s2">of on the complexity science stuff</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.210" end="01:21:12.929" style="s2">that&#39;s now been around for a while and</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.710" end="01:21:15.270" style="s2">on which there are textbooks so for</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.929" end="01:21:16.800" style="s2">example Network science and some</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.270" end="01:21:19.159" style="s2">theoretical computer science and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.800" end="01:21:22.099" style="s2">you know dynamical systems</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.159" end="01:21:24.769" style="s2">Seagal is Bradley and Chris more</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.099" end="01:21:25.999" style="s2">Rainey&#39;s book on computation coming from</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.769" end="01:21:28.280" style="s2">theoretical computer science</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.999" end="01:21:29.719" style="s2">computational biology now competition by</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.280" end="01:21:32.539" style="s2">biological systems which is what we do</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.719" end="01:21:34.219" style="s2">and you get you know Mark Newman doing</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.539" end="01:21:37.429" style="s2">this absolutely outstanding work on</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.219" end="01:21:39.559" style="s2">networks and that stuff is it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.429" end="01:21:41.479" style="s2">it&#39;s being hammered and it&#39;s it&#39;s gotten</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.559" end="01:21:43.010" style="s2">to the point where it&#39;s pedagogical so</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.479" end="01:21:44.689" style="s2">there&#39;s nice there&#39;s cool stuff on the</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.010" end="01:21:47.389" style="s2">horizon to do but you know there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.689" end="01:21:49.340" style="s2">a core of agreed-upon concepts and</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.389" end="01:21:51.010" style="s2">methods developed by these guys and can</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.340" end="01:21:54.949" style="s2">be conveyed in a fairly accessible</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.010" end="01:21:57.320" style="s2">pedagogical way to - you know we&#39;re jr.</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.949" end="01:21:58.909" style="s2">or or lay people and then there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.320" end="01:22:00.320" style="s2">other stuff and the other stuff tends to</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.909" end="01:22:01.519" style="s2">be more like at the borders as we were</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.320" end="01:22:03.769" style="s2">talking about earlier between philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.519" end="01:22:05.510" style="s2">and biology or you know just where the</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.769" end="01:22:06.860" style="s2">questions are where the where the all</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.510" end="01:22:08.719" style="s2">the currency is in working out the</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.860" end="01:22:10.070" style="s2">question and in taking that question and</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.719" end="01:22:12.439" style="s2">making it amenable to modeling and</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.070" end="01:22:14.929" style="s2">theory and and and and gathering data</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.439" end="01:22:17.599" style="s2">and that&#39;s where another group of</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.929" end="01:22:19.130" style="s2">researchers sit is in that space and</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.599" end="01:22:20.659" style="s2">certainly like my work and Dave&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.130" end="01:22:22.459" style="s2">sits there and then the collective</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.659" end="01:22:25.189" style="s2">commentation stuff that we do you know</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.459" end="01:22:26.689" style="s2">that as you numerated as I often do that</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.189" end="01:22:28.939" style="s2">long list of disciplines that informs</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.689" end="01:22:31.070" style="s2">collective computation maybe in one or</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.939" end="01:22:33.619" style="s2">two of those disciplines do I know you</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.070" end="01:22:35.630" style="s2">know as much as my peers maybe one of</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.619" end="01:22:37.519" style="s2">them in most of them I am you know I</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.630" end="01:22:39.050" style="s2">really don&#39;t know that much but I know a</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.519" end="01:22:40.459" style="s2">lot about collective computation and I</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.050" end="01:22:41.360" style="s2">know a lot and increasingly a lot about</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.459" end="01:22:42.919" style="s2">how it relates to ideas about</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.360" end="01:22:45.289" style="s2">computation in theoretical computer</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.919" end="01:22:47.360" style="s2">science and so this thing that I study</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.289" end="01:22:49.219" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it&#39;s at this in this</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.360" end="01:22:50.869" style="s2">liminal space use a word you use earlier</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.219" end="01:22:52.579" style="s2">that I quite like it sits in this</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.869" end="01:22:53.659" style="s2">liminal space is this sort of</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.579" end="01:22:55.280" style="s2">intersection between many different</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.659" end="01:22:57.289" style="s2">fields and you have to be very</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.280" end="01:22:58.669" style="s2">comfortable drawing from those fields</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.289" end="01:23:00.139" style="s2">and working with collaborators is super</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.669" end="01:23:02.719" style="s2">important you know more about those</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.139" end="01:23:04.249" style="s2">fields than you do and you know being</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.719" end="01:23:05.719" style="s2">comfortable not knowing everything and</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.249" end="01:23:07.699" style="s2">that&#39;s general general featured being in</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.719" end="01:23:10.189" style="s2">SFI in order to make progress on these</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.699" end="01:23:11.869" style="s2">new in these new areas and so I think</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.189" end="01:23:14.090" style="s2">there&#39;s a number of new areas like</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.869" end="01:23:15.979" style="s2">another one is the thermodynamics of</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.090" end="01:23:17.269" style="s2">computation that&#39;s that&#39;s adjacent to</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.979" end="01:23:20.989" style="s2">collect a conversation that people like</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.269" end="01:23:22.369" style="s2">David walpert work on and then they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.989" end="01:23:24.709" style="s2">and they&#39;re building on old ideas a</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.369" end="01:23:26.620" style="s2">testify but they&#39;re they feel new again</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.709" end="01:23:30.490" style="s2">they feel new and</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.620" end="01:23:31.540" style="s2">you know and I&#39;m very young and and so</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.490" end="01:23:34.150" style="s2">I&#39;m always trying to convey to people</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.540" end="01:23:35.800" style="s2">you know the difference in the talks and</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.150" end="01:23:37.090" style="s2">the summer school talks like here you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.800" end="01:23:38.560" style="s2">going to be exposed to this new set of</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.090" end="01:23:40.540" style="s2">ideas it&#39;s not well worked out the</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.560" end="01:23:41.230" style="s2">person giving the talk does not know all</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.540" end="01:23:43.150" style="s2">the answers</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.230" end="01:23:44.560" style="s2">maybe knows more of the questions and</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.150" end="01:23:45.820" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna be exposed to some or</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.560" end="01:23:48.490" style="s2">pedagogical stuff and you shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.820" end="01:23:50.140" style="s2">confuse the two very good wonderful</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.490" end="01:23:52.540" style="s2">distinction you guys like friends is the</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.140" end="01:23:54.010" style="s2">network science work of like Mark Newman</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.540" end="01:23:55.690" style="s2">which has a really good book called</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.010" end="01:23:57.520" style="s2">networks I think or something like that</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.690" end="01:23:58.990" style="s2">that&#39;s a good example one that&#39;s well</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.520" end="01:24:00.700" style="s2">worked out and then a lot of the rest of</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.990" end="01:24:01.690" style="s2">this stuff is still working progress and</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.700" end="01:24:04.090" style="s2">that&#39;s probably a good way to think</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.690" end="01:24:06.310" style="s2">about it so here&#39;s our last question you</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.090" end="01:24:09.100" style="s2">spent thousands of hours with primates</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.310" end="01:24:11.170" style="s2">of various sorts and I&#39;ve long been</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.100" end="01:24:13.180" style="s2">fascinated by the idea that we have such</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.170" end="01:24:15.280" style="s2">close relatives here on earth what do we</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.180" end="01:24:16.750" style="s2">think between us and chimps it&#39;s 1% one</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.280" end="01:24:19.720" style="s2">and a half percent difference in genes</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.750" end="01:24:21.610" style="s2">something like that and frankly I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.720" end="01:24:23.680" style="s2">saddened in a pretty deep way about</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.610" end="01:24:25.420" style="s2">their fate in the wild you spent</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.680" end="01:24:28.270" style="s2">thousands of hours with them what are</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.420" end="01:24:32.350" style="s2">chimps like and other primates what are</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.270" end="01:24:33.370" style="s2">they like you know so I when I was in</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.350" end="01:24:34.960" style="s2">graduate school is in the group of</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.370" end="01:24:36.040" style="s2">friends Duvall and Franz had he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.960" end="01:24:38.590" style="s2">famous that he&#39;s a famous Dutch</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.040" end="01:24:40.390" style="s2">pathologist and Franz would make this</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.590" end="01:24:42.400" style="s2">point and I think it&#39;s just so important</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.390" end="01:24:43.990" style="s2">and that is when he would hire like a</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.400" end="01:24:46.000" style="s2">graduate student or someone to you know</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.990" end="01:24:48.640" style="s2">attack to get to help collect data on</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.000" end="01:24:50.830" style="s2">the monkeys whether are the chimps tax</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.640" end="01:24:52.000" style="s2">rates one of the questions he&#39;d asked</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.830" end="01:24:53.770" style="s2">after they spent a couple days up there</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.000" end="01:24:54.970" style="s2">on the tower is you know what do you</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.770" end="01:24:57.550" style="s2">think of the animals what did you think</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.970" end="01:24:59.140" style="s2">of you know monkeys in the group or the</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.550" end="01:25:00.780" style="s2">chimps and if they said oh I love them</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.140" end="01:25:03.760" style="s2">all they went out and they weren&#39;t hired</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.780" end="01:25:07.060" style="s2">right so one of the first you know of</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.760" end="01:25:08.980" style="s2">points Franz mean would I he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.060" end="01:25:10.990" style="s2">incredible I insight about social</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.980" end="01:25:12.880" style="s2">dynamics and individuals and individual</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.990" end="01:25:14.350" style="s2">behavior and so forth this is that just</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.880" end="01:25:15.640" style="s2">like in human groups they&#39;re you know</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.350" end="01:25:17.740" style="s2">there&#39;s this incredible heterogeneity</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.640" end="01:25:19.330" style="s2">and they have complex personalities and</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.740" end="01:25:22.300" style="s2">very interesting social structures and</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.330" end="01:25:23.740" style="s2">if you don&#39;t see that then you know you</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.300" end="01:25:25.570" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be anthologies you should be</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.740" end="01:25:27.280" style="s2">collecting these data and so the chimps</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.570" end="01:25:30.100" style="s2">to be honest like there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.280" end="01:25:32.050" style="s2">variability in how likable chimps are</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.100" end="01:25:33.970" style="s2">there are some extremely likeable chimps</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.050" end="01:25:36.730" style="s2">and and very intelligent ones or others</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.970" end="01:25:38.620" style="s2">that are quite Machiavellian and just</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.730" end="01:25:39.040" style="s2">never seem happy and you know I mean</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.620" end="01:25:41.620" style="s2">just like</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.040" end="01:25:43.570" style="s2">I see the you know the full range there</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.620" end="01:25:47.410" style="s2">as well I mean a little lesser in the</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.570" end="01:25:50.590" style="s2">macaque but but there too and so chimps</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.410" end="01:25:52.450" style="s2">I mean there&#39;s this stereotype chimps</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.590" end="01:25:53.920" style="s2">you know are the aggressive hierarchical</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.450" end="01:25:56.320" style="s2">ones and vinolas are the sort of you</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.920" end="01:25:57.940" style="s2">know free love egalitarian ones and</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.320" end="01:25:59.740" style="s2">these distinctions are of course they</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.940" end="01:26:01.330" style="s2">are stereotypes and they&#39;re amplified a</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.740" end="01:26:02.800" style="s2">little bit by the politics within the</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.330" end="01:26:04.540" style="s2">animal behavior community of who study</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.800" end="01:26:06.220" style="s2">you know the randoms of the world from</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.540" end="01:26:07.900" style="s2">ring ups at Harvard and the Franz&#39;s of</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.220" end="01:26:09.760" style="s2">the world or the thomas ellis and their</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.900" end="01:26:11.110" style="s2">particular viewpoints on things but</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.760" end="01:26:12.850" style="s2">there is something to these distinctions</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.110" end="01:26:14.260" style="s2">and it&#39;s and it&#39;s not necessarily that</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.850" end="01:26:15.700" style="s2">these distinctions are have a genetic</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.260" end="01:26:16.900" style="s2">basis they might have some genetic basis</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.700" end="01:26:18.760" style="s2">but there are distinctions that get</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.900" end="01:26:20.650" style="s2">amplified by social structure and to</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.760" end="01:26:23.500" style="s2">give you an example of references story</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.650" end="01:26:26.050" style="s2">by Robert Sapolsky Sapolsky is a sort of</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.500" end="01:26:30.670" style="s2">a neuroscientist who works on cortisol</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.050" end="01:26:32.530" style="s2">and and stress and health and and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.670" end="01:26:34.240" style="s2">done primate work and studied sort of</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.530" end="01:26:36.370" style="s2">the role of cortisol and serotonin and</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.240" end="01:26:40.000" style="s2">other things in behavior and dominance</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.370" end="01:26:41.440" style="s2">and related phenomena and he studied for</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.000" end="01:26:42.730" style="s2">a while yet a field site in Kenya and I</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.440" end="01:26:43.870" style="s2">I thought about going there and working</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.730" end="01:26:45.040" style="s2">with him I was in grad school but I</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.870" end="01:26:46.870" style="s2">remember he had this great story so</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.040" end="01:26:48.460" style="s2">these these groups of baboons at this</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.870" end="01:26:51.100" style="s2">fields the two groups of baboons I think</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.460" end="01:26:51.970" style="s2">and there&#39;s a garbage dump and in these</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.100" end="01:26:54.340" style="s2">groups of everyone&#39;s there are these</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.970" end="01:26:56.020" style="s2">very aggressive dominant males and they</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.340" end="01:26:58.720" style="s2">they weren&#39;t the type of males who</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.020" end="01:27:00.850" style="s2">according to the story who you know</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.720" end="01:27:02.320" style="s2">modulated their power they abused it</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.850" end="01:27:04.750" style="s2">regularly and so there probably was a</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.320" end="01:27:09.400" style="s2">fair bit of change but these aggressive</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.750" end="01:27:11.110" style="s2">males of course you know by rights got</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.400" end="01:27:13.440" style="s2">access to the food at this garbage dump</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.110" end="01:27:15.760" style="s2">and they got tuberculosis they died</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.440" end="01:27:17.860" style="s2">nobody else ate the garbage and so what</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.760" end="01:27:19.570" style="s2">this left it&#39;s left is this culture in</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.860" end="01:27:21.280" style="s2">this group it were left the only animals</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.570" end="01:27:22.690" style="s2">at left were these sort of docile as he</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.280" end="01:27:25.680" style="s2">you know supposed to really as a story</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.690" end="01:27:28.560" style="s2">he&#39;s docile less aggressive males and</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.680" end="01:27:32.340" style="s2">the social culture of the baboons</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.560" end="01:27:35.080" style="s2">changed and the interesting question was</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.340" end="01:27:37.870" style="s2">well was it just gonna last as long as</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.080" end="01:27:38.200" style="s2">these young males then became bigger and</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.870" end="01:27:41.260" style="s2">older</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.200" end="01:27:42.820" style="s2">lived or would it be culturally</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.260" end="01:27:44.530" style="s2">inherited were and maybe there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.820" end="01:27:46.420" style="s2">gene expression issues and so forth and</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.530" end="01:27:47.800" style="s2">in according to Sapolsky was so the next</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.420" end="01:27:52.030" style="s2">generation after these younger males</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.800" end="01:27:52.599" style="s2">also maintained these social norms so to</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.030" end="01:27:54.310" style="s2">speak</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.599" end="01:27:58.090" style="s2">the style of interaction they had with</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.310" end="01:28:00.130" style="s2">other animals and so you know the chimps</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.090" end="01:28:01.329" style="s2">are more aggressive they do seem to be</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.130" end="01:28:03.070" style="s2">more aggressive maybe I&#39;m a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.329" end="01:28:04.119" style="s2">more hierarchical then say the bonobos</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.070" end="01:28:06.760" style="s2">but I think this is a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.119" end="01:28:08.920" style="s2">overstated and also also it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.760" end="01:28:10.570" style="s2">necessarily you know just a kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.920" end="01:28:12.130" style="s2">specie specific thing there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.570" end="01:28:13.869" style="s2">plasticity and social structure and</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.130" end="01:28:16.780" style="s2">coming back to that downward causation</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.869" end="01:28:18.940" style="s2">behaviors get reinforced by this sort of</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.780" end="01:28:21.010" style="s2">norms and institutions that are in place</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.940" end="01:28:23.079" style="s2">and when those change when the mechanism</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.010" end="01:28:23.619" style="s2">or context arises for those things to</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.079" end="01:28:25.210" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.619" end="01:28:27.670" style="s2">you can get big changes in the system</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.210" end="01:28:29.469" style="s2">and that brings us full circle to the</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.670" end="01:28:31.329" style="s2">emergent our social engineering</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.469" end="01:28:34.719" style="s2">questions you asked earlier like how do</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.329" end="01:28:36.940" style="s2">we intervene who do we remove what</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.719" end="01:28:38.380" style="s2">behavioral changes we want to induce you</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.940" end="01:28:40.389" style="s2">know what&#39;s what&#39;s the right way to get</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.380" end="01:28:42.099" style="s2">a different social structure to move</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.389" end="01:28:43.960" style="s2">from a more despotic society to a</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.099" end="01:28:46.449" style="s2">hierarchical one and I think by having</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.960" end="01:28:47.800" style="s2">these more informed micro to macro maps</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.449" end="01:28:49.060" style="s2">or information processing systems we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.800" end="01:28:51.250" style="s2">will be in a better position to do that</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.060" end="01:28:53.440" style="s2">and so there&#39;s a long answer to your</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.250" end="01:28:54.909" style="s2">what is butter chimps like they&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.440" end="01:28:57.250" style="s2">know they&#39;re like their social structure</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.909" end="01:29:00.070" style="s2">demands to some extent and to some</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.250" end="01:29:01.869" style="s2">extent what their genetics give them but</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.070" end="01:29:03.340" style="s2">you shouldn&#39;t discount a one shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.869" end="01:29:05.500" style="s2">discount the importance of social</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.340" end="01:29:06.849" style="s2">structure and and social institutions in</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.500" end="01:29:10.570" style="s2">animal societies the behavior that we</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.849" end="01:29:14.829" style="s2">see and I would add humans as well oh of</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.570" end="01:29:17.260" style="s2">course yeah indeed well that was I think</p>
