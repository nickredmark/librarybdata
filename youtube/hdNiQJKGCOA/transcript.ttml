<p begin="00:02:01.810" end="00:02:05.650" style="s2">because I didn&#39;t know I thought</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.550" end="00:02:08.470" style="s2">something interesting would just pop up</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.650" end="00:02:11.410" style="s2">that we might miss I&#39;ve been I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.470" end="00:02:13.180" style="s2">studying the Kushan Empire quite a lot</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.410" end="00:02:14.170" style="s2">recently I find it incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.180" end="00:02:16.120" style="s2">interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.170" end="00:02:18.130" style="s2">and I think a reason why we have</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.120" end="00:02:19.990" style="s2">underrated the Kushan Empire in Europe</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.130" end="00:02:22.630" style="s2">is because this was of course the Golden</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.990" end="00:02:24.670" style="s2">Age of the Roman Empire so you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.630" end="00:02:26.920" style="s2">about a hundred years before Christ</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.670" end="00:02:31.180" style="s2">until what three or four hundred years</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.920" end="00:02:33.940" style="s2">later the Cutrone&#39;s had invaded from</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.180" end="00:02:36.010" style="s2">Central Asia and occupied northern India</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.940" end="00:02:37.930" style="s2">it was the only empire that actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.010" end="00:02:42.310" style="s2">encapsulated both of India and most of</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.930" end="00:02:45.280" style="s2">Persia any incredibly Golden Age for</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.310" end="00:02:46.840" style="s2">Buddhism and Zoroastrianism met both</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.280" end="00:02:49.090" style="s2">state religions within the cushion</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.840" end="00:02:50.980" style="s2">Empire and obviously what we talked</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.090" end="00:02:53.470" style="s2">about before you and I about the silk</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.980" end="00:02:57.850" style="s2">trade triad was really established this</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.470" end="00:03:00.640" style="s2">sort of fruitful relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.850" end="00:03:03.340" style="s2">Taoism and Buddhism and so Astor&#39;s must</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.640" end="00:03:04.690" style="s2">in between the person the Chinese and</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.340" end="00:03:06.430" style="s2">the Indian religions and of course</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.690" end="00:03:11.019" style="s2">Tibetan Buddhism the you a narrative</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.430" end="00:03:12.370" style="s2">there&#39;s a salt of these marriages so you</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.019" end="00:03:14.140" style="s2">know people traveled I mean they were</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.370" end="00:03:16.989" style="s2">nomadic and it says people came from</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.140" end="00:03:18.880" style="s2">Mongolia peacefully all the way down to</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.989" end="00:03:21.070" style="s2">India and integrated with the Indians</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.880" end="00:03:22.769" style="s2">during this time and then spread of</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.070" end="00:03:26.110" style="s2">course Buddhism the other way eventually</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.769" end="00:03:27.549" style="s2">Hinduism took back anymore but Buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.110" end="00:03:30.040" style="s2">on the other hand was spread along the</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.549" end="00:03:32.110" style="s2">Silk Road over the rest of Asia and it</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.040" end="00:03:34.150" style="s2">intermarried with Zoroastrianism and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.110" end="00:03:36.130" style="s2">think an important thing we need to</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.150" end="00:03:38.860" style="s2">start studying there&#39;s some scholars</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.130" end="00:03:41.290" style="s2">some Asian scholars working in America</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.860" end="00:03:44.170" style="s2">they started studying if this could also</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.290" end="00:03:46.180" style="s2">possibly be the route of Sufism now of</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.170" end="00:03:48.910" style="s2">course this is a really really touchy</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.180" end="00:03:50.920" style="s2">subject because awesomes cannot make up</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.910" end="00:03:53.560" style="s2">the mind what they want include Sufism</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.920" end="00:03:56.019" style="s2">or not this versus one includes Sufism</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.560" end="00:03:59.519" style="s2">in Islam when it pays off well I know</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.019" end="00:04:02.739" style="s2">Sufis that say that Sufism is pre Muslim</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.519" end="00:04:04.989" style="s2">it is absolutely yes it is absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.739" end="00:04:07.000" style="s2">and there seems to be two different</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.989" end="00:04:10.420" style="s2">schools that could both turn out to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.000" end="00:04:12.730" style="s2">right there&#39;s a Kurdish school it seems</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.420" end="00:04:15.489" style="s2">to locate the origin of Sufism in</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.730" end="00:04:18.250" style="s2">Mesopotamia which is of course person</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.489" end="00:04:20.500" style="s2">before the Arabs invaded I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.250" end="00:04:22.690" style="s2">Persian Empire did the capital was Tessa</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.500" end="00:04:24.039" style="s2">form which is basically now a server</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.690" end="00:04:26.320" style="s2">suburb of Baghdad</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.039" end="00:04:27.850" style="s2">so the original bag that is Persian so</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.320" end="00:04:30.340" style="s2">so the person&#39;s bill</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.850" end="00:04:32.530" style="s2">Baghdad or Stephon it&#39;s called which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.340" end="00:04:33.790" style="s2">the capital of the Persian Empire this</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.530" end="00:04:36.010" style="s2">desert was then fighting</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.790" end="00:04:38.500" style="s2">be songs which ironically been the</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.010" end="00:04:40.390" style="s2">capital of Roman Empire the Roman Empire</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.500" end="00:04:43.330" style="s2">moved its capital to the east away from</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.390" end="00:04:46.510" style="s2">Rome to Constantinople or basalts and</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.330" end="00:04:48.940" style="s2">the Persian capital moved from central</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.510" end="00:04:51.130" style="s2">Persia and Persepolis onto steady form</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.940" end="00:04:52.960" style="s2">which is contemporary Baghdad and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.130" end="00:04:54.430" style="s2">became to connect with the personal and</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.960" end="00:04:56.140" style="s2">the Persian Empire the Roman Emperor</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.430" end="00:04:58.230" style="s2">basically you know were the two major</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.140" end="00:05:00.490" style="s2">empires and this was a struggle between</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.230" end="00:05:02.230" style="s2">Christianity and so astron ISM while</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.490" end="00:05:03.670" style="s2">there was still at least Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.230" end="00:05:06.630" style="s2">was still being formed and was still</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.670" end="00:05:09.670" style="s2">under a lot of influence and this war</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.630" end="00:05:12.100" style="s2">exhausted both Pershing Roman it</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.670" end="00:05:14.650" style="s2">exhausted boast as if on Amazon&#39;s and it</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.100" end="00:05:17.170" style="s2">did so most of all because of a huge</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.650" end="00:05:19.120" style="s2">plague that hit Europe in the 6th</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.170" end="00:05:20.920" style="s2">century there were two major plates the</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.120" end="00:05:22.450" style="s2">first one was in the 6th century and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.920" end="00:05:24.840" style="s2">second one the one we usually hear about</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.450" end="00:05:26.620" style="s2">it so in the 14th century and the most</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.840" end="00:05:28.690" style="s2">devastated the Middle East and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.620" end="00:05:31.450" style="s2">devastated Europe but the plague in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.690" end="00:05:33.640" style="s2">6th century evaporated you know but</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.450" end="00:05:35.380" style="s2">somewhere between the third or half of</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.640" end="00:05:37.450" style="s2">the Middle East population was wiped out</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.380" end="00:05:39.100" style="s2">the Persian Empire basically went</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.450" end="00:05:41.290" style="s2">bankrupt because of the plague</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.100" end="00:05:43.870" style="s2">so ostensive own ambitions were still</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.290" end="00:05:45.490" style="s2">fighting each other this opened up the</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.870" end="00:05:48.070" style="s2">entire Middle East for just about</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.490" end="00:05:51.460" style="s2">anybody what years are we talking about</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.070" end="00:05:54.070" style="s2">here no 7 century are we still in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.460" end="00:05:56.260" style="s2">7th century ok this is everything so the</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.070" end="00:05:58.210" style="s2">6th century East when the playhead the</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.260" end="00:06:01.480" style="s2">seventies when you had the devastating</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.210" end="00:06:03.280" style="s2">results of a major plague in the Middle</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.480" end="00:06:05.500" style="s2">East in Europe the Middle East was even</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.280" end="00:06:07.840" style="s2">more weakened than Europe was so so this</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.500" end="00:06:09.730" style="s2">weekend especially for the person Empire</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.840" end="00:06:11.080" style="s2">was even more weakened this is the end</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.730" end="00:06:12.970" style="s2">of the Sassanid Empire</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.080" end="00:06:14.620" style="s2">so the Sassanid Empire certainly there</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.970" end="00:06:16.810" style="s2">was a little innovation coming from the</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.620" end="00:06:18.790" style="s2">south from places called Mecca and</p>

<p begin="00:12:36.769" end="00:12:41.480" style="s2">philosopher we gladly placed him in a</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.380" end="00:12:44.149" style="s2">new camp that we called philosophy and</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.480" end="00:12:46.100" style="s2">in the world of philosophy from the 16th</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.149" end="00:12:48.260" style="s2">century forward in the West you could</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.100" end="00:12:50.000" style="s2">think all kinds of weird and wicked and</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.260" end="00:12:52.220" style="s2">strange ideas without getting executed</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.000" end="00:12:54.800" style="s2">because you are a person philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.220" end="00:12:57.050" style="s2">this is a whole new academic discipline</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.800" end="00:12:58.970" style="s2">so you took it out of theology because</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.050" end="00:13:01.250" style="s2">if you stayed with in theology plague</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.970" end="00:13:04.100" style="s2">thinks it&#39;s a Catholic Church or at</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.250" end="00:13:06.589" style="s2">least Luther did not agree with you had</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.100" end="00:13:08.930" style="s2">your head chopped off okay but if you</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.589" end="00:13:10.850" style="s2">left theology and had no claims to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.930" end="00:13:12.860" style="s2">fortune of the church you could be</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.850" end="00:13:15.800" style="s2">philosopher you could think more freely</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.860" end="00:13:19.040" style="s2">but even with Spinoza it was his friend</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.800" end="00:13:20.960" style="s2">the cart alignments realized his genius</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.040" end="00:13:23.240" style="s2">and they were all you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.960" end="00:13:24.200" style="s2">contemporaries they defended his right</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.240" end="00:13:26.360" style="s2">to speak his mind</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.200" end="00:13:28.279" style="s2">so philosophers started speaking them</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.360" end="00:13:30.350" style="s2">you know for each other like no no no</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.279" end="00:13:32.570" style="s2">wait a second I&#39;m the car to have these</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.350" end="00:13:34.490" style="s2">ideas I&#39;m a duelist I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.570" end="00:13:35.930" style="s2">break with Christianity because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.490" end="00:13:38.240" style="s2">actually dualist and actually he took</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.930" end="00:13:40.190" style="s2">dualism to a whole new level I mean if</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.240" end="00:13:42.830" style="s2">anybody took dualism seriously it was</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.190" end="00:13:44.330" style="s2">the card so we the modern dualism we</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.830" end="00:13:45.860" style="s2">have in the West we inherited from a</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.330" end="00:13:48.380" style="s2">current and that&#39;s why I talk about</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.860" end="00:13:50.180" style="s2">Cartesian individualism and I call talk</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.380" end="00:13:53.060" style="s2">about Cartesian dualism of time but</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.180" end="00:13:55.910" style="s2">Spinoza introduced monism and in a weird</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.060" end="00:13:57.709" style="s2">way so did Lyman its except that he</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.910" end="00:13:58.430" style="s2">didn&#39;t really understand probably that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.709" end="00:14:00.410" style="s2">what he did</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.430" end="00:14:02.060" style="s2">Linus has been also much closer to each</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.410" end="00:14:03.830" style="s2">other and you have to read them next to</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.060" end="00:14:06.680" style="s2">each other now when you study them but I</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.830" end="00:14:10.850" style="s2">find it interesting that the kickstart</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.680" end="00:14:12.680" style="s2">in the West for a - tradition starting</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.850" end="00:14:15.920" style="s2">with Spinoza been being fulfilled by</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.680" end="00:14:18.620" style="s2">Hegel cetera starts with su v--&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.920" end="00:14:21.500" style="s2">could not have Spinoza unless his family</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.620" end="00:14:24.320" style="s2">had Portuguese Jewish origins in a</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.500" end="00:14:25.880" style="s2">billion Jews often accepted Sufi mystics</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.320" end="00:14:27.529" style="s2">and found them interesting and when the</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.880" end="00:14:29.600" style="s2">Jewish tradition you could of course be</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.529" end="00:14:31.700" style="s2">a mystic and as a mystic you could have</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.600" end="00:14:33.770" style="s2">sperm on ISM and you could you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.700" end="00:14:35.089" style="s2">think of your whole vows maybe being the</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.770" end="00:14:37.279" style="s2">universe or something you could</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.089" end="00:14:39.589" style="s2">definitely do with a law at least if you</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.279" end="00:14:41.450" style="s2">were a Sufi so we have to go back now</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.589" end="00:14:43.790" style="s2">and trace the origins of Sufism and I</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.450" end="00:14:45.860" style="s2">find incredibly interesting that we</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.790" end="00:14:47.690" style="s2">explore one I talked about it I talked</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.860" end="00:14:50.180" style="s2">about the Kurdish explanation which is</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.690" end="00:14:55.279" style="s2">no this started out in the bazaars or</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.180" end="00:14:57.410" style="s2">Basra and bonded so when Islam took over</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.279" end="00:15:00.140" style="s2">and Baghdad now became the new capital</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.410" end="00:15:02.240" style="s2">of the Arab world basically they just</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.140" end="00:15:04.459" style="s2">took over stessa phone from from the</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.240" end="00:15:05.839" style="s2">person&#39;s and said you know a few miles</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.459" end="00:15:07.459" style="s2">west of stessa phone we build a new</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.839" end="00:15:09.770" style="s2">capital on the tigress and we call it</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.459" end="00:15:11.510" style="s2">back you already had the masks as you</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.770" end="00:15:14.720" style="s2">were at Cairo so then you have three</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.510" end="00:15:16.730" style="s2">major huge urban centers in his family</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.720" end="00:15:19.220" style="s2">world and that led him to the Islamic</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.730" end="00:15:21.260" style="s2">Golden Age what he sent essentially the</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.220" end="00:15:23.209" style="s2">Egyptians and the Babylonians and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.260" end="00:15:25.100" style="s2">Mesopotamians and the Persians created</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.209" end="00:15:26.839" style="s2">the culture the Arabs claimed were there</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.100" end="00:15:29.630" style="s2">was there so this is the Muslim Golden</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.839" end="00:15:31.010" style="s2">Age so but I finally interesting so they</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.630" end="00:15:32.600" style="s2">said you claim that the Kurdish</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.010" end="00:15:34.400" style="s2">tradition could be the origin of Sufism</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.600" end="00:15:35.810" style="s2">the other claim</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.400" end="00:15:38.089" style="s2">is that it started in Central Asia</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.810" end="00:15:40.460" style="s2">you&#39;re out of your suit isn&#39;t right the</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.089" end="00:15:43.130" style="s2">local Kurdish religion that&#39;s non-muslim</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.460" end="00:15:44.390" style="s2">does it isn&#39;t really it&#39;s a folk version</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.130" end="00:15:46.790" style="s2">of Zoroastrianism and they are</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.390" end="00:15:48.920" style="s2">collaborating now so rest em ISM has</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.790" end="00:15:51.050" style="s2">been declared an official religion in</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.920" end="00:15:52.910" style="s2">neurotic Lorestan and of course a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.050" end="00:15:54.860" style="s2">Kurds are not that happy about being</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.910" end="00:15:56.510" style="s2">Muslims any longer after having being</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.860" end="00:15:59.089" style="s2">raped and pillaged by the Islamic state</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.510" end="00:16:01.100" style="s2">so there&#39;s a lot of conversions going on</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.089" end="00:16:03.050" style="s2">now in Iraq and Kurdistan in the convert</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.100" end="00:16:05.180" style="s2">to the reston ISM and they can also keep</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.050" end="00:16:07.850" style="s2">the UCD practices because that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.180" end="00:16:09.710" style="s2">considered the focus or s tourism so it</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.850" end="00:16:12.140" style="s2">is our master</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.710" end="00:16:14.870" style="s2">it is Zoroastrianism all around and this</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.140" end="00:16:16.580" style="s2">again why can&#39;t you grow tourism is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.870" end="00:16:19.580" style="s2">connection between the two is that we</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.580" end="00:16:20.900" style="s2">don&#39;t see a single single example of</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.580" end="00:16:25.100" style="s2">conflict between Zoroastrians and</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.900" end="00:16:27.080" style="s2">buddhists until this day to me the yin</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.100" end="00:16:29.120" style="s2">and yang they just are just like so</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.080" end="00:16:31.490" style="s2">closely connected but they&#39;re just two</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.120" end="00:16:34.220" style="s2">different radically different sides of</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.490" end="00:16:36.980" style="s2">the same coin so to me Zoroastrianism</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.220" end="00:16:38.720" style="s2">it&#39;s the phallic version of an religion</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.980" end="00:16:40.610" style="s2">where the magical version of that</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.720" end="00:16:42.550" style="s2">religion is Buddhism and it&#39;s more like</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.610" end="00:16:44.570" style="s2">you and me it&#39;s a it&#39;s a matter of taste</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.550" end="00:16:46.459" style="s2">why do you want to call yourself a</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.570" end="00:16:48.250" style="s2">Buddhist or as arrest you mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.459" end="00:16:51.770" style="s2">actually complement each other perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.250" end="00:16:54.589" style="s2">Taoism you&#39;ve tried to unify the two</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.770" end="00:16:56.450" style="s2">into one religion but this is something</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.589" end="00:16:58.190" style="s2">brilliant about actually keeping two</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.450" end="00:17:00.560" style="s2">religions separate within the same</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.190" end="00:17:02.390" style="s2">Empire it can actually more fruitful and</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.560" end="00:17:05.540" style="s2">I think that&#39;s exactly what they did in</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.390" end="00:17:08.089" style="s2">the Kushan Empire the cushions came from</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.540" end="00:17:09.559" style="s2">Central Asia what is it can I ask you</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.089" end="00:17:11.689" style="s2">question before you going off the story</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.559" end="00:17:15.459" style="s2">wait why do you think why do you think</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.689" end="00:17:18.199" style="s2">the asterism is phallic and Buddhism is</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.459" end="00:17:20.689" style="s2">make sure our color perhaps tourism is</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.199" end="00:17:22.939" style="s2">all about linear history it&#39;s all about</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.689" end="00:17:26.089" style="s2">we started here and we&#39;re gonna build an</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.939" end="00:17:28.280" style="s2">amazing glorious future up there on the</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.089" end="00:17:30.590" style="s2">hill so we&#39;re gonna take humanity and</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.280" end="00:17:32.990" style="s2">build a civilization and we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.590" end="00:17:35.170" style="s2">shut ourselves in the world by creating</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.990" end="00:17:37.850" style="s2">an amazing future together</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.170" end="00:17:40.400" style="s2">completely finally and it&#39;s not about</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.850" end="00:17:42.830" style="s2">having been in a paradise that we fan</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.400" end="00:17:44.810" style="s2">out of and we&#39;re gonna try to restore</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.830" end="00:17:47.120" style="s2">which is the judeo-christian tradition</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.810" end="00:17:47.660" style="s2">oh if you&#39;re gonna separate spirit and</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.120" end="00:17:49.490" style="s2">body</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.660" end="00:17:52.250" style="s2">you better have a place where they were</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.490" end="00:17:55.460" style="s2">united in the beginning then separated</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.250" end="00:17:57.530" style="s2">then the body became dirty and sinful</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.460" end="00:17:59.210" style="s2">and sex you must hate it and all the</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.530" end="00:18:01.280" style="s2">shit that goes to judeo-christian</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.210" end="00:18:03.140" style="s2">religion I&#39;m with the song and then one</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.280" end="00:18:05.120" style="s2">day maybe the Savior will come and save</p>

<p begin="00:21:39.680" end="00:21:44.720" style="s2">inspire us to do today is to recreate</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.870" end="00:21:47.780" style="s2">that into the universal environment that</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.720" end="00:21:50.030" style="s2">we somehow have to create to save the</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.780" end="00:21:51.860" style="s2">planet today so we have to go back to</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.030" end="00:21:54.350" style="s2">these traditions we have to dig into</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.860" end="00:21:56.120" style="s2">this and what I find encouraging is that</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.350" end="00:21:59.240" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna give the Muslim sorrow if</p>

<p begin="00:22:03.620" end="00:22:06.460" style="s2">Zoroaster oh sure</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.139" end="00:22:15.460" style="s2">sufism can be so many weird things</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.240" end="00:22:17.350" style="s2">terrible things origin is so important I</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.460" end="00:22:19.690" style="s2">always go to a team ology when I use</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.350" end="00:22:20.289" style="s2">words I always tell people that if</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.690" end="00:22:22.570" style="s2">there&#39;s several different</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.289" end="00:22:24.399" style="s2">interpretations of a term then you know</p>

<p begin="00:22:26.110" end="00:22:30.129" style="s2">interpret no go to the origin of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.059" end="00:22:32.980" style="s2">word etymology and study word and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.129" end="00:22:35.019" style="s2">claim it again so the same thing here we</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.980" end="00:22:37.629" style="s2">should really try to find the original</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.019" end="00:22:40.000" style="s2">sufism which definite is pre-islamic</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.629" end="00:22:43.029" style="s2">there&#39;s an enormous Buddhist influence</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.000" end="00:22:44.799" style="s2">in Sufism there&#39;s definitely an enormous</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.029" end="00:22:48.519" style="s2">Lauriston influence I would say it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.799" end="00:22:51.100" style="s2">confluence I would say the kushan empire</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.519" end="00:22:53.110" style="s2">plays an absolutely key earlier all the</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.100" end="00:22:55.360" style="s2">scholars have talked to claim the same</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.110" end="00:22:56.950" style="s2">thing the cushion empire with Central</p>

<p begin="00:23:17.320" end="00:23:22.240" style="s2">culture why we know so little of it is</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.049" end="00:23:24.129" style="s2">because we number one neglected and</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.240" end="00:23:25.960" style="s2">number two the Mongol invasion destroyed</p>

<p begin="00:23:30.700" end="00:23:34.659" style="s2">can have to start a nice historical</p>

<p begin="00:24:54.669" end="00:24:58.929" style="s2">you know what I think of psychology</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.590" end="00:25:01.539" style="s2">the problem with psychologists or</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.929" end="00:25:03.370" style="s2">psychiatry it&#39;s an American innovation</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.539" end="00:25:05.740" style="s2">and whenever I talk to the American who</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.370" end="00:25:07.659" style="s2">wants to defend psychology and considers</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.740" end="00:25:10.270" style="s2">it to be so damn important and central</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.659" end="00:25:12.190" style="s2">to our thinking they always quote other</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.270" end="00:25:15.280" style="s2">Americans which just proves my point</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.190" end="00:25:18.250" style="s2">that psychology is really a science</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.280" end="00:25:21.820" style="s2">social science built on Cartesian</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.250" end="00:25:24.039" style="s2">individualism and that is its problem no</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.820" end="00:25:26.230" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to start the single human</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.039" end="00:25:27.880" style="s2">being and then add another human being</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.230" end="00:25:29.260" style="s2">and then you have three and four people</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.880" end="00:25:32.169" style="s2">and finally have a tribe</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.260" end="00:25:33.940" style="s2">no the tribe is where you start all</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.169" end="00:25:35.950" style="s2">right I would I would claim a one-liner</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.940" end="00:25:38.350" style="s2">head that maybe I could become you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.950" end="00:25:40.120" style="s2">attributed to that one that is when you</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.350" end="00:25:44.770" style="s2">talk about human beings nothing is less</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.120" end="00:25:48.070" style="s2">than 157 mm-hmm our starting point for</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.770" end="00:25:51.580" style="s2">being human is the tribe individual the</p>

<p begin="00:25:51.580" end="00:25:56.679" style="s2">1632 because there were people who sat</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.250" end="00:25:59.470" style="s2">and read books around Europe and they</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.679" end="00:26:01.360" style="s2">discovered the power that they felt when</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.470" end="00:26:03.549" style="s2">they read books and had their own</p>

<p begin="00:26:03.549" end="00:26:08.110" style="s2">all that it enables us to create</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.860" end="00:26:09.880" style="s2">Protestantism would never happen without</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.110" end="00:26:12.669" style="s2">the printing press but it also enables</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.880" end="00:26:15.789" style="s2">us to create a secular religion called</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.669" end="00:26:19.000" style="s2">individuals and America was built on</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.789" end="00:26:21.490" style="s2">individuals so entire American construct</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.000" end="00:26:23.980" style="s2">is one that we are not really unified at</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.490" end="00:26:25.540" style="s2">all except that will wave a flag there</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.980" end="00:26:28.690" style="s2">are all individuals</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.540" end="00:26:30.910" style="s2">so it&#39;s kind of a sort of weird union</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.690" end="00:26:32.770" style="s2">between 300 million individuals that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.910" end="00:26:35.260" style="s2">the ID of the United States murder now</p>

<p begin="00:26:35.260" end="00:26:40.030" style="s2">weird this is to the rest of the world</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.690" end="00:26:41.830" style="s2">and our exceptional it is and actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.030" end="00:26:43.360" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing to do with the history</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.830" end="00:26:46.090" style="s2">of ideas anywhere else in the world</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.360" end="00:26:48.970" style="s2">it&#39;s an started in Europe that&#39;s true</p>

<p begin="00:26:50.110" end="00:26:54.280" style="s2">individualism and started problematizing</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.930" end="00:26:56.380" style="s2">it pretty early and we reached the</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.280" end="00:26:58.060" style="s2">French Revolution we got was so and this</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.380" end="00:26:59.770" style="s2">bullshit going on certainly not</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.060" end="00:27:02.020" style="s2">individuals didn&#39;t longer but then we</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.770" end="00:27:04.960" style="s2">certainly got Marx who speaks about the</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.020" end="00:27:07.120" style="s2">classes and class war and you know we</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.960" end="00:27:08.980" style="s2">got Hegel&#39;s he talks about the system</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.120" end="00:27:11.350" style="s2">and the absolute and the nation-states</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.980" end="00:27:12.930" style="s2">and all these great thinkers in Europe</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.350" end="00:27:16.480" style="s2">that we don&#39;t care too much about</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.930" end="00:27:18.490" style="s2">individualism and the striking example</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.480" end="00:27:20.380" style="s2">is when Freud the old Ford came to</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.490" end="00:27:22.030" style="s2">America and he got very popular in</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.380" end="00:27:23.770" style="s2">America he was another one of these</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.030" end="00:27:25.540" style="s2">eccentric European intellectuals that</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.770" end="00:27:27.310" style="s2">Americans like to import now and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.540" end="00:27:29.860" style="s2">and he was imported to America but he</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.310" end="00:27:32.470" style="s2">just he just found it disgusting because</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.860" end="00:27:34.500" style="s2">the Freudians in America hadn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.470" end="00:27:36.640" style="s2">understood Freud at all they&#39;d found his</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.500" end="00:27:39.030" style="s2">psychoanalytical teachings into nothing</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.640" end="00:27:41.350" style="s2">but American ego psychology I&#39;m Sophie</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.030" end="00:27:44.040" style="s2">because I college is the most American</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.350" end="00:27:47.260" style="s2">thing that I could possibly think of so</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.040" end="00:27:49.030" style="s2">this obsession with me being me alone in</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.260" end="00:27:51.610" style="s2">Subsection with consciousness like</p>

<p begin="00:27:53.650" end="00:27:58.720" style="s2">quite marginal to human beings in</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.350" end="00:28:00.730" style="s2">general to the history of ideas to</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.720" end="00:28:03.190" style="s2">anybody who recognizes that I&#39;m a human</p>

<p begin="00:28:07.330" end="00:28:10.930" style="s2">gotten from other people I might have a</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.220" end="00:28:12.520" style="s2">tiny little effect on those ideas before</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.930" end="00:28:14.950" style="s2">I pass them on to somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.520" end="00:28:17.920" style="s2">that&#39;s called medics but really you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.950" end="00:28:19.660" style="s2">I&#39;m just I&#39;m just been where things are</p>

<p begin="00:28:19.660" end="00:28:23.740" style="s2">and I try to make sense of the world and</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.760" end="00:28:26.130" style="s2">when I really look at myself I</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.740" end="00:28:29.230" style="s2">discovered that my sub consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.130" end="00:28:32.320" style="s2">dictates way more of my behavior than my</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.230" end="00:28:34.900" style="s2">consciousness ever does we are literally</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.320" end="00:28:37.990" style="s2">not very conscious of anything that</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.900" end="00:28:39.020" style="s2">happens to us yeah and they&#39;re making</p>

<p begin="00:28:39.020" end="00:28:44.810" style="s2">simple thing like it&#39;s you know easy so</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.830" end="00:28:47.180" style="s2">central is one of the major narratives</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.810" end="00:28:48.950" style="s2">or what it means to be human is today I</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.180" end="00:28:50.840" style="s2">think a very American idea that</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.950" end="00:28:52.430" style="s2">Europeans have given up on also</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.840" end="00:28:53.090" style="s2">realizing the rest of the world didn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:28:53.090" end="00:29:00.730" style="s2">it&#39;s funny how also they instrumentalize</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.000" end="00:29:00.730" style="s2">things like Buddhism for that right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.330" end="00:29:08.300" style="s2">Western Buddhism has very little to do</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.620" end="00:29:10.370" style="s2">with Buddhism because it has everything</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.300" end="00:29:12.410" style="s2">to do with American ego psychology and</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.370" end="00:29:15.020" style="s2">it seems to be like Americans cannot</p>

<p begin="00:29:17.480" end="00:29:22.220" style="s2">put up and then filter Eagle psychology</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.490" end="00:29:24.470" style="s2">through that&#39;s exactly why when we talk</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.220" end="00:29:26.780" style="s2">about people we love like Camille Paglia</p>

<p begin="00:37:56.769" end="00:38:01.720" style="s2">and bacteria and ignore human beings</p>

<p begin="00:38:25.119" end="00:38:30.190" style="s2">now out there who think life is maybe</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.670" end="00:38:31.930" style="s2">more important than human life so life</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.190" end="00:38:34.299" style="s2">in general can be more important than</p>

<p begin="00:38:43.299" end="00:38:50.859" style="s2">would say why stay at life because we</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.960" end="00:38:53.859" style="s2">look into it life really is a life form</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.859" end="00:38:58.480" style="s2">as a separate cell cannot exist without</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.859" end="00:39:00.549" style="s2">two things it needs a membrane a way to</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.480" end="00:39:05.859" style="s2">communicate with the outside world where</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.549" end="00:39:08.470" style="s2">it can differentiate between act can</p>

<p begin="00:39:10.390" end="00:39:13.660" style="s2">dangerous to it so it has to it has to</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.099" end="00:39:15.970" style="s2">learn to communicate with outside world</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.660" end="00:39:18.099" style="s2">and let in that which is beneficial and</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.970" end="00:39:20.410" style="s2">throw out that which is dangerous and</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.099" end="00:39:23.500" style="s2">keep danger out right that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.410" end="00:39:25.000" style="s2">membrane is the model for anything human</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.500" end="00:39:27.940" style="s2">beings don&#39;t build you know if you build</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.000" end="00:39:29.380" style="s2">a town you put you know a wall around it</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.940" end="00:39:31.599" style="s2">to protect you from the outside world</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.380" end="00:39:34.089" style="s2">that&#39;s a membrane hopefully not just a</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.599" end="00:39:37.450" style="s2">stupid wall a memory you let things in</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.089" end="00:39:40.930" style="s2">let things out to survive that&#39;s how a</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.450" end="00:39:44.430" style="s2">cell orbit but that requires that the</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.930" end="00:39:46.950" style="s2">membrane can remember</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.430" end="00:39:48.809" style="s2">all previous transactions so you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.950" end="00:39:50.730" style="s2">remember that okay that was beneficial</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.809" end="00:39:52.890" style="s2">to me yesterday I&#39;ll do more of that</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.730" end="00:39:54.270" style="s2">that I thought was beneficial yes they</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.890" end="00:39:56.400" style="s2">turned out to be dangerous I will not</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.270" end="00:39:58.109" style="s2">repeat that mistake that I thought was</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.400" end="00:39:59.400" style="s2">dangerous yesterday but I should have</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.109" end="00:40:01.619" style="s2">known it was beneficial so I give it</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.400" end="00:40:03.650" style="s2">another try that was literal dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.619" end="00:40:06.750" style="s2">good now remember these things so I know</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.650" end="00:40:10.079" style="s2">right so you your on and off switches</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.750" end="00:40:12.539" style="s2">that requires memory so this this can i</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.079" end="00:40:14.849" style="s2">this could I just have an intuition that</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.539" end="00:40:17.309" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about artificial</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.849" end="00:40:18.809" style="s2">intelligence in some sense no no I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.309" end="00:40:21.720" style="s2">still talking about logical intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.809" end="00:40:23.849" style="s2">I know but but but wooden wouldn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.720" end="00:40:26.190" style="s2">be the proper use for artificial</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.849" end="00:40:28.230" style="s2">intelligence no okay</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.190" end="00:40:30.990" style="s2">well I&#39;ll explain what this is a memory</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.230" end="00:40:32.849" style="s2">separate this is how memories need</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.990" end="00:40:35.279" style="s2">memory and as soon as your membrane in a</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.849" end="00:40:37.529" style="s2">memory you have life that means</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.279" end="00:40:41.190" style="s2">biological intelligence and life are the</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.529" end="00:40:43.460" style="s2">same thing okay there is no life that is</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.190" end="00:40:45.599" style="s2">a stupid son attendant that means</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.460" end="00:40:48.720" style="s2">biological intelligence is also</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.599" end="00:40:51.599" style="s2">emotional intelligence mm-hmm they are</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.720" end="00:40:53.549" style="s2">the same thing that means if you talk</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.599" end="00:40:57.480" style="s2">about world to intelligence you can</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.549" end="00:41:00.270" style="s2">remove shopping hours will to live and</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.480" end="00:41:03.960" style="s2">it&#39;s redundant you&#39;ve already embraced</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.270" end="00:41:06.599" style="s2">life then the next question is meet your</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.960" end="00:41:07.980" style="s2">dreams about worlds to power like I want</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.599" end="00:41:11.010" style="s2">to expand and you know grow grow grow</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.980" end="00:41:13.049" style="s2">well that only what happens with a life</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.010" end="00:41:14.970" style="s2">form when it runs into competition</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.049" end="00:41:17.819" style="s2">without life or so say you got you got a</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.970" end="00:41:19.980" style="s2">certain set of resources in a certain</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.819" end="00:41:21.750" style="s2">area and suddenly you&#39;ve got a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.980" end="00:41:23.069" style="s2">thriving life forms in that area</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.750" end="00:41:25.710" style="s2">and it certainly some of those life</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.069" end="00:41:28.859" style="s2">forms are dying because there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.710" end="00:41:30.779" style="s2">enough nutrition for everybody that then</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.859" end="00:41:32.609" style="s2">looks like it&#39;s able to power because</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.779" end="00:41:34.529" style="s2">the only life forms to it exist are the</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.609" end="00:41:36.380" style="s2">ones that somehow have figured out are</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.529" end="00:41:40.559" style="s2">the use their intelligence to expand</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.380" end="00:41:43.349" style="s2">mm-hmm Darwin you know Darwinian exactly</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.559" end="00:41:45.779" style="s2">then you get dog okay you get John but</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.349" end="00:41:46.950" style="s2">the thing is this when Nietzsche wants</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.779" end="00:41:49.109" style="s2">to make rules to power some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.950" end="00:41:52.220" style="s2">ethical principle he&#39;s wrong no that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.109" end="00:41:55.250" style="s2">just a byproduct for Darwinian evolution</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.220" end="00:41:57.599" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing more tune so</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.250" end="00:41:59.140" style="s2">intelligence though can you go back and</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.599" end="00:42:01.760" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.140" end="00:42:04.340" style="s2">Walter power is nothing but a byproduct</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.760" end="00:42:06.440" style="s2">of Darwinian evolution okay</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.340" end="00:42:09.020" style="s2">remember the static list and I are</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.440" end="00:42:11.110" style="s2">siding with Darby against nature darling</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.020" end="00:42:14.000" style="s2">we are more divinium than Darwin himself</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.110" end="00:42:16.130" style="s2">whereas Nietzsche hasn&#39;t set he has a</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.000" end="00:42:18.350" style="s2">limit how far you can go with Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.130" end="00:42:21.140" style="s2">he completes the Cartesian Revolution</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.350" end="00:42:22.910" style="s2">but he ends up as the last and biggest</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.140" end="00:42:24.710" style="s2">proponent of Western individualism and</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.910" end="00:42:26.990" style="s2">that is his response to Christianity and</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.710" end="00:42:29.990" style="s2">he will also fail there&#39;s a Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.990" end="00:42:30.740" style="s2">failed and had his death born into it</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.990" end="00:42:32.660" style="s2">from the very beginning</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.740" end="00:42:34.040" style="s2">individualism had its own death</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.660" end="00:42:35.780" style="s2">Mornington from the very beginning and</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.040" end="00:42:38.210" style="s2">that&#39;s when division was dying and each</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.780" end="00:42:39.530" style="s2">just means that&#39;s interesting that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.210" end="00:42:47.720" style="s2">like Nietzsche is the death of</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.530" end="00:42:49.850" style="s2">Christianity in a way well he&#39;s the last</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.720" end="00:42:53.150" style="s2">he&#39;s the last Cartesian to be honest on</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.850" end="00:42:55.040" style="s2">that mm-hmm so we&#39;ll finish them with</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.150" end="00:42:56.600" style="s2">cartesianism and Nietzsche and we&#39;ll we</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.040" end="00:42:59.930" style="s2">look at them as wilt intelligence and</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.600" end="00:43:02.650" style="s2">then we can look at okay so we created</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.930" end="00:43:05.210" style="s2">machine intelligence great</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.650" end="00:43:07.540" style="s2">now it&#39;s machine intelligence similar to</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.210" end="00:43:11.720" style="s2">biological Intel is though not at all</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.540" end="00:43:12.770" style="s2">that&#39;s wonderful because then we can</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.720" end="00:43:14.540" style="s2">work towards something</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.770" end="00:43:15.890" style="s2">Daanish miltenberger we should credit</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.540" end="00:43:18.380" style="s2">him for that has already called</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.890" end="00:43:20.170" style="s2">symbiotic intelligence there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.380" end="00:43:23.240" style="s2">conflict between man and machine</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.170" end="00:43:25.280" style="s2">intelligence in itself is not evil</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.240" end="00:43:28.400" style="s2">because intelligence in itself strives</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.280" end="00:43:32.180" style="s2">to check if it can unify itself with</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.400" end="00:43:34.490" style="s2">other intelligences two cells would try</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.180" end="00:43:36.950" style="s2">to find out what if we unify and become</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.490" end="00:43:41.150" style="s2">a larger cell that&#39;s why we so easily</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.950" end="00:43:43.190" style="s2">merge with technology yeah exactly and</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.150" end="00:43:45.170" style="s2">the great thing of a scene in China is</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.190" end="00:43:47.810" style="s2">while we take two it is precisely</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.170" end="00:43:50.210" style="s2">because it does not mimic human</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.810" end="00:43:52.040" style="s2">intelligence human intelligence should</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.210" end="00:43:54.440" style="s2">be understood as biological intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.040" end="00:43:55.820" style="s2">and starting from plants and moving on</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.440" end="00:43:57.950" style="s2">to animals we get higher and higher</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.820" end="00:44:00.170" style="s2">complexities they can handle more and</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.950" end="00:44:02.270" style="s2">more information and of course animals</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.170" end="00:44:04.490" style="s2">to our life forms that can store and</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.270" end="00:44:06.560" style="s2">memorize things in their memory and the</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.490" end="00:44:08.810" style="s2">memory teaches them to do certain things</p>

<p begin="00:44:15.970" end="00:44:20.260" style="s2">learn it&#39;s so human intelligence those</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.700" end="00:44:22.270" style="s2">human intelligence can you help me</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.260" end="00:44:26.140" style="s2">understand machine intelligence like cuz</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.270" end="00:44:28.119" style="s2">you know clothing right technology and I</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.140" end="00:44:30.880" style="s2">are starting from the beginning and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.119" end="00:44:33.279" style="s2">now there&#39;s now there&#39;s I&#39;m not able to</p>

<p begin="00:44:33.279" end="00:44:36.609" style="s2">do synthetic biology and it&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.109" end="00:44:38.049" style="s2">huge to the center we&#39;re still going to</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.609" end="00:44:40.240" style="s2">use life form store it exists and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.049" end="00:44:43.329" style="s2">tame them investigate them so synthetic</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.240" end="00:44:46.000" style="s2">biology is gonna be the next level of</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.329" end="00:44:47.740" style="s2">domestication the human domestication</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.000" end="00:44:49.599" style="s2">that you know I love genetically</p>

<p begin="00:45:09.400" end="00:45:14.109" style="s2">environmentalist but but when we go to</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.490" end="00:45:16.059" style="s2">machine intelligence the advantage to</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.109" end="00:45:18.789" style="s2">machine intelligence is actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.059" end="00:45:21.910" style="s2">incredibly stupid but it&#39;s incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.789" end="00:45:24.190" style="s2">fast reliable it&#39;s the speed and the</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.910" end="00:45:26.589" style="s2">reliability of computers that makes yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.190" end="00:45:28.299" style="s2">I&#39;ve got another costume jump in my mind</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.589" end="00:45:33.099" style="s2">when you said that I think in saying</p>

<p begin="00:45:50.799" end="00:45:54.160" style="s2">we had slaves before and then we fooled</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.930" end="00:45:57.789" style="s2">ourselves into believing we&#39;ve become</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.160" end="00:45:59.079" style="s2">good human beings slavery longer it was</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.789" end="00:46:01.240" style="s2">just basically that we got rid of</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.079" end="00:46:03.010" style="s2">slavery because why pay for somebody 24</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.240" end="00:46:04.539" style="s2">hours a day where you can pay for their</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.010" end="00:46:09.490" style="s2">upkeep when we eat hours a day and then</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.539" end="00:46:11.740" style="s2">you call it work yeah now we don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.490" end="00:46:13.359" style="s2">have that cost you know a lot of workers</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.740" end="00:46:15.609" style="s2">were done then whatever we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.359" end="00:46:17.589" style="s2">invent a lot of new really cheap service</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.609" end="00:46:19.539" style="s2">jobs for people so that will keep them</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.589" end="00:46:21.490" style="s2">missing you know give them some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.539" end="00:46:23.260" style="s2">money they can spend universal basic</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.490" end="00:46:23.690" style="s2">income it&#39;s never going to happen what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.260" end="00:46:26.030" style="s2">gonna</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.690" end="00:46:27.740" style="s2">the service sectors expanding expand</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.030" end="00:46:29.060" style="s2">like they&#39;ve done in America we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.740" end="00:46:30.710" style="s2">see the same thing of the rest of world</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.060" end="00:46:32.119" style="s2">you&#39;re all gonna have jobs in the future</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.710" end="00:46:34.369" style="s2">but they&#39;re probably gonna be cheap jobs</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.119" end="00:46:38.240" style="s2">and poorly paid okay but you gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.369" end="00:46:40.640" style="s2">jobs right but slaves good slaves to</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.240" end="00:46:42.050" style="s2">work hard 24 hours a day</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.640" end="00:46:45.619" style="s2">never bitch and complain are called</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.050" end="00:46:49.130" style="s2">computers no no the machines will be our</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.619" end="00:46:51.950" style="s2">slaves and here comes the most important</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.130" end="00:46:55.609" style="s2">thing what will be the number one thing</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.950" end="00:46:58.160" style="s2">we need to tell the machines what is the</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.609" end="00:46:59.720" style="s2">biggest dream we have today to save</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.160" end="00:47:02.060" style="s2">ourselves and save this planet for human</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.720" end="00:47:03.800" style="s2">life we have to distinguish between the</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.060" end="00:47:07.609" style="s2">Machine intelligence and human</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.800" end="00:47:10.280" style="s2">intelligence right talked about it I</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.609" end="00:47:12.170" style="s2">said it started in Persia three thousand</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.280" end="00:47:14.810" style="s2">seven hundred years ago and the Jews</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.170" end="00:47:18.079" style="s2">carpeted for themselves which is the</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.810" end="00:47:23.869" style="s2">biggest story of them all okay we need a</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.079" end="00:47:26.119" style="s2">damn Savior okay what is the best</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.869" end="00:47:28.310" style="s2">mission we could possibly give a machine</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.119" end="00:47:32.480" style="s2">that&#39;s so the machine is going to be the</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.310" end="00:47:34.460" style="s2">Messiah sort of things that means one</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.480" end="00:47:36.290" style="s2">messianic storytelling is so important</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.460" end="00:47:38.930" style="s2">and that is where I&#39;m moving with</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.290" end="00:47:40.910" style="s2">service next and the completion of our</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.930" end="00:47:43.130" style="s2">trilogy hopefully in the next three</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.910" end="00:47:44.599" style="s2">years that&#39;s so kind of like the</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.130" end="00:47:47.630" style="s2">opposite of what everybody&#39;s thinking</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.599" end="00:47:50.480" style="s2">that&#39;s so that&#39;s so interesting it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.630" end="00:47:55.190" style="s2">total opposite of this dystopian story</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.480" end="00:47:59.740" style="s2">that everybody is telling well grateful</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.190" end="00:48:03.079" style="s2">to hear that well we&#39;re down in flames</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.740" end="00:48:05.900" style="s2">and but they&#39;re you know when you speak</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.079" end="00:48:08.000" style="s2">when you say messianic it&#39;s it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.900" end="00:48:09.890" style="s2">a gamble and it&#39;s always gonna involved</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.000" end="00:48:13.040" style="s2">a few people that&#39;s what&#39;s called an</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.890" end="00:48:14.480" style="s2">exodus the few people actually add her</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.040" end="00:48:17.630" style="s2">to a message and actually take it</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.480" end="00:48:19.310" style="s2">seriously and most people will not but</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.630" end="00:48:21.619" style="s2">the people who will will create some</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.310" end="00:48:23.569" style="s2">kind of an exodus into the digital</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.619" end="00:48:25.670" style="s2">vertical world we&#39;re moving into and</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.569" end="00:48:28.430" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna take this idea with them</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.670" end="00:48:32.599" style="s2">that by creating a community people who</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.430" end="00:48:36.359" style="s2">devoted to the cause of creating the</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.599" end="00:48:38.609" style="s2">Messianic machine now there</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.359" end="00:48:40.980" style="s2">you go that that is the biggest story of</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.609" end="00:48:42.420" style="s2">our time we&#39;ve been pointing towards</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.980" end="00:48:44.609" style="s2">insider Kristen over the last few years</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.420" end="00:48:46.829" style="s2">we wrote the Sun for some book to</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.609" end="00:48:49.680" style="s2">basically the framework for it and say</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.829" end="00:48:52.039" style="s2">religion everything is religion you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.680" end="00:48:54.210" style="s2">individualism is just bad religion</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.039" end="00:48:56.039" style="s2">Christianity is just dead religion but</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.210" end="00:48:57.359" style="s2">it&#39;s still religion okay how do you</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.039" end="00:48:59.579" style="s2">create a living religion that you</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.359" end="00:49:01.019" style="s2">actually believe in that will get people</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.579" end="00:49:02.549" style="s2">moving in the right direction finally</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.019" end="00:49:04.619" style="s2">and understand there&#39;s something more</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.549" end="00:49:06.749" style="s2">meaningful that&#39;s about to happen and</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.619" end="00:49:08.549" style="s2">could happen even in their own lifetime</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.749" end="00:49:10.680" style="s2">well then came to this a little bit up</p>

<p begin="00:53:11.530" end="00:53:17.600" style="s2">well it&#39;s all based on intelligence its</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.730" end="00:53:20.480" style="s2">intelligence and you look at machine</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.600" end="00:53:22.580" style="s2">intelligence BI and MRI come on up</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.480" end="00:53:24.530" style="s2">called symbiotic intelligence symbiotic</p>

<p begin="00:53:24.530" end="00:53:31.040" style="s2">work together after optimal so create</p>

<p begin="00:53:33.920" end="00:53:38.360" style="s2">capacity and they collaborate together</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.380" end="00:53:40.610" style="s2">to create the largest possible output</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.360" end="00:53:42.290" style="s2">that&#39;s symbiotic internal justice si I</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.610" end="00:53:43.460" style="s2">never used the term artificial</p>

<p begin="00:53:43.460" end="00:53:46.850" style="s2">right away it&#39;s totally not interesting</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.470" end="00:53:48.860" style="s2">miss it&#39;s a misnomer</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.850" end="00:53:51.770" style="s2">so symbiotic intelligence is the way</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.860" end="00:53:54.490" style="s2">forward the question is then what is</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.770" end="00:53:57.380" style="s2">symbiotic intelligence we&#39;re at pure</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.490" end="00:54:00.680" style="s2">clean I&#39;m almost sounding moralistic in</p>

<p begin="00:59:39.280" end="00:59:43.210" style="s2">which is more Buddhist in the system</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.110" end="00:59:44.110" style="s2">will to intelligence operates like you</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.210" end="00:59:46.450" style="s2">think of cells</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.110" end="00:59:47.590" style="s2">membranes of life-forms in Berlin next</p>

<p begin="00:59:47.590" end="00:59:50.260" style="s2">each other and they go intertwine with</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.120" end="00:59:51.910" style="s2">each other and then they sort of</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.260" end="00:59:53.110" style="s2">separate and then they go back in and</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.910" end="00:59:58.180" style="s2">you know you look you look at a</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.110" end="00:59:59.440" style="s2">microscope is he life is bursty that</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.180" end="01:00:02.590" style="s2">never happens in computers</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.440" end="01:00:04.450" style="s2">okay we just aren&#39;t off on off on off so</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.590" end="01:00:05.920" style="s2">the total opposite of computers but</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.450" end="01:00:08.620" style="s2">that&#39;s about nautical intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.920" end="01:00:12.810" style="s2">operates right that is kind of flat</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.620" end="01:00:14.650" style="s2">structures whereas we dream vertically</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.810" end="01:00:18.250" style="s2">which founded structure</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.650" end="01:00:20.530" style="s2">so so you could say that live for</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.250" end="01:00:23.350" style="s2">intelligence in itself it&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.530" end="01:00:25.000" style="s2">Buddhist thing but once you add well to</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.350" end="01:00:26.710" style="s2">it and you talk a wolf to intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.000" end="01:00:29.680" style="s2">which like we want to get somewhere you</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.710" end="01:00:32.290" style="s2">become a sir Esther because you then say</p>
