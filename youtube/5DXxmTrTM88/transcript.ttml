<p begin="00:02:45.000" end="00:02:51.880" style="s2">where I think that we are in society at</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.300" end="00:02:54.820" style="s2">this point in time I&#39;m also happy to see</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.880" end="00:02:57.640" style="s2">a few familiar faces among the</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.820" end="00:02:59.830" style="s2">participants so I say hello to to all of</p>

<p begin="00:03:09.489" end="00:03:17.320" style="s2">introduction and I want to give you a</p>

<p begin="00:03:24.180" end="00:03:31.440" style="s2">meta-crisis as Peter mentioned and where</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.330" end="00:03:37.239" style="s2">I think we are in this very</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.440" end="00:03:40.600" style="s2">transformative point of human history so</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.239" end="00:03:45.010" style="s2">if I start a little bit with myself and</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.600" end="00:03:49.090" style="s2">my own background so I&#39;m Swedish I come</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.010" end="00:03:52.239" style="s2">from a very modest middle class or even</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.090" end="00:03:54.910" style="s2">even lower middle-class background from</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.239" end="00:03:57.100" style="s2">an industrial town in Sweden and I was</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.910" end="00:03:59.019" style="s2">lucky enough to be the first in my</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.100" end="00:04:02.260" style="s2">family both of my father&#39;s and my</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.019" end="00:04:04.450" style="s2">mother&#39;s side to go to university I had</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.260" end="00:04:07.360" style="s2">a talent for mathematics and physics so</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.450" end="00:04:09.880" style="s2">that&#39;s what I studied and I thought that</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.360" end="00:04:14.799" style="s2">I would become an academic within</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.880" end="00:04:18.880" style="s2">theoretical physics but for various</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.799" end="00:04:21.100" style="s2">reasons I come to realize that even</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.880" end="00:04:25.120" style="s2">though it&#39;s a very strong drive for me</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.100" end="00:04:29.040" style="s2">to try to understand the world and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.120" end="00:04:31.660" style="s2">have during the last ten years published</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.040" end="00:04:33.970" style="s2">three books that I might come back to</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.660" end="00:04:37.419" style="s2">where I&#39;m trying to analyze and trying</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.970" end="00:04:38.740" style="s2">to understand where we are in the world</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.419" end="00:04:41.650" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.740" end="00:04:46.060" style="s2">so that&#39;s a very strong drive I have but</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.650" end="00:04:49.000" style="s2">an equally strong drive I discovered was</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.060" end="00:04:53.670" style="s2">actually to change the world to do</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.000" end="00:04:57.070" style="s2">things to to create organizations and</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.670" end="00:04:59.560" style="s2">experiments so after University I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.070" end="00:05:04.900" style="s2">actually been a serial entrepreneur and</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.560" end="00:05:05.890" style="s2">started businesses in IT property and in</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.900" end="00:05:07.570" style="s2">banking</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.890" end="00:05:09.610" style="s2">I built a banking business in</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.570" end="00:05:14.980" style="s2">Scandinavia and then in Switzerland</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.610" end="00:05:17.080" style="s2">which I sold in 2001 had to commit to</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.980" end="00:05:19.240" style="s2">stay as board on the board of directors</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.080" end="00:05:21.510" style="s2">of the Swiss bank that bought my</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.240" end="00:05:25.540" style="s2">Scandinavian business for five years and</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.510" end="00:05:29.340" style="s2">be a chairman of the Banking Group in in</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.540" end="00:05:32.800" style="s2">Sweden but when that contract ended in</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.340" end="00:05:34.570" style="s2">2006 I had the opportunity to think</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.800" end="00:05:37.450" style="s2">about what to do with the second half of</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.570" end="00:05:41.950" style="s2">my life and I decided that I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.450" end="00:05:46.200" style="s2">set up a foundation in Stockholm called</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.950" end="00:05:49.480" style="s2">the Oak Island foundation accredit and</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.200" end="00:05:53.020" style="s2">we have our own island outside Stockholm</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.480" end="00:05:55.540" style="s2">the oak island where we try to both from</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.020" end="00:05:59.380" style="s2">a very practical perspective but also</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.540" end="00:06:02.550" style="s2">from a theoretical perspective look into</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.380" end="00:06:05.890" style="s2">the interrelationship between personal</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.550" end="00:06:10.480" style="s2">inner development and societal change</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.890" end="00:06:14.260" style="s2">and the reason I came up with that ten</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.480" end="00:06:19.770" style="s2">years ago was really from my experience</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.260" end="00:06:22.660" style="s2">in business starting to realize that</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.770" end="00:06:26.080" style="s2">leadership development consultants in</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.660" end="00:06:28.210" style="s2">the business world really was on to</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.080" end="00:06:32.680" style="s2">something when they pointed out that</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.210" end="00:06:38.080" style="s2">perhaps the most important trait when it</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.680" end="00:06:42.240" style="s2">comes to recruiting top managers in any</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.080" end="00:06:47.080" style="s2">organization is really a matter of inner</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.240" end="00:06:49.470" style="s2">maturation inner growth and I also had</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.080" end="00:06:52.040" style="s2">the opportunity to see firsthand how</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.470" end="00:06:55.100" style="s2">leadership development programs</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.040" end="00:06:58.310" style="s2">could facilitate this in a development</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.100" end="00:07:01.300" style="s2">in a growth what I today might call a</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.310" end="00:07:05.060" style="s2">process of consciousness development and</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.300" end="00:07:08.000" style="s2">I was very surprised by the fact that we</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.060" end="00:07:10.580" style="s2">then at least in some part of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.000" end="00:07:13.790" style="s2">business world realized the importance</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.580" end="00:07:17.480" style="s2">of interpersonal development when we are</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.790" end="00:07:22.490" style="s2">not at all in society or in education or</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.480" end="00:07:26.180" style="s2">in our political discourse at all</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.490" end="00:07:28.730" style="s2">putting any emphasis on this lifelong</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.180" end="00:07:31.700" style="s2">inner maturation process and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.730" end="00:07:36.350" style="s2">possibility of consciousness development</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.700" end="00:07:38.360" style="s2">I also learned from my years in business</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.350" end="00:07:42.110" style="s2">the importance of corporate culture and</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.360" end="00:07:44.420" style="s2">in the same way many consultants pointed</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.110" end="00:07:47.510" style="s2">out to me the importance of getting the</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.420" end="00:07:49.910" style="s2">corporate culture right if you get the</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.510" end="00:07:52.250" style="s2">corporate culture right in a in a larger</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.910" end="00:07:54.980" style="s2">organization then most things will sort</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.250" end="00:07:56.570" style="s2">themselves out whereas if you don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.980" end="00:08:00.290" style="s2">the corporate culture right it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.570" end="00:08:04.670" style="s2">matter what new reorganizations or what</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.290" end="00:08:09.310" style="s2">new manuals you you issue and then again</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.670" end="00:08:11.570" style="s2">I was surprised that in in society today</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.310" end="00:08:14.270" style="s2">outside the business world we are not at</p>

<p begin="00:11:59.480" end="00:12:05.930" style="s2">course they saw industrialization and</p>

<p begin="00:13:03.709" end="00:13:10.879" style="s2">could be described as retreat centers</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.449" end="00:13:15.139" style="s2">they created a lot of retreat centers</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.879" end="00:13:18.709" style="s2">all over Scandinavia and by the turn of</p>

<p begin="00:14:38.310" end="00:14:44.610" style="s2">course that created some sort of</p>

<p begin="00:14:54.570" end="00:15:03.089" style="s2">were actually from farming or</p>

<p begin="00:15:19.680" end="00:15:26.360" style="s2">it&#39;s not from a pre-modern society into</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.740" end="00:15:30.209" style="s2">modernity but rather from modernity</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.360" end="00:15:33.839" style="s2">via the postmodern deconstruction of</p>

<p begin="00:15:33.839" end="00:15:39.480" style="s2">know what it is it is certainly going to</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.449" end="00:15:42.540" style="s2">be emergent so we don&#39;t know what it is</p>

<p begin="00:15:42.540" end="00:15:50.940" style="s2">sometimes use the term</p>

<p begin="00:16:03.750" end="00:16:10.590" style="s2">actually involved also not and not only</p>

<p begin="00:17:43.920" end="00:17:48.740" style="s2">something that has particularly got your</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.559" end="00:17:54.600" style="s2">curiosity and your excitement right now</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.740" end="00:17:58.530" style="s2">that is either a physical place and a</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.600" end="00:18:00.540" style="s2">project or a social experiment but</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.530" end="00:18:01.860" style="s2">something that you&#39;ve you&#39;re yeah most</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.540" end="00:18:04.410" style="s2">that&#39;s most alive to you that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.860" end="00:18:06.090" style="s2">interested in for doing the inner</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.410" end="00:18:09.809" style="s2">development that right now is necessary</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.090" end="00:18:11.220" style="s2">and what you know about them what you</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.809" end="00:18:11.730" style="s2">studied and your work in the Nordics</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.220" end="00:18:15.210" style="s2">secret</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.730" end="00:18:16.860" style="s2">and these retreat centers to what extent</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.210" end="00:18:19.860" style="s2">were they priming people to like go into</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.860" end="00:18:21.559" style="s2">the world and do meaningful things or to</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.860" end="00:18:24.150" style="s2">what extent were they purely focused on</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.559" end="00:18:25.710" style="s2">this is just inner development for the</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.150" end="00:18:27.750" style="s2">sake of it sometimes that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.710" end="00:18:29.370" style="s2">wonder about is I&#39;m always doing my</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.750" end="00:18:31.860" style="s2">inner work through the lens of like how</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.370" end="00:18:35.030" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be applied and so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.860" end="00:18:40.010" style="s2">curious about how you think about that</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.030" end="00:18:40.010" style="s2">okay so so first to the question of</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.790" end="00:18:48.350" style="s2">initiatives and experiments so so I see</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.960" end="00:18:52.200" style="s2">myself more as a social entrepreneur</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.350" end="00:18:55.140" style="s2">then then a thinker or or an author</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.200" end="00:18:58.860" style="s2">certainly I have my my theory of change</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.140" end="00:19:01.740" style="s2">and I have articulated that in in my</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.860" end="00:19:04.080" style="s2">books but I think that my main strength</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.740" end="00:19:06.690" style="s2">is actually in entrepreneurship so I</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.080" end="00:19:09.600" style="s2">have started up myself a few initiatives</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.690" end="00:19:11.940" style="s2">that I could could mention so in in</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.600" end="00:19:13.620" style="s2">Stockholm we have a what could be</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.940" end="00:19:16.110" style="s2">described as a conscious co-working</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.620" end="00:19:18.809" style="s2">space where we are bringing</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.110" end="00:19:20.940" style="s2">organizations together that are working</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.809" end="00:19:24.270" style="s2">in this area and trying to cook great in</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.940" end="00:19:26.220" style="s2">this area I&#39;ve taken the initiative to a</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.270" end="00:19:29.309" style="s2">similar conscious co-working space</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.220" end="00:19:33.830" style="s2">called the co-creation loft in in Berlin</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.309" end="00:19:37.230" style="s2">and also a co living space in Stockholm</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.830" end="00:19:41.010" style="s2">where we in in the very center of</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.230" end="00:19:44.090" style="s2">Stockholm have 55 people living together</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.010" end="00:19:50.100" style="s2">in in one property</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.090" end="00:19:53.010" style="s2">20 different nations age from 23 to 55 I</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.100" end="00:19:57.120" style="s2">believe it at the moment where they are</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.010" end="00:19:59.280" style="s2">all selected because they are</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.120" end="00:20:01.140" style="s2">changemakers they could be social</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.280" end="00:20:05.400" style="s2">entrepreneurs but also just take</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.140" end="00:20:08.850" style="s2">entrepreneurs or cultural people artists</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.400" end="00:20:12.600" style="s2">wanting to sort of them influence the</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.850" end="00:20:14.700" style="s2">world but also they are committed to the</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.600" end="00:20:17.580" style="s2">inner developmental journey so all these</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.700" end="00:20:19.980" style="s2">people are also committed to working on</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.580" end="00:20:25.340" style="s2">themselves but also supporting each</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.980" end="00:20:28.470" style="s2">other in this process so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.340" end="00:20:31.920" style="s2">creating such conscious co-working</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.470" end="00:20:38.400" style="s2">spaces or cool living spaces could could</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.920" end="00:20:41.130" style="s2">be a a way to increase the consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.400" end="00:20:45.350" style="s2">and also experiment of different new</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.130" end="00:20:45.350" style="s2">ways of working and living together</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.650" end="00:20:53.940" style="s2">another initiative that are taken</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.870" end="00:20:57.240" style="s2">together with a take for good foundation</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.940" end="00:21:00.720" style="s2">in Stockholm the North Korean Foundation</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.240" end="00:21:02.760" style="s2">the Northern Lights Foundation so our</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.720" end="00:21:06.750" style="s2">two foundations are together since a</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.760" end="00:21:12.000" style="s2">couple of years working on trying to use</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.750" end="00:21:14.550" style="s2">a digital platform to support personal</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.000" end="00:21:16.530" style="s2">inner growth so we are trying to do the</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.550" end="00:21:20.309" style="s2">same thing as we are doing on on our</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.530" end="00:21:22.650" style="s2">island and you many people are doing in</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.309" end="00:21:25.590" style="s2">retreats we are trying to replicate that</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.650" end="00:21:30.870" style="s2">on a digital platform and the platform</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.590" end="00:21:33.630" style="s2">is called 29k that&#39;s 29,000 that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.870" end="00:21:37.230" style="s2">number of days you have in your life if</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.630" end="00:21:40.800" style="s2">you live a long and rich life and our</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.230" end="00:21:43.800" style="s2">tagline is make them all matter and that</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.800" end="00:21:46.470" style="s2">we are trying in this technical platform</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.800" end="00:21:50.760" style="s2">we are trying to replicate the sharing</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.470" end="00:21:53.970" style="s2">circles that are so important in its in</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.760" end="00:21:56.710" style="s2">the developmental work and we are trying</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.970" end="00:21:58.630" style="s2">to replicate that in a</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.710" end="00:22:02.860" style="s2">virtual environment just like we are in</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.630" end="00:22:07.809" style="s2">in right now and to our surprise it has</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.860" end="00:22:15.000" style="s2">it has turned out to actually be working</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.809" end="00:22:19.029" style="s2">at least as well digitally as in</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.000" end="00:22:23.380" style="s2">physical space in some of our users</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.029" end="00:22:26.470" style="s2">actually think it is more comfortable to</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.380" end="00:22:30.820" style="s2">do these type of deep sharing when you</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.470" end="00:22:34.029" style="s2">are at home in your room known and</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.820" end="00:22:39.520" style="s2">comfortable surroundings rather than</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.029" end="00:22:42.580" style="s2">being in a new unfamiliar place so we</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.520" end="00:22:44.799" style="s2">are very lucky there so I think as as I</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.580" end="00:22:46.710" style="s2">said we are in an emergent process I</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.799" end="00:22:49.360" style="s2">certainly believe that consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.710" end="00:22:52.570" style="s2">development supporting large scale of</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.360" end="00:22:56.529" style="s2">consciousness development is nice needed</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.570" end="00:22:58.480" style="s2">exactly how we do this exactly what the</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.529" end="00:23:02.470" style="s2">odds are when we are at this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.480" end="00:23:05.470" style="s2">phase shift or bifurcation point I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.470" end="00:23:08.799" style="s2">know we I can see a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.470" end="00:23:12.100" style="s2">pointing to there to the dark side so I</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.799" end="00:23:15.100" style="s2">certainly believe that we have a huge</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.100" end="00:23:17.919" style="s2">risk of this phase transition actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.100" end="00:23:19.899" style="s2">being a breakdown in the international</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.919" end="00:23:22.630" style="s2">system being a breakdown of our</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.899" end="00:23:26.140" style="s2">societies but I also see the possibility</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.630" end="00:23:30.610" style="s2">of the emergence of a new civilization</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.140" end="00:23:32.350" style="s2">and I think that what we can do part</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.610" end="00:23:35.440" style="s2">from working with consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.350" end="00:23:38.200" style="s2">development it&#39;s just experimenting with</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.440" end="00:23:42.010" style="s2">new ways of being together and working</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.200" end="00:23:44.890" style="s2">together and then see what is what is</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.010" end="00:23:49.840" style="s2">actually working so in that respect I</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.890" end="00:23:55.570" style="s2">see the Nordic secret more as a case</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.840" end="00:23:57.490" style="s2">study than a blueprint I don&#39;t think we</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.570" end="00:24:00.690" style="s2">should try to replicate and do the same</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.490" end="00:24:03.669" style="s2">today on a global basis but certainly</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.690" end="00:24:08.580" style="s2">the Nordic secret tells us that a</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.669" end="00:24:09.950" style="s2">large-scale focus on inner development</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.580" end="00:24:12.860" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.950" end="00:24:15.649" style="s2">shift coal countries and has shifted</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.860" end="00:24:17.830" style="s2">called whole countries for for the</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.649" end="00:24:17.830" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.460" end="00:24:24.159" style="s2">thank you Peter will you ask you a</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.159" end="00:24:26.389" style="s2">question about the meta-crisis and</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.159" end="00:24:30.010" style="s2">everywhere else continue to share your</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.389" end="00:24:33.500" style="s2">questions in the chat thanks Jason</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.010" end="00:24:37.399" style="s2">yeah so I&#39;m I appreciate good coinage</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.500" end="00:24:39.950" style="s2">and I love the term medic crisis which I</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.399" end="00:24:43.730" style="s2">believe you coined so I&#39;m curious like</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.950" end="00:24:46.460" style="s2">the when and the why of of when you you</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.730" end="00:24:48.139" style="s2">coined it and if you can maybe like I</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.460" end="00:24:51.710" style="s2">does an elevator pitch like just unpack</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.139" end="00:24:55.700" style="s2">what that term means for you so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.710" end="00:24:59.179" style="s2">know if I can claim that I coined it I</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.700" end="00:25:03.340" style="s2">think this term has been around in our</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.179" end="00:25:07.610" style="s2">in our circles for for quite a few years</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.340" end="00:25:09.200" style="s2">and certainly in in one of our my image</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.610" end="00:25:10.820" style="s2">and other initiative that I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.200" end="00:25:13.730" style="s2">mention and that is the prospective I</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.820" end="00:25:15.679" style="s2">Institute in in London we have been</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.730" end="00:25:18.049" style="s2">talking about the meta crisis for for</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.679" end="00:25:21.590" style="s2">quite some years so it it might actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.049" end="00:25:23.779" style="s2">be here Jonathan Rosen at the</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.590" end="00:25:25.929" style="s2">perspectiva Institute whom mentioned it</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.779" end="00:25:28.370" style="s2">the first time I don&#39;t remember exactly</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.929" end="00:25:31.159" style="s2">but I think I was the first one writing</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.370" end="00:25:34.220" style="s2">about it and writing about it in in my</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.159" end="00:25:39.440" style="s2">book the the world we create and</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.220" end="00:25:41.690" style="s2">unpacking it a little bit and I just</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.440" end="00:25:46.070" style="s2">think it&#39;s important that that that we</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.690" end="00:25:48.529" style="s2">recognize that these different crises</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.070" end="00:25:50.269" style="s2">that we see in the world and that we</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.529" end="00:25:53.929" style="s2">have seen for many years like the</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.269" end="00:25:56.120" style="s2">environmental crisis the inequality</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.929" end="00:26:00.529" style="s2">crisis of psychological ill health</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.120" end="00:26:04.220" style="s2">crisis the obesity crisis all of these</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.529" end="00:26:08.059" style="s2">different crises that they are not</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.220" end="00:26:10.070" style="s2">separated from each other and that it</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.059" end="00:26:15.529" style="s2">might actually be that all these</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.070" end="00:26:19.340" style="s2">different crises are just symptoms of an</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.529" end="00:26:21.970" style="s2">underlying meta-crisis and for me then</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.340" end="00:26:24.970" style="s2">that meta crisis is really about our</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.970" end="00:26:24.970" style="s2">press</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.089" end="00:26:33.289" style="s2">worldview and way of organizing our</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.239" end="00:26:35.119" style="s2">society going back all the way to the</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.289" end="00:26:38.869" style="s2">Enlightenment that was the last time</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.119" end="00:26:41.989" style="s2">when we really shifted our our way of</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.869" end="00:26:44.539" style="s2">looking at ourselves and on society and</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.989" end="00:26:47.209" style="s2">on the world that new world that</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.539" end="00:26:49.179" style="s2">worldview that we got through the</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.209" end="00:26:52.820" style="s2">Enlightenment has of course served</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.179" end="00:26:54.739" style="s2">humanity very well in many respects we</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.820" end="00:26:58.190" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t want to be without modern</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.739" end="00:27:02.869" style="s2">medicine and democracy and human rights</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.190" end="00:27:05.239" style="s2">and all of this but at the same time I</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.869" end="00:27:09.979" style="s2">think that that worldview is now</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.239" end="00:27:14.959" style="s2">reaching the the limits of its capacity</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.979" end="00:27:17.989" style="s2">and that we need to not leave that way</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.959" end="00:27:22.339" style="s2">of looking behind totally but certainly</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.989" end="00:27:26.359" style="s2">expand on our worldview in in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.339" end="00:27:29.629" style="s2">and in my book the world we create I</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.359" end="00:27:31.700" style="s2">point at at least five ways I need no</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.629" end="00:27:35.209" style="s2">five directions I think we need to</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.700" end="00:27:38.599" style="s2">expand our worldview and just very</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.209" end="00:27:43.209" style="s2">briefly it&#39;s about realizing that we are</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.599" end="00:27:45.739" style="s2">not just these isolated individuals</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.209" end="00:27:48.440" style="s2">maximizing our own utility that the</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.739" end="00:27:50.629" style="s2">enlightenment philosophers wanted us to</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.440" end="00:27:52.729" style="s2">believe that we were of course we are in</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.629" end="00:27:54.979" style="s2">some respects individuals and we should</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.729" end="00:27:58.450" style="s2">keep our individuality but we should</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.979" end="00:28:01.759" style="s2">also realize that we are so totally</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.450" end="00:28:03.709" style="s2">interconnected and and interdependent</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.759" end="00:28:08.779" style="s2">and that we need to keep these both</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.709" end="00:28:11.769" style="s2">aspects live at the same time we also</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.779" end="00:28:14.599" style="s2">need to go into a much much more</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.769" end="00:28:17.029" style="s2">systemic and holistic way of looking at</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.599" end="00:28:19.179" style="s2">the world rather than this linear and</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.029" end="00:28:24.379" style="s2">analytical way that again through</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.179" end="00:28:28.039" style="s2">Newtonian physics has inspired so much</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.379" end="00:28:30.320" style="s2">of science during the last 200 years and</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.039" end="00:28:32.329" style="s2">been very very useful but it has to</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.320" end="00:28:35.179" style="s2">become complemented with a systemic</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.329" end="00:28:36.730" style="s2">holistic way of looking at the world</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.179" end="00:28:40.299" style="s2">the next shift</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.730" end="00:28:42.640" style="s2">is the view of our mind going again from</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.299" end="00:28:45.549" style="s2">the enlightenment philosophers view of</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.640" end="00:28:48.520" style="s2">our mind as a rational machine to</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.549" end="00:28:52.929" style="s2">realizing that our mind is a an evolving</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.520" end="00:28:57.640" style="s2">organic system under constant evolution</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.929" end="00:29:00.299" style="s2">throughout our lives and then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.640" end="00:29:06.040" style="s2">waking up to our socially constructed</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.299" end="00:29:09.040" style="s2">reality so I think that meta crisis is a</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.040" end="00:29:12.179" style="s2">key term consciousness development is a</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.040" end="00:29:15.850" style="s2">key term but also our collective</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.179" end="00:29:18.929" style="s2">imaginary is a key term our collective</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.850" end="00:29:24.360" style="s2">imaginary that is sort of like the water</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.929" end="00:29:28.240" style="s2">that we see that as fishes we we swim in</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.360" end="00:29:30.340" style="s2">we have this societal culture that we</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.240" end="00:29:32.440" style="s2">are in the and our worldview and all</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.340" end="00:29:34.929" style="s2">these hidden assumptions that we just</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.440" end="00:29:37.179" style="s2">take for granted and of course my</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.929" end="00:29:39.490" style="s2">favourite example there is the market</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.179" end="00:29:40.840" style="s2">that we believe is such a sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.490" end="00:29:45.220" style="s2">natural phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.840" end="00:29:47.500" style="s2">when in fact even even the free market</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.220" end="00:29:50.140" style="s2">if there should be such a thing is a</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.500" end="00:29:52.470" style="s2">social construct is something that we as</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.140" end="00:29:54.780" style="s2">humans had consciously and unconsciously</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.470" end="00:29:58.120" style="s2">created during the last couple of</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.780" end="00:30:01.150" style="s2">hundred years and we need to start to</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.120" end="00:30:04.600" style="s2">see these things as human constructs</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.150" end="00:30:07.090" style="s2">because the moment we start to see the</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.600" end="00:30:09.760" style="s2">water we swim in we can start to take a</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.090" end="00:30:13.390" style="s2">responsibility for that water and we can</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.760" end="00:30:15.429" style="s2">try to to change it but of course the</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.390" end="00:30:17.290" style="s2">problem there is that to change our</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.429" end="00:30:19.890" style="s2">collective imaginary we need to do that</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.290" end="00:30:23.770" style="s2">collectively we can only do so much</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.890" end="00:30:25.179" style="s2">individually because we need to be we</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.770" end="00:30:29.470" style="s2">need we are all swimming in the same</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.179" end="00:30:32.350" style="s2">water and then finally in the last shift</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.470" end="00:30:37.470" style="s2">in our worldview is really going away</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.350" end="00:30:40.809" style="s2">from this focus on material growth and</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.470" end="00:30:45.309" style="s2">utility to really to start to see that</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.809" end="00:30:47.890" style="s2">we need to focus on meaning and and</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.309" end="00:30:50.640" style="s2">purpose and that is again a shift from</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.890" end="00:30:56.850" style="s2">the outside world to to our to our</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.640" end="00:30:58.890" style="s2">the world so yeah really good okay we</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.850" end="00:31:00.750" style="s2">have a lot of juicy questions so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.890" end="00:31:02.490" style="s2">gonna focus on calling on the people</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.750" end="00:31:04.650" style="s2">that received like plus ones or up votes</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.490" end="00:31:06.240" style="s2">on their questions to continue sourcing</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.650" end="00:31:06.690" style="s2">the collective here and the best way we</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.240" end="00:31:09.080" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.690" end="00:31:11.910" style="s2">so up though questions as well that you</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.080" end="00:31:14.820" style="s2">want to and then also questions that</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.910" end="00:31:25.500" style="s2">build on what&#39;s being said so rainy will</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.820" end="00:31:27.710" style="s2">you ask your question sure let me find</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.500" end="00:31:27.710" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.950" end="00:31:36.960" style="s2">so many good questions on capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.540" end="00:31:41.700" style="s2">Thanks yeah I was um brought up the</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.960" end="00:31:46.560" style="s2">market and this move from modernism in</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.700" end="00:31:48.030" style="s2">which capitalism is so important what</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.560" end="00:31:51.860" style="s2">are your what are your thoughts about</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.030" end="00:31:56.040" style="s2">conscious capitalism as a viable</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.860" end="00:31:59.430" style="s2">platform I know within that community</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.040" end="00:32:01.560" style="s2">there&#39;s this sense that if we can be</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.430" end="00:32:04.350" style="s2">more conscious more sustainable good</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.560" end="00:32:08.310" style="s2">business practices than that then that</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.350" end="00:32:09.810" style="s2">will sort of save our society from the</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.310" end="00:32:12.570" style="s2">climate crisis and then there&#39;s other</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.810" end="00:32:17.820" style="s2">viewpoints that the whole structure is</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.570" end="00:32:21.030" style="s2">is unsustainable and there&#39;s so many</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.820" end="00:32:22.650" style="s2">externalities not to mention a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.030" end="00:32:25.290" style="s2">exploitative relationship with things</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.650" end="00:32:27.180" style="s2">that it&#39;s the sort of spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.290" end="00:32:29.850" style="s2">materialism to think that just by being</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.180" end="00:32:32.960" style="s2">good or conscious we can continue living</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.850" end="00:32:35.580" style="s2">the way we do what do you think about</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.960" end="00:32:40.280" style="s2">conscious capitalism and in those two</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.580" end="00:32:45.660" style="s2">perspectives that is a very good</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.280" end="00:32:51.060" style="s2">question and one way of addressing it</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.660" end="00:32:55.920" style="s2">would be to introduce bill sharps model</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.060" end="00:32:57.960" style="s2">of the three horizons that we have the</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.920" end="00:33:00.570" style="s2">first horizon that&#39;s the system where we</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.960" end="00:33:03.270" style="s2">are today we have the third horizon</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.570" end="00:33:04.140" style="s2">that&#39;s the system where we want to be in</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.270" end="00:33:06.840" style="s2">perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.140" end="00:33:10.140" style="s2">10 20 100 years and then we have the</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.840" end="00:33:12.420" style="s2">second horizon in between which might be</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.140" end="00:33:14.910" style="s2">things that we need to put in place in</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.420" end="00:33:19.260" style="s2">order to be able to go from the first</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.910" end="00:33:21.120" style="s2">risin to to the third horizon and I</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.260" end="00:33:23.910" style="s2">would say that certainly conscious</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.120" end="00:33:27.090" style="s2">capitalism and and and other initiatives</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.910" end="00:33:30.120" style="s2">like that are very good initiatives in</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.090" end="00:33:33.450" style="s2">in the first rise that&#39;s of course what</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.120" end="00:33:35.730" style="s2">we could do already today in order to</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.450" end="00:33:38.490" style="s2">try to make the market and business</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.730" end="00:33:41.090" style="s2">function a little bit better a little</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.490" end="00:33:44.480" style="s2">bit more just a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.090" end="00:33:49.470" style="s2">regenerative and a little bit more more</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.480" end="00:33:52.410" style="s2">sustainable but and this is my personal</p>

<p begin="00:35:28.390" end="00:35:35.050" style="s2">main point is that that can be done even</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.619" end="00:35:39.190" style="s2">more so I noticed through my years in</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.050" end="00:35:42.010" style="s2">banking that it is constantly done so</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.190" end="00:35:44.200" style="s2">within the banking industry we were and</p>

<p begin="00:35:47.580" end="00:35:56.740" style="s2">lobbying on the American legislators and</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.840" end="00:36:01.450" style="s2">on the EU legislators to tweak these</p>

<p begin="00:36:10.630" end="00:36:16.330" style="s2">my point here was that I was very</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.720" end="00:36:19.300" style="s2">surprised but when I saw this in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.330" end="00:36:23.800" style="s2">banking industry how how many times</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.300" end="00:36:27.730" style="s2">naive the legislators were when the</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.800" end="00:36:32.770" style="s2">industry was coming with their very</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.730" end="00:36:35.109" style="s2">expensive consultancy reports explaining</p>

<p begin="00:36:40.450" end="00:36:46.900" style="s2">and there were none such job done for</p>

<p begin="00:36:46.900" end="00:36:52.089" style="s2">there was nobody arguing well these</p>

<p begin="00:36:54.670" end="00:37:01.270" style="s2">least we need to have some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.530" end="00:37:04.420" style="s2">balance here and we need to sort of help</p>

<p begin="00:37:44.830" end="00:37:50.040" style="s2">think is evident that that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.110" end="00:37:54.430" style="s2">have then we need to rethink the market</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.040" end="00:37:56.950" style="s2">front from from bottom the good news is</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.430" end="00:37:59.590" style="s2">that i think that we have help here in</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.950" end="00:38:01.810" style="s2">the technological development and</p>

<p begin="00:38:32.770" end="00:38:37.510" style="s2">efficiency and that is probably the only</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.990" end="00:38:39.490" style="s2">way we could have done it 200 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.510" end="00:38:42.280" style="s2">and a 100 years ago perhaps even 20</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.490" end="00:38:44.860" style="s2">years ago but going forward we can have</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.280" end="00:38:47.080" style="s2">more efficient markets more deeper</p>

<p begin="00:39:01.620" end="00:39:06.310" style="s2">this is inspired by John for Vicki and</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.480" end="00:39:08.560" style="s2">his idea of wisdom cultivation so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.310" end="00:39:10.630" style="s2">the context but the question is it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.560" end="00:39:12.640" style="s2">statement first the move from external</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.630" end="00:39:16.120" style="s2">authority to internal authorship is</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.640" end="00:39:18.580" style="s2">complex and intuition in part seems to</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.120" end="00:39:20.740" style="s2">be seems to be a kind of thinking from</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.580" end="00:39:23.770" style="s2">spiritual mind rather than from the</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.740" end="00:39:25.960" style="s2">rational brain mind organizational</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.770" end="00:39:28.990" style="s2">leadership and democracy seems extended</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.960" end="00:39:30.460" style="s2">rational thought my intuition is that</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.990" end="00:39:32.140" style="s2">the next development stage is a</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.460" end="00:39:34.630" style="s2">different kind of organization and</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.140" end="00:39:36.970" style="s2">governance more like an organism than a</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.630" end="00:39:39.250" style="s2">machine and operating from a spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.970" end="00:39:41.830" style="s2">mind transcending and including the gut</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.250" end="00:39:43.660" style="s2">heart mind and brain mind does this</p>

<p begin="00:39:45.550" end="00:39:52.380" style="s2">wisdom cultivation looks like absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.250" end="00:39:55.930" style="s2">what was that a quote from John Bevere</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.380" end="00:39:58.930" style="s2">that&#39;s my own that&#39;s my own inspiration</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.930" end="00:40:02.230" style="s2">hit listening to John okay yeah okay now</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.930" end="00:40:08.550" style="s2">I I agree hundred percent with with with</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.230" end="00:40:08.550" style="s2">what you what you said so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.120" end="00:40:15.460" style="s2">just just like going from the pre-modern</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.130" end="00:40:19.900" style="s2">world to the modern world was enabled by</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.460" end="00:40:25.120" style="s2">us really developing a rationalistic way</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.900" end="00:40:27.760" style="s2">of thinking and knowing and again that</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.120" end="00:40:30.900" style="s2">way of thinking and knowing has got</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.760" end="00:40:32.530" style="s2">tremendous strengths and potential</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.900" end="00:40:36.100" style="s2">particularly when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.530" end="00:40:38.230" style="s2">understanding the natural world so I</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.100" end="00:40:41.040" style="s2">think again what we need to do now is</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.230" end="00:40:48.010" style="s2">that we need to to develop new ways of</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.040" end="00:40:50.950" style="s2">understanding and knowing not of course</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.010" end="00:40:55.240" style="s2">leaving the rational way of of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.950" end="00:40:58.780" style="s2">and the science science behind but</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.240" end="00:41:03.070" style="s2">understand that they are very very</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.780" end="00:41:05.950" style="s2">strong when it comes to to natural</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.070" end="00:41:08.130" style="s2">phenomena when it comes to social</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.950" end="00:41:10.900" style="s2">phenomenon or even inner world</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.130" end="00:41:15.100" style="s2">phenomenon then we need to complement</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.900" end="00:41:23.140" style="s2">that way of of of knowing certainly with</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.100" end="00:41:27.730" style="s2">with intuition in inspiration I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.140" end="00:41:32.050" style="s2">myself a religious person I I could even</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.730" end="00:41:35.250" style="s2">sometimes label myself as an artist but</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.050" end="00:41:41.099" style="s2">I certainly think that</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.250" end="00:41:44.849" style="s2">this direction of inner development is</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.099" end="00:41:46.980" style="s2">moving us in the same direction as many</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.849" end="00:41:51.540" style="s2">religions have been trying to move us</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.980" end="00:41:56.910" style="s2">and is fundamental in in many spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.540" end="00:42:02.849" style="s2">traditions so in some way you could say</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.910" end="00:42:07.130" style="s2">that this crisis is meta-crisis which is</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.849" end="00:42:10.109" style="s2">an existential crisis for Humanity the</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.130" end="00:42:13.339" style="s2">outcome of that will be dependent on if</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.109" end="00:42:18.390" style="s2">we can again access some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.339" end="00:42:22.369" style="s2">spiritual development and I would even</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.390" end="00:42:25.170" style="s2">say and I would even say that this</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.369" end="00:42:26.910" style="s2">concept of consciousness development</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.170" end="00:42:28.890" style="s2">that we were practicing and in the</p>

<p begin="00:45:20.699" end="00:45:26.849" style="s2">language was completely new to Lenin I</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.400" end="00:45:29.429" style="s2">myself because in in the books of</p>

<p begin="00:45:39.839" end="00:45:46.890" style="s2">society was all about material progress</p>

<p begin="00:46:07.770" end="00:46:13.020" style="s2">of course Lenin IV became very very</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.080" end="00:46:15.840" style="s2">curious to see where where this thinking</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.020" end="00:46:17.310" style="s2">was coming from and it comes from the</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.840" end="00:46:20.820" style="s2">German philosophers and they actually</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.310" end="00:46:23.810" style="s2">had a specific name a German name that</p>

<p begin="00:46:23.810" end="00:46:31.410" style="s2">for this type of development and they</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.150" end="00:46:35.730" style="s2">call it building which is somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.410" end="00:46:38.820" style="s2">between formation and realization it is</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.730" end="00:46:42.000" style="s2">the natural formation and realization of</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.820" end="00:46:45.260" style="s2">your consciousness throughout life and</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.000" end="00:46:48.900" style="s2">the way that that can be facilitated</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.260" end="00:46:51.119" style="s2">that is called building and to come back</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.900" end="00:46:53.430" style="s2">to the previous question that I now</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.119" end="00:46:58.230" style="s2">realized that I didn&#39;t answer this</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.430" end="00:47:01.980" style="s2">building is done for the individual the</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.230" end="00:47:05.180" style="s2">benefit of the individual certainly but</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.980" end="00:47:07.680" style="s2">mostly for the benefit of society</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.180" end="00:47:10.099" style="s2">because with many people in society</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.680" end="00:47:13.560" style="s2">having gone through this building</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.099" end="00:47:16.560" style="s2">journey you can actually have a societal</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.560" end="00:47:18.630" style="s2">culture that is more conscious and once</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.560" end="00:47:22.290" style="s2">you are able to realize a more conscious</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.630" end="00:47:27.089" style="s2">culture that culture can then in turn</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.290" end="00:47:29.849" style="s2">help people and support people in their</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.089" end="00:47:31.880" style="s2">consciousness development so realizing</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.849" end="00:47:35.070" style="s2">the interdependence between the inner</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.880" end="00:47:37.710" style="s2">building and the formation of society</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.070" end="00:47:40.530" style="s2">and how these can form a positive spiral</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.710" end="00:47:43.290" style="s2">that is really the idea behind building</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.530" end="00:47:46.560" style="s2">and and that is the concept that was</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.290" end="00:47:49.290" style="s2">picked up in Scandinavia and even if I</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.560" end="00:47:52.589" style="s2">just quoted now the the leading social</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.290" end="00:47:56.010" style="s2">democrat in in sweden interestingly</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.589" end="00:47:59.670" style="s2">enough this concept this worldview was</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.010" end="00:48:02.430" style="s2">embraced both by the socialist but also</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.670" end="00:48:07.230" style="s2">more towards the right the Liberals and</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.430" end="00:48:10.210" style="s2">the Conservatives everyone saw value in</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.230" end="00:48:11.770" style="s2">this for different values</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.210" end="00:48:15.030" style="s2">on the conservative side you saw that</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.770" end="00:48:19.390" style="s2">you saw the value of having a rich</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.030" end="00:48:22.770" style="s2">culture richer culture on the liberal</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.390" end="00:48:26.740" style="s2">side you saw the value of a bet</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.770" end="00:48:28.900" style="s2">well-educated population and on the more</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.740" end="00:48:31.660" style="s2">socialist side you saw this as a very</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.900" end="00:48:34.869" style="s2">important tool for the emancipation of</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.660" end="00:48:39.490" style="s2">the working class and for the building</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.869" end="00:48:41.410" style="s2">up of a new modern democratic society so</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.490" end="00:48:47.140" style="s2">this was really a worldview that that</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.410" end="00:48:49.599" style="s2">permeated the Nordic countries a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.140" end="00:48:51.670" style="s2">years ago then you can ask question</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.599" end="00:48:54.099" style="s2">where did all this go and why have we</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.670" end="00:48:56.560" style="s2">forgotten it today and the reason is</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.099" end="00:48:57.970" style="s2">that we change worldview and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.560" end="00:49:01.060" style="s2">I think it&#39;s very important that we</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.970" end="00:49:04.089" style="s2">change worldview again because sometime</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.060" end="00:49:06.250" style="s2">around the Second World War and they</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.089" end="00:49:09.810" style="s2">certainly having being an effect of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.250" end="00:49:13.810" style="s2">fact that Germany lost two world wars we</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.810" end="00:49:17.980" style="s2">all in Scandinavia turned our focus away</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.810" end="00:49:20.560" style="s2">from Germany from the the Germanic</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.980" end="00:49:22.810" style="s2">philosophers German stopped being the</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.560" end="00:49:24.609" style="s2">academic language in Sweden it was the</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.810" end="00:49:27.099" style="s2">academic language in Sweden up until the</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.609" end="00:49:30.880" style="s2">Second World War and we went to to</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.099" end="00:49:33.369" style="s2">English and we turned our focus towards</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.880" end="00:49:35.440" style="s2">the anglo-saxon world towards Oxford and</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.369" end="00:49:37.000" style="s2">Cambridge and what did we find there</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.440" end="00:49:39.760" style="s2">well we find the Enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.000" end="00:49:43.990" style="s2">philosopher we find luck in and the scar</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.760" end="00:49:48.400" style="s2">and analytical philosophy all being this</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.990" end="00:49:50.680" style="s2">rationalistic mind and we switched to a</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.400" end="00:49:53.619" style="s2">positivistic view of the world where</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.680" end="00:49:56.500" style="s2">only what is measurable counts and</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.619" end="00:49:59.410" style="s2">anything a of the inner world is</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.500" end="00:50:04.510" style="s2">subjective and therefore not really</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.410" end="00:50:06.730" style="s2">worth our attention so yes we completely</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.510" end="00:50:09.910" style="s2">lost this focus and we now I can</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.730" end="00:50:12.609" style="s2">understand why our history books do not</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.910" end="00:50:15.160" style="s2">even mention this because from from our</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.609" end="00:50:18.250" style="s2">worldview today consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.160" end="00:50:20.109" style="s2">development doesn&#39;t make sense we again</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.250" end="00:50:23.680" style="s2">believe that our mind is a rational</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.109" end="00:50:25.329" style="s2">machine that should just be functioning</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.680" end="00:50:28.510" style="s2">is not functioning we should take some</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.329" end="00:50:31.420" style="s2">pills oh go to therapy go in therapy to</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.510" end="00:50:35.200" style="s2">make it work again and they sort of huge</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.420" end="00:50:37.930" style="s2">developmental potential that we used to</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.200" end="00:50:40.230" style="s2">see in Scandinavia that that is often</p>

<p begin="00:50:40.839" end="00:50:46.119" style="s2">and again now yeah and and again just to</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.960" end="00:50:49.380" style="s2">tie it all up to what we are doing what</p>

<p begin="00:52:53.680" end="00:53:01.930" style="s2">familiar with that and I think he is</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.650" end="00:53:07.600" style="s2">he&#39;s absolutely absolutely right in in</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.930" end="00:53:13.110" style="s2">many ways the postmodern philosophy and</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.600" end="00:53:17.350" style="s2">thinking is in my opinion a dead end but</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.110" end="00:53:22.090" style="s2">it has certainly helped us to to see the</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.350" end="00:53:25.980" style="s2">limitations of our modernistic way of</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.090" end="00:53:29.430" style="s2">thinking and it has pointed out many</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.980" end="00:53:33.490" style="s2">important realizations for for example</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.430" end="00:53:37.390" style="s2">the fact that our world is socially</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.490" end="00:53:39.490" style="s2">constructed before of the postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.390" end="00:53:42.310" style="s2">philosophers we we took the water</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.490" end="00:53:44.260" style="s2">forgiven and the postmodern philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.310" end="00:53:46.660" style="s2">are really pointing the finger too</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.260" end="00:53:49.510" style="s2">water so the post-modern loss of her</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.660" end="00:53:54.790" style="s2">helps us see the water the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.510" end="00:53:57.160" style="s2">exactly as you pointed out the</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.790" end="00:54:00.250" style="s2">postmodern thinking very very easily</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.160" end="00:54:05.040" style="s2">ends up in a relativistic thinking we</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.250" end="00:54:08.580" style="s2">realize that all meta-narratives are</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.040" end="00:54:11.860" style="s2">human-made and therefore they conclude</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.580" end="00:54:17.170" style="s2">wrongly that they are all arbitrary and</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.860" end="00:54:19.690" style="s2">worthless no we as humans we need our</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.170" end="00:54:23.770" style="s2">symbolic universe we need our</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.690" end="00:54:25.480" style="s2">meta-narratives yes we will never or no</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.770" end="00:54:28.270" style="s2">we will never find in that</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.480" end="00:54:31.180" style="s2">meta-narrative out there we will not</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.270" end="00:54:34.060" style="s2">find it in God or in a religion we will</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.180" end="00:54:36.970" style="s2">not find it in science and we will not</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.060" end="00:54:40.180" style="s2">find it in the market so I argue in my</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.970" end="00:54:43.500" style="s2">book the world we create that all these</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.180" end="00:54:45.640" style="s2">lot of meta-narratives and these</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.500" end="00:54:47.890" style="s2">ultimate authorities in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.640" end="00:54:49.720" style="s2">meta-narratives like god science and the</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.890" end="00:54:52.930" style="s2">market when we realize that they are</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.720" end="00:54:56.350" style="s2">human constructs we can either be</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.930" end="00:55:00.100" style="s2">completely relativistic and just give up</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.350" end="00:55:03.340" style="s2">hope or we can make the metamodel move</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.100" end="00:55:06.130" style="s2">and say well then we need as humans to</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.340" end="00:55:08.350" style="s2">take responsibility for our socially</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.130" end="00:55:10.540" style="s2">constructed world we need to take</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.350" end="00:55:12.940" style="s2">responsibility for our meta-narratives</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.540" end="00:55:16.420" style="s2">and we need to take responsibility for</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.940" end="00:55:19.270" style="s2">our ultimate authorities we need all of</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.420" end="00:55:21.190" style="s2">these but we see now that they are human</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.270" end="00:55:26.320" style="s2">constructs and we need to take</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.190" end="00:55:30.310" style="s2">responsibility for them so and here I I</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.320" end="00:55:32.200" style="s2">agree totally with with an integral way</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.310" end="00:55:35.170" style="s2">of thinking with cam Wilbur&#39;s way of</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.200" end="00:55:38.250" style="s2">thinking when it comes to that the next</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.170" end="00:55:42.010" style="s2">way of seeing the world has to integrate</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.250" end="00:55:44.110" style="s2">the best components of the pre-modern</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.010" end="00:55:46.450" style="s2">way of thinking we were even we were</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.110" end="00:55:49.540" style="s2">just talking about the spiritual way of</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.450" end="00:55:53.250" style="s2">thinking perhaps even the prehistorical</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.540" end="00:55:55.980" style="s2">way of seeing the world indigenous or</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.250" end="00:55:58.030" style="s2">archaic way of looking at the world</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.980" end="00:56:00.400" style="s2">certainly the pre-modern</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.030" end="00:56:03.070" style="s2">ways of looking at the world the best of</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.400" end="00:56:06.040" style="s2">modernity the best of reason the best of</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.070" end="00:56:09.190" style="s2">science and then the best insights of</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.040" end="00:56:11.290" style="s2">the postmodern philosophy and then</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.190" end="00:56:16.000" style="s2">integrate that into some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.290" end="00:56:17.580" style="s2">integral or holistic way of honest of</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.000" end="00:56:20.770" style="s2">seeing the world</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.580" end="00:56:23.080" style="s2">so yes the the the postmodern way of</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.770" end="00:56:27.520" style="s2">seeing the world is a curse right now</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.080" end="00:56:29.440" style="s2">but a bird has got gold within it and we</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.520" end="00:56:33.420" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t just threw it out we should</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.440" end="00:56:39.210" style="s2">take the gold and integrate that with</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.420" end="00:56:39.210" style="s2">the previous ways of seeing the world</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.619" end="00:56:49.789" style="s2">thank you thank you all right well that</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.359" end="00:56:51.739" style="s2">brings us two minutes to the hour do we</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.789" end="00:56:55.549" style="s2">have a time or an opportunity for</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.739" end="00:56:58.299" style="s2">another question Tomas yes for me</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.549" end="00:57:02.839" style="s2">absolutely all right Peter that&#39;s cool</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.299" end="00:57:08.390" style="s2">all right let&#39;s see um Steve will you</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.839" end="00:57:10.430" style="s2">ask your question hey Thomas is about a</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.390" end="00:57:13.430" style="s2">thousand questions coming up now Stewart</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.430" end="00:57:15.529" style="s2">after your great talk so I&#39;ll try and</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.430" end="00:57:19.099" style="s2">remember it what was coming for me is</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.529" end="00:57:24.799" style="s2">the I&#39;m really curious about the</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.099" end="00:57:28.759" style="s2">emergent potentials of these what were</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.799" end="00:57:30.769" style="s2">physical retreats and I&#39;m curious if</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.759" end="00:57:34.420" style="s2">those retreats you said that had</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.769" end="00:57:34.420" style="s2">emergent potentials were they just</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.989" end="00:57:39.769" style="s2">created and they kind of went away and</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.309" end="00:57:41.809" style="s2">did their own thing or was the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.769" end="00:57:46.099" style="s2">some structure or container or river</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.809" end="00:57:48.289" style="s2">banks putting those retreats and then</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.099" end="00:57:49.460" style="s2">you know it&#39;s bringing me to two now</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.289" end="00:57:52.279" style="s2">where we&#39;ve got all these so-called</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.460" end="00:57:55.190" style="s2">digital campfires and it seems like such</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.279" end="00:57:58.069" style="s2">an emergent potential between the</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.190" end="00:58:00.799" style="s2">meetings of these different campfires</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.069" end="00:58:02.930" style="s2">and what could come in them in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.799" end="00:58:09.650" style="s2">polarity between people with different</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.930" end="00:58:11.239" style="s2">opinions yeah thank you yeah and I when</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.650" end="00:58:14.450" style="s2">I hear your question I also realized</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.239" end="00:58:17.390" style="s2">that I left another aspect of a previous</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.450" end="00:58:22.190" style="s2">question unanswered and and that was</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.390" end="00:58:23.809" style="s2">where were these retreats just personal</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.190" end="00:58:26.569" style="s2">development retreats or what what were</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.809" end="00:58:30.619" style="s2">the more aspects to them and and I think</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.569" end="00:58:32.239" style="s2">I answered that by saying that the idea</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.619" end="00:58:36.859" style="s2">behind was certainly personal</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.239" end="00:58:42.229" style="s2">development for societal development but</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.859" end="00:58:43.579" style="s2">I forgot to say that certainly in these</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.229" end="00:58:46.249" style="s2">retreats yes</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.579" end="00:58:52.630" style="s2">personal development was one major</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.249" end="00:58:52.630" style="s2">aspect but then also and so what also</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.080" end="00:58:59.290" style="s2">actually learning about the emergent</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.460" end="00:59:02.410" style="s2">technology and the emergent society and</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.290" end="00:59:05.560" style="s2">and giving the participants a feeling</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.410" end="00:59:08.350" style="s2">for that the new technology that is</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.560" end="00:59:10.240" style="s2">coming is actually up for shaping and it</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.350" end="00:59:12.250" style="s2">could be shaped for for good</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.240" end="00:59:14.440" style="s2">so today that would be actually</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.250" end="00:59:17.050" style="s2">understanding a bit about artificial</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.440" end="00:59:19.660" style="s2">intelligence machine learning other</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.050" end="00:59:22.870" style="s2">other things sort of so yeah that there</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.660" end="00:59:25.870" style="s2">was a component there of um trying to</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.870" end="00:59:28.360" style="s2">embrace and understand that we as humans</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.870" end="00:59:29.980" style="s2">can use technology for good and for bad</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.360" end="00:59:32.260" style="s2">and it&#39;s up to us to understand</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.980" end="00:59:35.680" style="s2">technology and to use it so that was one</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.260" end="00:59:38.020" style="s2">aspect but then the third aspect which</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.680" end="00:59:41.200" style="s2">was also very very important and that</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.020" end="00:59:44.860" style="s2">was giving these young adults really the</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.200" end="00:59:48.250" style="s2">tools to act incident in in civic</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.860" end="00:59:53.020" style="s2">society so they were actually taught a</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.250" end="00:59:55.960" style="s2">bit how to set up a small NGO how to</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.020" end="00:59:58.750" style="s2">start a newspaper how to write an</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.960" end="01:00:01.720" style="s2">article how to argue for for your case</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.750" end="01:00:04.170" style="s2">so today that that would have passed</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.720" end="01:00:07.600" style="s2">that could perhaps today translate into</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.170" end="01:00:09.670" style="s2">how do you start a YouTube channel how</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.600" end="01:00:14.680" style="s2">do you write a blog how do you get your</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.670" end="01:00:17.290" style="s2">ideas out there so yeah it was personal</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.680" end="01:00:22.510" style="s2">development but also get preparing and</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.290" end="01:00:25.360" style="s2">giving the tools to become active cocoa</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.510" end="01:00:28.170" style="s2">creators mm-hmm so I don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.360" end="01:00:30.490" style="s2">answers a bit your question that Steve</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.170" end="01:00:32.290" style="s2">hey on to some of a year and a little</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.490" end="01:00:35.470" style="s2">bit I&#39;m just pinging from their link to</p>

<p begin="01:01:29.110" end="01:01:39.890" style="s2">columnist the reason why I mentioned him</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.840" end="01:01:42.010" style="s2">was that that he wrote an opinion piece</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.890" end="01:01:45.920" style="s2">in The New York Times two months ago</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.010" end="01:01:49.400" style="s2">around the the Nordic secret and he also</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.920" end="01:01:53.300" style="s2">pointed that to the connection to to the</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.400" end="01:01:59.210" style="s2">US and how Rosa Parks has said in many</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.300" end="01:02:01.670" style="s2">interviews that what gave her the moral</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.210" end="01:02:03.320" style="s2">in a compass to know that even if the</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.670" end="01:02:06.200" style="s2">law of the land said that she should</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.320" end="01:02:09.200" style="s2">give up that seat on the bus in Alabama</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.200" end="01:02:11.900" style="s2">to that white person that she had the</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.200" end="01:02:14.230" style="s2">moral right to remain seated was the</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.900" end="01:02:19.970" style="s2">fact that she actually had participated</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.230" end="01:02:26.030" style="s2">in this type of Scandinavian retreats</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.970" end="01:02:29.120" style="s2">and that and in the u.s. so this concept</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.030" end="01:02:32.030" style="s2">actually traveled from Denmark where a</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.120" end="01:02:35.510" style="s2">guy called Myles Horton in the 20 spent</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.030" end="01:02:40.390" style="s2">a year to learn this concept and then he</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.510" end="01:02:42.790" style="s2">started four centers in the US the</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.390" end="01:02:46.100" style="s2">Highlander Folk School in Tennessee</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.790" end="01:02:50.030" style="s2">being the most well-known of them and</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.100" end="01:02:53.990" style="s2">these centers played a very important</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.030" end="01:02:57.200" style="s2">role in the civil rights movement in in</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.990" end="01:03:01.310" style="s2">the u.s. so that&#39;s the connection to to</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.200" end="01:03:04.810" style="s2">Rosa Parks and to and to the u.s. so</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.310" end="01:03:09.590" style="s2">yeah so the the the the building of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.810" end="01:03:12.020" style="s2">the Nordic modern democracies the civil</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.590" end="01:03:14.800" style="s2">rights movement there is something in</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.020" end="01:03:18.500" style="s2">this concept that I think we should</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.800" end="01:03:21.620" style="s2">again not not use as a blueprint but</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.500" end="01:03:24.700" style="s2">have as inspiration for what we need</p>
