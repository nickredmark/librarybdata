<p begin="00:00:10.290" end="00:00:16.190" style="s2">to Ladakh with this film project as a</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.389" end="00:00:19.970" style="s2">translator and what you saw there and</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.190" end="00:00:24.359" style="s2">how it inspired you to set up your</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.970" end="00:00:26.970" style="s2">organization and ended up okay the</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.359" end="00:00:29.869" style="s2">answer you only say my name is so it</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.970" end="00:00:29.869" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter nor me</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.920" end="00:00:37.850" style="s2">okay I first came to Ladakh or little</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.910" end="00:00:41.239" style="s2">Tibet as part of a film team as journal</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.850" end="00:00:43.730" style="s2">and anthropological son I was a linguist</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.239" end="00:00:46.640" style="s2">and I had never heard of this place</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.730" end="00:00:49.790" style="s2">called Ladakh which is actually a part</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.640" end="00:00:51.890" style="s2">of western Tibet but I was asked to go</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.790" end="00:00:54.260" style="s2">long with a documentary film team that</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.890" end="00:00:56.300" style="s2">was going to go to this remote area that</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.260" end="00:00:58.250" style="s2">had just been opened up to the Western</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.300" end="00:01:00.559" style="s2">world and they wanted someone who could</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.250" end="00:01:02.960" style="s2">pick up a bit of the language so I</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.559" end="00:01:04.970" style="s2">agreed to go along thinking I would be</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.960" end="00:01:07.960" style="s2">there for six weeks and then I&#39;d go back</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.970" end="00:01:11.119" style="s2">to Paris wells what neither linguist</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.960" end="00:01:14.420" style="s2">well I arrived in a part of the world</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.119" end="00:01:17.390" style="s2">that had not been colonized and that had</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.420" end="00:01:20.750" style="s2">not been developed in other words they</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.390" end="00:01:24.050" style="s2">had been affected by the Western world</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.750" end="00:01:29.350" style="s2">and I discovered in a high-altitude</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.050" end="00:01:32.600" style="s2">desert up at 12,000 feet in Himalayas a</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.350" end="00:01:35.509" style="s2">people who were living off very scarce</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.600" end="00:01:40.009" style="s2">resources but because there had been</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.509" end="00:01:43.430" style="s2">developing for their own lives and had</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.009" end="00:01:47.420" style="s2">traded to meet their needs not to supply</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.430" end="00:01:50.299" style="s2">a Western market they had a remarkably</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.420" end="00:01:54.710" style="s2">high standard of living large beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.299" end="00:01:58.280" style="s2">houses beautiful jewelry and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.710" end="00:02:01.549" style="s2">discovered more leisure and more</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.280" end="00:02:04.130" style="s2">pleasure than we had in the West so I</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.549" end="00:02:07.070" style="s2">became fascinated by this culture in</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.130" end="00:02:09.920" style="s2">these people I stayed on when the film</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.070" end="00:02:14.690" style="s2">was finished and I became fluent in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.920" end="00:02:17.030" style="s2">language and I over the next few years I</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.690" end="00:02:19.910" style="s2">was working on writing down the language</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.030" end="00:02:23.150" style="s2">for the first time and I came in contact</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.910" end="00:02:26.470" style="s2">with people who I found were also the</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.150" end="00:02:30.260" style="s2">happiest people I had ever encountered I</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.470" end="00:02:32.989" style="s2">also saw that the area having been</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.260" end="00:02:36.500" style="s2">thrown open to the west to tourism and</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.989" end="00:02:39.860" style="s2">to change from the outside was being now</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.500" end="00:02:40.569" style="s2">developed by the Indian government in</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.860" end="00:02:44.290" style="s2">this part</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.569" end="00:02:48.700" style="s2">to that lost political to India and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.290" end="00:02:53.709" style="s2">saw that the development in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.700" end="00:02:56.980" style="s2">following years created unemployment</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.709" end="00:03:00.780" style="s2">which hadn&#39;t existed for thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.980" end="00:03:04.989" style="s2">years no one in front of none whatsoever</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.780" end="00:03:08.489" style="s2">in creating unemployment in educating</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.989" end="00:03:11.829" style="s2">young people for jobs that weren&#39;t there</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.489" end="00:03:14.560" style="s2">this process also created intense</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.829" end="00:03:16.870" style="s2">competition a competition that again</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.560" end="00:03:20.349" style="s2">hadn&#39;t existed for five hundred years a</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.870" end="00:03:23.169" style="s2">thousand years and the cause of that</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.349" end="00:03:26.879" style="s2">competition local people started</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.169" end="00:03:29.859" style="s2">fighting each other suddenly differences</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.879" end="00:03:31.840" style="s2">different groups particularly Buddhists</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.859" end="00:03:34.750" style="s2">and Muslims who had lived peacefully</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.840" end="00:03:39.250" style="s2">side by side for for five hundred years</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.750" end="00:03:43.989" style="s2">were fighting each other so within about</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.250" end="00:03:47.769" style="s2">a decade the development process had led</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.989" end="00:03:49.120" style="s2">to unemployment and conflict that had</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.769" end="00:03:52.359" style="s2">never existed before</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.120" end="00:03:55.419" style="s2">at the same time this process was</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.359" end="00:03:58.989" style="s2">creating solutions of a kind that had</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.419" end="00:04:01.479" style="s2">never existed before so I started</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.989" end="00:04:03.729" style="s2">working with the local people to provide</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.479" end="00:04:06.489" style="s2">information about the fact that in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.729" end="00:04:07.750" style="s2">West and around the rest of the world</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.489" end="00:04:10.319" style="s2">there were more and more people</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.750" end="00:04:15.370" style="s2">questioning this development model and</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.319" end="00:04:17.590" style="s2">so my organization Isak for the last</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.370" end="00:04:20.530" style="s2">three decades has been trying to raise</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.590" end="00:04:23.260" style="s2">awareness around the world in both north</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.530" end="00:04:26.620" style="s2">and south about the urgent need to</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.260" end="00:04:31.180" style="s2">change the direction of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.620" end="00:04:35.800" style="s2">away from a fossil fuel-based</p>
