<p begin="00:00:13.139" end="00:00:17.880" style="s2">came up with a revolutionary theory that</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.509" end="00:00:21.350" style="s2">links together psychology neuroscience</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.880" end="00:00:24.840" style="s2">and evolutionary biology it was called</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.350" end="00:00:27.330" style="s2">polyvagal and focused on the vagus the</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.840" end="00:00:29.760" style="s2">longest nerve in the body that links</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.330" end="00:00:32.669" style="s2">together all the major organs and also</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.760" end="00:00:34.559" style="s2">connected to the face and voice for the</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.669" end="00:00:36.780" style="s2">first time there was a theory that</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.559" end="00:00:38.489" style="s2">explained how our own body and mind are</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.780" end="00:00:40.770" style="s2">intimately connected to our facial</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.489" end="00:00:44.879" style="s2">expressions voice and social engagement</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.770" end="00:00:47.879" style="s2">system and therefore to others how the</p>

<p begin="00:00:47.879" end="00:00:53.789" style="s2">safety how we&#39;re curious and open to new</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.550" end="00:00:56.039" style="s2">information and experiences and how if</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.789" end="00:00:58.199" style="s2">we&#39;re not feeling safe then we fall into</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.039" end="00:01:01.079" style="s2">defensiveness we start to see everything</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.199" end="00:01:04.080" style="s2">unfamiliar as a threat and are unable to</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.079" end="00:01:05.220" style="s2">take in new information so Steven thank</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.080" end="00:01:06.869" style="s2">you very much for making the time for</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.220" end="00:01:08.280" style="s2">this interview you know David thank you</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.869" end="00:01:10.439" style="s2">very much for inviting me</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.280" end="00:01:13.650" style="s2">so in this interview I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.439" end="00:01:15.900" style="s2">interested to talk about how your theory</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.650" end="00:01:17.670" style="s2">polyvagal theory applies to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.900" end="00:01:21.270" style="s2">polarization that we&#39;re seeing around us</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.670" end="00:01:22.890" style="s2">could do you outline your what what is</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.270" end="00:01:25.290" style="s2">polyvagal theory and how does it apply</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.890" end="00:01:27.080" style="s2">to the subject polyvagal theory from the</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.290" end="00:01:30.150" style="s2">perspective our dialogue is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.080" end="00:01:32.970" style="s2">neurobiological theory that enables us</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.150" end="00:01:34.920" style="s2">to understand why and how humans need to</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.970" end="00:01:36.360" style="s2">connect with each other and if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.920" end="00:01:39.060" style="s2">connect with each other what are the</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.360" end="00:01:41.220" style="s2">consequences both to our body meaning</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.060" end="00:01:43.649" style="s2">our physiology and our health but also</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.220" end="00:01:45.899" style="s2">to our mental health it&#39;s basically a</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.649" end="00:01:49.170" style="s2">theory that explains brain body</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.899" end="00:01:52.740" style="s2">relationships and how we can manipulate</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.170" end="00:01:55.770" style="s2">our mental perspective by shifts in our</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.740" end="00:01:58.049" style="s2">body and how our mental perspective can</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.770" end="00:02:00.570" style="s2">change our body and vice versa it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.049" end="00:02:02.790" style="s2">it&#39;s a direction of it&#39;s a model that</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.570" end="00:02:05.820" style="s2">has by directionality between brain and</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.790" end="00:02:08.550" style="s2">body and it enables us to use as</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.820" end="00:02:11.160" style="s2">creative science of how social behavior</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.550" end="00:02:12.700" style="s2">supports health and how being healthy</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.160" end="00:02:17.049" style="s2">enables us to be more</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.700" end="00:02:20.659" style="s2">just to talk about what polyvagal theory</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.049" end="00:02:23.569" style="s2">actually means in in practice just like</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.659" end="00:02:26.330" style="s2">to break that down in terms of the vagus</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.569" end="00:02:28.280" style="s2">nerve and in a very simple way how do we</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.330" end="00:02:30.019" style="s2">orient ourselves and how does how does</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.280" end="00:02:33.140" style="s2">polyvagal theory illustrate that</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.019" end="00:02:35.209" style="s2">orienting process polyvagal theory has</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.140" end="00:02:37.970" style="s2">several features or we&#39;ll go through a</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.209" end="00:02:40.099" style="s2">few of them the important the first</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.970" end="00:02:42.560" style="s2">important one is that it gives us a way</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.099" end="00:02:45.799" style="s2">of organizing our own poverty reactions</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.560" end="00:02:48.590" style="s2">it really emphasizes that the neural</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.799" end="00:02:50.989" style="s2">which really means the brain regulation</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.590" end="00:02:53.060" style="s2">of the autonomic nervous system the</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.989" end="00:02:55.370" style="s2">neural system that regulates the the</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.060" end="00:02:58.940" style="s2">organs within our body followed an</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.370" end="00:03:01.609" style="s2">evolutionary tradition trajectory so we</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.940" end="00:03:05.470" style="s2">had a very primitive autonomic system</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.609" end="00:03:08.510" style="s2">that really was about maintaining</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.470" end="00:03:11.329" style="s2">metabolic resources so it was very much</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.510" end="00:03:14.500" style="s2">oriented in if there was enough oxygen</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.329" end="00:03:17.510" style="s2">of food it just kind of shut us down</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.500" end="00:03:20.299" style="s2">then with evolution from these ancient</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.510" end="00:03:23.690" style="s2">vertebrates that had only one a very</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.299" end="00:03:26.049" style="s2">ancient old vagal circuit and that old</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.690" end="00:03:28.099" style="s2">vagal circuit was unmyelinated and</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.049" end="00:03:30.950" style="s2">myelination is really the fatty</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.099" end="00:03:32.989" style="s2">substance that coats a nerve and if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.950" end="00:03:35.230" style="s2">myelinated it could actually convey</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.989" end="00:03:38.150" style="s2">these signals more efficiently and more</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.230" end="00:03:40.190" style="s2">specifically but in the very ancient</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.150" end="00:03:43.040" style="s2">vertebrates they only have his older</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.190" end="00:03:45.260" style="s2">dorsal vagal system but we still have it</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.040" end="00:03:48.919" style="s2">it&#39;s the primary system that still goes</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.260" end="00:03:50.629" style="s2">to our gut and the major defense</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.919" end="00:03:52.579" style="s2">response of that the autonomic nervous</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.629" end="00:03:55.129" style="s2">system for these ancient vertebrates was</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.579" end="00:03:58.400" style="s2">basically shutting down immobilizing</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.129" end="00:04:00.440" style="s2">death feigning through evolution a</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.400" end="00:04:03.319" style="s2">sympathetic nervous system came onboard</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.440" end="00:04:06.139" style="s2">and that one was a spinal sympathetics</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.319" end="00:04:08.810" style="s2">that came on with the bony fish and you</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.139" end="00:04:10.549" style="s2">can see them moving and even stopping so</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.810" end="00:04:12.980" style="s2">now you have an autonomic pounce</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.549" end="00:04:15.070" style="s2">I hope mobilization through the</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.980" end="00:04:18.639" style="s2">sympathetic nervous system and</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.070" end="00:04:21.729" style="s2">immobilization at old Vegas and</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.639" end="00:04:23.590" style="s2">then what you have with mumbles and this</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.729" end="00:04:24.340" style="s2">is the interesting part of polyvagal</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.590" end="00:04:26.139" style="s2">theories</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.340" end="00:04:29.050" style="s2">something strange is something a</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.139" end="00:04:31.300" style="s2">miraculously occurs with the transition</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.050" end="00:04:34.120" style="s2">from the ancient as stink extinct</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.300" end="00:04:36.669" style="s2">reptiles to mammals and that is you have</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.120" end="00:04:39.849" style="s2">a newer vagal circuit that&#39;s bile in it</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.669" end="00:04:41.560" style="s2">that helps calm or coordinate these the</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.849" end="00:04:44.409" style="s2">older veil circuit to support</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.560" end="00:04:45.939" style="s2">homeostasis and to enable some things to</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.409" end="00:04:49.539" style="s2">work without giving you into fight or</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.939" end="00:04:51.490" style="s2">flight but the other miraculous part is</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.539" end="00:04:54.310" style="s2">that the area of the brain that</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.490" end="00:04:56.020" style="s2">regulates that pathway the vagus is not</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.310" end="00:04:58.659" style="s2">the same that regulates the old Vegas</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.020" end="00:05:00.520" style="s2">going to the gut it&#39;s linked to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.659" end="00:05:02.439" style="s2">nerves in the area of the brainstem is</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.520" end="00:05:04.719" style="s2">linked to the part that regulates the</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.439" end="00:05:06.879" style="s2">nerves they regulate your face the</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.719" end="00:05:09.819" style="s2">muscles of your face and head it</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.879" end="00:05:12.460" style="s2">regulates your social engagement system</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.819" end="00:05:15.009" style="s2">your ingest of system the way you touch</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.460" end="00:05:16.870" style="s2">and connect with the world so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.009" end="00:05:19.960" style="s2">really this kind of remarkable</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.870" end="00:05:22.960" style="s2">transition where our heart became</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.960" end="00:05:25.900" style="s2">connected in a normal way to the the</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.960" end="00:05:27.879" style="s2">nerves that regulate our voice the</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.900" end="00:05:30.580" style="s2">intonation of our voice our facial</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.879" end="00:05:33.849" style="s2">expressions and even our ability to</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.580" end="00:05:35.529" style="s2">extract information by listening so</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.849" end="00:05:37.960" style="s2">there are muscles in our middle ear to</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.529" end="00:05:39.940" style="s2">our facial expressivity and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.960" end="00:05:43.629" style="s2">intonation of our voice so now we</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.940" end="00:05:45.879" style="s2">project of our heart in our voice and</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.629" end="00:05:49.419" style="s2">people know that intuitively they</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.879" end="00:05:51.909" style="s2">respond that way we project our feelings</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.419" end="00:05:53.469" style="s2">in our face so these become the</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.909" end="00:05:55.889" style="s2">important parts of how we make</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.469" end="00:05:58.419" style="s2">connections with others but the</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.889" end="00:06:00.599" style="s2">bidirectionality so that we&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.419" end="00:06:03.550" style="s2">sense of a person is in a physiological</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.599" end="00:06:05.589" style="s2">destabilized way their voice is very</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.550" end="00:06:07.479" style="s2">different and we often in for a good</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.589" end="00:06:09.580" style="s2">therapist or great human beings and good</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.479" end="00:06:12.729" style="s2">parents or good teachers we know that</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.580" end="00:06:15.089" style="s2">and we calm them and how do we calm them</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.729" end="00:06:17.589" style="s2">it&#39;s not the words that are powerful</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.089" end="00:06:19.030" style="s2">it&#39;s how we use the words it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.589" end="00:06:21.820" style="s2">intonation of her voice</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.030" end="00:06:25.060" style="s2">so polyvagal theory emphasizes these</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.820" end="00:06:28.480" style="s2">evolutionary stages but also emphasizes</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.060" end="00:06:31.180" style="s2">that under challenge under demands at</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.480" end="00:06:34.150" style="s2">the illness or threat our autonomic</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.180" end="00:06:36.700" style="s2">nervous system shifts state it moves</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.150" end="00:06:39.010" style="s2">from this social engagement safe stage</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.700" end="00:06:41.320" style="s2">where we are connected with others it</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.010" end="00:06:43.360" style="s2">moves to defensive States and we have</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.320" end="00:06:45.370" style="s2">two defensive States and this is really</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.360" end="00:06:45.910" style="s2">one of the important points of polyvagal</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.370" end="00:06:48.640" style="s2">theory</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.910" end="00:06:50.470" style="s2">prior to polyvagal theory most people</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.640" end="00:06:53.230" style="s2">thought we only had one defensive state</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.470" end="00:06:55.600" style="s2">then that was a stress or a fight/flight</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.230" end="00:06:57.070" style="s2">sympathetic state and even people who</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.600" end="00:06:59.290" style="s2">had been traumatized who can be</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.070" end="00:07:00.910" style="s2">immobilized by the trauma their</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.290" end="00:07:02.320" style="s2">therapist would say oh you must have</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.910" end="00:07:04.690" style="s2">been frightened you must have been</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.320" end="00:07:07.120" style="s2">mobilizing but they kept on looking for</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.690" end="00:07:08.740" style="s2">this sympathetic response and the client</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.120" end="00:07:11.110" style="s2">said that&#39;s not how it experienced it</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.740" end="00:07:13.330" style="s2">that&#39;s because when we experienced a</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.110" end="00:07:15.880" style="s2">life threat for some of us not all of us</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.330" end="00:07:18.640" style="s2">our body goes into this very very</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.880" end="00:07:20.919" style="s2">ancient immobilization response we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.640" end="00:07:23.229" style="s2">very much like a mouse and the jaws of a</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.919" end="00:07:25.720" style="s2">cat with a mouse will just literally</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.229" end="00:07:28.630" style="s2">pass out and lose all muscle tone and</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.720" end="00:07:31.300" style="s2">many people who have survived trauma</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.630" end="00:07:33.640" style="s2">their body has gone into that state and</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.300" end="00:07:35.950" style="s2">they&#39;ve not found a voice or had</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.640" end="00:07:38.740" style="s2">difficulty finding a voice to explain</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.950" end="00:07:42.400" style="s2">the mechanisms of it so frequently under</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.740" end="00:07:45.400" style="s2">demands our bodies don&#39;t support fight</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.400" end="00:07:46.960" style="s2">or flight and in our culture when that</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.400" end="00:07:49.390" style="s2">doesn&#39;t it when we don&#39;t have that</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.960" end="00:07:52.360" style="s2">resource the people often blame for not</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.390" end="00:07:54.100" style="s2">fighting or not fleeing and so by</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.360" end="00:07:56.650" style="s2">explaining this was probably vagal</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.100" end="00:07:58.660" style="s2">theory it provides a validation for many</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.650" end="00:08:03.850" style="s2">people&#39;s experiences and how does that</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.660" end="00:08:06.100" style="s2">apply to - polarization and - connection</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.850" end="00:08:09.430" style="s2">let&#39;s start with this whole notion you</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.100" end="00:08:11.130" style="s2">have polarization in part because there</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.430" end="00:08:13.750" style="s2">is some type of threat that people</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.130" end="00:08:16.570" style="s2">perceive or their bodies respond</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.750" end="00:08:19.660" style="s2">so let&#39;s now deal with this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.570" end="00:08:21.820" style="s2">threat from a polyvagal perspective poly</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.660" end="00:08:24.910" style="s2">vehicle theory doesn&#39;t like to use words</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.820" end="00:08:28.000" style="s2">like perception because perception is</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.910" end="00:08:29.710" style="s2">very cognitive term polyvagal theory</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.000" end="00:08:32.589" style="s2">uses a term called neuro</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.710" end="00:08:35.890" style="s2">which is the nervous systems decision or</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.589" end="00:08:38.380" style="s2">evaluation of risk in the environment so</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.890" end="00:08:41.500" style="s2">if the your honor if your nervous system</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.380" end="00:08:43.120" style="s2">detects risk of danger you shift</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.500" end="00:08:45.550" style="s2">physiological state to be more</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.120" end="00:08:48.190" style="s2">sympathetically innovative which gives</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.550" end="00:08:52.180" style="s2">you the power and strength to run or</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.190" end="00:08:54.220" style="s2">define if you react as if there is no</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.180" end="00:08:57.640" style="s2">way you can get out like your enclosed</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.220" end="00:09:01.240" style="s2">in a small area or your physically much</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.640" end="00:09:03.730" style="s2">smaller or your body might now move into</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.240" end="00:09:06.430" style="s2">this life threat shutting down response</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.730" end="00:09:09.310" style="s2">both of those are autonomic responses</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.430" end="00:09:12.970" style="s2">and our body has this capacity to go to</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.310" end="00:09:15.100" style="s2">those stages in an adaptive strategy to</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.970" end="00:09:17.680" style="s2">save our lives so it&#39;s not like oh I</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.100" end="00:09:20.680" style="s2">gave up so I just shut down now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.680" end="00:09:22.510" style="s2">really angry that I gave up your body is</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.680" end="00:09:24.100" style="s2">making that decision and once you</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.510" end="00:09:27.190" style="s2">understand that these are more on a</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.100" end="00:09:29.740" style="s2">neural reflux level then aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.190" end="00:09:31.959" style="s2">shame and blame change well let&#39;s move</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.740" end="00:09:34.930" style="s2">back to this notion of perceived threat</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.959" end="00:09:37.209" style="s2">or a no reception of threat if we have a</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.930" end="00:09:40.600" style="s2">neuro ception of threat our nervous</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.209" end="00:09:44.140" style="s2">system loses its capacity to be socially</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.600" end="00:09:47.709" style="s2">engaged with others so we start to see</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.140" end="00:09:50.350" style="s2">others with a bias of threat threatening</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.709" end="00:09:52.660" style="s2">us and then this goes into the next</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.350" end="00:09:54.600" style="s2">level the issue of the world that were</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.660" end="00:09:57.820" style="s2">in now which is a very polarized world</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.600" end="00:09:59.770" style="s2">that we have confused what it means to</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.820" end="00:10:02.410" style="s2">be safe and that&#39;s part of where the</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.770" end="00:10:04.540" style="s2">polarization occurs the polarization</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.410" end="00:10:07.270" style="s2">starts when people think that I can be</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.540" end="00:10:09.220" style="s2">safe if I remove threat and I see us</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.270" end="00:10:11.050" style="s2">threatening you&#39;re not coming into my</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.220" end="00:10:13.839" style="s2">country you&#39;re not coming into my town</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.050" end="00:10:16.329" style="s2">you&#39;re not marrying my daughter you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.839" end="00:10:18.970" style="s2">all these features are basically we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.329" end="00:10:22.600" style="s2">going to remove the threat but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.970" end="00:10:25.540" style="s2">not enough or bodies want more that will</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.600" end="00:10:28.750" style="s2">never make an individual or community or</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.540" end="00:10:31.570" style="s2">society feel safe safety comes when the</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.750" end="00:10:33.339" style="s2">features of safety are being presented</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.570" end="00:10:36.070" style="s2">to them on a day to day basis the</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.339" end="00:10:38.620" style="s2">ability of people engaging them smiling</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.070" end="00:10:40.690" style="s2">at them with positive gestures the</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.620" end="00:10:42.170" style="s2">intonation z&#39; of voices that are</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.690" end="00:10:44.660" style="s2">reassuring</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.170" end="00:10:47.690" style="s2">and witnessing those make people feel</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.660" end="00:10:49.700" style="s2">safe so it&#39;s not really the politics we</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.690" end="00:10:51.860" style="s2">have to also talk about educational</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.700" end="00:10:55.790" style="s2">systems let&#39;s talk about medical care</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.860" end="00:10:57.470" style="s2">how often do do the educators how often</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.790" end="00:10:59.990" style="s2">are they instructed or their medical</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.470" end="00:11:02.660" style="s2">providers instructed that the way they</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.990" end="00:11:05.570" style="s2">look at the students or their patients</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.660" end="00:11:07.670" style="s2">the way they use their voice is as</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.570" end="00:11:10.250" style="s2">important as everything else they do</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.670" end="00:11:12.560" style="s2">they&#39;re not does not part the curriculum</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.250" end="00:11:15.560" style="s2">and that&#39;s what I think polyvagal theory</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.560" end="00:11:17.990" style="s2">could bring to medical treatments and</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.560" end="00:11:19.820" style="s2">education is the understanding that if</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.990" end="00:11:22.130" style="s2">you want people to get better if you</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.820" end="00:11:23.840" style="s2">want people to learn they have to feel</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.130" end="00:11:26.750" style="s2">safe in the context in which you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.840" end="00:11:29.060" style="s2">delivering your services and how does</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.750" end="00:11:32.690" style="s2">this theory or theoretical framework</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.060" end="00:11:36.050" style="s2">apply to say conflict and mediation well</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.690" end="00:11:38.810" style="s2">it defines conflict doesn&#39;t in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.050" end="00:11:40.940" style="s2">that we&#39;ve conflict so people feel that</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.810" end="00:11:45.590" style="s2">there is a threat or their bodies feel</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.940" end="00:11:48.410" style="s2">as a threat to have remediation you have</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.590" end="00:11:51.050" style="s2">to provide sufficient views of safety so</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.410" end="00:11:53.450" style="s2">that you now get into a dialogue now a</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.050" end="00:11:56.330" style="s2">dialogue by nature or being the word</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.450" end="00:11:58.760" style="s2">implies some reciprocity in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.330" end="00:12:00.830" style="s2">interaction and when you do rest we have</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.760" end="00:12:02.420" style="s2">reciprocity in the action you have a</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.830" end="00:12:04.400" style="s2">listening component as well as</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.420" end="00:12:07.580" style="s2">expressive component so you have a</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.400" end="00:12:09.920" style="s2">witnessing component so it part of I</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.580" end="00:12:12.500" style="s2">think the major issue of conflict is</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.920" end="00:12:14.870" style="s2">that people don&#39;t listen to each other</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.500" end="00:12:17.270" style="s2">so they&#39;re not witnessing and if people</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.870" end="00:12:19.310" style="s2">don&#39;t listen to you when you strike a</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.270" end="00:12:21.950" style="s2">chalk express something or let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.310" end="00:12:23.840" style="s2">you&#39;re even a child and you&#39;re not being</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.950" end="00:12:26.750" style="s2">listened to what happens to your</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.840" end="00:12:29.030" style="s2">physiological state will you become very</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.750" end="00:12:30.890" style="s2">uncomfortable you&#39;ll become frustrated</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.030" end="00:12:32.570" style="s2">and as you get older with those same</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.890" end="00:12:35.540" style="s2">feelings you become angry and</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.570" end="00:12:38.330" style="s2">belligerent and so we have to understand</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.540" end="00:12:41.000" style="s2">that being listened to being witnessed</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.330" end="00:12:42.830" style="s2">not necessarily being agreed with but</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.000" end="00:12:45.860" style="s2">being witnessed and appreciated for what</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.830" end="00:12:48.170" style="s2">you were saying is really part of our</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.860" end="00:12:52.010" style="s2">birthright it&#39;s something that we scream</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.170" end="00:12:54.120" style="s2">to do AB and polarization is occurs when</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.010" end="00:12:59.660" style="s2">people who aren&#39;t listened to there now</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.120" end="00:12:59.660" style="s2">witnessed and they feel marginalized and</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.720" end="00:13:05.420" style="s2">where do you see that happening at the</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.740" end="00:13:10.529" style="s2">moment in in culture I see it happening</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.420" end="00:13:13.830" style="s2">slowly I see to me for my own experience</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.529" end="00:13:16.110" style="s2">the shock has been the interest in my</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.830" end="00:13:18.300" style="s2">own ideas in the ideas of the polyvagal</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.110" end="00:13:20.820" style="s2">theory and the fact that people in</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.300" end="00:13:23.670" style="s2">education people in medicine and even</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.820" end="00:13:25.589" style="s2">people in philosophy became interested</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.670" end="00:13:27.750" style="s2">in so it&#39;s not really the psychologists</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.589" end="00:13:30.089" style="s2">or the neuroscientists that people who</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.750" end="00:13:31.980" style="s2">are living their lives said ah this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.089" end="00:13:35.070" style="s2">an interesting theory it explains my</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.980" end="00:13:37.290" style="s2">experiences or what I would say to them</p>

<p begin="00:15:21.320" end="00:15:26.120" style="s2">people are listening I hope that the</p>

<p begin="00:15:42.380" end="00:15:47.900" style="s2">efficient we have better behavioral</p>

<p begin="00:15:47.900" end="00:15:52.310" style="s2">regulation is really the basis upon</p>

<p begin="00:15:52.310" end="00:15:57.980" style="s2">and the basis upon which we can learn so</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.490" end="00:16:00.380" style="s2">we can&#39;t sit in a classroom unless we</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.980" end="00:16:02.570" style="s2">can regulate our state and we are</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.380" end="00:16:05.750" style="s2">starting to find out really that lots of</p>

<p begin="00:16:05.750" end="00:16:10.610" style="s2">which are massive in our culture are</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.580" end="00:16:12.470" style="s2">really disorders of state regulation so</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.610" end="00:16:14.090" style="s2">polyvagal theory provides a different</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.470" end="00:16:18.280" style="s2">perspective for many of the attributes</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.090" end="00:16:20.870" style="s2">of mental illness and mental health and</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.280" end="00:16:24.680" style="s2">you just touched on it a little bit but</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.870" end="00:16:26.060" style="s2">social media and if if polyvagal theory</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.680" end="00:16:28.010" style="s2">is all about the necessity for</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.060" end="00:16:29.540" style="s2">face-to-face contact and for regulating</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.010" end="00:16:32.060" style="s2">ourselves in connection with other</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.540" end="00:16:33.680" style="s2">people what does social media do to that</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.060" end="00:16:36.440" style="s2">when we&#39;re basically communicating</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.680" end="00:16:38.360" style="s2">through a screen and we&#39;re well it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.440" end="00:16:40.370" style="s2">interesting question because for those</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.360" end="00:16:43.300" style="s2">of us who initially our early part of</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.370" end="00:16:46.550" style="s2">our lives was really solely face to face</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.300" end="00:16:48.410" style="s2">even the telephone wasn&#39;t that bad</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.550" end="00:16:52.670" style="s2">because we could tell by intonation of</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.410" end="00:16:56.270" style="s2">voice I have found that Skype is better</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.670" end="00:16:58.640" style="s2">than just talking so and I have become</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.270" end="00:17:03.770" style="s2">more comfortable with interviews even on</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.640" end="00:17:07.400" style="s2">skype resume so these types of social</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.770" end="00:17:09.320" style="s2">media technologies are infiltrating our</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.400" end="00:17:10.750" style="s2">life I don&#39;t think they replace the</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.320" end="00:17:13.750" style="s2">one-to-one interaction</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.750" end="00:17:15.819" style="s2">I often like to say that we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.750" end="00:17:18.640" style="s2">to have these one-to-one interactions</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.819" end="00:17:23.079" style="s2">all the time but we need to have some of</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.640" end="00:17:24.970" style="s2">it so if we have a good nervous system</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.079" end="00:17:27.520" style="s2">of our nervous system has been well</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.970" end="00:17:30.130" style="s2">developed that&#39;s a good parenting good</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.520" end="00:17:32.919" style="s2">friends good social interactions it</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.130" end="00:17:35.890" style="s2">gives us the resilience to then go off</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.919" end="00:17:38.760" style="s2">and do things on our own to be bolder to</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.890" end="00:17:41.770" style="s2">be more creative and not to need</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.760" end="00:17:44.500" style="s2">constant coagulation so there&#39;s almost a</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.770" end="00:17:46.929" style="s2">paradox the more opportunities you have</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.500" end="00:17:49.630" style="s2">as you develop the more resilient you be</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.929" end="00:17:52.840" style="s2">you are I should grow up and the more</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.630" end="00:17:54.549" style="s2">bold and you can do things but is there</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.840" end="00:17:56.679" style="s2">a problem with social media and the sort</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.549" end="00:17:58.750" style="s2">of the low bandwidth we&#39;re not face to</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.679" end="00:18:00.730" style="s2">face much of the time it&#39;s very do you</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.750" end="00:18:02.470" style="s2">think it adds to the kind of division or</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.730" end="00:18:05.830" style="s2">isolation that we&#39;re experiencing I</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.470" end="00:18:10.210" style="s2">think it adds to a misunderstanding of</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.830" end="00:18:11.919" style="s2">queues where people are misunderstanding</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.210" end="00:18:14.440" style="s2">what people are saying and they may be</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.919" end="00:18:16.510" style="s2">listening more to the words and less to</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.440" end="00:18:20.500" style="s2">the facial expressivity and the</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.510" end="00:18:25.000" style="s2">intonation I think they&#39;re false cues</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.500" end="00:18:27.159" style="s2">coming out there and but I have children</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.000" end="00:18:29.830" style="s2">and they are adults now and they would</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.159" end="00:18:31.929" style="s2">argue with me that social media plays a</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.830" end="00:18:34.179" style="s2">positive role in their lives and they</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.929" end="00:18:38.470" style="s2">have friendships that are maintained</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.179" end="00:18:41.230" style="s2">because of social media and they use it</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.470" end="00:18:43.809" style="s2">in a different way and then I would use</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.230" end="00:18:46.990" style="s2">it I&#39;m not comfortable with using it I</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.809" end="00:18:50.559" style="s2">don&#39;t use Twitter and it&#39;s just down my</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.990" end="00:18:54.100" style="s2">world I use email a lot and I do text</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.559" end="00:18:58.570" style="s2">occasionally but I think it is an hour</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.100" end="00:19:01.419" style="s2">bandwidth and it&#39;s it could be useful if</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.570" end="00:19:03.549" style="s2">we have relationships already so</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.419" end="00:19:04.809" style="s2">maintaining them but I think where my</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.549" end="00:19:07.600" style="s2">kids are using it it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.809" end="00:19:09.280" style="s2">maintaining relationships with the</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.600" end="00:19:11.230" style="s2">individuals they had worked with before</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.280" end="00:19:13.270" style="s2">or gone to school with before so they</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.230" end="00:19:15.270" style="s2">already have friendship relationships so</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.270" end="00:19:18.929" style="s2">it&#39;s keeping them together</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.270" end="00:19:22.140" style="s2">I feel that the act of looking at a</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.929" end="00:19:25.260" style="s2">smartphone or looking at something</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.140" end="00:19:27.840" style="s2">actually a small screen actually forces</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.260" end="00:19:30.900" style="s2">certain physiological shifts like up for</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.840" end="00:19:34.110" style="s2">our face gets really good contorted as</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.900" end="00:19:36.330" style="s2">we attend to it that this is not a</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.110" end="00:19:40.260" style="s2">comforting physiological state</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.330" end="00:19:44.340" style="s2">I think larger screens larger monitors</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.260" end="00:19:47.970" style="s2">are easier on our physiology and I think</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.340" end="00:19:50.429" style="s2">our facial expressions reflect that so</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.970" end="00:19:52.230" style="s2">if you look if you do Skype or something</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.429" end="00:19:54.929" style="s2">on a large monitor people&#39;s faces look</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.230" end="00:19:57.330" style="s2">reasonably normal if you start looking</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.929" end="00:20:00.240" style="s2">down at this little thing you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.330" end="00:20:04.110" style="s2">actually struggling and your body shifts</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.240" end="00:20:06.110" style="s2">state one of the big light bulb moments</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.110" end="00:20:08.750" style="s2">for me when I was thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.110" end="00:20:11.100" style="s2">polyvagal theory and how it applies to</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.750" end="00:20:13.320" style="s2">cultural and political conversation was</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.100" end="00:20:15.960" style="s2">when one of my teachers talked about</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.320" end="00:20:19.490" style="s2">curiosity and how curiosity was a key</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.960" end="00:20:22.380" style="s2">value and how its moderated how</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.490" end="00:20:23.880" style="s2">polyvagal theory can influence the</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.380" end="00:20:26.280" style="s2">understanding what curiosity means</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.880" end="00:20:28.380" style="s2">because when we&#39;re having a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.280" end="00:20:29.640" style="s2">with someone when we&#39;re curious there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.380" end="00:20:31.080" style="s2">a potential for kind of new information</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.640" end="00:20:32.820" style="s2">and there&#39;s a potential to contain to</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.080" end="00:20:34.620" style="s2">our minds when we stop being curious</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.820" end="00:20:38.370" style="s2">then I kind of closed off and we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.620" end="00:20:40.559" style="s2">available for a generative conversation</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.370" end="00:20:42.420" style="s2">so their important point you&#39;re bringing</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.559" end="00:20:45.690" style="s2">up and let&#39;s start with this whole issue</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.420" end="00:20:47.600" style="s2">of availability or being available I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.690" end="00:20:50.580" style="s2">been playing with this whole issue of</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.600" end="00:20:53.280" style="s2">vulnerability versus availability and</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.580" end="00:20:54.929" style="s2">what we find out in certain cultural</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.280" end="00:20:58.110" style="s2">environments if we feel that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.929" end="00:20:59.340" style="s2">concerned about evaluated we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.110" end="00:21:01.110" style="s2">concerned about our own vulnerability</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.340" end="00:21:03.000" style="s2">and when we&#39;re in that state of</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.110" end="00:21:05.850" style="s2">vulnerability we&#39;re not truly available</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.000" end="00:21:08.309" style="s2">and we&#39;re not expansive in the way we</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.850" end="00:21:11.210" style="s2">think were aggressive and we try to hold</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.309" end="00:21:13.880" style="s2">on to our existing beliefs or knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.210" end="00:21:16.100" style="s2">but when we feel safe in the environment</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.880" end="00:21:19.040" style="s2">and we&#39;re accessible for a true</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.100" end="00:21:21.320" style="s2">interaction the interaction is much well</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.040" end="00:21:23.720" style="s2">more welcoming for ideas that are</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.320" end="00:21:26.330" style="s2">divergent even with our own so we listen</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.720" end="00:21:30.140" style="s2">we witness who may not necessarily agree</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.330" end="00:21:35.180" style="s2">but we learn so curiosity is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.140" end="00:21:37.850" style="s2">bonus points or bonus objects are bonus</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.180" end="00:21:40.970" style="s2">values of having a physiological state</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.850" end="00:21:43.970" style="s2">that is welcoming if you are a defensive</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.970" end="00:21:46.670" style="s2">person if your state of concern and you</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.970" end="00:21:49.220" style="s2">feel that your role is to reject because</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.670" end="00:21:52.930" style="s2">that gives you a power then you&#39;ll never</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.220" end="00:21:55.640" style="s2">be curious you know I I speak from a</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.930" end="00:21:58.310" style="s2">history of being an academic and</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.640" end="00:22:00.080" style="s2">academics know their power and their</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.310" end="00:22:02.660" style="s2">power is not necessarily in being</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.080" end="00:22:05.360" style="s2">curious their power is being skeptical</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.660" end="00:22:08.720" style="s2">and the skeptic is very easy to be a</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.360" end="00:22:11.330" style="s2">skeptic you just say no prove it to me</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.720" end="00:22:13.550" style="s2">I don&#39;t understand it now that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.330" end="00:22:15.650" style="s2">very interesting life the interesting</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.550" end="00:22:17.450" style="s2">life is to learn from whatever you can</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.650" end="00:22:19.880" style="s2">tell me maybe I&#39;ll learn something maybe</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.450" end="00:22:21.760" style="s2">it&#39;ll shift my views but I have to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.880" end="00:22:25.400" style="s2">welcoming for that I have to be in a</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.760" end="00:22:27.230" style="s2">state that I feel that I&#39;m not gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.400" end="00:22:29.930" style="s2">hurt my body has to feel it&#39;s not going</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.230" end="00:22:33.520" style="s2">to be hurt not really my cognitions so</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.930" end="00:22:37.160" style="s2">this curiosity is really a almost a</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.520" end="00:22:39.620" style="s2">litmus test of our physiological state</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.160" end="00:22:42.410" style="s2">can we go somewhere that we&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.620" end="00:22:45.020" style="s2">gone before are we secure enough to take</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.410" end="00:22:46.870" style="s2">ideas that may undermine the ideas that</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.020" end="00:22:49.910" style="s2">we spent decades of learning and</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.870" end="00:22:52.790" style="s2">publishing papers on so curiosity is a</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.910" end="00:22:53.870" style="s2">wonderful projective test I&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.790" end="00:22:57.470" style="s2">interested if you could just tie that</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.870" end="00:22:58.240" style="s2">curiosity to polyvagal theory well for</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.470" end="00:23:01.280" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.240" end="00:23:03.740" style="s2">curiosity cannot coexist when we&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.280" end="00:23:06.080" style="s2">physiological state of defense and what</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.740" end="00:23:08.840" style="s2">that means physiologically is that</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.080" end="00:23:10.670" style="s2">curiosity comes out of what I was</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.840" end="00:23:12.410" style="s2">calling the social engagement system</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.670" end="00:23:14.870" style="s2">which has this newer myelinated vagus</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.410" end="00:23:17.150" style="s2">when you&#39;re in the physiological state</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.870" end="00:23:19.130" style="s2">that supports the neural regulation the</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.150" end="00:23:22.240" style="s2">face and the voice in the veil control</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.130" end="00:23:26.050" style="s2">the heart it basically dampens or</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.240" end="00:23:28.179" style="s2">Taine&#39;s our reactivity so we can react</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.050" end="00:23:29.440" style="s2">but it&#39;s gonna be contained we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.179" end="00:23:31.000" style="s2">going to get violent we&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.440" end="00:23:34.780" style="s2">throw things at each other so you may</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.000" end="00:23:38.410" style="s2">challenge me I may feel a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.780" end="00:23:42.970" style="s2">uncomfortable but my social engagement</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.410" end="00:23:45.580" style="s2">system will make sure that my physiology</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.970" end="00:23:47.080" style="s2">will not go out of a certain range don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.580" end="00:23:49.960" style="s2">be able to maintain this social</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.080" end="00:23:53.980" style="s2">interaction and we&#39;ll build on our ideas</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.960" end="00:23:56.860" style="s2">so the the ability to listen and to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.980" end="00:23:59.410" style="s2">curious is really based on being able to</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.860" end="00:24:01.830" style="s2">regulate your physiology so that when</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.410" end="00:24:04.540" style="s2">you&#39;re challenged you don&#39;t go ballistic</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.830" end="00:24:06.429" style="s2">so I guess the 64 million dollar</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.540" end="00:24:09.370" style="s2">question is how do we control our</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.429" end="00:24:12.850" style="s2">physiology how do we have is it easy to</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.370" end="00:24:14.470" style="s2">sense when we&#39;re getting into one frame</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.850" end="00:24:16.929" style="s2">rather than the other and how do we how</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.470" end="00:24:18.730" style="s2">do we shift now I see I think it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.929" end="00:24:21.520" style="s2">really it&#39;s all what I think both of</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.730" end="00:24:23.679" style="s2">your questions are on some level they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.520" end="00:24:26.679" style="s2">very profound and important but not over</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.679" end="00:24:29.890" style="s2">the trivial because yes people know when</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.679" end="00:24:31.990" style="s2">they&#39;re losing it you know they and they</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.890" end="00:24:34.360" style="s2">projected to others their faces change</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.990" end="00:24:36.970" style="s2">they lose their effect and gets a flat</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.360" end="00:24:38.980" style="s2">face the voices change we need to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.970" end="00:24:41.470" style="s2">school to be able to understand this and</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.980" end="00:24:43.540" style="s2">detect this and to realize that we might</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.470" end="00:24:45.730" style="s2">have crossed into an area that triggers</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.540" end="00:24:47.500" style="s2">a response we need to not really</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.730" end="00:24:50.020" style="s2">understand the history of the person</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.500" end="00:24:51.670" style="s2">we&#39;re talking to but we need to respect</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.020" end="00:24:54.460" style="s2">that person so we may have a little</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.670" end="00:24:56.710" style="s2">compassion and a little bit of ability</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.460" end="00:24:59.740" style="s2">to witness but that should be part of</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.710" end="00:25:03.040" style="s2">our curriculum as being human beings so</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.740" end="00:25:05.140" style="s2">yes we can see this happening yes are</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.040" end="00:25:08.110" style="s2">when our body shift state our tolerance</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.140" end="00:25:10.750" style="s2">of sit still and to interact with other</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.110" end="00:25:13.420" style="s2">decreases now the real point that I</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.750" end="00:25:15.730" style="s2">think your ask is if that happens to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.420" end="00:25:17.710" style="s2">or happens to you what can I do I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.730" end="00:25:19.929" style="s2">losing my physiological statement in</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.710" end="00:25:22.270" style="s2">reality I don&#39;t want to get up I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.929" end="00:25:24.040" style="s2">want to fight I don&#39;t want to run I want</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.270" end="00:25:26.320" style="s2">to maintain the relationship especially</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.040" end="00:25:28.480" style="s2">if it&#39;s important for your career</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.320" end="00:25:30.940" style="s2">your life and the answer is there</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.480" end="00:25:32.920" style="s2">they&#39;re really relatively efficient ways</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.940" end="00:25:36.190" style="s2">of rapidly changing your physiological</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.920" end="00:25:39.340" style="s2">state bringing it back on board and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.190" end="00:25:42.300" style="s2">most powerful one or of easy most easy</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.340" end="00:25:44.920" style="s2">access to one is through breathing and</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.300" end="00:25:47.560" style="s2">breathing is powerful because if we</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.920" end="00:25:50.950" style="s2">extend the duration of our exhalations</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.560" end="00:25:53.290" style="s2">meaning exhale slowly the vagal effect</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.950" end="00:25:55.270" style="s2">on our sympathetic nervous system is</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.290" end="00:25:58.030" style="s2">powerful it basically down regulates our</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.270" end="00:26:00.820" style="s2">sympathetics so it starts to dampen our</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.030" end="00:26:02.680" style="s2">defenses so when people say take breathe</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.820" end="00:26:04.930" style="s2">slowly they didn&#39;t really mean that they</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.680" end="00:26:07.150" style="s2">meant they could be breath and exhale</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.930" end="00:26:10.210" style="s2">slowly because when you exhale slowly</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.150" end="00:26:12.310" style="s2">there&#39;s a neuro physiological effect</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.210" end="00:26:14.950" style="s2">that&#39;s occurring the vagal brake just</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.310" end="00:26:16.990" style="s2">like a break down the car is now going</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.950" end="00:26:19.300" style="s2">down on your sympathetic nervous system</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.990" end="00:26:22.120" style="s2">down regulating those defenses and</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.300" end="00:26:24.970" style="s2">calming you down so slow exhalations</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.120" end="00:26:28.120" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting is that you can even</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.970" end="00:26:30.400" style="s2">have a dialogue and use that so if</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.120" end="00:26:32.950" style="s2">people extend the duration of their</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.400" end="00:26:35.860" style="s2">phrases they&#39;re extending the duration</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.950" end="00:26:38.260" style="s2">of the exhalation and you can see this</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.860" end="00:26:40.870" style="s2">inserting dialogues when people take</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.260" end="00:26:42.670" style="s2">breaths after each word and you probably</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.870" end="00:26:43.960" style="s2">have seen people like that and what</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.670" end="00:26:46.840" style="s2">they&#39;re doing is shifting their</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.960" end="00:26:49.570" style="s2">physiological state to if they may</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.840" end="00:26:53.020" style="s2">support anxiety but it also can support</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.570" end="00:26:54.910" style="s2">aggression and the simplest things just</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.020" end="00:26:57.010" style="s2">extend the number words you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.910" end="00:26:58.560" style="s2">before you take a breath it seems when</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.010" end="00:27:00.310" style="s2">we look out there&#39;s a ever-growing</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.560" end="00:27:04.420" style="s2">polarization and there&#39;s an ever-growing</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.310" end="00:27:06.340" style="s2">kind of spiral of polarization what do</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.420" end="00:27:09.670" style="s2">you think when you see that and what</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.340" end="00:27:10.840" style="s2">what does your work have to illustrate</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.670" end="00:27:12.310" style="s2">or what do you think is the key thing to</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.840" end="00:27:14.410" style="s2">understand from your work to illustrate</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.310" end="00:27:17.110" style="s2">that well what&#39;s okay when you see the</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.410" end="00:27:19.540" style="s2">polarization and you see it every day is</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.110" end="00:27:22.840" style="s2">that the television not the first thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.540" end="00:27:25.450" style="s2">that comes to mind is why would people</p>

<p begin="00:27:25.450" end="00:27:30.660" style="s2">hurtful to others don&#39;t they have a</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.900" end="00:27:33.330" style="s2">degree of compassion</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.660" end="00:27:36.600" style="s2">don&#39;t they feel the pains of others and</p>

<p begin="00:27:36.600" end="00:27:41.700" style="s2">reason maybe they don&#39;t is maybe they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.370" end="00:27:43.890" style="s2">had traumatized series developmental</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.700" end="00:27:46.260" style="s2">histories as well and that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.890" end="00:27:49.200" style="s2">really reenacting the trauma that has</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.260" end="00:27:52.260" style="s2">happened to them I think this is really</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.200" end="00:27:54.840" style="s2">a real tragedy in life because many of</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.260" end="00:27:58.590" style="s2">the people who are this aggressive to</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.840" end="00:28:01.860" style="s2">others hateful to others their lives</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.590" end="00:28:04.140" style="s2">have been really not they have not been</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.860" end="00:28:05.250" style="s2">lives of co-regulation and love and</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.140" end="00:28:08.070" style="s2">caring of others</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.250" end="00:28:10.680" style="s2">they&#39;ve been lives of just trying to</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.070" end="00:28:13.470" style="s2">survive and often using the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.680" end="00:28:15.780" style="s2">metaphor the metaphor for survival is do</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.470" end="00:28:19.290" style="s2">I have more stuff do I have more money</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.780" end="00:28:22.110" style="s2">doing more land and that missed the real</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.290" end="00:28:24.480" style="s2">issue is do I feel comfort but comforted</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.110" end="00:28:28.050" style="s2">by being around other people do I like</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.480" end="00:28:31.140" style="s2">people do I like my kids do I feel</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.050" end="00:28:32.790" style="s2">excited about positive things not about</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.140" end="00:28:37.290" style="s2">just getting more money or more things</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.790" end="00:28:40.080" style="s2">so it&#39;s a real issue of for me when I</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.290" end="00:28:42.870" style="s2">see this I feel that with great</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.080" end="00:28:45.750" style="s2">compassion about but there are now</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.870" end="00:28:47.910" style="s2">basically people who are I don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.750" end="00:28:50.970" style="s2">like to use word perpetrators I see this</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.910" end="00:28:51.780" style="s2">and I look at that and I say this is so</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.970" end="00:28:54.750" style="s2">sad</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.780" end="00:28:55.890" style="s2">their lives are so sad but then I go to</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.750" end="00:28:58.470" style="s2">the other one which is much more</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.890" end="00:29:01.380" style="s2">pragmatic I can have the compassion for</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.470" end="00:29:04.710" style="s2">them but I can&#39;t justify the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.380" end="00:29:06.450" style="s2">people the number of people that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.710" end="00:29:08.880" style="s2">hurting the impact on the lives of</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.450" end="00:29:11.100" style="s2">others and that really bothers me a lot</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.880" end="00:29:13.590" style="s2">so you can say I can understand that I</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.100" end="00:29:16.290" style="s2">have compassion for you for you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.590" end="00:29:18.240" style="s2">or why you&#39;re doing it but I have a lot</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.290" end="00:29:21.450" style="s2">of trouble because you&#39;re hurting people</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.240" end="00:29:24.450" style="s2">and how can you hurt people and I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.450" end="00:29:26.850" style="s2">I hope more and more people will have an</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.450" end="00:29:29.280" style="s2">understanding of this I think the power</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.850" end="00:29:32.960" style="s2">of those who do that who marginalize who</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.280" end="00:29:35.179" style="s2">bully who who isolate people to whom</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.960" end="00:29:38.510" style="s2">leave them treat them poorly to gain</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.179" end="00:29:41.000" style="s2">power over them I just hope that more</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.510" end="00:29:43.190" style="s2">more people understand that literally</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.000" end="00:29:46.190" style="s2">the vulnerability of those people and</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.190" end="00:29:48.529" style="s2">why they&#39;re doing that and not so in</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.190" end="00:29:50.779" style="s2">politics we were talking a lot of this</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.529" end="00:29:53.570" style="s2">there&#39;s always this pragmatic I can live</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.779" end="00:29:54.980" style="s2">with that if I get what I want and I</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.570" end="00:29:57.529" style="s2">think people have to just get beyond</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.980" end="00:29:59.480" style="s2">that they have to say I&#39;ll never get</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.529" end="00:30:04.309" style="s2">enough of you there I&#39;ll never get what</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.480" end="00:30:06.289" style="s2">I need in a culture it&#39;s not ok with me</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.309" end="00:30:09.200" style="s2">if you&#39;re hurting people it&#39;s just not</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.289" end="00:30:12.140" style="s2">right so we have to have some different</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.200" end="00:30:14.390" style="s2">levels of what Michael absolutes so we</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.140" end="00:30:17.450" style="s2">started off our dialogue about the</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.390" end="00:30:20.330" style="s2">biological imperative to survive was to</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.450" end="00:30:22.130" style="s2">connect with others and polarization is</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.330" end="00:30:24.860" style="s2">a violation of that biological</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.130" end="00:30:27.620" style="s2">imperative and we have to literally draw</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.860" end="00:30:29.330" style="s2">a line in that line in the ground is if</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.620" end="00:30:32.809" style="s2">you start doing things that hurt people</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.330" end="00:30:35.600" style="s2">it by it violates the imperative of what</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.809" end="00:30:39.649" style="s2">we came what we evolve to be on this</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.600" end="00:30:42.980" style="s2">planet we are connected species and if</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.649" end="00:30:46.730" style="s2">we don&#39;t appreciate that we are in a</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.980" end="00:30:49.100" style="s2">sense injuring the species and we have</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.730" end="00:30:51.440" style="s2">to take on a responsibility the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.100" end="00:30:52.820" style="s2">line is I think there are gonna be more</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.440" end="00:30:55.460" style="s2">and more people having this</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.820" end="00:30:58.039" style="s2">understanding because now you have with</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.460" end="00:31:00.260" style="s2">polyvagal theory and neurobiology that</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.039" end="00:31:02.090" style="s2">supports the philosophy LOF achill and</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.260" end="00:31:04.520" style="s2">for many people even a spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.090" end="00:31:07.460" style="s2">religious view so you have a convergence</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.520" end="00:31:10.610" style="s2">of different orientations all ending up</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.460" end="00:31:12.080" style="s2">in the same point and this is polarizing</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.610" end="00:31:14.720" style="s2">people treating them as if they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.080" end="00:31:19.370" style="s2">human marginalizing them isolating and</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.720" end="00:31:22.039" style="s2">bullying them is not how humans need or</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.370" end="00:31:24.440" style="s2">have to our cessation it&#39;s not really</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.039" end="00:31:26.480" style="s2">need or should if they keep doing that</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.440" end="00:31:30.320" style="s2">they can&#39;t be humans it&#39;s almost like</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.480" end="00:31:32.110" style="s2">you violate what it is to be a human so</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.320" end="00:31:35.240" style="s2">do you say it as an existential threat</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.110" end="00:31:37.250" style="s2">no I know I don&#39;t see it as an</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.240" end="00:31:39.890" style="s2">existential threat because I see it as</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.250" end="00:31:42.049" style="s2">something that will dissipate because I</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.890" end="00:31:44.570" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s sustainable the main</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.049" end="00:31:45.680" style="s2">point of this of the argument that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.570" end="00:31:48.200" style="s2">a violation of</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.680" end="00:31:50.900" style="s2">of our biological imperative is that</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.200" end="00:31:55.330" style="s2">it&#39;s transitory and can&#39;t be sustained</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.900" end="00:31:58.720" style="s2">because being human is very powerful and</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.330" end="00:32:01.210" style="s2">this work comes originally from trauma</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.720" end="00:32:03.650" style="s2">understanding of trauma</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.210" end="00:32:05.630" style="s2">why does it apply more widely is it</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.650" end="00:32:07.820" style="s2">because we&#39;re all in a state of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.630" end="00:32:09.530" style="s2">low-level trauma or is it well what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.820" end="00:32:11.810" style="s2">interesting is my work didn&#39;t started</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.530" end="00:32:13.640" style="s2">try I&#39;m one of the few people in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.810" end="00:32:16.760" style="s2">trunk world of trauma the world of</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.640" end="00:32:19.040" style="s2">trauma therapy or trauma theory that</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.760" end="00:32:22.130" style="s2">didn&#39;t come from initially from trauma I</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.040" end="00:32:24.380" style="s2">came from my laboratory science and my</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.130" end="00:32:26.690" style="s2">laboratory science led me into a model</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.380" end="00:32:28.760" style="s2">and that model was polyvagal theory is a</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.690" end="00:32:30.950" style="s2">model of the evolution of the autonomic</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.760" end="00:32:33.650" style="s2">nervous system but it was also a model</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.950" end="00:32:35.930" style="s2">that showed that under challenges the</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.650" end="00:32:38.900" style="s2">autonomic nervous system shifted States</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.930" end="00:32:42.470" style="s2">to more primitive and primitive states</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.900" end="00:32:44.900" style="s2">of survival and so that is how it got</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.470" end="00:32:47.480" style="s2">picked up by the trauma world because</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.900" end="00:32:50.060" style="s2">people experienced severe trauma or</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.480" end="00:32:52.760" style="s2">locked in these more defensive states</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.060" end="00:32:55.070" style="s2">and then polyvagal theory started to</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.760" end="00:32:57.440" style="s2">provide insights now you can move people</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.070" end="00:32:59.800" style="s2">out of those states and it says</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.440" end="00:33:03.140" style="s2">rehabilitate them to a more typical</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.800" end="00:33:06.260" style="s2">neural regulation and with that more</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.140" end="00:33:08.780" style="s2">typical social and emotional behavior so</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.260" end="00:33:11.300" style="s2">because it was a general model of how</p>

<p begin="00:33:11.300" end="00:33:15.680" style="s2">works under challenge</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.710" end="00:33:17.420" style="s2">it has great generalizability so it has</p>

<p begin="00:33:17.420" end="00:33:23.060" style="s2">world of trauma but has a generalized</p>

<p begin="00:33:30.920" end="00:33:35.510" style="s2">really what we&#39;re talking about because</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.810" end="00:33:38.240" style="s2">it&#39;s providing a different type of</p>

<p begin="00:33:38.240" end="00:33:44.390" style="s2">so it&#39;s not a manual that&#39;s based upon</p>
