<p begin="00:00:02.700" end="00:00:15.660" style="s2">and I think the people should use it to</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.770" end="00:00:18.410" style="s2">vote for so in the last video I talked</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.660" end="00:00:21.140" style="s2">about how our complicated systems of</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.410" end="00:00:23.939" style="s2">organization and governance are</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.140" end="00:00:27.180" style="s2">fundamentally incapable of handling the</p>

<p begin="00:00:30.539" end="00:00:37.079" style="s2">causes harm in in this video I want to</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.460" end="00:00:38.850" style="s2">talk specifically about the political</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.079" end="00:00:41.610" style="s2">system and how the pollution that it</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.850" end="00:00:44.010" style="s2">generates and dumps into the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.610" end="00:00:47.280" style="s2">economic physical and intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.010" end="00:00:49.500" style="s2">environments has led to the situation</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.280" end="00:00:52.590" style="s2">where the spirit of the political system</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.500" end="00:00:54.180" style="s2">ie a forum in which we can discuss and</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.590" end="00:00:56.670" style="s2">decide what we&#39;re going to do together</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.180" end="00:00:58.170" style="s2">as a society has been completely lost</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.670" end="00:00:59.960" style="s2">and it&#39;s become completely corrupt and</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.170" end="00:01:01.949" style="s2">is no longer even remotely</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.960" end="00:01:04.400" style="s2">representative of the will or the</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.949" end="00:01:06.240" style="s2">interests of the people and so we have</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.400" end="00:01:07.530" style="s2">absolutely nothing to lose and</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.240" end="00:01:10.530" style="s2">potentially everything to gain by</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.530" end="00:01:12.750" style="s2">rejecting it in its entirety through a</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.530" end="00:01:14.310" style="s2">none of the above vote there&#39;s a rich</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.750" end="00:01:15.600" style="s2">treasure trove of up to</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.310" end="00:01:17.250" style="s2">enjoy here and we need to look no</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.600" end="00:01:22.920" style="s2">further than the last US presidential</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.250" end="00:01:25.860" style="s2">election so out of 231 million eligible</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.920" end="00:01:27.750" style="s2">voters 63 million of them voted for</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.860" end="00:01:29.430" style="s2">Trump which represents twenty seven</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.750" end="00:01:32.579" style="s2">point three percent of the eligible</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.430" end="00:01:35.159" style="s2">voters and so Trump was elected barely a</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.579" end="00:01:37.860" style="s2">quarter of the population put him into</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.159" end="00:01:40.140" style="s2">power that election costs over a billion</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.860" end="00:01:41.420" style="s2">dollars in campaign contributions that</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.140" end="00:01:44.340" style="s2">were spent was over a billion dollars</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.420" end="00:01:46.409" style="s2">and where did that billion dollars come</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.340" end="00:01:48.110" style="s2">from and how was it spend and so you</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.409" end="00:01:50.700" style="s2">know it was spent primarily on</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.110" end="00:01:52.200" style="s2">mudslinging at the opposition and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.700" end="00:01:53.939" style="s2">again this is one of the forms of</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.200" end="00:01:55.950" style="s2">pollution right and so in the culture</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.939" end="00:01:57.960" style="s2">now you have these two camps you</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.950" end="00:02:00.119" style="s2">absolutely cannot talk to each other if</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.960" end="00:02:03.420" style="s2">you&#39;re a Democrat you think that Trump</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.119" end="00:02:05.700" style="s2">supporters are a bunch of racist redneck</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.420" end="00:02:07.740" style="s2">morons and if you&#39;re a trump supporter</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.700" end="00:02:10.709" style="s2">you think that Democrats are a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.740" end="00:02:12.629" style="s2">soft wet lefty pinko liberal baby</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.709" end="00:02:14.200" style="s2">killers you know and and there is no</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.629" end="00:02:15.640" style="s2">possible way that the</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.200" end="00:02:18.400" style="s2">you can have a conversation with each</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.640" end="00:02:20.530" style="s2">other as to where the billion dollars</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.400" end="00:02:21.940" style="s2">came from in the u.s. it&#39;s not as bad in</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.530" end="00:02:23.590" style="s2">the UK but the u.s. is essentially</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.940" end="00:02:25.750" style="s2">legitimized corruption in its politicans</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.590" end="00:02:27.010" style="s2">political system there are two court</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.750" end="00:02:29.500" style="s2">decisions over the last few decades</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.010" end="00:02:32.590" style="s2">Buckley versus Valeo and Citizens United</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.500" end="00:02:35.440" style="s2">which respectively defined corporations</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.590" end="00:02:36.910" style="s2">as people and money as speech and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.440" end="00:02:38.709" style="s2">corporations can now spend as much money</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.910" end="00:02:40.780" style="s2">as they want on political campaigning</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.709" end="00:02:43.000" style="s2">also in that election Hillary actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.780" end="00:02:45.040" style="s2">polled more of the votes than Trump did</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.000" end="00:02:46.810" style="s2">she got 66 million proximately Tom got</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.040" end="00:02:48.970" style="s2">63 million so well despite the fact she</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.810" end="00:02:50.890" style="s2">got three million more votes she loses</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.970" end="00:02:52.660" style="s2">the election but you know she&#39;s no saint</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.890" end="00:02:54.610" style="s2">either because in the Democratic</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.660" end="00:02:56.349" style="s2">primaries Bernie should have been the</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.610" end="00:02:57.880" style="s2">candidate I mean he polled far more of</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.349" end="00:02:59.799" style="s2">the districts than she did and yet state</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.880" end="00:03:01.329" style="s2">after state after state because of</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.799" end="00:03:04.030" style="s2">manipulation of the super delegate</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.329" end="00:03:07.650" style="s2">system came back in favor of Hillary so</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.030" end="00:03:10.269" style="s2">the whole thing was a joke in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.650" end="00:03:12.670" style="s2">representation of the people and you</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.269" end="00:03:14.860" style="s2">know like a clean fair election the</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.670" end="00:03:16.989" style="s2">whole thing was a joke but even deeper</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.860" end="00:03:18.280" style="s2">than that the whole concepts of voting</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.989" end="00:03:19.389" style="s2">our continent where I heard this but</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.280" end="00:03:20.620" style="s2">it&#39;s a really interesting idea and a</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.389" end="00:03:22.950" style="s2">really important one that if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.620" end="00:03:25.090" style="s2">forced to vote that means that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.950" end="00:03:27.100" style="s2">attempt of the society to reach</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.090" end="00:03:29.410" style="s2">agreement to reach consensus has failed</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.100" end="00:03:32.560" style="s2">and so you are forced then to vote and</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.410" end="00:03:34.930" style="s2">this creates camps divisions within the</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.560" end="00:03:37.630" style="s2">society and this is one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.930" end="00:03:39.010" style="s2">insidious and pervasive forms of</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.630" end="00:03:41.170" style="s2">pollution that our political system has</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.010" end="00:03:44.319" style="s2">created for us we have a very similar</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.170" end="00:03:45.940" style="s2">situation in the UK where 60 65 percent</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.319" end="00:03:48.310" style="s2">something like that turnouts in</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.940" end="00:03:51.190" style="s2">elections and polling forty percent also</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.310" end="00:03:52.720" style="s2">of that 60 65 percent is sufficient to</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.190" end="00:03:54.670" style="s2">get you a majority in parliament and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.720" end="00:03:57.819" style="s2">once again 25 to 30 percent of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.670" end="00:03:59.170" style="s2">electorate is putting a party into power</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.819" end="00:04:00.940" style="s2">and once they are in power then that</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.170" end="00:04:01.420" style="s2">very small group of people gets to make</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.940" end="00:04:04.900" style="s2">the decision</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.420" end="00:04:06.579" style="s2">everybody must follow and remember 25 30</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.900" end="00:04:09.370" style="s2">percent of the people actually put them</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.579" end="00:04:12.099" style="s2">there so you know it is fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.370" end="00:04:13.989" style="s2">inequitable the way we do that and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.099" end="00:04:16.660" style="s2">when it comes to election time how are</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.989" end="00:04:18.820" style="s2">our votes canvassed you know that in</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.660" end="00:04:20.349" style="s2">order for a party to attract people</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.820" end="00:04:22.390" style="s2">towards it it needs to have a distinct</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.349" end="00:04:24.370" style="s2">identity from the other parties and</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.390" end="00:04:26.450" style="s2">generate loyalty in that way and so it</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.370" end="00:04:29.150" style="s2">inevitably creates</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.450" end="00:04:31.700" style="s2">the cereal camps rival Rus adversarial</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.150" end="00:04:33.680" style="s2">camps and therefore reaching broad</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.700" end="00:04:35.210" style="s2">agreement in the society is virtually</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.680" end="00:04:36.380" style="s2">impossible because for any policy that</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.210" end="00:04:38.270" style="s2">the government comes up with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.380" end="00:04:41.600" style="s2">opposition&#39;s job is to oppose that</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.270" end="00:04:44.360" style="s2">policy and so you have a win-lose</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.600" end="00:04:46.010" style="s2">situation constantly created rather than</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.360" end="00:04:47.810" style="s2">a compromised situation building a</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.010" end="00:04:49.640" style="s2">consensus reach and compromise you have</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.810" end="00:04:51.770" style="s2">a win-lose situation where this is our</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.640" end="00:04:53.390" style="s2">idea we&#39;re against that idea let&#39;s have</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.770" end="00:04:55.460" style="s2">a vote one camp wins the other camp</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.390" end="00:04:58.580" style="s2">loses and so this creates a general</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.460" end="00:05:00.500" style="s2">mindset a general modality of enemy and</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.580" end="00:05:01.850" style="s2">of them and us seeking out an enemy and</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.500" end="00:05:04.040" style="s2">every problem that we have in our</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.850" end="00:05:05.930" style="s2">society you know climate change we found</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.040" end="00:05:07.010" style="s2">an enemy carbon dioxide is the enemy and</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.930" end="00:05:09.410" style="s2">we&#39;re going to bring everything to a</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.010" end="00:05:14.000" style="s2">bear to attack that enemy and this</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.410" end="00:05:16.000" style="s2">mindset of them and us other finding an</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.000" end="00:05:19.610" style="s2">enemy and seeking to attack it is</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.000" end="00:05:20.840" style="s2">another one of the insidious nasty forms</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.610" end="00:05:23.120" style="s2">of pollution that our political system</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.840" end="00:05:24.650" style="s2">generates and then you have to consider</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.120" end="00:05:26.630" style="s2">who are these people that stand for</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.650" end="00:05:28.040" style="s2">Parliament or that run for Congress or</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.630" end="00:05:29.450" style="s2">Senate or whatever where do they come</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.040" end="00:05:30.500" style="s2">from how are they selected them and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.450" end="00:05:31.910" style="s2">don&#39;t know a huge amount about the</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.500" end="00:05:32.990" style="s2">process in the u.s. I actually believe</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.910" end="00:05:34.940" style="s2">it&#39;s a bit more democratic than where</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.990" end="00:05:37.460" style="s2">anybody can stand if they get sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.940" end="00:05:39.950" style="s2">numbers of signatures to register but in</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.460" end="00:05:41.360" style="s2">the UK you have really no chance of</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.950" end="00:05:42.890" style="s2">winning a seat in parliament unless you</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.360" end="00:05:45.650" style="s2">are standing for one of the parties and</p>

<p begin="00:07:26.280" end="00:07:29.310" style="s2">point I want to make here is something</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.330" end="00:07:30.630" style="s2">that Russell Brand pointed to I think he</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.310" end="00:07:32.280" style="s2">makes a really really good point to</p>

<p begin="00:07:33.630" end="00:07:37.970" style="s2">felt kind of sorry for her if I&#39;m honest</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.640" end="00:07:40.770" style="s2">you know I think she&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.970" end="00:07:43.350" style="s2">intentioned person I really do and</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.770" end="00:07:44.880" style="s2">wanted to do good but found herself in a</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.350" end="00:07:46.590" style="s2">situation partly because it breaks it</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.880" end="00:07:48.210" style="s2">but even without bricks it found herself</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.590" end="00:07:49.830" style="s2">in a situation and inheriting an</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.210" end="00:07:52.110" style="s2">apparatus that made it impossible for</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.830" end="00:07:54.690" style="s2">her to do that which she wanted to do</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.110" end="00:07:56.850" style="s2">when she first came to power when she</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.690" end="00:07:58.560" style="s2">took over from David Cameron the speech</p>

<p begin="00:08:04.620" end="00:08:07.800" style="s2">sympathetic to their plight and it will</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.150" end="00:08:10.410" style="s2">be the first priority of my government</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.800" end="00:08:13.380" style="s2">to make sure that we make life a little</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.410" end="00:08:14.610" style="s2">bit easier for those people and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.380" end="00:08:17.220" style="s2">whatever it was two years later</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.610" end="00:08:20.250" style="s2">something like that she left her post in</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.220" end="00:08:24.930" style="s2">tears saying that it was basically felt</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.250" end="00:08:27.000" style="s2">she was unable to be of proper service</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.930" end="00:08:28.500" style="s2">to the country that she loved and you</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.000" end="00:08:29.610" style="s2">know in both of those cases I certainly</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.500" end="00:08:31.590" style="s2">got the impression and Russell Brand</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.610" end="00:08:33.300" style="s2">made the same point that she was you</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.590" end="00:08:35.010" style="s2">know sincere she was a human being she</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.300" end="00:08:36.990" style="s2">was a real Mensch in both of those</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.010" end="00:08:39.690" style="s2">situations but in the intervening couple</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.990" end="00:08:41.969" style="s2">of years she was like a robot she was an</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.690" end="00:08:44.310" style="s2">automaton I mean I don&#39;t think any of us</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.969" end="00:08:45.750" style="s2">will forget that time she was asked you</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.310" end="00:08:47.490" style="s2">know what was something you did when you</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.750" end="00:08:48.839" style="s2">were a child that was naughty and she</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.490" end="00:08:50.400" style="s2">came up this ridiculous thing of running</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.839" end="00:08:51.660" style="s2">through the farmer&#39;s wheat fields it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.400" end="00:08:57.170" style="s2">the naughtiest thing you ever do</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.660" end="00:09:00.360" style="s2">it oh goodness me and well I suppose the</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.170" end="00:09:02.100" style="s2">gosh do you know I&#39;m not quite sure and</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.360" end="00:09:04.980" style="s2">my slope in a moment nobody is nobody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.100" end="00:09:07.050" style="s2">ever perfectly okay are they I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.980" end="00:09:08.550" style="s2">know I have to confess when me and my</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.050" end="00:09:10.949" style="s2">friends sort of used to run through the</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.550" end="00:09:11.670" style="s2">fields of wheat the farmers weren&#39;t too</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.949" end="00:09:14.939" style="s2">pleased about that</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.670" end="00:09:16.170" style="s2">and you could see while she was coming</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.939" end="00:09:17.430" style="s2">up to the answer while she was coming up</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.170" end="00:09:19.470" style="s2">with that art so you could see the</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.430" end="00:09:21.569" style="s2">wheels turning in her head you know what</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.470" end="00:09:23.970" style="s2">can I say Who am I going to upset what</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.569" end="00:09:27.029" style="s2">vested interests am I gonna get on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.970" end="00:09:29.819" style="s2">wrong side of if I say whatever and and</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.029" end="00:09:31.649" style="s2">so our system demands of its</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.819" end="00:09:32.939" style="s2">representatives our political system</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.649" end="00:09:34.860" style="s2">demands of its representatives if they</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.939" end="00:09:38.240" style="s2">give up their humanity when they assume</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.860" end="00:09:38.240" style="s2">office yeah that they become this</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.509" end="00:09:44.009" style="s2">functioning automaton kind of thing we</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.430" end="00:09:46.050" style="s2">can&#39;t actually just say what they think</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.009" end="00:09:48.149" style="s2">it is impossible for senior politicians</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.050" end="00:09:49.379" style="s2">to go on TV with all of their party</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.149" end="00:09:50.939" style="s2">affiliations and all of their corporate</p>

<p begin="00:09:54.329" end="00:09:57.600" style="s2">say what they think because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.829" end="00:10:00.180" style="s2">gonna piss people off who are</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.600" end="00:10:01.769" style="s2">influential and even with the best will</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.180" end="00:10:03.779" style="s2">in the world politicians can&#39;t just make</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.769" end="00:10:05.730" style="s2">decisions in the best interest of their</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.779" end="00:10:08.759" style="s2">people they&#39;re at the mercy of huge</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.730" end="00:10:11.130" style="s2">moneyed interests you know if if a big</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.759" end="00:10:12.300" style="s2">car company says you know give us a tax</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.130" end="00:10:13.470" style="s2">break or we&#39;re not going to build a</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.300" end="00:10:14.639" style="s2">factory in your country and you won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.470" end="00:10:16.649" style="s2">get the jobs and you won&#39;t get the tax</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.639" end="00:10:18.800" style="s2">revenue then you know concessions will</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.649" end="00:10:23.100" style="s2">be made and so you know they&#39;re not even</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.800" end="00:10:24.360" style="s2">real agents of choice in the countries</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.100" end="00:10:27.209" style="s2">that they are supposed to be governing</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.360" end="00:10:29.430" style="s2">and while our system runs on these kinds</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.209" end="00:10:31.800" style="s2">of things it has absolutely no hope of</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.430" end="00:10:33.899" style="s2">coming up with anything sensible I mean</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.800" end="00:10:35.339" style="s2">you need only look at the three years or</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.899" end="00:10:37.110" style="s2">whatever that the UK government has been</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.339" end="00:10:38.819" style="s2">an absolute paralysis because David</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.110" end="00:10:40.970" style="s2">Cameron abdicated his responsibilities</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.819" end="00:10:43.259" style="s2">in disciplining his own backbenchers</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.970" end="00:10:45.839" style="s2">left the door open to a brexit vote</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.259" end="00:10:48.329" style="s2">there was no plan whatsoever I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.839" end="00:10:50.100" style="s2">unbelievable crass irresponsibility of</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.329" end="00:10:51.990" style="s2">having no plan in place should the</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.100" end="00:10:54.720" style="s2">electorate come back with a brexit vote</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.990" end="00:10:56.129" style="s2">so you know that I could go on and on</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.720" end="00:10:57.569" style="s2">and on and on but I don&#39;t I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.129" end="00:10:58.860" style="s2">to make these videos too long the idea</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.569" end="00:11:01.829" style="s2">is to keep these sort of fairly short</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.860" end="00:11:04.120" style="s2">and punchy and so the overall point I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.829" end="00:11:06.550" style="s2">trying to make here is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.120" end="00:11:08.260" style="s2">system is fundamentally broken it is no</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.550" end="00:11:10.290" style="s2">longer even if it ever was it is no</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.260" end="00:11:12.850" style="s2">longer fit for purpose it no longer even</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.290" end="00:11:16.029" style="s2">pretends to have the best interests of</p>
