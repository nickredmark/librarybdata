<p begin="00:32:56.000" end="00:32:59.360" style="s2">to meditate right after running because</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.760" end="00:33:00.559" style="s2">you&#39;ve got your oxygenated you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.360" end="00:33:03.440" style="s2">probably got</p>

<p begin="00:33:11.919" end="00:33:16.559" style="s2">feeling your heart pounding</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.279" end="00:33:19.600" style="s2">or you&#39;ve you&#39;ve done a proper warm down</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.559" end="00:33:22.159" style="s2">uh mark lefebvre hi mark mark is uh and</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.600" end="00:33:23.200" style="s2">you know his participation in the sangha</p>

<p begin="00:33:25.519" end="00:33:31.600" style="s2">commitment to it is much appreciated</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.760" end="00:33:33.120" style="s2">um i&#39;m getting just better elucidation</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.600" end="00:33:36.159" style="s2">on the difference between flow</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.120" end="00:33:39.840" style="s2">and focus so</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.159" end="00:33:43.120" style="s2">the they are deeply interpenetrating um</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.840" end="00:33:46.480" style="s2">and um flow is very much about</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.120" end="00:33:47.600" style="s2">opening up that field of introspective</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.480" end="00:33:51.120" style="s2">awareness</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.600" end="00:33:54.399" style="s2">uh where its focus is</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.120" end="00:33:56.960" style="s2">right the degree to which you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.399" end="00:33:58.799" style="s2">following the focal uh area of your</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.960" end="00:34:00.480" style="s2">breath remember field and focus</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.799" end="00:34:03.279" style="s2">and what&#39;s being maintained there is</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.480" end="00:34:06.399" style="s2">more about the continuity</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.279" end="00:34:08.159" style="s2">so flow is more about sort of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.399" end="00:34:09.839" style="s2">fill the whole of the body with the</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.159" end="00:34:12.720" style="s2">whole of the mind</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.839" end="00:34:14.159" style="s2">and then uh focus is more about trying</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.720" end="00:34:16.639" style="s2">to get a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.159" end="00:34:17.520" style="s2">momentum to this but but as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.639" end="00:34:19.359" style="s2">rightly noting</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.520" end="00:34:21.200" style="s2">that has an aspect of flow to it because</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.359" end="00:34:23.679" style="s2">when you get into flow</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.200" end="00:34:25.040" style="s2">it helps you be more absorbed it makes</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.679" end="00:34:26.560" style="s2">it more self-organizing which is</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.040" end="00:34:29.520" style="s2">precisely why i teach you</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.560" end="00:34:31.040" style="s2">flow but before i teach you a focus um</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.520" end="00:34:32.720" style="s2">they you should find that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.040" end="00:34:35.599" style="s2">continuum between them</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.720" end="00:34:36.079" style="s2">they&#39;re not totally identical uh where</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.599" end="00:34:38.720" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.079" end="00:34:41.359" style="s2">i would say that uh flow is more sort of</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.720" end="00:34:43.440" style="s2">about the embodiment</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.359" end="00:34:45.200" style="s2">of what you do of the breath and then</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.440" end="00:34:46.480" style="s2">focus is more about the enactment how</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.200" end="00:34:48.399" style="s2">one moment</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.480" end="00:34:49.679" style="s2">of mindfulness is leading to the next</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.399" end="00:34:52.960" style="s2">but there is it can</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.679" end="00:34:55.440" style="s2">definitely a continuum between them</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.960" end="00:34:57.119" style="s2">matthew mccready i sometimes find myself</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.440" end="00:34:58.160" style="s2">rooting centering or finding my flow in</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.119" end="00:35:00.079" style="s2">my normal life</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.160" end="00:35:01.440" style="s2">is this like meditating before sleep and</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.079" end="00:35:04.400" style="s2">should it only be done when i&#39;m sitting</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.440" end="00:35:05.520" style="s2">no it&#39;s not like meditating before do</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.400" end="00:35:07.760" style="s2">more of that matthew</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.520" end="00:35:08.560" style="s2">encourage that that&#39;s that&#39;s celebrating</p>

<p begin="00:35:08.560" end="00:35:12.480" style="s2">if you find yourself centering rooting</p>

<p begin="00:35:37.280" end="00:35:41.520" style="s2">reciprocal opening towards oneself is</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.200" end="00:35:43.680" style="s2">precisely not to have oneself</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.520" end="00:35:44.560" style="s2">um and it&#39;s not about what you want for</p>

<p begin="00:37:18.400" end="00:37:23.280" style="s2">um so that&#39;s a good question and what</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.760" end="00:37:26.160" style="s2">typically happens</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.280" end="00:37:27.920" style="s2">when we&#39;re aspiring which means to go</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.160" end="00:37:30.160" style="s2">through transformation and become</p>

<p begin="00:37:33.520" end="00:37:35.280" style="s2">is when you want to go from being</p>

<p begin="00:37:35.280" end="00:37:41.680" style="s2">to wise or cowardly to courageous</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.640" end="00:37:43.040" style="s2">right these are aspirational your</p>

<p begin="00:39:03.440" end="00:39:07.200" style="s2">and this is why i often say to people</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.920" end="00:39:09.440" style="s2">don&#39;t tell me what you believe</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.200" end="00:39:11.119" style="s2">tell me what you practice because it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:39:12.400" end="00:39:16.160" style="s2">and only in the transformation will we</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.400" end="00:39:18.160" style="s2">become conformed</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.160" end="00:39:19.440" style="s2">and thereby informed about what</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.160" end="00:39:22.480" style="s2">transcends us because</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.440" end="00:39:24.720" style="s2">if we&#39;re trying to grow we have to come</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.480" end="00:39:28.720" style="s2">into relation to what transcends us</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.720" end="00:39:32.000" style="s2">as we are now there is no</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.720" end="00:39:34.320" style="s2">other way and so if you&#39;re constantly</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.000" end="00:39:35.680" style="s2">assimilating just constantly taking it</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.320" end="00:39:38.720" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.680" end="00:39:39.680" style="s2">right gathering and you&#39;re actually not</p>

<p begin="00:39:39.680" end="00:39:45.599" style="s2">you&#39;re not actually practicing coming</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.400" end="00:39:49.280" style="s2">into a process of transformation</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.599" end="00:39:50.480" style="s2">and so very often this kind of modal</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.280" end="00:39:53.599" style="s2">confusion</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.480" end="00:39:56.160" style="s2">um it has to do with the fact</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.599" end="00:39:56.720" style="s2">that we are attracted if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.160" end="00:39:58.640" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.720" end="00:40:00.400" style="s2">calling us we feel called to the</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.640" end="00:40:02.880" style="s2">transformation but there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.400" end="00:40:04.640" style="s2">underlying anxiety about actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.880" end="00:40:06.640" style="s2">pursuing the transformation</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.640" end="00:40:08.160" style="s2">so we substitute it&#39;s in cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.640" end="00:40:09.200" style="s2">science it&#39;s called satisficing we</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.160" end="00:40:11.920" style="s2">satisfies</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.200" end="00:40:13.280" style="s2">with being but listening to about</p>

<p begin="00:40:13.280" end="00:40:20.640" style="s2">gathering you know gems of phrases and</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.839" end="00:40:22.240" style="s2">terms and again i&#39;m not accused we are</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.640" end="00:40:25.599" style="s2">all prone to this</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.240" end="00:40:29.200" style="s2">okay and so we have to thereby</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.599" end="00:40:31.280" style="s2">note that we have to turn</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.200" end="00:40:32.319" style="s2">and ask ourselves maybe doing meta</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.280" end="00:40:34.800" style="s2">towards ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.319" end="00:40:36.800" style="s2">doing inquiring mindfulness why am i not</p>
