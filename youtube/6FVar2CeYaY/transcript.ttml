<p begin="00:00:03.330" end="00:00:08.250" style="s2">broadcast to me anyway they&#39;re on like</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.819" end="00:00:09.570" style="s2">episode 1718 which I&#39;m gonna catch up</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.250" end="00:00:11.719" style="s2">with in the next two weeks because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.570" end="00:00:15.120" style="s2">going to listen to an episode a day and</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.719" end="00:00:17.779" style="s2">critique it&#39;s the wrong word just offer</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.120" end="00:00:21.300" style="s2">my opinion on what it sparked in me or</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.779" end="00:00:23.250" style="s2">my what I see what they&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.300" end="00:00:26.400" style="s2">related to the global cooperative that I</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.250" end="00:00:28.769" style="s2">have in visions and so the guy who does</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.400" end="00:00:32.579" style="s2">it is named Michael Elbert and it is</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.769" end="00:00:35.550" style="s2">revolutions II and this episode one is</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.579" end="00:00:38.280" style="s2">called why vision why strategy and so a</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.550" end="00:00:40.350" style="s2">lot of what he talks about is that we</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.280" end="00:00:44.219" style="s2">need a vision and strategy something we</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.350" end="00:00:48.090" style="s2">can work together towards instead of and</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.219" end="00:00:52.890" style="s2">what I thought what it sparked was we</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.090" end="00:00:55.289" style="s2">have the same things we desire but we</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.890" end="00:00:56.879" style="s2">have different things we fear and so we</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.289" end="00:00:58.680" style="s2">critique and argue about what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.879" end="00:01:01.590" style="s2">scared about we&#39;re more scared about our</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.680" end="00:01:06.060" style="s2">family we&#39;re more scared about our own</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.590" end="00:01:07.950" style="s2">individual health or and those things</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.060" end="00:01:10.020" style="s2">play off each other right we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.950" end="00:01:12.240" style="s2">what&#39;s the biggest priority isn&#39;t racism</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.020" end="00:01:17.630" style="s2">is it homophobia is it is it my kids</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.240" end="00:01:20.820" style="s2">being fed versus what we desire is often</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.630" end="00:01:22.409" style="s2">not unique to us right we do desire kids</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.820" end="00:01:25.350" style="s2">to be fed we desire to be healthy we</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.409" end="00:01:28.439" style="s2">desire to be have abundance in our own</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.350" end="00:01:31.970" style="s2">lives and so that was was interesting</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.439" end="00:01:35.540" style="s2">and it like what I know I struggle with</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.970" end="00:01:39.150" style="s2">presenting what it is I envision in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.540" end="00:01:42.600" style="s2">positive what we get what we get vision</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.150" end="00:01:44.159" style="s2">as opposed to why we need it because</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.600" end="00:01:48.240" style="s2">we&#39;re about to have a terrifying future</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.159" end="00:01:51.360" style="s2">and I live in both of those worlds I</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.240" end="00:01:53.490" style="s2">live in the okay this is going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.360" end="00:01:55.610" style="s2">shitstorm in my kids lifetime if we</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.490" end="00:01:58.890" style="s2">don&#39;t do something about it and also</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.610" end="00:01:59.399" style="s2">with what I&#39;m able to see as possible in</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.890" end="00:02:03.719" style="s2">the future</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.399" end="00:02:06.299" style="s2">a future I am actively working towards I</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.719" end="00:02:08.010" style="s2">do have vision and I have strategy I</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.299" end="00:02:10.230" style="s2">just really wish I could</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.010" end="00:02:12.900" style="s2">educate it in a way that it works and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.230" end="00:02:14.220" style="s2">know that part of what we need to do and</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.900" end="00:02:16.440" style="s2">what I&#39;ve struggled with because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.220" end="00:02:19.320" style="s2">well doing the work I&#39;m doing I&#39;ve come</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.440" end="00:02:21.990" style="s2">across many movements that are amazing</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.320" end="00:02:24.330" style="s2">and had conversations with people like</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.990" end="00:02:28.230" style="s2">Nicole from the trance the transition I</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.330" end="00:02:31.080" style="s2">think that I&#39;m part of but there is this</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.230" end="00:02:33.090" style="s2">weird like we don&#39;t join together and</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.080" end="00:02:34.740" style="s2">part of it is somebody creates their own</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.090" end="00:02:37.050" style="s2">visioning values and then you&#39;re either</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.740" end="00:02:41.070" style="s2">going to come on board and work from</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.050" end="00:02:42.840" style="s2">that point or you&#39;re not and I long</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.070" end="00:02:47.750" style="s2">before searching other people to work on</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.840" end="00:02:49.710" style="s2">to join the project I want to create new</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.750" end="00:02:51.830" style="s2">ok well what are the things that would</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.710" end="00:02:54.150" style="s2">need to be in place if I found an</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.830" end="00:02:56.490" style="s2">organization or a group that held these</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.150" end="00:03:00.690" style="s2">values I would jump on board and help</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.490" end="00:03:02.670" style="s2">them to the best of my ability and for</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.690" end="00:03:04.410" style="s2">me it&#39;s things like democracy or</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.670" end="00:03:06.150" style="s2">something equivalent that people get a</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.410" end="00:03:08.610" style="s2">voice that it&#39;s transparent that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.150" end="00:03:09.990" style="s2">not well we created this and now you can</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.610" end="00:03:12.050" style="s2">either be part of the inner circle or</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.990" end="00:03:14.340" style="s2">not part of the inner circle I want</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.050" end="00:03:18.510" style="s2">anyone who comes on board to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.340" end="00:03:21.620" style="s2">be as instrumental as they desire I want</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.510" end="00:03:24.930" style="s2">it to be voluntary I want it to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.620" end="00:03:29.160" style="s2">something that inspires me to be my best</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.930" end="00:03:31.080" style="s2">self to I need it to not be able as&#39; and</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.160" end="00:03:32.940" style="s2">a lot of them are really able is and</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.080" end="00:03:34.530" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna get to the later podcast</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.940" end="00:03:36.870" style="s2">later which I&#39;m sure I will have</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.530" end="00:03:39.750" style="s2">comments on and everyone&#39;s ablest I mean</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.870" end="00:03:41.550" style="s2">unless you have every single disability</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.750" end="00:03:42.870" style="s2">that is possible on this planet you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.550" end="00:03:45.150" style="s2">going to have some internal ableism</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.870" end="00:03:47.250" style="s2">about your stuff and other other peoples</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.150" end="00:03:48.450" style="s2">that having more intelligence makes you</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.250" end="00:03:50.550" style="s2">more worthy and whatever that</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.450" end="00:03:52.020" style="s2">intelligence is then having more</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.550" end="00:03:55.380" style="s2">physical ability makes you more worthy</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.020" end="00:03:58.110" style="s2">and I don&#39;t think anything makes you</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.380" end="00:04:00.870" style="s2">want worthy I think each of us is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.110" end="00:04:02.340" style="s2">unique entity that is worthy of being on</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.870" end="00:04:03.989" style="s2">this planet having our needs met and</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.340" end="00:04:05.880" style="s2">getting to contribute in our own unique</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.989" end="00:04:08.640" style="s2">way and it&#39;s about organizing that</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.880" end="00:04:10.800" style="s2">effort in a way that collectively moves</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.640" end="00:04:13.350" style="s2">us forward so for the individual it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.800" end="00:04:15.480" style="s2">easy and fun and for the group there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.350" end="00:04:16.980" style="s2">powerful momentum forward and I can see</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.480" end="00:04:18.350" style="s2">how we get there with a technology</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.980" end="00:04:20.360" style="s2">cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.350" end="00:04:23.360" style="s2">that we all own together and anyone can</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.360" end="00:04:26.540" style="s2">come on board and be a part of and I see</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.360" end="00:04:28.900" style="s2">like the first communication platform</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.540" end="00:04:30.920" style="s2">that facilitates that facilitates</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.900" end="00:04:32.180" style="s2">although the communication platform</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.920" end="00:04:33.530" style="s2">might not be able to be done in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.180" end="00:04:36.050" style="s2">transparent open way because we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.530" end="00:04:38.420" style="s2">yet have the tools once we have the</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.050" end="00:04:42.080" style="s2">social media platform that we own that</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.420" end="00:04:43.130" style="s2">we can help Co evolve as we can say</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.080" end="00:04:44.690" style="s2">what&#39;s not working on what is working</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.130" end="00:04:47.180" style="s2">it&#39;s designed for a meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.690" end="00:04:49.220" style="s2">conversation then all of the meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.180" end="00:04:51.830" style="s2">conversations can take place and we can</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.220" end="00:04:53.690" style="s2">tackle all of the problems by passing</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.830" end="00:04:55.580" style="s2">the current government and for-profit</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.690" end="00:04:57.560" style="s2">corporations and just creating solutions</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.580" end="00:04:59.300" style="s2">together once we have the tools to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.560" end="00:05:00.590" style="s2">able to do that which starts with just a</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.300" end="00:05:02.840" style="s2">conversation so I don&#39;t know how much</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.590" end="00:05:05.360" style="s2">I&#39;ve talked about that episode but I am</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.840" end="00:05:08.960" style="s2">excited to have found this podcast I</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.360" end="00:05:11.330" style="s2">said it was revolutions II episode 1 why</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.960" end="00:05:13.580" style="s2">vision why strategy and the person who</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.330" end="00:05:18.170" style="s2">does it is Michael Albert if I can bring</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.580" end="00:05:22.610" style="s2">my own writing here a given and what I</p>

<p begin="00:05:22.610" end="00:05:27.140" style="s2">vision I need to give to the world I</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.050" end="00:05:30.230" style="s2">need to present it often more often in</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.140" end="00:05:32.150" style="s2">the pro side in how do we refill the cup</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.230" end="00:05:33.440" style="s2">instead of arguing about how it got</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.150" end="00:05:35.990" style="s2">empty in the first place</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.440" end="00:05:37.910" style="s2">and that it&#39;s empty and convincing</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.990" end="00:05:40.640" style="s2">people it&#39;s empty how do we fill up a</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.910" end="00:05:43.520" style="s2">cup and that is what I am here to this</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.640" end="00:05:46.490" style="s2">planet to do is to create a world that</p>
