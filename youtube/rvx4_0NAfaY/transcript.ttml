<p begin="00:03:58.560" end="00:04:05.820" style="s2">of consciousness is something like a</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.550" end="00:04:08.070" style="s2">state of flow but that the skill the</p>

<p begin="00:04:08.070" end="00:04:12.600" style="s2">particular skill of rock climbing or</p>

<p begin="00:05:50.310" end="00:05:54.680" style="s2">you&#39;re using the flow States capacity</p>

<p begin="00:11:15.270" end="00:11:20.190" style="s2">of wood and it looks like something very</p>

<p begin="00:11:20.190" end="00:11:24.600" style="s2">attractive so the monkey grabs it with</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.930" end="00:11:26.130" style="s2">its hand and it gets stuck and then it</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.600" end="00:11:28.680" style="s2">uses its other hand to try and free</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.130" end="00:11:30.300" style="s2">itself and it gets stuck so it uses its</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.680" end="00:11:32.040" style="s2">right foot and then its left foot and</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.300" end="00:11:33.870" style="s2">then it puts its head and smelt on and</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.040" end="00:11:40.080" style="s2">then it&#39;s completely trapped and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.870" end="00:11:42.770" style="s2">the hunter comes and kills it okay but</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.080" end="00:11:42.770" style="s2">decentering</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.460" end="00:11:54.540" style="s2">can alleviate that but if you are still</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.090" end="00:12:01.400" style="s2">pursuing this as an isolated individual</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.540" end="00:12:08.330" style="s2">as an autodidact then think about how</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.400" end="00:12:10.560" style="s2">ill-prepared unskilled untutored and</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.330" end="00:12:16.920" style="s2">egocentric li you are trying to confront</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.560" end="00:12:23.340" style="s2">this radical transformation that is why</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.920" end="00:12:28.490" style="s2">I think it is a very poor idea for</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.340" end="00:12:33.270" style="s2">people to take psychedelics without</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.490" end="00:12:36.150" style="s2">having them placed within a wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.270" end="00:12:43.440" style="s2">tradition in which they have a committed</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.150" end="00:12:47.250" style="s2">community that can give outside the</p>

<p begin="00:12:47.250" end="00:12:53.150" style="s2">process and handle these transformations</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.970" end="00:12:56.720" style="s2">but once again I point to you too</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.150" end="00:12:59.270" style="s2">an aspect of the meaning crisis we have</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.720" end="00:13:01.040" style="s2">institutions of information we have</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.270" end="00:13:04.900" style="s2">institutions of knowledge we have</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.040" end="00:13:08.990" style="s2">traditions and we have respected experts</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.900" end="00:13:14.360" style="s2">who give us guidance we do not have this</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.990" end="00:13:16.250" style="s2">before wisdom now what is amazing of</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.360" end="00:13:19.520" style="s2">course is that some individuals like sit</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.250" end="00:13:23.300" style="s2">hearta are able to do it as individuals</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.520" end="00:13:26.990" style="s2">I want to point out two things about</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.300" end="00:13:30.560" style="s2">that they deserve our admiration for</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.990" end="00:13:32.450" style="s2">successfully doing it as individuals</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.560" end="00:13:34.940" style="s2">even though the Buddha had training from</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.450" end="00:13:39.650" style="s2">other people all along the way but we</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.940" end="00:13:42.250" style="s2">should not take from that some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.650" end="00:13:46.970" style="s2">promotion of our North American</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.250" end="00:13:51.290" style="s2">individualism because the Buddha made it</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.970" end="00:13:54.470" style="s2">very clear that the Sangha or the</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.290" end="00:13:56.750" style="s2">community was necessary for the</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.470" end="00:14:03.590" style="s2">cultivation of these transformative</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.750" end="00:14:09.830" style="s2">States so you&#39;ve got this radical</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.590" end="00:14:11.270" style="s2">decentering they can afford wisdom and I</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.830" end="00:14:12.950" style="s2">don&#39;t want to try and show you how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.270" end="00:14:15.710" style="s2">not just a perspective of knowing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.950" end="00:14:20.090" style="s2">not just a radical transformation in our</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.710" end="00:14:22.580" style="s2">salience landscape this is a</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.090" end="00:14:25.280" style="s2">participatory change this involves not</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.580" end="00:14:28.850" style="s2">just a machinery of cognition or the</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.280" end="00:14:31.520" style="s2">machinery of consciousness this alters</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.850" end="00:14:33.440" style="s2">the machinery of the self and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.520" end="00:14:38.990" style="s2">is also fundamentally a transformation</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.440" end="00:14:40.400" style="s2">of character never participatory knowing</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.990" end="00:14:42.830" style="s2">is knowing by conforming well the</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.400" end="00:14:47.110" style="s2">radical at oneness of these brings about</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.830" end="00:14:47.110" style="s2">a radical kind of participatory knowing</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.530" end="00:14:53.570" style="s2">we&#39;ll come back to this when we return</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.420" end="00:14:55.640" style="s2">and talk about plutinos but right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.570" end="00:14:58.610" style="s2">so beautiful precisely because the</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.640" end="00:15:01.040" style="s2">coupling is so profound and think about</p>

<p begin="00:23:23.999" end="00:23:31.899" style="s2">you&#39;re always sampling from the world so</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.059" end="00:23:34.690" style="s2">here&#39;s your experience and then here&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:23:58.679" end="00:24:06.210" style="s2">so for example if I was in class at U of</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.490" end="00:24:08.909" style="s2">T and I let say season even huge class</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.210" end="00:24:11.280" style="s2">500 students psych 100 I say how many</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.909" end="00:24:13.260" style="s2">people here think that student tuition</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.280" end="00:24:15.720" style="s2">should be reduced or schools should be</p>

<p begin="00:24:15.720" end="00:24:19.530" style="s2">should I then conclude look the</p>

<p begin="00:25:34.559" end="00:25:40.590" style="s2">this is called data compression the line</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.840" end="00:25:42.750" style="s2">of best fit why do we do that we do that</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.590" end="00:25:44.100" style="s2">in science because what we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.750" end="00:25:48.000" style="s2">find is the function that will</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.100" end="00:25:51.120" style="s2">generalize that will go to all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.000" end="00:25:52.890" style="s2">different contexts that will not be true</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.120" end="00:25:55.020" style="s2">just of this sample but will be true of</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.890" end="00:25:57.690" style="s2">the population but what the networks do</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.020" end="00:25:58.280" style="s2">is they do this they over fit to the</p>

<p begin="00:25:58.280" end="00:26:03.419" style="s2">they track a function that perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.960" end="00:26:07.799" style="s2">describes the sample but does not</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.419" end="00:26:09.450" style="s2">generalize to the population precisely</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.799" end="00:26:14.520" style="s2">because they&#39;re so powerful</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.450" end="00:26:16.590" style="s2">they over fit so what do you do well you</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.520" end="00:26:19.590" style="s2">you can you can throw some noise into</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.590" end="00:26:21.120" style="s2">the system you can turn off you can do</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.590" end="00:26:23.430" style="s2">drop out you can turn off half of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.120" end="00:26:26.220" style="s2">nodes you basically disrupt the</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.430" end="00:26:28.650" style="s2">processing a lot because what the</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.220" end="00:26:30.810" style="s2">disruption does is it prevents you from</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.650" end="00:26:33.630" style="s2">overfitting to the data and an avowal</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.810" end="00:26:35.910" style="s2">aoz you to compress and what does the</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.630" end="00:26:38.850" style="s2">compression do it allows you to find the</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.910" end="00:26:41.700" style="s2">real invariants the real patterns that</p>

<p begin="00:26:41.700" end="00:26:53.250" style="s2">contexts now of course right you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.930" end="00:26:54.960" style="s2">want to under fit if you under fit then</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.250" end="00:26:58.320" style="s2">you&#39;re not picking up on any patterns at</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.960" end="00:27:01.050" style="s2">all so notice again you these systems</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.320" end="00:27:03.870" style="s2">have to toggle they have to toggle back</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.050" end="00:27:05.940" style="s2">and forth they have to disrupt right</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.870" end="00:27:07.680" style="s2">very analogous to breaking frame in</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.940" end="00:27:09.810" style="s2">order so they can make a better frame</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.680" end="00:27:15.740" style="s2">and they&#39;re trying to find that sweet</p>

<p begin="00:27:15.740" end="00:27:23.990" style="s2">compression to detect real patterns that</p>

<p begin="00:27:23.990" end="00:27:36.710" style="s2">what we know is that again you have to</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.570" end="00:27:41.510" style="s2">have disruptive strategies set within</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.710" end="00:27:44.010" style="s2">powerful pattern detection that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.510" end="00:27:46.650" style="s2">exactly what we&#39;re seeing at work as I</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.010" end="00:27:48.300" style="s2">mentioned to you in these people that</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.650" end="00:27:50.900" style="s2">are pursuing these higher states of</p>

<p begin="00:28:05.010" end="00:28:08.240" style="s2">very very important</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.080" end="00:28:15.760" style="s2">if you want to be really good at jamming</p>

<p begin="00:28:33.650" end="00:28:39.020" style="s2">notice what I&#39;m showing you here the</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.900" end="00:28:43.669" style="s2">machines are doing right the compression</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.020" end="00:28:45.049" style="s2">that compression is right that toggling</p>

<p begin="00:28:54.200" end="00:29:01.309" style="s2">they&#39;re doing stuff that seems I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.100" end="00:29:03.320" style="s2">plausible to say is analogous to what we</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.309" end="00:29:05.659" style="s2">see going on at the psychological level</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.320" end="00:29:08.330" style="s2">within people what about at the brain</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.659" end="00:29:09.890" style="s2">level well this is where we have to turn</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.330" end="00:29:12.740" style="s2">to Newburgh because he&#39;s done most of</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.890" end="00:29:15.700" style="s2">the work on tracking brains as people</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.740" end="00:29:20.780" style="s2">are having these kinds of experiences</p>

<p begin="00:29:20.780" end="00:29:26.270" style="s2">get increased activity in the frontal</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.970" end="00:29:28.250" style="s2">area and the parietal area these are the</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.270" end="00:29:31.100" style="s2">two areas a frontal parietal connection</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.250" end="00:29:34.010" style="s2">that is most associated with your</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.100" end="00:29:36.530" style="s2">general intelligence your ability to</p>

<p begin="00:29:36.530" end="00:29:40.400" style="s2">the world because that&#39;s what your</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.610" end="00:29:43.450" style="s2">general intelligence is so the initially</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.400" end="00:29:48.320" style="s2">you see these areas get hyperactive and</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.450" end="00:29:54.080" style="s2">then you see the opposite you see them</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.320" end="00:29:57.520" style="s2">hypoactive so huge increase followed by</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.080" end="00:29:57.520" style="s2">a huge decrease</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.700" end="00:30:07.130" style="s2">now throughout you have throughout all</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.880" end="00:30:08.720" style="s2">of this this is the frontal parietal you</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.130" end="00:30:10.490" style="s2">have enhanced activity in the thalamus</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.720" end="00:30:12.260" style="s2">this is the area of the brain that tries</p>

<p begin="00:30:23.180" end="00:30:31.220" style="s2">experience is it&#39;s just like what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.550" end="00:30:33.470" style="s2">going on in insight you initially bring</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.220" end="00:30:36.290" style="s2">all this machinery to bear to frame it</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.470" end="00:30:39.340" style="s2">and then you have to massively disrupt</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.290" end="00:30:43.750" style="s2">it and break it and then the system re</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.340" end="00:30:46.400" style="s2">self organizes and that is precisely</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.750" end="00:30:59.770" style="s2">what&#39;s going on I would suggest to you</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.400" end="00:30:59.770" style="s2">in these experiences so</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.840" end="00:31:09.899" style="s2">what is happening in the brain for</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.690" end="00:31:12.849" style="s2">example in psychedelic experiences</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.899" end="00:31:16.899" style="s2">because you&#39;ll often see this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.849" end="00:31:18.840" style="s2">shift what&#39;s important and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.899" end="00:31:21.669" style="s2">bunch of people doing work on this</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.840" end="00:31:24.759" style="s2">metastability so what for example</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.669" end="00:31:26.739" style="s2">psilocybin does according to recent work</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.759" end="00:31:28.509" style="s2">done by Lord Adel is increases</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.739" end="00:31:30.549" style="s2">metastability in the brain so if you</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.509" end="00:31:33.249" style="s2">look at the work of Kelso tog Noli and</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.549" end="00:31:34.869" style="s2">others what metastability is is a state</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.249" end="00:31:36.969" style="s2">in the brain that&#39;s doing this</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.869" end="00:31:38.889" style="s2">complexification I talked about so</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.969" end="00:31:42.190" style="s2">normally your brain is integrating</p>

<p begin="00:31:47.589" end="00:31:52.570" style="s2">you get is a state called meta stability</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.679" end="00:31:54.519" style="s2">where and this is a state in which the</p>

<p begin="00:33:58.139" end="00:34:04.070" style="s2">context you need a tradition and</p>

<p begin="00:34:16.019" end="00:34:20.879" style="s2">state why should this state serve as the</p>

<p begin="00:34:26.190" end="00:34:33.059" style="s2">Zed right you need that claim justified</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.000" end="00:34:35.309" style="s2">not just described and explained you</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.059" end="00:34:38.059" style="s2">need to justify what would make it a</p>

<p begin="00:35:21.480" end="00:35:25.289" style="s2">the sense I&#39;m using I&#39;m using it in the</p>

<p begin="00:35:55.680" end="00:36:00.870" style="s2">you have to rely on plausibility now</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.610" end="00:36:03.960" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of work on plausibility</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.870" end="00:36:06.960" style="s2">and I&#39;m just going to try to sketch to</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.960" end="00:36:09.920" style="s2">you what I think will work on doing with</p>

<p begin="00:36:30.600" end="00:36:39.240" style="s2">what I think it is to make something</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.180" end="00:36:44.310" style="s2">plausible first of all it involves what</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.240" end="00:36:45.390" style="s2">Russia calls trustworthiness I think</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.310" end="00:36:49.200" style="s2">there&#39;s an important way in which</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.390" end="00:36:50.880" style="s2">trustworthiness comes about you can see</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.200" end="00:36:55.530" style="s2">this in some of the work that Kyle has</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.880" end="00:36:59.700" style="s2">done on explanations we prefer we regard</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.530" end="00:37:04.490" style="s2">a particular proposal or a construct or</p>

<p begin="00:37:07.020" end="00:37:11.310" style="s2">many independent but converging lines of</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.840" end="00:37:17.430" style="s2">evidence let me give you a clear</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.310" end="00:37:19.470" style="s2">concrete example alright you will regard</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.430" end="00:37:21.210" style="s2">as more real information that comes</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.470" end="00:37:24.200" style="s2">through multiple senses as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.210" end="00:37:27.600" style="s2">one sense if I&#39;m only seeing something</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.200" end="00:37:29.760" style="s2">there&#39;s a good chance that it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.600" end="00:37:32.670" style="s2">illusion or a delusion caused by the</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.760" end="00:37:36.980" style="s2">subjectivity of my seeing but if I can</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.670" end="00:37:41.820" style="s2">see it and touch it and hear it and</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.980" end="00:37:45.410" style="s2">smell it then the chance is that each</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.820" end="00:37:51.180" style="s2">one of those independent senses are</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.410" end="00:37:54.780" style="s2">right producing an illusion is radically</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.180" end="00:37:57.660" style="s2">diminished the fact that they all are</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.780" end="00:37:59.370" style="s2">telling me that same thing now that</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.660" end="00:38:01.090" style="s2">doesn&#39;t give me certainty but it gives</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.370" end="00:38:03.820" style="s2">me trustworthiness</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.090" end="00:38:08.620" style="s2">it reduces the probability and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.820" end="00:38:15.120" style="s2">what trustworthiness is right it reduces</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.620" end="00:38:15.120" style="s2">the probability that I&#39;m self deceived</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.900" end="00:38:23.200" style="s2">now that&#39;s not the same thing as</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.800" end="00:38:25.150" style="s2">certainty because unfortunately for</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.200" end="00:38:28.780" style="s2">example there is a form of schizophrenia</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.150" end="00:38:32.440" style="s2">in which people not only hear voices but</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.780" end="00:38:34.060" style="s2">they see people attached to those voices</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.440" end="00:38:36.460" style="s2">and when they reach out to touch the</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.060" end="00:38:37.960" style="s2">person they get a tactile illusion and</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.460" end="00:38:39.820" style="s2">it&#39;s very hard to convince those people</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.960" end="00:38:43.240" style="s2">that their illusions aren&#39;t real</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.820" end="00:38:46.090" style="s2">precisely because this is highly</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.240" end="00:38:48.760" style="s2">trustworthy this is why science likes</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.090" end="00:38:51.610" style="s2">numbers we like numbers because they</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.760" end="00:38:58.200" style="s2">allow us to converge the senses look you</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.610" end="00:39:06.160" style="s2">can see three you can touch three one</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.200" end="00:39:08.440" style="s2">two three you can hear three we like</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.160" end="00:39:10.600" style="s2">numbers not because we&#39;re fascists or</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.440" end="00:39:13.810" style="s2">something in science we like numbers</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.600" end="00:39:16.570" style="s2">because numbers quantification help us</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.810" end="00:39:19.600" style="s2">to increase the trustworthiness of our</p>

<p begin="00:39:37.620" end="00:39:47.950" style="s2">so we&#39;re converging to some processing</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.960" end="00:39:49.270" style="s2">state here but we also want something to</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.950" end="00:39:51.880" style="s2">be the case because we&#39;re not just</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.270" end="00:39:54.670" style="s2">looking backwards into how we got there</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.880" end="00:40:01.870" style="s2">we&#39;re also looking forward what we can</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.670" end="00:40:04.300" style="s2">do with it what we want is we want a</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.870" end="00:40:07.240" style="s2">model that we can now apply to many new</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.300" end="00:40:11.490" style="s2">domains that will open up the world for</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.240" end="00:40:11.490" style="s2">us that&#39;s multi apt</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.589" end="00:40:18.680" style="s2">this is like again taking a martial-arts</p>

<p begin="00:40:23.959" end="00:40:30.709" style="s2">it&#39;s highly functional so why do I want</p>

<p begin="00:40:30.709" end="00:40:36.319" style="s2">in many different places this is I I I</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.489" end="00:40:39.410" style="s2">would argue what people mean when they</p>

<p begin="00:40:41.809" end="00:40:45.229" style="s2">adaptive enough it&#39;s multi app that you</p>
