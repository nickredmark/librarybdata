<p begin="00:00:24.359" end="00:00:30.449" style="s2">entirely baling wire that we are using</p>

<p begin="00:01:09.060" end="00:01:15.720" style="s2">so what do we do people are cowering to</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.030" end="00:01:17.970" style="s2">the Mao ISM well my feeling is is that</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.720" end="00:01:19.950" style="s2">they may be smarter than us because at</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.970" end="00:01:22.110" style="s2">some level we may be in the process of</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.950" end="00:01:24.030" style="s2">outsmarting ourselves given how stupid</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.110" end="00:01:29.100" style="s2">this moment is and it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.030" end="00:01:30.600" style="s2">remarkable to me that if you know as</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.100" end="00:01:31.400" style="s2">I&#39;ve said before if you had a movement</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.600" end="00:01:34.380" style="s2">called</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.400" end="00:01:36.840" style="s2">save the adorable baby penguins from</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.380" end="00:01:38.970" style="s2">hunger no matter what the movement stood</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.840" end="00:01:40.439" style="s2">for you would have a lot of people who</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.970" end="00:01:42.869" style="s2">would sign on because they want to</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.439" end="00:01:44.850" style="s2">communicate just how beautiful and</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.869" end="00:01:46.590" style="s2">decent they are dude I didn&#39;t know there</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.850" end="00:01:49.079" style="s2">was such a movement I&#39;m making a mental</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.590" end="00:01:49.860" style="s2">note right now to go sign up for it as</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.079" end="00:01:50.970" style="s2">soon as this is done</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.860" end="00:01:52.770" style="s2">you heard it here well I guess you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.970" end="00:01:58.710" style="s2">heard of here second right save the baby</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.770" end="00:02:01.729" style="s2">penguins from hunger there it is I also</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.710" end="00:02:03.990" style="s2">should say somebody left a comment</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.729" end="00:02:06.509" style="s2">recently on one of my videos which I</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.990" end="00:02:11.069" style="s2">quite liked which was we all see the</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.509" end="00:02:13.140" style="s2">cheese some of us see the trap that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.069" end="00:02:13.680" style="s2">very good that&#39;s sweet</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.140" end="00:02:15.719" style="s2">that is very</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.680" end="00:02:18.739" style="s2">good yeah we all see the cheese some of</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.719" end="00:02:22.769" style="s2">us see the trap that&#39;s that&#39;s very well</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.739" end="00:02:25.349" style="s2">I agree I saw somebody referring to an</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.769" end="00:02:28.769" style="s2">outbreak of anti-semitism which I</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.349" end="00:02:31.549" style="s2">thought was a very good turn of phrase</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.769" end="00:02:34.170" style="s2">for what is it sure what is happening</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.549" end="00:02:36.709" style="s2">all right so what else can you tell us</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.170" end="00:02:43.409" style="s2">what are we missing about this moment</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.709" end="00:02:49.230" style="s2">well is that some concept of wronged is</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.409" end="00:02:52.409" style="s2">substituting for some concept of correct</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.230" end="00:02:58.260" style="s2">so the more wronged you can claim to</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.409" end="00:02:59.790" style="s2">have been the more correct you have to</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.260" end="00:03:01.950" style="s2">be because no one is allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.790" end="00:03:03.540" style="s2">challenge you the act of challenging a</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.950" end="00:03:06.150" style="s2">person who claims to have been wronged</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.540" end="00:03:09.090" style="s2">with an intersectional claim on that on</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.150" end="00:03:12.569" style="s2">that issue of oppression is a person who</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.090" end="00:03:14.730" style="s2">cannot be disputed and so the issue of</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.569" end="00:03:17.870" style="s2">if I have less intersectional and you</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.730" end="00:03:21.810" style="s2">are more more intersectional as per the</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.870" end="00:03:23.909" style="s2">concept of oppression then effectively I</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.810" end="00:03:25.769" style="s2">can&#39;t be right and tell you that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.909" end="00:03:29.220" style="s2">wrong and therefore I have to cheat you</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.769" end="00:03:31.769" style="s2">of reasonable feedback and this is where</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.220" end="00:03:34.590" style="s2">lived experience and claims of identity</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.769" end="00:03:37.169" style="s2">are used also to game the system because</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.590" end="00:03:38.760" style="s2">not only does your does your position</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.169" end="00:03:39.889" style="s2">and the progressive stack how many</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.760" end="00:03:42.509" style="s2">intersectional points you have</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.889" end="00:03:45.150" style="s2">contribute to how wrong you can claim to</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.509" end="00:03:50.759" style="s2">be but it&#39;s only you who gets to do the</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.150" end="00:03:53.489" style="s2">math on how wrong do you are because I</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.759" end="00:03:57.030" style="s2">think that one of the problems that you</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.489" end="00:04:00.379" style="s2">have to deal with is that the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.030" end="00:04:04.769" style="s2">idea is that my history of being wronged</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.379" end="00:04:08.849" style="s2">has to do with my history of being able</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.769" end="00:04:10.560" style="s2">to succeed within a system and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.849" end="00:04:12.840" style="s2">problem of let&#39;s say the overseas</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.560" end="00:04:15.930" style="s2">Chinese or the Jews is that you have</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.840" end="00:04:18.479" style="s2">people who are often oppressed but who</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.930" end="00:04:23.520" style="s2">are often very successful while wrong</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.479" end="00:04:26.940" style="s2">and the biggest problem here is that for</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.520" end="00:04:29.940" style="s2">example the Jewish claim on</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.940" end="00:04:33.650" style="s2">having been wronged is particularly</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.940" end="00:04:36.540" style="s2">problematic for this movement because it</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.650" end="00:04:39.870" style="s2">rivals or even can exceed the black</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.540" end="00:04:42.350" style="s2">claim and therefore the claim must be</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.870" end="00:04:45.000" style="s2">disposed of with extreme prejudice</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.350" end="00:04:49.310" style="s2">because it gives the lie to the idea</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.000" end="00:04:54.980" style="s2">that one&#39;s level of oppression and one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.310" end="00:04:54.980" style="s2">ability to sort of navigate the system</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.070" end="00:04:58.710" style="s2">the assumed linkage is called into</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.050" end="00:05:03.450" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.710" end="00:05:06.480" style="s2">yeah I think hey one more let me give</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.450" end="00:05:08.610" style="s2">another example of the kind of reasoning</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.480" end="00:05:10.730" style="s2">one may not introduce are you familiar</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.610" end="00:05:18.750" style="s2">with the killing of Daniel shaver in</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.730" end="00:05:24.090" style="s2">2016 no Daniel shaver was in a motel I</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.750" end="00:05:26.250" style="s2">think in Arizona and he had some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.090" end="00:05:29.780" style="s2">a gun for pest control I think a pellet</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.250" end="00:05:32.820" style="s2">gun that had been seen in a window and</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.780" end="00:05:35.790" style="s2">the police showed up and they forced him</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.820" end="00:05:38.040" style="s2">prostrate into the hallway and they gave</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.790" end="00:05:39.630" style="s2">very complicated instructions for what</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.040" end="00:05:42.600" style="s2">he was to do if he didn&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.630" end="00:05:44.910" style="s2">killed on the spot and having some</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.600" end="00:05:47.520" style="s2">alcohol in his system he was unable to</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.910" end="00:05:51.090" style="s2">follow the instructions and was shot</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.520" end="00:05:55.710" style="s2">five times I think died instantly if you</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.090" end="00:05:59.180" style="s2">imagine that George Floyd who was by all</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.710" end="00:06:01.320" style="s2">turns somebody who did not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.180" end="00:06:02.970" style="s2">believe that black lives mattered</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.320" end="00:06:04.830" style="s2">because I think he was present in a home</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.970" end="00:06:08.220" style="s2">invasion into a pregnant black woman&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.830" end="00:06:10.800" style="s2">house previously served five years for</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.220" end="00:06:12.210" style="s2">letting a bunch of armed men into the</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.800" end="00:06:14.340" style="s2">house while he pointed a gun at this</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.210" end="00:06:17.250" style="s2">woman if I understand correctly you have</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.340" end="00:06:20.760" style="s2">a situation whereby were the two</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.250" end="00:06:22.800" style="s2">killings exchanged I have no question</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.760" end="00:06:26.130" style="s2">that black lives matter would be enraged</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.800" end="00:06:29.340" style="s2">by the killing in Arizona and relatively</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.130" end="00:06:31.560" style="s2">mute on the killing in Minneapolis and</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.340" end="00:06:34.400" style="s2">so what we&#39;re talking about is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.560" end="00:06:38.460" style="s2">talking about a level of clairvoyance of</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.400" end="00:06:40.490" style="s2">a right to infer the belief that no</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.460" end="00:06:43.460" style="s2">white person hears the police</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.490" end="00:06:46.940" style="s2">this is only understandable by black</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.460" end="00:06:50.630" style="s2">people the entire concept is beyond</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.940" end="00:06:54.319" style="s2">preposterous but it plays into a sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.630" end="00:06:56.620" style="s2">that I think white people and others who</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.319" end="00:06:59.150" style="s2">do not have many black friends are</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.620" end="00:07:00.560" style="s2">incredibly frightened of this and I</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.150" end="00:07:02.509" style="s2">think those of us who do have black</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.560" end="00:07:05.449" style="s2">friends and strong black contacts are</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.509" end="00:07:08.270" style="s2">completely confused because many of them</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.449" end="00:07:10.759" style="s2">are saying what the f yeah in fact I had</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.270" end="00:07:14.270" style="s2">forgotten the the young man&#39;s name who</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.759" end="00:07:16.310" style="s2">was shot but he is obviously in this</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.270" end="00:07:18.830" style="s2">clip quite terrified that he is about to</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.310" end="00:07:21.380" style="s2">be shot he&#39;s trying he&#39;s pleading for</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.830" end="00:07:24.259" style="s2">them not to shoot him and I think he his</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.380" end="00:07:28.940" style="s2">shorts he adjusted his shorts as he was</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.259" end="00:07:30.380" style="s2">trying to comply with the orders and was</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.940" end="00:07:31.970" style="s2">shot so the point is the fear is</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.380" end="00:07:34.699" style="s2">obviously there despite the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.970" end="00:07:39.220" style="s2">he&#39;s a white guy facing heavily armed</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.699" end="00:07:43.190" style="s2">cops etc you&#39;re right it is it is a very</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.220" end="00:07:48.110" style="s2">interesting counterpoint and I think I</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.190" end="00:07:50.840" style="s2">mean the shut down stem idea is about</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.110" end="00:07:53.900" style="s2">shutting down the tools with which to</p>

<p begin="00:07:56.090" end="00:08:01.340" style="s2">intuitive a claim is and in fact what we</p>

<p begin="00:08:19.460" end="00:08:23.090" style="s2">cult I mean I think what you&#39;re what</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.409" end="00:08:27.590" style="s2">you&#39;re seeing is you&#39;re seeing an</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.090" end="00:08:29.690" style="s2">ideology occupying a place in the human</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.590" end="00:08:32.149" style="s2">mind where the you know there&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.690" end="00:08:34.760" style="s2">like a chomskyan like pre grammar for</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.149" end="00:08:37.190" style="s2">religion many people don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.760" end="00:08:39.200" style="s2">religion this is clearly inhabiting that</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.190" end="00:08:41.810" style="s2">place where you have a closed circle of</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.200" end="00:08:46.339" style="s2">ideas which is sort of the sealed</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.810" end="00:08:51.050" style="s2">epistemology and science is the same</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.339" end="00:08:53.390" style="s2">threat to this that it is to claims of</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.050" end="00:08:55.579" style="s2">the Catholic Church about you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.390" end="00:08:59.870" style="s2">if there&#39;s a miracle where milk is</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.579" end="00:09:01.940" style="s2">coming from the eyes of a statue you</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.870" end="00:09:03.680" style="s2">know more or less we have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.940" end="00:09:06.500" style="s2">sensors and detectors we can probably</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.680" end="00:09:09.560" style="s2">tell through inspection if a miracle is</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.500" end="00:09:11.810" style="s2">occurring and this is a miracle in the</p>

<p begin="00:09:11.810" end="00:09:16.730" style="s2">is it&#39;s not true</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.920" end="00:09:17.959" style="s2">so the point good well the point I was</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.730" end="00:09:19.519" style="s2">making earlier I don&#39;t think is a</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.959" end="00:09:22.820" style="s2">simpler version of this but actually an</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.519" end="00:09:25.010" style="s2">adjacent point which is that people who</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.820" end="00:09:25.970" style="s2">don&#39;t rise in the progressive stack</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.010" end="00:09:27.980" style="s2">because they don&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.970" end="00:09:30.140" style="s2">intersectional points because their</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.980" end="00:09:32.329" style="s2">lineage or their sex doesn&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.140" end="00:09:34.550" style="s2">history of oppression there are claims</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.329" end="00:09:37.010" style="s2">that can be made now to game the system</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.550" end="00:09:38.839" style="s2">and this is what we&#39;re seeing with with</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.010" end="00:09:42.490" style="s2">the trans ideology and again this is not</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.839" end="00:09:42.490" style="s2">to say that trans isn&#39;t real and rare</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.459" end="00:09:50.120" style="s2">but it but it&#39;s important right I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.320" end="00:09:53.050" style="s2">actually so this this is this is one</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.120" end="00:09:56.180" style="s2">point where Brett and I do do this thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.050" end="00:09:58.760" style="s2">because we actually do know trans people</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.180" end="00:10:00.829" style="s2">and you most people don&#39;t actually right</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.760" end="00:10:02.480" style="s2">we actually had trans students who we</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.829" end="00:10:06.290" style="s2">don&#39;t talk about because their privacy</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.480" end="00:10:08.570" style="s2">is paramount and you know who who we</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.290" end="00:10:11.449" style="s2">understand to be really and truly trans</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.570" end="00:10:13.120" style="s2">and to to not be out on the streets</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.449" end="00:10:16.519" style="s2">talking about how trans they are because</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.120" end="00:10:19.010" style="s2">they live in this deeply horrifying</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.519" end="00:10:21.380" style="s2">position of having their actual</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.010" end="00:10:23.329" style="s2">biological sex be out of step deeply out</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.380" end="00:10:25.370" style="s2">of step with what their brains are</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.329" end="00:10:27.740" style="s2">telling them about what their sex is so</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.370" end="00:10:29.570" style="s2">that that is a real but super rare</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.740" end="00:10:32.209" style="s2">phenomenon so I will I will do it in</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.570" end="00:10:33.709" style="s2">this case Eric just because I because</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.209" end="00:10:35.240" style="s2">most people watching probably don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.709" end="00:10:45.890" style="s2">any trans people and it&#39;s really easy to</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.240" end="00:10:47.750" style="s2">dismiss the trans rights activism as the</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.890" end="00:10:49.579" style="s2">future portrayed is believing and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.750" end="00:10:52.130" style="s2">would like to have a general statement</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.579" end="00:10:55.220" style="s2">that anybody who&#39;s put as many hours</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.130" end="00:10:58.130" style="s2">into the world as I have this is like</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.220" end="00:11:01.660" style="s2">the jizya in Islam where you have to pay</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.130" end="00:11:04.310" style="s2">a constant tax at a higher rate than</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.660" end="00:11:05.870" style="s2">anyone else and effectively what they do</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.310" end="00:11:06.860" style="s2">is they grind you into a pulp</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.870" end="00:11:08.660" style="s2">so what I</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.860" end="00:11:10.790" style="s2">say is I don&#39;t believe that this is</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.660" end="00:11:16.850" style="s2">actually as opaque as we&#39;re pretending</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.790" end="00:11:19.430" style="s2">it is the idea that this is you know a</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.850" end="00:11:23.120" style="s2">highly politicized demonstration of</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.430" end="00:11:25.520" style="s2">power I think is evident to everyone</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.120" end="00:11:29.930" style="s2">whether or not we echo it is a different</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.520" end="00:11:33.290" style="s2">question but I can tell you if you want</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.930" end="00:11:34.340" style="s2">to know that the federal government</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.290" end="00:11:36.970" style="s2">through the National Science Foundation</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.340" end="00:11:39.260" style="s2">and the National Academy of Sciences</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.970" end="00:11:41.510" style="s2">studied the fact that a tight labor</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.260" end="00:11:44.780" style="s2">market would bring women and minorities</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.510" end="00:11:49.670" style="s2">into science and decided that it was far</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.780" end="00:11:52.010" style="s2">too expensive both in terms of a fear</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.670" end="00:11:54.530" style="s2">that the quality would be lower and that</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.010" end="00:11:56.960" style="s2">the price would be too high so they</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.530" end="00:12:00.110" style="s2">opted for a program to fake a labor</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.960" end="00:12:02.380" style="s2">shortage in the 1980s which is of course</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.110" end="00:12:05.690" style="s2">impossible in a capitalist economy</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.380" end="00:12:08.660" style="s2">because the wage rate rises to whatever</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.690" end="00:12:10.760" style="s2">the correct level of need is and if</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.660" end="00:12:14.690" style="s2">these people weren&#39;t all interested in</p>

<p begin="00:31:19.070" end="00:31:25.220" style="s2">problem is that we have been saying</p>

<p begin="00:32:10.610" end="00:32:16.190" style="s2">and you don&#39;t have claims on what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.590" end="00:32:18.500" style="s2">trying to do now is such a new message</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.190" end="00:32:20.720" style="s2">to so many people the idea that you</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.500" end="00:32:24.020" style="s2">could say hey you don&#39;t get to do this</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.720" end="00:32:25.760" style="s2">say no just the way you have to say no</p>

<p begin="00:32:56.059" end="00:33:00.080" style="s2">this feels like a complete betrayal of</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.770" end="00:33:01.730" style="s2">everything that I&#39;ve studied in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.080" end="00:33:03.410" style="s2">black community everything that I love</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.730" end="00:33:05.059" style="s2">about the black community I just don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:33:05.059" end="00:33:09.650" style="s2">of non blackness well yeah it is it is</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.670" end="00:33:11.780" style="s2">that but as you point out about the</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.650" end="00:33:12.930" style="s2">defund the police movement which is</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.780" end="00:33:15.360" style="s2">really a shutdown the</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.930" end="00:33:17.730" style="s2">movement you don&#39;t have the right to put</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.360" end="00:33:18.930" style="s2">people in that danger you may not have</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.730" end="00:33:19.920" style="s2">the right to put yourself in that danger</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.930" end="00:33:21.420" style="s2">but you sure as hell don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.920" end="00:33:23.100" style="s2">right to put anybody else in that danger</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.420" end="00:33:25.620" style="s2">but in this case what we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.100" end="00:33:26.910" style="s2">talking about is I was I was trying to</p>

<p begin="00:33:26.910" end="00:33:31.110" style="s2">on he was not aware of shut down stem</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.740" end="00:33:33.600" style="s2">and I was trying to compel under this</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.110" end="00:33:36.270" style="s2">and and the thing is what I said to him</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.600" end="00:33:39.000" style="s2">is this is the dawning of a new Dark Age</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.270" end="00:33:40.950" style="s2">that&#39;s what this is this is the uninvent</p>
