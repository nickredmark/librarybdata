<p begin="00:00:16.920" end="00:00:24.720" style="s2">meaning crisis so last time I was making</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.789" end="00:00:28.710" style="s2">a proposal to you of how we could</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.720" end="00:00:33.989" style="s2">address the perennial problems and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.710" end="00:00:36.180" style="s2">gave you a systematic set of things too</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.989" end="00:00:38.550" style="s2">that could be cultivated in an</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.180" end="00:00:40.920" style="s2">integrated fashion for addressing</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.550" end="00:00:46.670" style="s2">pronoun problems and then we saw how</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.920" end="00:00:48.870" style="s2">that is interacts with our attempts to</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.670" end="00:00:50.700" style="s2">ameliorate and alleviate the perennial</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.870" end="00:00:53.040" style="s2">problems interact with the historical</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.700" end="00:00:56.640" style="s2">forces and that we get the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.040" end="00:00:59.550" style="s2">undermining of meaning in life and that</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.640" end="00:01:01.290" style="s2">problem set by Woolf and then I propose</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.550" end="00:01:05.610" style="s2">to you that there was a response to that</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.290" end="00:01:09.979" style="s2">in terms of the notion of Agape and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.610" end="00:01:14.490" style="s2">I moved into the direct addressing of</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.979" end="00:01:15.990" style="s2">the historical forces looking about for</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.490" end="00:01:18.840" style="s2">recovery of something like what the</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.990" end="00:01:20.729" style="s2">three orders did for us and then I</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.840" end="00:01:24.780" style="s2">proposed to you that if we took a look</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.729" end="00:01:27.299" style="s2">at for ecology of science</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.780" end="00:01:28.829" style="s2">third generation cogs I and in</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.299" end="00:01:33.389" style="s2">particular some of the insights have</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.829" end="00:01:37.649" style="s2">afforded from that by sorry insights</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.389" end="00:01:39.719" style="s2">afforded by 4e cognitive science third</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.649" end="00:01:42.779" style="s2">generation cogs I and that were pointed</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.719" end="00:01:47.639" style="s2">out by Varela in his article we can see</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.779" end="00:01:51.179" style="s2">a ways in which we can get a worldview</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.639" end="00:01:54.240" style="s2">that strongly situates our meaning</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.179" end="00:01:58.139" style="s2">making processes within it legitimates</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.240" end="00:02:00.889" style="s2">it we talked about how we can recover</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.139" end="00:02:04.169" style="s2">something like the Noma logical order</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.889" end="00:02:07.259" style="s2">and at the normative order and how</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.169" end="00:02:12.620" style="s2">perhaps we can move to something post</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.259" end="00:02:17.480" style="s2">narrative an open-ended optimization</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.620" end="00:02:19.959" style="s2">is seeking for a depth of realization</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.480" end="00:02:23.390" style="s2">rather than a historical combination and</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.959" end="00:02:27.830" style="s2">I proposed to you bringing with it the</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.390" end="00:02:31.190" style="s2">the notion that good and upbringing with</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.830" end="00:02:34.220" style="s2">that whole project of responding to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.190" end="00:02:37.940" style="s2">historical forces and trying to bring</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.220" end="00:02:38.739" style="s2">with it a new notion from a good-enough</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.940" end="00:02:42.440" style="s2">swirl</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.739" end="00:02:46.160" style="s2">transcendence into rather than</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.440" end="00:02:48.650" style="s2">transcendence above or beyond and how</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.160" end="00:02:49.850" style="s2">that is resonant and consonant with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.650" end="00:02:54.440" style="s2">picture that we&#39;ve been working on</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.850" end="00:02:59.569" style="s2">together a couple things remain that are</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.440" end="00:03:00.260" style="s2">central one of course is to give an</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.569" end="00:03:04.940" style="s2">account</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.260" end="00:03:07.640" style="s2">cognitive scientific account of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.940" end="00:03:11.890" style="s2">because of the wisdom framing that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.640" end="00:03:17.950" style="s2">needed for both the cultivation of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.890" end="00:03:22.940" style="s2">responses to the meaning crisis and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.950" end="00:03:25.640" style="s2">use of interpretation of grasping the</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.940" end="00:03:29.959" style="s2">significance of the cognitive scientific</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.640" end="00:03:34.040" style="s2">framework so we need to develop an</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.959" end="00:03:39.920" style="s2">account of wisdom together and I also</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.040" end="00:03:44.569" style="s2">said we need to talk about this notion</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.920" end="00:03:46.880" style="s2">of getting something that&#39;s a religion</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.569" end="00:03:51.049" style="s2">that&#39;s not a religion and what might</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.880" end="00:03:52.819" style="s2">that look like so I want to address the</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.049" end="00:03:55.310" style="s2">second point first because I have less</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.819" end="00:03:57.200" style="s2">to say about it not because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.310" end="00:03:58.700" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.200" end="00:04:03.709" style="s2">I&#39;ve left to say about it because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.700" end="00:04:06.709" style="s2">very tentative and well I want to try</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.709" end="00:04:11.600" style="s2">and talk about it and ultimately a</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.709" end="00:04:14.780" style="s2">suggestive fashion I&#39;m not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.600" end="00:04:17.780" style="s2">found a movement or anything ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.780" end="00:04:19.760" style="s2">or pretentious like that there are many</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.780" end="00:04:22.270" style="s2">people though who are writing books</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.760" end="00:04:25.900" style="s2">about this idea</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.270" end="00:04:28.690" style="s2">I recommend you John Kahrs his book the</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.900" end="00:04:31.870" style="s2">religious case against belief which I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.690" end="00:04:35.680" style="s2">already recommended there&#39;s Unger&#39;s book</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.870" end="00:04:38.320" style="s2">on future religion there&#39;s books like</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.680" end="00:04:42.460" style="s2">religion for atheists and which people</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.320" end="00:04:43.840" style="s2">are I think and I mean this in a serious</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.460" end="00:04:46.120" style="s2">sense but they&#39;re trying to play with</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.840" end="00:04:47.350" style="s2">what does what would it but this might</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.120" end="00:04:49.630" style="s2">look like a religion that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.350" end="00:04:51.009" style="s2">religion and how can it help us to</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.630" end="00:04:54.280" style="s2">address it even people like Richard</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.009" end="00:04:57.930" style="s2">Dawkins are trying to propose you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.280" end="00:05:01.150" style="s2">that we should get cultivate an ability</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.930" end="00:05:03.430" style="s2">ultimately poetic ability to in Dender</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.150" end="00:05:07.449" style="s2">Wonder and awe that is consonant with</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.430" end="00:05:13.750" style="s2">the scientific worldview so a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.449" end="00:05:15.940" style="s2">people are trying to get some conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.750" end="00:05:18.699" style="s2">vocabulary and theoretical grammar going</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.940" end="00:05:20.050" style="s2">for this I so I do not see myself as</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.699" end="00:05:22.210" style="s2">offering anything definitive or</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.050" end="00:05:23.860" style="s2">authoritative but on the basis of what</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.210" end="00:05:27.220" style="s2">we have done together I&#39;d like to try</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.860" end="00:05:31.690" style="s2">and offer some suggestions of what this</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.220" end="00:05:35.710" style="s2">would look like so remember why are we</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.690" end="00:05:39.220" style="s2">setting this problem well we for many of</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.710" end="00:05:41.380" style="s2">us right and the the the group that our</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.220" end="00:05:43.930" style="s2">self identify as the nuns having no</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.380" end="00:05:45.490" style="s2">religion nevertheless a large majority</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.930" end="00:05:48.760" style="s2">of those people are still spiritually</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.490" end="00:05:52.389" style="s2">hungry in important ways returning to</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.760" end="00:05:55.870" style="s2">organized religion is not a viable</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.389" end="00:05:57.639" style="s2">option and part of that has to do with a</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.870" end="00:06:04.360" style="s2">lot of the history that we&#39;ve traced out</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.639" end="00:06:08.949" style="s2">and pursuing pseudo religious political</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.360" end="00:06:12.820" style="s2">ideologies in utopic visions is also not</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.949" end="00:06:17.800" style="s2">viable precisely because of the trauma</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.820" end="00:06:21.310" style="s2">of the 20th century and parts of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.800" end="00:06:22.690" style="s2">21st century in the clash of the pseudo</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.310" end="00:06:24.039" style="s2">religious ideologies in the way they</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.690" end="00:06:28.180" style="s2">drenched the world with blood and</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.039" end="00:06:30.039" style="s2">torture and horror and so I proposed to</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.180" end="00:06:32.440" style="s2">you that nevertheless we need to do</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.039" end="00:06:33.530" style="s2">something like what religion used to do</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.440" end="00:06:37.460" style="s2">we need a</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.530" end="00:06:40.030" style="s2">a comprehensive set of psycho</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.460" end="00:06:44.450" style="s2">technologies that are set within</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.030" end="00:06:47.950" style="s2">communities of practices that allow for</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.450" end="00:06:51.380" style="s2">the comprehensive transformations of</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.950" end="00:06:52.670" style="s2">consciousness cognition character and</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.380" end="00:06:58.730" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.670" end="00:06:59.900" style="s2">in a way that is analogous to religion</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.730" end="00:07:01.960" style="s2">with that is what we&#39;re looking for</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.900" end="00:07:05.750" style="s2">something they can do all of that</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.960" end="00:07:09.140" style="s2">because that is what we need that kind</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.750" end="00:07:13.340" style="s2">of transformation is needed today to</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.140" end="00:07:15.770" style="s2">address what Thomas Bjorkman calls the</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.340" end="00:07:17.690" style="s2">meta-crisis of all the various crises</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.770" end="00:07:20.720" style="s2">that we are facing and that are</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.690" end="00:07:23.260" style="s2">interacting with each other and what</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.720" end="00:07:26.810" style="s2">looks to be an increasingly accelerating</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.260" end="00:07:29.480" style="s2">fashion and having an increasingly Dilla</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.810" end="00:07:32.270" style="s2">tereus effect on us individually and</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.480" end="00:07:36.710" style="s2">collectively so that is part of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.270" end="00:07:42.520" style="s2">problem and what would it look like with</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.710" end="00:07:42.520" style="s2">the religion that is not a religion</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.330" end="00:07:50.690" style="s2">again as I said there are many people</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.960" end="00:07:56.180" style="s2">who are taking a stab at this or trying</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.690" end="00:07:57.680" style="s2">to get a grip on this and so I am just</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.180" end="00:08:00.229" style="s2">seeing myself as contributing to</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.680" end="00:08:04.580" style="s2">hopefully hopefully to that hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.229" end="00:08:07.250" style="s2">hopefully to that dialogue so part of it</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.580" end="00:08:10.700" style="s2">I think is and this is of course what I</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.250" end="00:08:20.710" style="s2">try to do is to acknowledge the</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.700" end="00:08:20.710" style="s2">centrality of religio and that there is</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.100" end="00:08:28.870" style="s2">important there&#39;s an important role for</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.070" end="00:08:32.089" style="s2">indispensible mythos and the activation</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.870" end="00:08:40.150" style="s2">accentuation acceleration appreciation</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.089" end="00:08:42.460" style="s2">of religio and so I think there that is</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.150" end="00:08:45.400" style="s2">something that should be</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.460" end="00:08:48.430" style="s2">acknowledged as what we would be looking</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.400" end="00:08:51.600" style="s2">for and and this brings out an important</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.430" end="00:08:57.070" style="s2">contrast I want to discuss so not equal</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.600" end="00:08:58.750" style="s2">religion religio versus credo let&#39;s talk</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.070" end="00:09:00.670" style="s2">about this a little bit and try and get</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.750" end="00:09:03.880" style="s2">clearer about it because we have this</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.670" end="00:09:08.200" style="s2">idea of an open-ended mythos analogous</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.880" end="00:09:12.340" style="s2">to the transgressive mythology of of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.200" end="00:09:15.760" style="s2">Gnostics so credo of course means I</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.340" end="00:09:18.010" style="s2">believe and it&#39;s it&#39;s the word behind</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.760" end="00:09:21.220" style="s2">things like the nut the Nicene Creed or</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.010" end="00:09:25.960" style="s2">the Apostolic Creed a notion of credo is</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.220" end="00:09:32.710" style="s2">a notion of sort of a paradigmatic set</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.960" end="00:09:37.480" style="s2">of propositions that who that state what</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.710" end="00:09:40.510" style="s2">the the essence of a religion is in</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.480" end="00:09:45.040" style="s2">terms of the truth content that is</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.510" end="00:09:48.690" style="s2">supposed to be believed and so what has</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.040" end="00:09:51.640" style="s2">happened to some degree in various ways</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.690" end="00:09:53.440" style="s2">and I tried to show you this is as this</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.640" end="00:09:58.120" style="s2">is of course is linked to propositional</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.440" end="00:10:02.110" style="s2">knowing and as propositional knowing has</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.120" end="00:10:06.940" style="s2">come into a ascendance right and as the</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.110" end="00:10:11.790" style="s2">having mode has come into ascendance the</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.940" end="00:10:15.570" style="s2">having of propositions that are asserted</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.790" end="00:10:19.260" style="s2">right and of course willful assertion</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.570" end="00:10:22.150" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen all of this has come in to</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.260" end="00:10:23.860" style="s2">ascension right this has tended to</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.150" end="00:10:25.810" style="s2">become dominant</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.860" end="00:10:29.350" style="s2">so as I&#39;ve mentioned we often think</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.810" end="00:10:31.600" style="s2">about religions or speak of them as if</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.350" end="00:10:34.720" style="s2">they are belief system systems of belief</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.600" end="00:10:36.700" style="s2">so right and so you have propositional</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.720" end="00:10:39.250" style="s2">knowing you have the having of those</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.700" end="00:10:42.250" style="s2">propositions and they&#39;re the way you</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.250" end="00:10:47.500" style="s2">have them is ultimately to assert them</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.250" end="00:10:48.850" style="s2">in in some fashion usually in a willful</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.500" end="00:10:50.290" style="s2">fashion where I mean that very broadly</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.850" end="00:10:52.320" style="s2">in the way that we&#39;ve discussed here</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.290" end="00:10:55.079" style="s2">where it is not something</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.320" end="00:10:57.509" style="s2">that is ultimately derived from reason</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.079" end="00:11:03.269" style="s2">but it is something that is being</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.509" end="00:11:10.519" style="s2">asserted nevertheless now I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.269" end="00:11:13.220" style="s2">there&#39;s an important role for credo and</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.519" end="00:11:19.639" style="s2">so I want to make a distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.220" end="00:11:20.790" style="s2">credo and this creedal right assertion</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.639" end="00:11:26.040" style="s2">credo</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.790" end="00:11:30.139" style="s2">dominance okay so let&#39;s talk talk about</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.040" end="00:11:30.139" style="s2">this set of things as creedal dominance</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.259" end="00:11:39.920" style="s2">but let&#39;s talk about perhaps a way of</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.360" end="00:11:44.699" style="s2">understanding the functionality of this</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.920" end="00:11:48.300" style="s2">now first of all I&#39;m of course aware of</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.699" end="00:11:50.490" style="s2">the postmodern critique and I will have</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.300" end="00:11:52.759" style="s2">a final towards the final end of this</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.490" end="00:11:57.120" style="s2">series I&#39;ll come back and talk about</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.759" end="00:12:00.209" style="s2">post-modernism but I&#39;m aware of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.120" end="00:12:02.339" style="s2">postmodern critique in the the that a</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.209" end="00:12:05.010" style="s2">lot of this is and that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.339" end="00:12:09.540" style="s2">given credo dominate dominance that this</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.010" end="00:12:14.550" style="s2">is matched with power with dominance</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.540" end="00:12:18.209" style="s2">with control with creating sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.550" end="00:12:21.569" style="s2">purity codes where we have boundaries of</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.209" end="00:12:26.550" style="s2">identity of the US and the other all of</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.569" end="00:12:29.010" style="s2">that I think III think it&#39;s a legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.550" end="00:12:31.440" style="s2">form of argument and something I take</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.010" end="00:12:32.910" style="s2">seriously but I would put that under</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.440" end="00:12:36.750" style="s2">cradle dominance and I would want to try</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.910" end="00:12:39.180" style="s2">and take out of what remains what what</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.750" end="00:12:41.279" style="s2">what function can we see for people</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.180" end="00:12:44.160" style="s2">doing this and how might we understand</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.279" end="00:12:46.589" style="s2">it well first of all like I said we can</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.160" end="00:12:48.689" style="s2">we can think of people having</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.589" end="00:12:51.449" style="s2">paradigmatic statements and pictures</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.689" end="00:12:57.329" style="s2">that this might be a function of</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.449" end="00:12:59.579" style="s2">indispensability to them right so they</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.329" end="00:13:01.260" style="s2">can understand it right we can</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.579" end="00:13:04.220" style="s2">understand it as indispensable mythos</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.260" end="00:13:04.220" style="s2">again it&#39;s highly plausible</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.130" end="00:13:11.410" style="s2">there is a mythos for you or for groups</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.829" end="00:13:14.050" style="s2">of people that is indispensable given</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.410" end="00:13:17.950" style="s2">the contextual sensitivity the dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.050" end="00:13:20.380" style="s2">coupling of religio that that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.950" end="00:13:23.890" style="s2">sets of symbols and stories and</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.380" end="00:13:27.870" style="s2">celebrations and shows and souvenirs and</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.890" end="00:13:32.200" style="s2">all the things associated with mythos</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.870" end="00:13:38.320" style="s2">right that are indispensable for getting</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.200" end="00:13:42.700" style="s2">the kind of sacredness out of religio</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.320" end="00:13:45.510" style="s2">that people want and need in response to</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.700" end="00:13:49.480" style="s2">for example the perennial problems so</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.510" end="00:13:51.490" style="s2">again this of course is part of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.480" end="00:13:53.560" style="s2">philosophical reason not just theirs</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.490" end="00:13:55.060" style="s2">also an independent moral reason but</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.560" end="00:13:58.180" style="s2">this is part of my philosophical reason</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.060" end="00:14:01.180" style="s2">why I try to be deeply respectful to</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.180" end="00:14:03.100" style="s2">religious Creed&#39;s precisely because even</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.180" end="00:14:05.440" style="s2">though I think all of these criticisms</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.100" end="00:14:07.660" style="s2">or all the criticisms associated with</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.440" end="00:14:09.820" style="s2">this criticisms that I&#39;ve all added to</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.660" end="00:14:12.699" style="s2">in this series I think they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.820" end="00:14:15.130" style="s2">legitimate I think this is also a very</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.699" end="00:14:16.860" style="s2">legitimate thing now of course the</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.130" end="00:14:18.820" style="s2">problem is is to confuse</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.860" end="00:14:21.640" style="s2">indispensability with metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.820" end="00:14:23.920" style="s2">necessity and to confuse need with</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.640" end="00:14:29.980" style="s2">authority and we&#39;ve talked about all of</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.920" end="00:14:32.440" style="s2">that what I think we can think well this</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.980" end="00:14:34.300" style="s2">is not only in indispensability that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.440" end="00:14:35.760" style="s2">idiosyncratic to people or the group we</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.300" end="00:14:38.230" style="s2">can also talk about an indispensable</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.760" end="00:14:40.420" style="s2">functionality that might be more</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.230" end="00:14:42.579" style="s2">Universal in nature and this has to do</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.420" end="00:14:44.920" style="s2">with a basic idea from all of</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.579" end="00:14:48.390" style="s2">information processing from what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.920" end="00:14:48.390" style="s2">called signal detection theory</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.780" end="00:14:58.170" style="s2">so signal detection theory is a theory</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.360" end="00:15:03.030" style="s2">that basically argues that we&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.170" end="00:15:04.590" style="s2">facing perennial problems when and I</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.030" end="00:15:06.210" style="s2">mean I mean that to allude to the</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.590" end="00:15:09.750" style="s2">perennial problems that I&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.210" end="00:15:11.610" style="s2">about here we&#39;re fate whenever we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.750" end="00:15:15.240" style="s2">doing information processing there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.610" end="00:15:17.130" style="s2">aspects in which the information is</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.240" end="00:15:18.510" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s and this is no</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.130" end="00:15:21.080" style="s2">contradiction there&#39;s simultaneously too</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.510" end="00:15:23.130" style="s2">much information but there&#39;s often</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.080" end="00:15:26.910" style="s2">inadequate information like you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.130" end="00:15:28.260" style="s2">seeing all of my body right now right so</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.910" end="00:15:31.080" style="s2">the information is simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.260" end="00:15:34.290" style="s2">overwhelming and partial the information</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.080" end="00:15:38.250" style="s2">is often ambiguous it&#39;s it&#39;s unclear if</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.290" end="00:15:42.360" style="s2">that information is the information you</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.250" end="00:15:44.220" style="s2">need or you&#39;re there you&#39;re being misled</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.360" end="00:15:45.870" style="s2">in some way by information that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.220" end="00:15:48.900" style="s2">similar but not in the relevant way to</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.870" end="00:15:51.300" style="s2">the information you&#39;re looking for so</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.900" end="00:15:53.370" style="s2">all of these things point to an</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.300" end="00:15:55.320" style="s2">important point an important general</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.370" end="00:15:57.720" style="s2">conclusion now I&#39;m gonna have to use two</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.320" end="00:16:01.130" style="s2">terms here I&#39;m gonna use the word signal</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.720" end="00:16:04.680" style="s2">and this means information I want</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.130" end="00:16:07.950" style="s2">information I want or need and then</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.680" end="00:16:09.990" style="s2">noise noise does not mean audible</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.950" end="00:16:12.390" style="s2">distortion audible distortion is one</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.990" end="00:16:20.100" style="s2">kind of it what this means is this means</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.390" end="00:16:23.820" style="s2">information I do not want right it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.100" end="00:16:28.880" style="s2">some way distracting right it&#39;s in some</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.820" end="00:16:32.160" style="s2">way misleading etc so here&#39;s the idea</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.880" end="00:16:35.790" style="s2">here&#39;s the population of events that</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.160" end="00:16:39.570" style="s2">constitute signal that you&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.790" end="00:16:43.080" style="s2">for and the idea is there&#39;s always a</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.570" end="00:16:45.240" style="s2">significant overlap with noise again</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.080" end="00:16:47.640" style="s2">where noise doesn&#39;t mean audible</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.240" end="00:16:50.820" style="s2">distortion it means any information that</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.640" end="00:16:53.670" style="s2">you don&#39;t want that it can be confused</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.820" end="00:16:56.580" style="s2">with look it confused with can be</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.670" end="00:17:00.110" style="s2">confused with signal so you let&#39;s take a</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.580" end="00:17:03.120" style="s2">prototypical example right a</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.110" end="00:17:07.490" style="s2">prototypical example is this you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.120" end="00:17:11.789" style="s2">ghazal and you hear a noise in the bush</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.490" end="00:17:14.610" style="s2">now that could be important signal it</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.789" end="00:17:16.350" style="s2">could it could be information that you</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.610" end="00:17:19.740" style="s2">want because it&#39;s information telling</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.350" end="00:17:22.289" style="s2">you that a leopard is near or the noise</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.740" end="00:17:25.380" style="s2">in the bush could be noise in this</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.289" end="00:17:27.809" style="s2">technical sense it could just be the</p>

<p begin="00:18:10.409" end="00:18:13.649" style="s2">you can say is well what I&#39;ll do is I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.029" end="00:18:15.779" style="s2">get more information and there&#39;s a sense</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.649" end="00:18:17.340" style="s2">in which that helps but you have to also</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.779" end="00:18:19.140" style="s2">understand that there&#39;s a diminishing</p>

<p begin="00:18:29.520" end="00:18:38.399" style="s2">etc okay also the more I regressed and</p>

<p begin="00:18:48.630" end="00:18:53.669" style="s2">you try to reduce it you have to put in</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.510" end="00:18:57.090" style="s2">a lot of time and effort that can</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.669" end="00:18:59.640" style="s2">ultimately be too costly for you so the</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.090" end="00:19:03.870" style="s2">idea is there&#39;s a sense in which every</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.640" end="00:19:09.419" style="s2">act even an act of perception is to some</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.870" end="00:19:13.770" style="s2">degree risky it&#39;s a gamble and this is</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.419" end="00:19:16.600" style="s2">part again and we talked about this</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.770" end="00:19:19.390" style="s2">Tim little crap Blake Richards and I in</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.600" end="00:19:22.500" style="s2">the paper on relevance realization this</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.390" end="00:19:26.340" style="s2">is this is part again of the issue of</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.500" end="00:19:29.559" style="s2">you know trading off between various</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.340" end="00:19:31.900" style="s2">contingencies what&#39;s the trade-off here</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.559" end="00:19:33.820" style="s2">well that&#39;s right the trade-off is I</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.900" end="00:19:36.340" style="s2">have to I have to what&#39;s called do I</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.820" end="00:19:40.140" style="s2">have to set the criterion so the</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.340" end="00:19:43.090" style="s2">criterion is basically what I do is I</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.140" end="00:19:46.240" style="s2">put a dividing line a decision line</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.090" end="00:19:50.110" style="s2">remember decide ultimately means to cut</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.240" end="00:19:53.650" style="s2">and I&#39;m gonna include everything right</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.110" end="00:19:57.159" style="s2">to the left that signal and exclude</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.650" end="00:19:59.440" style="s2">everything to the right now what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.159" end="00:20:05.200" style="s2">what&#39;s the problem with that well the</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.440" end="00:20:08.440" style="s2">problem with that is of course I&#39;m now</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.200" end="00:20:13.539" style="s2">opening myself up to different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.440" end="00:20:16.900" style="s2">errors okay so one of the things I can</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.539" end="00:20:20.470" style="s2">do here is I kept my criterion too high</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.900" end="00:20:26.200" style="s2">for example I will include a lot I will</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.470" end="00:20:28.030" style="s2">treat a lot of noise as signal okay if I</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.200" end="00:20:30.100" style="s2">set my criteria and way down here I I</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.030" end="00:20:35.130" style="s2">don&#39;t want to ever be wrong I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.100" end="00:20:37.630" style="s2">set my criterion really low right here</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.130" end="00:20:39.850" style="s2">all right I&#39;m gonna set my that way I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.630" end="00:20:42.130" style="s2">never the problem is if I set my</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.850" end="00:20:46.330" style="s2">criterion so I exclude all possible</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.130" end="00:20:50.130" style="s2">noise I&#39;m gonna miss a lot of valuable</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.330" end="00:20:53.260" style="s2">signal okay</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.130" end="00:20:55.299" style="s2">the other issue that comes up so where</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.260" end="00:20:57.990" style="s2">do you set the criterion well I mean</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.299" end="00:21:00.669" style="s2">there isn&#39;t an algorithm for that</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.990" end="00:21:03.150" style="s2">because part of the problem is those</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.669" end="00:21:06.669" style="s2">different kinds of errors are</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.150" end="00:21:08.110" style="s2">differentially relevant to you depending</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.669" end="00:21:12.520" style="s2">on the context let&#39;s go back to the</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.110" end="00:21:15.220" style="s2">gazelle you have two gazelles you have</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.520" end="00:21:19.600" style="s2">build a happy gazelle and what Bill</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.220" end="00:21:21.990" style="s2">wants to do is basically write once to</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.600" end="00:21:21.990" style="s2">avoid</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.760" end="00:21:31.970" style="s2">leopards right so bill says well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.030" end="00:21:36.320" style="s2">gonna set my criterion very high because</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.970" end="00:21:38.840" style="s2">that way most of the time I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.320" end="00:21:41.600" style="s2">treat the noise as a leopard in the bush</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.840" end="00:21:44.330" style="s2">and that way my chances of missing a</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.600" end="00:21:48.050" style="s2">leopard were very small now the problem</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.330" end="00:21:51.620" style="s2">with Bill is he&#39;s kind of you know he</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.050" end="00:21:53.210" style="s2">runs away a lot lot there&#39;s every wind</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.620" end="00:21:55.430" style="s2">and he runs away and all the other</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.210" end="00:21:57.080" style="s2">gazelles laugh at Bill look at Bill he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.430" end="00:21:58.700" style="s2">running around again and if bill does</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.080" end="00:22:03.320" style="s2">this too much of course it&#39;s exhausting</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.700" end="00:22:08.950" style="s2">right now in contrast to build the</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.320" end="00:22:13.160" style="s2">gazelle there is you know let&#39;s call it</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.950" end="00:22:16.070" style="s2">Tom and Tommy is the you know the really</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.160" end="00:22:18.800" style="s2">epistemic ly oriented gazelle tom will</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.070" end="00:22:21.380" style="s2">only act on the basis of what tom truly</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.800" end="00:22:24.050" style="s2">believes and so tom is gonna be very</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.380" end="00:22:26.360" style="s2">skeptical and set their criterion very</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.050" end="00:22:28.940" style="s2">low and tom says I&#39;m only going to</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.360" end="00:22:31.820" style="s2">believe what I am really confident in</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.940" end="00:22:34.700" style="s2">and certain of right and that way you</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.820" end="00:22:36.620" style="s2">know this is what&#39;s gonna happen so what</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.700" end="00:22:39.830" style="s2">what happens for tom is all the</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.620" end="00:22:42.620" style="s2">instances where the wind is blowing and</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.830" end="00:22:45.520" style="s2">bill runs away Tom laughs Abdullah aha</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.620" end="00:22:51.770" style="s2">aha silly bill</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.520" end="00:22:54.350" style="s2">the problem is tom is missing signal by</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.770" end="00:22:57.980" style="s2">setting his criterion so low and one of</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.350" end="00:23:01.820" style="s2">these times there&#39;s a noise in the bush</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.980" end="00:23:04.310" style="s2">bill runs Tom begins to laugh and as</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.820" end="00:23:09.350" style="s2">he&#39;s mid laughs there is a leopard on</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.310" end="00:23:15.410" style="s2">his back sinking its jaws in a death</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.350" end="00:23:20.090" style="s2">grip on his neck because you see in this</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.410" end="00:23:24.430" style="s2">in this context not in all contexts not</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.090" end="00:23:28.570" style="s2">in all contexts but in this context</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.430" end="00:23:31.130" style="s2">missing signal is much worse than</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.570" end="00:23:35.690" style="s2">mistaking noise for signal see there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.130" end="00:23:42.740" style="s2">two kinds of errors I can miss signal</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.690" end="00:23:47.210" style="s2">I can mistake noise for signal when I do</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.740" end="00:23:49.490" style="s2">this right that&#39;s bill everybody laughs</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.210" end="00:23:53.960" style="s2">at me that&#39;s a cost and I&#39;m using a lot</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.490" end="00:23:57.050" style="s2">of energy but if I miss right if I miss</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.960" end="00:23:59.690" style="s2">the leopard I&#39;m dead and that&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.050" end="00:24:02.390" style="s2">much worse so that&#39;s why most gazelles</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.690" end="00:24:05.770" style="s2">are like Bill rather than like Tom they</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.390" end="00:24:09.170" style="s2">set the criteria and way over here</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.770" end="00:24:13.280" style="s2">they&#39;re willing to make a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.170" end="00:24:16.960" style="s2">mistakes so that they do not make very</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.280" end="00:24:20.630" style="s2">many misses now there&#39;s other situations</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.960" end="00:24:24.050" style="s2">where you write whether to bill reversed</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.630" end="00:24:27.500" style="s2">where a mistake is much more costly to</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.050" end="00:24:36.820" style="s2">you than a miss and so what you need</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.500" end="00:24:41.510" style="s2">right what you need is you need to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.820" end="00:24:44.300" style="s2">flexibly setting your criterion in a way</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.510" end="00:24:47.630" style="s2">that is deeply contextually sensitive</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.300" end="00:24:51.220" style="s2">deeply situationally aware this is again</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.630" end="00:24:54.740" style="s2">why perspectival knowing is so crucial</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.220" end="00:24:56.810" style="s2">perspectival knowing is your situational</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.740" end="00:25:00.410" style="s2">awareness and your situational awareness</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.810" end="00:25:03.590" style="s2">should be right your primary guide to</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.410" end="00:25:05.870" style="s2">what is the context and how do I set the</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.590" end="00:25:08.750" style="s2">criterion in this context in fact</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.870" end="00:25:10.580" style="s2">there&#39;s a neuroscientist cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.750" end="00:25:13.700" style="s2">scientist Lao who argues that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.580" end="00:25:17.780" style="s2">functions of consciousness is exactly to</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.700" end="00:25:21.730" style="s2">set the criterion for a for perception</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.780" end="00:25:27.590" style="s2">so what you&#39;re paying attention to right</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.730" end="00:25:29.630" style="s2">is how your situationally aware and so</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.590" end="00:25:31.760" style="s2">how you&#39;re paying attention how your</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.630" end="00:25:35.740" style="s2">situationally aware how you&#39;re setting</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.760" end="00:25:39.380" style="s2">the the criterion is actually the job of</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.740" end="00:25:42.980" style="s2">consciousness now as as you may realize</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.380" end="00:25:44.780" style="s2">and myself and Richard wu and anderson</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.980" end="00:25:47.270" style="s2">todd argued this again is another</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.780" end="00:25:49.010" style="s2">argument that one of the main functions</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.270" end="00:25:50.660" style="s2">of consciousness is</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.010" end="00:25:52.760" style="s2">to do relevance realization within</p>

<p begin="00:26:01.400" end="00:26:05.510" style="s2">to be remembered what does this have to</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.020" end="00:26:10.400" style="s2">do with credo well I would argue that</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.510" end="00:26:15.590" style="s2">what credo is is criteria is setting the</p>

<p begin="00:26:35.150" end="00:26:44.540" style="s2">issue is we have to set the criteria</p>

<p begin="00:26:44.540" end="00:26:52.150" style="s2">this is to do it in an absolutist way</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.220" end="00:26:57.050" style="s2">one way to do this is to say there is a</p>

<p begin="00:26:57.050" end="00:27:03.110" style="s2">place to set the criterion I can think I</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.310" end="00:27:05.600" style="s2">think you can see from the argument</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.110" end="00:27:08.350" style="s2">given here why that is a perilous thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.600" end="00:27:10.790" style="s2">to do you can see again why the</p>

<p begin="00:27:10.790" end="00:27:15.590" style="s2">undermines these the attempt to</p>

<p begin="00:27:15.590" end="00:27:20.570" style="s2">to set the criterion but it is dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.410" end="00:27:26.630" style="s2">to set the criterion in an absolute</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.570" end="00:27:29.630" style="s2">fashion so if we can acknowledge this we</p>

<p begin="00:27:29.630" end="00:27:38.990" style="s2">criterion with our mythos but and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.080" end="00:27:41.720" style="s2">one half of credo but we should not ever</p>

<p begin="00:28:13.350" end="00:28:20.070" style="s2">thinking about that is the religion of</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.750" end="00:28:23.550" style="s2">not that&#39;s not a religion would always</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.070" end="00:28:27.510" style="s2">always have credo in the service of</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.550" end="00:28:29.520" style="s2">religio now I&#39;m sure that there are many</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.510" end="00:28:31.470" style="s2">religious people would say well that is</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.520" end="00:28:32.970" style="s2">that is what we do in practice and you</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.470" end="00:28:34.670" style="s2">know we have our Creed&#39;s but they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:28:34.670" end="00:28:41.370" style="s2">interpreted be right and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.700" end="00:28:44.580" style="s2">sort of right in practice but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.370" end="00:28:49.260" style="s2">often been a lot of conflict between de</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.580" end="00:28:51.510" style="s2">facto and de jure in the history of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.260" end="00:28:54.330" style="s2">religious discussions around orthodoxy</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.510" end="00:28:57.950" style="s2">and Creed etc and I point to you again</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.330" end="00:29:02.700" style="s2">to the work of Arthur Lewis and his work</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.950" end="00:29:06.180" style="s2">on the way in which the the the West</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.700" end="00:29:10.110" style="s2">history of pursuing and persecuting</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.180" end="00:29:13.470" style="s2">heretics people who write do not set the</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.110" end="00:29:16.860" style="s2">criterion as we do has actually helped</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.470" end="00:29:21.990" style="s2">to foreshadow and train the West for</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.860" end="00:29:24.990" style="s2">totalitarian regimes and città latarian</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.990" end="00:29:27.930" style="s2">ideologies so all I point you again to</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.990" end="00:29:31.710" style="s2">his historical argument for how that</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.930" end="00:29:36.560" style="s2">came about so for that reason we should</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.710" end="00:29:36.560" style="s2">always be thinking of making credo</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.830" end="00:29:47.130" style="s2">clearly and comprehensively always in</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.120" end="00:29:51.750" style="s2">the service of religio that would be</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.130" end="00:29:54.150" style="s2">helped as you can I think see by being</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.750" end="00:29:57.470" style="s2">linked to a notion of sacredness as</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.150" end="00:30:03.270" style="s2">being grounded in an inexhaustible</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.470" end="00:30:08.100" style="s2">open-ended Optima optimization rather</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.270" end="00:30:10.640" style="s2">than in some absolute state of</p>

<p begin="00:30:11.520" end="00:30:23.080" style="s2">next I think that the religion that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.920" end="00:30:25.930" style="s2">not our religion should when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.080" end="00:30:27.820" style="s2">crafting its mythos and understanding</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.930" end="00:30:31.750" style="s2">that credo is always in the service of</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.820" end="00:30:34.960" style="s2">religio it should always understand the</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.750" end="00:30:36.730" style="s2">mythos as being beholden to sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.960" end="00:30:39.520" style="s2">three levels that we&#39;ve been talking</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.730" end="00:30:45.340" style="s2">about here so you have the unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.520" end="00:30:49.630" style="s2">level right mm this is the level at</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.340" end="00:30:52.690" style="s2">which relevance realization is taking</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.630" end="00:30:55.030" style="s2">place right most of the relevance</p>

<p begin="00:30:55.030" end="00:31:00.910" style="s2">not have introspective access to in any</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.250" end="00:31:06.070" style="s2">way and this of course is the grounding</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.910" end="00:31:07.780" style="s2">of my participatory knowing of course</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.070" end="00:31:09.880" style="s2">you become you can become conscious of</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.780" end="00:31:11.590" style="s2">your participation but that&#39;s some what</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.880" end="00:31:15.130" style="s2">I&#39;m saying here I&#39;m saying that the</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.590" end="00:31:18.930" style="s2">processes by which from which I emerge</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.130" end="00:31:24.640" style="s2">as an autobiographical ego and the world</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.930" end="00:31:27.400" style="s2">emerges as an unfolding arena right or</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.640" end="00:31:28.450" style="s2">ultimately below the level of</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.400" end="00:31:31.120" style="s2">consciousness and that&#39;s where the</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.450" end="00:31:35.760" style="s2">participatory knowing is happening and</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.120" end="00:31:35.760" style="s2">then of course there is the level of</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.780" end="00:31:43.620" style="s2">consciousness and this is the level of</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.850" end="00:31:46.620" style="s2">salience</p>

<p begin="00:31:47.650" end="00:31:53.890" style="s2">and of course this is the level of</p>

<p begin="00:31:53.890" end="00:31:59.830" style="s2">Duyvil knowing is grounded in the</p>

<p begin="00:32:03.610" end="00:32:11.280" style="s2">makes possible the procedural knowing</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.590" end="00:32:15.940" style="s2">these are tightly intermeshed as well</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.280" end="00:32:20.010" style="s2">this is where I am right consciously</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.940" end="00:32:22.870" style="s2">directing my interactions in order to</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.010" end="00:32:24.760" style="s2">appropriate affordances given to me at</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.870" end="00:32:26.980" style="s2">this level and I&#39;m appropriating those</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.760" end="00:32:29.850" style="s2">affordances by cultivating skills so</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.980" end="00:32:33.480" style="s2">that my coping turns into skillful</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.850" end="00:32:38.130" style="s2">interaction my coping caring becomes</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.480" end="00:32:41.650" style="s2">skillful action and apt Sensibility and</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.130" end="00:32:46.600" style="s2">then of course this passes into the</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.650" end="00:32:49.380" style="s2">cultural level this is the level of</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.600" end="00:32:49.380" style="s2">distributed cognition</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.660" end="00:33:01.580" style="s2">and this is the level at which we are</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.120" end="00:33:03.080" style="s2">trying to write communicate so this is</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.580" end="00:33:05.929" style="s2">this is this is level of which</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.080" end="00:33:07.370" style="s2">connections are being made this is the</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.929" end="00:33:11.360" style="s2">level at which connections are being</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.370" end="00:33:12.830" style="s2">sensed and internalized and then this is</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.360" end="00:33:16.730" style="s2">the level of which connections are being</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.830" end="00:33:20.240" style="s2">shared and so what we have here of</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.730" end="00:33:25.419" style="s2">course is the whole machinery of mythos</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.240" end="00:33:28.760" style="s2">and of course the machinery of science</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.419" end="00:33:30.860" style="s2">and other things such as that but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.760" end="00:33:33.380" style="s2">gonna although that&#39;s at the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.860" end="00:33:35.230" style="s2">level and taking it out because what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.380" end="00:33:42.799" style="s2">going to concentrate on here is</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.230" end="00:33:46.070" style="s2">addressing this so as I said this will</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.799" end="00:33:49.480" style="s2">pick up on our propositional knowing but</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.070" end="00:33:57.169" style="s2">of course the mythos also points down</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.480" end="00:34:04.150" style="s2">towards right all of these because here</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.169" end="00:34:04.150" style="s2">we have credo in the service of religio</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.520" end="00:34:14.419" style="s2">and so any mythos is going to understand</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.600" end="00:34:17.330" style="s2">itself this way if I put it horizontally</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.419" end="00:34:19.790" style="s2">as always in the service of religio</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.330" end="00:34:23.270" style="s2">which means it is always going to also</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.790" end="00:34:25.850" style="s2">be directed you&#39;ll allow me downwards</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.270" end="00:34:27.530" style="s2">right to the procedural knowing the</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.850" end="00:34:33.700" style="s2">respect travel knowing and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.530" end="00:34:40.030" style="s2">participatory knowing so it should be a</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.700" end="00:34:42.619" style="s2">mythos that is explicitly committed to</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.030" end="00:34:45.639" style="s2">both of those in an integrated fashion</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.619" end="00:34:48.169" style="s2">that the credo the paradigmatic</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.639" end="00:34:53.330" style="s2">propositions the paradigmatic pictures</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.169" end="00:34:56.090" style="s2">right are always in the service of</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.330" end="00:35:02.830" style="s2">religio and that the mythos therefore is</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.090" end="00:35:05.780" style="s2">directed towards accessing activating</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.830" end="00:35:07.220" style="s2">accentuating right appreciating the</p>

<p begin="00:35:45.260" end="00:35:56.110" style="s2">what it should be doing is cultivating</p>

<p begin="00:36:29.790" end="00:36:34.920" style="s2">I tried to indicate to you what that</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.400" end="00:36:37.560" style="s2">ecology should look like you should be</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.920" end="00:36:40.550" style="s2">setting up psycho technologies sets of</p>

<p begin="00:37:00.600" end="00:37:05.670" style="s2">means we need to do something very</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.490" end="00:37:08.010" style="s2">important and this is an idea that</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.670" end="00:37:11.670" style="s2">emerged in a discussion with Jordan Hall</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.010" end="00:37:13.440" style="s2">and he put it this way I think which is</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.670" end="00:37:19.110" style="s2">a very interesting way of putting it we</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.440" end="00:37:22.890" style="s2">need a meta cyclic technology that is</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.110" end="00:37:24.720" style="s2">designed to give us move us out of the</p>

<p begin="00:37:24.720" end="00:37:29.940" style="s2">technologies into the more explicit so</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.380" end="00:37:32.060" style="s2">two points here they&#39;re more explicit</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.940" end="00:37:35.820" style="s2">creation of cyclic technologies and</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.060" end="00:37:39.690" style="s2">explicitly the task of trying to</p>

<p begin="00:37:39.690" end="00:37:44.550" style="s2">engineered psycho technologies so this</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.970" end="00:37:46.650" style="s2">would be the meta psycho technology so</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.550" end="00:37:53.780" style="s2">this religion that is not a religion</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.650" end="00:37:56.460" style="s2">should give people ways of cultivating</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.780" end="00:38:00.660" style="s2">this Metis I call this meta psycho</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.460" end="00:38:04.830" style="s2">technology as a way of crafting the</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.660" end="00:38:07.590" style="s2">ecology of practices for addressing the</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.830" end="00:38:10.369" style="s2">perennial problems in a way that is</p>

<p begin="00:38:13.339" end="00:38:22.160" style="s2">attunement I think that there are deep</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.829" end="00:38:24.469" style="s2">connections between the capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.160" end="00:38:26.809" style="s2">collectively creating the Metis and you</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.469" end="00:38:28.160" style="s2">have to do this collectively because</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.809" end="00:38:31.699" style="s2">that&#39;s how selective technologies are</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.160" end="00:38:35.380" style="s2">created right the capacity for creating</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.699" end="00:38:38.660" style="s2">this collectively and the individual</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.380" end="00:38:40.939" style="s2">virtue meta virtue because that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.660" end="00:38:42.410" style="s2">it is the meta virtue of wisdom there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.939" end="00:38:44.619" style="s2">deep connections for that the more the</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.410" end="00:38:46.880" style="s2">people are individually cultivating</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.619" end="00:38:48.499" style="s2">because wisdom is basically a way of</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.880" end="00:38:49.969" style="s2">cultivating and coordinating the</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.499" end="00:38:52.759" style="s2">individual virtues we&#39;ll come back to</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.969" end="00:38:54.799" style="s2">that so you need individual wisdom the</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.759" end="00:38:58.279" style="s2">meta virtue in order to collectively</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.799" end="00:39:00.890" style="s2">right pursue the creation and the cult</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.279" end="00:39:03.619" style="s2">the ongoing cultivation of them the meta</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.890" end="00:39:07.039" style="s2">psycho technology that will allow us to</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.619" end="00:39:11.089" style="s2">engineer individual psycho technologies</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.039" end="00:39:14.119" style="s2">and to cultivate a ecology of psycho</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.089" end="00:39:16.910" style="s2">tech that reaches right comprehensively</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.119" end="00:39:19.339" style="s2">down to our participatory knowing and</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.910" end="00:39:23.949" style="s2">affords comprehensively the emergence up</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.339" end="00:39:23.949" style="s2">from our participatory knowing</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.700" end="00:39:37.150" style="s2">so I think those are some very general</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.349" end="00:39:40.390" style="s2">structural features some things we might</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.150" end="00:39:46.589" style="s2">be wanting to do a more organizational</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.390" end="00:39:50.039" style="s2">level is and this is extremely tentative</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.589" end="00:39:53.710" style="s2">extremely so what might it be to create</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.039" end="00:39:57.579" style="s2">that open-ended credo well we have</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.710" end="00:40:00.759" style="s2">something like that already because of</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.579" end="00:40:02.319" style="s2">the emergence of the cyber technologies</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.759" end="00:40:06.910" style="s2">that are being increasingly integrated</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.319" end="00:40:09.039" style="s2">with the psycho technologies and it and</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.910" end="00:40:12.579" style="s2">I&#39;m using this just as an analogy but we</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.039" end="00:40:15.220" style="s2">have something like Wikipedia and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.579" end="00:40:16.630" style="s2">interesting about the Wikipedia is is</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.220" end="00:40:18.400" style="s2">the way it&#39;s generated the way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.630" end="00:40:20.890" style="s2">maintained the way it&#39;s revised it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.400" end="00:40:29.789" style="s2">done in this collective cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.890" end="00:40:32.619" style="s2">fashion and it has both a quite you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.789" end="00:40:39.670" style="s2">reliable stability but also a quite</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.619" end="00:40:47.109" style="s2">reliable evolved evolution and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.670" end="00:40:54.130" style="s2">interesting is I&#39;ve recently expose any</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.109" end="00:40:58.630" style="s2">oath created something like this from</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.130" end="00:41:00.009" style="s2">one of my courses and in the what we did</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.630" end="00:41:02.769" style="s2">there in one of the courses at the</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.009" end="00:41:05.589" style="s2">University it&#39;s got former students to</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.769" end="00:41:08.650" style="s2">grace basically create a wiki of some of</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.589" end="00:41:11.500" style="s2">the main ideas main themes main</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.650" end="00:41:13.210" style="s2">arguments in the course and and what</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.500" end="00:41:15.849" style="s2">happens is people of course get much</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.210" end="00:41:18.400" style="s2">more involved in a participatory fashion</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.849" end="00:41:22.150" style="s2">with the generation of sort of the credo</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.400" end="00:41:25.029" style="s2">for the course and on what they also do</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.150" end="00:41:28.779" style="s2">is write is they create something like</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.029" end="00:41:32.559" style="s2">the Wikipedia that gives people much</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.779" end="00:41:36.119" style="s2">more interactional and evolving content</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.559" end="00:41:38.650" style="s2">to work with so you get sort of this</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.119" end="00:41:39.099" style="s2">presentation of what&#39;s paradigmatic and</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.650" end="00:41:43.869" style="s2">pro</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.099" end="00:41:49.269" style="s2">typical for the course but in this</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.869" end="00:41:54.579" style="s2">collective a dynamic and ongoing fashion</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.269" end="00:41:59.019" style="s2">so perhaps we could think about creating</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.579" end="00:42:02.920" style="s2">a credo analogous to that where we</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.019" end="00:42:06.849" style="s2">create something like a wiki a credo</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.920" end="00:42:10.259" style="s2">wiki for example by which groups of</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.849" end="00:42:13.479" style="s2">people that are interested in creating</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.259" end="00:42:16.119" style="s2">Ecology&#39;s of practices and cycler</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.479" end="00:42:19.059" style="s2">technologies can communicate with each</p>

<p begin="00:42:27.910" end="00:42:34.779" style="s2">like the meta psycho technology that</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.210" end="00:42:38.109" style="s2">will help to guarantee maybe that too</p>

<p begin="00:42:38.109" end="00:42:43.349" style="s2">promote both the bottom-up and top-down</p>

<p begin="00:42:47.410" end="00:42:59.799" style="s2">technology maybe that could be set in</p>

<p begin="00:45:46.230" end="00:45:58.110" style="s2">there are sets of practices that we can</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.750" end="00:46:01.620" style="s2">cultivate as an ecology for addressing</p>

<p begin="00:46:23.990" end="00:46:29.910" style="s2">within the project of trying to bring</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.110" end="00:46:41.190" style="s2">about the religion that is not a</p>

<p begin="00:46:52.310" end="00:46:58.470" style="s2">this is ultimately going to come back to</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.130" end="00:47:00.690" style="s2">the dialogue that I&#39;m going to set up</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.470" end="00:47:04.380" style="s2">between what I&#39;ve argued for here and</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.690" end="00:47:06.690" style="s2">some of the other prophets of this</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.380" end="00:47:11.970" style="s2">religion beyond a religion that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.690" end="00:47:15.269" style="s2">religion like Tillich Jung I would argue</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.970" end="00:47:19.170" style="s2">also Corbin and perhaps aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.269" end="00:47:22.460" style="s2">Barfield and the The Godfather of all of</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.170" end="00:47:27.569" style="s2">that of course is are people like</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.460" end="00:47:29.359" style="s2">Heidegger so that&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.569" end="00:47:32.279" style="s2">something we&#39;re going to come back to</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.359" end="00:47:33.990" style="s2">but we need to do something else now</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.279" end="00:47:37.049" style="s2">that I&#39;ve constantly been putting aside</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.990" end="00:47:39.450" style="s2">because it also is going to be involved</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.049" end="00:47:42.299" style="s2">in the process that I have been</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.450" end="00:47:45.000" style="s2">proposing to you and we&#39;ve said it</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.299" end="00:47:47.369" style="s2">throughout which is their cultivation of</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.000" end="00:47:50.130" style="s2">wisdom and as we&#39;ve seen the cultivation</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.369" end="00:47:56.059" style="s2">of wisdom as a meta virtue is deeply</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.130" end="00:47:58.740" style="s2">resonant with right the communitas</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.059" end="00:48:01.650" style="s2">cultivation of the meta psychology that</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.740" end="00:48:05.819" style="s2">is needed for the ecology of ciclo</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.650" end="00:48:09.750" style="s2">technology and of course wisdom is also</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.819" end="00:48:15.710" style="s2">needed for the project of i´ve</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.750" end="00:48:19.349" style="s2">enlightenment I&#39;ve already mentioned and</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.710" end="00:48:21.440" style="s2">finally wisdom has always been</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.349" end="00:48:26.329" style="s2">associated since the axial revolution</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.440" end="00:48:29.250" style="s2">with satisfying those deep connectedness</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.329" end="00:48:30.509" style="s2">the connectedness to one&#39;s self the</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.250" end="00:48:33.569" style="s2">connectedness to the world the</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.509" end="00:48:36.539" style="s2">connectedness to others that makes for a</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.569" end="00:48:38.930" style="s2">meaningful life so I want to start</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.539" end="00:48:47.460" style="s2">talking now about the cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.930" end="00:48:51.299" style="s2">of wisdom and I want to and again this</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.460" end="00:48:53.759" style="s2">is this is a very exciting and hot area</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.299" end="00:48:54.960" style="s2">in in cognizant there&#39;s lots going on</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.759" end="00:48:58.950" style="s2">about this right now</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.960" end="00:49:02.160" style="s2">and it&#39;s becoming very very pervasive</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.950" end="00:49:03.990" style="s2">and the discussion of wisdom &#39;men the</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.160" end="00:49:09.029" style="s2">culture at large is coming to the fore</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.990" end="00:49:10.259" style="s2">again so I can&#39;t I mean I would like to</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.029" end="00:49:13.559" style="s2">have a series at some point that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.259" end="00:49:15.900" style="s2">on wisdom I can&#39;t do that right now what</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.559" end="00:49:22.559" style="s2">I want to do is try and give again sort</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.900" end="00:49:25.170" style="s2">of a very quick overview of sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.559" end="00:49:26.460" style="s2">key players if you&#39;ll allow serious</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.170" end="00:49:30.000" style="s2">players</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.460" end="00:49:33.119" style="s2">in the cognitive science of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.000" end="00:49:36.540" style="s2">business and what we can glean from that</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.119" end="00:49:37.860" style="s2">and how we can integrate it into the</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.540" end="00:49:42.960" style="s2">model and picture we&#39;ve been building</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.860" end="00:49:45.990" style="s2">here so this really took off in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.960" end="00:49:48.030" style="s2">1990s with an anthology by Robert</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.990" end="00:49:49.970" style="s2">Sternberg Sternberg the psychologist</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.030" end="00:49:53.520" style="s2">Robert Sternberg has done a tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.970" end="00:49:55.440" style="s2">amount of work to bring back the notion</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.520" end="00:49:57.119" style="s2">of wisdom within psychology within</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.440" end="00:49:59.040" style="s2">cognitive science in general within and</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.119" end="00:50:03.680" style="s2">even within pedagogy and the</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.040" end="00:50:08.630" style="s2">understanding of Education and that</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.680" end="00:50:11.580" style="s2">anthology really started to bring out</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.630" end="00:50:13.980" style="s2">some of the initial work that was being</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.580" end="00:50:16.710" style="s2">done the seminal work and also promote a</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.980" end="00:50:21.930" style="s2">lot of work that has expanded since on</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.710" end="00:50:26.340" style="s2">this I want to talk about work that was</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.930" end="00:50:28.710" style="s2">happening at around the same time as</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.340" end="00:50:31.770" style="s2">this shortly thereafter</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.710" end="00:50:33.630" style="s2">so the Sternberg the first Sternberg</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.770" end="00:50:36.510" style="s2">anthology on wisdom there&#39;s been another</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.630" end="00:50:40.230" style="s2">one since the wisdom handbook was in</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.510" end="00:50:45.180" style="s2">1990 and then Minh siddur a really</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.230" end="00:50:51.150" style="s2">important article came out in 1999 by</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.180" end="00:50:53.550" style="s2">the Ian barber it was important because</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.150" end="00:50:55.830" style="s2">it was basically retrospective</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.550" end="00:50:58.800" style="s2">reflection on sort of the first decade</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.830" end="00:51:00.810" style="s2">of work on wisdom but it was doing</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.800" end="00:51:03.300" style="s2">something more than that so it was it</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.810" end="00:51:05.490" style="s2">was definitely doing that retrospective</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.300" end="00:51:09.510" style="s2">but it was also doing something very</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.490" end="00:51:12.600" style="s2">important something that is is so</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.510" end="00:51:15.000" style="s2">resonant with what we&#39;ve been doing here</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.600" end="00:51:17.970" style="s2">together because what they wanted to do</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.000" end="00:51:20.850" style="s2">was they wanted to try and link two</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.970" end="00:51:24.090" style="s2">things together in a very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.850" end="00:51:29.119" style="s2">convergence argument they wanted to look</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.090" end="00:51:32.010" style="s2">at all of what they call the a priori</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.119" end="00:51:34.500" style="s2">theories of wisdom our way of</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.010" end="00:51:36.450" style="s2">understanding that I think is very easy</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.500" end="00:51:37.890" style="s2">just by seeing what they looked at they</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.450" end="00:51:39.120" style="s2">wanted to look at all the philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.890" end="00:51:41.250" style="s2">theories and we&#39;ve look</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.120" end="00:51:42.390" style="s2">that quite a few of them so we&#39;re we</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.250" end="00:51:42.930" style="s2">have an understanding of what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.390" end="00:51:45.270" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.930" end="00:51:48.060" style="s2">we saw the Socratic theory and the</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.270" end="00:51:49.710" style="s2">Aristotelian and the stoic right and the</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.060" end="00:51:51.600" style="s2">platonic so you have the philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.710" end="00:51:54.030" style="s2">theories of wisdom and of course that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.600" end="00:51:56.400" style="s2">appropriate because philosophy is the</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.030" end="00:52:01.290" style="s2">love of wisdom but they also wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.400" end="00:52:03.090" style="s2">look at right and there then about 15</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.290" end="00:52:05.820" style="s2">years because the anthology comes out in</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.090" end="00:52:07.950" style="s2">1990 some work had been going on in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.820" end="00:52:10.260" style="s2">80s and then it starts to really take</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.950" end="00:52:17.550" style="s2">off but but you&#39;ve got the psychological</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.260" end="00:52:19.530" style="s2">theories right now these are very</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.550" end="00:52:21.690" style="s2">conceptually driven they&#39;re very sort of</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.530" end="00:52:24.630" style="s2">top-down these of course are much more</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.690" end="00:52:26.490" style="s2">empirically driven bottom-up and what</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.630" end="00:52:29.700" style="s2">they were trying to do was they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.490" end="00:52:33.630" style="s2">trying to set up basically a reflective</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.700" end="00:52:39.620" style="s2">equilibrium between them they&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.630" end="00:52:44.280" style="s2">to find they&#39;re trying to find through a</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.620" end="00:52:47.460" style="s2">coordinated investigation a convergent</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.280" end="00:52:49.740" style="s2">theme both from all of the philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.460" end="00:52:52.050" style="s2">work and all of the psychological works</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.740" end="00:52:55.590" style="s2">so looking at all of the philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.050" end="00:52:58.560" style="s2">work what does it converge on same thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.590" end="00:53:04.320" style="s2">with the psychological work and then can</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.560" end="00:53:09.540" style="s2">we draw it all together in a you know in</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.320" end="00:53:10.950" style="s2">a reflectively coherent fashion and they</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.540" end="00:53:14.430" style="s2">did they make a very powerful argument</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.950" end="00:53:17.990" style="s2">they go through and they make an</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.430" end="00:53:26.610" style="s2">argument that what all of these theories</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.990" end="00:53:28.620" style="s2">converge on is seeing through illusion</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.610" end="00:53:31.710" style="s2">that the core of wisdom is the ability</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.620" end="00:53:34.560" style="s2">to see through illusion where this means</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.710" end="00:53:37.110" style="s2">of course much more broadly they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.560" end="00:53:41.720" style="s2">meaning primarily here visual illusion</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.110" end="00:53:43.920" style="s2">they&#39;re meaning right cognitive and</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.720" end="00:53:46.380" style="s2">existential illusion that is caused by</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.920" end="00:53:48.860" style="s2">self-deception so seeing through this</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.380" end="00:53:52.220" style="s2">and they end and of course because</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.860" end="00:53:54.349" style="s2">wisdom is a systemic notion</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.220" end="00:53:57.670" style="s2">and this is something they are going to</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.349" end="00:54:01.550" style="s2">explicitly argue about this is</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.670" end="00:54:04.190" style="s2">systematically right so not just this</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.550" end="00:54:06.190" style="s2">elysian or this self-deception but a</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.190" end="00:54:09.260" style="s2">systematic seen through of</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.190" end="00:54:13.880" style="s2">self-deception and then and something</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.260" end="00:54:16.310" style="s2">that Leo and I published in Leo Farrar</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.880" end="00:54:18.740" style="s2">on unpublished in 2013 we argued that</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.310" end="00:54:20.450" style="s2">this of course has a strong implication</p>

<p begin="00:55:10.880" end="00:55:16.790" style="s2">systemic insight that we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.540" end="00:55:19.099" style="s2">when we talked about higher states of</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.790" end="00:55:21.440" style="s2">consciousness and and we&#39;ll see that</p>

<p begin="00:55:35.990" end="00:55:40.790" style="s2">you can come up with an insight that</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.390" end="00:55:43.579" style="s2">intervenes not just on this problem but</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.790" end="00:55:46.190" style="s2">in all of these problems in a systematic</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.579" end="00:55:49.810" style="s2">fashion and thereby you start to see</p>
