<p begin="00:00:03.600" end="00:00:06.480" style="s2">compensation plan for the last couple of</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.520" end="00:00:09.360" style="s2">weeks</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.480" end="00:00:10.240" style="s2">and i have been told that it&#39;s super</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.360" end="00:00:13.759" style="s2">easy</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.240" end="00:00:16.320" style="s2">if you just keep at it to earn 32 000</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.759" end="00:00:17.600" style="s2">per month all you have to do is have</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.320" end="00:00:18.800" style="s2">three friends sign up through friends</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.600" end="00:00:20.160" style="s2">who sign up three friends right the</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.800" end="00:00:22.800" style="s2">power of three</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.160" end="00:00:24.720" style="s2">so what that looks like is simply having</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.800" end="00:00:27.119" style="s2">three friends who</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.720" end="00:00:28.880" style="s2">want to also make thirty two thousand</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.119" end="00:00:31.279" style="s2">dollars a month eventually</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.880" end="00:00:32.960" style="s2">who are passionate about essential oils</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.279" end="00:00:34.719" style="s2">and getting the message out there</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.960" end="00:00:36.399" style="s2">all of those what those three friends</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.719" end="00:00:38.559" style="s2">just have to do is sign up three friends</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.399" end="00:00:40.399" style="s2">each get bringing us to nine people</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.559" end="00:00:42.399" style="s2">each of those nine sign up three friends</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.399" end="00:00:44.160" style="s2">bringing us to 27 people</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.399" end="00:00:46.559" style="s2">who sign up three friends bringing us to</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.160" end="00:00:48.640" style="s2">81 who signed up three friends bringing</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.559" end="00:00:50.239" style="s2">us to 243.</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.640" end="00:00:51.600" style="s2">it was hard to fit the people in so i</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.239" end="00:00:53.600" style="s2">just made little dots it&#39;s a nine by</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.600" end="00:00:55.280" style="s2">nine square equaling 81.</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.600" end="00:00:56.640" style="s2">um my hand got tired so they&#39;re bigger</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.280" end="00:00:58.320" style="s2">and then they get smaller so i&#39;m sorry</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.640" end="00:00:59.840" style="s2">that you can&#39;t see that and then i just</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.320" end="00:01:02.079" style="s2">switched to making each one of these</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.840" end="00:01:05.680" style="s2">squares so each one of those 81 people</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.079" end="00:01:07.280" style="s2">each sign up three bringing us to 729</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.680" end="00:01:09.760" style="s2">for each sign up three so we have a</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.280" end="00:01:12.479" style="s2">three by three</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.760" end="00:01:12.880" style="s2">meta square of the of nine of these</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.479" end="00:01:17.280" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.880" end="00:01:21.040" style="s2">so we&#39;re at 2187 people for a total of 3</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.280" end="00:01:23.200" style="s2">280 people now that can seem daunting</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.040" end="00:01:25.040" style="s2">but if you just keep at it you will</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.200" end="00:01:29.680" style="s2">eventually get to 32</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.040" end="00:01:29.680" style="s2">000 a month after all there are</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.920" end="00:01:36.159" style="s2">7.6 billion people on this planet</p>

<p begin="00:03:16.080" end="00:03:19.599" style="s2">consuming</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.200" end="00:03:20.640" style="s2">and fifty dollars worth of essential</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.599" end="00:03:22.959" style="s2">oils per month</p>

<p begin="00:03:22.959" end="00:03:27.040" style="s2">fifty dollars of essential oils i would</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.640" end="00:03:28.319" style="s2">only do it if i was growing a business</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.040" end="00:03:30.319" style="s2">and i knew that i was gonna eventually</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.319" end="00:03:30.799" style="s2">get to the 32 000 right i want to invest</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.319" end="00:03:34.560" style="s2">in my</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.799" end="00:03:36.959" style="s2">in my future my family&#39;s future so</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.560" end="00:03:38.239" style="s2">these people it would be negative 150</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.959" end="00:03:39.440" style="s2">they&#39;re earning</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.239" end="00:03:41.360" style="s2">and a lot of them are living on less</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.440" end="00:03:43.680" style="s2">than a dollar a day so</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.360" end="00:03:44.560" style="s2">that line probably isn&#39;t there well this</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.680" end="00:03:46.080" style="s2">line</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.560" end="00:03:47.680" style="s2">needed that line in order to make their</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.080" end="00:03:50.080" style="s2">measly nine dollars a month</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.680" end="00:03:51.519" style="s2">so they&#39;re probably also not buying 150</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.080" end="00:03:55.280" style="s2">worth of essential oils</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.519" end="00:03:57.760" style="s2">um fifty dollars huh oh</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.280" end="00:03:58.879" style="s2">looks like the pyramid just collapsed</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.760" end="00:04:01.840" style="s2">because in order</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.879" end="00:04:04.000" style="s2">for you to get to 32 000 you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.840" end="00:04:07.280" style="s2">feeding off of</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.000" end="00:04:09.040" style="s2">3 000 people&#39;s work and commitment</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.280" end="00:04:10.879" style="s2">and their passion for essential oils in</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.040" end="00:04:13.200" style="s2">order to hope to get to that level</p>

<p begin="00:04:13.200" end="00:04:16.959" style="s2">have been lied to</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.720" end="00:04:19.519" style="s2">every mlm is designed to have this</p>
