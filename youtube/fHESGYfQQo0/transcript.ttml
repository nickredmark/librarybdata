<p begin="00:00:01.480" end="00:00:06.290" style="s2">hello thank you for being here welcome</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.040" end="00:00:08.719" style="s2">this is a conversation with Eric Godsey</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.290" end="00:00:11.590" style="s2">it&#39;s about love and truth and waking up</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.719" end="00:00:13.880" style="s2">into our fate important topics I think I</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.590" end="00:00:16.160" style="s2">think of course they have important</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.880" end="00:00:19.070" style="s2">fucking topics and I think there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.160" end="00:00:21.830" style="s2">real generative parts of this dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.070" end="00:00:23.420" style="s2">and so yeah I&#39;m excited to share it with</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.830" end="00:00:25.880" style="s2">you Eric someone that I&#39;ve wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.420" end="00:00:28.099" style="s2">have on the channel for a long time he</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.880" end="00:00:30.230" style="s2">really is one of the top people that I</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.099" end="00:00:31.880" style="s2">have wanted to engage in this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.230" end="00:00:33.950" style="s2">dialogue with it&#39;s partly because we</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.880" end="00:00:35.510" style="s2">share similar affinity for union</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.950" end="00:00:37.910" style="s2">thinking it&#39;s also because of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.510" end="00:00:39.320" style="s2">general sense of I get of how he shows</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.910" end="00:00:41.750" style="s2">up to the world and shows up to</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.320" end="00:00:42.920" style="s2">conversation and I respect it a lot he</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.750" end="00:00:46.070" style="s2">also has a degree in cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.920" end="00:00:47.809" style="s2">psychology and is of course interested</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.070" end="00:00:50.450" style="s2">in philosophy and psychology more</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.809" end="00:00:53.300" style="s2">broadly so we share you know an affinity</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.450" end="00:00:54.649" style="s2">for that as well yeah I invite you to</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.300" end="00:00:56.539" style="s2">take the time with this I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.649" end="00:01:02.510" style="s2">some meaningful metaphors here I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.539" end="00:01:05.330" style="s2">we advance you know our own intrigue and</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.510" end="00:01:07.490" style="s2">understanding about these topics or at</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.330" end="00:01:10.939" style="s2">least it felt that there was that</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.490" end="00:01:13.130" style="s2">positive movement of understanding in</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.939" end="00:01:18.740" style="s2">this dialogue and so I hope that that is</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.130" end="00:01:20.470" style="s2">something that you get a lot of value</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.740" end="00:01:23.350" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.470" end="00:01:25.690" style="s2">all right that&#39;s the click so I can line</p>

<p begin="00:01:36.610" end="00:01:41.140" style="s2">interesting moment because I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.160" end="00:01:42.550" style="s2">aware of you and what you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.140" end="00:01:45.340" style="s2">putting out there into the world for</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.550" end="00:01:47.710" style="s2">probably god I don&#39;t know at least at</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.340" end="00:01:50.170" style="s2">least three years that seems to come</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.710" end="00:01:51.490" style="s2">into my mind since pretty close from the</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.170" end="00:01:54.400" style="s2">beginning since you started the</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.490" end="00:01:56.470" style="s2">individuation podcast and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.400" end="00:01:59.530" style="s2">was just because we share a lot of you</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.470" end="00:02:01.840" style="s2">find that by the way Mandy how&#39;d you</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.530" end="00:02:03.970" style="s2">find it I have no idea hmm</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.840" end="00:02:05.650" style="s2">I have no idea you know it was one of</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.970" end="00:02:10.510" style="s2">many things that I probably was</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.650" end="00:02:16.690" style="s2">listening to and you know God it could</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.510" end="00:02:18.340" style="s2">be I think there&#39;s something that who</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.690" end="00:02:21.670" style="s2">knows might have been googling some</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.340" end="00:02:23.200" style="s2">Union thing maybe yeah I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.670" end="00:02:26.260" style="s2">probably what it was I probably typed in</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.200" end="00:02:28.570" style="s2">individuation of some things like that</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.260" end="00:02:30.010" style="s2">you&#39;re one of the only six people who do</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.570" end="00:02:32.440" style="s2">that Yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.010" end="00:02:34.180" style="s2">well that&#39;s a pretty interesting thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.440" end="00:02:37.480" style="s2">to have in common to begin with so</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.180" end="00:02:39.640" style="s2">before I say too much can you introduce</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.480" end="00:02:42.520" style="s2">yourself and a little bit about what</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.640" end="00:02:48.100" style="s2">you&#39;re about to me really and also and</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.520" end="00:02:51.130" style="s2">also our listeners for sure um so I&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.100" end="00:02:53.470" style="s2">love with psychology my favorite angle</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.130" end="00:02:57.190" style="s2">to look at psychology from is Jungian</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.470" end="00:02:59.350" style="s2">psychology I got a degree in cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.190" end="00:03:01.180" style="s2">psychology a Bachelors of Science I</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.350" end="00:03:03.519" style="s2">thought about getting a PhD in clinical</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.180" end="00:03:05.260" style="s2">psychology but I thought for about two</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.519" end="00:03:06.640" style="s2">to three years after I graduated how</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.260" end="00:03:09.970" style="s2">could I help the greatest number of</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.640" end="00:03:12.400" style="s2">people and it came down to do I get a</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.970" end="00:03:15.370" style="s2">PhD and sit in an office and help maybe</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.400" end="00:03:18.700" style="s2">20 to 25 people a year or do I learn how</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.370" end="00:03:21.160" style="s2">to run a company and then use the engine</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.700" end="00:03:22.690" style="s2">of a company to put out products that I</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.160" end="00:03:25.269" style="s2">think will genuinely help people</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.690" end="00:03:27.489" style="s2">psychologies and I eventually picked the</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.269" end="00:03:29.410" style="s2">second one and then it was about</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.489" end="00:03:30.670" style="s2">learning how to fucking do that and</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.410" end="00:03:33.910" style="s2">that&#39;s basically been what I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.670" end="00:03:36.850" style="s2">trying to do the last four or five years</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.910" end="00:03:39.690" style="s2">right now I work out on it um I work for</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.850" end="00:03:43.780" style="s2">Aubrey Markus on like his personal team</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.690" end="00:03:46.540" style="s2">and I&#39;m just reading and writing and</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.780" end="00:03:48.250" style="s2">learning and trying to figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.540" end="00:03:50.920" style="s2">the fuck to be a person the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.250" end="00:03:52.860" style="s2">I&#39;m most interested in is essentially</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.920" end="00:03:55.720" style="s2">the stories that we tell ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.860" end="00:03:57.520" style="s2">what is the most adaptive story that a</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.720" end="00:03:59.760" style="s2">human can tell themselves that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.520" end="00:04:03.400" style="s2">my big question that I&#39;m asking myself</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.760" end="00:04:05.080" style="s2">right so what is the most adaptive story</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.400" end="00:04:07.510" style="s2">we can tell ourselves and do we tell</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.080" end="00:04:10.110" style="s2">ourselves it or do we sort of we sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.510" end="00:04:12.520" style="s2">lever out and realize it after the fact</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.110" end="00:04:14.290" style="s2">yeah my truth is I don&#39;t know what the</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.520" end="00:04:16.390" style="s2">most adaptive story is that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.290" end="00:04:20.910" style="s2">that I&#39;m going to attempt to seek my</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.390" end="00:04:23.740" style="s2">entire life I do think that most of us</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.910" end="00:04:26.530" style="s2">live the beginning of our lives</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.740" end="00:04:28.930" style="s2">unconsciously expressing a story that we</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.530" end="00:04:30.610" style="s2">put together as children and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.930" end="00:04:33.370" style="s2">this moment that can happen in maybe</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.610" end="00:04:36.580" style="s2">your late teens or 20s or 30s where</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.370" end="00:04:40.810" style="s2">there&#39;s this first moment of oh I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.580" end="00:04:42.970" style="s2">been a zombie living out programs and</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.810" end="00:04:44.740" style="s2">then it&#39;s from that point where you can</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.970" end="00:04:46.360" style="s2">begin to look at like what are my</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.740" end="00:04:48.190" style="s2">stories which are essentially what are</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.360" end="00:04:50.650" style="s2">my programs what are my unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.190" end="00:04:53.050" style="s2">beliefs about relationships and myself</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.650" end="00:04:57.220" style="s2">in the world and money and achievement</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.050" end="00:04:58.960" style="s2">and all that shit and do I want to</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.220" end="00:05:00.700" style="s2">continue to live out the stories that I</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.960" end="00:05:02.290" style="s2">put together as a seven year old or a</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.700" end="00:05:04.090" style="s2">four year old or do I want to make new</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.290" end="00:05:05.470" style="s2">stories and then it&#39;s about what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.090" end="00:05:08.440" style="s2">most effective way to make new stories</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.470" end="00:05:12.100" style="s2">all right do we have a climb out of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.440" end="00:05:14.370" style="s2">story making for sure um I think flow</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.100" end="00:05:19.660" style="s2">states are one of the ways that we</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.370" end="00:05:22.300" style="s2">escape our stories I think that bliss</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.660" end="00:05:24.280" style="s2">moment between a lover&#39;s eyes where you</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.300" end="00:05:27.520" style="s2">guys are making love like that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.280" end="00:05:30.100" style="s2">escape from the story doing any type of</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.520" end="00:05:33.670" style="s2">good work truly I think it&#39;s flow States</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.100" end="00:05:35.170" style="s2">and practicing awareness / meditation</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.670" end="00:05:38.650" style="s2">those are the ways that we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.170" end="00:05:40.150" style="s2">temporarily step out of the story so</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.650" end="00:05:42.430" style="s2">it&#39;s that place between stimulus and</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.150" end="00:05:45.940" style="s2">response to put it a slightly different</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.430" end="00:05:47.550" style="s2">way it&#39;s that revolution of attachment</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.940" end="00:05:51.960" style="s2">and detachment</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.550" end="00:05:53.370" style="s2">it&#39;s presence the the thing the thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.960" end="00:06:00.110" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting to me about that</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.370" end="00:06:02.849" style="s2">though is that so in the moment of</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.110" end="00:06:06.659" style="s2">experiencing that the lovers eyes let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.849" end="00:06:09.690" style="s2">say making love there is just that and</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.659" end="00:06:11.669" style="s2">you are flowing with it and there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.690" end="00:06:14.310" style="s2">the grasping to make sense of what</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.669" end="00:06:16.889" style="s2">you&#39;re doing from that maybe it go a</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.310" end="00:06:18.750" style="s2">core story like or but it&#39;s not fair to</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.889" end="00:06:20.460" style="s2">just obviously I&#39;m lump the ego and</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.750" end="00:06:23.370" style="s2">stories together because of course these</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.460" end="00:06:26.909" style="s2">stories play out unconsciously and they</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.370" end="00:06:28.800" style="s2">have a you know their wellspring is one</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.909" end="00:06:31.020" style="s2">from a Union perspective you would</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.800" end="00:06:34.050" style="s2">understand as being nested in in the in</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.020" end="00:06:36.840" style="s2">the unconscious so so it&#39;s in the moment</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.050" end="00:06:38.940" style="s2">of it we are we are we escaped the</p>

<p begin="00:06:38.940" end="00:06:45.060" style="s2">outcome necessarily is or what the what</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.270" end="00:06:47.699" style="s2">the story is but but it seems to me that</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.060" end="00:06:51.569" style="s2">there&#39;s still so much like there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.699" end="00:06:53.909" style="s2">a cook could we not see that as just</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.569" end="00:06:56.759" style="s2">living out a character just expressing a</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.909" end="00:06:59.400" style="s2">character expressing a role purely for</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.759" end="00:07:01.259" style="s2">that duration and then after the fact we</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.400" end="00:07:02.969" style="s2">say well actually I was now I can wake</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.259" end="00:07:05.219" style="s2">up again and I&#39;ve seen that I was</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.969" end="00:07:06.810" style="s2">actually engaging in another sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.219" end="00:07:08.250" style="s2">pattern in another sort of story with</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.810" end="00:07:13.919" style="s2">someone and the analysis might come</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.250" end="00:07:17.159" style="s2">later on so in that sense oh so the</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.919" end="00:07:19.740" style="s2">analysis will rise only after the flow</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.159" end="00:07:23.400" style="s2">state is over and then we can post hoc</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.740" end="00:07:25.469" style="s2">story lines what it is that happened but</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.400" end="00:07:26.990" style="s2">in the moment there was not a story but</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.469" end="00:07:31.860" style="s2">I would agree with you that</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.990" end="00:07:34.650" style="s2">fundamentally it seems to be that we are</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.860" end="00:07:39.680" style="s2">acting out a character and that that</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.650" end="00:07:42.479" style="s2">character is to a very large degree</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.680" end="00:07:44.849" style="s2">beyond our ability to change but I do</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.479" end="00:07:46.919" style="s2">think that we have a little bit of an</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.849" end="00:07:48.960" style="s2">ability to change it and that little bit</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.919" end="00:07:51.240" style="s2">of an ability to change it is more than</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.960" end="00:07:54.659" style="s2">enough to give people meaning to help</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.240" end="00:07:59.389" style="s2">people transform their lives and to make</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.659" end="00:08:01.250" style="s2">the world a truly better place</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.389" end="00:08:03.710" style="s2">but it&#39;s gonna be hard yeah but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.250" end="00:08:06.199" style="s2">gonna be fun yeah yeah that&#39;s beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.710" end="00:08:08.900" style="s2">I think I&#39;ve heard you mentioned once</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.199" end="00:08:11.780" style="s2">and it&#39;s an idea that resonates with me</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.900" end="00:08:16.370" style="s2">also this notion of waking up into our</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.780" end="00:08:18.050" style="s2">fate and so you&#39;ve just mentioned there</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.370" end="00:08:20.030" style="s2">this idea we can change ourselves a</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.050" end="00:08:22.819" style="s2">little bit to what degree do you</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.030" end="00:08:25.009" style="s2">understand that as essentially and</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.819" end="00:08:26.919" style="s2">evolving into who you are and playing a</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.009" end="00:08:30.280" style="s2">sort of an active role in becoming</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.919" end="00:08:32.740" style="s2">unfolding that nature that you might</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.280" end="00:08:38.570" style="s2">metaphorically consider as a seed which</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.740" end="00:08:42.250" style="s2">for Philips yeah one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.570" end="00:08:47.870" style="s2">powerful ideas that recurs to me is that</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.250" end="00:08:51.260" style="s2">I am simply burning away my bullshit so</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.870" end="00:08:53.269" style="s2">I can wake up to my fate which is like</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.260" end="00:08:57.320" style="s2">when I really think about what that</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.269" end="00:09:01.279" style="s2">means that fucking chills me but the way</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.320" end="00:09:04.360" style="s2">that I kind of see it is you come into</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.279" end="00:09:08.570" style="s2">the world with a specific energy</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.360" end="00:09:10.190" style="s2">signature and it&#39;s a coagulation of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.570" end="00:09:12.529" style="s2">set of genes you got from both of your</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.190" end="00:09:15.500" style="s2">parents the environment in which your</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.529" end="00:09:19.010" style="s2">mom was creating you inside of her womb</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.500" end="00:09:21.980" style="s2">and anything that she ate or did or felt</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.010" end="00:09:25.279" style="s2">like affected like the primordial stuff</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.980" end="00:09:27.500" style="s2">that made you and in like the moment</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.279" end="00:09:29.630" style="s2">you&#39;re born it&#39;s like I do think just</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.500" end="00:09:32.269" style="s2">like the oak seed is destined to be a</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.630" end="00:09:36.769" style="s2">tree you are destined to be some</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.269" end="00:09:38.899" style="s2">specific thing but just like a tree just</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.769" end="00:09:41.329" style="s2">like a seed can be planted and rotten</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.899" end="00:09:45.079" style="s2">soil and there&#39;s always bullshit around</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.329" end="00:09:48.079" style="s2">you we aggregate years and years of</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.079" end="00:09:50.120" style="s2">bullshit on top of whatever our being is</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.079" end="00:09:53.600" style="s2">or whatever our destiny is whatever our</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.120" end="00:09:56.779" style="s2">core essence is and then I think you</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.600" end="00:09:58.760" style="s2">know your adulthood is basically show up</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.779" end="00:10:02.740" style="s2">and do the fucking work of burning away</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.760" end="00:10:02.740" style="s2">the parts of you that aren&#39;t real and</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.829" end="00:10:08.240" style="s2">you know I think there&#39;s a quote by</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.320" end="00:10:10.640" style="s2">Confucius and that you have two lives</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.240" end="00:10:12.340" style="s2">and your second life starts when you</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.640" end="00:10:16.060" style="s2">realize you only have one</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.340" end="00:10:18.010" style="s2">and it&#39;s this idea that your first life</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.060" end="00:10:19.570" style="s2">is the life that you don&#39;t even realize</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.010" end="00:10:21.670" style="s2">you have you&#39;re just unconscious and</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.570" end="00:10:23.920" style="s2">then I think we all have this moment and</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.670" end="00:10:26.850" style="s2">it tends to happen around the early 20s</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.920" end="00:10:31.300" style="s2">maybe early 30s where you&#39;re like whoa</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.850" end="00:10:34.120" style="s2">whoa I am this is the first moment I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.300" end="00:10:35.650" style="s2">ever been self reflective and I see what</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.120" end="00:10:38.950" style="s2">I&#39;m doing and I want to change it and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.650" end="00:10:41.410" style="s2">want to be like we all have this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.950" end="00:10:44.620" style="s2">the person that we know we could be all</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.410" end="00:10:46.720" style="s2">of us and we know the things that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.620" end="00:10:50.230" style="s2">doing that aren&#39;t in alignment with that</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.720" end="00:10:55.180" style="s2">part with that potential and I think the</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.230" end="00:10:57.640" style="s2">way that I see it is you are in a river</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.180" end="00:11:00.880" style="s2">and it is taking you somewhere you can</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.640" end="00:11:03.220" style="s2">learn to swim or you can be floundering</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.880" end="00:11:04.960" style="s2">and drowning and smacking people who are</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.220" end="00:11:06.940" style="s2">around you and trying to dig your nails</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.960" end="00:11:10.660" style="s2">into the side of the river and I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.940" end="00:11:13.120" style="s2">that aligning with you know who you are</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.660" end="00:11:14.800" style="s2">is to learn to swim or to really to</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.120" end="00:11:17.140" style="s2">float you know like I think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.800" end="00:11:22.390" style="s2">the grace moment is when you really just</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.140" end="00:11:25.780" style="s2">ah this is what I am this is how I am in</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.390" end="00:11:29.380" style="s2">this moment you know it&#39;s akin to</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.780" end="00:11:33.820" style="s2">dancing yes yes I think that river</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.380" end="00:11:39.040" style="s2">metaphor is is a beautiful one what</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.820" end="00:11:42.310" style="s2">comes to mind is what kinds of floating</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.040" end="00:11:44.620" style="s2">are there then we might have seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.310" end="00:11:47.350" style="s2">our capacity to discern to pay attention</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.620" end="00:11:50.260" style="s2">to orient more gracefully around</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.350" end="00:11:52.480" style="s2">obstacles or dancing along with others</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.260" end="00:11:56.410" style="s2">floating similarly something we can</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.480" end="00:12:00.610" style="s2">develop and perhaps there are I wonder</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.410" end="00:12:03.220" style="s2">if there&#39;s some sort of if there&#39;s maybe</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.610" end="00:12:07.270" style="s2">too broad and that might be a bit too</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.220" end="00:12:08.910" style="s2">bit too basic but if there&#39;s in some of</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.270" end="00:12:12.160" style="s2">the psychedelic experiences I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.910" end="00:12:14.320" style="s2">some particularly powerful ones number</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.160" end="00:12:17.880" style="s2">of years ago now maybe five or six years</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.320" end="00:12:22.900" style="s2">ago that sparked a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.880" end="00:12:24.490" style="s2">research a lot of time reflecting to try</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.900" end="00:12:27.370" style="s2">and make sense of what occurred was a</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.490" end="00:12:30.880" style="s2">particularly powerful about five and a</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.370" end="00:12:32.440" style="s2">half gram of dried psilocybin they&#39;ll do</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.880" end="00:12:35.740" style="s2">it right</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.440" end="00:12:37.090" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m along with though and there was</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.740" end="00:12:38.950" style="s2">a bit of a progression up to that point</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.090" end="00:12:40.420" style="s2">but I found the jump from like three and</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.950" end="00:12:42.160" style="s2">a half grams to 5 grams very</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.420" end="00:12:46.960" style="s2">considerable and I had done that quite a</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.160" end="00:12:53.380" style="s2">few like quite a lot and it was as</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.960" end="00:12:57.210" style="s2">though in the climax of it my experience</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.380" end="00:13:01.240" style="s2">my capacity for coherence was reduced to</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.210" end="00:13:03.850" style="s2">two modes of orientation one which we</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.240" end="00:13:05.770" style="s2">could one that I used the word</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.850" end="00:13:09.370" style="s2">confrontation to describe and the other</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.770" end="00:13:11.350" style="s2">surrender and what&#39;s interesting is that</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.370" end="00:13:15.960" style="s2">often people use the word surrender to</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.350" end="00:13:18.730" style="s2">signify this going with the flow right</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.960" end="00:13:21.940" style="s2">but it seemed to me also that there</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.730" end="00:13:24.070" style="s2">might be a positive and negative way to</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.940" end="00:13:27.070" style="s2">manifest each of these modes of</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.070" end="00:13:31.000" style="s2">orientation because we&#39;ve had times</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.070" end="00:13:32.740" style="s2">where someone is manipulating someone</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.000" end="00:13:34.690" style="s2">else and perhaps surrendering to that</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.740" end="00:13:37.180" style="s2">flow is maybe not what&#39;s best for anyone</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.690" end="00:13:38.770" style="s2">involved so how then do you hold your</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.180" end="00:13:40.150" style="s2">back to it so the other ways to hold</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.770" end="00:13:42.250" style="s2">your boundaries right so maybe this</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.150" end="00:13:44.170" style="s2">maybe this confrontation is oh actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.250" end="00:13:46.240" style="s2">like this log that&#39;s coming at me or</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.170" end="00:13:47.650" style="s2">this these leaves there you go there are</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.240" end="00:13:49.420" style="s2">some leaves in the in the stream I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.650" end="00:13:50.830" style="s2">need to orient around them that&#39;s no log</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.420" end="00:13:52.890" style="s2">there&#39;s some leaves I&#39;ll just take them</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.830" end="00:13:54.820" style="s2">I&#39;ll take those take the feeling of that</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.890" end="00:13:57.310" style="s2">does that is that something that</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.820" end="00:13:59.470" style="s2">resonates with you too to begin with two</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.310" end="00:14:01.300" style="s2">broad modes of orientation in response</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.470" end="00:14:04.060" style="s2">to what is effectively the appearance of</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.300" end="00:14:05.340" style="s2">radical anomaly and novelty as we</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.060" end="00:14:09.560" style="s2">ingress</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.340" end="00:14:14.480" style="s2">so here&#39;s how I orient myself</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.560" end="00:14:17.410" style="s2">because I admit that I am an eggnog ma</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.480" end="00:14:22.189" style="s2">to myself which is a quote from young</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.410" end="00:14:25.550" style="s2">how I get to know myself is I do my best</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.189" end="00:14:27.379" style="s2">to admit to myself what my truth is in</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.550" end="00:14:29.660" style="s2">this moment like what feels like my</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.379" end="00:14:32.600" style="s2">truth so the two big things are</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.660" end="00:14:34.459" style="s2">cultivate awareness there&#39;s all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.600" end="00:14:37.100" style="s2">practices that I can do to do that and</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.459" end="00:14:40.490" style="s2">then to cultivate the courage to speak</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.100" end="00:14:44.449" style="s2">and act my truth to myself and to others</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.490" end="00:14:47.149" style="s2">and if I do that I will find where my</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.449" end="00:14:51.139" style="s2">boundaries are I will find how to</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.149" end="00:14:54.309" style="s2">respond to leave or to a log because the</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.139" end="00:14:57.939" style="s2">truth is that each of us our</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.309" end="00:15:04.899" style="s2">consciousness is resting inside of this</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.939" end="00:15:07.370" style="s2">magical amazing incomprehensible thing</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.899" end="00:15:10.819" style="s2">that you could get to know if you wanted</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.370" end="00:15:13.249" style="s2">to and I think the way you get to know</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.819" end="00:15:15.709" style="s2">what this thing is which is your your</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.249" end="00:15:18.740" style="s2">nervous system I think is the pinnacle</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.709" end="00:15:20.449" style="s2">of creation in the known universe you</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.740" end="00:15:23.569" style="s2">know that we know of right now it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.449" end="00:15:26.149" style="s2">nervous system and you get to learn new</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.569" end="00:15:29.089" style="s2">yours and I think the way you find</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.149" end="00:15:33.350" style="s2">optimal Grace in this life is to figure</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.089" end="00:15:35.930" style="s2">out what your truth is and truth might</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.350" end="00:15:38.000" style="s2">be the wrong word but I think it if it</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.930" end="00:15:41.750" style="s2">makes sense to most people when I ask</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.000" end="00:15:44.629" style="s2">you what&#39;s your truth right now you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.750" end="00:15:46.790" style="s2">I&#39;m more than happy to use truth to</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.629" end="00:15:49.279" style="s2">refer to that I mean we could I was just</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.790" end="00:15:51.500" style="s2">writing yesterday about all the</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.279" end="00:15:53.589" style="s2">different ways we can use truth language</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.500" end="00:15:57.350" style="s2">is one of those things it&#39;s it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.589" end="00:15:59.569" style="s2">I&#39;m not really so fussed about quibbling</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.350" end="00:16:01.040" style="s2">with people to be honest with you I mean</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.569" end="00:16:02.360" style="s2">sometimes there&#39;s a time for quibbling</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.040" end="00:16:04.250" style="s2">right if you&#39;re sitting down to have an</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.360" end="00:16:06.559" style="s2">analytic philosophical discussion it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.250" end="00:16:09.129" style="s2">like no fuck you that&#39;s not how it going</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.559" end="00:16:11.660" style="s2">to be using this word but but really</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.129" end="00:16:14.829" style="s2">number of people I speak to coming from</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.660" end="00:16:17.629" style="s2">all these different epistemic</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.829" end="00:16:20.029" style="s2">backgrounds many people autodidact</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.629" end="00:16:21.070" style="s2">others trained in certain schools of</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.029" end="00:16:24.250" style="s2">thinking</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.070" end="00:16:25.750" style="s2">it&#39;s just so many it&#39;s like there&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:16:25.750" end="00:16:30.130" style="s2">dialogical process is one way it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.610" end="00:16:32.170" style="s2">a translation of of that of the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.130" end="00:16:33.070" style="s2">of the feeling ultimately of what</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.170" end="00:16:34.600" style="s2">someone&#39;s trying to communicate</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.070" end="00:16:36.610" style="s2">especially when it comes to what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.600" end="00:16:38.290" style="s2">talking about here which is something</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.610" end="00:16:39.940" style="s2">about what it is like to show up</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.290" end="00:16:41.500" style="s2">meaningfully to the world and to be in</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.940" end="00:16:42.790" style="s2">some relationship with yourself and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.500" end="00:16:45.940" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.790" end="00:16:48.820" style="s2">truth is I mean an authentic expression</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.940" end="00:16:51.160" style="s2">at a realization of what is of what is</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.820" end="00:16:52.750" style="s2">resonant real these kind of words are</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.160" end="00:16:55.830" style="s2">what I get from how you&#39;re using the</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.750" end="00:17:00.070" style="s2">word truth they&#39;re correct yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.830" end="00:17:04.110" style="s2">there&#39;s something again that comes to</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.070" end="00:17:07.780" style="s2">mind which is I&#39;m interested to hear how</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.110" end="00:17:11.470" style="s2">how you articulate the decision of</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.780" end="00:17:14.740" style="s2">whether or not to speak or let the</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.470" end="00:17:16.750" style="s2">energy let the images continue to</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.740" end="00:17:18.310" style="s2">coalesce right because there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.750" end="00:17:22.170" style="s2">different truths I&#39;ve got stuff popping</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.310" end="00:17:26.560" style="s2">up all the time right but but but but it</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.170" end="00:17:27.610" style="s2">keeping keeping you know I say I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.560" end="00:17:29.710" style="s2">when we spoke on the phone you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.610" end="00:17:32.590" style="s2">the sort of a cultivation of competence</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.710" end="00:17:36.730" style="s2">right something I&#39;ve been trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.590" end="00:17:39.130" style="s2">is like develop over the last number of</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.730" end="00:17:41.710" style="s2">years it&#39;s not necessarily to jump on</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.130" end="00:17:43.950" style="s2">exact on it you don&#39;t jump on every</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.710" end="00:17:47.290" style="s2">tangent that comes along sometimes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.950" end="00:17:49.030" style="s2">you check in again so what comes up for</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.290" end="00:17:51.130" style="s2">you there in terms of when when do you</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.030" end="00:17:53.320" style="s2">express that truth versus when do you</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.130" end="00:17:57.400" style="s2">let coalesce into something a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.320" end="00:18:01.630" style="s2">more cultivated that&#39;s a great question</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.400" end="00:18:04.510" style="s2">and the way that I think about it is do</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.630" end="00:18:08.200" style="s2">I understand this well enough to express</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.510" end="00:18:10.650" style="s2">it in love if I don&#39;t feel like I can</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.200" end="00:18:15.010" style="s2">express it in love I&#39;m not done</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.650" end="00:18:18.400" style="s2">understanding it and so that&#39;s to myself</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.010" end="00:18:20.170" style="s2">and to other people and the other part</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.400" end="00:18:25.510" style="s2">of that question is it&#39;s kind of this</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.170" end="00:18:26.830" style="s2">intuitive thing they to start by</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.510" end="00:18:29.410" style="s2">speaking your truth and you will</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.830" end="00:18:31.330" style="s2">probably be clumsy and people around you</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.410" end="00:18:33.670" style="s2">are probably going to not respond to it</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.330" end="00:18:35.590" style="s2">very well then you&#39;ve got to start</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.670" end="00:18:39.820" style="s2">the alternative is you&#39;re just lying</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.590" end="00:18:43.930" style="s2">like dude come on early 20s really was</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.820" end="00:18:45.880" style="s2">like 19 and 20 and 21 I was not in truth</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.930" end="00:18:47.710" style="s2">with anyone who was around me and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.880" end="00:18:49.570" style="s2">everyone around me that I called a</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.710" end="00:18:52.690" style="s2">friend were really just people who drink</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.570" end="00:18:54.850" style="s2">with me and there was no like authentic</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.690" end="00:18:56.500" style="s2">like we could get drunk and laugh and</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.850" end="00:18:59.920" style="s2">say that we loved each other but I knew</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.500" end="00:19:03.910" style="s2">I wasn&#39;t connecting to them because I</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.920" end="00:19:06.460" style="s2">wasn&#39;t in truth with myself and now like</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.910" end="00:19:11.080" style="s2">all of my relationships are so much</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.460" end="00:19:13.330" style="s2">deeper and it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.080" end="00:19:15.070" style="s2">thing when you cultivate that type of</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.330" end="00:19:16.240" style="s2">connection with any of your friends like</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.070" end="00:19:18.940" style="s2">I&#39;ve been going through kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.240" end="00:19:20.590" style="s2">emotional time this last week and I can</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.940" end="00:19:24.970" style="s2">cry in front of all of my friends and</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.590" end="00:19:28.030" style="s2">there&#39;s no like it&#39;s just I can see that</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.970" end="00:19:31.540" style="s2">my crying gives them permission to cry</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.030" end="00:19:33.790" style="s2">in the future I feel cathartic because</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.540" end="00:19:36.970" style="s2">I&#39;m not hiding something that feels true</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.790" end="00:19:39.250" style="s2">and I love them because I see how they</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.970" end="00:19:42.070" style="s2">respond when they see me in that state</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.250" end="00:19:44.770" style="s2">and seven years ago I would have</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.070" end="00:19:51.160" style="s2">pretended that I wasn&#39;t sad and I just</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.770" end="00:19:54.280" style="s2">think that so many of us are not being</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.160" end="00:19:56.290" style="s2">ourselves because we think that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.280" end="00:19:58.450" style="s2">wrong or we think that people won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.290" end="00:20:01.170" style="s2">accept us and like what I find time and</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.450" end="00:20:05.110" style="s2">time and time and time and time again is</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.170" end="00:20:08.740" style="s2">anyone who is willing to show up in life</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.110" end="00:20:11.950" style="s2">who isn&#39;t hiding from themselves they</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.740" end="00:20:13.180" style="s2">respond so well to when when someone</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.950" end="00:20:16.030" style="s2">speaks the truth and the thing that I</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.180" end="00:20:20.410" style="s2">want to point out is all of us have this</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.030" end="00:20:22.270" style="s2">ability to detect in another person they</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.410" end="00:20:24.820" style="s2">just said something that was hard for</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.270" end="00:20:28.660" style="s2">them to admit like we all have this</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.820" end="00:20:31.330" style="s2">radar thing and it&#39;s so counterintuitive</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.660" end="00:20:33.280" style="s2">but people are afraid to admit the</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.330" end="00:20:36.790" style="s2">things that they&#39;re afraid to admit but</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.280" end="00:20:40.030" style="s2">like people love you and admire you when</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.790" end="00:20:42.400" style="s2">you do it the people who market are the</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.030" end="00:20:44.020" style="s2">people who are terrified to do it for</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.400" end="00:20:45.820" style="s2">themselves and those are the people who</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.020" end="00:20:47.640" style="s2">will mark you and it&#39;s just like oh this</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.820" end="00:20:52.300" style="s2">is someone who&#39;s afraid</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.640" end="00:20:53.860" style="s2">yes yes that&#39;s beautiful well I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.300" end="00:20:57.010" style="s2">glad to hear that that&#39;s an experience</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.860" end="00:21:03.550" style="s2">you have in your life thank you</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.010" end="00:21:08.640" style="s2">yeah here&#39;s something else I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.550" end="00:21:12.820" style="s2">battling with and it relates slightly</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.640" end="00:21:19.060" style="s2">and I hear you by the way I I really</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.820" end="00:21:20.800" style="s2">hear you let&#39;s consider someone take</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.060" end="00:21:23.790" style="s2">myself we didn&#39;t have to think about</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.800" end="00:21:23.790" style="s2">anyone else let&#39;s do that</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.680" end="00:21:31.480" style="s2">let&#39;s say I&#39;m a child they say I&#39;m in my</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.360" end="00:21:33.010" style="s2">teens I&#39;m in my teens let&#39;s say I</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.480" end="00:21:35.560" style="s2">haven&#39;t developed many of those</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.010" end="00:21:37.000" style="s2">relationships yet I would say actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.560" end="00:21:38.890" style="s2">in my case in fact I was developing</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.000" end="00:21:42.010" style="s2">those relationships from a young age I</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.890" end="00:21:45.310" style="s2">think this sort of showing up in truth</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.010" end="00:21:48.940" style="s2">is something that perhaps because of</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.310" end="00:21:51.790" style="s2">what occurred in my childhood was made</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.940" end="00:21:54.430" style="s2">perhaps more necessary for me to develop</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.790" end="00:21:57.520" style="s2">at a younger age but that&#39;s I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.430" end="00:22:00.250" style="s2">a continual process you know it&#39;s not so</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.520" end="00:22:02.290" style="s2">much one pill of becoming aware it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.250" end="00:22:06.040" style="s2">constant it&#39;s a constant struggle right</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.290" end="00:22:08.320" style="s2">there the capacity for delusion is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.040" end="00:22:10.360" style="s2">consistent it&#39;s continuous so it really</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.320" end="00:22:11.740" style="s2">is a continual waking up process I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.360" end="00:22:15.700" style="s2">that&#39;s really important to stress right</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.740" end="00:22:17.230" style="s2">and but let&#39;s say I&#39;m a teenager and I</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.700" end="00:22:24.190" style="s2">have not developed that many of these</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.230" end="00:22:27.340" style="s2">relationships am i inauthentic or am I</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.190" end="00:22:35.650" style="s2">in fact merely authentic lyrics pressing</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.340" end="00:22:38.020" style="s2">a less aware state of nature state of</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.650" end="00:22:39.850" style="s2">experience I&#39;ve been battling with this</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.020" end="00:22:41.110" style="s2">word authenticity a little bit recently</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.850" end="00:22:42.730" style="s2">it&#39;s been brought up to me and I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.110" end="00:22:44.680" style="s2">using it quite a lot it&#39;s like authentic</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.730" end="00:22:47.710" style="s2">expressionist right showing up</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.680" end="00:22:50.770" style="s2">authentically that even in the case of</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.710" end="00:22:53.640" style="s2">the lie is this something that is</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.770" end="00:22:56.190" style="s2">appropriate to say authentic or not</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.640" end="00:23:01.170" style="s2">I think authenticity depends on</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.190" end="00:23:03.630" style="s2">awareness and if you are 15 and you have</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.170" end="00:23:05.850" style="s2">never had it modeled for you about how</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.630" end="00:23:07.470" style="s2">to be courageous and speak your truth</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.850" end="00:23:09.150" style="s2">and you&#39;re not speaking your truth I</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.470" end="00:23:10.620" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t say that that person is</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.150" end="00:23:17.280" style="s2">inauthentic I would say that that person</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.620" end="00:23:19.530" style="s2">is 15 you know um for me like I look</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.280" end="00:23:21.870" style="s2">back on when I was 18 and a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.530" end="00:23:23.940" style="s2">stuff happened where I must have been</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.870" end="00:23:27.270" style="s2">depressed I must have been depressed but</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.940" end="00:23:29.970" style="s2">I was so unconscious that I don&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.270" end="00:23:32.669" style="s2">would be a lie to say that I remember</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.970" end="00:23:35.850" style="s2">feeling depressed but like I lived alone</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.669" end="00:23:37.110" style="s2">I had gotten rotator cuff surgery on my</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.850" end="00:23:39.540" style="s2">shoulder I had to stop playing</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.110" end="00:23:43.470" style="s2">basketball which was my entire life and</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.540" end="00:23:46.110" style="s2">I was taking oxy coding every day and I</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.470" end="00:23:48.990" style="s2">was eating and I gained like 40 pounds</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.110" end="00:23:51.540" style="s2">over like eight months and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.990" end="00:23:53.850" style="s2">remember being upset at all mmm but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.540" end="00:23:57.150" style="s2">because I felt like I was so fucking</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.850" end="00:24:00.630" style="s2">unconscious and so what I would say is</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.150" end="00:24:02.520" style="s2">that authenticity comes down to the</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.630" end="00:24:04.650" style="s2">degree of awareness that the individual</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.520" end="00:24:06.690" style="s2">has and nobody can make that claim for</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.650" end="00:24:09.720" style="s2">anyone other than themselves and so you</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.690" end="00:24:11.460" style="s2">are the supreme arbiter of whether or</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.720" end="00:24:15.570" style="s2">not you&#39;re being authentic</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.460" end="00:24:17.730" style="s2">you might feel justified to judge that</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.570" end="00:24:20.520" style="s2">someone else is not and you might be</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.730" end="00:24:22.919" style="s2">right some of the time but truly only</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.520" end="00:24:26.970" style="s2">you can know your degree of authenticity</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.919" end="00:24:30.809" style="s2">and I think that that is enough yes why</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.970" end="00:24:35.400" style="s2">I I definitely agree with that is on</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.809" end="00:24:39.120" style="s2">every individual to be the the measure</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.400" end="00:24:43.320" style="s2">of themselves this is that divine right</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.120" end="00:24:45.980" style="s2">I think we can argue quite strongly in</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.320" end="00:24:52.040" style="s2">it it&#39;s not a matter for argument really</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.980" end="00:24:52.040" style="s2">but it&#39;s interesting right because</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.620" end="00:25:00.559" style="s2">of where I&#39;m aiming and that&#39;s not to I</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.620" end="00:25:06.840" style="s2">say where we aim we have to have goals</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.990" end="00:25:11.520" style="s2">but also not to attach too hard right</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.840" end="00:25:15.480" style="s2">man so so with that in mind part of</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.520" end="00:25:18.240" style="s2">where I&#39;m aiming is the development of</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.480" end="00:25:22.410" style="s2">this sort of a character and presence</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.240" end="00:25:24.630" style="s2">that can hold a certain space for the</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.410" end="00:25:26.370" style="s2">authentic expression of others perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.630" end="00:25:29.309" style="s2">in a very high-pressure situation</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.370" end="00:25:31.670" style="s2">perhaps where it matters and I think it</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.309" end="00:25:35.130" style="s2">always matters actually but I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.670" end="00:25:39.480" style="s2">maybe some sometimes you feel the</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.130" end="00:25:43.559" style="s2">moments upon you more than others and in</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.480" end="00:25:47.670" style="s2">such situations it&#39;s difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.559" end="00:25:50.040" style="s2">imagine not finding yourself in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.670" end="00:25:51.570" style="s2">place of the judge right like if</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.040" end="00:25:54.600" style="s2">someone&#39;s trying to manipulate you for</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.570" end="00:25:56.760" style="s2">instance let&#39;s say it&#39;s like oh hang on</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.600" end="00:25:58.350" style="s2">busy you mentioned before it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.760" end="00:25:59.820" style="s2">feel when someone&#39;s showing up in a way</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.350" end="00:26:01.830" style="s2">that&#39;s difficult for them but true and</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.820" end="00:26:03.929" style="s2">so it sort of follows from that that</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.830" end="00:26:05.940" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense we get when someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.929" end="00:26:08.160" style="s2">holding something back and that that</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.940" end="00:26:10.470" style="s2">maybe is obvious someone so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.160" end="00:26:12.030" style="s2">talking to a friend or or a loving</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.470" end="00:26:13.950" style="s2">partner and what have you and they begin</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.030" end="00:26:15.300" style="s2">a sentence halfway and they trail off</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.950" end="00:26:17.250" style="s2">because they get nervous it&#39;s like oh</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.300" end="00:26:19.050" style="s2">I&#39;m I want to know what&#39;s at the end of</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.250" end="00:26:20.460" style="s2">that sentence that feels like something</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.050" end="00:26:22.860" style="s2">that we should be talking about and</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.460" end="00:26:26.280" style="s2">that&#39;s you know an obvious example but</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.860" end="00:26:31.860" style="s2">but when when something&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.280" end="00:26:33.929" style="s2">more subtle cool like it&#39;s a these can</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.860" end="00:26:38.250" style="s2">get zhem when do you see I&#39;m not so</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.929" end="00:26:41.370" style="s2">interested in calling someone out but we</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.250" end="00:26:43.110" style="s2">do we do this social fucking thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.370" end="00:26:45.420" style="s2">like no that was a misstep in the dance</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.110" end="00:26:49.890" style="s2">like I really still love you the dance</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.420" end="00:26:51.900" style="s2">continues but it&#39;s like I wonder can you</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.890" end="00:26:55.170" style="s2">can you comment on that it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.900" end="00:26:56.940" style="s2">that like it&#39;s isn&#39;t because it is on</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.170" end="00:26:58.530" style="s2">you to determine to be the measure of</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.940" end="00:27:00.570" style="s2">your own authenticity but nevertheless</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.530" end="00:27:02.130" style="s2">we still have to we have to fix things</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.570" end="00:27:03.840" style="s2">in the world where we put down</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.130" end="00:27:06.309" style="s2">boundaries that have an effect on others</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.840" end="00:27:08.289" style="s2">and there has to be a way to</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.309" end="00:27:10.599" style="s2">I mean you do that from your truth let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.289" end="00:27:13.269" style="s2">say and if you&#39;re not doing it from that</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.599" end="00:27:14.710" style="s2">then it&#39;s a puff you like I feel what</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.269" end="00:27:16.149" style="s2">you&#39;re asking so the first thing that I</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.710" end="00:27:17.440" style="s2">would say is you have a very specific</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.149" end="00:27:19.779" style="s2">thing that you&#39;re talking about that</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.440" end="00:27:24.119" style="s2">you&#39;re asking in a vague way but I will</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.779" end="00:27:27.419" style="s2">answer the vague way back there yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.119" end="00:27:29.950" style="s2">the greatest power that we have</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.419" end="00:27:32.649" style="s2">linguistically in the world is to ask a</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.950" end="00:27:35.190" style="s2">good question mm-hmm so if you feel</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.649" end="00:27:38.649" style="s2">anything weird and the other person</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.190" end="00:27:41.649" style="s2">become and train yourself to be a master</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.649" end="00:27:45.070" style="s2">at asking a genuine question and it</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.649" end="00:27:47.499" style="s2">could be like hey I I feel this weird</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.070" end="00:27:49.359" style="s2">energy in my chest when I hear that you</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.499" end="00:27:51.779" style="s2">trail off at the end of that sentence</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.359" end="00:27:54.609" style="s2">could you tell me what was there and</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.779" end="00:27:56.859" style="s2">like the way you ask the question it can</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.609" end="00:27:57.700" style="s2">completely shift the energy of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.859" end="00:28:00.609" style="s2">entire thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.700" end="00:28:02.769" style="s2">and like the way you ask the question is</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.609" end="00:28:05.679" style="s2">energetically telling them should they</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.769" end="00:28:07.330" style="s2">lie and hide or can they be comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.679" end="00:28:10.089" style="s2">sharing whatever the uncomfortable thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.330" end="00:28:13.809" style="s2">is yes that&#39;s the answer</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.089" end="00:28:15.999" style="s2">yeah beautiful well have been some of</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.809" end="00:28:18.909" style="s2">the hardest lessons you&#39;ve learned along</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.999" end="00:28:25.919" style="s2">the way to get to the point where you</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.909" end="00:28:25.919" style="s2">feel competent to answer such a question</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.450" end="00:28:42.670" style="s2">you know I don&#39;t know I think it really</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.690" end="00:28:44.110" style="s2">comes down to in college just the way it</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.670" end="00:28:45.700" style="s2">worked out is I would come home from</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.110" end="00:28:47.740" style="s2">school my friends would be in the garage</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.700" end="00:28:49.210" style="s2">smoking weed I would come in I&#39;d start</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.740" end="00:28:50.560" style="s2">smoking and they just started asking me</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.210" end="00:28:51.700" style="s2">questions about what I learned that day</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.560" end="00:28:54.430" style="s2">and I would just start to tell them what</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.700" end="00:28:56.140" style="s2">I learned and then it just it just grew</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.430" end="00:28:58.570" style="s2">into a thing where my friends asked me</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.140" end="00:29:00.750" style="s2">questions and now with social media I</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.570" end="00:29:05.170" style="s2">just let people ask me questions and</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.750" end="00:29:08.110" style="s2">because my guiding ethos is to the best</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.170" end="00:29:12.370" style="s2">of my ability speak and act my truth and</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.110" end="00:29:14.890" style="s2">love like ask me anything and I I will</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.370" end="00:29:17.500" style="s2">check in and I will feel what feels like</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.890" end="00:29:20.170" style="s2">my limit of what the thing is then I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.500" end="00:29:24.960" style="s2">just fucking say it and I&#39;ll just do it</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.170" end="00:29:28.690" style="s2">over and over and over and over and I</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.960" end="00:29:31.420" style="s2">think what lets me feel qualified to</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.690" end="00:29:33.700" style="s2">answer is that I think anyone is</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.420" end="00:29:35.770" style="s2">qualified to answer when it&#39;s regarding</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.700" end="00:29:36.720" style="s2">with their opinion is and so that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.770" end="00:29:39.760" style="s2">how I see it</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.720" end="00:29:43.260" style="s2">anyone can talk yes why I agree with</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.760" end="00:29:46.720" style="s2">that it&#39;s not so much a matter of of</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.260" end="00:29:51.130" style="s2">qualification but I think you I feel</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.720" end="00:29:51.820" style="s2">that that was very much an answer to my</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.130" end="00:29:53.380" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.820" end="00:29:56.410" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting because I&#39;m not exactly</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.380" end="00:30:00.580" style="s2">I am looking for answers to questions I</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.410" end="00:30:02.410" style="s2">suppose but really when I approached</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.580" end="00:30:03.940" style="s2">these conversations and conversations in</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.410" end="00:30:06.070" style="s2">general it&#39;s perhaps a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.940" end="00:30:08.260" style="s2">different over video there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.070" end="00:30:09.790" style="s2">bit of a time lag and I can&#39;t you know I</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.260" end="00:30:11.560" style="s2">can&#39;t see the rest of your body and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.790" end="00:30:12.940" style="s2">a little there&#39;s something more</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.560" end="00:30:16.120" style="s2">restrained about how we&#39;re doing this</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.940" end="00:30:17.140" style="s2">thing and that&#39;s fine and as this sort</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.120" end="00:30:19.000" style="s2">of incumbent life</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.140" end="00:30:22.590" style="s2">falls back to me to move the</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.000" end="00:30:25.240" style="s2">conversation on in ways where it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.590" end="00:30:26.980" style="s2">often when you&#39;re spending time with</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.240" end="00:30:29.800" style="s2">someone it&#39;s just good to it&#39;s nice just</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.980" end="00:30:35.800" style="s2">to stay silent for a bit this is perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.800" end="00:30:37.360" style="s2">a limitation of podcasts sure which is</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.800" end="00:30:39.630" style="s2">which is interesting isn&#39;t it and I</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.360" end="00:30:42.790" style="s2">think that&#39;s something I might</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.630" end="00:30:44.570" style="s2">experiment with a little bit in person</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.790" end="00:30:46.700" style="s2">it&#39;s a little bit easier</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.570" end="00:30:48.679" style="s2">to hold those moments of silence because</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.700" end="00:30:50.240" style="s2">the energy can be held a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.679" end="00:30:51.410" style="s2">whereas if I was to discuss silent right</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.240" end="00:30:53.510" style="s2">now and stay still you&#39;d be like is he</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.410" end="00:30:56.120" style="s2">freezing is he what like the quickness</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.510" end="00:30:58.520" style="s2">of the voice coming back in would be</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.120" end="00:31:03.080" style="s2">there but I might like to experiment</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.520" end="00:31:06.890" style="s2">with that someday how do you find how do</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.080" end="00:31:09.919" style="s2">you find podcasting in that in that</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.890" end="00:31:11.510" style="s2">regard is is there or just filming</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.919" end="00:31:14.000" style="s2">yourself in general there can be a real</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.510" end="00:31:16.280" style="s2">and for me getting a bit better at it</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.000" end="00:31:18.020" style="s2">but there is that flick it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.280" end="00:31:19.910" style="s2">not just you and me we are here right</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.020" end="00:31:22.270" style="s2">now like I&#39;m Jen you I am here with you</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.910" end="00:31:25.160" style="s2">I&#39;m here with your your pixelated face</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.270" end="00:31:28.970" style="s2">but but there&#39;s a bunch of other people</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.160" end="00:31:31.250" style="s2">here too in some sense and so whatever</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.970" end="00:31:33.559" style="s2">persona I&#39;ve developed to hold both the</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.250" end="00:31:37.580" style="s2">other people and you is what I&#39;m here</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.559" end="00:31:39.650" style="s2">with also and I wonder what the effect</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.580" end="00:31:45.250" style="s2">of that is when it comes to modeling</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.650" end="00:31:45.250" style="s2">interaction and communication in general</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.400" end="00:31:53.330" style="s2">there&#39;s a certain privacy that is that</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.429" end="00:31:56.080" style="s2">is not so simple to bring to bear even</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.330" end="00:31:58.700" style="s2">when you&#39;re pushing yourself for it</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.080" end="00:32:06.260" style="s2">what&#39;s so a question out of this might</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.700" end="00:32:08.380" style="s2">be something like mmm that is quite</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.260" end="00:32:13.160" style="s2">personal you don&#39;t have to answer it</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.380" end="00:32:15.760" style="s2">where are you when you are most private</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.160" end="00:32:15.760" style="s2">with yourself</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.920" end="00:32:21.190" style="s2">probably when I&#39;m looking in my eye in</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.200" end="00:32:22.300" style="s2">the mirror and maybe when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.190" end="00:32:24.680" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.300" end="00:32:25.310" style="s2">envisioning something when I&#39;m laying in</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.680" end="00:32:27.610" style="s2">bed at night</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.310" end="00:32:32.210" style="s2">that&#39;s probably my most private moments</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.610" end="00:32:34.700" style="s2">mm-hmm like I really feel like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.210" end="00:32:39.110" style="s2">God inside of me that is a reflection of</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.700" end="00:32:42.470" style="s2">whatever the total Spirit is that is my</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.110" end="00:32:46.390" style="s2">potential like that is at the edge of</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.470" end="00:32:50.570" style="s2">time and I feel it&#39;s inside of me and</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.390" end="00:32:53.510" style="s2">when I need help when I feel lost or</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.570" end="00:32:56.090" style="s2">when I just want to give thanks I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.510" end="00:32:58.870" style="s2">fuckin talk to that thing and I feel</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.090" end="00:33:01.860" style="s2">like those moments is when I&#39;m most</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.870" end="00:33:05.990" style="s2">private</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.860" end="00:33:08.130" style="s2">I saw of communion with higher self</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.990" end="00:33:10.380" style="s2">exactly yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.130" end="00:33:13.080" style="s2">I&#39;ve heard you mentioned thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.380" end="00:33:15.049" style="s2">sharing that I&#39;ve heard you mention I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.080" end="00:33:16.799" style="s2">and I as well I should say I&#39;m I</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.049" end="00:33:21.480" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t ask you anything I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.799" end="00:33:22.890" style="s2">willing to speak on myself yeah I would</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.480" end="00:33:26.340" style="s2">love to hear your answer for sure I</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.890" end="00:33:31.260" style="s2">think it&#39;s something very similar III</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.340" end="00:33:37.289" style="s2">think it it&#39;s any mode of expression</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.260" end="00:33:41.840" style="s2">where where you are in touch with your</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.289" end="00:33:45.779" style="s2">nature there&#39;s a and a nakedness to the</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.840" end="00:33:47.220" style="s2">second nakedness but a fullness I had an</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.779" end="00:33:50.580" style="s2">experience the other day and actually</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.220" end="00:33:53.549" style="s2">don&#39;t know this is something for me that</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.580" end="00:33:56.100" style="s2">to express this is like wow maybe maybe</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.549" end="00:33:58.440" style="s2">I shouldn&#39;t and so I was the best one</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.100" end="00:34:01.549" style="s2">yeah well I&#39;m gonna Pat it a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.440" end="00:34:06.179" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna Pat it a little bit but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.549" end="00:34:10.169" style="s2">because it&#39;s like I mean it relates to</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.179" end="00:34:13.230" style="s2">this notion of of contemplating or being</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.169" end="00:34:15.540" style="s2">with higher self in fact this particular</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.230" end="00:34:17.550" style="s2">experience was I&#39;ve done met different</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.540" end="00:34:18.690" style="s2">meditative practices before where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.550" end="00:34:20.429" style="s2">like imagine yourself in five years</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.690" end="00:34:22.649" style="s2">times like an older brother you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.429" end="00:34:24.540" style="s2">holding yourself you can take you can</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.649" end="00:34:26.520" style="s2">take yourself on the shoulder and give</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.540" end="00:34:28.379" style="s2">you that little bit of a smile and that</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.520" end="00:34:30.149" style="s2">sort of knowing look of you&#39;ve got this</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.379" end="00:34:32.190" style="s2">all right yeah I know it&#39;s tough I know</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.149" end="00:34:33.899" style="s2">it&#39;s difficult I know you&#39;re confused</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.190" end="00:34:36.359" style="s2">but you have it you have that you have</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.899" end="00:34:38.609" style="s2">that fire in you you will you got it</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.359" end="00:34:43.050" style="s2">mate it&#39;s all good and then it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.609" end="00:34:46.050" style="s2">all right how about an image of that</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.050" end="00:34:49.800" style="s2">five years 10 years 15 years 20 years 5</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.050" end="00:34:51.359" style="s2">years ago 10 years ago and all its</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.800" end="00:34:57.210" style="s2">different manifestations of what you</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.359" end="00:35:01.530" style="s2">could be and then were image coalesce is</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.210" end="00:35:05.670" style="s2">all of those together sort of an image</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.530" end="00:35:08.040" style="s2">of the the confluence of these that is</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.670" end="00:35:10.080" style="s2">somehow it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s a self that</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.040" end="00:35:14.970" style="s2">transcends all of them across all</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.080" end="00:35:19.859" style="s2">possible manifestations is the</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.970" end="00:35:22.080" style="s2">you&#39;ll form and you know maybe I won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.859" end="00:35:24.900" style="s2">say just yet exactly how that image</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.080" end="00:35:28.619" style="s2">appears to me but that image is there</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.900" end="00:35:29.670" style="s2">and it reminds me of of what you what</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.619" end="00:35:32.010" style="s2">you mention here there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.670" end="00:35:35.010" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a capacity to check in</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.010" end="00:35:37.349" style="s2">and it is a sort of loving truth it is a</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.010" end="00:35:40.080" style="s2">sort of that it&#39;s a sort of affirmation</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.349" end="00:35:42.920" style="s2">of the potential and possibility and</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.080" end="00:35:46.140" style="s2">wonder of life as much as it is a an</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.920" end="00:35:49.109" style="s2">inclusion and and acceptance of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.140" end="00:35:50.670" style="s2">suffering and the difficulty but an</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.109" end="00:35:53.700" style="s2">affirmation nevertheless and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.670" end="00:35:57.030" style="s2">something to tap into can be with it</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.700" end="00:35:58.950" style="s2">it&#39;s like how do you read what is the</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.030" end="00:36:01.200" style="s2">mechanism by which yuria tend when</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.950" end="00:36:04.580" style="s2">you&#39;re dropped into the ocean I would</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.200" end="00:36:06.960" style="s2">say it&#39;s these moments of stepping into</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.580" end="00:36:08.450" style="s2">novelty it&#39;s that creative space of</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.960" end="00:36:13.530" style="s2">stepping over the boundary</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.450" end="00:36:15.869" style="s2">perhaps there perhaps there you perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.530" end="00:36:17.970" style="s2">there it&#39;s um it&#39;s a it&#39;s a moment of</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.869" end="00:36:23.099" style="s2">reckoning perhaps these are perhaps this</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.970" end="00:36:24.510" style="s2">is the most private moment for me well I</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.099" end="00:36:26.430" style="s2">mean it&#39;s something I wasn&#39;t willing to</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.510" end="00:36:30.900" style="s2">precisely share as much as I could and I</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.430" end="00:36:32.220" style="s2">would with you just individually so but</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.900" end="00:36:33.930" style="s2">but this but this brings something up</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.220" end="00:36:36.510" style="s2">else to me as well and I think perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.930" end="00:36:39.000" style="s2">you can help me with this it&#39;s like I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.510" end="00:36:42.750" style="s2">mentioned it a few times on the podcast</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.000" end="00:36:46.020" style="s2">before and in different ways so when we</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.750" end="00:36:48.810" style="s2">are speaking our truth okay there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.020" end="00:36:51.599" style="s2">container that forms between us and I</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.810" end="00:36:53.010" style="s2">can trust you to hold that but when the</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.599" end="00:36:55.140" style="s2">content and then maybe the containers</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.010" end="00:36:57.240" style="s2">never totally set maybe I don&#39;t ever</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.140" end="00:37:00.720" style="s2">totally know and there is that faith in</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.240" end="00:37:03.570" style="s2">it in trusting being held when you are</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.720" end="00:37:05.010" style="s2">speaking to many others when you are in</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.570" end="00:37:07.560" style="s2">a place where you&#39;re not so sure there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.010" end="00:37:09.810" style="s2">a sense in which there is more at stake</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.560" end="00:37:11.680" style="s2">right there&#39;s an expression don&#39;t cast</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.810" end="00:37:15.460" style="s2">pearls before swine</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.680" end="00:37:17.350" style="s2">right there&#39;s a sort sort of you know if</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.460" end="00:37:19.990" style="s2">if if what you if what you put out there</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.350" end="00:37:21.730" style="s2">is not held maybe it&#39;s being eaten a</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.990" end="00:37:23.650" style="s2">little bit maybe your energy is being</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.730" end="00:37:26.320" style="s2">taken somehow and I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.650" end="00:37:32.260" style="s2">I wonder what comes up for you then yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.320" end="00:37:34.750" style="s2">um a distinction between because it is</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.260" end="00:37:38.590" style="s2">my truth does not mean it must be shared</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.750" end="00:37:41.230" style="s2">and my truth could be right now I feel</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.590" end="00:37:43.630" style="s2">that if I gave you know this audience</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.230" end="00:37:45.100" style="s2">advice it would not be accepted and so</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.630" end="00:37:47.170" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna choose not to share it that</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.100" end="00:37:50.170" style="s2">would be my truth in that moment so</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.170" end="00:37:52.750" style="s2">simply because it is thought does not</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.170" end="00:37:54.250" style="s2">mean that it must be expressed and for</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.750" end="00:37:57.760" style="s2">example like if someone tells me a</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.250" end="00:38:03.610" style="s2">secret but somebody else asks me did X</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.760" end="00:38:05.290" style="s2">do why my truth is I&#39;m I would feel</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.610" end="00:38:07.210" style="s2">wrong being a part of this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.290" end="00:38:10.780" style="s2">between you two I think you should go</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.210" end="00:38:13.450" style="s2">talk to them you know like so truth does</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.780" end="00:38:16.720" style="s2">not mean it must be divulged and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.450" end="00:38:19.990" style="s2">why I think there&#39;s endless nuance</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.720" end="00:38:21.820" style="s2">inside of us as we cultivate more</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.990" end="00:38:25.630" style="s2">awareness and you can start to feel the</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.820" end="00:38:28.990" style="s2">shades and the different hues around</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.630" end="00:38:34.120" style="s2">your feelings and the truth might be</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.990" end="00:38:37.270" style="s2">something like I don&#39;t feel that I am</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.120" end="00:38:38.470" style="s2">yet able to articulate this in truth and</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.270" end="00:38:40.000" style="s2">so I&#39;m going to think about it for a</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.470" end="00:38:42.010" style="s2">couple of days and I will get back to</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.000" end="00:38:44.800" style="s2">you you know like all of those are</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.010" end="00:38:46.120" style="s2">examples of how you can speak your truth</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.800" end="00:38:49.120" style="s2">in the moment it doesn&#39;t mean that you</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.120" end="00:38:54.220" style="s2">have to give birth to a child that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.120" end="00:38:57.730" style="s2">ready yeah beautiful so that is and god</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.220" end="00:38:59.800" style="s2">I feel that is a that is a constant less</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.730" end="00:39:02.500" style="s2">than a constant practice to learn and</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.800" end="00:39:05.050" style="s2">it&#39;s one that in some sense as well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.500" end="00:39:06.430" style="s2">like God you do all the preparation you</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.050" end="00:39:08.020" style="s2">want but it&#39;s like eventually you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.430" end="00:39:09.820" style="s2">still stepping out there you&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.020" end="00:39:11.470" style="s2">stepping out into the unknown and this</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.820" end="00:39:14.460" style="s2">is that this is the paradox you in some</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.470" end="00:39:16.309" style="s2">sense for all the preparation</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.460" end="00:39:18.329" style="s2">it&#39;s not a knowing in advance</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.309" end="00:39:22.319" style="s2">necessarily right so it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.329" end="00:39:26.130" style="s2">cultivation of a toolkit absolutely men</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.319" end="00:39:28.800" style="s2">like I spent a lot of my life</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.130" end="00:39:31.410" style="s2">preparing for life and now I feel like a</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.800" end="00:39:33.930" style="s2">lot of my life is living life and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.410" end="00:39:36.480" style="s2">grateful for the tools but you still</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.930" end="00:39:38.910" style="s2">gotta fucking feel the fields and go</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.480" end="00:39:42.240" style="s2">through the things and the trials and</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.910" end="00:39:44.970" style="s2">the fire and nothing is going to hone</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.240" end="00:39:48.300" style="s2">you like the actual experiences yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.970" end="00:39:51.270" style="s2">books or Maps mm-hmm experiences or the</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.300" end="00:39:54.900" style="s2">forest mm-hmm yeah beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.270" end="00:39:57.180" style="s2">I find this well that I mean it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.900" end="00:40:01.940" style="s2">it&#39;s the practice of your own expression</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.180" end="00:40:06.329" style="s2">so I do read you know I&#39;ve read a bit</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.940" end="00:40:10.800" style="s2">but but to be honest with you I find</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.329" end="00:40:12.450" style="s2">that if I&#39;m not I feel it&#39;s the working</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.800" end="00:40:15.599" style="s2">through it&#39;s the it&#39;s the expression</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.450" end="00:40:18.480" style="s2">through of the ideas its cultivating my</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.599" end="00:40:20.579" style="s2">own interest actually that I doing most</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.480" end="00:40:22.380" style="s2">of the learning and and the teaching in</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.579" end="00:40:24.809" style="s2">this way I mean up not getting facts</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.380" end="00:40:28.559" style="s2">from other places but in terms of in</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.809" end="00:40:30.420" style="s2">terms of developing the scaffolding your</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.559" end="00:40:32.010" style="s2">concerns will framework but then also</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.420" end="00:40:33.839" style="s2">the link between the concept and the</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.010" end="00:40:35.490" style="s2">feeling this is the really difficult</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.839" end="00:40:36.720" style="s2">thing about young to grasp I think for</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.490" end="00:40:39.270" style="s2">many people it&#39;s like someone could ask</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.720" end="00:40:40.770" style="s2">me okay what&#39;s what&#39;s an archetype how</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.270" end="00:40:42.630" style="s2">do we understand that it&#39;s like a sort</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.770" end="00:40:44.010" style="s2">of like Plato&#39;s forms or something like</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.630" end="00:40:45.930" style="s2">this but it&#39;s not quite that and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.010" end="00:40:50.819" style="s2">like well one of the challenging things</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.930" end="00:40:53.790" style="s2">is that it and maybe this is why it mean</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.819" end="00:40:57.540" style="s2">it&#39;s a young&#39;uns do psychotherapy right</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.790" end="00:40:59.369" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s the concept but then</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.540" end="00:41:01.319" style="s2">there&#39;s its manifestation in your actual</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.369" end="00:41:03.030" style="s2">life right there&#39;s the living out of</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.319" end="00:41:04.200" style="s2">that archetype and in some sense if</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.030" end="00:41:07.140" style="s2">you&#39;re not in touch with the lived</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.200" end="00:41:10.260" style="s2">reality of it it can begin to name these</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.140" end="00:41:12.420" style="s2">different energetic confluences as they</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.260" end="00:41:14.849" style="s2">are relevant to the narrative and</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.420" end="00:41:18.089" style="s2">ongoing narrative of your life how then</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.849" end="00:41:20.730" style="s2">to begin to really grasp things like the</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.089" end="00:41:23.250" style="s2">shadow or the animal or the self or any</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.730" end="00:41:25.440" style="s2">number of these more minor archetypes as</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.250" end="00:41:27.119" style="s2">well so that&#39;s one of the challenging</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.440" end="00:41:28.020" style="s2">things it&#39;s the balance right it&#39;s both</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.119" end="00:41:32.580" style="s2">the conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.020" end="00:41:37.710" style="s2">and the feeling how do you how do you</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.580" end="00:41:42.180" style="s2">did you do do you is it is it an</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.710" end="00:41:46.710" style="s2">aspiration of yours to to what to</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.180" end="00:41:51.089" style="s2">undergo that that personal work with</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.710" end="00:42:03.150" style="s2">with people because I am how what do you</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.089" end="00:42:09.180" style="s2">mean specifically I feel I feel often</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.150" end="00:42:14.490" style="s2">when being truthful with people by</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.180" end="00:42:17.400" style="s2">anything important there has to be a</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.490" end="00:42:20.640" style="s2">trust there that that&#39;s actually what is</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.400" end="00:42:22.830" style="s2">wanted that that&#39;s that we&#39;re willing to</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.640" end="00:42:24.900" style="s2">go there together and if I can just tell</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.830" end="00:42:27.180" style="s2">a story real quick I don&#39;t know this is</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.900" end="00:42:29.460" style="s2">you know I&#39;m a bit all over the place</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.180" end="00:42:32.849" style="s2">but I&#39;m coalescing something I&#39;ve I feel</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.460" end="00:42:34.470" style="s2">perhaps is it is interesting it relates</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.849" end="00:42:37.200" style="s2">to the to what we&#39;ve been speaking about</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.470" end="00:42:39.980" style="s2">I once had an experience and I&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.200" end="00:42:42.210" style="s2">to leave out some details for privacy</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.980" end="00:42:44.670" style="s2">but once had an experience I&#39;ve had a</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.210" end="00:42:49.530" style="s2">few like this I was talking to someone</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.670" end="00:42:51.780" style="s2">who was on some LSD and maybe they had</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.530" end="00:42:54.000" style="s2">taken a few other substances earlier in</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.780" end="00:42:57.570" style="s2">a day or so I&#39;m pretty sure LSD was the</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.000" end="00:43:00.270" style="s2">main thing and I was sober but this you</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.570" end="00:43:02.339" style="s2">know is after sort of a number of years</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.270" end="00:43:05.460" style="s2">of exploration and and integration on my</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.339" end="00:43:07.170" style="s2">part and there&#39;s a certain awareness I</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.460" end="00:43:09.300" style="s2">can take up in relationship to someone</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.170" end="00:43:11.190" style="s2">on these experiences I can sort of drop</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.300" end="00:43:12.390" style="s2">into a bit of the shared resonation so</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.190" end="00:43:13.609" style="s2">we were trapped we were tracking each</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.390" end="00:43:16.530" style="s2">other very well</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.609" end="00:43:20.540" style="s2">we were speaking about DMT we were</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.530" end="00:43:23.910" style="s2">speaking about the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.540" end="00:43:27.080" style="s2">the DMT experience but also what occurs</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.910" end="00:43:29.760" style="s2">in your life and again this link between</p>

<p begin="00:43:50.970" end="00:43:55.290" style="s2">stepped out a little bit and I said</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.230" end="00:43:59.040" style="s2">something and then we were tracking each</p>

<p begin="00:44:18.450" end="00:44:24.660" style="s2">from this the idea that someone&#39;s cup</p>

<p begin="00:44:24.660" end="00:44:28.590" style="s2">expression perhaps of a certain truth</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.280" end="00:44:30.300" style="s2">that one is not ready for like for</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.590" end="00:44:31.710" style="s2">example with a child when do you express</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.300" end="00:44:36.690" style="s2">to them certain things about the nature</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.710" end="00:44:37.860" style="s2">of the world when do we it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:44:40.890" end="00:44:48.540" style="s2">how how you feel like your own</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.520" end="00:44:50.400" style="s2">development when do you know like when</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.540" end="00:44:52.140" style="s2">do you feel when do you know it is</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.400" end="00:44:54.420" style="s2">appropriate or you are ready to engage</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.140" end="00:44:56.130" style="s2">in a certain kind of like genuinely</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.420" end="00:44:57.660" style="s2">transformative reaction interaction</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.130" end="00:45:00.060" style="s2">people can think of shamans right like</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.660" end="00:45:02.160" style="s2">when are you ready to have to take on</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.060" end="00:45:03.990" style="s2">that role and I feel like perhaps Pete a</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.160" end="00:45:09.000" style="s2">lot of people step into that far far far</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.990" end="00:45:14.400" style="s2">too soon so this is something that I for</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.000" end="00:45:16.560" style="s2">sure probably don&#39;t do well it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.400" end="00:45:18.480" style="s2">known amongst my family in my friend</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.560" end="00:45:20.550" style="s2">group like beware if you call Eric</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.480" end="00:45:23.850" style="s2">because I don&#39;t do it on purpose but</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.550" end="00:45:26.640" style="s2">like it&#39;s like there&#39;s this wolf in me</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.850" end="00:45:29.310" style="s2">that can smell if there&#39;s a hi if</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.640" end="00:45:32.360" style="s2">there&#39;s truth being hidden and it wants</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.310" end="00:45:36.660" style="s2">to ask about this truth and if I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.360" end="00:45:39.240" style="s2">if I&#39;m not emotionally calm like if I</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.660" end="00:45:41.460" style="s2">get anxious or angry that wolf will</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.240" end="00:45:43.770" style="s2">force a conversation that probably is</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.460" end="00:45:46.920" style="s2">not ready to be had mm-hmm and something</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.770" end="00:45:50.220" style="s2">that a trained therapist will be taught</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.920" end="00:45:53.280" style="s2">is you might be able to smell the</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.220" end="00:45:54.150" style="s2">person&#39;s problem the first day you are</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.280" end="00:45:56.670" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.150" end="00:45:58.589" style="s2">truth and love if you let them know on</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.670" end="00:46:00.809" style="s2">the first day that their husband&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.589" end="00:46:05.369" style="s2">cheating on them or that their sons gay</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.809" end="00:46:09.539" style="s2">or whatever it is like your your role is</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.369" end="00:46:14.569" style="s2">to gently ask questions and slowly help</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.539" end="00:46:16.829" style="s2">them be able to see it themselves yes</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.569" end="00:46:19.009" style="s2">but there&#39;s also a part of that that I</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.829" end="00:46:21.960" style="s2">don&#39;t like because a part of that feels</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.009" end="00:46:24.210" style="s2">manipulative on my part like who am i hi</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.960" end="00:46:27.630" style="s2">to choose whether or not you&#39;re ready</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.210" end="00:46:29.329" style="s2">for this truth and so again it feels</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.630" end="00:46:33.180" style="s2">like it comes down to this gut feeling</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.329" end="00:46:35.160" style="s2">mm-hmm and truly the way to do this is</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.180" end="00:46:36.900" style="s2">to not talk to someone like you&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.160" end="00:46:39.150" style="s2">one in power and for it to be amongst</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.900" end="00:46:41.789" style="s2">equals and both parties agree that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.150" end="00:46:43.829" style="s2">gonna be in our truth and if I ask you a</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.789" end="00:46:47.460" style="s2">question for you to feel comfortable to</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.829" end="00:46:49.230" style="s2">say my truth is right now I feel in my</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.460" end="00:46:52.380" style="s2">body that I&#39;m not ready to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.230" end="00:46:58.440" style="s2">this and then and then we can move on</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.380" end="00:47:00.480" style="s2">from that point I think the beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.440" end="00:47:02.670" style="s2">thing about this sort of stuff is like</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.480" end="00:47:05.099" style="s2">the real world does not have black and</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.670" end="00:47:07.529" style="s2">white lines like the like human</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.099" end="00:47:10.680" style="s2">experience between two humans is not a</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.529" end="00:47:14.369" style="s2">black or white thing and so a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.680" end="00:47:17.339" style="s2">this is feeling and the way we learn is</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.369" end="00:47:19.799" style="s2">to do and we tend to fuck up and so like</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.339" end="00:47:22.170" style="s2">you will learn by doing mm-hmm and</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.799" end="00:47:26.730" style="s2">you&#39;ll just get a better and a better</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.170" end="00:47:29.039" style="s2">sense of is this the place to say the</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.730" end="00:47:31.249" style="s2">truth and love or is this the place to</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.039" end="00:47:34.079" style="s2">just be and love just a hold space for</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.249" end="00:47:36.269" style="s2">is this the space just to be quiet and</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.079" end="00:47:38.460" style="s2">to make eye contact is this the space</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.269" end="00:47:41.759" style="s2">just a hug you know is this the space to</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.460" end="00:47:43.349" style="s2">make the a joke mm-hmm a thing that I</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.759" end="00:47:45.839" style="s2">know that I have a hard time doing is I</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.349" end="00:47:47.609" style="s2">have a hard time joking because I&#39;m so</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.839" end="00:47:49.769" style="s2">interested in only speaking the truth</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.609" end="00:47:51.900" style="s2">that it kind of fucks with my ability to</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.769" end="00:47:54.329" style="s2">make jokes and that&#39;s something that I</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.900" end="00:47:57.829" style="s2">feel like I&#39;m trying to work on and to</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.329" end="00:47:59.940" style="s2">cultivate that&#39;s pretty funny right and</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.829" end="00:48:03.450" style="s2">I&#39;m just trying to find that balance</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.940" end="00:48:06.119" style="s2">especially being in a relationship now</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.450" end="00:48:07.410" style="s2">where I&#39;m monogamous and I feel deeply</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.119" end="00:48:10.289" style="s2">committed to one person</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.410" end="00:48:12.059" style="s2">like it can be exhausting talking to</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.289" end="00:48:14.160" style="s2">someone like me every day and so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.059" end="00:48:16.680" style="s2">trying to find more ways to be playful</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.160" end="00:48:19.529" style="s2">and to like be humorous and just to</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.680" end="00:48:22.289" style="s2">bring some levity interactions because</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.529" end="00:48:33.420" style="s2">imagine having a talk like this every</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.289" end="00:48:38.099" style="s2">fucking day actually yeah yeah no I hear</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.420" end="00:48:40.769" style="s2">you man as the the lightness the the</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.099" end="00:48:43.650" style="s2">relate did you know the the levity and</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.769" end="00:48:47.369" style="s2">the depth I have to go hand in hand or</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.650" end="00:48:49.769" style="s2">you&#39;re out of balance I find I should</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.369" end="00:48:55.440" style="s2">say I find I know I am when they are out</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.769" end="00:48:56.819" style="s2">out of hand and yeah it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.440" end="00:48:59.069" style="s2">beautiful thing it&#39;s a beautiful thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.819" end="00:49:05.519" style="s2">to switch to switch between them</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.069" end="00:49:10.759" style="s2">I enjoy relationships where there can be</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.519" end="00:49:14.400" style="s2">such stark jumps from one to another</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.759" end="00:49:18.720" style="s2">without yeah absolutely yeah without the</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.400" end="00:49:20.160" style="s2">degradation of either one and if you</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.720" end="00:49:22.650" style="s2">know in fact just coming to me there it</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.160" end="00:49:25.500" style="s2">might be the case that if those jumps</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.650" end="00:49:28.230" style="s2">aren&#39;t possible then actually there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.500" end="00:49:30.000" style="s2">something there&#39;s something there maybe</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.230" end="00:49:31.500" style="s2">inside you maybe inside there maybe</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.000" end="00:49:33.450" style="s2">something unspoken be a million things</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.500" end="00:49:35.400" style="s2">but there&#39;s something there that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.450" end="00:49:37.140" style="s2">triggered yourself somehow and you need</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.400" end="00:49:38.549" style="s2">to attend to something actually a little</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.140" end="00:49:40.799" style="s2">bit of an insecurity at least talking</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.549" end="00:49:42.869" style="s2">from my own perspective of well it</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.799" end="00:49:46.650" style="s2">wasn&#39;t quite ready for that it&#39;s funny</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.869" end="00:49:48.180" style="s2">it&#39;s funny it links up with another you</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.650" end="00:49:51.210" style="s2">know a bit of a tangent by a link start</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.180" end="00:49:53.099" style="s2">with this idea of and the more one</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.210" end="00:49:55.500" style="s2">cultivates awareness the more one takes</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.099" end="00:49:56.849" style="s2">on responsibility and it&#39;s got there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.500" end="00:49:58.349" style="s2">link there between awareness and</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.849" end="00:50:01.319" style="s2">responsibility right because all of a</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.349" end="00:50:02.700" style="s2">sudden your containers bigger than to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.319" end="00:50:04.079" style="s2">in a sort of loving truthful</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.700" end="00:50:05.819" style="s2">relationship with it to be in a</p>

<p begin="00:50:07.799" end="00:50:12.539" style="s2">network is that much more salient it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.559" end="00:50:14.400" style="s2">more developmental and so that</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.539" end="00:50:16.769" style="s2">responsibility increases and with that</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.400" end="00:50:18.359" style="s2">responsibility with that awareness there</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.769" end="00:50:24.009" style="s2">comes</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.359" end="00:50:25.900" style="s2">proportional distance to fall which is</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.009" end="00:50:28.799" style="s2">an interesting one and maybe you had the</p>

<p begin="00:51:57.309" end="00:52:01.749" style="s2">certain vulnerability in this you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.680" end="00:52:03.849" style="s2">also been taking a few psychedelics here</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.749" end="00:52:07.599" style="s2">and there that have been important parts</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.849" end="00:52:09.160" style="s2">of your your journey what can I ask you</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.599" end="00:52:16.390" style="s2">about psychedelics I feel there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.160" end="00:52:18.849" style="s2">so much stuff to discuss have you has</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.390" end="00:52:23.920" style="s2">been something in your psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.849" end="00:52:26.589" style="s2">experience where it&#39;s still in that box</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.920" end="00:52:28.750" style="s2">of oh shit I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.589" end="00:52:31.119" style="s2">about integrating this one that is like</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.750" end="00:52:34.059" style="s2">what&#39;s going on there I&#39;ve maybe bitten</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.119" end="00:52:35.920" style="s2">into that like one two percent and it</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.059" end="00:52:38.289" style="s2">has their business what what is that</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.920" end="00:52:41.529" style="s2">thing for you how what are you if you</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.289" end="00:52:45.849" style="s2">were to consider like just taking an</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.529" end="00:52:49.779" style="s2">extra step forward into coalescing some</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.849" end="00:52:51.190" style="s2">of the more profoundly novel experiences</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.779" end="00:52:56.349" style="s2">you&#39;ve had in any of your psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.190" end="00:53:00.490" style="s2">journeys what would come to mind the</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.349" end="00:53:03.279" style="s2">hardest thing for me to grasp on a</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.490" end="00:53:07.359" style="s2">psychedelic that I said I just I know</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.279" end="00:53:10.450" style="s2">that I haven&#39;t integrated is there is</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.359" end="00:53:16.799" style="s2">this feeling that whatever the truth of</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.450" end="00:53:24.039" style="s2">reality is I will only be capable of</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.799" end="00:53:26.789" style="s2">digesting it at the moment I die yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.039" end="00:53:30.789" style="s2">and there&#39;s this feeling that I know</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.789" end="00:53:33.309" style="s2">that I am inside of the illusion that</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.789" end="00:53:35.049" style="s2">I&#39;m doing my best to be in my truth to</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.309" end="00:53:37.509" style="s2">the best of my ability because that is</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.049" end="00:53:40.509" style="s2">the way that I know or feel is the most</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.509" end="00:53:43.240" style="s2">gracious way to be in the illusion but</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.509" end="00:53:47.769" style="s2">that the immensity of whatever this</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.240" end="00:53:53.440" style="s2">thing is I do not possess the power or</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.769" end="00:53:56.829" style="s2">the ability to comprehend it but I feel</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.440" end="00:54:02.829" style="s2">like at the moment of my death I will be</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.829" end="00:54:05.440" style="s2">like oh so that&#39;s the biggest one from</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.829" end="00:54:07.930" style="s2">psychedelics I don&#39;t count</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.440" end="00:54:12.130" style="s2">edible marijuana as a psychedelic but my</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.930" end="00:54:15.460" style="s2">worst trips my hardest trips come from</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.130" end="00:54:17.859" style="s2">way too much of an edible and the ideas</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.460" end="00:54:20.380" style="s2">that come from that that I just can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.859" end="00:54:22.029" style="s2">shake then a part of me I and I I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.380" end="00:54:25.329" style="s2">know if it&#39;s my truth or if it&#39;s a fear</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.029" end="00:54:27.519" style="s2">thing plain as truth but on psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.329" end="00:54:29.980" style="s2">I can see instantly come up against the</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.519" end="00:54:33.280" style="s2">idea of you</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.980" end="00:54:36.579" style="s2">are an illusion everything in your life</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.280" end="00:54:39.599" style="s2">is an illusion and you&#39;re either in a</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.579" end="00:54:43.030" style="s2">coma and you&#39;re making all this up or</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.599" end="00:54:46.810" style="s2">you&#39;re in a simulation and this is just</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.030" end="00:54:50.680" style="s2">simply not real but both of those feel</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.810" end="00:54:53.170" style="s2">like my mind creating a story to justify</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.680" end="00:54:55.690" style="s2">the fact that I feel disoriented from</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.170" end="00:54:58.119" style="s2">how high I am and my mind automatically</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.690" end="00:55:00.640" style="s2">generates the most intense story to</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.119" end="00:55:04.440" style="s2">justify why I feel the amount of fear</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.640" end="00:55:10.150" style="s2">that I feel yeah oh because ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.440" end="00:55:13.599" style="s2">my my metaphysical question is always if</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.150" end="00:55:16.060" style="s2">so then what and if either of those are</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.599" end="00:55:18.310" style="s2">real and I can&#39;t do anything so I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.060" end="00:55:19.810" style="s2">gonna live my life I&#39;m gonna be in truth</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.310" end="00:55:21.190" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna try to love people I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.810" end="00:55:23.050" style="s2">try to be of service to the world I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.190" end="00:55:27.270" style="s2">gonna try to help I&#39;m gonna have orgasms</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.050" end="00:55:31.300" style="s2">and eat good food hmm yeah beautiful me</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.270" end="00:55:33.010" style="s2">the questioning process is is but the</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.300" end="00:55:38.280" style="s2">participation in the transformative</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.010" end="00:55:40.930" style="s2">cycle it is our the inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.280" end="00:55:43.980" style="s2">it&#39;s that revolution between stepping</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.930" end="00:55:47.670" style="s2">into novelty and the integration of it</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.980" end="00:55:49.359" style="s2">attachment and detachment it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.670" end="00:55:51.700" style="s2">simulation or not I mean it is a</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.359" end="00:55:54.819" style="s2">simulation but we participate in a</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.700" end="00:56:02.520" style="s2">simulation the reality is the process of</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.819" end="00:56:05.440" style="s2">transformation and it&#39;s there&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.520" end="00:56:10.420" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a light as anything and</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.440" end="00:56:13.980" style="s2">deep as all hell at the same time that</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.420" end="00:56:20.700" style="s2">first comment you made about their</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.980" end="00:56:25.839" style="s2">apprehension only possible on death hmm</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.700" end="00:56:27.790" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting right because death is</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.839" end="00:56:30.190" style="s2">often used metaphorically it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.790" end="00:56:31.750" style="s2">death and rebirth fucking death and</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.190" end="00:56:34.119" style="s2">rebirth this dynast I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.750" end="00:56:36.150" style="s2">myself a death and rebirth that and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.119" end="00:56:42.120" style="s2">like yeah death of</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.150" end="00:56:44.550" style="s2">some sort of narrative particular map of</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.120" end="00:56:51.330" style="s2">coherence particular framework of</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.550" end="00:56:55.530" style="s2">fixation and then the the re-imagination</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.330" end="00:57:00.020" style="s2">and the recapturing of another frame</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.530" end="00:57:03.240" style="s2">that rebirth again and what is that</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.020" end="00:57:07.410" style="s2">there&#39;s that there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.240" end="00:57:10.020" style="s2">that like like the real deal like that</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.410" end="00:57:12.740" style="s2">the physical death - I mean I it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.020" end="00:57:15.350" style="s2">hmm</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.740" end="00:57:17.490" style="s2">how much I mean let&#39;s talk about</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.350" end="00:57:20.070" style="s2">psychedelics and spiritual practice and</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.490" end="00:57:24.570" style="s2">philosophy even being a preparation for</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.070" end="00:57:28.320" style="s2">death and it seems to me it is it seems</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.570" end="00:57:33.860" style="s2">to me that but you can only say maybe</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.320" end="00:57:39.930" style="s2">and it&#39;s only a seeming that we touch</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.860" end="00:57:43.320" style="s2">death in transformation but at that</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.930" end="00:57:45.420" style="s2">point it is a it&#39;s not something that</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.320" end="00:57:47.940" style="s2">can be referred to as as a death is not</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.420" end="00:57:51.090" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s not something which</p>

<p begin="00:58:37.140" end="00:58:41.670" style="s2">back from it and at that we are just</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.360" end="00:58:44.130" style="s2">referring to some sort of you know like</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.670" end="00:58:46.620" style="s2">what sort of image the soul leaving the</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.130" end="00:58:49.349" style="s2">world but it&#39;s like we only have</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.620" end="00:58:51.209" style="s2">psychological images to make sense</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.349" end="00:58:53.309" style="s2">and we don&#39;t get outside of it and in</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.209" end="00:58:55.650" style="s2">this sense we are just though we are a</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.309" end="00:58:57.390" style="s2">fragmentary source of divinity but we</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.650" end="00:59:00.390" style="s2">are not the God outside of things we are</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.390" end="00:59:03.119" style="s2">not outside of we are very much a part</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.390" end="00:59:05.309" style="s2">of and engaging in these processes of</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.119" end="00:59:08.069" style="s2">transformation and but but but to say</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.309" end="00:59:11.279" style="s2">all this as well it&#39;s like I do my best</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.069" end="00:59:13.739" style="s2">to check in and be honest but but even</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.279" end="00:59:16.440" style="s2">this of course is just language course</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.739" end="00:59:17.910" style="s2">is just expression mad fucking shingles</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.440" end="00:59:19.559" style="s2">I was still I&#39;m coming off the end of</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.910" end="00:59:21.180" style="s2">having shingles which is like an adult</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.559" end="00:59:23.910" style="s2">version of chickenpox and I had them</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.180" end="00:59:26.069" style="s2">around the back of my back through my</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.910" end="00:59:28.109" style="s2">thigh like right up alongside my balls</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.069" end="00:59:30.449" style="s2">which is particularly interesting</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.109" end="00:59:32.670" style="s2">because it seemed like to stimulate the</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.449" end="00:59:33.779" style="s2">exact nerve that is stimulated when you</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.670" end="00:59:36.989" style="s2">get kicked in the balls</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.779" end="00:59:38.819" style="s2">so Felicity like 72 hours I was getting</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.989" end="00:59:45.660" style="s2">kicked in the balls everything 30</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.819" end="00:59:48.809" style="s2">seconds kind of like alright this is the</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.660" end="00:59:51.180" style="s2">reality now I just accept it and I&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.809" end="00:59:52.949" style="s2">this other place I don&#39;t know where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.180" end="00:59:55.559" style="s2">going with that exactly but it&#39;s like I</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.949" end="00:59:59.009" style="s2">don&#39;t know like what do we have the</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.559" end="01:00:02.539" style="s2">power like what what is people can hold</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.009" end="01:00:05.099" style="s2">so much we are so capable of of</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.539" end="01:00:07.249" style="s2">acceptance like a radical acceptance of</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.099" end="01:00:10.469" style="s2">the conditions of life yet still somehow</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.249" end="01:00:12.449" style="s2">the trajectory towards love the</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.469" end="01:00:16.229" style="s2">trajectory towards acceptance and being</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.449" end="01:00:18.119" style="s2">available as you are and an acceptance</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.229" end="01:00:20.009" style="s2">of the quality of the potential of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.119" end="01:00:22.499" style="s2">beauty of things remains and this is</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.009" end="01:00:26.219" style="s2">such a remarkable is the kind of thing</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.499" end="01:00:29.430" style="s2">that you know it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.219" end="01:00:31.529" style="s2">tear-jerking it&#39;s so incredible that</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.430" end="01:00:38.119" style="s2">that people have the capacity to do</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.529" end="01:00:41.219" style="s2">these things and we we and we all have</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.119" end="01:00:44.459" style="s2">we all have mountains to climb and then</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.219" end="01:00:45.839" style="s2">we all deal with the precipice and then</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.459" end="01:00:48.119" style="s2">sometimes we&#39;re floating down the river</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.839" end="01:00:50.459" style="s2">and that&#39;s movie that&#39;s maybe the best</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.119" end="01:00:52.559" style="s2">part of it but man sometimes it&#39;s not so</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.459" end="01:00:55.259" style="s2">much of a float sometimes it&#39;s like fuck</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.559" end="01:00:58.170" style="s2">me I just got swooped on by an eagle as</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.259" end="01:01:08.220" style="s2">I smashed into a log bulls first but</p>

<p begin="01:01:20.250" end="01:01:27.900" style="s2">time my life has taken so many shifts</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.450" end="01:01:30.779" style="s2">and bits of development and some some</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.900" end="01:01:34.319" style="s2">really challenging dark moments and then</p>
