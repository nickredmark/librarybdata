<p begin="00:01:27.270" end="00:01:34.240" style="s2">planet and that this planet is traveling</p>

<p begin="00:05:38.140" end="00:05:43.440" style="s2">and we&#39;re beginning to see the</p>

<p begin="00:06:00.970" end="00:06:06.610" style="s2">of over tourism we have thirteen point</p>

<p begin="00:06:39.790" end="00:06:45.280" style="s2">supplying industries it&#39;s really 85</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.370" end="00:06:48.790" style="s2">percent of the economy is addicted to</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.280" end="00:06:52.630" style="s2">tourism and of course over tourism has</p>

<p begin="00:06:52.630" end="00:06:58.630" style="s2">seeing income from tourism grow but</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.950" end="00:07:00.940" style="s2">inequality has grown as well and people</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.630" end="00:07:03.430" style="s2">haven&#39;t actually been sharing in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.940" end="00:07:05.560" style="s2">riches that this tourism in enterprise</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.430" end="00:07:09.640" style="s2">has generated so there&#39;s a big backlash</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.560" end="00:07:13.690" style="s2">and maybe regions like Flanders where I</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.640" end="00:07:15.670" style="s2">think tourism is about 5% of the GDP GDP</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.690" end="00:07:18.130" style="s2">being and completely an adequate measure</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.670" end="00:07:22.870" style="s2">of success anyway but I won&#39;t go into</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.130" end="00:07:25.330" style="s2">that it&#39;s slightly different I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.870" end="00:07:28.680" style="s2">talk from my experience about a place</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.330" end="00:07:32.140" style="s2">where over tourism is already happening</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.680" end="00:07:35.050" style="s2">but as I&#39;m gonna sit my profession</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.140" end="00:07:37.960" style="s2">is really directly related to tourism as</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.050" end="00:07:40.480" style="s2">a scientist I&#39;ve worked for a number of</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.960" end="00:07:44.920" style="s2">years looking at existential threats to</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.480" end="00:07:47.200" style="s2">humanity and on Ryoka it happens happen</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.920" end="00:07:50.350" style="s2">so that we have the International pre</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.200" end="00:07:52.510" style="s2">warning stations to monitor the night</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.350" end="00:07:55.030" style="s2">skies and avoid collisions with</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.510" end="00:07:56.890" style="s2">asteroids if we could ever avoid them to</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.030" end="00:07:59.350" style="s2">pre warn us that we might have an</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.890" end="00:08:01.900" style="s2">asteroid coming in because that is one</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.350" end="00:08:04.570" style="s2">of the existential threats to humanity</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.900" end="00:08:05.200" style="s2">and there&#39;s relatively little we can do</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.570" end="00:08:08.800" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.200" end="00:08:11.380" style="s2">but the one that I want to talk in more</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.800" end="00:08:13.720" style="s2">detail about is climate change and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.380" end="00:08:15.340" style="s2">collapse of ecosystems because it is</p>

<p begin="00:09:49.540" end="00:09:56.369" style="s2">this slide which was already shocking in</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.910" end="00:10:00.309" style="s2">2009 but now that 2030 is a lot closer</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.369" end="00:10:03.309" style="s2">where we see that the increasing demand</p>

<p begin="00:10:09.490" end="00:10:14.139" style="s2">by climate change and they all affect</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.889" end="00:10:15.939" style="s2">climate change and so this creates a</p>

<p begin="00:11:28.660" end="00:11:35.379" style="s2">underneath and this image is just</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.170" end="00:11:37.899" style="s2">talking about the fact that for many</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.379" end="00:11:39.970" style="s2">millions of years and particularly the</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.899" end="00:11:42.730" style="s2">last 250 years since we&#39;ve been spewing</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.970" end="00:11:44.829" style="s2">out lots of greenhouse gases the oceans</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.730" end="00:11:47.049" style="s2">have been the giant buffer they have</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.829" end="00:11:49.240" style="s2">absorbed this year too but this has</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.049" end="00:11:52.119" style="s2">caused an process of ocean acidification</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.240" end="00:11:55.839" style="s2">and once that gets to a certain point</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.119" end="00:11:57.230" style="s2">then instead of absorbing co2 the oceans</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.839" end="00:12:00.290" style="s2">start releasing co2</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.230" end="00:12:02.720" style="s2">and combining all these trigger points</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.290" end="00:12:04.910" style="s2">together means that we&#39;re very close to</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.720" end="00:12:07.580" style="s2">a point where we will not be able to</p>

<p begin="00:12:36.130" end="00:12:41.630" style="s2">again this has been a process that has</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.530" end="00:12:45.170" style="s2">gone on for a long time humanity went</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.630" end="00:12:49.460" style="s2">into planetary overshoot in the 1970s in</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.170" end="00:12:52.700" style="s2">early 1970 when I was born and since</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.460" end="00:12:55.180" style="s2">then because we&#39;ve kept destroying the</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.700" end="00:12:59.480" style="s2">ecosystems and degrading the environment</p>

<p begin="00:13:03.500" end="00:13:15.050" style="s2">going down ever since and so every year</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.300" end="00:13:17.990" style="s2">we as a species by July 29th 2019 we</p>

<p begin="00:13:24.890" end="00:13:31.220" style="s2">last all the year so from july 2019</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.970" end="00:13:33.880" style="s2">speaking into the capital rather than</p>

<p begin="00:13:33.880" end="00:13:39.560" style="s2">already got to that point in April on</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.320" end="00:13:42.260" style="s2">April 6 and Spain where I live on May 28</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.560" end="00:13:43.820" style="s2">and you can see that so many of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.260" end="00:13:46.790" style="s2">industrialized nations but also the</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.820" end="00:13:50.030" style="s2">industrialized Xing nations are already</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.790" end="00:13:52.180" style="s2">in overshoot and obviously this can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.030" end="00:13:55.340" style="s2">continue</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.180" end="00:13:57.500" style="s2">the Stockholm resilience center has</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.340" end="00:14:00.500" style="s2">created this framework of planetary</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.500" end="00:14:03.230" style="s2">boundaries 9 boundaries that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.500" end="00:14:05.780" style="s2">stay within in order to create a safe</p>

<p begin="00:14:05.780" end="00:14:09.980" style="s2">and we&#39;ve already surpassed four of them</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.360" end="00:14:10.990" style="s2">and two of them we haven&#39;t even looked</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.980" end="00:14:12.370" style="s2">at in detail yet</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.990" end="00:14:15.820" style="s2">we don&#39;t know whether we should surpass</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.370" end="00:14:19.270" style="s2">them and then in 2012 Kate ray worth</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.820" end="00:14:22.209" style="s2">while she was working for Oxfam for the</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.270" end="00:14:25.660" style="s2">UN summit in Rio the Rio +20 summit</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.209" end="00:14:27.700" style="s2">created this idea that it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.660" end="00:14:29.890" style="s2">about planetary boundaries in order to</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.700" end="00:14:32.140" style="s2">stay within planetary boundaries we need</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.890" end="00:14:35.230" style="s2">to create the socio-economic foundations</p>

<p begin="00:14:35.230" end="00:14:40.570" style="s2">so she came up with this idea of donut</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.570" end="00:14:43.450" style="s2">economics the donut really just meaning</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.570" end="00:14:45.850" style="s2">that you have the ecological ceiling and</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.450" end="00:14:49.149" style="s2">the social foundations and this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.850" end="00:14:51.029" style="s2">ring is the sweet spot and to give it a</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.149" end="00:14:57.399" style="s2">name she called it a donut</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.029" end="00:15:01.120" style="s2">so tourism is one of the industries that</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.399" end="00:15:03.630" style="s2">has caused this impact humanity&#39;s impact</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.120" end="00:15:09.250" style="s2">on the globe it follows the classic</p>

<p begin="00:15:18.040" end="00:15:24.310" style="s2">mentioned has this initial exponential</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.790" end="00:15:26.920" style="s2">growth and then it starts to level out</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.310" end="00:15:30.880" style="s2">you stop growing at some point in terms</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.920" end="00:15:34.810" style="s2">of size and started to grow in quality</p>

<p begin="00:15:36.430" end="00:15:43.029" style="s2">to learn how to make that curve and if</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.329" end="00:15:49.540" style="s2">we don&#39;t then life we&#39;ll find ways to</p>

<p begin="00:15:57.790" end="00:16:03.610" style="s2">could say we have conventional practice</p>

<p begin="00:19:45.970" end="00:19:51.280" style="s2">effective or more efficient but how do</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.980" end="00:19:54.640" style="s2">we transform tourism in a way that it</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.280" end="00:19:57.490" style="s2">actually becomes an agents or agent and</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.640" end="00:20:04.390" style="s2">catalyst of positive change in place and</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.490" end="00:20:07.450" style="s2">in region and there are three types of</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.390" end="00:20:09.690" style="s2">changes that you could say happen on</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.450" end="00:20:12.910" style="s2">four different levels of scale</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.690" end="00:20:14.620" style="s2">individual working group the affected</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.910" end="00:20:18.250" style="s2">community and the wider culture we</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.620" end="00:20:22.210" style="s2">operate in and the kind of change we now</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.250" end="00:20:25.150" style="s2">need is transformative change which is</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.210" end="00:20:28.270" style="s2">really a completely it&#39;s it&#39;s the change</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.150" end="00:20:33.670" style="s2">from the caterpillar to the butterfly it</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.270" end="00:20:35.790" style="s2">and in so much of our innovation these</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.670" end="00:20:39.340" style="s2">days when we talk about transformation</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.790" end="00:20:40.900" style="s2">and is unfortunately as colleague of</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.340" end="00:20:43.360" style="s2">mine Laura Bateson has wonderfully</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.900" end="00:20:47.290" style="s2">putted about creating caterpillars with</p>

<p begin="00:20:47.290" end="00:20:53.330" style="s2">the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.600" end="00:20:54.950" style="s2">adaptive change that just uses the</p>

<p begin="00:20:58.990" end="00:21:04.820" style="s2">fundamentally transforming the business</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.220" end="00:21:07.340" style="s2">from within and also the kind of just</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.820" end="00:21:09.260" style="s2">adjustment which is what managers tend</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.340" end="00:21:11.990" style="s2">to do is just we would change a few</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.260" end="00:21:15.800" style="s2">building blocks and move them around but</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.990" end="00:21:18.410" style="s2">both of these adaption and adjustment</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.800" end="00:21:20.450" style="s2">might be needed in the transition but we</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.410" end="00:21:23.330" style="s2">have to be very careful to keep the</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.450" end="00:21:26.179" style="s2">larger horizon of actually saying can</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.330" end="00:21:29.840" style="s2">tourism become a way that we build</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.179" end="00:21:33.230" style="s2">climate resilience in our place and in</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.840" end="00:21:35.450" style="s2">our region that we prepare for a very</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.230" end="00:21:36.890" style="s2">difficult three decades that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.450" end="00:21:38.630" style="s2">know whether we&#39;re going to make it</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.890" end="00:21:40.970" style="s2">through that eye of the needle but</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.630" end="00:21:44.840" style="s2">tourism could have a role in preparing</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.970" end="00:21:47.000" style="s2">us for it and tourism could also have it</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.840" end="00:21:49.550" style="s2">to some extent one of the negative</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.000" end="00:21:51.920" style="s2">impacts globally tourism has been the</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.550" end="00:21:54.800" style="s2">thin end of the wedge of neoliberal</p>

<p begin="00:21:54.800" end="00:22:02.240" style="s2">communities that were illiterate and</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.179" end="00:22:05.960" style="s2">didn&#39;t have electricity and build fancy</p>

<p begin="00:22:05.960" end="00:22:12.500" style="s2">opportunity would be to basically redeem</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.740" end="00:22:15.020" style="s2">maybe being in a church and we can use</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.500" end="00:22:17.240" style="s2">that kind of language we tourism has an</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.020" end="00:22:20.690" style="s2">opportunity to redeem itself for his</p>

<p begin="00:27:34.640" end="00:27:43.190" style="s2">forgotten and so we created a map and a</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.460" end="00:27:46.010" style="s2">story behind them and invited people to</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.190" end="00:27:48.170" style="s2">become to make that shift that one of my</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.010" end="00:27:50.090" style="s2">mentors so beautifully put it what we as</p>

<p begin="00:28:00.800" end="00:28:05.810" style="s2">respect comes with the wanting to learn</p>

<p begin="00:28:54.080" end="00:29:00.320" style="s2">beds on Majorca and in the process we</p>

<p begin="00:30:46.370" end="00:30:51.680" style="s2">you look at the science</p>

<p begin="00:30:57.470" end="00:31:04.640" style="s2">and tourism because it has this amazing</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.720" end="00:31:07.070" style="s2">fractal dimension just like place has a</p>

<p begin="00:31:09.920" end="00:31:16.190" style="s2">and it touches all the sectors so the</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.950" end="00:31:18.800" style="s2">opportunity when we shift into asking</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.190" end="00:31:24.950" style="s2">what can tourism give back to the world</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.800" end="00:31:27.170" style="s2">is vast and when anna pollock shared</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.950" end="00:31:29.840" style="s2">with me a paper that you wrote in 1995</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.170" end="00:31:31.970" style="s2">where she identified that tourism can be</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.840" end="00:31:34.640" style="s2">a healing business and a business of</p>

<p begin="00:32:09.279" end="00:32:13.570" style="s2">organization has been around for a long</p>

<p begin="00:32:15.820" end="00:32:19.779" style="s2">completely different way much more</p>

<p begin="00:32:19.779" end="00:32:26.890" style="s2">tourist the whole idea of regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.860" end="00:32:29.320" style="s2">tourism has already taken off in Central</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.890" end="00:32:31.450" style="s2">and South America it&#39;s just something</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.320" end="00:32:34.299" style="s2">very new still in the conversation in</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.450" end="00:32:36.460" style="s2">Europe and this little initiative is</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.299" end="00:32:37.929" style="s2">looking at how will we travel in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.460" end="00:32:40.720" style="s2">future where we go back to marine</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.929" end="00:32:43.690" style="s2">transport where we will use solar and</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.720" end="00:32:48.070" style="s2">wind power again to move us from A to B</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.690" end="00:32:50.260" style="s2">and we we just the absolute take-home</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.070" end="00:32:52.960" style="s2">message for what I would like to share</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.260" end="00:32:55.360" style="s2">with you is to stop thinking about what</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.960" end="00:32:58.570" style="s2">what we have to do to change tourism a</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.360" end="00:33:02.260" style="s2">little bit and start thinking about what</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.570" end="00:33:05.200" style="s2">can I do as a tourism professional to</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.260" end="00:33:07.510" style="s2">make tourism the agents of</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.200" end="00:33:10.000" style="s2">transformation the the catalyst of</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.510" end="00:33:11.409" style="s2">transformation so my children and my</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.000" end="00:33:14.980" style="s2">children&#39;s children can have a future</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.409" end="00:33:18.880" style="s2">and I think it&#39;s perfectly placed to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.980" end="00:33:20.890" style="s2">that agent it&#39;s turning a problem into a</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.880" end="00:33:23.409" style="s2">solution and that&#39;s what we have to do</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.890" end="00:33:26.080" style="s2">as humanity if we want to have a chance</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.409" end="00:33:28.289" style="s2">for a better tomorrow so thank you very</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.080" end="00:33:28.289" style="s2">much</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.500" end="00:33:39.570" style="s2">I I see I see I have another minute and</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.470" end="00:33:43.380" style="s2">20 seconds and I actually did have</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.570" end="00:33:45.150" style="s2">another slide very briefly this is an</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.380" end="00:33:48.270" style="s2">initiative that I&#39;m working on to give</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.150" end="00:33:51.090" style="s2">you a forward-looking opportunity it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.270" end="00:33:54.240" style="s2">it&#39;s we&#39;re currently putting together a</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.090" end="00:33:55.860" style="s2">wonderful team of people and caterers</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.240" end="00:33:59.940" style="s2">and Janine Benyus have already started</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.860" end="00:34:02.550" style="s2">work on with the local with cities all</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.940" end="00:34:05.070" style="s2">around the world within the c40 s</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.550" end="00:34:08.840" style="s2">network to create a methodology to</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.070" end="00:34:11.429" style="s2">engage people in place at the city level</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.840" end="00:34:15.090" style="s2">to explore what thriving would look like</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.429" end="00:34:17.400" style="s2">and the power of questions of how what</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.090" end="00:34:20.070" style="s2">does it mean for people to thrive in</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.400" end="00:34:22.590" style="s2">this place what does it mean for this</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.070" end="00:34:24.600" style="s2">place to thrive how do we respect the</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.590" end="00:34:26.429" style="s2">rights of all people and how do we</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.600" end="00:34:29.429" style="s2">respect the health of the whole planet</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.429" end="00:34:32.910" style="s2">these are the four questions that guide</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.429" end="00:34:35.850" style="s2">the process that will help people do</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.910" end="00:34:37.500" style="s2">this regional transformation and my hope</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.850" end="00:34:39.840" style="s2">is that we&#39;re piloting</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.500" end="00:34:42.540" style="s2">the evolution of this methodology on</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.840" end="00:34:44.160" style="s2">majorca which will mean that tourism</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.540" end="00:34:46.080" style="s2">will be central to the conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.160" end="00:34:50.040" style="s2">there will be a lot of learning from it</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.080" end="00:34:52.320" style="s2">so stay tuned this is hopefully going to</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.040" end="00:34:54.679" style="s2">happen I don&#39;t know yet thank you very</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.320" end="00:34:54.679" style="s2">much again</p>

<p begin="00:35:07.340" end="00:35:15.080" style="s2">can ask some questions now so feel free</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.300" end="00:35:17.870" style="s2">to ask please raise your hand and a</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.080" end="00:35:21.680" style="s2">microphone will be in front of you in</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.870" end="00:35:25.790" style="s2">just a few seconds there&#39;s already a</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.680" end="00:35:28.160" style="s2">lady over there and there&#39;s somebody</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.790" end="00:35:36.770" style="s2">over here can you put up your hand again</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.160" end="00:35:38.270" style="s2">yeah coming with a microphone good good</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.770" end="00:35:41.750" style="s2">morning thank you very much for your</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.270" end="00:35:44.810" style="s2">inspiring conversation here</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.750" end="00:35:46.580" style="s2">I&#39;m very interesting we working actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.810" end="00:35:49.910" style="s2">region the Netherlands where there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.580" end="00:35:52.970" style="s2">market to open there&#39;s a lot of focus on</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.910" end="00:35:54.920" style="s2">Amsterdam but the original held along</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.970" end="00:35:57.970" style="s2">for example is now looking for a</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.920" end="00:36:00.650" style="s2">direction and we noticed that the first</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.970" end="00:36:02.920" style="s2">started actually again to introduce it</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.650" end="00:36:05.950" style="s2">to in a traditional tourism approach</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.920" end="00:36:10.250" style="s2">focused on growth so how would you</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.950" end="00:36:12.170" style="s2">seduce all these policy people there to</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.250" end="00:36:14.870" style="s2">say but it&#39;s not busy yet in our region</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.170" end="00:36:18.650" style="s2">why should we start in with a different</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.870" end="00:36:20.980" style="s2">direction now mm-hmm it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.650" end="00:36:24.170" style="s2">interesting question because basically I</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.980" end="00:36:28.420" style="s2">don&#39;t know sometimes it helps to create</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.170" end="00:36:30.770" style="s2">analogies so for example the Chinese</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.420" end="00:36:33.530" style="s2">realize that there was no way that they</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.770" end="00:36:36.350" style="s2">could potentially build up a chi</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.530" end="00:36:39.860" style="s2">industry that would make cars as good as</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.350" end="00:36:42.530" style="s2">German or French cars quick enough so</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.860" end="00:36:44.630" style="s2">what they decided is let&#39;s leapfrog</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.530" end="00:36:48.260" style="s2">internal combustion engines completely</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.630" end="00:36:50.560" style="s2">and become experiment make mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.260" end="00:36:55.270" style="s2">start with the electric car now and</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.560" end="00:36:58.940" style="s2">there are 50,000 electric taxis in</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.270" end="00:37:01.100" style="s2">Shenzhen alone so giving them that kind</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.940" end="00:37:03.470" style="s2">of idea of saying if we&#39;re slow in</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.100" end="00:37:06.080" style="s2">developing as a tourist destination what</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.470" end="00:37:09.050" style="s2">we shouldn&#39;t do is to try to run behind</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.080" end="00:37:11.050" style="s2">the others and do what they&#39;ve done we</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.050" end="00:37:13.150" style="s2">have a huge opportunity to rien</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.050" end="00:37:15.670" style="s2">and what tourism could look like in this</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.150" end="00:37:18.940" style="s2">place and become a model for a new way</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.670" end="00:37:26.830" style="s2">of working and but it&#39;s just yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.940" end="00:37:29.140" style="s2">uphill battle anybody else I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.830" end="00:37:31.480" style="s2">always really happy for critical</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.140" end="00:37:33.850" style="s2">reflections so don&#39;t feel like for</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.480" end="00:37:39.190" style="s2">anything I said really didn&#39;t sit with</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.850" end="00:37:47.740" style="s2">you at all please tell me okay the</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.190" end="00:37:48.760" style="s2">microphone is coming presentation thank</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.740" end="00:37:51.400" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.760" end="00:37:53.530" style="s2">I think I&#39;m interested in in link to the</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.400" end="00:37:56.260" style="s2">previous question actually at the policy</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.530" end="00:37:58.240" style="s2">level of dynamic consultants you go to</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.260" end="00:38:00.370" style="s2">work in a new destination and they look</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.240" end="00:38:02.770" style="s2">at the World Economic Forum indicators</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.370" end="00:38:05.200" style="s2">of what makes a destination good and</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.770" end="00:38:07.810" style="s2">then they try to meet those indicators</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.200" end="00:38:09.640" style="s2">how do you go about changing those sorts</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.810" end="00:38:12.340" style="s2">of frameworks that drive national</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.640" end="00:38:14.410" style="s2">governments they drive aid agencies to</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.340" end="00:38:15.970" style="s2">reflect regenerative tourism where do</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.410" end="00:38:18.940" style="s2">you start to actually put those</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.970" end="00:38:24.460" style="s2">frameworks into a regenerative context</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.940" end="00:38:28.300" style="s2">what what I would do is what we&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.460" end="00:38:31.050" style="s2">is humanity to give us a lot of detailed</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.300" end="00:38:33.850" style="s2">knowledge about a lot of things is</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.050" end="00:38:36.400" style="s2">separate all the disciplines and become</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.850" end="00:38:41.940" style="s2">expert in narrower and narrower fields</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.400" end="00:38:44.680" style="s2">and in a way that education system has</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.940" end="00:38:47.050" style="s2">predisposed us to a blind-spot of not</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.680" end="00:38:49.750" style="s2">understanding the whole system and how</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.050" end="00:38:53.230" style="s2">it interacts and that&#39;s what has</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.750" end="00:38:55.120" style="s2">separated us from nature and that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.230" end="00:38:56.710" style="s2">meant that we used mechanistic metaphors</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.120" end="00:38:58.540" style="s2">instead of living systems metaphors and</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.710" end="00:39:00.370" style="s2">so on so to come to your question what I</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.540" end="00:39:02.590" style="s2">would do is I would look at other</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.370" end="00:39:04.810" style="s2">frameworks that policymakers have</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.590" end="00:39:08.800" style="s2">committed to an hour publicly committing</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.810" end="00:39:11.080" style="s2">to so the SDGs you can have a nuanced</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.800" end="00:39:13.600" style="s2">opinion about how good they are and</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.080" end="00:39:15.940" style="s2">whether the targets underneath are the</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.600" end="00:39:18.280" style="s2">right targets and so on but they&#39;re 17</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.940" end="00:39:20.650" style="s2">goals of which I would only question one</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.280" end="00:39:23.020" style="s2">which is goal number eight continued</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.650" end="00:39:24.430" style="s2">economic growth and good work like if if</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.020" end="00:39:26.350" style="s2">they just put in the world</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.430" end="00:39:28.660" style="s2">qualitative growth and good work I&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.350" end="00:39:30.490" style="s2">happy with it but if they keep it like</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.660" end="00:39:32.890" style="s2">it is it is the spanner in the works</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.490" end="00:39:35.110" style="s2">that will make all the other sixteen not</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.890" end="00:39:39.580" style="s2">implementable because our current</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.110" end="00:39:41.230" style="s2">economic growth addiction is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.580" end="00:39:44.200" style="s2">driving the destruction of the planet</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.230" end="00:39:46.750" style="s2">but starting with the SDGs</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.200" end="00:39:49.810" style="s2">and speaking to policy regulators and</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.750" end="00:39:52.540" style="s2">saying well how do how does your</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.810" end="00:39:56.170" style="s2">commitment to implementing the SDGs</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.540" end="00:39:58.600" style="s2">at a global forum square with your</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.170" end="00:40:01.900" style="s2">policy regulations of tourism where</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.600" end="00:40:04.600" style="s2">could you make policies that would</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.900" end="00:40:07.360" style="s2">enable tourists the tourist industry to</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.600" end="00:40:08.260" style="s2">actually implement the SDGs at the local</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.360" end="00:40:11.740" style="s2">and regional scale</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.260" end="00:40:14.650" style="s2">and if you if you look into the detail</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.740" end="00:40:17.170" style="s2">energy production water headed food</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.650" end="00:40:20.860" style="s2">procurement local procurement of food</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.170" end="00:40:23.680" style="s2">and and connect all the other policies</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.860" end="00:40:26.140" style="s2">that they&#39;re talking about true tourism</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.680" end="00:40:31.020" style="s2">then I think you have a beginning of a</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.140" end="00:40:31.020" style="s2">leverage point does that make sense</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.760" end="00:40:48.020" style="s2">there&#39;s one in red question of the way</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.160" end="00:40:51.620" style="s2">down red yeah thank you very much for</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.020" end="00:40:53.660" style="s2">your inspiring presentation and my</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.620" end="00:40:56.720" style="s2">question was a little bit related to</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.660" end="00:40:59.810" style="s2">what mr. Holland Rhys also said that one</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.720" end="00:41:04.160" style="s2">of the cornerstones to have this</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.810" end="00:41:10.040" style="s2">qualitative growth may be no growth may</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.160" end="00:41:11.840" style="s2">be is the attitude of the tourists now</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.040" end="00:41:14.570" style="s2">we are a little bit in a contradiction</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.840" end="00:41:16.820" style="s2">there that we see that a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.570" end="00:41:20.360" style="s2">want to be sustainable and act</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.820" end="00:41:24.650" style="s2">sustainable unless they are on holidays</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.360" end="00:41:25.790" style="s2">and it has to do with tourism so where</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.650" end="00:41:28.370" style="s2">do you start</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.790" end="00:41:31.610" style="s2">what is your suggestion on that issue</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.370" end="00:41:33.680" style="s2">well I I&#39;m not too sure because I just I</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.610" end="00:41:35.960" style="s2">took the slide out in order to make the</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.680" end="00:41:39.290" style="s2">presentation shorter but some of you</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.960" end="00:41:41.360" style="s2">might know that Prince Harry was</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.290" end="00:41:45.680" style="s2">involved in launching this Travel list</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.360" end="00:41:48.950" style="s2">initiative just last week I think and</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.680" end="00:41:50.980" style="s2">when I followed the media on that I saw</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.950" end="00:41:57.410" style="s2">a bunch of statistics that they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.980" end="00:41:59.810" style="s2">offered in terms of large questionnaires</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.410" end="00:42:02.420" style="s2">that went around and asked tourists and</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.810" end="00:42:05.240" style="s2">all the indication was that somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.420" end="00:42:08.240" style="s2">between 60 and 70 percent of tourists</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.240" end="00:42:11.750" style="s2">given the choice would prefer to travel</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.240" end="00:42:13.960" style="s2">in a way that does impact the</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.750" end="00:42:17.030" style="s2">environment less and they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.960" end="00:42:20.540" style="s2">interested in tourism the money that</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.030" end="00:42:23.060" style="s2">they leave in a destination benefiting</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.540" end="00:42:25.070" style="s2">the destination and that these large</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.060" end="00:42:27.140" style="s2">tourism empires don&#39;t become the</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.070" end="00:42:28.850" style="s2">middlemen and siphon off the wealth of</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.140" end="00:42:32.270" style="s2">tourism in a way that it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.850" end="00:42:35.810" style="s2">actually hit the local community so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.270" end="00:42:38.000" style="s2">not sure of course that it is a paradox</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.810" end="00:42:42.710" style="s2">that we all I mean I came came here by</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.000" end="00:42:45.830" style="s2">airplane and tourism as a whole travel</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.710" end="00:42:47.390" style="s2">and tourism contributes about 5% of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.830" end="00:42:50.530" style="s2">greenhouse gas image</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.390" end="00:42:53.030" style="s2">would that humanity is emitting to</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.530" end="00:42:56.540" style="s2">exasperate the climate change problem</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.030" end="00:43:00.620" style="s2">so we definitely need to change the way</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.540" end="00:43:02.720" style="s2">we travel but I think the willingness of</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.620" end="00:43:05.560" style="s2">the consumer is actually starting to</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.720" end="00:43:08.510" style="s2">change quite drastically and and</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.560" end="00:43:12.710" style="s2">initiatives like this riders for future</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.510" end="00:43:15.800" style="s2">school strike is going to make the</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.710" end="00:43:18.080" style="s2">parents of these children more even more</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.800" end="00:43:21.020" style="s2">aware that there now is a really urgent</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.080" end="00:43:25.160" style="s2">issue around avoiding cataclysmic</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.020" end="00:43:27.170" style="s2">runaway climate change and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.160" end="00:43:30.380" style="s2">it&#39;s really important to prepare for the</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.170" end="00:43:33.710" style="s2">changes that we will have demanded from</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.380" end="00:43:36.980" style="s2">us as an industry from the consumer now</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.710" end="00:43:39.500" style="s2">it&#39;s true it&#39;s too late to wait even</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.980" end="00:43:42.710" style="s2">five years time government policies</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.500" end="00:43:45.800" style="s2">starting to regulate the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.710" end="00:43:50.360" style="s2">kerosene is still not taxed the minute</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.800" end="00:43:53.140" style="s2">we internalize the externalities the</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.360" end="00:43:57.080" style="s2">costs socially in ecological costs of</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.140" end="00:43:59.360" style="s2">tourism and travel the the economics of</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.080" end="00:44:02.960" style="s2">tourism will change drastically and I</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.360" end="00:44:06.680" style="s2">think that&#39;s where we need to what we</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.960" end="00:44:08.720" style="s2">need to prepare for now and so certainly</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.680" end="00:44:12.410" style="s2">on a destination like Majorca where I</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.720" end="00:44:15.560" style="s2">live it&#39;s impossible that we&#39;ll have 18</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.410" end="00:44:18.740" style="s2">million tourists arrive in ten years</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.560" end="00:44:21.110" style="s2">time we I don&#39;t think we will and so we</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.740" end="00:44:23.780" style="s2">need to even in that industry shift</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.110" end="00:44:26.120" style="s2">towards a qualitative offer that has</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.780" end="00:44:27.860" style="s2">less tourists that might stay for longer</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.120" end="00:44:29.650" style="s2">that engage in a different way</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.860" end="00:44:34.250" style="s2">tourism has the opportunity to become</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.650" end="00:44:37.280" style="s2">part of reinventing education imagine</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.250" end="00:44:40.760" style="s2">that that&#39;s a transformative idea where</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.280" end="00:44:43.160" style="s2">tourism isn&#39;t just about consuming a</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.760" end="00:44:45.620" style="s2">nice experience but sharing your</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.160" end="00:44:48.080" style="s2">expertise in Europe and taking learning</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.620" end="00:44:52.510" style="s2">in one place back to your home home</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.080" end="00:44:54.860" style="s2">place tourism has a role in reinventing</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.510" end="00:44:58.040" style="s2">geriatric care and how we deal with</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.860" end="00:44:59.220" style="s2">elderly like all these infrastructures</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.040" end="00:45:02.250" style="s2">that might</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.220" end="00:45:04.710" style="s2">soon not be needed in those numbers</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.250" end="00:45:10.140" style="s2">could convert themselves into being</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.710" end="00:45:11.970" style="s2">places where people who are elderly can</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.140" end="00:45:14.550" style="s2">spend three or four months in a</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.970" end="00:45:19.530" style="s2">sheltered living type environment in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.550" end="00:45:22.800" style="s2">European South while the North is too</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.530" end="00:45:46.980" style="s2">cold and so we really need to think out</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.800" end="00:45:50.160" style="s2">of the box I think to do that we all</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.980" end="00:45:51.900" style="s2">would reach a destination management</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.160" end="00:45:56.369" style="s2">scheme which allows us to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.900" end="00:45:59.460" style="s2">regenerative in the existing tourism</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.369" end="00:46:02.190" style="s2">destinations however tourism demand is</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.460" end="00:46:04.710" style="s2">growing faster it&#39;s still faster and</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.190" end="00:46:08.220" style="s2">we&#39;re still faster what are we going to</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.710" end="00:46:11.579" style="s2">do about that we&#39;ll new destinations</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.220" end="00:46:14.160" style="s2">emerge they will probably do the same</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.579" end="00:46:16.470" style="s2">and transfer be transformative but</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.160" end="00:46:19.680" style="s2">nevertheless they will have you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.470" end="00:46:24.390" style="s2">people moving around with no technology</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.680" end="00:46:27.900" style="s2">to adapt what is the core problem then</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.390" end="00:46:30.480" style="s2">it&#39;s the tourism demand we are looking</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.900" end="00:46:32.849" style="s2">for a solution in the place which is of</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.480" end="00:46:37.859" style="s2">course very necessary but it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.849" end="00:46:40.079" style="s2">catch the basic problem and the basic</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.859" end="00:46:42.569" style="s2">problem could be a too many people</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.079" end="00:46:45.990" style="s2">trying to move too much around this</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.569" end="00:46:48.599" style="s2">globe and be not being able to do it in</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.990" end="00:46:53.760" style="s2">a sustainable way we never raised that</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.599" end="00:46:57.240" style="s2">question should we as a sector push</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.760" end="00:46:59.160" style="s2">further and you know lobby towards new</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.240" end="00:47:01.980" style="s2">technology could it be soft with</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.160" end="00:47:04.410" style="s2">technology would we really need to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.980" end="00:47:07.020" style="s2">more tourists more and more times a year</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.410" end="00:47:10.770" style="s2">or do we have to say I might do better</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.020" end="00:47:12.020" style="s2">without being no tourists this year how</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.770" end="00:47:15.620" style="s2">would we manage that</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.020" end="00:47:19.550" style="s2">destination market is how do we dare to</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.620" end="00:47:23.300" style="s2">ask that question just an open idea yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.550" end="00:47:28.880" style="s2">that&#39;s a very important questions and I</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.300" end="00:47:30.860" style="s2">guess there&#39;s there&#39;s a the way we</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.880" end="00:47:32.870" style="s2">measure success and the way we talk</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.860" end="00:47:34.430" style="s2">about the future is always a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.870" end="00:47:36.530" style="s2">of a double-edged sword</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.430" end="00:47:39.710" style="s2">I mentioned that GDP is a very</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.530" end="00:47:41.450" style="s2">inadequate measure of success and a lot</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.710" end="00:47:43.520" style="s2">of conversations that we need to change</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.450" end="00:47:46.820" style="s2">our economic measure of success to</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.520" end="00:47:49.370" style="s2">include all the externalities because at</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.820" end="00:47:52.190" style="s2">current rates natural disasters are</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.370" end="00:47:54.470" style="s2">positive for GDP growth and so on and</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.190" end="00:47:57.110" style="s2">similarly I think all those predictions</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.470" end="00:48:00.620" style="s2">of tourism demand its rapid at the</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.110" end="00:48:02.900" style="s2">moment but um because tourism doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.620" end="00:48:05.480" style="s2">live in that bubble it is part of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.900" end="00:48:07.400" style="s2">global system which increasingly is</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.480" end="00:48:09.680" style="s2">coming closer together because of all</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.400" end="00:48:14.300" style="s2">the the walls were running into now and</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.680" end="00:48:17.330" style="s2">I think that those those predictions</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.300" end="00:48:21.560" style="s2">might not pan out the way that we now</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.330" end="00:48:26.240" style="s2">believe and so preparing as I just said</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.560" end="00:48:28.730" style="s2">for a contraction in numbers from</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.240" end="00:48:32.600" style="s2">international tourists but maybe an</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.730" end="00:48:37.100" style="s2">expansion of numbers from more regional</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.600" end="00:48:39.890" style="s2">to tourists is wise and looking at</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.100" end="00:48:42.500" style="s2">enabling different ways of travelling</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.890" end="00:48:44.960" style="s2">that have less environmental impact is</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.500" end="00:48:47.720" style="s2">wise there&#39;s a whole range of</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.960" end="00:48:51.710" style="s2">initiatives on nautical engineering and</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.720" end="00:48:53.780" style="s2">and new types of sailboats but again it</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.710" end="00:48:55.550" style="s2">would also mean that this whole culture</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.780" end="00:48:59.330" style="s2">shifting the culture from the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.550" end="00:49:02.480" style="s2">two or three-day holiday break fly is</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.330" end="00:49:06.740" style="s2">somewhere on Ryanair to a culture that</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.480" end="00:49:09.800" style="s2">might just mean going on holiday months</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.740" end="00:49:12.830" style="s2">a year for a longer period of time in a</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.800" end="00:49:15.800" style="s2">much deeper way learning more deeply in</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.830" end="00:49:19.130" style="s2">the place maybe even work is changing as</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.800" end="00:49:21.560" style="s2">well so so people could in a more</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.130" end="00:49:24.130" style="s2">flexible way stay in the destination</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.560" end="00:49:27.280" style="s2">longer but work from the destination</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.130" end="00:49:28.780" style="s2">and and creating the tourism</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.280" end="00:49:39.520" style="s2">infrastructures that would enable that</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.780" end="00:49:42.100" style="s2">would play into that so yeah people in</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.520" end="00:49:44.740" style="s2">Europe so it might apply to us in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.100" end="00:49:46.450" style="s2">ideal world but we have Chinese running</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.740" end="00:49:49.450" style="s2">around we have Indians running around</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.450" end="00:49:51.160" style="s2">they&#39;re catching up very fast on an</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.450" end="00:49:56.320" style="s2">economic scale so they have money to</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.160" end="00:49:59.530" style="s2">spend can we say no you can&#39;t come can</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.320" end="00:50:01.780" style="s2">you as an old continent say towards the</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.530" end="00:50:04.240" style="s2">newcomers no you can&#39;t do the same error</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.780" end="00:50:07.450" style="s2">that we did maybe they want to do that</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.240" end="00:50:10.240" style="s2">and how who are we to say maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.450" end="00:50:13.270" style="s2">should find a new way to travel to the</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.240" end="00:50:15.400" style="s2">new customers because we only look to to</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.270" end="00:50:17.830" style="s2">the European and North American people</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.400" end="00:50:20.800" style="s2">but you never get into the mind of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.830" end="00:50:23.050" style="s2">other tourists of tomorrow how are we</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.800" end="00:50:26.050" style="s2">going to cope that is it ethically</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.050" end="00:50:28.030" style="s2">acceptable to change their behavior or</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.050" end="00:50:31.720" style="s2">asking them to change their future</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.030" end="00:50:34.090" style="s2">behavior I don&#39;t know this I think we</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.720" end="00:50:37.080" style="s2">should more ask such questions on the</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.090" end="00:50:40.330" style="s2">long term yeah I mean the Chinese</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.080" end="00:50:43.000" style="s2">government is promoting an initiative</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.330" end="00:50:45.730" style="s2">that is asking the question what would</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.000" end="00:50:50.020" style="s2">an ecological civilization look like and</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.730" end="00:50:52.810" style="s2">what role can China have in leading the</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.020" end="00:50:54.850" style="s2">world in creating such an ecological</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.810" end="00:50:57.520" style="s2">civilization it might just be a big</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.850" end="00:51:00.820" style="s2">marketing trick in a lot of the trends</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.520" end="00:51:05.170" style="s2">and such but the awareness is growing</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.820" end="00:51:08.550" style="s2">everywhere and again it&#39;s this sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.170" end="00:51:11.320" style="s2">it&#39;s very hard to imagine how quickly</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.550" end="00:51:16.870" style="s2">paradigms do shift when they finally</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.320" end="00:51:19.090" style="s2">shift and and so since China and India</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.870" end="00:51:22.120" style="s2">and the frontline of climate change they</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.090" end="00:51:25.020" style="s2">will feel climate change hitting them</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.120" end="00:51:29.260" style="s2">hard much sooner and it is an unfair</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.020" end="00:51:32.290" style="s2">fact of history that we the northern</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.260" end="00:51:35.200" style="s2">nations Europe in Belgium in the Congo</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.290" end="00:51:37.119" style="s2">and so on there was the first large wave</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.200" end="00:51:39.900" style="s2">of colonialization then was</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.119" end="00:51:44.259" style="s2">second wave of neoliberal economics</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.900" end="00:51:47.200" style="s2">doing a new extraction and abuse off the</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.259" end="00:51:49.450" style="s2">global south and now on top of it the</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.200" end="00:51:52.299" style="s2">nations that are responsible for most of</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.450" end="00:51:55.930" style="s2">the emissions of greenhouse gases are</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.299" end="00:51:57.549" style="s2">the ones that less affected than the</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.930" end="00:52:00.700" style="s2">ones that have already been hit twice by</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.549" end="00:52:04.299" style="s2">us and and to address that global issue</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.700" end="00:52:07.180" style="s2">and that inequality issue is is massive</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.299" end="00:52:09.700" style="s2">it goes much beyond tourism and and we</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.180" end="00:52:13.059" style="s2">need to address it but again bringing it</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.700" end="00:52:16.930" style="s2">back to that little girl with Asperger&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.059" end="00:52:18.819" style="s2">like when when it because one of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.930" end="00:52:22.420" style="s2">things that condition does is it creates</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.819" end="00:52:26.380" style="s2">a single focus and kind of blocks out</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.420" end="00:52:28.779" style="s2">the fuzz around it and the issue of</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.380" end="00:52:33.549" style="s2">having to respond to this planetary</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.779" end="00:52:35.440" style="s2">emergency is now such that we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.549" end="00:52:37.900" style="s2">an option not to respond and to say</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.440" end="00:52:42.009" style="s2">about but you cannot economists won&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.900" end="00:52:46.450" style="s2">along with it or governments won&#39;t they</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.009" end="00:52:49.569" style="s2">will they&#39;ll have to or else we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.450" end="00:52:50.529" style="s2">suffer the consequences greatly thank</p>

<p begin="00:53:03.700" end="00:53:08.470" style="s2">reconnect to what I would call the the</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.309" end="00:53:11.049" style="s2">big power socket which is spending time</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.470" end="00:53:14.619" style="s2">in nature wild nature as much as</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.049" end="00:53:19.499" style="s2">possible em pruning back to basics so I</p>

<p begin="00:53:25.150" end="00:53:30.819" style="s2">I do there is giving back to the local</p>

<p begin="00:53:36.339" end="00:53:40.329" style="s2">think that&#39;s a misconception you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:53:53.859" end="00:53:57.750" style="s2">and where my life ends and I would do</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.349" end="00:54:01.119" style="s2">the same thing with tourism I would</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.750" end="00:54:03.369" style="s2">actually go to places only if I can also</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.119" end="00:54:05.140" style="s2">set up an opportunity to contribute to</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.369" end="00:54:08.440" style="s2">the place by giving talks or workshops</p>
