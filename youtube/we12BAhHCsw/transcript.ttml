<p begin="00:02:35.420" end="00:02:42.080" style="s2">making the videos I made this equipment</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.920" end="00:02:43.490" style="s2">for a reason I don&#39;t know but that</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.080" end="00:02:45.020" style="s2">reason it&#39;s at the moment cuz I bring it</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.490" end="00:02:48.010" style="s2">it&#39;s way too exhausted to think of what</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.020" end="00:02:51.920" style="s2">that is but just to put myself out there</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.010" end="00:02:53.420" style="s2">to the universe and one of these days</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.920" end="00:02:55.610" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna be able to explain my global</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.420" end="00:02:59.120" style="s2">cooperative in a way that the right</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.610" end="00:03:00.530" style="s2">person hears it and hopefully they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.120" end="00:03:03.080" style="s2">able to explain it to more people in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.530" end="00:03:04.130" style="s2">better way than I can but maybe they can</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.080" end="00:03:05.030" style="s2">stand together and we&#39;ll figure out</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.130" end="00:03:06.709" style="s2">another way and we&#39;ll have the third</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.030" end="00:03:08.630" style="s2">person and a fourth person and as people</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.709" end="00:03:12.410" style="s2">come on board willingly and</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.630" end="00:03:17.570" style="s2">enthusiastically we will change this</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.410" end="00:03:19.430" style="s2">planet and there&#39;s nothing besides maybe</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.570" end="00:03:21.470" style="s2">being a mom but I mean this is part of</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.430" end="00:03:25.790" style="s2">me being a mom that I can do that&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.470" end="00:03:30.560" style="s2">important it not and honoring that even</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.790" end="00:03:32.540" style="s2">in a society that doesn&#39;t honor that</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.560" end="00:03:34.130" style="s2">that when you&#39;re not working for a</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.540" end="00:03:37.280" style="s2">living when you&#39;re on disability when</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.130" end="00:03:40.920" style="s2">you&#39;re doing other things you&#39;re I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.280" end="00:03:45.420" style="s2">know considered less than</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.920" end="00:03:47.280" style="s2">and I&#39;m working to change that in my own</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.420" end="00:03:50.700" style="s2">subconscious I think it has shifted</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.280" end="00:03:55.050" style="s2">greatly in the last year especially in</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.700" end="00:03:58.200" style="s2">the last six months or so realizing that</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.050" end="00:04:00.000" style="s2">my mental labor of constantly thinking a</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.200" end="00:04:02.520" style="s2">DB and not being able to turn it off is</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.000" end="00:04:04.830" style="s2">labor and although I&#39;m not able to maybe</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.520" end="00:04:07.260" style="s2">physically put in as much labor as other</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.830" end="00:04:09.390" style="s2">people a lot of the time and I&#39;m still</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.260" end="00:04:11.069" style="s2">dealing with that I&#39;m still very much</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.390" end="00:04:13.980" style="s2">believe I have my disability and my</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.069" end="00:04:15.810" style="s2">illnesses are limitations for a reason</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.980" end="00:04:16.950" style="s2">and they&#39;re either going to teach you</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.810" end="00:04:20.370" style="s2">what they&#39;re here to teach me and</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.950" end="00:04:21.480" style="s2">they&#39;ll dissolve and go away or they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.370" end="00:04:22.710" style="s2">here permanently and there&#39;s something I</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.480" end="00:04:24.870" style="s2">have to deal with and I have to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.710" end="00:04:26.880" style="s2">be okay with both of those options not</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.870" end="00:04:29.240" style="s2">give up on trying to find a solution and</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.880" end="00:04:31.650" style="s2">trying to have more energy but also not</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.240" end="00:04:34.380" style="s2">living in that future where that&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.650" end="00:04:37.800" style="s2">happen I have the energy I have I have</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.380" end="00:04:41.120" style="s2">the life I have and to just keep doing</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.800" end="00:04:46.350" style="s2">what I can on a day-to-day basis and</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.120" end="00:04:49.320" style="s2">being kind to myself that where I&#39;m at</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.350" end="00:04:51.210" style="s2">here&#39;s where I&#39;m at and this is pretty</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.320" end="00:04:54.150" style="s2">close to five minutes of me rambling so</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.210" end="00:04:56.570" style="s2">I will see you all tomorrow happy</p>
