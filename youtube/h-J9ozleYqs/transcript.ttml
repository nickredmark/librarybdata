<p begin="00:00:00.920" end="00:00:06.750" style="s2">so while I was in Australia I applied to</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.589" end="00:00:08.910" style="s2">UBC got in and got into the science one</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.750" end="00:00:11.670" style="s2">program which is pretty prestigious</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.910" end="00:00:14.790" style="s2">program I possibly got into it because I</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.670" end="00:00:16.109" style="s2">was a mature student I had taken four</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.790" end="00:00:20.130" style="s2">years off so I was twenty-one everyone</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.109" end="00:00:22.050" style="s2">else was like eighteen I don&#39;t think I</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.130" end="00:00:25.260" style="s2">would have passed my first year and</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.050" end="00:00:27.060" style="s2">continued on if I hadn&#39;t been in science</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.260" end="00:00:29.490" style="s2">one because there was a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.060" end="00:00:31.380" style="s2">camaraderie we helped each other so</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.490" end="00:00:32.669" style="s2">although I didn&#39;t understand physics</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.380" end="00:00:34.020" style="s2">there was at least people on my team</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.669" end="00:00:36.360" style="s2">that would understand it and help me</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.020" end="00:00:39.000" style="s2">through it we like did some of our tests</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.360" end="00:00:40.739" style="s2">and teams so they helped at that part we</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.000" end="00:00:43.469" style="s2">had open book tests and we weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.739" end="00:00:45.660" style="s2">expected to memorize and regurgitate</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.469" end="00:00:49.890" style="s2">information we were expected to tackle</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.660" end="00:00:52.800" style="s2">hard problems like scientists should we</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.890" end="00:00:55.110" style="s2">the calculus teaching that year was a</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.800" end="00:00:56.670" style="s2"> show because it was taught in this</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.110" end="00:00:58.739" style="s2">weird where we weren&#39;t expected to have</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.670" end="00:01:00.300" style="s2">had it not every high school teaches</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.739" end="00:01:02.010" style="s2">calculus so they couldn&#39;t expect you to</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.300" end="00:01:04.470" style="s2">have had it but because the vast</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.010" end="00:01:06.750" style="s2">majority of students in science one had</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.470" end="00:01:08.850" style="s2">learnt it they taught it in this way</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.750" end="00:01:11.700" style="s2">that was weight over heads of people who</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.850" end="00:01:13.770" style="s2">hadn&#39;t learned it like myself and way</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.700" end="00:01:17.880" style="s2">under the heads of people who had</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.770" end="00:01:21.330" style="s2">something under it was too easy for</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.880" end="00:01:23.549" style="s2">people who had already learnt it but the</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.330" end="00:01:25.950" style="s2">intertwining of having these 70 students</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.549" end="00:01:27.659" style="s2">learn biology and chemistry and physics</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.950" end="00:01:31.159" style="s2">and math together in the same room and</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.659" end="00:01:33.890" style="s2">be able expected to tackle problems was</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.159" end="00:01:36.530" style="s2">amazing then I went on to second year</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.890" end="00:01:38.549" style="s2">where everything was regurgitation</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.530" end="00:01:42.390" style="s2">everything was memorize it and</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.549" end="00:01:44.549" style="s2">regurgitated on a test and because of</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.390" end="00:01:45.780" style="s2">how science won all those people went on</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.549" end="00:01:48.149" style="s2">to physics and chemistry and biology</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.780" end="00:01:50.040" style="s2">there was always at least one or two</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.149" end="00:01:52.290" style="s2">people from science one in your in your</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.040" end="00:01:54.270" style="s2">class and so you had like a ready-made</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.290" end="00:01:55.649" style="s2">study group you also had a ready-made</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.270" end="00:01:57.119" style="s2">place to go and have a study group</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.649" end="00:01:59.460" style="s2">because you just went hunt out the old</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.119" end="00:02:03.540" style="s2">science one classroom with the new</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.460" end="00:02:05.490" style="s2">science one kids I got to experience</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.540" end="00:02:10.470" style="s2">like the politics of science and</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.490" end="00:02:11.099" style="s2">understand more of like who gets into</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.470" end="00:02:13.470" style="s2">Medical School</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.099" end="00:02:14.760" style="s2">not people I want to trust</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.470" end="00:02:16.530" style="s2">the people who know how to fake their</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.760" end="00:02:17.700" style="s2">grades and know how to like get on</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.530" end="00:02:19.350" style="s2">student council and then never</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.700" end="00:02:27.300" style="s2">participate in it just so they can put</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.350" end="00:02:28.890" style="s2">that on the resume I got in I was ended</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.300" end="00:02:30.900" style="s2">up working in a laboratory and getting</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.890" end="00:02:33.780" style="s2">paid partly because from the science one</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.900" end="00:02:35.960" style="s2">experience and that experience was</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.780" end="00:02:40.050" style="s2">amazing because we would sit in on lab</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.960" end="00:02:41.550" style="s2">meetings and we were treated like we</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.050" end="00:02:44.910" style="s2">were members of the lab even though we</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.550" end="00:02:46.530" style="s2">were undergrad students we got to</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.910" end="00:02:49.320" style="s2">troubleshoot the experiment run the</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.530" end="00:02:50.430" style="s2">experiment help design it it was the</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.320" end="00:02:54.200" style="s2">point where we were I think going to</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.430" end="00:02:56.430" style="s2">have our names on the published article</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.200" end="00:02:59.340" style="s2">but I don&#39;t think we ended up having</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.430" end="00:03:02.430" style="s2">them on there because we&#39;re undergrad</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.340" end="00:03:04.709" style="s2">students I also got diagnosed with brain</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.430" end="00:03:08.700" style="s2">tumors I was in university which will be</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.709" end="00:03:11.370" style="s2">its own its own video I ended up taking</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.700" end="00:03:14.880" style="s2">an integrated science degree which is an</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.370" end="00:03:16.500" style="s2">option when you are in university I took</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.880" end="00:03:18.150" style="s2">a minor in economics but you can&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.500" end="00:03:19.620" style="s2">a minor and an integrated science degree</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.150" end="00:03:21.720" style="s2">so I don&#39;t actually have a minor in</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.620" end="00:03:22.790" style="s2">economics by checking off courses to</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.720" end="00:03:24.810" style="s2">have what would be a minor</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.790" end="00:03:27.120" style="s2">integrated science degree meant I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.810" end="00:03:28.650" style="s2">have to follow the usual path I got to</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.120" end="00:03:31.140" style="s2">pick and choose the courses that I</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.650" end="00:03:32.970" style="s2">wanted and the sciences I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.140" end="00:03:36.050" style="s2">integrate from genetics the super-small</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.970" end="00:03:38.820" style="s2">how does our DNA dictate our lives and</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.050" end="00:03:41.610" style="s2">ecology how does the big system work and</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.820" end="00:03:43.290" style="s2">for me that was very intuitive and like</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.610" end="00:03:45.030" style="s2">of course the genetics interplays and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.290" end="00:03:47.459" style="s2">need economics to use it in the actual</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.030" end="00:03:50.720" style="s2">world and economics in a college you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.459" end="00:03:53.790" style="s2">actually very intertwined with their the</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.720" end="00:03:55.739" style="s2">Wow the formulas that are in both of</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.790" end="00:04:01.650" style="s2">them exponential growth and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.739" end="00:04:03.150" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of similarities but the</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.650" end="00:04:06.030" style="s2">fact that like they couldn&#39;t see the</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.150" end="00:04:08.430" style="s2">genetics in ecology were were natural to</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.030" end="00:04:09.570" style="s2">integrate and I could was also iOpener</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.430" end="00:04:11.190" style="s2">they&#39;re like know what we mean is</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.570" end="00:04:14.489" style="s2">chemistry and biology you need to take</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.190" end="00:04:15.989" style="s2">like to relate unrelated fields that we</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.489" end="00:04:17.600" style="s2">can see the relative to you can see how</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.989" end="00:04:21.330" style="s2">you bring chemistry into biology there</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.600" end="00:04:23.370" style="s2">if there is biological chemistry that is</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.330" end="00:04:25.050" style="s2">a field it&#39;s probably not called that</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.370" end="00:04:27.300" style="s2">exact word I can&#39;t take a peek that word</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.050" end="00:04:36.569" style="s2">but I think biochemistry</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.300" end="00:04:41.909" style="s2">it&#39;s called biochemistry all of my</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.569" end="00:04:43.050" style="s2">university experience I&#39;m so happy I had</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.909" end="00:04:47.669" style="s2">it I don&#39;t think it was worth the</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.050" end="00:04:49.110" style="s2">$40,000 I paid for it because what I</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.669" end="00:04:50.400" style="s2">learned wasn&#39;t necessarily than the</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.110" end="00:04:52.770" style="s2">textbooks it was like learning</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.400" end="00:04:54.180" style="s2">everything you don&#39;t know learning that</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.770" end="00:04:55.669" style="s2">even after you have an undergrad degree</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.180" end="00:04:58.530" style="s2">even after your passion about something</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.669" end="00:05:01.710" style="s2">you kind of have to go on to a masters</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.530" end="00:05:03.090" style="s2">and a PhD both to work in it but also to</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.710" end="00:05:06.569" style="s2">truly feel like you have something to</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.090" end="00:05:08.159" style="s2">offer you have to tackle a problem and</p>

<p begin="00:05:08.159" end="00:05:12.599" style="s2">laboratory or field and I knew the lab</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.860" end="00:05:13.919" style="s2">the lab work wasn&#39;t quite for me I</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.599" end="00:05:14.930" style="s2">couldn&#39;t see myself doing that as a</p>

<p begin="00:05:14.930" end="00:05:19.759" style="s2">coming in at seven eight like coming in</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.039" end="00:05:22.800" style="s2">all night like pipette petri dishes and</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.759" end="00:05:25.080" style="s2">you know you was spending months and</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.800" end="00:05:26.460" style="s2">months to come up with the Eureka moment</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.080" end="00:05:29.069" style="s2">and then maybe not because the</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.460" end="00:05:30.750" style="s2">experiment failed it was there wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.069" end="00:05:33.120" style="s2">quite enough payoff for me to be in that</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.750" end="00:05:34.740" style="s2">and I was in school to become like the</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.120" end="00:05:36.719" style="s2">jane goodall of elephants and I realized</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.740" end="00:05:38.669" style="s2">I don&#39;t actually want to be outside</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.719" end="00:05:41.130" style="s2">following elephants around it was like</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.669" end="00:05:42.860" style="s2">the romantic idea of what I was gonna do</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.130" end="00:05:45.360" style="s2">versus the actual idea and I think</p>
