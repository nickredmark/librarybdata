<p begin="00:02:07.290" end="00:02:12.270" style="s2">you some of the good news first we were</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.360" end="00:02:13.800" style="s2">able to recover somewhat from some of</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.270" end="00:02:15.870" style="s2">the planning area errors that</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.800" end="00:02:19.440" style="s2">were slowing our response to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.870" end="00:02:22.800" style="s2">pandemic I mean that pandemics had been</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.440" end="00:02:25.170" style="s2">planned for planned against for decades</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.800" end="00:02:27.720" style="s2">I mean stretching back in the 70s the</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.170" end="00:02:30.510" style="s2">problem is our pandemic planning assumed</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.720" end="00:02:33.090" style="s2">the world of 1980s or 90s you know much</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.510" end="00:02:37.460" style="s2">slower world no one as complex and as</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.090" end="00:02:40.740" style="s2">fast-moving is as this one so that</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.460" end="00:02:44.550" style="s2">caused three major problems one was that</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.740" end="00:02:47.400" style="s2">there was a policy of only shutting off</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.550" end="00:02:50.340" style="s2">air traffic to specific countries only</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.400" end="00:02:52.170" style="s2">after you know deliberation they shut</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.340" end="00:02:54.660" style="s2">off that air traffic rather than</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.170" end="00:02:57.120" style="s2">everything at once in a very connected</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.660" end="00:02:59.190" style="s2">world that you know shutting off air</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.120" end="00:03:01.590" style="s2">traffic to one country just just doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.190" end="00:03:03.150" style="s2">do it or you know quarantine eating all</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.590" end="00:03:05.100" style="s2">the passengers coming in just from one</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.150" end="00:03:07.230" style="s2">country just doesn&#39;t do it them you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.100" end="00:03:08.820" style="s2">that kind of blockage sure damage is</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.230" end="00:03:11.130" style="s2">easily routed around in this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.820" end="00:03:15.270" style="s2">system we&#39;re still not fully shut down</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.130" end="00:03:17.940" style="s2">on air travel side but or better than we</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.270" end="00:03:20.220" style="s2">were the second one was that the we</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.940" end="00:03:24.110" style="s2">would have time to ramp up testing and</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.220" end="00:03:27.000" style="s2">so the way the FDA handled the testing</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.110" end="00:03:30.510" style="s2">situation is that they were focusing on</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.000" end="00:03:32.310" style="s2">quality and they gave the CDC a monopoly</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.510" end="00:03:33.570" style="s2">on testing production which seemed</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.310" end="00:03:36.140" style="s2">reasonable for a slow-moving</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.570" end="00:03:40.200" style="s2">pandemic or you know relatively so and</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.140" end="00:03:41.850" style="s2">when the CDC screwed up you know single</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.200" end="00:03:44.070" style="s2">point of failure at the end of February</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.850" end="00:03:46.950" style="s2">you know the wheels came off the bus it</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.070" end="00:03:49.380" style="s2">and the FDA responded by saying okay</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.950" end="00:03:51.900" style="s2">we&#39;ll have a streamlined procedure for</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.380" end="00:03:54.120" style="s2">from you know independent labs or public</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.900" end="00:03:56.489" style="s2">health labs to apply for starting</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.120" end="00:03:57.810" style="s2">testing and everyone pushed back you</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.489" end="00:03:59.130" style="s2">know a streamlined procedure what the</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.810" end="00:04:00.630" style="s2">hell are you talking about this is this</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.130" end="00:04:03.720" style="s2">should be like all hands assholes and</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.630" end="00:04:06.660" style="s2">elbows you let&#39;s go and they ended up</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.720" end="00:04:08.670" style="s2">saying okay well anyone who&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.660" end="00:04:12.090" style="s2">authorized for complex testing get going</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.670" end="00:04:14.730" style="s2">and so they zoomed up the testing and</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.090" end="00:04:17.580" style="s2">the testing has been really a really</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.730" end="00:04:20.130" style="s2">strong response on the on the part of</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.580" end="00:04:23.070" style="s2">labs in the states I mean on March 1st</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.130" end="00:04:26.100" style="s2">we produced I think about 266 tests and</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.070" end="00:04:27.360" style="s2">the ramp has been meteoric since then we</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.100" end="00:04:31.020" style="s2">are up to</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.360" end="00:04:34.500" style="s2">Oh has of yesterday sixty-five thousand</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.020" end="00:04:36.000" style="s2">deaths a day and that it&#39;s much higher</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.500" end="00:04:39.030" style="s2">than you know other countries out there</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.000" end="00:04:40.259" style="s2">you know Britain is trying to do four</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.030" end="00:04:42.360" style="s2">thousand a day I think they&#39;re under</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.259" end="00:04:43.979" style="s2">that trying to ramp Germany does about</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.360" end="00:04:46.560" style="s2">twelve thousand least delay the summers</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.979" end="00:04:48.810" style="s2">I saw and they&#39;re trying to ramp South</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.560" end="00:04:50.219" style="s2">Korea was ten to sixteen for quite a</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.810" end="00:04:53.729" style="s2">long time they I think they pushed it up</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.219" end="00:04:56.189" style="s2">to twenty just recently and so we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.729" end="00:04:59.009" style="s2">up to their level in terms of per</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.189" end="00:05:01.650" style="s2">million person you know million</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.009" end="00:05:03.090" style="s2">population but we&#39;re on the right</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.650" end="00:05:04.620" style="s2">trajectory were just we&#39;re just zooming</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.090" end="00:05:06.020" style="s2">it or hitting out of the park and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.620" end="00:05:09.479" style="s2">third thing was the medical</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.020" end="00:05:10.770" style="s2">manufacturing we let almost everything</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.479" end="00:05:12.870" style="s2">that manufactured in the medical field</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.770" end="00:05:14.580" style="s2">go off to China and other places and</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.870" end="00:05:16.740" style="s2">then we&#39;re caught flat-footed and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.580" end="00:05:18.379" style="s2">assumption that we&#39;d have months to ramp</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.740" end="00:05:22.139" style="s2">up our production and that you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.379" end="00:05:24.330" style="s2">relatively small amounts of strategic</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.139" end="00:05:25.889" style="s2">supplies or strategic stockpiles would</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.330" end="00:05:27.719" style="s2">be enough to get us through we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.889" end="00:05:31.020" style="s2">wrong I mean it is a you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.719" end="00:05:33.180" style="s2">come-as-you-are situation I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.020" end="00:05:35.909" style="s2">happened so fast they what you have on</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.180" end="00:05:37.500" style="s2">hand is what gets you through and our</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.909" end="00:05:39.449" style="s2">thinking and our planning assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.500" end="00:05:41.669" style="s2">we&#39;re all wrong and there wasn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.449" end="00:05:43.560" style="s2">anyone on the ball enough to actively</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.669" end="00:05:46.139" style="s2">update them as we were going it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.560" end="00:05:47.610" style="s2">too late by that point so but there has</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.139" end="00:05:49.169" style="s2">been a pretty good response in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.610" end="00:05:51.539" style="s2">ramping up production on masks and other</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.169" end="00:05:53.849" style="s2">things and then 3m is like doubled the</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.539" end="00:05:56.190" style="s2">production which is awesome and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.849" end="00:05:58.050" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of DIY alternatives that</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.190" end="00:06:00.680" style="s2">people are digging into I mean you can</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.050" end="00:06:02.969" style="s2">make a pretty good mask using cotton and</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.680" end="00:06:07.770" style="s2">vacuum cleaner bags and maybe a little</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.969" end="00:06:09.180" style="s2">bit of a floral wire or twistiest you</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.770" end="00:06:11.849" style="s2">know insert it in a way that allows you</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.180" end="00:06:13.259" style="s2">to pinch the mask around your nose so</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.849" end="00:06:14.520" style="s2">you can do a pretty good job there and</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.259" end="00:06:17.069" style="s2">know a lot of plans out there for doing</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.520" end="00:06:19.139" style="s2">that so that&#39;s the good side is that</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.069" end="00:06:20.940" style="s2">we&#39;re you know responding well still not</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.139" end="00:06:23.190" style="s2">as good as we could be on the flying</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.940" end="00:06:25.169" style="s2">side but you know in terms of production</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.190" end="00:06:26.849" style="s2">there&#39;s seem that kind of mobilization</p>

<p begin="00:06:47.530" end="00:06:51.220" style="s2">ask a couple questions about the good</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.700" end="00:06:53.290" style="s2">news though you know we look back and</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.220" end="00:06:56.230" style="s2">say what could we have done better one</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.290" end="00:07:00.480" style="s2">of the things really hops out to me is</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.230" end="00:07:03.640" style="s2">there was a very significant failure to</p>

<p begin="00:07:03.640" end="00:07:07.570" style="s2">chain in the intelligence that the</p>

<p begin="00:07:07.570" end="00:07:11.530" style="s2">the December and early January time</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.370" end="00:07:14.550" style="s2">frame where things are coming out now</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.530" end="00:07:16.990" style="s2">that is clear that analysts were</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.550" end="00:07:19.960" style="s2">forecasting that this will had a fair</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.990" end="00:07:21.460" style="s2">chance to become a global pandemic if we</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.960" end="00:07:24.540" style="s2">had spent ten million dollars in</p>

<p begin="00:07:24.540" end="00:07:29.260" style="s2">January and ramping up testing we&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.790" end="00:07:29.650" style="s2">in a very different place than we are</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.260" end="00:07:32.830" style="s2">today</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.650" end="00:07:35.070" style="s2">any thoughts on how these intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.830" end="00:07:37.930" style="s2">signals didn&#39;t get appropriately</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.070" end="00:07:41.470" style="s2">prioritized and escalated and turned</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.930" end="00:07:43.990" style="s2">into action yeah I think by late January</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.470" end="00:07:46.540" style="s2">there were a lot of intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.990" end="00:07:49.270" style="s2">briefings going out that said that this</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.540" end="00:07:50.290" style="s2">would become a pandemic in fact if you</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.270" end="00:07:52.000" style="s2">looked out on the net - there were</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.290" end="00:07:54.460" style="s2">people talking about it I wrote my</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.000" end="00:07:56.650" style="s2">January global Gorillaz report and</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.460" end="00:07:59.110" style="s2">entitled pandemic it was about this</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.650" end="00:08:01.660" style="s2">thing getting out of China and because</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.110" end="00:08:02.860" style="s2">of the way that is the virus acted it</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.660" end="00:08:04.840" style="s2">would it would zoom everywhere so there</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.860" end="00:08:06.690" style="s2">were signals out there but the</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.840" end="00:08:09.160" style="s2">assumption was that the planners the</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.690" end="00:08:12.580" style="s2">bureaucracy the people who did this and</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.160" end="00:08:14.200" style="s2">get paid for this would be able to pull</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.580" end="00:08:16.300" style="s2">it off pull off the response pull off</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.200" end="00:08:18.210" style="s2">the appropriate thing it&#39;s not like this</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.300" end="00:08:20.890" style="s2">is stuff it is all made up on the fly</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.210" end="00:08:22.030" style="s2">though you know like I said the planning</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.890" end="00:08:24.430" style="s2">assumptions that were built into the</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.030" end="00:08:26.320" style="s2">plants that we did have weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.430" end="00:08:29.200" style="s2">sufficient they were all geared to a</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.320" end="00:08:30.790" style="s2">pandemic of the 80s and 90s you know it</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.200" end="00:08:32.890" style="s2">people assume that they know that all</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.790" end="00:08:34.630" style="s2">this stuff is all you know maybe use of</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.890" end="00:08:36.700" style="s2">you know byproduct of being in the trump</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.630" end="00:08:39.880" style="s2">era that all of this is made up on the</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.700" end="00:08:41.440" style="s2">go but it&#39;s not I mean it&#39;s this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.880" end="00:08:43.150" style="s2">stuff that has been thought through when</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.440" end="00:08:45.820" style="s2">we paid billions for planning and</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.150" end="00:08:48.430" style="s2">efforts in preparation just for this</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.820" end="00:08:49.839" style="s2">moment then it all fell short yeah we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.430" end="00:08:51.430" style="s2">also didn&#39;t pull the trigger I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.839" end="00:08:52.060" style="s2">guess that my point was these signals</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.430" end="00:08:54.130" style="s2">were coming out</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.060" end="00:08:56.529" style="s2">you know light signals in December and</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.130" end="00:08:59.070" style="s2">stronger in January right and yet the</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.529" end="00:09:02.529" style="s2">powers that be did not really seem to</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.070" end="00:09:05.020" style="s2">understand the urgency until maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.529" end="00:09:06.779" style="s2">very last week in February the first</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.020" end="00:09:10.570" style="s2">week in January I mean that there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.779" end="00:09:13.180" style="s2">deep failure in intelligence coupled to</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.570" end="00:09:14.470" style="s2">executive action in that ran it the way</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.180" end="00:09:17.320" style="s2">oh yeah no definitely there was</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.470" end="00:09:18.370" style="s2">definitely a longer delay in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.320" end="00:09:20.620" style="s2">containment because there&#39;s I mean</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.370" end="00:09:22.210" style="s2">there&#39;s four layers to you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.620" end="00:09:24.640" style="s2">confronting the pandemic is the</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.210" end="00:09:26.170" style="s2">mitigation you know basically social</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.640" end="00:09:27.910" style="s2">distancing in school closures and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.170" end="00:09:29.529" style="s2">you do mostly on the decentralized side</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.910" end="00:09:31.720" style="s2">and then there&#39;s containment which is</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.529" end="00:09:33.580" style="s2">travel restrictions and that&#39;s where the</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.720" end="00:09:37.300" style="s2">presidency really could have played a</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.580" end="00:09:39.220" style="s2">much better role and then the isolation</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.300" end="00:09:41.589" style="s2">a case tracking that was all done</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.220" end="00:09:43.000" style="s2">through bureaucracy you know you need a</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.589" end="00:09:45.400" style="s2">lot of tests though and that needs</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.000" end="00:09:47.440" style="s2">industries participation to do that and</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.400" end="00:09:50.950" style="s2">then the final thing is quarantines I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.440" end="00:09:52.990" style="s2">more concerned now is about the big</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.950" end="00:09:55.660" style="s2">negative is is just a scattershot</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.990" end="00:09:57.250" style="s2">approach to containing it I mean we have</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.660" end="00:10:00.010" style="s2">a couple big states taking extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.250" end="00:10:02.860" style="s2">measures too late Cuomo trying to you</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.010" end="00:10:04.900" style="s2">know compensate for de Blasio&#39;s delay in</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.860" end="00:10:07.720" style="s2">taking measures but most of the states</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.900" end="00:10:10.120" style="s2">are doing almost nothing and this is</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.720" end="00:10:11.800" style="s2">kind of a situation it&#39;s like um you</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.120" end="00:10:14.140" style="s2">know we&#39;re headed towards based on most</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.800" end="00:10:18.220" style="s2">estimates you know 50% reduction in GDP</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.140" end="00:10:20.650" style="s2">and a 30% unemployment level within a</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.220" end="00:10:22.060" style="s2">month at this rate you know with most of</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.650" end="00:10:24.190" style="s2">the major economies of the you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.060" end="00:10:27.460" style="s2">within the United States a you know shut</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.190" end="00:10:29.890" style="s2">down and quarantined the timer has been</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.460" end="00:10:33.339" style="s2">set you know the longer this persists</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.890" end="00:10:35.200" style="s2">the the more likely that bad effect will</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.339" end="00:10:37.360" style="s2">be kind of locked in will be actually in</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.200" end="00:10:41.200" style="s2">a depression even if we get a hold of</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.360" end="00:10:44.920" style="s2">the virus and all of this delay is just</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.200" end="00:10:47.980" style="s2">lengthening at a time to return to</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.920" end="00:10:50.200" style="s2">normal economic operation so it&#39;s better</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.980" end="00:10:52.330" style="s2">trying to take all of the pain upfront</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.200" end="00:10:54.820" style="s2">or as close to up front as you can by</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.330" end="00:10:59.290" style="s2">taking measures early and we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.820" end="00:11:01.390" style="s2">doing that there&#39;s a lot of if not only</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.290" end="00:11:04.550" style="s2">just States saying no it&#39;s also even</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.390" end="00:11:06.940" style="s2">within states there&#39;s some states</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.550" end="00:11:10.010" style="s2">of real problems enforcing quarantines</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.940" end="00:11:12.290" style="s2">enforcing measures now people are out</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.010" end="00:11:15.230" style="s2">and goofing off and doing whatever they</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.290" end="00:11:17.029" style="s2">do and I mean I think the attitudes</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.230" end="00:11:19.670" style="s2">towards those people will shift over the</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.029" end="00:11:21.700" style="s2">next couple weeks from you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.670" end="00:11:24.200" style="s2">just stupid or that&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.700" end="00:11:26.209" style="s2">inconsiderate or that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.200" end="00:11:27.890" style="s2">towards wait a second those folks are</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.209" end="00:11:29.240" style="s2">setting us up for a depression because</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.890" end="00:11:31.310" style="s2">this couldn&#39;t lengthen this and the more</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.240" end="00:11:33.019" style="s2">at length since the recovery effort the</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.310" end="00:11:35.240" style="s2">more likely we&#39;re going to lose income</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.019" end="00:11:37.370" style="s2">and not have a job coming out of this</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.240" end="00:11:39.320" style="s2">and those people are actually stealing</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.370" end="00:11:41.390" style="s2">from me let alone putting putting</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.320" end="00:11:42.980" style="s2">relatives at risk or putting me at risk</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.390" end="00:11:44.029" style="s2">they won&#39;t come back to that talk a</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.980" end="00:11:46.459" style="s2">little bit about the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.029" end="00:11:47.779" style="s2">psychology of these people but before</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.459" end="00:11:50.120" style="s2">that do you have any updates or any</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.779" end="00:11:52.250" style="s2">sense of what&#39;s going on and say</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.120" end="00:11:55.070" style="s2">California who blew the whistle first</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.250" end="00:11:56.660" style="s2">and shut the whole state down for six</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.070" end="00:11:58.339" style="s2">counties and then the whole state is</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.660" end="00:12:00.740" style="s2">there any data coming out of California</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.339" end="00:12:02.690" style="s2">yet to show that we&#39;re bending the</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.740" end="00:12:05.360" style="s2">curves I mean if this is actually being</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.690" end="00:12:08.600" style="s2">done it almost has to but I have seen</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.360" end="00:12:11.180" style="s2">nothing on the data front yet I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.600" end="00:12:12.829" style="s2">seen that yet in California somebody was</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.180" end="00:12:14.600" style="s2">just sending me data from New York and</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.829" end="00:12:16.040" style="s2">saying that three-day rolling average in</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.600" end="00:12:18.380" style="s2">New York is starting to curve around in</p>

<p begin="00:12:21.050" end="00:12:25.310" style="s2">been sucking up a lot of the country&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.550" end="00:12:28.250" style="s2">tests and they&#39;ve taken it seriously at</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.310" end="00:12:29.959" style="s2">least at the state level but there&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.250" end="00:12:32.420" style="s2">know a lot of non-compliance at the New</p>

<p begin="00:12:34.850" end="00:12:39.829" style="s2">transmission that&#39;s occurring in that</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.350" end="00:12:42.020" style="s2">space but yeah I think I think New York</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.829" end="00:12:45.320" style="s2">is probably showing the the earliest</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.020" end="00:12:48.170" style="s2">signs of a turnaround the Boston area</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.320" end="00:12:49.880" style="s2">was you know early in its ability to you</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.170" end="00:12:53.000" style="s2">know move from one of the four initial</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.880" end="00:12:55.070" style="s2">epicenters to to kind of an also-ran in</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.000" end="00:12:56.870" style="s2">number of cases and deaths but the</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.070" end="00:12:58.459" style="s2">pressure from kind of the bleed out from</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.870" end="00:13:00.949" style="s2">New York is pretty intense</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.459" end="00:13:04.250" style="s2">just being next to that mega epicenter</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.949" end="00:13:07.430" style="s2">is it&#39;s going to wear on Massachusetts</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.250" end="00:13:09.829" style="s2">and and upper New England other</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.430" end="00:13:11.449" style="s2">everywhere else it looks pretty much out</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.829" end="00:13:13.310" style="s2">of control the one that worries me the</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.449" end="00:13:17.450" style="s2">most right now is New Jersey</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.310" end="00:13:20.060" style="s2">it&#39;s wow it&#39;s got a inverted</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.450" end="00:13:23.240" style="s2">testing system it&#39;s like twenty haight</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.060" end="00:13:26.210" style="s2">hundred positives for 300 all right 300</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.240" end="00:13:27.980" style="s2">negatives in it&#39;s like wow I mean talk</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.210" end="00:13:29.570" style="s2">about under testing virtually every</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.980" end="00:13:31.670" style="s2">person they give the test who has it</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.570" end="00:13:33.950" style="s2">that&#39;s scary yeah at this stage that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.670" end="00:13:36.590" style="s2">crazy ought to be at least 90% positive</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.950" end="00:13:37.940" style="s2">negative zat this point oh yeah most of</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.590" end="00:13:41.150" style="s2">the states you know a lot of states are</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.940" end="00:13:42.830" style="s2">in that you know 90% negative space but</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.150" end="00:13:44.750" style="s2">Wow New Jersey I just something</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.830" end="00:13:46.750" style="s2">seriously went wrong there and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.750" end="00:13:49.190" style="s2">surged you gone into a full lockdown yet</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.750" end="00:13:50.960" style="s2">not that I&#39;ve seen it&#39;s just a couple</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.190" end="00:13:52.850" style="s2">days ago I saw some news saying that</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.960" end="00:13:54.560" style="s2">they were fighting to keep the casinos</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.850" end="00:13:57.560" style="s2">open so I don&#39;t think the news has</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.560" end="00:13:59.990" style="s2">gotten to them yet well let&#39;s talk about</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.560" end="00:14:02.810" style="s2">this I mean we&#39;ve learned a lot and</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.990" end="00:14:06.290" style="s2">we&#39;re I&#39;m for sure processing lots of</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.810" end="00:14:09.230" style="s2">things from this whole you know once in</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.290" end="00:14:11.090" style="s2">a hundred year episode but the one to my</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.230" end="00:14:14.480" style="s2">mind its most striking is what I would</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.090" end="00:14:16.790" style="s2">say how highlighted it it has made the</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.480" end="00:14:19.870" style="s2">issue of cognitive differences amongst</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.790" end="00:14:22.490" style="s2">people even people you know similar</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.870" end="00:14:25.690" style="s2">nominal intelligence there&#39;s some people</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.490" end="00:14:29.180" style="s2">who immediately get it they understand</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.690" end="00:14:31.040" style="s2">what an exponential is you know that the</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.180" end="00:14:33.050" style="s2">current case loads two weeks ago didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.040" end="00:14:35.600" style="s2">mean jack shit because the low testing</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.050" end="00:14:37.580" style="s2">rates and started taking very strong</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.600" end="00:14:39.530" style="s2">actions and then there are other people</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.580" end="00:14:41.630" style="s2">who are you know still you know going</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.530" end="00:14:45.230" style="s2">out to restaurants or buy and take out</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.630" end="00:14:46.910" style="s2">sandwiches or what-have-you and you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.230" end="00:14:48.110" style="s2">say by everything we know about them in</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.910" end="00:14:49.550" style="s2">terms of their career and their</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.110" end="00:14:51.350" style="s2">background their aptitude they should</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.550" end="00:14:55.370" style="s2">have come to similar conclusions but</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.350" end="00:14:59.720" style="s2">they didn&#39;t great any sense of of was</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.370" end="00:15:04.700" style="s2">all about yeah I think we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.720" end="00:15:06.200" style="s2">seeing how network dynamics works in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.700" end="00:15:08.720" style="s2">you know modern crisis I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.200" end="00:15:11.990" style="s2">really kind of giving us all a lesson in</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.720" end="00:15:13.250" style="s2">it you know it&#39;s I&#39;m still trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.990" end="00:15:15.410" style="s2">my head around it I mean I was just</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.250" end="00:15:17.690" style="s2">working on the whole idea of you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.410" end="00:15:19.460" style="s2">what happens when you have you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.690" end="00:15:22.130" style="s2">whole population network or</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.460" end="00:15:24.140" style="s2">socio-economic network like ours in</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.130" end="00:15:26.540" style="s2">siege mode and they kind of locks itself</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.140" end="00:15:28.370" style="s2">in through these you know network</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.540" end="00:15:30.920" style="s2">connections into this like I can&#39;t spend</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.370" end="00:15:31.190" style="s2">money I can&#39;t go out even when you lift</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.920" end="00:15:32.570" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.190" end="00:15:34.850" style="s2">restrictions how do you get that thing</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.570" end="00:15:36.770" style="s2">moving again and that you have to</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.850" end="00:15:39.200" style="s2">rethink everything you know about the</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.770" end="00:15:41.300" style="s2">way we did economic bailouts in the past</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.200" end="00:15:43.750" style="s2">you know the old bailout system is all</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.300" end="00:15:45.980" style="s2">kind of interest group driven and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.750" end="00:15:48.530" style="s2">usually some kind of power law</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.980" end="00:15:51.710" style="s2">distribution where you know 1% get 40%</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.530" end="00:15:54.980" style="s2">you know the top 20 get 80 to 90% of all</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.710" end="00:15:57.320" style="s2">the money it has really little effect</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.980" end="00:16:01.280" style="s2">and I&#39;m moving the entire network and</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.320" end="00:16:05.210" style="s2">after the financial crisis we saw that</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.280" end="00:16:07.820" style="s2">that you know cause like a 10-year kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.210" end="00:16:09.590" style="s2">of dig out that to get out of that kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.820" end="00:16:11.720" style="s2">of you know under siege mentality and</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.590" end="00:16:13.610" style="s2">this one&#39;s going to be much worse so I</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.720" end="00:16:16.240" style="s2">was thinking about ways actually get</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.610" end="00:16:19.190" style="s2">that whole network to shift</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.240" end="00:16:21.320" style="s2">simultaneously and go positive and it</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.190" end="00:16:23.570" style="s2">would you know that the stimulus program</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.320" end="00:16:28.340" style="s2">would have to be universal or inclusive</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.570" end="00:16:30.080" style="s2">everybody so kind of a consensus that we</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.340" end="00:16:33.140" style="s2">all can come around and that would go</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.080" end="00:16:37.160" style="s2">into a you know a positive towards our</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.140" end="00:16:39.140" style="s2">cohesion and then more cohesion means</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.160" end="00:16:42.100" style="s2">better coherence in terms of our</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.140" end="00:16:44.660" style="s2">decision-making and then it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.100" end="00:16:46.250" style="s2">significant relative to the the problem</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.660" end="00:16:47.660" style="s2">that you know has to be big enough that</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.250" end="00:16:49.610" style="s2">catches people&#39;s attention it has to</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.660" end="00:16:51.680" style="s2">have some duration like if you were</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.610" end="00:16:54.380" style="s2">getting like an emergency UVI you&#39;d get</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.680" end="00:16:56.750" style="s2">a you know $1,000 a month or the next</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.380" end="00:16:57.920" style="s2">year or two years and you know that that</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.750" end="00:16:59.480" style="s2">thing would be there and you could plan</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.920" end="00:17:01.940" style="s2">against it and then take action in your</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.480" end="00:17:03.770" style="s2">life that would allow you to utilize</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.940" end="00:17:05.959" style="s2">that resource which then you know lost</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.770" end="00:17:10.100" style="s2">people to dig out and then you know they</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.959" end="00:17:13.730" style="s2">have some you know positive and Pro</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.100" end="00:17:14.660" style="s2">building economic activity going on in</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.730" end="00:17:16.610" style="s2">their life and there&#39;s lots of other</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.660" end="00:17:20.689" style="s2">little ones I put in and put into my I</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.610" end="00:17:22.730" style="s2">started a pandemic 2020 working space</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.689" end="00:17:24.140" style="s2">where I just every day I have put more</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.730" end="00:17:26.120" style="s2">stuff in and that was one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.140" end="00:17:28.520" style="s2">I was working on this morning but this</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.120" end="00:17:30.890" style="s2">this this group it&#39;s interesting because</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.520" end="00:17:32.510" style="s2">we didn&#39;t have like the federal</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.890" end="00:17:34.940" style="s2">government come down and say okay</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.510" end="00:17:36.790" style="s2">everybody go into quarantine it was a</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.940" end="00:17:38.780" style="s2">decentralized decision making process a</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.790" end="00:17:40.610" style="s2">Merrill you mean think it&#39;s hard to even</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.780" end="00:17:41.630" style="s2">think of the authority mechanism that</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.610" end="00:17:44.020" style="s2">they would use to do that</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.630" end="00:17:44.020" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.809" end="00:17:46.909" style="s2">unlike you know all these other</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.889" end="00:17:50.870" style="s2">countries where everything came down</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.909" end="00:17:53.600" style="s2">from on high what is driving the the</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.870" end="00:17:56.120" style="s2">quarantine is that we have a network of</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.600" end="00:17:57.440" style="s2">people who have decided based on you</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.120" end="00:17:58.879" style="s2">know going through the evidence and</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.440" end="00:18:01.399" style="s2">going through the information that that</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.879" end="00:18:04.190" style="s2">we need to take drastic action they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.399" end="00:18:07.009" style="s2">come to that consensus decision and and</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.190" end="00:18:10.759" style="s2">they&#39;re pushing their states to take</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.009" end="00:18:12.889" style="s2">action and that decision and and and the</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.759" end="00:18:15.019" style="s2">amount of economic value that this group</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.889" end="00:18:17.419" style="s2">generates puts us on a path towards</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.019" end="00:18:19.159" style="s2">quarantine and you know putting the</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.419" end="00:18:21.769" style="s2">economy on hold until the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.159" end="00:18:23.720" style="s2">solved now you have what we&#39;ve seen in</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.769" end="00:18:25.490" style="s2">the you know Internet and the network is</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.720" end="00:18:27.799" style="s2">that this free information flow allows a</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.490" end="00:18:29.840" style="s2">lot of outliers to develop networks a</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.799" end="00:18:31.789" style="s2">cluster set of people who are thinking</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.840" end="00:18:33.610" style="s2">it you know differently and they can</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.789" end="00:18:36.740" style="s2">self reinforce or you know they can</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.610" end="00:18:40.220" style="s2">reinforce each other and they can often</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.740" end="00:18:41.960" style="s2">stake out an alternative position and in</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.220" end="00:18:44.360" style="s2">this case they&#39;ve taken positions that</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.960" end="00:18:48.110" style="s2">are contrary to that larger network now</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.360" end="00:18:50.450" style="s2">here&#39;s the problem is that the this kind</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.110" end="00:18:52.029" style="s2">of outlier position and at least when</p>

<p begin="00:20:19.750" end="00:20:23.320" style="s2">around and I talked to was talking to</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.550" end="00:20:25.450" style="s2">Jordan about this it&#39;s like there&#39;s no</p>

<p begin="00:20:33.490" end="00:20:37.480" style="s2">and and it keeps you know the market</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.680" end="00:20:39.520" style="s2">buoyed enough and keeps us see keeps the</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.480" end="00:20:41.590" style="s2">whole thing greased in the right way so</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.520" end="00:20:44.590" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t seize up and then you have</p>

<p begin="00:20:48.730" end="00:20:53.560" style="s2">know giving them enough money that they</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.320" end="00:20:55.030" style="s2">don&#39;t cleave off completely and then you</p>

<p begin="00:20:55.030" end="00:20:59.380" style="s2">work where that you can get this network</p>

<p begin="00:20:59.380" end="00:21:06.490" style="s2">siege or or the en masse kind of make a</p>

<p begin="00:21:06.490" end="00:21:11.230" style="s2">those other mechanisms or it takes a</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.950" end="00:21:13.630" style="s2">long time to kind of unlock them from</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.230" end="00:21:15.640" style="s2">that men the kind of the network health</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.630" end="00:21:17.290" style="s2">the you know of our socio-economic socio</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.640" end="00:21:18.700" style="s2">political system there&#39;s no one no one</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.290" end="00:21:20.140" style="s2">really addressing that I mean we have a</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.700" end="00:21:23.140" style="s2">little you know you can do with maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.140" end="00:21:25.300" style="s2">little bit on Facebook in terms of mass</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.140" end="00:21:28.180" style="s2">messaging and and and simple kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.300" end="00:21:30.190" style="s2">nudging and persuasion but you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.180" end="00:21:31.510" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a new model emerging</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.190" end="00:21:33.640" style="s2">here just have to figure out all the</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.510" end="00:21:34.810" style="s2">levers on it and also we&#39;re operating</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.640" end="00:21:37.180" style="s2">and you know there&#39;s something you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.810" end="00:21:38.710" style="s2">written a whole lot about and you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.180" end="00:21:41.650" style="s2">I&#39;ve been interested in it as well which</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.710" end="00:21:44.370" style="s2">is the emergences of these highly</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.650" end="00:21:47.460" style="s2">decentralized sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.370" end="00:21:50.380" style="s2">networks and unfortunately those are</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.460" end="00:21:52.090" style="s2">partially maladaptive to the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.380" end="00:21:55.090" style="s2">situation we currently have well right</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.090" end="00:21:57.730" style="s2">we&#39;re coherence and at least anecdotally</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.090" end="00:22:00.820" style="s2">I would say pretty large and anecdotally</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.730" end="00:22:02.770" style="s2">for people I&#39;ve interacted with the not</p>

<p begin="00:22:02.770" end="00:22:07.750" style="s2">preparation etc seems strongly</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.710" end="00:22:09.380" style="s2">correlated with membership or</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.750" end="00:22:12.470" style="s2">association with</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.380" end="00:22:16.130" style="s2">those particularly red Republican</p>

<p begin="00:22:16.130" end="00:22:19.490" style="s2">sense making networks that seemed to</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.540" end="00:22:21.820" style="s2">have not made sense the fact they made</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.490" end="00:22:24.350" style="s2">anti sense and some of them still are</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.820" end="00:22:27.380" style="s2">early Trump adopters are pretty much all</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.350" end="00:22:29.300" style="s2">on the pandemic front yeah a few of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.380" end="00:22:31.960" style="s2">good ones are like Bannon and Qurna</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.300" end="00:22:34.400" style="s2">bitch and guys like that yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.960" end="00:22:37.250" style="s2">frankly it was Tucker Carlson who I</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.400" end="00:22:39.140" style="s2">think finally sat that idiot trump down</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.250" end="00:22:42.080" style="s2">and smacked him across the face for two</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.140" end="00:22:43.310" style="s2">hours and made him pay attention but</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.080" end="00:22:46.910" style="s2">unfortunately when you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.310" end="00:22:49.070" style="s2">topology of the the red collective sense</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.910" end="00:22:50.600" style="s2">making networks the main repeater is</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.070" end="00:22:52.220" style="s2">Trump you know things circularly they</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.600" end="00:22:53.930" style="s2">can circulate up through various layers</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.220" end="00:22:55.700" style="s2">and they get up the Trump then he</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.930" end="00:22:58.220" style="s2">broadcasts and then they go back out and</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.700" end="00:23:01.280" style="s2">become modified and evolved but that</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.220" end="00:23:03.590" style="s2">motherfucker never got it he still</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.280" end="00:23:07.910" style="s2">hasn&#39;t gotten it and if he were a strong</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.590" end="00:23:09.980" style="s2">decisive leader he could Co here the red</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.910" end="00:23:11.960" style="s2">collective intelligence networks you</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.980" end="00:23:14.840" style="s2">know back on board much more rapidly so</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.960" end="00:23:17.780" style="s2">it seems to me a grotesque failure of</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.840" end="00:23:20.990" style="s2">top-level leadership by the president</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.780" end="00:23:23.030" style="s2">yeah I think I read it a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.990" end="00:23:24.530" style="s2">differently I mean not that it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.030" end="00:23:26.630" style="s2">know I think he&#39;s making a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.530" end="00:23:28.760" style="s2">wrong decisions but also I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.630" end="00:23:33.130" style="s2">more like okay for instance last night</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.760" end="00:23:33.130" style="s2">he was talking about ending the crisis</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.730" end="00:23:40.570" style="s2">yeah but that yeah the way I read it is</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.800" end="00:23:43.070" style="s2">that he&#39;s actually bad as a negotiation</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.570" end="00:23:44.960" style="s2">or you know as part of his negotiation</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.070" end="00:23:48.140" style="s2">with with the Democrats for his</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.960" end="00:23:52.250" style="s2">bailout package because if you won&#39;t let</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.140" end="00:23:54.380" style="s2">me solve this crisis using my bailout</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.250" end="00:23:56.750" style="s2">package then let&#39;s just to solve the</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.380" end="00:23:59.150" style="s2">crisis and it&#39;s it&#39;s a crazy position</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.750" end="00:24:01.250" style="s2">it&#39;s right out of his negotiation kind</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.150" end="00:24:02.630" style="s2">of handbook you know it&#39;s a the art of</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.250" end="00:24:04.940" style="s2">the deal it&#39;s you know take a crazy</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.630" end="00:24:07.430" style="s2">position and convinced me to move off of</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.940" end="00:24:10.340" style="s2">it and then and when I do you&#39;re happy</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.430" end="00:24:11.810" style="s2">with what I give you and he&#39;s done that</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.340" end="00:24:14.360" style="s2">a couple of times during this crisis</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.810" end="00:24:16.700" style="s2">this is one of them oh yeah understand</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.360" end="00:24:18.860" style="s2">that this is wartime this is not some</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.700" end="00:24:21.110" style="s2">sleazy real-estate deal Atlantic City</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.860" end="00:24:23.480" style="s2">we&#39;re dealing with lives of millions of</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.110" end="00:24:26.630" style="s2">people here and we can&#39;t be playing the</p>

<p begin="00:24:26.630" end="00:24:31.120" style="s2">know I never liked Trump I&#39;ve always</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.970" end="00:24:33.470" style="s2">despised him as a human being but this</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.120" end="00:24:36.370" style="s2">crisis has brought out him at his</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.470" end="00:24:39.019" style="s2">absolute worse I mean you know that</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.370" end="00:24:40.789" style="s2">unbelievably evil little snide remark</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.019" end="00:24:44.029" style="s2">about Romney what is wrong with that man</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.789" end="00:24:45.559" style="s2">right hopefully this will be a huge</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.029" end="00:24:48.200" style="s2">lesson to the American people</p>

<p begin="00:24:55.460" end="00:25:01.669" style="s2">approval for and on the crisis is in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.860" end="00:25:03.039" style="s2">50s now so it&#39;s exactly having the</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.669" end="00:25:06.080" style="s2">opposite effect</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.039" end="00:25:07.850" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s an interesting thing I mean</p>

<p begin="00:27:33.260" end="00:27:36.410" style="s2">departments could literally hand these</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.520" end="00:27:38.570" style="s2">cards out on the street take a biometric</p>

<p begin="00:27:42.560" end="00:27:46.700" style="s2">good so what the hell fuck and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.300" end="00:27:49.220" style="s2">that the cards have a 45-day time to</p>

<p begin="00:27:56.240" end="00:28:02.270" style="s2">aren&#39;t subject to you know the famous</p>

<p begin="00:28:02.270" end="00:28:07.190" style="s2">some ways is a good thing in a situation</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.400" end="00:28:10.040" style="s2">like this if everybody saves we all die</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.190" end="00:28:13.310" style="s2">or the economy dies so the beauty of</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.040" end="00:28:15.080" style="s2">specific cards and a new card sent out</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.310" end="00:28:18.320" style="s2">monthly yes it raises the cost a little</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.080" end="00:28:21.440" style="s2">bit but the time to live on the money on</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.320" end="00:28:22.910" style="s2">each card provides a huge force to get</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.440" end="00:28:25.700" style="s2">people to actually get that damn thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.910" end="00:28:27.230" style="s2">into the economy I mean there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.700" end="00:28:28.460" style="s2">a lot of little private currencies had</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.230" end="00:28:30.620" style="s2">that same kind of thing it was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.460" end="00:28:32.870" style="s2">like a negative interest rate de Mirage</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.620" end="00:28:35.450" style="s2">as we call it ya de Mirage exactly and</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.870" end="00:28:37.280" style="s2">you know it kind of gets you to spend</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.450" end="00:28:39.650" style="s2">them this is more brutal though this is</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.280" end="00:28:41.960" style="s2">a clip 45 where it goes back into the</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.650" end="00:28:45.080" style="s2">common pool and put it right on the card</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.960" end="00:28:47.300" style="s2">this money expires on say the April</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.080" end="00:28:50.210" style="s2">first card expires on May 15 put alright</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.300" end="00:28:51.200" style="s2">on the card and I think you know that</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.210" end="00:28:53.600" style="s2">way we get rid of</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.200" end="00:28:55.309" style="s2">all needs for fancy new systems we can</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.600" end="00:28:58.429" style="s2">deal with everybody from the homeless to</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.309" end="00:29:01.250" style="s2">you know the regular homeowner we can</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.429" end="00:29:02.750" style="s2">run it as many months as we need to it</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.250" end="00:29:04.429" style="s2">does have a little bit higher operations</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.750" end="00:29:06.500" style="s2">cost but it seems to me at this point a</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.429" end="00:29:09.200" style="s2">little bit higher operations costs is</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.500" end="00:29:11.929" style="s2">way superior to taking you know systems</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.200" end="00:29:12.950" style="s2">development risks fancy processing risks</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.929" end="00:29:14.480" style="s2">that a lot of people aren&#39;t going to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.950" end="00:29:15.559" style="s2">able to hop through quickly because</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.480" end="00:29:18.769" style="s2">they&#39;re not supposed to leave the house</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.559" end="00:29:20.960" style="s2">etc so I think the big thing here too is</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.769" end="00:29:23.990" style="s2">that if you really look at this like a</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.960" end="00:29:25.970" style="s2">emergency ubi over two years in you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.990" end="00:29:28.100" style="s2">conjunction with this crisis and what it</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.970" end="00:29:29.210" style="s2">can do I mean it cost the price tag</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.100" end="00:29:32.059" style="s2">quite a little over four trillion</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.210" end="00:29:34.580" style="s2">dollars it&#39;s a lot but you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.059" end="00:29:36.590" style="s2">borrowing at 30% or borrowing 30 years</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.580" end="00:29:38.570" style="s2">at less than 1% is it&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.590" end="00:29:41.659" style="s2">attractive in in terms of financing it</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.570" end="00:29:43.460" style="s2">but I think unlike those all of these</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.659" end="00:29:44.870" style="s2">bail out bills and these multi there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.460" end="00:29:46.519" style="s2">the one that the Democrats are proposing</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.870" end="00:29:50.330" style="s2">you&#39;re two and a half trillion so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.519" end="00:29:52.490" style="s2">you&#39;re almost there unlike those this</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.330" end="00:29:54.679" style="s2">would have a very strong ROI and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.490" end="00:29:57.230" style="s2">any kind of like real stimulus a real</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.679" end="00:29:59.179" style="s2">kind of paddles to the to the chest of</p>

<p begin="00:30:06.110" end="00:30:09.590" style="s2">focus you know that this thing is</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.340" end="00:30:11.870" style="s2">actually generating two three four five</p>

<p begin="00:31:21.230" end="00:31:25.310" style="s2">Americans let them invest that that</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.240" end="00:31:28.100" style="s2">money you know you know three hundred</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.310" end="00:31:30.020" style="s2">and twenty actually probably two hundred</p>

<p begin="00:31:38.510" end="00:31:42.350" style="s2">were focusing in on unbaling money</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.610" end="00:31:43.790" style="s2">yeah the Democrats errors they want to</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.350" end="00:31:45.290" style="s2">give it to the state-level bureaucrats</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.790" end="00:31:47.000" style="s2">the Republican errors they want to give</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.290" end="00:31:49.760" style="s2">it to big corporations most of whom it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.000" end="00:31:51.320" style="s2">inappropriate for and the real answer is</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.760" end="00:31:53.330" style="s2">to give it to the fucking people right</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.320" end="00:31:54.920" style="s2">that&#39;s the answer you know all the</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.330" end="00:31:56.570" style="s2">people listen to the show call your</p>

<p begin="00:31:56.570" end="00:32:00.020" style="s2">that eighty percent at least of this</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.610" end="00:32:02.210" style="s2">money needs to be in the form of</p>

<p begin="00:32:02.210" end="00:32:06.110" style="s2">to the people</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.900" end="00:32:08.270" style="s2">monthly let me talk briefly about the</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.110" end="00:32:10.010" style="s2">corporate side you know Airlines that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.270" end="00:32:11.690" style="s2">ridiculous we shouldn&#39;t be giving any</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.010" end="00:32:13.640" style="s2">money to the airline companies because</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.690" end="00:32:16.460" style="s2">we airline companies have come and gone</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.640" end="00:32:18.890" style="s2">forever the key thing about airlines are</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.460" end="00:32:22.730" style="s2">the airplanes the pilots the mechanic</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.890" end="00:32:24.890" style="s2">the stewardess the gates etc and those</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.730" end="00:32:26.810" style="s2">things get recombined into new economic</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.890" end="00:32:28.550" style="s2">entities the shareholders and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.810" end="00:32:31.490" style="s2">bondholders take it up the poop chute oh</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.550" end="00:32:32.990" style="s2">well that&#39;s life the actual elements</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.490" end="00:32:35.600" style="s2">that you need to run an airline or</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.990" end="00:32:38.030" style="s2">physical intangible and survive any</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.600" end="00:32:39.770" style="s2">failure the only the only companies we</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.030" end="00:32:42.800" style="s2">should be investing in are ones with</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.770" end="00:32:47.990" style="s2">very deep intellectual property creation</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.800" end="00:32:50.780" style="s2">stacks like Boeing like Intel like the</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.990" end="00:32:52.760" style="s2">automobile companies and I&#39;m sure Harma</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.780" end="00:32:54.380" style="s2">suitable although they&#39;re not gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.760" end="00:32:56.570" style="s2">a problem probably but we should that we</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.380" end="00:32:57.950" style="s2">should not be trucking is another</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.570" end="00:33:00.200" style="s2">example yeah trucking sneaking it up</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.950" end="00:33:02.300" style="s2">taking it on the chin oh well</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.200" end="00:33:05.740" style="s2">trucking companies also come and go at a</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.300" end="00:33:08.390" style="s2">very high rate and trucks will be</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.740" end="00:33:09.770" style="s2">recombined and with drivers under new</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.390" end="00:33:11.510" style="s2">corporate umbrellas it will be debt-free</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.770" end="00:33:12.890" style="s2">because the old ones were wiped out the</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.510" end="00:33:15.290" style="s2">trucks were bought for twenty cents on</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.890" end="00:33:17.900" style="s2">the dollar so ridiculous for the feds to</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.290" end="00:33:18.890" style="s2">try to pump prop up trucking companies</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.900" end="00:33:22.130" style="s2">but trucking companies</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.890" end="00:33:25.070" style="s2">a huge lobby as do airlines and so again</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.130" end="00:33:27.860" style="s2">let&#39;s tell our elected officials really</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.070" end="00:33:31.160" style="s2">think smart about what industries we</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.860" end="00:33:32.510" style="s2">must have that we lose the capability if</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.160" end="00:33:34.910" style="s2">we let them go away and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.510" end="00:33:37.520" style="s2">basically only the deep IP stack</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.910" end="00:33:41.120" style="s2">companies you know like the Boeing isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.520" end="00:33:43.460" style="s2">like the Intel&#39;s and let&#39;s not take the</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.120" end="00:33:44.960" style="s2">asset recombination companies and prop</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.460" end="00:33:46.910" style="s2">them up because frankly we get that a</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.960" end="00:33:48.290" style="s2">refactoring for free and frankly those</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.910" end="00:33:50.510" style="s2">industries will be better off once</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.290" end="00:33:53.660" style="s2">they&#39;re refracted away and free from</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.510" end="00:33:54.560" style="s2">debt correct I agree it&#39;s it gets more</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.660" end="00:33:57.290" style="s2">interesting when you look at</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.560" end="00:34:00.110" style="s2">universities yeah well yeah do you keep</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.290" end="00:34:02.030" style="s2">do you you know do you help them make</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.110" end="00:34:04.820" style="s2">the transition to doing more of what</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.030" end="00:34:06.940" style="s2">they do online and a lot of that</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.820" end="00:34:10.000" style="s2">physical plant and a lot of that</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.940" end="00:34:13.429" style="s2">personnel kind of overhead becomes</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.000" end="00:34:15.679" style="s2">unneeded do you help them restructure I</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.429" end="00:34:17.120" style="s2">think we probably have to but whether</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.679" end="00:34:19.159" style="s2">they should be the ones to restructure</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.120" end="00:34:21.500" style="s2">or not I&#39;m not so sure tell you the</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.159" end="00:34:22.669" style="s2">truth you know they&#39;re if they</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.500" end="00:34:25.550" style="s2">restructure they&#39;re gonna do it a</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.669" end="00:34:27.620" style="s2">ponderous self-serving way so I think</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.550" end="00:34:29.929" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna reserve judgment on whether</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.620" end="00:34:33.470" style="s2">they should be provided a massive</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.929" end="00:34:35.450" style="s2">bailout to transition or competitors</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.470" end="00:34:38.179" style="s2">ought to be allowed to rise up and take</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.450" end="00:34:40.100" style="s2">their market share right or making it</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.179" end="00:34:42.169" style="s2">easier to get high-quality degrees</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.100" end="00:34:44.270" style="s2">online because everyone&#39;s really just</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.169" end="00:34:46.190" style="s2">after the certificate ring well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.270" end="00:34:48.980" style="s2">unfortunate in which case they shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.190" end="00:34:51.380" style="s2">waste their time you know you know a</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.980" end="00:34:53.380" style="s2">guild type certifications is what my</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.380" end="00:34:55.850" style="s2">view the game B world will be about</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.380" end="00:34:57.860" style="s2">where there&#39;ll be guilds for every</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.850" end="00:34:59.900" style="s2">occupation and it&#39;ll be their job to</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.860" end="00:35:01.880" style="s2">certify people within their guild and</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.900" end="00:35:04.250" style="s2">pay scales will typically be within</p>

<p begin="00:35:05.960" end="00:35:12.110" style="s2">level four that means you&#39;re between 70</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.810" end="00:35:14.240" style="s2">and 100 and 105 dollars an hour and your</p>

<p begin="00:35:14.240" end="00:35:17.870" style="s2">and if they&#39;re not doing a good job</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.410" end="00:35:19.490" style="s2">certifying the guild rate people will</p>
