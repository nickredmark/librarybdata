<p begin="00:00:05.600" end="00:00:13.740" style="s2">so this is a third podcast and yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.250" end="00:00:15.450" style="s2">the last one we offered a constructive</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.740" end="00:00:19.560" style="s2">critique of John Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.450" end="00:00:21.330" style="s2">and in this one we&#39;re going to go</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.560" end="00:00:25.260" style="s2">through some of the comments the</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.330" end="00:00:27.810" style="s2">feedback underneath the video and and</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.260" end="00:00:30.599" style="s2">else we&#39;re trying give a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.810" end="00:00:32.820" style="s2">context and respond to what some are</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.599" end="00:00:38.040" style="s2">really sort of valid comments criticisms</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.820" end="00:00:42.890" style="s2">and ultimately like so we put out a</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.040" end="00:00:45.960" style="s2">video and I wrote a really long novel on</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.890" end="00:00:46.320" style="s2">medium which will link to under this as</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.960" end="00:00:48.570" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.320" end="00:00:51.870" style="s2">and what was interesting is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.570" end="00:00:53.670" style="s2">developing as Peterson says I write to</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.870" end="00:00:55.500" style="s2">know what I think and I really felt like</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.670" end="00:00:57.270" style="s2">by writing it I was sort of getting to</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.500" end="00:00:59.370" style="s2">know more of what actually thought about</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.270" end="00:01:01.020" style="s2">it and then reading people&#39;s responses</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.370" end="00:01:03.090" style="s2">helping that kind of conversation as</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.020" end="00:01:04.680" style="s2">well so there&#39;s this these two images to</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.090" end="00:01:06.540" style="s2">Peter someone on that on one side is</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.680" end="00:01:08.939" style="s2">like Peterson&#39;s a cult and it&#39;s his</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.540" end="00:01:11.100" style="s2">followers are just kind of idle</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.939" end="00:01:13.409" style="s2">worshiping and it&#39;s and the other side</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.100" end="00:01:14.790" style="s2">of which I think more true that</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.409" end="00:01:18.060" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s actually become a filter for</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.790" end="00:01:20.640" style="s2">three thinkers because you have to you</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.060" end="00:01:22.170" style="s2">have to have some sense of I&#39;m not going</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.640" end="00:01:24.930" style="s2">to listen to what they think I should</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.170" end="00:01:27.119" style="s2">think about this guy to be interested in</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.930" end="00:01:29.040" style="s2">it you have to go through the pain of</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.119" end="00:01:31.140" style="s2">kind of my friends might judge me</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.040" end="00:01:33.540" style="s2">because I&#39;m into this guy and come out</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.140" end="00:01:35.250" style="s2">the other side and what was amazing in</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.540" end="00:01:36.869" style="s2">the responses in the comments was it</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.250" end="00:01:38.060" style="s2">really felt like he is this filter for</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.869" end="00:01:40.680" style="s2">freethinkers</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.060" end="00:01:42.899" style="s2">the the vast majority of them were</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.680" end="00:01:45.240" style="s2">offering constructive criticism all of</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.899" end="00:01:47.759" style="s2">us and constructive criticism of him and</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.240" end="00:01:50.369" style="s2">it felt like a very healthy conversation</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.759" end="00:01:53.880" style="s2">yeah yeah and I think I shared that kind</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.369" end="00:01:56.340" style="s2">of nervousness maybe from me from from a</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.880" end="00:01:58.710" style="s2">different angle which was the you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.340" end="00:02:02.700" style="s2">Peterson has had so much ad hominem</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.710" end="00:02:04.619" style="s2">attack from the media and also just</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.700" end="00:02:08.420" style="s2">outright lies as well there&#39;s been a lot</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.619" end="00:02:11.099" style="s2">of that so there&#39;s a nuance to critique</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.420" end="00:02:14.310" style="s2">tactics which i think was was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.099" end="00:02:16.980" style="s2">the bulk of our podcast critiquing an</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.310" end="00:02:19.709" style="s2">individual which is really what the the</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.980" end="00:02:21.299" style="s2">media has done and which for me has no</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.709" end="00:02:23.640" style="s2">place in rebel wisdom is its you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.299" end="00:02:25.620" style="s2">the third thing is critiquing ideas you</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.640" end="00:02:28.049" style="s2">know and those things you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.620" end="00:02:29.609" style="s2">critiquing tactics in particular I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.049" end="00:02:31.079" style="s2">is a really important thing but also</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.609" end="00:02:33.359" style="s2">critiquing the delivery of those ideas</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.079" end="00:02:35.670" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s a good point</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.359" end="00:02:37.829" style="s2">yeah which which for me links into</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.670" end="00:02:39.510" style="s2">tactics as well I think that what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.829" end="00:02:42.840" style="s2">doing is offering it in the spirit of</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.510" end="00:02:44.489" style="s2">Peterson himself what is not required is</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.840" end="00:02:48.209" style="s2">unconditional positive regard what is</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.489" end="00:02:50.730" style="s2">required is genuinely wanting success</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.209" end="00:02:54.090" style="s2">and wanting the best of him and the best</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.730" end="00:02:55.530" style="s2">of this to succeed and I hope that we</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.090" end="00:02:57.419" style="s2">are coming from that place I mean only</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.530" end="00:02:59.400" style="s2">other I mean people would do make their</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.419" end="00:03:01.769" style="s2">own judgments but I genuinely believe</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.400" end="00:03:02.909" style="s2">I&#39;ve wrestled with this stuff we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.769" end="00:03:06.329" style="s2">wrestled with this stuff and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.909" end="00:03:08.400" style="s2">trying to come from that place and so I</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.329" end="00:03:09.329" style="s2">just yeah it&#39;s one a recap just in case</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.400" end="00:03:11.040" style="s2">people are watching this without having</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.329" end="00:03:14.879" style="s2">watched the first podcast we basically</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.040" end="00:03:16.049" style="s2">said three things that the message could</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.879" end="00:03:17.250" style="s2">be framed in a way that would reach</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.049" end="00:03:23.400" style="s2">people that are resistant to at the</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.250" end="00:03:25.139" style="s2">moment that they&#39;re maybe he could look</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.400" end="00:03:27.959" style="s2">at retreating from some of the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.139" end="00:03:30.419" style="s2">daily combat the media firefighting</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.959" end="00:03:31.709" style="s2">stuff kind of he&#39;s off he&#39;s talked</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.419" end="00:03:33.930" style="s2">before about you shouldn&#39;t put pearls</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.709" end="00:03:38.549" style="s2">before swine and maybe it&#39;s getting to</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.930" end="00:03:42.389" style="s2">that stage and also that I am not seeing</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.549" end="00:03:44.220" style="s2">the same JP as I did a while ago and it</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.389" end="00:03:46.440" style="s2">would be almost impossible for him to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.220" end="00:03:48.750" style="s2">the same because of the unfair attacks</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.440" end="00:03:52.109" style="s2">that he&#39;s had but why the Kathy Newman</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.750" end="00:03:55.019" style="s2">interview worked was that he it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.109" end="00:03:57.090" style="s2">just he had the facts and he out did her</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.019" end="00:04:00.389" style="s2">on that level there was a humor and a</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.090" end="00:04:02.540" style="s2">wit and a performance to that that won</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.389" end="00:04:05.970" style="s2">people over and I actually messaged him</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.540" end="00:04:08.900" style="s2">after that he was still he wasn&#39;t famous</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.970" end="00:04:12.180" style="s2">he is now so culprit ply at that point</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.900" end="00:04:14.250" style="s2">just to say wow fantastically well done</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.180" end="00:04:16.380" style="s2">on that interview I know that that will</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.250" end="00:04:20.280" style="s2">reach people who were resistant already</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.380" end="00:04:21.750" style="s2">and I don&#39;t see so much of that</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.280" end="00:04:23.990" style="s2">anymore so that was kind of the other</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.750" end="00:04:27.540" style="s2">part of it yeah and just at that point</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.990" end="00:04:28.770" style="s2">after the Kathy Newman interview he</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.540" end="00:04:31.650" style="s2">mentioned you know he talked about</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.770" end="00:04:33.870" style="s2">animus possession and he talked about if</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.650" end="00:04:35.550" style="s2">you engage in the argument with you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.870" end="00:04:37.400" style="s2">with the energy Kathy Newman was coming</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.550" end="00:04:40.680" style="s2">from you&#39;ve already lost the argument</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.400" end="00:04:42.450" style="s2">and in a sense I think the more he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.680" end="00:04:44.340" style="s2">delved into the mainstream media and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.450" end="00:04:47.160" style="s2">more they&#39;ve started to kind of direct</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.340" end="00:04:48.450" style="s2">the conversation the more and more it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.160" end="00:04:50.880" style="s2">been more difficult not to engage in</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.450" end="00:04:52.590" style="s2">that argument you know so I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.880" end="00:04:54.540" style="s2">that&#39;s part of the kind of expanding out</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.590" end="00:04:56.010" style="s2">of the reason for those tactics being</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.540" end="00:04:57.870" style="s2">important I think yeah and one more</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.010" end="00:05:00.030" style="s2">point that actually came out in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.870" end="00:05:03.350" style="s2">writing of the article and in some of</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.030" end="00:05:07.169" style="s2">the feedback is is there a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.350" end="00:05:09.180" style="s2">theological point or resolution than</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.169" end="00:05:11.669" style="s2">what Peterson&#39;s putting out there and</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.180" end="00:05:14.100" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna unpack and explore that with</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.669" end="00:05:17.490" style="s2">Louise Mazzanti who appeared in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.100" end="00:05:19.950" style="s2">glitch in the matrix film hello so we</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.490" end="00:05:21.540" style="s2">thought it would be interesting to kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.950" end="00:05:23.520" style="s2">of delve into the comment and then pick</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.540" end="00:05:26.070" style="s2">out different critiques or ideas or</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.520" end="00:05:29.610" style="s2">things people were adding so the first</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.070" end="00:05:32.190" style="s2">one wanted to talk about is in a couple</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.610" end="00:05:34.229" style="s2">of the comments this idea of what I call</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.190" end="00:05:37.380" style="s2">like the Fairweather friends argument of</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.229" end="00:05:39.720" style="s2">you know this is this isn&#39;t the time to</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.380" end="00:05:41.729" style="s2">be criticizing Peterson you know he</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.720" end="00:05:42.930" style="s2">needs support right now you know you</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.729" end="00:05:47.040" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be doing that so so what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.930" end="00:05:48.630" style="s2">your take on that I think this goes to</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.040" end="00:05:52.500" style="s2">the heart of what we were saying really</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.630" end="00:05:56.240" style="s2">the idea that polarization encourages</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.500" end="00:05:58.860" style="s2">this son of a some men mentality and</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.240" end="00:06:00.180" style="s2">ultimately I think what Peterson is is</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.860" end="00:06:01.800" style="s2">saying is trying to get us the other</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.180" end="00:06:03.919" style="s2">side of this and this is something I</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.800" end="00:06:06.510" style="s2">reckon Brett Weinstein talked about in</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.919" end="00:06:08.430" style="s2">the Dave Rubin podcast which is</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.510" end="00:06:08.880" style="s2">incredible if anyone&#39;s not seeing it go</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.430" end="00:06:12.270" style="s2">and watch it</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.880" end="00:06:15.780" style="s2">amazing amazing podcast they said that</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.270" end="00:06:17.490" style="s2">in the past speaking out against being</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.780" end="00:06:19.560" style="s2">ejected from your tribe would have been</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.490" end="00:06:23.460" style="s2">a fatal thing throughout most of human</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.560" end="00:06:26.030" style="s2">history so we we have this as a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.460" end="00:06:29.099" style="s2">internalized biological reality that</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.030" end="00:06:33.520" style="s2">this kind of feminist is tribalism which</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.099" end="00:06:35.050" style="s2">I would argue is why with</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.520" end="00:06:37.599" style="s2">like me to wipe ourselves out if we</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.050" end="00:06:39.400" style="s2">don&#39;t evolve to the past this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.599" end="00:06:41.050" style="s2">reactivity is social media makes it</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.400" end="00:06:42.520" style="s2">worse everything makes it worse and at</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.050" end="00:06:45.069" style="s2">the moment this kind of polarization or</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.520" end="00:06:49.539" style="s2">this kind of dynamic is is seem to be at</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.069" end="00:06:51.490" style="s2">its peak and Pedersen is the one man</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.539" end="00:06:53.740" style="s2">kind of lightning rod for this new</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.490" end="00:06:55.710" style="s2">culture wars I think to add to that as</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.740" end="00:06:57.849" style="s2">well that there&#39;s there&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.710" end="00:06:59.770" style="s2">concept of you know a tribe of</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.849" end="00:07:02.590" style="s2">individuals very different from from a</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.770" end="00:07:04.569" style="s2">different kind of tribe and I think a</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.590" end="00:07:07.810" style="s2">big part of Peterson&#39;s message is in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.569" end="00:07:09.940" style="s2">primacy of the individual of your own</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.810" end="00:07:12.460" style="s2">experience and your own truth I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.940" end="00:07:13.990" style="s2">speaking the truth certainly if I was</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.460" end="00:07:17.830" style="s2">going to pick a side I know its side I</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.990" end="00:07:19.599" style="s2">pick but I&#39;m trying to kind of see that</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.830" end="00:07:21.270" style="s2">is there a chance that we can get past</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.599" end="00:07:24.520" style="s2">this whole game of picking sides</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.270" end="00:07:26.560" style="s2">we might be naive we might be wrong and</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.520" end="00:07:29.130" style="s2">I certainly felt in myself as we put the</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.560" end="00:07:33.430" style="s2">stuff out there this sort of sense of</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.130" end="00:07:36.520" style="s2">nervousness and sense of kind of is this</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.430" end="00:07:38.889" style="s2">right am i betraying something fighting</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.520" end="00:07:40.870" style="s2">with this other sense of no this is my</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.889" end="00:07:43.360" style="s2">truth this is what I have to add to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.870" end="00:07:44.860" style="s2">conversation and I have to and I have to</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.360" end="00:07:47.110" style="s2">add this like Peterson talks about it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.860" end="00:07:49.270" style="s2">like things go corrupt when people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.110" end="00:07:50.919" style="s2">speak their truth and I might be wrong I</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.270" end="00:07:51.819" style="s2">mean this is an ongoing conversation</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.919" end="00:07:53.710" style="s2">it&#39;s ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.819" end="00:07:55.330" style="s2">I mean that&#39;s another thing that he says</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.710" end="00:08:00.219" style="s2">it&#39;s like what the do you know I</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.330" end="00:08:02.020" style="s2">mean you&#39;re an idiot you know you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.219" end="00:08:03.190" style="s2">know enough by definition I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.020" end="00:08:06.330" style="s2">enough by definition we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.190" end="00:08:09.400" style="s2">enough by definition we&#39;re all kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.330" end="00:08:11.469" style="s2">groping towards the truth as best we can</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.400" end="00:08:14.889" style="s2">and this is what we&#39;re trying to do and</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.469" end="00:08:17.110" style="s2">I believe that we&#39;re also like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.889" end="00:08:19.180" style="s2">teaching men&#39;s work as well and this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.110" end="00:08:20.949" style="s2">a core part of what we&#39;re teaching like</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.180" end="00:08:24.279" style="s2">speaking your truth giving your</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.949" end="00:08:26.650" style="s2">brother&#39;s honest reflections and being</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.279" end="00:08:28.960" style="s2">really reflective of what is coming up</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.650" end="00:08:32.229" style="s2">in myself at the same time whether I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.960" end="00:08:34.329" style="s2">just projecting my own kind of sense of</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.229" end="00:08:36.669" style="s2">superiority or whatever out onto the</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.329" end="00:08:38.349" style="s2">world and try it we&#39;re in the process of</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.669" end="00:08:40.510" style="s2">trying to do that at the same time and I</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.349" end="00:08:42.579" style="s2">think the key word is it&#39;s a process it</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.510" end="00:08:44.649" style="s2">is a process of like you&#39;ve said you</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.579" end="00:08:45.490" style="s2">know you speak to know you speak to</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.649" end="00:08:47.110" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.490" end="00:08:50.440" style="s2">and it&#39;s a process in the men&#39;s work as</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.110" end="00:08:52.990" style="s2">well of especially that people often</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.440" end="00:08:55.000" style="s2">find it difficult to reflect to to you</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.990" end="00:08:56.320" style="s2">know another guy in the group of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.000" end="00:08:58.420" style="s2">things of hey hip man here&#39;s where I see</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.320" end="00:09:00.490" style="s2">your blind spots and you know in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.420" end="00:09:01.720" style="s2">groups we go around and we&#39;ll kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.490" end="00:09:04.060" style="s2">listen in and the circles and be like</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.720" end="00:09:06.550" style="s2">and if someone is kind of falling in to</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.060" end="00:09:07.510" style="s2">pleasing of like oh yeah you can</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.550" end="00:09:08.980" style="s2">sometimes be a little bit mean but</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.510" end="00:09:10.990" style="s2">you&#39;re really great otherwise you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.980" end="00:09:12.580" style="s2">it&#39;s like you you know one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.990" end="00:09:14.560" style="s2">office say is you&#39;re not serving you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.580" end="00:09:18.010" style="s2">not helping him you&#39;re not helping him</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.560" end="00:09:19.120" style="s2">by pleasing the help will be reflection</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.010" end="00:09:21.610" style="s2">because we cannot see our own blind</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.120" end="00:09:24.070" style="s2">spots by definition so that&#39;s why the</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.610" end="00:09:27.430" style="s2">college that yeah so to move on to</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.070" end="00:09:29.080" style="s2">another question a kind of a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.430" end="00:09:31.090" style="s2">comments around the theme of you guys</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.080" end="00:09:33.280" style="s2">have lost your nerve have you lost your</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.090" end="00:09:34.810" style="s2">nerve David it would have been much</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.280" end="00:09:36.310" style="s2">easier for us to carry on and we are</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.810" end="00:09:40.330" style="s2">going to carry on doing sort of Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.310" end="00:09:42.160" style="s2">themed interviews and work because I</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.330" end="00:09:45.310" style="s2">think the the perspective that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.160" end="00:09:47.740" style="s2">bringing is the most complete thing I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.310" end="00:09:49.360" style="s2">ever seen and so we are going to use it</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.740" end="00:09:51.900" style="s2">as a window into other thinkers and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.360" end="00:09:55.450" style="s2">window into in terms of broadening</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.900" end="00:09:57.730" style="s2">broadening out as much as we can and it</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.450" end="00:10:00.040" style="s2">it would have been much easier not to do</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.730" end="00:10:00.640" style="s2">this so have we lost our nerve I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.040" end="00:10:03.160" style="s2">think so</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.640" end="00:10:04.840" style="s2">one or two comments around yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.160" end="00:10:06.430" style="s2">piggybacked you know with piggybacked on</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.840" end="00:10:08.980" style="s2">Peterson and then now we&#39;re stabbing him</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.430" end="00:10:12.490" style="s2">in the back by critiquing him what are</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.980" end="00:10:14.080" style="s2">your thoughts on that and also there was</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.490" end="00:10:19.800" style="s2">one guy who said and that&#39;s not what men</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.080" end="00:10:23.380" style="s2">do men back each other up it&#39;s like I</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.800" end="00:10:24.820" style="s2">have I was genuinely concerned that he</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.380" end="00:10:25.960" style="s2">might think that as well like I actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.820" end="00:10:30.700" style="s2">sent him a message</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.960" end="00:10:34.390" style="s2">about that a while ago saying look I I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.700" end="00:10:35.860" style="s2">really trying to act ethically we the</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.390" end="00:10:38.560" style="s2">interview gave us really did give us a</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.860" end="00:10:42.310" style="s2">boost and allow us to kind of attract</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.560" end="00:10:43.510" style="s2">attention with rebel wisdom and you are</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.310" end="00:10:45.790" style="s2">he also uploaded the glitch in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.510" end="00:10:48.580" style="s2">matrix to his channel which gave us</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.790" end="00:10:51.339" style="s2">another boost as well and I&#39;m eternally</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.580" end="00:10:53.350" style="s2">grateful for that all I can do is</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.339" end="00:10:55.000" style="s2">explain where I&#39;m coming from and how</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.350" end="00:10:56.110" style="s2">it&#39;s got to this point and people can</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.000" end="00:10:56.810" style="s2">make their own judgments as to whether</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.110" end="00:11:01.180" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.810" end="00:11:04.130" style="s2">piggybacking on his success or not I</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.180" end="00:11:06.370" style="s2">used to be a journalist well I am that I</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.130" end="00:11:08.840" style="s2">am a journalist documentary maker</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.370" end="00:11:14.089" style="s2">reporter I work for channel 4 news for</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.840" end="00:11:17.120" style="s2">many years I made documentaries I found</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.089" end="00:11:19.220" style="s2">Peterson July no June of last year and I</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.120" end="00:11:21.350" style="s2">immediately became hooked and I wrote</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.220" end="00:11:23.210" style="s2">the medium article truth in the time of</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.350" end="00:11:25.910" style="s2">chaos one of the first medium articles I</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.210" end="00:11:29.420" style="s2">think about him where I transcribed a</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.910" end="00:11:32.660" style="s2">load of his stuff and put up no 3,000</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.420" end="00:11:35.120" style="s2">words something like that and it was</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.660" end="00:11:37.070" style="s2">because of that that I then got the</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.120" end="00:11:38.300" style="s2">interview with him when I was going to</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.070" end="00:11:40.010" style="s2">the leaf of going over to one of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.300" end="00:11:41.510" style="s2">Bible lectures and then thought well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.010" end="00:11:44.360" style="s2">a journalist I might save and get</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.510" end="00:11:46.190" style="s2">interview with him sent him that the</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.360" end="00:11:48.800" style="s2">article and he really liked it said he</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.190" end="00:11:50.839" style="s2">done it&#39;s a very careful job and he was</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.800" end="00:11:54.650" style="s2">happy to do an interview which I&#39;m again</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.839" end="00:11:56.600" style="s2">very grateful for and then after doing</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.650" end="00:11:58.130" style="s2">the interview I then thought well from</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.600" end="00:11:59.750" style="s2">the beginning I&#39;ve been thinking there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.130" end="00:12:01.610" style="s2">a lot of people who are just not seeing</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.750" end="00:12:02.960" style="s2">this message they&#39;re getting hung up on</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.610" end="00:12:04.910" style="s2">the political stuff they&#39;re not seeing</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.960" end="00:12:06.350" style="s2">what he&#39;s actually about and so I</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.910" end="00:12:08.060" style="s2">thought okay I&#39;m gonna make a</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.350" end="00:12:10.190" style="s2">documentary and so I made truth in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.060" end="00:12:12.140" style="s2">time of chaos to try and provide that</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.190" end="00:12:13.790" style="s2">kind of context to explain what he was</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.140" end="00:12:15.890" style="s2">really about like the theological stuff</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.790" end="00:12:18.410" style="s2">in the interview I did with him we</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.890" end="00:12:21.320" style="s2">didn&#39;t talk about the trans stuff or the</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.410" end="00:12:23.690" style="s2">pollak politic stuff at all the least</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.320" end="00:12:26.030" style="s2">interesting thing about him in my view</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.690" end="00:12:28.100" style="s2">is the politic stuff the most</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.030" end="00:12:29.990" style="s2">interesting thing is the deep the deep</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.100" end="00:12:32.240" style="s2">mythological the deep archetype or the</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.990" end="00:12:34.100" style="s2">de Young in integration which he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.240" end="00:12:35.450" style="s2">bringing forward and so a lot of what we</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.100" end="00:12:37.370" style="s2">talked about was about synchronicity and</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.450" end="00:12:40.790" style="s2">about young and it was about this kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.370" end="00:12:43.430" style="s2">of deeper message and so I put that</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.790" end="00:12:45.400" style="s2">article that documentary out and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.430" end="00:12:48.440" style="s2">the Kathy Newman interview happened and</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.400" end="00:12:50.150" style="s2">I was kind of trying to leave behind the</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.440" end="00:12:52.730" style="s2">scenes between him and Kathy for a while</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.150" end="00:12:54.620" style="s2">and because that&#39;s what I thought it was</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.730" end="00:12:56.029" style="s2">amazing synchronicity we we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.620" end="00:12:58.240" style="s2">synchronicity that was basically the</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.029" end="00:13:00.470" style="s2">topic of our conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.240" end="00:13:01.850" style="s2">synchronicity being like amazing</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.470" end="00:13:03.740" style="s2">coincidences that tell you something</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.850" end="00:13:04.529" style="s2">meaningful like there&#39;s some there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.740" end="00:13:07.259" style="s2">some how mentor</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.529" end="00:13:08.459" style="s2">and then he comes to the UK I&#39;m the only</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.259" end="00:13:12.569" style="s2">person who&#39;s done a documentary about</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.459" end="00:13:15.179" style="s2">him he then leads to fame on the show I</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.569" end="00:13:17.819" style="s2">used to work on with Kathy Newman who is</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.179" end="00:13:19.199" style="s2">an ex colleague of mine and I I message</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.819" end="00:13:21.629" style="s2">them both immediately after the</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.199" end="00:13:24.479" style="s2">interview independently to say to</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.629" end="00:13:26.879" style="s2">Peterson as I just said well that well</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.479" end="00:13:28.319" style="s2">done that was amazing I think the humor</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.879" end="00:13:31.229" style="s2">and the wit that&#39;s probably one people</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.319" end="00:13:34.649" style="s2">over and to Kathy to say I really liked</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.229" end="00:13:36.089" style="s2">that the way that you you guys warm to</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.649" end="00:13:37.859" style="s2">each other by the end because there was</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.089" end="00:13:42.239" style="s2">a kind of genuine kind of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.859" end="00:13:46.019" style="s2">respect by the end and they both</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.239" end="00:13:48.599" style="s2">responded and and then this whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.019" end="00:13:50.369" style="s2">blew up and I really felt I was like wow</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.599" end="00:13:51.929" style="s2">this is an amazing position and I really</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.369" end="00:13:52.919" style="s2">wanted to kind of Liege between them for</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.929" end="00:13:55.229" style="s2">a while that&#39;s what I thought I was</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.919" end="00:13:56.399" style="s2">meant to do it&#39;s like what&#39;s the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.229" end="00:13:58.919" style="s2">of the synchronicity where you&#39;re meant</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.399" end="00:14:02.759" style="s2">to kind of try and help them renegotiate</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.919" end="00:14:05.399" style="s2">because on one side Peterson was very</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.759" end="00:14:09.029" style="s2">upset on one side I know for sure that</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.399" end="00:14:11.069" style="s2">they were it wasn&#39;t spin like Kathy did</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.029" end="00:14:14.939" style="s2">feel under attack Channel 4 News did</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.069" end="00:14:17.849" style="s2">feel under attack it wasn&#39;t spin I do</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.939" end="00:14:19.889" style="s2">have my doubts about that then calling</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.849" end="00:14:21.839" style="s2">in security experts or or the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.889" end="00:14:23.039" style="s2">they put that out I think I mean they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.839" end="00:14:24.809" style="s2">journalists they know how to may know</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.039" end="00:14:26.429" style="s2">how to control the narrative I do have</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.809" end="00:14:27.839" style="s2">my suspicions around them doing that</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.429" end="00:14:30.329" style="s2">which I didn&#39;t at the time but I</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.839" end="00:14:33.359" style="s2">developed them afterwards but Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.329" end="00:14:35.309" style="s2">was very angry about the fact that it</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.359" end="00:14:36.449" style="s2">was now being spun as Kathy was a victim</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.309" end="00:14:38.099" style="s2">and all their stuff and I completely</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.449" end="00:14:41.519" style="s2">understood his perspective as well and I</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.099" end="00:14:43.019" style="s2">agree with it but I also knew that from</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.519" end="00:14:44.339" style="s2">inside channel 4 news that&#39;s not what</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.019" end="00:14:46.470" style="s2">they were thinking they were genuinely</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.339" end="00:14:47.819" style="s2">were upset at the comments that Kathy</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.470" end="00:14:48.659" style="s2">was getting and I know that privately</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.819" end="00:14:51.419" style="s2">they were getting some really horrific</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.659" end="00:14:53.279" style="s2">stuff so it wasn&#39;t I could see both</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.419" end="00:14:56.879" style="s2">sides and I was trying kind of the ACE</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.279" end="00:14:58.799" style="s2">and Peterson was interested in in having</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.879" end="00:14:59.189" style="s2">a second interview and wanted to do to</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.799" end="00:15:01.159" style="s2">do it</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.189" end="00:15:04.109" style="s2">Channel 4 News just wanted it to go away</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.159" end="00:15:05.509" style="s2">so eventually I was like a case of what</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.109" end="00:15:08.219" style="s2">am I meant to do with this I and I</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.509" end="00:15:10.289" style="s2">realized okay I&#39;ll put out glitch in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.219" end="00:15:11.699" style="s2">matrix or just all of these ideas that</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.289" end="00:15:12.929" style="s2">have been sort of bubbling away about</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.699" end="00:15:14.000" style="s2">since the Trump election I then</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.929" end="00:15:15.980" style="s2">downloaded in</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.000" end="00:15:19.880" style="s2">you glitching the matrix put it together</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.980" end="00:15:21.830" style="s2">in about two weeks and I was in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.880" end="00:15:24.590" style="s2">Channel 4 News newsroom two weeks before</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.830" end="00:15:27.080" style="s2">I put that documentary out freelancing</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.590" end="00:15:28.850" style="s2">there my freelance there since I left I</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.080" end="00:15:29.720" style="s2">knew I would not be able to go back into</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.850" end="00:15:32.840" style="s2">that newsroom when I put that</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.720" end="00:15:34.760" style="s2">documentary out just they were critic</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.840" end="00:15:37.820" style="s2">criticisms of Channel 4 News in there I</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.760" end="00:15:40.070" style="s2">was pretty much weighing into the debate</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.820" end="00:15:41.770" style="s2">around Kathy Newman where they just</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.070" end="00:15:43.640" style="s2">wanted to protect her at that time</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.770" end="00:15:44.990" style="s2">understandably because some of the some</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.640" end="00:15:46.640" style="s2">of the abuse she was getting was really</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.990" end="00:15:49.190" style="s2">serious and I knew it makes things</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.640" end="00:15:52.730" style="s2">incredibly difficult so but I made that</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.190" end="00:15:54.500" style="s2">decision at that point that I would that</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.730" end="00:15:58.460" style="s2">that wasn&#39;t my path anymore that</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.500" end="00:16:00.470" style="s2">actually this creating rebel wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.460" end="00:16:01.820" style="s2">outside the mainstream media has been</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.470" end="00:16:04.190" style="s2">the thing that I&#39;ve decided to do so I</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.820" end="00:16:05.450" style="s2">was kind of I was accepting the</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.190" end="00:16:10.610" style="s2">possibility that I was ending my career</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.450" end="00:16:12.530" style="s2">in news and current affairs by doing</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.610" end="00:16:17.030" style="s2">putting that out I was being disloyal to</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.530" end="00:16:20.360" style="s2">them so people can judge as to whether</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.030" end="00:16:21.589" style="s2">that&#39;s a sacrifice or not and I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.360" end="00:16:25.790" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s probably made bigger</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.589" end="00:16:29.150" style="s2">sacrifices but I think I have taken</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.790" end="00:16:31.550" style="s2">decisions that I think I do have skin in</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.150" end="00:16:34.280" style="s2">this game so what you&#39;re saying is we</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.550" end="00:16:36.830" style="s2">live in the matrix what I&#39;m saying is</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.280" end="00:16:38.810" style="s2">yes watch glitch in the matrix another</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.830" end="00:16:42.290" style="s2">interesting question is is you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.810" end="00:16:44.810" style="s2">people were asking well are we saying</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.290" end="00:16:46.760" style="s2">that Peterson should censor himself or</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.810" end="00:16:49.790" style="s2">should he you know should he change his</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.760" end="00:16:51.890" style="s2">tone what do you thoughts on that I</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.790" end="00:16:53.630" style="s2">don&#39;t think he should stop speaking the</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.890" end="00:16:58.400" style="s2">truth I think he should just do it</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.630" end="00:16:59.960" style="s2">smarter I think that and this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.400" end="00:17:01.820" style="s2">something that Andrew Sweeney who wrote</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.960" end="00:17:04.459" style="s2">a blog post alongside it talked about</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.820" end="00:17:06.620" style="s2">that this idea of the castration cult</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.459" end="00:17:07.699" style="s2">the sort of great mother and what was</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.620" end="00:17:09.560" style="s2">seeing if you&#39;d kind of look at it from</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.699" end="00:17:12.439" style="s2">the archetypal perspective the media is</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.560" end="00:17:13.939" style="s2">acting like a castration cult Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.439" end="00:17:15.319" style="s2">needs to behave and he&#39;s to stop being</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.939" end="00:17:18.680" style="s2">angry he needs to do this it&#39;s like this</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.319" end="00:17:22.069" style="s2">kind of lecturing finger wagging kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.680" end="00:17:25.520" style="s2">anti masculine tone to a lot of a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.069" end="00:17:26.850" style="s2">it which and we&#39;re not saying Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.520" end="00:17:29.850" style="s2">needs to behave and buts</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.850" end="00:17:31.860" style="s2">what I am saying is that I think he</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.850" end="00:17:38.520" style="s2">could frame it in a way that would that</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.860" end="00:17:41.460" style="s2">would reach more people and that I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.520" end="00:17:43.049" style="s2">he is because at first I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.460" end="00:17:45.299" style="s2">well he&#39;s just speaking the truth and</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.049" end="00:17:48.419" style="s2">just allowing it to fall as it will it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.299" end="00:17:50.100" style="s2">fine if the media misrepresents him he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.419" end="00:17:52.740" style="s2">not playing the media game which I had</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.100" end="00:17:54.120" style="s2">some sympathy for but I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.740" end="00:17:57.270" style="s2">that&#39;s true I think he is playing the</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.120" end="00:18:02.520" style="s2">media game in some ways like think about</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.270" end="00:18:04.230" style="s2">Milo he&#39;s never been on Milo&#39;s show I I</p>

<p begin="00:18:33.419" end="00:18:36.900" style="s2">was playing with fire and the danger</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.700" end="00:18:38.580" style="s2">with petersen like mine I was still</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.900" end="00:18:41.220" style="s2">doing okay got his own podcast he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.580" end="00:18:43.049" style="s2">probably never going to want four people</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.220" end="00:18:46.049" style="s2">to provide him money he still got a</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.049" end="00:18:47.250" style="s2">fanbase but he is at in terms of his</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.049" end="00:18:49.140" style="s2">influence on the national conversation</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.250" end="00:18:55.490" style="s2">or the international conversation it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.140" end="00:18:58.370" style="s2">zero he is now he has been defined and</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.490" end="00:19:00.510" style="s2">discarded by the national conversation</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.370" end="00:19:03.299" style="s2">Peterson is too important for that to</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.510" end="00:19:04.740" style="s2">happen to and I think he is a different</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.299" end="00:19:07.919" style="s2">character than Milo and I think he has</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.740" end="00:19:10.230" style="s2">different motivations with Milo as it</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.919" end="00:19:11.700" style="s2">was a case of this was kind of bound to</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.230" end="00:19:13.830" style="s2">happen he was a shooting star that was</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.700" end="00:19:15.900" style="s2">bound to flame out I&#39;m not convinced</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.830" end="00:19:17.669" style="s2">that the Peterson is bound to flame out</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.900" end="00:19:18.840" style="s2">or should flame out I think he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.669" end="00:19:20.039" style="s2">bringing something that&#39;s still gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.840" end="00:19:23.010" style="s2">relevant to the like two hundred years</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.039" end="00:19:25.080" style="s2">time whereas I don&#39;t think Milo is and</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.010" end="00:19:27.929" style="s2">one of the reasons they dropped his book</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.080" end="00:19:31.440" style="s2">is it was complete if you read the</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.929" end="00:19:32.700" style="s2">reports he&#39;s he was saying he was made a</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.440" end="00:19:38.190" style="s2">career up saying things that no one else</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.700" end="00:19:40.150" style="s2">would say but apart from that he he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.190" end="00:19:41.559" style="s2">not it&#39;s not an intellect</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.150" end="00:19:43.000" style="s2">it&#39;s not on the same level of someone</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.559" end="00:19:45.940" style="s2">like Peterson yeah that brings me to</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.000" end="00:19:49.150" style="s2">another point that kind of came up in</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.940" end="00:19:52.210" style="s2">the comments as well which is slightly</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.150" end="00:19:54.159" style="s2">link to it this idea of you know you</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.210" end="00:19:56.080" style="s2">well you can&#39;t talk to the radical left</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.159" end="00:19:57.730" style="s2">there&#39;s no talking to them there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.080" end="00:20:00.370" style="s2">point in trying to win them over you</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.730" end="00:20:02.799" style="s2">know etc the way I see the link to that</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.370" end="00:20:07.000" style="s2">is that the media the mainstream media</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.799" end="00:20:10.600" style="s2">is kind of the act a big access point to</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.000" end="00:20:13.480" style="s2">the kind of really radical sjw&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.600" end="00:20:15.010" style="s2">thinking on that is that I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.480" end="00:20:18.279" style="s2">truth in that I think the most radical</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.010" end="00:20:20.529" style="s2">extreme they&#39;re not reachable by</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.279" end="00:20:22.360" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s message there you know but I</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.529" end="00:20:26.340" style="s2">don&#39;t think they&#39;re the majority by any</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.360" end="00:20:28.690" style="s2">means in fact the the audience that</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.340" end="00:20:32.740" style="s2">dimension media allows you to talk to is</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.690" end="00:20:34.929" style="s2">the massive group of fairly reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.740" end="00:20:37.029" style="s2">open-minded people on the Left who</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.929" end="00:20:39.779" style="s2">really could use Peterson&#39;s message who</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.029" end="00:20:43.510" style="s2">need to be read pilled effectively and</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.779" end="00:20:45.730" style="s2">that that makes it matter the tactics</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.510" end="00:20:48.970" style="s2">you use to reach them because they are</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.730" end="00:20:50.500" style="s2">they are being kind of shamed into</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.970" end="00:20:51.970" style="s2">having a certain worldview which is</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.500" end="00:20:54.700" style="s2">based around shame that kind of social</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.970" end="00:20:56.770" style="s2">justice worldview and that&#39;s a strong</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.700" end="00:20:58.179" style="s2">pull on them of like you&#39;re not allowed</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.770" end="00:21:00.070" style="s2">to listen to this person because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.179" end="00:21:03.010" style="s2">they have a deep concern with how you</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.070" end="00:21:06.460" style="s2">think what you believe and they can take</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.010" end="00:21:08.080" style="s2">things like hit pieces and make it a</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.460" end="00:21:11.070" style="s2">very effective tool to keep people there</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.080" end="00:21:14.730" style="s2">so yeah there&#39;s two things here one</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.070" end="00:21:17.230" style="s2">Peterson says that sanity is out sourced</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.730" end="00:21:19.630" style="s2">like sanity is such a complicated</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.230" end="00:21:24.370" style="s2">problem that we outsource it to other</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.630" end="00:21:25.720" style="s2">people in some ways we we we moderate</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.370" end="00:21:28.210" style="s2">our behavior by the reaction that we</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.720" end="00:21:32.529" style="s2">have from other people so sense making</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.210" end="00:21:34.059" style="s2">is also out sourced we we we all to some</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.529" end="00:21:36.340" style="s2">degree either we make up our own minds</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.059" end="00:21:38.740" style="s2">or we follow others but we can&#39;t make up</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.340" end="00:21:41.409" style="s2">our own minds all the time like we all</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.740" end="00:21:43.539" style="s2">have these we take cues from what other</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.409" end="00:21:45.010" style="s2">people like or from from people that we</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.539" end="00:21:46.539" style="s2">see on Twitter it&#39;s impossible to make</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.010" end="00:21:47.740" style="s2">up our own minds entirely about every</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.539" end="00:21:49.690" style="s2">single thing all the time we&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.740" end="00:21:51.900" style="s2">influenced by what other people are</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.690" end="00:21:55.020" style="s2">thinking and and some kind of peer</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.900" end="00:21:58.470" style="s2">not peer pressure but but peer like our</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.020" end="00:22:01.080" style="s2">anchor points so and my worry is that</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.470" end="00:22:02.910" style="s2">Peterson has lost a lot of key anchor</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.080" end="00:22:05.880" style="s2">points who are not interested in sort of</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.910" end="00:22:08.880" style="s2">delving in deeper into his message I on</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.880" end="00:22:11.100" style="s2">my Twitter feed I try and have a balance</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.880" end="00:22:12.770" style="s2">I try and balance it with different</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.100" end="00:22:15.210" style="s2">perspectives and I see a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.770" end="00:22:17.520" style="s2">reasonable intelligent left-leaning</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.210" end="00:22:21.990" style="s2">journalists who I consider open-minded</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.520" end="00:22:23.610" style="s2">and reachable sharing sort of Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.990" end="00:22:24.870" style="s2">hit pieces and saying well I always knew</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.610" end="00:22:27.870" style="s2">there was something about this guy and</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.870" end="00:22:30.030" style="s2">now I realize so I feel like he&#39;s losing</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.870" end="00:22:32.520" style="s2">that Center so another thing that&#39;s come</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.030" end="00:22:35.280" style="s2">up in the comments is that what is most</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.520" end="00:22:37.020" style="s2">striking about the podcast is that all</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.280" end="00:22:40.020" style="s2">the advice we were giving Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.020" end="00:22:41.970" style="s2">applies much much more to the regressive</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.020" end="00:22:45.510" style="s2">left the kind of social justice mindset</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.970" end="00:22:47.820" style="s2">by a factor of like a million what are</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.510" end="00:22:52.890" style="s2">your thoughts yes it&#39;s true absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.820" end="00:22:57.270" style="s2">true it does doesn&#39;t mean that that 2%</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.890" end="00:22:59.220" style="s2">or 5% is irrelevant and I&#39;ve written</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.270" end="00:23:01.230" style="s2">extensively about kind of less</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.220" end="00:23:03.860" style="s2">reactivity and we will talk a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.230" end="00:23:05.970" style="s2">about that but it doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.860" end="00:23:11.160" style="s2">there is nothing to learn on the other</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.970" end="00:23:12.960" style="s2">side and I&#39;ve kind of reflect on Jocko</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.160" end="00:23:14.280" style="s2">Willick Peterson&#39;s been on jaha willing</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.960" end="00:23:20.130" style="s2">to podcast he talks about extreme</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.280" end="00:23:22.110" style="s2">ownership the buck stops with me he</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.130" end="00:23:22.800" style="s2">talks about when things went wrong up on</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.110" end="00:23:25.110" style="s2">a tour in Iraq</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.800" end="00:23:26.790" style="s2">and he just said it&#39;s my fault good if</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.110" end="00:23:28.020" style="s2">you say it&#39;s my fault whatever reaction</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.790" end="00:23:29.520" style="s2">you&#39;re getting whatever people are</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.020" end="00:23:29.940" style="s2">misunderstanding if you say it&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.520" end="00:23:33.720" style="s2">fault</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.940" end="00:23:35.100" style="s2">suddenly you&#39;re you then have some</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.720" end="00:23:36.990" style="s2">ownership of it if you just keep saying</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.100" end="00:23:38.610" style="s2">no it&#39;s just then it&#39;s just then they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.990" end="00:23:40.050" style="s2">doing this they&#39;re doing this then</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.610" end="00:23:41.550" style="s2">that&#39;s a very weak position to be in</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.050" end="00:23:42.900" style="s2">because you can&#39;t do anything about it</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.550" end="00:23:45.090" style="s2">if you accept that you can do anything</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.900" end="00:23:47.550" style="s2">about anything then you&#39;re empowering</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.090" end="00:23:50.520" style="s2">yourself there&#39;s this other sense of if</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.550" end="00:23:53.280" style="s2">you&#39;re in an argument with someone you</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.520" end="00:23:55.200" style="s2">and you can&#39;t seem to get through it and</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.280" end="00:23:59.490" style="s2">you can tell they&#39;re being completely</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.200" end="00:24:02.370" style="s2">unreasonable the only way out of that</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.490" end="00:24:03.690" style="s2">argument either you kind of fight or you</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.370" end="00:24:04.780" style="s2">don&#39;t see that person anymore if you</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.690" end="00:24:07.240" style="s2">want to get through that argue</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.780" end="00:24:08.290" style="s2">and says a family member and you have no</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.240" end="00:24:10.990" style="s2">choice but to get through that argument</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.290" end="00:24:12.810" style="s2">if you are seeing more of the dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.990" end="00:24:14.950" style="s2">than the person who&#39;s reacting to you</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.810" end="00:24:19.000" style="s2">you&#39;re the only one that can shift that</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.950" end="00:24:20.470" style="s2">dynamic actually is that unfair if</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.000" end="00:24:23.140" style="s2">they&#39;re being unreasonable yes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.470" end="00:24:26.140" style="s2">completely unfair tough life is unfair</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.140" end="00:24:27.460" style="s2">but you the only person who can shift</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.140" end="00:24:29.590" style="s2">the dynamics is the person who&#39;s seen</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.460" end="00:24:31.090" style="s2">the bigger picture and I think Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.590" end="00:24:34.840" style="s2">has the capacity to see a bigger picture</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.090" end="00:24:36.990" style="s2">that the media just doesn&#39;t have and I</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.840" end="00:24:41.320" style="s2">do think there are there are ways of</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.990" end="00:24:43.840" style="s2">framing that will at least kind of talk</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.320" end="00:24:48.330" style="s2">to the middle if not yeah the extremes</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.840" end="00:24:51.550" style="s2">are kind of unreachable I think that</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.330" end="00:24:55.360" style="s2">Peterson he&#39;s channeling like this this</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.550" end="00:24:58.120" style="s2">old spirit of the divine masculine and</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.360" end="00:25:00.430" style="s2">it is absolutely essential we cannot do</p>

<p begin="00:25:00.430" end="00:25:04.540" style="s2">thing into the culture in a big way and</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.200" end="00:25:07.000" style="s2">his successes shows how much we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.540" end="00:25:10.600" style="s2">thirsting for it this this important</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.000" end="00:25:13.180" style="s2">masculine energy but it needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.600" end="00:25:17.680" style="s2">matched by a feminine energy of equal</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.180" end="00:25:19.030" style="s2">power and weight because and I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.680" end="00:25:20.710" style="s2">this is this is why I think there is</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.030" end="00:25:22.090" style="s2">some truth in like the New York Times</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.710" end="00:25:25.000" style="s2">article that called him custodian of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.090" end="00:25:28.420" style="s2">patriarchy I think on some level I do</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.000" end="00:25:30.250" style="s2">think he may and may be quite rightly is</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.420" end="00:25:32.410" style="s2">concerned about what&#39;s happened since</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.250" end="00:25:34.030" style="s2">the 60s like we have started sharing</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.410" end="00:25:35.920" style="s2">space between men and women is that</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.030" end="00:25:37.690" style="s2">gonna work out or is there not going to</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.920" end="00:25:39.760" style="s2">work out we don&#39;t know it&#39;s clearly</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.690" end="00:25:41.290" style="s2">creating huge difficulties and I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.760" end="00:25:43.150" style="s2">he&#39;s genuinely not sure whether it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.290" end="00:25:44.770" style="s2">good idea or a bad idea I think people</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.150" end="00:25:49.600" style="s2">are picking up on that and criticizing</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.770" end="00:25:51.250" style="s2">him for it but ultimately we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.600" end="00:25:52.780" style="s2">going to wind the clock back we are</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.250" end="00:25:55.030" style="s2">going to have to go through and forward</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.780" end="00:25:58.900" style="s2">and find this synthesis which is going</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.030" end="00:26:02.200" style="s2">to be as Jordan Greenhalgh talks about</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.900" end="00:26:02.980" style="s2">what we have and he also frames it by</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.200" end="00:26:04.360" style="s2">saying these are very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.980" end="00:26:05.680" style="s2">conversations to have these are hugely</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.360" end="00:26:07.360" style="s2">important but very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.680" end="00:26:11.980" style="s2">conversations to have we have the</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.360" end="00:26:13.390" style="s2">feminine rising into power power and we</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.980" end="00:26:15.040" style="s2">also need the feminine to rise into</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.390" end="00:26:17.080" style="s2">responsibility at the same time and</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.040" end="00:26:19.810" style="s2">those two things need</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.080" end="00:26:23.440" style="s2">happen need to happen at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.810" end="00:26:27.520" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s certainly true that women</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.440" end="00:26:29.080" style="s2">now have power to destroy men destroy</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.520" end="00:26:32.650" style="s2">men&#39;s reputations destroy men&#39;s careers</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.080" end="00:26:34.540" style="s2">and that power and it&#39;s it&#39;s right that</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.650" end="00:26:36.010" style="s2">some people do have their careers</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.540" end="00:26:38.350" style="s2">destroyed and some people do have the</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.010" end="00:26:39.820" style="s2">reputations ruined that&#39;s right we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.350" end="00:26:43.030" style="s2">not going back to the 1950s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.820" end="00:26:46.450" style="s2">madmen culture but also that with great</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.030" end="00:26:49.570" style="s2">power comes great responsibility I think</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.450" end="00:26:51.760" style="s2">for me what woke me up as a woman about</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.570" end="00:26:54.730" style="s2">Jordan Peterson was that he was</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.760" end="00:26:57.400" style="s2">beginning to talk about a longing in</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.730" end="00:26:59.590" style="s2">culture and longing we are in this time</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.400" end="00:27:01.660" style="s2">of cares and where are the axioms where</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.590" end="00:27:04.840" style="s2">are the things that are true at a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.660" end="00:27:07.570" style="s2">levels and you know as women we already</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.840" end="00:27:09.520" style="s2">know that there are these truths we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.570" end="00:27:12.160" style="s2">just been really really trained to not</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.520" end="00:27:16.450" style="s2">feel it and not speak it and he speaks</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.160" end="00:27:18.790" style="s2">to her but and I really like the way</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.450" end="00:27:21.040" style="s2">that he&#39;s saying hello man where are you</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.790" end="00:27:23.860" style="s2">where is a divine masculine because the</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.040" end="00:27:25.390" style="s2">divine feminine has has come massively</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.860" end="00:27:27.460" style="s2">into the world none of the divine</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.390" end="00:27:30.670" style="s2">feminine but you know that with a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.460" end="00:27:33.670" style="s2">shadow as well Carly exactly chopping</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.670" end="00:27:36.970" style="s2">off and saying enough yeah but it&#39;s run</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.670" end="00:27:39.010" style="s2">amok and we need the divine masculine we</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.970" end="00:27:41.860" style="s2">need to strong the deep the mature</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.010" end="00:27:45.580" style="s2">masculine to stand up and say I&#39;m here</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.860" end="00:27:48.610" style="s2">and we need we need the feminine to do</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.580" end="00:27:52.120" style="s2">the same and that&#39;s what I feel is is</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.610" end="00:27:54.850" style="s2">what Peterson is is pointing yet but</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.120" end="00:27:56.680" style="s2">missing out and he&#39;s speaking more he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.850" end="00:27:59.170" style="s2">speaking more to men he&#39;s speaking more</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.680" end="00:28:01.150" style="s2">to the masculine I don&#39;t feel that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.170" end="00:28:04.060" style="s2">saying the feminine is not important at</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.150" end="00:28:06.610" style="s2">all but he&#39;s creating a space and I want</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.060" end="00:28:08.230" style="s2">women to stand up and say okay what is</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.610" end="00:28:11.950" style="s2">this space from a woman&#39;s perspective</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.230" end="00:28:14.160" style="s2">how can we fill this space but this and</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.950" end="00:28:16.540" style="s2">this also you were just saying the</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.160" end="00:28:18.730" style="s2">Divine Feminine is showing up a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.540" end="00:28:20.290" style="s2">Carly at the moment brilliant kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.730" end="00:28:23.610" style="s2">archetypal framework and it&#39;s like and</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.290" end="00:28:26.890" style="s2">it&#39;s absolutely right that she does</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.610" end="00:28:28.360" style="s2">because men need to find their their</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.890" end="00:28:30.210" style="s2">grounding men need to find their balls</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.360" end="00:28:35.820" style="s2">men need to find to stay</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.210" end="00:28:38.760" style="s2">masculinity and say enough women test</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.820" end="00:28:40.710" style="s2">men to see how grounded they are that</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.760" end="00:28:44.370" style="s2">happens automatically it needs to happen</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.710" end="00:28:46.980" style="s2">women evolutionarily that has to happen</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.370" end="00:28:48.740" style="s2">women have to test men like you women</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.980" end="00:28:52.080" style="s2">had a far bigger investment in</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.740" end="00:28:54.330" style="s2">childbirth and bringing up children and</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.080" end="00:28:56.010" style="s2">so women constantly test men they it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.330" end="00:28:57.270" style="s2">an evolutionary necessity and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.010" end="00:28:59.730" style="s2">actually something that&#39;s very valuable</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.270" end="00:29:03.060" style="s2">to men too for that to happen it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.730" end="00:29:04.830" style="s2">that&#39;s how we evolved is is through that</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.060" end="00:29:06.210" style="s2">kind of being tested and standing in our</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.830" end="00:29:10.140" style="s2">truth and standing in our masculinity</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.210" end="00:29:12.180" style="s2">and women are very there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.140" end="00:29:14.820" style="s2">idea of men or concept</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.180" end="00:29:16.440" style="s2">men test ideas and women test men now</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.820" end="00:29:18.270" style="s2">it&#39;s very easy to misunderstand that and</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.440" end="00:29:21.470" style="s2">say well do you mean women don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.270" end="00:29:25.200" style="s2">ideas that&#39;s outrageous did it is no but</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.470" end="00:29:28.530" style="s2">that has always been the truth women</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.200" end="00:29:30.180" style="s2">have a much more direct kind of sense of</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.530" end="00:29:32.100" style="s2">when someone&#39;s really aligned when</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.180" end="00:29:34.920" style="s2">someone&#39;s really grounded so men may</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.100" end="00:29:36.540" style="s2">test ideas but they may not be connected</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.920" end="00:29:37.800" style="s2">to any sort of deeper emotional truth</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.540" end="00:29:40.290" style="s2">and they can go off on all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.800" end="00:29:43.110" style="s2">directions women in the past have been</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.290" end="00:29:45.150" style="s2">really good at kind of seeing where the</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.110" end="00:29:46.260" style="s2">alignment is and I think men are</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.150" end="00:29:48.360" style="s2">developing more emotional intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.260" end="00:29:50.970" style="s2">are more able to do that than before but</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.360" end="00:29:53.370" style="s2">I still think women have a deeper lived</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.970" end="00:29:55.170" style="s2">biological reality of really really</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.370" end="00:29:57.900" style="s2">seeing that deeper alignment and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.170" end="00:29:59.400" style="s2">why the me to discussion again that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.900" end="00:30:01.620" style="s2">why it&#39;s really interesting because it</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.400" end="00:30:03.780" style="s2">shows these dynamics because what&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.620" end="00:30:06.150" style="s2">happening right now is that women have</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.780" end="00:30:08.360" style="s2">really really gone from him and really</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.150" end="00:30:11.750" style="s2">really testing and said speaking up</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.360" end="00:30:14.600" style="s2">challenging and what&#39;s happened is that</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.750" end="00:30:17.220" style="s2">men have kind of retreated to the corner</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.600" end="00:30:19.220" style="s2">gotten defensive or have really lost the</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.220" end="00:30:22.500" style="s2">masculinity given away their balls and</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.220" end="00:30:25.830" style="s2">what we&#39;re not seeing is that men are</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.500" end="00:30:27.930" style="s2">stepping up and saying okay enough but</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.830" end="00:30:30.780" style="s2">from a grounded perspective from a</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.930" end="00:30:31.380" style="s2">perspective of hearing and embracing the</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.780" end="00:30:34.210" style="s2">pain</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.380" end="00:30:37.119" style="s2">but also saying there&#39;s there&#39;s a limit</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.210" end="00:30:40.299" style="s2">because the feminine needs that that</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.119" end="00:30:44.019" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s no fun if we keep running and</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.299" end="00:30:46.179" style="s2">running and and and nailing men per se</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.019" end="00:30:49.419" style="s2">on everything like creating a society</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.179" end="00:30:51.159" style="s2">where where where men are dangerous for</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.419" end="00:30:53.679" style="s2">women and this is what you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.159" end="00:30:56.169" style="s2">that&#39;s a danger for what&#39;s happening if</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.679" end="00:30:59.200" style="s2">we don&#39;t have a much more balanced</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.169" end="00:31:02.259" style="s2">conversation about this because as women</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.200" end="00:31:05.649" style="s2">we don&#39;t want all the power we want we</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.259" end="00:31:08.580" style="s2">want to share that space and and it</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.649" end="00:31:12.279" style="s2">seems like we both forgotten that we so</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.580" end="00:31:14.139" style="s2">we&#39;re so engaged in the antagonism in</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.279" end="00:31:16.119" style="s2">clearing the space that we forget why</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.139" end="00:31:17.499" style="s2">we&#39;re clearing it what one I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.119" end="00:31:20.259" style="s2">come back to what do we want to fill</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.499" end="00:31:22.960" style="s2">that space with what is the synthesis</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.259" end="00:31:26.529" style="s2">look like what does the what would a</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.960" end="00:31:28.450" style="s2">healthy relationship look like I love</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.529" end="00:31:30.879" style="s2">this question because this is the most</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.450" end="00:31:32.710" style="s2">open question we can have right now I</p>
