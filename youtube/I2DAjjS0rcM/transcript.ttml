<p begin="00:00:08.639" end="00:00:13.259" style="s2">a pretty good job of being in a solvent</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.530" end="00:00:14.969" style="s2">and being a catalyst so my intent is in</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.259" end="00:00:16.890" style="s2">fact to do that for this group to the</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.969" end="00:00:17.970" style="s2">extent that I can and an answer to</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.890" end="00:00:20.369" style="s2">something you brought up which is very</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.970" end="00:00:21.869" style="s2">important my commitment is to interact</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.369" end="00:00:23.880" style="s2">in good faith to the best so that I</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.869" end="00:00:27.330" style="s2">don&#39;t do that to my ability so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.880" end="00:00:28.380" style="s2">the front end so starting off the Tyler</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.330" end="00:00:30.359" style="s2">was I don&#39;t know something about</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.380" end="00:00:33.390" style="s2">complexity probably the better title be</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.359" end="00:00:36.030" style="s2">like is up and stuff the</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.390" end="00:00:38.520" style="s2">notion is that we&#39;ve got a toolkit it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.030" end="00:00:40.649" style="s2">a legacy toolkit that toolkit sucks it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.520" end="00:00:42.570" style="s2">broken it doesn&#39;t work very well we have</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.649" end="00:00:44.309" style="s2">to free ourselves of that toolkit</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.570" end="00:00:45.480" style="s2">because intuitively whenever we come</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.309" end="00:00:47.129" style="s2">across a problem we&#39;re going to reach</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.480" end="00:00:48.360" style="s2">into it and try to solve the problem</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.129" end="00:00:49.890" style="s2">with that toolkit so we&#39;ve got to figure</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.360" end="00:00:51.840" style="s2">out how to break our mind of that and</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.890" end="00:00:52.920" style="s2">then reconstitute a new toolkit I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.840" end="00:00:53.280" style="s2">interested to find out what it looks</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.920" end="00:00:56.340" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.280" end="00:00:58.920" style="s2">so think different think very different</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.340" end="00:01:00.239" style="s2">now we&#39;ve done this before fortunately</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.920" end="00:01:01.739" style="s2">this is not the first time we&#39;ve been to</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.239" end="00:01:04.049" style="s2">this rodeo so I&#39;ll take the example of</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.739" end="00:01:05.280" style="s2">journalism this is legacy journalism now</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.049" end="00:01:07.380" style="s2">unfortunately when you go to certain</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.280" end="00:01:08.479" style="s2">circumstances back in the 2000 timeframe</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.380" end="00:01:10.950" style="s2">and everybody talked about</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.479" end="00:01:12.510" style="s2">reconstituting journalism they thought</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.950" end="00:01:13.650" style="s2">that&#39;s what reconstituting doodles would</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.510" end="00:01:15.150" style="s2">look like alright because you take your</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.650" end="00:01:16.320" style="s2">toolkit you turn the crank on journalism</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.150" end="00:01:18.540" style="s2">I think the New York Times I put it on</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.320" end="00:01:20.549" style="s2">my computer yeah but of course in fact</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.540" end="00:01:22.020" style="s2">we know that that&#39;s actually what</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.549" end="00:01:24.210" style="s2">journalism looks like in the 21st</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.020" end="00:01:27.299" style="s2">century you boil it down to the base</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.210" end="00:01:29.189" style="s2">functions journalism is the sourcing the</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.299" end="00:01:30.810" style="s2">qualification and the dissemination of</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.189" end="00:01:32.880" style="s2">information into a network that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.810" end="00:01:35.280" style="s2">journalism is as a fundamental function</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.880" end="00:01:37.140" style="s2">is that the same category as science</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.280" end="00:01:39.900" style="s2">although of course different many ways</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.140" end="00:01:41.100" style="s2">and then you begin to imagine using your</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.900" end="00:01:42.479" style="s2">new toolkit how do you create</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.100" end="00:01:45.180" style="s2">instruments to affect that particular</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.479" end="00:01:46.409" style="s2">function so that&#39;s the basic idea of</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.180" end="00:01:47.939" style="s2">what we have to do in general with</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.409" end="00:01:51.990" style="s2">journalism being a base great case is</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.939" end="00:01:53.729" style="s2">point okay so what is governance if we</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.990" end="00:01:55.200" style="s2">take that particular mode right what are</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.729" end="00:01:57.299" style="s2">the core functions of this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.200" end="00:01:59.219" style="s2">governance and it&#39;s trying to solve a</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.299" end="00:02:00.540" style="s2">couple of basic fundamental problems</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.219" end="00:02:02.549" style="s2">that seem to emerge in any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.540" end="00:02:04.740" style="s2">coordination Network the coordination</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.549" end="00:02:06.630" style="s2">problem the prisoner&#39;s dilemma collected</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.740" end="00:02:08.520" style="s2">decision-making the tragedy the Commons</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.630" end="00:02:10.440" style="s2">conflict management it may be bigger or</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.520" end="00:02:13.319" style="s2">smaller that&#39;s the basic ideas it&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.440" end="00:02:15.749" style="s2">bucket of things that look like this</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.319" end="00:02:17.249" style="s2">now the legacy toolkit has a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.749" end="00:02:20.489" style="s2">solid way of trying to solve these</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.249" end="00:02:21.989" style="s2">problems to Leviathan and what we</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.489" end="00:02:24.930" style="s2">currently live in you might call the</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.989" end="00:02:26.189" style="s2">peak predator of Leviathan space they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.930" end="00:02:27.540" style="s2">been evolving against each other</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.189" end="00:02:27.959" style="s2">competing a wide variety of different</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.540" end="00:02:29.760" style="s2">ways</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.959" end="00:02:30.989" style="s2">pending unfortunately on occasion to</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.760" end="00:02:33.540" style="s2">figure out how to systematically kill</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.989" end="00:02:35.519" style="s2">each other and almost all of our toolkit</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.540" end="00:02:37.409" style="s2">is some modulation on Leviathan space</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.519" end="00:02:40.290" style="s2">call it sovereignty at the top</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.409" end="00:02:44.790" style="s2">percolating down hierarchy bureaucracy</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.290" end="00:02:47.519" style="s2">commodification normalization etc Center</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.790" end="00:02:49.620" style="s2">ok then we have to do is we have to do</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.519" end="00:02:51.269" style="s2">something different so these are the</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.620" end="00:02:53.340" style="s2">design constraints on any future</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.269" end="00:02:54.510" style="s2">instruments in the 21st century this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.340" end="00:02:55.859" style="s2">by no means comprehensive that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.510" end="00:02:57.540" style="s2">probably wrong with the idea to try to</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.859" end="00:03:00.480" style="s2">start gesturing in the right direction</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.540" end="00:03:02.099" style="s2">some key ideas decentralization if</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.480" end="00:03:04.650" style="s2">you&#39;re building something which requires</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.099" end="00:03:06.389" style="s2">a transcendent institution to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.650" end="00:03:08.549" style="s2">solve those governance problems you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.389" end="00:03:10.169" style="s2">probably doing something wrong you have</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.549" end="00:03:11.579" style="s2">to focus first and foremost in building</p>
