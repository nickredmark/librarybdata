<p begin="00:02:39.180" end="00:02:43.410" style="s2">through all of January and you were</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.640" end="00:02:47.010" style="s2">getting some pretty invasive surgery</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.410" end="00:02:52.530" style="s2">done on your foot and then your mom and</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.010" end="00:02:54.480" style="s2">I Tammy and I went to Australia New</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.530" end="00:02:57.090" style="s2">Zealand for most of February and that</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.480" end="00:02:58.440" style="s2">was actually not too bad a trip I felt</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.090" end="00:03:00.930" style="s2">all right and she was feeling all right</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.440" end="00:03:03.300" style="s2">- but we knew her surgery for what was</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.930" end="00:03:06.690" style="s2">hypothetically a relatively treatable</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.300" end="00:03:08.670" style="s2">cancer was coming up in March so that</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.690" end="00:03:12.810" style="s2">was hanging over our heads</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.670" end="00:03:14.550" style="s2">although we weren&#39;t overwhelmingly</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.810" end="00:03:17.420" style="s2">worried about it and then she went and</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.550" end="00:03:17.420" style="s2">had her surgery and</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.590" end="00:03:22.780" style="s2">they then we were informed six weeks</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.380" end="00:03:26.290" style="s2">after that after she had recovered but</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.780" end="00:03:29.740" style="s2">was still suffering some pain that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.290" end="00:03:34.870" style="s2">easily treatable and non dangerous slow</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.740" end="00:03:37.870" style="s2">growing malignancy that we were told she</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.870" end="00:03:41.200" style="s2">had was in fact something fast growing</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.870" end="00:03:43.330" style="s2">with about with a some something near a</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.200" end="00:03:46.240" style="s2">hundred percent fatality rate within a</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.330" end="00:03:48.610" style="s2">year regardless of treatment mm-hmm like</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.240" end="00:03:51.190" style="s2">treating cancer like yeah so that was</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.610" end="00:03:53.320" style="s2">deadly we got all we were told that in</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.190" end="00:03:56.380" style="s2">about ten minutes and so when we were</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.320" end="00:04:00.850" style="s2">just expecting uh well if not a clean</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.380" end="00:04:03.989" style="s2">bill of health at least a we represent a</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.850" end="00:04:03.989" style="s2">ssin of what we&#39;d already been told</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.050" end="00:04:10.110" style="s2">she went in to have more invasive</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.710" end="00:04:12.090" style="s2">surgery and hypothetically that work but</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.110" end="00:04:14.810" style="s2">it created syrup terrible side effects</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.090" end="00:04:18.450" style="s2">and that was the start of a whole other</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.810" end="00:04:20.280" style="s2">six months long nightmare of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.450" end="00:04:23.820" style="s2">deal with surgical complications which</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.280" end="00:04:26.910" style="s2">we did eventually resolve but not until</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.820" end="00:04:29.010" style="s2">mid the middle of August in fact not and</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.910" end="00:04:34.639" style="s2">literally not until the day of our 30th</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.010" end="00:04:37.320" style="s2">wedding anniversary yeah so that was all</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.639" end="00:04:37.830" style="s2">hare-raising and stressful to say the</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.320" end="00:04:39.720" style="s2">least</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.830" end="00:04:42.720" style="s2">I mean you know I&#39;ve talked about that</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.720" end="00:04:45.930" style="s2">but we seem to have a life-threatening</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.720" end="00:04:51.230" style="s2">emergency on Tammy&#39;s part for both every</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.930" end="00:04:51.230" style="s2">three days for about six months and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.220" end="00:04:58.180" style="s2">I had my own problem start to develop</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.440" end="00:05:01.520" style="s2">really in with any degree of severity in</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.180" end="00:05:04.270" style="s2">about April May something like that I</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.520" end="00:05:07.730" style="s2">had been taking benzodiazepines since</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.270" end="00:05:11.290" style="s2">2016 so why be before we get into there</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.730" end="00:05:16.310" style="s2">what why why did you start taking</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.290" end="00:05:21.100" style="s2">benzodiazepines well in in over the</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.310" end="00:05:24.290" style="s2">Christmas vacation in 2016 you and I and</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.100" end="00:05:27.440" style="s2">Julianne and my son and Tammy went out</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.290" end="00:05:34.550" style="s2">to Vancouver Island to visit her parents</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.440" end="00:05:36.680" style="s2">and siblings and when we were there you</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.550" end="00:05:39.470" style="s2">and I and Andre your husband ate</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.680" end="00:05:42.140" style="s2">something that</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.470" end="00:05:44.420" style="s2">didn&#39;t agree with any of us and solve a</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.140" end="00:05:48.500" style="s2">very severe reaction to that I&#39;m so</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.420" end="00:05:50.250" style="s2">unborn it was logical conclusion but I</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.500" end="00:05:52.830" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.250" end="00:05:55.560" style="s2">well it the same we have the same</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.830" end="00:05:57.450" style="s2">symptoms I don&#39;t know if I was any more</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.560" end="00:06:00.000" style="s2">seriously affected than you or not but I</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.450" end="00:06:01.350" style="s2">was freezing cold for about a month I</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.000" end="00:06:03.240" style="s2">couldn&#39;t get warm no matter how much I</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.350" end="00:06:07.290" style="s2">wore I couldn&#39;t stand up without</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.240" end="00:06:10.770" style="s2">fainting I couldn&#39;t sleep I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.290" end="00:06:12.660" style="s2">I slept at all for for something on the</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.770" end="00:06:15.210" style="s2">in the or on the order of three weeks</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.660" end="00:06:17.010" style="s2">yeah people like you went on Joe Rogan</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.210" end="00:06:18.720" style="s2">and talked about a sulphite reaction you</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.010" end="00:06:20.910" style="s2">had and how you didn&#39;t sleep and people</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.720" end="00:06:22.740" style="s2">commented that oh it&#39;s not possible to</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.910" end="00:06:25.310" style="s2">stay awake for that long but if you</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.740" end="00:06:27.710" style="s2">actually look into sodium metabisulfite</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.310" end="00:06:30.060" style="s2">allergies the symptoms that we</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.710" end="00:06:32.220" style="s2">experienced aren&#39;t unheard of there are</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.060" end="00:06:34.770" style="s2">people it&#39;s also impossible to stay</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.220" end="00:06:36.390" style="s2">awake voluntarily that long that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.770" end="00:06:38.280" style="s2">the same as not being able to sleep</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.390" end="00:06:40.770" style="s2">those are very very different things</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.280" end="00:06:43.110" style="s2">whatever it&#39;s possible that when I was</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.770" end="00:06:44.820" style="s2">laying there thinking I wasn&#39;t sleeping</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.110" end="00:06:46.560" style="s2">that now and then I drifted off and</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.820" end="00:06:50.430" style="s2">would wake up and not notice I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.560" end="00:06:51.930" style="s2">can&#39;t eliminate that as a possibility</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.430" end="00:06:55.010" style="s2">but I can certainly tell you that I</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.930" end="00:06:57.990" style="s2">slept little enough so that it was</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.010" end="00:07:00.810" style="s2">exceedingly unpleasant it&#39;s a very long</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.990" end="00:07:03.020" style="s2">time to stay awake and when we went back</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.810" end="00:07:06.270" style="s2">to Toronto our family physician</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.020" end="00:07:08.160" style="s2">prescribed benzodiazepines which are</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.270" end="00:07:10.080" style="s2">often used as a sleeping aid and an</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.160" end="00:07:13.440" style="s2">anti-anxiety medication and is something</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.080" end="00:07:15.419" style="s2">called zopiclone in moving and I hardly</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.440" end="00:07:21.320" style="s2">took the EMA vein at all maybe four or</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.419" end="00:07:21.320" style="s2">five times but I took the</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.920" end="00:07:27.440" style="s2">benzodiazepine the way that it was</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.620" end="00:07:31.070" style="s2">prescribed to twice a day point to five</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.440" end="00:07:33.620" style="s2">milligrams and that seemed to bring the</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.070" end="00:07:34.880" style="s2">symptoms to a pretty rapid halt which is</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.620" end="00:07:37.130" style="s2">also part of the reason I didn&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.880" end="00:07:39.410" style="s2">the EMA vein and then there are so many</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.130" end="00:07:42.170" style="s2">other things going on around me at that</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.410" end="00:07:44.030" style="s2">time that I never really thought about</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.170" end="00:07:46.100" style="s2">it again you know I thought they were</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.030" end="00:07:49.400" style="s2">that it was a relatively harmless drug</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.100" end="00:07:53.120" style="s2">and I was taking it in a prescribed</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.400" end="00:07:55.850" style="s2">fashion at not too high a dose and</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.120" end="00:07:58.960" style="s2">I developed symptoms that I now</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.850" end="00:08:02.449" style="s2">recognized were associated with its use</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.960" end="00:08:06.350" style="s2">weakness on the my left side and like a</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.449" end="00:08:09.290" style="s2">feeling of detachment from people around</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.350" end="00:08:15.110" style="s2">me people I loved some decrease in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.290" end="00:08:17.020" style="s2">ability to experience joy but it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.110" end="00:08:19.430" style="s2">until much later that I actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.020" end="00:08:22.790" style="s2">associated with the pince-nez being use</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.430" end="00:08:26.810" style="s2">yeah when well when your mom got so sick</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.790" end="00:08:30.620" style="s2">my anxiety levels had been climbing up</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.810" end="00:08:33.169" style="s2">again yeah that was unbearable I mean</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.620" end="00:08:37.380" style="s2">the response I had if you&#39;re told your</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.169" end="00:08:39.990" style="s2">parent or your wife of almost 30 years</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.380" end="00:08:41.430" style="s2">has no chance and is going to be dead in</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.990" end="00:08:43.470" style="s2">the next ten months that&#39;s what we were</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.430" end="00:08:45.180" style="s2">told that surgery doesn&#39;t help and that</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.470" end="00:08:47.010" style="s2">chemo doesn&#39;t help and that this is a</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.180" end="00:08:48.960" style="s2">fast-growing cancer and you&#39;re screwed</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.010" end="00:08:51.810" style="s2">no matter what right what we heard in</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.960" end="00:08:54.000" style="s2">one day anxiety went all over North</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.810" end="00:08:56.760" style="s2">America to New York and to Houston and</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.000" end="00:08:58.890" style="s2">to LA looking for different opinions</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.760" end="00:09:00.690" style="s2">before we decided to settle on surgery</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.890" end="00:09:03.240" style="s2">but and everyone gave us the same</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.690" end="00:09:05.010" style="s2">opinion yes which was that nothing is</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.240" end="00:09:08.220" style="s2">going to help but surgery was probably</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.010" end="00:09:12.480" style="s2">the best mm-hmm the best low-probability</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.220" end="00:09:15.180" style="s2">bet yes so so so I asked my doctor to</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.480" end="00:09:17.010" style="s2">increase the benzodiazepine dose but</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.180" end="00:09:18.780" style="s2">what seemed to happen as a consequence</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.010" end="00:09:23.070" style="s2">of that was that I just got more anxious</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.780" end="00:09:27.180" style="s2">like so again in retrospect it seems</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.070" end="00:09:30.560" style="s2">like I had a rather uncommon but not</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.180" end="00:09:35.250" style="s2">unheard of reaction to benzodiazepines</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.560" end="00:09:40.500" style="s2">where increased dose makes anxiety worse</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.250" end="00:09:41.940" style="s2">instead of better so then at one point</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.500" end="00:09:43.440" style="s2">when things weren&#39;t getting better and</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.940" end="00:09:45.120" style="s2">Tami was still in the hospital I was</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.440" end="00:09:47.910" style="s2">trying to take care of her we had lots</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.120" end="00:09:51.420" style="s2">of help I stopped taking them entirely</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.910" end="00:09:54.090" style="s2">and tried ketamine which is a treatment</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.420" end="00:09:56.310" style="s2">for depression while that neither of</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.090" end="00:10:00.170" style="s2">those were very good ideas as it turned</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.310" end="00:10:00.170" style="s2">out so</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.620" end="00:10:06.890" style="s2">I had to stop taking benzodiazepines</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.100" end="00:10:11.030" style="s2">entirely</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.890" end="00:10:14.660" style="s2">the ketamine oh yeah yeah then I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.030" end="00:10:17.180" style="s2">go then I stayed off them for something</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.660" end="00:10:20.090" style="s2">approximating a week not knowing that</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.180" end="00:10:21.440" style="s2">that was a very bad idea and I often</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.090" end="00:10:24.260" style="s2">think I should have known these things</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.440" end="00:10:25.580" style="s2">because I did a lot of scientific</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.260" end="00:10:28.490" style="s2">research when I was a graduate student</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.580" end="00:10:29.980" style="s2">on alcoholism and I knew that alcohol</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.490" end="00:10:31.820" style="s2">and benzodiazepines and barbiturates</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.980" end="00:10:34.370" style="s2">were all the same</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.820" end="00:10:38.060" style="s2">chemical class at least in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.370" end="00:10:41.600" style="s2">their effect on neurological effects and</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.060" end="00:10:43.190" style="s2">but what I knew about benzodiazepines</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.600" end="00:10:44.870" style="s2">was that they were comparatively safe</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.190" end="00:10:48.590" style="s2">compared to barbiturates which they</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.870" end="00:10:50.540" style="s2">basically replaced but that&#39;s much less</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.590" end="00:10:53.210" style="s2">true than everybody who&#39;s taking them</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.540" end="00:10:54.890" style="s2">hopes and they&#39;re very widely prescribed</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.210" end="00:10:56.960" style="s2">and I don&#39;t remember what the</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.890" end="00:10:58.370" style="s2">probability of developing a dependency</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.960" end="00:11:00.470" style="s2">on them is if you take them for more</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.370" end="00:11:02.540" style="s2">than two weeks it&#39;s 50% I believe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.470" end="00:11:03.920" style="s2">something like 50% yeah if you take them</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.540" end="00:11:06.830" style="s2">for two or four weeks</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.920" end="00:11:09.590" style="s2">yeah and over four weeks it&#39;s much much</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.830" end="00:11:11.330" style="s2">higher most people prescribed them stay</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.590" end="00:11:12.410" style="s2">on them for life and that could have</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.330" end="00:11:13.760" style="s2">something to do with the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.410" end="00:11:15.920" style="s2">they&#39;re very difficult to get off of</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.760" end="00:11:17.780" style="s2">yeah well it was unbelievably unpleasant</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.920" end="00:11:19.690" style="s2">I mean it was unbearably unpleasant and</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.780" end="00:11:23.410" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.690" end="00:11:25.720" style="s2">I started stopping started tapering off</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.410" end="00:11:27.840" style="s2">when Tammy was in the hospital but I</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.720" end="00:11:30.730" style="s2">couldn&#39;t push that too fast because</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.840" end="00:11:32.830" style="s2">wasn&#39;t bearable and what what do you</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.730" end="00:11:36.550" style="s2">mean it wasn&#39;t well my anxiety levels</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.830" end="00:11:37.780" style="s2">went higher than I&#39;d ever than anything</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.550" end="00:11:38.980" style="s2">I&#39;d ever experienced and I also</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.780" end="00:11:42.040" style="s2">developed this condition called</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.980" end="00:11:47.010" style="s2">akathisia and the best way I can</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.040" end="00:11:51.000" style="s2">describe that is that it was like being</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.010" end="00:11:53.100" style="s2">jabbed with something look with a prod</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.000" end="00:11:56.970" style="s2">like a cattle prod something electric or</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.100" end="00:11:59.760" style="s2">something sharp non-stop for hours for</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.970" end="00:12:02.760" style="s2">all the hours I was awake was absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.760" end="00:12:08.480" style="s2">I couldn&#39;t sit or lay down or stop</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.760" end="00:12:08.480" style="s2">moving and even if I did get up and move</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.910" end="00:12:13.260" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t like that made it better I</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.070" end="00:12:13.980" style="s2">just couldn&#39;t stop doing it it was</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.260" end="00:12:16.560" style="s2">horrible</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.980" end="00:12:18.810" style="s2">a Kathi&#39;s ii is horrible it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.560" end="00:12:19.890" style="s2">it&#39;s well it&#39;s like being whipped that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.810" end="00:12:22.050" style="s2">another way of thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.890" end="00:12:24.450" style="s2">although I really think I would have you</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.050" end="00:12:27.300" style="s2">know this is sounds melodramatic but I</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.450" end="00:12:29.910" style="s2">think if I had to pick whipping or arc</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.300" end="00:12:33.690" style="s2">áthisá those it would depend on how big</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.910" end="00:12:36.930" style="s2">a whip but maybe not what an obvious</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.690" end="00:12:38.310" style="s2">choice has five pronged whips yes yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.930" end="00:12:40.410" style="s2">cat-o&#39;-nine-tails</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.310" end="00:12:43.620" style="s2">that might be worse but it was it was</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.410" end="00:12:44.970" style="s2">plenty bad yeah and so and things just</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.620" end="00:12:47.940" style="s2">fell apart more and more Tammie</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.970" end="00:12:51.330" style="s2">recovered rather miraculously in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.940" end="00:12:55.650" style="s2">middle of August and but I continued my</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.330" end="00:12:59.580" style="s2">sort of downhill spiral and ended up in</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.650" end="00:13:01.460" style="s2">a clinic in on the eastern seaboard that</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.580" end="00:13:03.360" style="s2">claim they could do a rapid yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.460" end="00:13:05.700" style="s2">benzodiazepine detox which was a</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.360" end="00:13:08.250" style="s2">complete bloody lie yeah well what we</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.700" end="00:13:10.890" style="s2">figured was we didn&#39;t realize that there</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.250" end="00:13:12.960" style="s2">was this physical dependency until you</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.890" end="00:13:16.170" style="s2">stopped to try and do the ketamine and</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.960" end="00:13:18.750" style="s2">then we tried tapering and you couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.170" end="00:13:21.270" style="s2">stand it because of the akathisia and so</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.750" end="00:13:22.350" style="s2">we thought well let&#39;s go get some</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.270" end="00:13:25.500" style="s2">professional help</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.350" end="00:13:27.780" style="s2">right and well and I went to the clinic</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.500" end="00:13:32.940" style="s2">on the understanding that they could do</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.780" end="00:13:35.130" style="s2">a multi-day detoxification and treatment</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.940" end="00:13:37.650" style="s2">for withdrawal and when I got there what</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.130" end="00:13:39.630" style="s2">they told me instead was that they&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.650" end="00:13:41.430" style="s2">substitute essentially they&#39;d substitute</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.630" end="00:13:43.500" style="s2">one benzodiazepine for another which</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.430" end="00:13:46.010" style="s2">wasn&#39;t the least bit helpful because</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.500" end="00:13:48.420" style="s2">clonazepam was already a long-acting</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.010" end="00:13:50.120" style="s2">benzodiazepine and they&#39;re easier to</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.420" end="00:13:54.030" style="s2">wean off than the shorter acting</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.120" end="00:13:55.920" style="s2">benzodiazepines and they had nothing to</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.030" end="00:13:57.830" style="s2">offer essentially I came out of that</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.920" end="00:14:03.750" style="s2">clinic worse than I when I went in</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.830" end="00:14:07.200" style="s2">so like significantly worse yes on to</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.750" end="00:14:09.000" style="s2">more sedative like drugs in order to</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.200" end="00:14:11.760" style="s2">dampen down the akathisia</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.000" end="00:14:13.710" style="s2">symptoms rights which wasn&#39;t helping</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.760" end="00:14:15.270" style="s2">much given the fact that the</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.710" end="00:14:19.230" style="s2">benzodiazepines were causing the</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.270" end="00:14:22.620" style="s2">akathisia yes yeah so and then I went</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.230" end="00:14:24.890" style="s2">back to Toronto that&#39;s November Nova</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.620" end="00:14:24.890" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.059" end="00:14:29.339" style="s2">things maintain their downhill</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.470" end="00:14:34.960" style="s2">trajectory apart from the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.360" end="00:14:38.140" style="s2">Tammy was recovering quite nicely which</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.960" end="00:14:42.160" style="s2">of course was great but then I ended up</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.140" end="00:14:45.540" style="s2">in the hospital in Toronto and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.160" end="00:14:50.710" style="s2">hospital I ended up went in was also</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.540" end="00:14:53.350" style="s2">worse than useless yes so and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.710" end="00:14:57.250" style="s2">remember this part of it it from</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.350" end="00:15:00.370" style="s2">December 15th onward you and Andre your</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.250" end="00:15:02.590" style="s2">husband took me out of that hospital and</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.370" end="00:15:07.380" style="s2">we went to Russia of all places near</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.590" end="00:15:12.970" style="s2">Moscow to try a treatment offered by</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.380" end="00:15:15.940" style="s2">clinic there that used they use proper</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.970" end="00:15:20.650" style="s2">fall index tour right right proper fall</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.940" end="00:15:23.560" style="s2">too as a heavy heavy sedating agent it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.650" end="00:15:26.500" style="s2">basically made me unconscious for nine</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.560" end="00:15:28.810" style="s2">days yeah so you were completely out for</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.500" end="00:15:30.670" style="s2">nine days well I also had pneumonia</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.810" end="00:15:32.560" style="s2">which I developed apparently in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.670" end="00:15:34.660" style="s2">hospital in Toronto oh yeah it was quite</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.560" end="00:15:37.300" style="s2">quite entertaining the whole the whole</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.660" end="00:15:39.670" style="s2">string of events we got questions about</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.300" end="00:15:41.800" style="s2">you know why why on earth would you go</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.670" end="00:15:44.140" style="s2">to Russia when you could get you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.800" end="00:15:46.750" style="s2">world-class care in North America and</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.140" end="00:15:49.720" style="s2">the reason for that was because we had</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.750" end="00:15:51.430" style="s2">tried the Ashton protocol we switching</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.720" end="00:15:53.320" style="s2">over to valium we tried the Ashton</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.430" end="00:15:55.540" style="s2">protocol and lots of people have success</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.320" end="00:15:57.490" style="s2">with that although it sounds horrible</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.540" end="00:16:00.190" style="s2">lots of people don&#39;t have success with</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.490" end="00:16:02.170" style="s2">it yeah i&#39;m i put out a the first family</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.190" end="00:16:04.090" style="s2">update we did was when you went to the</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.170" end="00:16:06.400" style="s2">first rehab center in the states and</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.090" end="00:16:09.370" style="s2">after i put that out and said this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.400" end="00:16:12.940" style="s2">what&#39;s going on I had hundreds if not</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.370" end="00:16:15.460" style="s2">thousands of people respond telling me</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.940" end="00:16:18.670" style="s2">how horrible benzodiazepine withdrawal</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.460" end="00:16:20.530" style="s2">could be how they couldn&#39;t work how they</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.670" end="00:16:23.680" style="s2">were pacing around their backyards for a</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.530" end="00:16:26.770" style="s2">year and they basically said just keep</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.680" end="00:16:29.650" style="s2">him alive make sure he psychiatrists</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.770" end="00:16:31.390" style="s2">that I spoke with said you know when I</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.650" end="00:16:32.920" style="s2">asked him how long the it&#39;s easy it was</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.390" end="00:16:35.320" style="s2">likely the last they said well it could</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.920" end="00:16:37.330" style="s2">be two years and I thought no one could</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.320" end="00:16:39.970" style="s2">live like this for two years it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.330" end="00:16:43.300" style="s2">you can&#39;t live for two years if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.970" end="00:16:45.199" style="s2">being constantly prodded with something</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.300" end="00:16:47.420" style="s2">excruciatingly ly painful on a</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.199" end="00:16:50.019" style="s2">moment-to-moment basis it&#39;s just not and</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.420" end="00:16:52.910" style="s2">there&#39;s no escape there&#39;s no relief</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.019" end="00:16:56.269" style="s2">that&#39;s just not possible wasn&#39;t possible</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.910" end="00:16:59.269" style="s2">or I sir I mean the reason I did survive</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.269" end="00:17:00.230" style="s2">certainly wasn&#39;t because I was enjoying</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.269" end="00:17:05.829" style="s2">my life</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.230" end="00:17:05.829" style="s2">the reason was is that I had family</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.929" end="00:17:13.660" style="s2">that I was very attached to and friends</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.610" end="00:17:16.140" style="s2">who went</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.660" end="00:17:19.699" style="s2">above and beyond the call of duty</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.140" end="00:17:23.270" style="s2">helping to care for me but</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.699" end="00:17:26.089" style="s2">the experience was</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.270" end="00:17:28.730" style="s2">intolerably dreadful and it&#39;s so strange</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.089" end="00:17:31.040" style="s2">was we&#39;re now in Serbia weirdly enough</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.730" end="00:17:33.350" style="s2">in Belgrade of all bloody places and</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.040" end="00:17:37.190" style="s2">we&#39;ve been here about two weeks and went</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.350" end="00:17:41.750" style="s2">to yet another specialty clinic run by</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.190" end="00:17:43.640" style="s2">an anesthesiologist and they modified</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.750" end="00:17:45.830" style="s2">the medication that I was taking in</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.640" end="00:17:49.610" style="s2">Florida which is where we were last and</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.830" end="00:17:51.610" style="s2">I don&#39;t know I can&#39;t understand it but</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.610" end="00:17:55.610" style="s2">virtually all my symptoms have</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.610" end="00:17:57.620" style="s2">disappeared I&#39;m still weak if I get up</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.610" end="00:17:59.090" style="s2">and walk around I don&#39;t have my stamina</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.620" end="00:18:03.050" style="s2">but I can think clearly</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.090" end="00:18:06.500" style="s2">I feel I&#39;m back to my regular self such</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.050" end="00:18:08.900" style="s2">as that is yeah during the mornings and</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.500" end="00:18:10.910" style="s2">during the days I can work you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.900" end="00:18:14.630" style="s2">very surprising to me that this happened</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.910" end="00:18:17.060" style="s2">so rapidly but it it has and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.630" end="00:18:20.900" style="s2">we&#39;re doing this podcast and yeah or</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.060" end="00:18:25.060" style="s2">this this this video but and hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.900" end="00:18:28.750" style="s2">the last but Tami is coming she&#39;s been I</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.060" end="00:18:31.390" style="s2">haven&#39;t been with her</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.750" end="00:18:33.700" style="s2">for more than a few days since middle of</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.390" end="00:18:36.280" style="s2">December and that was partly because I</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.700" end="00:18:41.380" style="s2">was in bad shape and she wasn&#39;t in good</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.280" end="00:18:44.560" style="s2">enough shape to be patient with me she</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.380" end="00:18:48.580" style="s2">almost died like every day for six</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.560" end="00:18:51.460" style="s2">months like you said and you were in you</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.580" end="00:18:53.800" style="s2">were suffering so much that anyone</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.460" end="00:18:56.230" style="s2">around you suffered yes because of how</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.800" end="00:18:59.470" style="s2">horrible it was to watch it was horrible</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.230" end="00:19:03.460" style="s2">so just to back up a bit you went to a</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.470" end="00:19:06.370" style="s2">hospital in Toronto and they were going</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.460" end="00:19:08.280" style="s2">to make things worse rapidly they</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.370" end="00:19:10.630" style="s2">weren&#39;t willing because of your</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.280" end="00:19:12.910" style="s2">akathisia which was making you crazy</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.630" end="00:19:15.340" style="s2">they weren&#39;t willing to slow tapered you</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.910" end="00:19:17.800" style="s2">down they just wanted to stabilize you</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.340" end="00:19:20.290" style="s2">by keeping the benzodiazepines there so</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.800" end="00:19:22.420" style="s2">Andre and I found a clinic in Russia</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.290" end="00:19:24.760" style="s2">that would actually put you to sleep</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.420" end="00:19:26.380" style="s2">using proper Falls so you wouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.760" end="00:19:29.110" style="s2">to suffer while they took the</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.380" end="00:19:31.660" style="s2">benzodiazepines out and doing a detox or</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.110" end="00:19:35.890" style="s2">as much Halla least you&#39;d be unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.660" end="00:19:37.840" style="s2">for that period time and doing a detox</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.890" end="00:19:40.750" style="s2">on benzodiazepines isn&#39;t recommended</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.840" end="00:19:43.900" style="s2">you&#39;re supposed to do a slow taper but</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.750" end="00:19:47.860" style="s2">you&#39;re akathisia was so bad that even</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.900" end="00:19:50.620" style="s2">staying at the same dose was dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.860" end="00:19:53.260" style="s2">right so we needed to get rid of that so</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.620" end="00:19:56.140" style="s2">we spent time in Russia managed to get</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.260" end="00:19:58.540" style="s2">it out and it was or well you guys took</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.140" end="00:20:01.660" style="s2">a big risk taking me out of the hospital</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.540" end="00:20:03.070" style="s2">in Toronto which nobody recommended the</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.660" end="00:20:07.840" style="s2">psychiatrist certainly weren&#39;t in favor</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.070" end="00:20:13.700" style="s2">of it and taking me somewhere as foreign</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.840" end="00:20:18.289" style="s2">as Moscow and and then attempting this</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.700" end="00:20:23.419" style="s2">what generally unadvised treatment was</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.289" end="00:20:26.620" style="s2">all surreal yeah what was terrifying and</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.419" end="00:20:26.620" style="s2">when I woke up</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.980" end="00:20:31.960" style="s2">so as I said - that was complicated by</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.950" end="00:20:34.149" style="s2">the fact that I double I had developed</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.960" end="00:20:37.509" style="s2">pneumonia in both lungs but when I woke</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.149" end="00:20:40.119" style="s2">up I was first catatonic and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.509" end="00:20:42.489" style="s2">delirious I can remember the delirium</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.119" end="00:20:44.440" style="s2">that lasted a whole day consisted of a</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.489" end="00:20:47.080" style="s2">sort of dreamlike hallucination that I</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.440" end="00:20:51.299" style="s2">had been kidnapped by you were you were</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.080" end="00:20:55.590" style="s2">delirious for nine days nine days yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.299" end="00:20:57.970" style="s2">nine days you remember the last last day</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.590" end="00:20:58.720" style="s2">yeah I remember that I was kidnapped by</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.970" end="00:21:00.999" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.720" end="00:21:04.269" style="s2">oddly enough who lived in Florida and</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.999" end="00:21:06.309" style="s2">they were like very rural backwoods</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.269" end="00:21:08.230" style="s2">people landlord a tree people root</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.309" end="00:21:10.179" style="s2">Florida tree people yeah and that they</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.230" end="00:21:12.399" style="s2">were gonna keep the leader of this</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.179" end="00:21:14.889" style="s2">little gang who kidnapped me we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.399" end="00:21:17.350" style="s2">kill me because the leader was going to</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.889" end="00:21:21.600" style="s2">kill me because he wanted to impress his</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.350" end="00:21:24.309" style="s2">girlfriend and it was a very very vivid</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.600" end="00:21:25.659" style="s2">dream that I had while I was awake I</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.309" end="00:21:28.779" style="s2">knew I was in the hospital at the same</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.659" end="00:21:30.909" style="s2">time I was just one of them and I also</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.779" end="00:21:36.840" style="s2">remember that when I first woke up I was</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.909" end="00:21:36.840" style="s2">irate because I had been</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.789" end="00:21:41.720" style="s2">being secured to the side of the bed</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.379" end="00:21:46.460" style="s2">because apparently I was tearing out the</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.720" end="00:21:47.929" style="s2">IV tubes that I was connected to because</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.460" end="00:21:50.269" style="s2">I didn&#39;t want to be in the hospital I</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.929" end="00:21:52.639" style="s2">had no idea why I was in the hospital or</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.269" end="00:21:58.119" style="s2">where the hospital was or where anybody</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.639" end="00:22:01.399" style="s2">I knew was we had to back up a bit again</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.119" end="00:22:03.289" style="s2">we had agreed when you were in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.399" end="00:22:04.879" style="s2">hospital in Toronto like our whole</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.289" end="00:22:07.249" style="s2">family had sat down and agreed that the</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.879" end="00:22:09.619" style="s2">best option was this rapid detox in</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.249" end="00:22:13.159" style="s2">Moscow and you&#39;d been part of that</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.619" end="00:22:16.489" style="s2">discussion but when you woke up after</p>

<p begin="00:22:16.489" end="00:22:21.769" style="s2">remember any of that right I remember</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.200" end="00:22:23.960" style="s2">being really angry with you when you</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.769" end="00:22:26.690" style="s2">first showed up because they were very</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.960" end="00:22:29.720" style="s2">limited yes but I didn&#39;t know that it</p>

<p begin="00:23:16.470" end="00:23:20.370" style="s2">dad to Moscow and destroyed him well</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.020" end="00:23:24.770" style="s2">that&#39;s what the doctor told you wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.370" end="00:23:27.120" style="s2">it the first said that oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.770" end="00:23:30.210" style="s2">under I couldn&#39;t even like there was one</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.120" end="00:23:33.659" style="s2">day that was so bad I couldn&#39;t go in and</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.210" end="00:23:36.929" style="s2">Andre went in and they said you know why</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.659" end="00:23:40.770" style="s2">are you here of all places in Russian</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.929" end="00:23:43.230" style="s2">and Andre said there was no one to help</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.770" end="00:23:45.720" style="s2">him in the West which there wasn&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.230" end="00:23:47.450" style="s2">looked everywhere right and we tried to</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.720" end="00:23:49.620" style="s2">clinics and talked to multiple</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.450" end="00:23:52.980" style="s2">psychiatrists and none of them could</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.620" end="00:23:55.640" style="s2">help and she said great you&#39;ve brought</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.980" end="00:23:55.640" style="s2">him here to die</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.660" end="00:24:00.760" style="s2">so and that was you know the scary thing</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.080" end="00:24:03.370" style="s2">about the hospital you were in in</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.760" end="00:24:06.160" style="s2">Toronto is you had pneumonia that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.370" end="00:24:08.050" style="s2">picked up until we got to Moscow so when</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.160" end="00:24:12.190" style="s2">you arrived in Moscow you had a fever</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.050" end="00:24:15.190" style="s2">and pneumonia in both lungs and so when</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.190" end="00:24:17.020" style="s2">they sedated you I the end to intubated</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.190" end="00:24:20.320" style="s2">means we had to intubate you during the</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.020" end="00:24:21.970" style="s2">sedation because of the pneumonia so we</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.320" end="00:24:24.280" style="s2">weren&#39;t getting care anywhere and</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.970" end="00:24:27.570" style="s2">getting off of benzodiazepines almost</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.280" end="00:24:27.570" style="s2">killed you on the place in Russia</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.840" end="00:24:33.150" style="s2">managed to stabilize you what it was</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.130" end="00:24:36.280" style="s2">yeah to some degree like I didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.150" end="00:24:39.070" style="s2">easier was much reduced yeah when the</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.280" end="00:24:41.230" style="s2">benzos were finally so they um they did</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.070" end="00:24:42.970" style="s2">some plasmapheresis as well to get rid</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.230" end="00:24:45.400" style="s2">of the benzodiazepines in your blood</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.970" end="00:24:47.140" style="s2">because the half-life of benzos are so</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.400" end="00:24:49.090" style="s2">long that even when you stop taking</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.140" end="00:24:50.830" style="s2">little dates of that particular kind you</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.090" end="00:24:53.110" style="s2">get early it takes a really long time</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.830" end="00:24:54.430" style="s2">for it to get out of your blood so one</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.110" end="00:24:56.950" style="s2">of the things they did when you were</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.430" end="00:24:59.320" style="s2">under was plasma frees us to get rid of</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.950" end="00:25:01.510" style="s2">all the benzodiazepines so when you woke</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.320" end="00:25:04.330" style="s2">up the only good thing that had happened</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.510" end="00:25:07.180" style="s2">was you weren&#39;t taking benzodiazepines</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.330" end="00:25:09.850" style="s2">and you weren&#39;t a Cathie&#39;s &#39;ok we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.180" end="00:25:11.590" style="s2">totally screwed but you weren&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.850" end="00:25:14.290" style="s2">Cathie&#39;s right yes and that that was a</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.590" end="00:25:16.060" style="s2">great relief and then we went when we</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.290" end="00:25:19.350" style="s2">went to rehab center for a while in</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.060" end="00:25:22.600" style="s2">moscow that was less medical and more</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.350" end="00:25:25.360" style="s2">physiotherapy yeah oriented and for a</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.600" end="00:25:26.800" style="s2">while I couldn&#39;t I couldn&#39;t type because</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.360" end="00:25:29.050" style="s2">I couldn&#39;t remember how to put my hands</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.800" end="00:25:30.340" style="s2">on the keyboard I couldn&#39;t walk up and</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.050" end="00:25:33.220" style="s2">down stairs because I couldn&#39;t see the</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.340" end="00:25:36.970" style="s2">stairs properly I couldn&#39;t do up buttons</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.220" end="00:25:39.490" style="s2">and one night I got up to use the</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.970" end="00:25:40.780" style="s2">washroom and then came back into the my</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.490" end="00:25:43.870" style="s2">bedroom and I couldn&#39;t remember how to</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.780" end="00:25:45.490" style="s2">lay down I tried for about 40 minutes I</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.870" end="00:25:47.590" style="s2">couldn&#39;t remember the sequence of</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.490" end="00:25:49.330" style="s2">actions that would enable me to lay down</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.590" end="00:25:52.480" style="s2">so this was probably two or three in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.330" end="00:25:55.630" style="s2">morning I ended up calling for a nurse</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.480" end="00:25:58.150" style="s2">so that the nurse who was a very helpful</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.630" end="00:26:00.190" style="s2">person could come in and tell me how to</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.150" end="00:26:02.590" style="s2">lay down so that was very strange kind</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.190" end="00:26:05.590" style="s2">of cortical blindness so I stayed in</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.590" end="00:26:07.090" style="s2">there for what two weeks and then we</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.590" end="00:26:08.730" style="s2">went to Florida where we thought it</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.090" end="00:26:11.429" style="s2">would be sunny and</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.730" end="00:26:15.390" style="s2">easier to recover which might have been</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.429" end="00:26:18.480" style="s2">but when I was in Florida the aunt my</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.390" end="00:26:20.130" style="s2">anxiety levels were I wasn&#39;t a Cathie&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.480" end="00:26:22.850" style="s2">ik most of the time but my anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.130" end="00:26:25.700" style="s2">levels were</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.850" end="00:26:29.210" style="s2">unbearably high and net that finally got</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.700" end="00:26:30.740" style="s2">so bad that I had family members there</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.210" end="00:26:32.660" style="s2">who were taking care of me you were</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.740" end="00:26:35.930" style="s2">there of course and Andre but also my</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.660" end="00:26:38.480" style="s2">parents my sister some friends Tammy</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.930" end="00:26:41.210" style="s2">came for a wild my son came for a while</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.480" end="00:26:44.900" style="s2">but it got to the point where it was</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.210" end="00:26:47.350" style="s2">obvious that just the care of family</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.900" end="00:26:51.050" style="s2">members no matter how well-intentioned a</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.350" end="00:26:53.890" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be sufficient and Bea was just</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.050" end="00:26:56.840" style="s2">too much to ask of people the</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.890" end="00:26:59.150" style="s2">responsibility was too great and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.840" end="00:27:01.430" style="s2">that&#39;s when we you at you and Andre had</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.150" end="00:27:03.230" style="s2">been communicating with the Serbian</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.430" end="00:27:04.730" style="s2">medical clinic for about six weeks</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.230" end="00:27:05.630" style="s2">something like that and they&#39;d been</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.730" end="00:27:08.360" style="s2">quite helpful</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.630" end="00:27:09.890" style="s2">five months okay well this is partly why</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.360" end="00:27:12.500" style="s2">we&#39;re doing this together is because I</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.890" end="00:27:14.900" style="s2">don&#39;t know all the facts at at hand yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.500" end="00:27:18.160" style="s2">but they were helpful they were helpful</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.900" end="00:27:20.240" style="s2">we Andre managed to get in touch with</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.160" end="00:27:23.600" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.240" end="00:27:25.670" style="s2">when it can Belgrade where it&#39;s not at</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.600" end="00:27:27.770" style="s2">least people who are treating you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.670" end="00:27:31.760" style="s2">not run by a psychiatrist it&#39;s run by an</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.770" end="00:27:33.860" style="s2">anesthesiologist which seems to be how</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.760" end="00:27:36.650" style="s2">you need to be treated well it&#39;s working</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.860" end="00:27:37.220" style="s2">for it seems to be working for me at the</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.650" end="00:27:38.900" style="s2">present</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.220" end="00:27:41.090" style="s2">anyways and that&#39;s the best we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.900" end="00:27:45.620" style="s2">and it&#39;s pretty good because I felt</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.090" end="00:27:47.300" style="s2">better probably I felt better see the</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.620" end="00:27:49.960" style="s2">things about the benzodiazepines too</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.300" end="00:27:56.809" style="s2">that I didn&#39;t really understand until I</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.960" end="00:27:58.850" style="s2">began to decrease their use I was very I</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.809" end="00:28:00.590" style="s2">beat had become quite isolated from my</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.850" end="00:28:02.000" style="s2">family members yeah right it was not</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.590" end="00:28:04.460" style="s2">most noticeable I would say in my</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.000" end="00:28:06.559" style="s2">relationship with my son but it was like</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.460" end="00:28:08.900" style="s2">there was a barrier up between million</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.559" end="00:28:11.120" style="s2">people it was noticeable it was</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.900" end="00:28:13.970" style="s2">noticeable I thought I thought</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.120" end="00:28:15.920" style="s2">attributed that to strange twists and</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.970" end="00:28:17.780" style="s2">turns my life had taken in the previous</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.920" end="00:28:20.000" style="s2">two or three years because there was no</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.780" end="00:28:22.100" style="s2">shortage of strangeness on that front</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.000" end="00:28:24.320" style="s2">but and then also I had two strange</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.100" end="00:28:26.960" style="s2">muscle weakness that plagued me and I</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.320" end="00:28:29.320" style="s2">now realize in retrospect that that was</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.960" end="00:28:34.340" style="s2">all a consequence of benzodiazepine use</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.320" end="00:28:37.220" style="s2">so using him well this is part of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.340" end="00:28:39.470" style="s2">reason we&#39;re doing this this podcaster</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.220" end="00:28:42.740" style="s2">video is well to let people know these</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.470" end="00:28:45.440" style="s2">are very widely prescribed drugs and</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.740" end="00:28:47.809" style="s2">they are not safe to take for more than</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.440" end="00:28:49.429" style="s2">two weeks or a month at the absolute</p>

<p begin="00:28:49.429" end="00:28:53.720" style="s2">that and you end up addicted you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.590" end="00:28:55.550" style="s2">gonna or dependent which means that</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.720" end="00:28:57.470" style="s2">you&#39;ll suffer withdrawal symptoms on</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.550" end="00:29:00.080" style="s2">their cessation you are gonna be one</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.470" end="00:29:02.450" style="s2">sorry person some people you know have a</p>

<p begin="00:29:04.730" end="00:29:10.700" style="s2">terrible time so that it&#39;s an absolute</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.150" end="00:29:12.590" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a medically-induced epidemic</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.700" end="00:29:14.450" style="s2">it&#39;s a complete bloody catastrophe here</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.590" end="00:29:15.950" style="s2">it&#39;s probably worse than the opiate</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.450" end="00:29:18.590" style="s2">epidemic and that&#39;s really saying</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.950" end="00:29:21.260" style="s2">something so and I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m out</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.590" end="00:29:23.090" style="s2">of it or not you know I mean I&#39;m I have</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.260" end="00:29:25.610" style="s2">a hard time believing how much better I</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.090" end="00:29:29.870" style="s2">feel that I did two weeks ago it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.610" end="00:29:31.790" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t seem plausible so you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.870" end="00:29:34.160" style="s2">it&#39;s possible all the things will just</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.790" end="00:29:37.190" style="s2">deteriorate for me again although</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.160" end="00:29:41.330" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t I don&#39;t feel like that at the</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.190" end="00:29:44.170" style="s2">moment I feel like things are put back</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.330" end="00:29:46.940" style="s2">together in an important way</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.170" end="00:29:48.530" style="s2">fortunately one thing I&#39;ve been able to</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.940" end="00:29:51.380" style="s2">continue doing through all of this as</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.530" end="00:29:53.060" style="s2">I&#39;m writing a new book and it&#39;s due in</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.380" end="00:29:54.560" style="s2">the middle of July and that&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.060" end="00:29:57.770" style="s2">quite well and I was able to do that</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.560" end="00:29:59.270" style="s2">even when I was in these different</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.770" end="00:30:01.580" style="s2">clinics hospitalized in all these</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.270" end="00:30:06.860" style="s2">different clinics although I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.580" end="00:30:09.530" style="s2">I did any writing in Russia no not till</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.860" end="00:30:11.270" style="s2">the very end yeah at the very end you</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.530" end="00:30:14.570" style="s2">did before we went to Florida yep you</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.270" end="00:30:16.640" style="s2">were editing yeah well I remembered one</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.570" end="00:30:20.090" style="s2">other thing we were gonna discuss you</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.640" end="00:30:21.770" style="s2">know some people okay first of all I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.090" end="00:30:25.630" style="s2">had a tremendous amount of support from</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.770" end="00:30:27.530" style="s2">family members and friends like really I</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.630" end="00:30:30.160" style="s2">mentioned this earlier but it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.530" end="00:30:34.220" style="s2">mentioning again people have gone far</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.160" end="00:30:37.490" style="s2">beyond the call of duty to help me and</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.220" end="00:30:41.690" style="s2">Tami and I in the last year and a half</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.490" end="00:30:43.940" style="s2">and there&#39;s been an unbelievably massive</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.690" end="00:30:47.060" style="s2">outpouring of public support which has</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.940" end="00:30:49.850" style="s2">really taken me by surprise in some</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.060" end="00:30:54.560" style="s2">sense because you know it&#39;s one thing to</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.850" end="00:30:57.710" style="s2">be to express your condolences if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.560" end="00:31:00.260" style="s2">discussing someone who like my wife is</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.710" end="00:31:02.840" style="s2">suffering from something clearly of her</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.260" end="00:31:07.490" style="s2">know of that&#39;s clearly not of her making</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.840" end="00:31:10.610" style="s2">cancer for example but a dependence is</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.490" end="00:31:12.740" style="s2">more ethically questionable right</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.610" end="00:31:15.470" style="s2">because you think well everyone thinks</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.740" end="00:31:17.360" style="s2">well you know what did the person the</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.470" end="00:31:19.960" style="s2">person obviously made some errors in</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.360" end="00:31:22.750" style="s2">choice that contributed to this and</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.960" end="00:31:26.260" style="s2">that&#39;s a reasonable objection but and</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.750" end="00:31:26.260" style="s2">despite the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.580" end="00:31:32.470" style="s2">there are many people who</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.429" end="00:31:35.169" style="s2">found that their opinions didn&#39;t align</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.470" end="00:31:37.029" style="s2">with mine let&#39;s say the proportion of</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.169" end="00:31:39.129" style="s2">negative comments I got about what I was</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.029" end="00:31:41.970" style="s2">going through was very small so that was</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.129" end="00:31:41.970" style="s2">really something</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.690" end="00:31:47.930" style="s2">but nonetheless</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.040" end="00:31:52.520" style="s2">one of the things I wanted to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.930" end="00:31:54.200" style="s2">you about today was the fact that what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.520" end="00:31:56.570" style="s2">the old saying physician heal thyself</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.200" end="00:31:58.460" style="s2">right I wrote a self-help book I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.570" end="00:32:01.490" style="s2">psychologist it&#39;s like well why the hell</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.460" end="00:32:03.820" style="s2">didn&#39;t I see this coming and why wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.490" end="00:32:05.870" style="s2">I more cautious and I think those are a</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.820" end="00:32:07.640" style="s2">reasonable question why should people</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.870" end="00:32:09.980" style="s2">take it well then that&#39;s the next</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.640" end="00:32:13.130" style="s2">question is why should people take</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.980" end="00:32:17.390" style="s2">anything I say seriously because of that</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.130" end="00:32:20.060" style="s2">and I guess what I would say is if</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.390" end="00:32:23.480" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna wait to learn from people</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.060" end="00:32:25.850" style="s2">who don&#39;t mistake don&#39;t make mistakes or</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.480" end="00:32:27.590" style="s2">don&#39;t have tragedy into their life</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.850" end="00:32:30.260" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna spend a long time waiting</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.590" end="00:32:33.950" style="s2">to learn something and the second thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.260" end="00:32:34.580" style="s2">I would say is in my lectures and my</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.950" end="00:32:38.870" style="s2">writings</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.580" end="00:32:40.910" style="s2">I&#39;ve never suggested that I was anything</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.870" end="00:32:42.920" style="s2">other than one of the people who also</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.910" end="00:32:46.330" style="s2">needed to learn this lesson these</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.920" end="00:32:48.590" style="s2">lessons so I included myself in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.330" end="00:32:51.820" style="s2">population of people who needed some</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.590" end="00:32:51.820" style="s2">moral improvement and</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.950" end="00:32:59.390" style="s2">and then the last thing would be</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.450" end="00:33:00.980" style="s2">you you have to make that the decision</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.390" end="00:33:02.900" style="s2">about whether or not to attend to</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.980" end="00:33:06.440" style="s2">anything that I&#39;m doing based on your</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.900" end="00:33:08.690" style="s2">own judgement about what I&#39;ve done and</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.440" end="00:33:11.630" style="s2">said and if you find that that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.690" end="00:33:13.930" style="s2">convincing then that&#39;s your prerogative</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.630" end="00:33:17.000" style="s2">than if you find that it&#39;s useful then</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.930" end="00:33:19.700" style="s2">well I&#39;m delighted by that obviously and</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.000" end="00:33:22.940" style="s2">that&#39;s that that&#39;s as that&#39;s as much as</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.700" end="00:33:26.630" style="s2">there is to say well I think one of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.940" end="00:33:30.410" style="s2">points of doing this podcast was to</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.630" end="00:33:31.850" style="s2">inform people so that other people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.410" end="00:33:33.740" style="s2">have to go through the same thing you</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.850" end="00:33:34.640" style="s2">went through because watching it from</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.740" end="00:33:38.800" style="s2">the outside</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.640" end="00:33:38.800" style="s2">was the worst thing I&#39;ve ever seen</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.640" end="00:33:43.230" style="s2">definitely and</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.410" end="00:33:48.460" style="s2">hopefully educating people on the</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.240" end="00:33:50.050" style="s2">dangers of this well that&#39;s saying</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.460" end="00:33:52.390" style="s2">something cuz when you awake when they</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.050" end="00:33:56.110" style="s2">replaced your ankle last year in January</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.390" end="00:33:59.470" style="s2">oh yeah but that was like there was</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.110" end="00:34:01.270" style="s2">still an element of yes I was awake when</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.470" end="00:34:02.650" style="s2">they replaced my ankle because I was</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.270" end="00:34:04.090" style="s2">trying to avoid the general anesthesia</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.650" end="00:34:06.700" style="s2">because I didn&#39;t want the general</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.090" end="00:34:09.040" style="s2">anesthesia hangover I should have just</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.700" end="00:34:10.540" style="s2">done the general anesthesia which is</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.040" end="00:34:12.820" style="s2">something I realized when they were</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.540" end="00:34:16.270" style="s2">hammering my ankle but yeah watching you</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.820" end="00:34:20.140" style="s2">in how long you&#39;ve been in pain has been</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.270" end="00:34:21.970" style="s2">significantly worse and I did want to</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.140" end="00:34:24.490" style="s2">mention too because people are going to</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.970" end="00:34:26.320" style="s2">be wondering why didn&#39;t you again why</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.490" end="00:34:30.160" style="s2">you didn&#39;t get more help in North</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.320" end="00:34:32.200" style="s2">America and one of the reasons was oh we</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.160" end="00:34:34.300" style="s2">went to Russia we successfully got dad</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.200" end="00:34:36.820" style="s2">off with benzos which to clinics in</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.300" end="00:34:37.810" style="s2">North America hadn&#39;t been able to do we</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.820" end="00:34:41.410" style="s2">did manage to do that</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.810" end="00:34:43.020" style="s2">and the damage that the benzos had</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.410" end="00:34:47.429" style="s2">caused</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.020" end="00:34:49.320" style="s2">and the detox caused was significant but</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.429" end="00:34:51.030" style="s2">there wasn&#39;t any akathisia so they</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.320" end="00:34:53.610" style="s2">brought you back to Florida because we</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.030" end="00:34:55.919" style="s2">thought there&#39;s no point in leaving you</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.610" end="00:34:57.750" style="s2">in a center somewhere right you can come</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.919" end="00:35:00.510" style="s2">back you can stay with family and we can</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.750" end="00:35:02.490" style="s2">just wait and maybe it&#39;s gonna take two</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.510" end="00:35:04.410" style="s2">two years it looked like it was gonna</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.490" end="00:35:06.540" style="s2">take a really long time if you were ever</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.410" end="00:35:07.920" style="s2">going to recover Foley we thought we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.540" end="00:35:10.920" style="s2">just it&#39;ll be more comfortable in</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.920" end="00:35:14.370" style="s2">somewhere like Florida and we waited and</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.920" end="00:35:17.760" style="s2">it probably was yeah well Moscow winter</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.370" end="00:35:20.580" style="s2">was a little anxiety provoking other</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.760" end="00:35:21.870" style="s2">than the medical experience you were</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.580" end="00:35:25.230" style="s2">going through it was a little anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.870" end="00:35:29.520" style="s2">provoking so there was Florida and then</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.230" end="00:35:32.010" style="s2">the pandemic hit so we didn&#39;t we weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.520" end="00:35:35.790" style="s2">really able to go anywhere and Andre and</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.010" end="00:35:39.720" style="s2">I spent months looking for a place that</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.790" end="00:35:41.630" style="s2">would take you and actually treat the</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.720" end="00:35:44.550" style="s2">neurological damage done by the</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.630" end="00:35:47.550" style="s2">benzodiazepines because this wasn&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.550" end="00:35:49.740" style="s2">I was when I was 17 and had my ankle and</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.550" end="00:35:52.140" style="s2">hip done I took oxycontin a high-level</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.740" end="00:35:54.150" style="s2">high dose of oxycontin for a year and</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.140" end="00:35:57.000" style="s2">getting off of that I experienced</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.150" end="00:35:59.550" style="s2">physical withdrawal no psychological</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.000" end="00:36:01.160" style="s2">withdrawal so I&#39;m like lots of people</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.550" end="00:36:04.590" style="s2">aren&#39;t aware of the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.160" end="00:36:06.060" style="s2">psychological and physical abuse the</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.590" end="00:36:09.480" style="s2">difference between abuse and dependence</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.060" end="00:36:12.030" style="s2">yeah and physical withdrawals means your</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.480" end="00:36:13.680" style="s2">body gets used to the drug that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.030" end="00:36:14.910" style="s2">on and when you take it away it&#39;s as if</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.680" end="00:36:20.700" style="s2">your body is missing something</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.910" end="00:36:23.280" style="s2">yeah so with yeah so it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.700" end="00:36:25.080" style="s2">difficult to find it&#39;s nearly impossible</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.280" end="00:36:27.890" style="s2">to find physicians that know how to</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.080" end="00:36:31.170" style="s2">treat neurological damage done by</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.890" end="00:36:33.000" style="s2">benzodiazepines it turns out we couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.170" end="00:36:35.250" style="s2">find anyone in North America and we</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.000" end="00:36:37.560" style="s2">contacted places because being treated</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.250" end="00:36:40.020" style="s2">in North America is would be easier than</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.560" end="00:36:43.650" style="s2">being treated in somewhere that the main</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.020" end="00:36:47.130" style="s2">language isn&#39;t English right and so it</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.650" end="00:36:49.920" style="s2">took us five months of negotiations to</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.130" end="00:36:51.840" style="s2">find the clinic in Belgrade where there</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.920" end="00:36:55.710" style="s2">was an anesthesiologist who could treat</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.840" end="00:36:57.500" style="s2">you and thank God that he apparently</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.710" end="00:37:00.680" style="s2">knows what he&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.500" end="00:37:03.560" style="s2">and then we got here two days after we</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.680" end="00:37:07.040" style="s2">were Serbia opened so we weren&#39;t waiting</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.560" end="00:37:08.150" style="s2">around like twiddling our thumbs trying</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.040" end="00:37:09.800" style="s2">to figure out what to do with you we</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.150" end="00:37:11.780" style="s2">were actively looking for physicians</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.800" end="00:37:13.400" style="s2">that could help you but there weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.780" end="00:37:16.520" style="s2">any and we were absolutely terrified</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.400" end="00:37:19.340" style="s2">that we&#39;d bring you to a psychiatrist in</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.520" end="00:37:22.400" style="s2">North America or a center there and</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.340" end="00:37:26.390" style="s2">they&#39;d say his anxiety is through the</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.400" end="00:37:30.619" style="s2">roof put him on benzos right and then</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.390" end="00:37:32.420" style="s2">that would have been terrible so</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.619" end="00:37:35.329" style="s2">we did look everywhere and it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.420" end="00:37:39.170" style="s2">very complicated yes that&#39;s for sure and</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.329" end="00:37:41.869" style="s2">it&#39;s been very complicated and so you</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.170" end="00:37:43.400" style="s2">know maybe we&#39;ve well we&#39;re confident</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.869" end="00:37:45.200" style="s2">enough that we&#39;ve come out the other</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.400" end="00:37:49.599" style="s2">side of it at least to some degree that</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.200" end="00:37:53.930" style="s2">we were willing to risk making this</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.599" end="00:37:55.759" style="s2">interview this video so yeah you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.930" end="00:38:00.400" style="s2">the reason we&#39;re doing it apart from</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.759" end="00:38:02.089" style="s2">telling people that they should be</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.400" end="00:38:04.309" style="s2">exceptionally careful with</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.089" end="00:38:06.650" style="s2">benzodiazepine prescriptions and like a</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.309" end="00:38:08.509" style="s2">very large number of elderly people are</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.650" end="00:38:13.009" style="s2">prescribed benzodiazepines most of them</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.509" end="00:38:15.200" style="s2">women but plenty of men - and that&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.009" end="00:38:17.569" style="s2">do that at your peril it also increases</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.200" end="00:38:21.549" style="s2">the risk of dementia quite substantially</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.569" end="00:38:26.980" style="s2">so that&#39;s a lovely additional benefit so</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.549" end="00:38:26.980" style="s2">watch it it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.579" end="00:38:32.650" style="s2">how strophe that benzodiazepines are</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.309" end="00:38:35.259" style="s2">being prescribed the way they are so</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.650" end="00:38:41.589" style="s2">broadly and so there&#39;s that but then</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.259" end="00:38:46.319" style="s2">also we felt that because I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.589" end="00:38:49.779" style="s2">how he&#39;d say it because people have been</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.319" end="00:38:52.869" style="s2">party to my certain elements of my</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.779" end="00:38:58.209" style="s2">private life and me too there&#39;s perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.869" end="00:39:02.079" style="s2">that it was morally obligatory to bring</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.209" end="00:39:06.910" style="s2">people who were interested up to date on</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.079" end="00:39:08.529" style="s2">what&#39;s occurred so so far so good you</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.910" end="00:39:10.660" style="s2">know it&#39;s been nice to see you and Andre</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.529" end="00:39:15.099" style="s2">get a break for at least a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.660" end="00:39:18.989" style="s2">weeks and it&#39;s been really nice not to</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.099" end="00:39:18.989" style="s2">be terrified out of my mind for</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.190" end="00:39:25.940" style="s2">I mean in Florida the best I ever got</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.200" end="00:39:28.130" style="s2">was not petrified with anxiety but close</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.940" end="00:39:30.560" style="s2">to it</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.130" end="00:39:34.570" style="s2">yeah I had that for a few days in a row</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.560" end="00:39:34.570" style="s2">a couple of times but here</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.869" end="00:39:40.869" style="s2">and has a tremor my left hand yeah one</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.630" end="00:39:43.670" style="s2">of the things with benzodiazepine</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.869" end="00:39:45.769" style="s2">dependence is it increases your seizure</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.670" end="00:39:47.329" style="s2">risk after you stop taking them so this</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.769" end="00:39:49.609" style="s2">is how serious to give an example about</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.329" end="00:39:52.490" style="s2">how serious this physical dependency can</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.609" end="00:39:54.980" style="s2">be is for some people even on a low dose</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.490" end="00:39:57.319" style="s2">of benzodiazepines if they become</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.980" end="00:40:00.559" style="s2">dependent on it and stop they can have</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.319" end="00:40:03.440" style="s2">seizures that&#39;s how that&#39;s how intense</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.559" end="00:40:05.630" style="s2">the brain changes can be so you on each</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.440" end="00:40:06.069" style="s2">caesar increases the risk of the next</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.630" end="00:40:09.529" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.069" end="00:40:12.730" style="s2">you&#39;ve been at a seizure risk for six</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.529" end="00:40:17.359" style="s2">months you&#39;re still if you&#39;re not on</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.730" end="00:40:18.589" style="s2">anticonvulsants so then you have tremors</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.359" end="00:40:20.480" style="s2">everywhere and you&#39;re a seizure risk</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.589" end="00:40:23.599" style="s2">that&#39;s ridiculous for six months after</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.480" end="00:40:25.369" style="s2">taking after stopping well that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.599" end="00:40:27.710" style="s2">because I completely thought it was</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.369" end="00:40:29.839" style="s2">interesting too because I was so</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.710" end="00:40:33.589" style="s2">appalled by what the benzodiazepines had</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.839" end="00:40:36.799" style="s2">done that well I I went from four</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.589" end="00:40:40.489" style="s2">milligrams a day to zero last May and</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.799" end="00:40:43.430" style="s2">that wasn&#39;t tolerable so I went back up</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.489" end="00:40:45.200" style="s2">north part of the reason you did that as</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.430" end="00:40:46.670" style="s2">people would be like why would you do</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.200" end="00:40:48.079" style="s2">that you&#39;re supposed to taper first of</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.670" end="00:40:49.849" style="s2">all if you don&#39;t know about</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.079" end="00:40:52.819" style="s2">benzodiazepines it&#39;s not obvious that</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.849" end="00:40:55.220" style="s2">you have to taper but we you have also</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.819" end="00:40:57.769" style="s2">went to a psychiatrist to deal with your</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.220" end="00:41:00.140" style="s2">worsening anxiety that you thought was</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.769" end="00:41:02.989" style="s2">mainly attributed to mom&#39;s cancer and</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.140" end="00:41:05.599" style="s2">his suggestion was triquet Amin and</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.989" end="00:41:07.460" style="s2">stopped the benzodiazepines so that was</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.599" end="00:41:09.940" style="s2">the first psychiatrist we tried yes</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.460" end="00:41:13.999" style="s2">right and we went to we saw at least</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.940" end="00:41:16.130" style="s2">five of them in different areas before</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.999" end="00:41:19.400" style="s2">we got to Russia so it&#39;s not like we</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.130" end="00:41:21.980" style="s2">didn&#39;t give North America a good try</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.400" end="00:41:23.809" style="s2">it&#39;s just you I mean you ended up you</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.980" end="00:41:28.329" style="s2">got worse and worse more psychiatrists</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.809" end="00:41:31.400" style="s2">they&#39;re generally insisted on doing was</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.329" end="00:41:33.739" style="s2">quote treating the underlying problem</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.400" end="00:41:35.690" style="s2">unquote when you when the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.739" end="00:41:38.150" style="s2">problem was benzodiazepine withdrawal</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.690" end="00:41:39.619" style="s2">not some other issue yeah they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.150" end="00:41:41.329" style="s2">know what to do with benzodiazepine</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.619" end="00:41:42.920" style="s2">withdrawal so they tried to treat</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.329" end="00:41:46.609" style="s2">something they didn&#39;t know what to do</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.920" end="00:41:49.120" style="s2">with that didn&#39;t exist yeah at least in</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.609" end="00:41:52.930" style="s2">all probability didn&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.120" end="00:41:54.970" style="s2">yes you got treated by you what you went</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.930" end="00:41:56.800" style="s2">to two different clinics and then</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.970" end="00:41:59.710" style="s2">multiple other psychiatrists and they</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.800" end="00:42:01.810" style="s2">try to treat your underlying problem yes</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.710" end="00:42:03.190" style="s2">which we had to have huge arguments</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.810" end="00:42:05.740" style="s2">about no this isn&#39;t an underlying</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.190" end="00:42:07.720" style="s2">there&#39;s no underlying problem this is a</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.740" end="00:42:09.400" style="s2">benzodiazepine dependency and we need to</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.720" end="00:42:11.710" style="s2">get him off of it but he can&#39;t tolerate</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.400" end="00:42:13.210" style="s2">it because the akathisia so how do you</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.710" end="00:42:16.450" style="s2">make him more comfortable while he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.210" end="00:42:18.640" style="s2">waiting down and there was they had no</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.450" end="00:42:20.710" style="s2">idea what to you that&#39;s right that&#39;s was</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.640" end="00:42:25.870" style="s2">something they&#39;ve been very good at this</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.710" end="00:42:27.370" style="s2">clinic yeah and advising you and me for</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.870" end="00:42:30.850" style="s2">that matter for the last few months</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.370" end="00:42:32.980" style="s2">while I&#39;ve been trying to yeah my head</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.850" end="00:42:35.560" style="s2">screwed on straight again yeah they</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.980" end="00:42:38.740" style="s2">tried helping us from afar but we needed</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.560" end="00:42:40.360" style="s2">more help than that um so I guess one of</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.740" end="00:42:43.680" style="s2">the things we&#39;ve learned from this is</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.360" end="00:42:46.720" style="s2">there may be ways to treat</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.680" end="00:42:49.990" style="s2">benzodiazepine withdrawal right that</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.720" end="00:42:50.680" style="s2">we&#39;re not aware of in North America that</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.990" end="00:42:53.800" style="s2">I&#39;m aware of</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.680" end="00:42:55.900" style="s2">yes there may be ways we&#39;ll talk about</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.800" end="00:42:58.960" style="s2">this again at some point in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.900" end="00:43:01.900" style="s2">relatively near future aspect when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.960" end="00:43:03.760" style="s2">more certain that what is happening to</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.900" end="00:43:06.190" style="s2">me now is working yeah it&#39;s only been</p>

<p begin="00:43:17.410" end="00:43:21.280" style="s2">it&#39;s a real relief to get my my love for</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.690" end="00:43:22.810" style="s2">music back and that&#39;s like a switch</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.280" end="00:43:26.110" style="s2">being turned on because it was gone</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.810" end="00:43:31.150" style="s2">completely and now it&#39;s back completely</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.110" end="00:43:34.600" style="s2">very very strange so yeah so well we</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.150" end="00:43:37.540" style="s2">will talk more about what&#39;s helped if we</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.600" end="00:43:39.880" style="s2">know that it&#39;s helped yes um then we</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.540" end="00:43:41.500" style="s2">could suggest to people what might be</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.880" end="00:43:43.030" style="s2">tried in the absence of any other</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.500" end="00:43:44.830" style="s2">options what they can talk to their</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.030" end="00:43:46.450" style="s2">doctor but I&#39;d like to reiterate you</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.830" end="00:43:49.260" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.450" end="00:43:52.930" style="s2">I don&#39;t remember what I think it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.260" end="00:43:55.660" style="s2">prescription either in seven or one</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.930" end="00:43:58.079" style="s2">prescription in nine in the United</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.660" end="00:44:01.690" style="s2">States is either for opiates or</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.079" end="00:44:03.520" style="s2">benzodiazepines so that&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.690" end="00:44:05.170" style="s2">obviously a huge proportion of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.520" end="00:44:09.089" style="s2">prescriptions and there&#39;s it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.170" end="00:44:12.310" style="s2">probable that someone in your family is</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.089" end="00:44:14.140" style="s2">currently taking benzodiazepine or or</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.310" end="00:44:17.170" style="s2">will be prescribed them in the future</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.140" end="00:44:19.690" style="s2">for long enough to develop a dependence</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.170" end="00:44:22.690" style="s2">it&#39;s like people need to know this it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.690" end="00:44:27.190" style="s2">not good those drugs are for short-term</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.690" end="00:44:30.430" style="s2">treatment of stress induced anxiety or</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.190" end="00:44:34.359" style="s2">for surgery they are used in surgery and</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.430" end="00:44:38.550" style="s2">things right yeah but as a long-term</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.359" end="00:44:42.310" style="s2">treatment there are complete catastrophe</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.550" end="00:44:44.020" style="s2">yeah and not everybody like you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.310" end="00:44:45.579" style="s2">they&#39;ll be the person or two that&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.020" end="00:44:46.690" style="s2">well I took them and I got off of you</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.579" end="00:44:50.320" style="s2">and that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.690" end="00:44:52.869" style="s2">but if you it seems if you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.320" end="00:44:54.490" style="s2">statistics if you&#39;re older then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.869" end="00:44:56.170" style="s2">harder you you&#39;re more likely to form a</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.490" end="00:44:57.790" style="s2">dependency right and maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.170" end="00:44:59.650" style="s2">because your brain isn&#39;t as plastic</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.790" end="00:45:01.900" style="s2">maybe it takes just longer to heal from</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.650" end="00:45:04.119" style="s2">them what&#39;s also true of opiates like</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.900" end="00:45:06.329" style="s2">not everybody who takes opiates for a</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.119" end="00:45:09.040" style="s2">long period of time develops a</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.329" end="00:45:11.410" style="s2">pronounced dependence there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.040" end="00:45:14.619" style="s2">individual variability but the risk is</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.410" end="00:45:16.660" style="s2">still extremely high mm-hmm I had people</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.619" end="00:45:18.700" style="s2">messaged me after the video and</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.660" end="00:45:21.700" style="s2">September is saying they&#39;d gotten off of</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.700" end="00:45:23.560" style="s2">multiple drugs and that benzodiazepines</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.700" end="00:45:25.720" style="s2">had been the most difficult by far</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.560" end="00:45:27.460" style="s2">mm-hmm people with experience with</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.720" end="00:45:30.099" style="s2">opiates as well or heroin or something</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.460" end="00:45:32.440" style="s2">said benzodiazepines wasn&#39;t completely</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.099" end="00:45:36.460" style="s2">doable I&#39;d had bouts of depression</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.440" end="00:45:38.890" style="s2">before before last fall let&#39;s say in my</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.460" end="00:45:42.670" style="s2">life and I would have to say those were</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.890" end="00:45:43.960" style="s2">among the most among the worst</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.670" end="00:45:47.530" style="s2">experiences of my life</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.960" end="00:45:49.359" style="s2">but I&#39;d have to say that after searching</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.530" end="00:45:51.940" style="s2">long and hard for something that was</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.359" end="00:45:54.630" style="s2">worse than depression I finally</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.940" end="00:45:58.019" style="s2">discovered it in our Cathie&#39;s iya</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.630" end="00:46:01.319" style="s2">his Depression was remember we talked</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.019" end="00:46:03.239" style="s2">about that right and because you had</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.319" end="00:46:08.390" style="s2">suffered boats of depression as well as</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.239" end="00:46:08.390" style="s2">the arthritis and one</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.500" end="00:46:14.870" style="s2">definition we&#39;d agreed on was that being</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.750" end="00:46:17.060" style="s2">depressed was like hearing that your dog</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.870" end="00:46:20.150" style="s2">had just died yeah remembering that</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.060" end="00:46:21.950" style="s2">continually and that&#39;s way yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.150" end="00:46:24.500" style="s2">thought that and there was a dog you</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.950" end="00:46:26.300" style="s2">actually like a lot you thought well</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.500" end="00:46:28.970" style="s2">that&#39;s bad but it&#39;s not nearly as bad as</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.300" end="00:46:30.170" style="s2">depression not even close right not even</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.970" end="00:46:32.150" style="s2">close I thought it was going to be as</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.170" end="00:46:35.030" style="s2">bad but then my dog died and I was like</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.150" end="00:46:36.680" style="s2">nah depression is way worse sucks the</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.030" end="00:46:39.140" style="s2">joy out of absolutely everything</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.680" end="00:46:41.630" style="s2">can&#39;t even see colors vividly like the</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.140" end="00:46:43.220" style="s2">joy out of seeing colors which you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.630" end="00:46:45.740" style="s2">even think there&#39;s joyous as I did with</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.220" end="00:46:48.110" style="s2">that but right cuz well with severe</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.740" end="00:46:51.230" style="s2">depression you lose positive emotion and</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.110" end="00:46:54.740" style="s2">gain a lot of negative emotion but with</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.230" end="00:46:56.900" style="s2">this akathisia it was like all of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.740" end="00:46:58.880" style="s2">negative emotion associated with</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.900" end="00:47:01.780" style="s2">depression plus a very high level of</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.880" end="00:47:06.110" style="s2">anxiety plus no positive emotion at all</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.780" end="00:47:10.300" style="s2">plus the inability to ever relax even</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.110" end="00:47:10.300" style="s2">for a moment and so it was</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.010" end="00:47:18.080" style="s2">yeah I wouldn&#39;t recommend it yes</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.970" end="00:47:18.080" style="s2">watch the hell out for</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.569" end="00:47:24.489" style="s2">they&#39;re probably not your friend or if</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.049" end="00:47:27.819" style="s2">they are they&#39;re not your friend for</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.489" end="00:47:31.419" style="s2">very long yeah and one of the weird</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.819" end="00:47:33.640" style="s2">things I was prescribed lorazepam for</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.419" end="00:47:35.140" style="s2">sleep I didn&#39;t take it very often</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.640" end="00:47:38.349" style="s2">because I found it didn&#39;t work very well</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.140" end="00:47:41.109" style="s2">thank goodness but the funny thing about</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.349" end="00:47:43.569" style="s2">them especially at a low dose is they</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.109" end="00:47:46.209" style="s2">don&#39;t or they didn&#39;t for me anyway</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.569" end="00:47:48.189" style="s2">induce any type of euphoria so when you</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.209" end="00:47:51.549" style="s2">take an opiate when I took the oxycontin</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.189" end="00:47:53.529" style="s2">I didn&#39;t like it but there was some sort</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.549" end="00:47:56.199" style="s2">of high that had to do with the pain</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.529" end="00:47:58.179" style="s2">medication but with the lore as a band</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.199" end="00:48:00.579" style="s2">there was just an absence of something</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.179" end="00:48:03.669" style="s2">so I think it&#39;s probably a sneakier drug</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.579" end="00:48:05.079" style="s2">to be on right because I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.669" end="00:48:08.130" style="s2">partly why I didn&#39;t notice what it was</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.079" end="00:48:11.679" style="s2">doing to me too is that there was no</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.130" end="00:48:15.749" style="s2">immediate effect in the day of taking it</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.679" end="00:48:20.549" style="s2">I mean I stopped having that terrible</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.749" end="00:48:20.549" style="s2">reaction that we attributed to food and</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.160" end="00:48:27.349" style="s2">so that eliminated the insomnia and the</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.440" end="00:48:30.140" style="s2">anxiety but there was no noticeable</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.349" end="00:48:31.970" style="s2">effect from the benzodiazepines and so I</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.140" end="00:48:34.579" style="s2">know just never paid any attention to</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.970" end="00:48:39.849" style="s2">them and never occurred to me that they</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.579" end="00:48:43.730" style="s2">could be causing me serious long-term</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.849" end="00:48:45.190" style="s2">damage you&#39;d also take and SSRIs for</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.730" end="00:48:49.369" style="s2">over a decade</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.190" end="00:48:52.789" style="s2">yes depressant anti-anxiety medication</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.369" end="00:48:54.920" style="s2">it turns out turns out those are not the</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.789" end="00:48:57.940" style="s2">same medications I even knew that to</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.920" end="00:49:00.829" style="s2">some degree because I knew that</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.940" end="00:49:03.020" style="s2">SSRIs the antidepressants were much more</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.829" end="00:49:06.319" style="s2">effective long-term treatments for panic</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.020" end="00:49:08.799" style="s2">disorder than benzodiazepines you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.319" end="00:49:08.799" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.810" end="00:49:14.960" style="s2">it&#39;s quite shocking to me actually that</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.820" end="00:49:18.890" style="s2">I didn&#39;t know despite my professional</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.960" end="00:49:21.769" style="s2">specialty that I had no idea how</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.890" end="00:49:23.960" style="s2">catastrophic benzodiazepine use could be</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.769" end="00:49:25.819" style="s2">yeah well psychologists don&#39;t aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.960" end="00:49:28.490" style="s2">psychiatrist psychiatrist prescribed</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.819" end="00:49:30.950" style="s2">medication psychologist counsel right</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.490" end="00:49:33.410" style="s2">but it&#39;s still useful to keep up on the</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.950" end="00:49:36.170" style="s2">relevant literature now you know yes</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.410" end="00:49:40.299" style="s2">well no I definitely I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.170" end="00:49:44.059" style="s2">forget that yes so you know it&#39;s funny</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.299" end="00:49:47.569" style="s2">maybe we&#39;ll stop with this once I</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.059" end="00:49:49.730" style="s2">started to decrease my use of</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.569" end="00:49:51.890" style="s2">benzodiazepines I was never tempted to</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.730" end="00:49:53.779" style="s2">go back up except right at the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.890" end="00:49:55.579" style="s2">when I went to zero and I had to well</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.779" end="00:49:56.329" style="s2">you were gonna have a seizure yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.579" end="00:49:58.220" style="s2">wasn&#39;t good</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.329" end="00:50:00.650" style="s2">you I couldn&#39;t even communicate with you</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.220" end="00:50:02.809" style="s2">but I thought after I got out of the</p>

<p begin="00:50:08.600" end="00:50:15.770" style="s2">like I think I really think that for me</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.350" end="00:50:18.170" style="s2">that it&#39;s no overstatement that to say</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.770" end="00:50:20.780" style="s2">that for me the consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.170" end="00:50:23.200" style="s2">benzodiazepine withdrawal were worse</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.780" end="00:50:26.320" style="s2">than death</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.200" end="00:50:29.170" style="s2">so yes that&#39;s what it looked like from</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.320" end="00:50:31.260" style="s2">the a yes well it it you know you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.170" end="00:50:35.710" style="s2">want to say something like that lightly</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.260" end="00:50:39.390" style="s2">you know but there were lots of times</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.710" end="00:50:39.390" style="s2">plenty of times when</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.660" end="00:50:44.640" style="s2">it would have been preferable as far as</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.299" end="00:50:46.740" style="s2">I could tell just not to be there than</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.640" end="00:50:49.500" style="s2">to experience what I was experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.740" end="00:50:51.480" style="s2">when you when you&#39;re in pain people who</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.500" end="00:50:54.930" style="s2">are in I mean being at a certain level</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.480" end="00:50:56.430" style="s2">of pain is like that right if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.930" end="00:50:59.339" style="s2">walking around you know anything over</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.430" end="00:51:03.089" style="s2">really like a seven or an eight you</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.339" end="00:51:05.220" style="s2">can&#39;t stand it yeah so that&#39;s what it</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.089" end="00:51:08.250" style="s2">looked like from the outside um well the</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.220" end="00:51:10.289" style="s2">other thing that that the benzodiazepine</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.250" end="00:51:13.880" style="s2">withdrawal did that was absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.289" end="00:51:17.190" style="s2">dreadful bus produce a sense of timing</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.880" end="00:51:21.270" style="s2">distortion so this was really obvious</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.190" end="00:51:23.220" style="s2">when I first woke up in Russia like the</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.270" end="00:51:25.700" style="s2">first day that you and I could speak</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.220" end="00:51:28.859" style="s2">again you were wheeling me around in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.700" end="00:51:31.440" style="s2">aisle of the corridor of the intensive</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.859" end="00:51:33.420" style="s2">care unit</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.440" end="00:51:34.560" style="s2">we were gonna wheel I was gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.420" end="00:51:39.000" style="s2">wheeled around until it was time for</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.560" end="00:51:41.100" style="s2">time to eat and I must have asked you</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.000" end="00:51:47.790" style="s2">how many times in ten minutes what time</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.100" end="00:51:49.320" style="s2">it was probably every 45 seconds yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.790" end="00:51:51.660" style="s2">probably something like that</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.320" end="00:51:54.720" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s because for me it felt</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.660" end="00:51:56.430" style="s2">like you know what substantial amount of</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.720" end="00:51:58.740" style="s2">time had passed an hour or two hours</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.430" end="00:52:02.190" style="s2">something like that some terrible amount</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.740" end="00:52:04.800" style="s2">of time and so not only was I in pain</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.190" end="00:52:08.840" style="s2">and experiencing extremely high levels</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.800" end="00:52:10.590" style="s2">of anxiety the duration of time had</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.840" end="00:52:12.330" style="s2">extended so that it was really</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.590" end="00:52:15.150" style="s2">unbearable it was like the days were</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.330" end="00:52:18.950" style="s2">just lasting forever and that&#39;s thank</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.150" end="00:52:18.950" style="s2">that actually disappeared quite a bit</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.060" end="00:52:23.890" style="s2">as the akathisia disappeared and it</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.280" end="00:52:26.779" style="s2">isn&#39;t the case now thank God but it was</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.890" end="00:52:29.209" style="s2">it was brutal</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.779" end="00:52:30.679" style="s2">it&#39;s funny even now you know because</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.209" end="00:52:31.489" style="s2">it&#39;s somewhat stressful to have this</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.679" end="00:52:34.189" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.489" end="00:52:35.989" style="s2">I can feel if I lift up my eyes my</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.189" end="00:52:37.819" style="s2">eyebrows a bit like you might when</p>
