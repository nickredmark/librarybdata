<p begin="00:00:00.740" end="00:00:08.750" style="s2">this video I wanted to talk about how we</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.870" end="00:00:11.610" style="s2">can have a peaceful voluntary revolution</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.750" end="00:00:13.920" style="s2">which is a bit of an oxymoron because</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.610" end="00:00:15.389" style="s2">the definition of a revolution is the</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.920" end="00:00:18.420" style="s2">forcible overthrowing of your government</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.389" end="00:00:20.490" style="s2">and I&#39;m in no way talking about that but</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.420" end="00:00:23.070" style="s2">there is no word for what I am talking</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.490" end="00:00:25.199" style="s2">about because that is what historically</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.070" end="00:00:27.990" style="s2">has been done in order to create a new</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.199" end="00:00:30.619" style="s2">system you have to dismantle the current</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.990" end="00:00:34.350" style="s2">one and that generally looks like</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.619" end="00:00:36.980" style="s2">violent revolution but what we can do</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.350" end="00:00:39.210" style="s2">together is create a parallel</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.980" end="00:00:43.170" style="s2">cooperative system that people can</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.210" end="00:00:46.110" style="s2">voluntarily opt into the analogy for</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.170" end="00:00:49.920" style="s2">this and how we compete the current</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.110" end="00:00:52.949" style="s2">system at competition how cooperation</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.920" end="00:00:55.199" style="s2">can out peak out compete competition the</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.949" end="00:00:58.050" style="s2">analogy for that is a tug of war game so</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.199" end="00:01:00.000" style="s2">tug of war you have one team competing</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.050" end="00:01:01.260" style="s2">on this side pulling the rope the other</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.000" end="00:01:03.239" style="s2">team compete on this side pulling the</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.260" end="00:01:05.129" style="s2">rope in this direction and whoever has</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.239" end="00:01:09.299" style="s2">the most combined strength is going to</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.129" end="00:01:12.180" style="s2">win time or game if on the competitive</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.299" end="00:01:14.040" style="s2">side you have everyone pulling in</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.180" end="00:01:17.040" style="s2">opposite directions everyone pulling in</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.040" end="00:01:20.280" style="s2">their own direction it&#39;s not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.040" end="00:01:22.110" style="s2">that hard for the unified side to pull</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.280" end="00:01:25.110" style="s2">it with any amount of strength in one</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.110" end="00:01:28.290" style="s2">unified direction and win this</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.110" end="00:01:33.479" style="s2">tug-of-war game throw them off balance</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.290" end="00:01:35.280" style="s2">and win the tug-of-war game how we do</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.479" end="00:01:38.159" style="s2">that is by looking for that unified</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.280" end="00:01:42.329" style="s2">direction allow them to be divided and</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.159" end="00:01:44.040" style="s2">find the unification so that means I</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.329" end="00:01:46.500" style="s2">don&#39;t get to dictate what anybody else</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.040" end="00:01:49.409" style="s2">is like life looks like I only get to</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.500" end="00:01:52.680" style="s2">meet you where you&#39;re at so I can find</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.409" end="00:01:55.710" style="s2">out what my best diet is and I can move</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.680" end="00:01:58.320" style="s2">towards it I can work on solutions that</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.710" end="00:02:00.479" style="s2">are going to bring down my true cost of</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.320" end="00:02:04.140" style="s2">food or keep my costs the same and</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.479" end="00:02:06.060" style="s2">improve my diet on my own terms it</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.140" end="00:02:10.410" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re keto or you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.060" end="00:02:12.510" style="s2">vegan or your whole thirty you get to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.410" end="00:02:13.710" style="s2">part of creating a solution that helps</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.510" end="00:02:16.290" style="s2">you eat better</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.710" end="00:02:18.440" style="s2">less and less resources your actual</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.290" end="00:02:21.690" style="s2">resources the world&#39;s actual resources</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.440" end="00:02:23.520" style="s2">we can combine forces to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.690" end="00:02:25.890" style="s2">understand what is currently out there</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.520" end="00:02:29.760" style="s2">without us need to recreate it reinvent</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.890" end="00:02:31.470" style="s2">anything just inventing the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.760" end="00:02:33.900" style="s2">helps us understand what is currently</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.470" end="00:02:36.390" style="s2">happening in food in energy in</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.900" end="00:02:38.640" style="s2">connection when a new idea comes out</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.390" end="00:02:40.170" style="s2">there how do we know that it&#39;s how it</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.640" end="00:02:41.970" style="s2">compares to what&#39;s already out there the</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.170" end="00:02:42.960" style="s2">current system is marketing which is</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.970" end="00:02:46.070" style="s2">pulling in every different direction</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.960" end="00:02:46.070" style="s2">we&#39;re the best</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.920" end="00:02:51.150" style="s2">they&#39;re not gonna what is the actual</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.110" end="00:02:54.180" style="s2">number one coffeehouse well depends what</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.150" end="00:02:56.550" style="s2">you mean by number one do you mean the</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.180" end="00:02:59.460" style="s2">darkest the lightest the most caffeine</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.550" end="00:03:01.080" style="s2">the hottest the freshest what is your</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.460" end="00:03:04.500" style="s2">definition I want all of the above I</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.080" end="00:03:07.650" style="s2">want the freshest medium roast ethical</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.500" end="00:03:09.480" style="s2">coffee that would be if I needed</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.650" end="00:03:11.760" style="s2">everyone to drink that that is not a</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.480" end="00:03:13.170" style="s2">unified direction if instead it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.760" end="00:03:14.880" style="s2">okay I want everyone to be able to have</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.170" end="00:03:16.950" style="s2">a cup of coffee and I want it to have</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.880" end="00:03:19.260" style="s2">the least impact on the planet on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.950" end="00:03:20.700" style="s2">people growing it I want to have the</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.260" end="00:03:23.850" style="s2">least impact negative way and the most</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.700" end="00:03:26.910" style="s2">impact in a positive way we can we can</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.850" end="00:03:29.730" style="s2">agree on what direction to pull that by</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.910" end="00:03:32.280" style="s2">looking at what unifies us instead of</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.730" end="00:03:36.180" style="s2">what divides us and then any amount of</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.280" end="00:03:37.860" style="s2">force in this direction wins and where</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.180" end="00:03:40.200" style="s2">this analogy falls apart in the most</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.860" end="00:03:42.660" style="s2">beautiful way is that you don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.200" end="00:03:44.850" style="s2">let go of your rope on the competitive</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.660" end="00:03:48.390" style="s2">side in order to join the cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.850" end="00:03:50.880" style="s2">side so you can be on this side pulling</p>
