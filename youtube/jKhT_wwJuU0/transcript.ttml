<p begin="00:18:49.899" end="00:19:01.119" style="s2">me so there is a sense in which the</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.519" end="00:19:02.740" style="s2">routing is a body scanning but one of</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.119" end="00:19:05.110" style="s2">the things that the routing and this</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.740" end="00:19:08.889" style="s2">comes out in the term routing emphasizes</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.110" end="00:19:11.950" style="s2">is it&#39;s not just a scanning process or a</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.889" end="00:19:14.559" style="s2">sensitization process it is also a deep</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.950" end="00:19:17.230" style="s2">stabilization process and this is why</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.559" end="00:19:19.749" style="s2">the downward movement and the releasing</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.230" end="00:19:22.559" style="s2">and draining and then the deep sense of</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.749" end="00:19:27.009" style="s2">connectedness and routing into the earth</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.559" end="00:19:30.669" style="s2">is an essential poem component one of</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.009" end="00:19:32.409" style="s2">the pitfalls I see maybe this is one of</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.669" end="00:19:33.879" style="s2">the pitfalls you didn&#39;t who you weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.409" end="00:19:35.200" style="s2">specific or what the pitfalls were but</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.879" end="00:19:38.259" style="s2">one of the pitfalls that people often</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.200" end="00:19:41.769" style="s2">get into but the bonney&#39;s scan is they</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.259" end="00:19:44.460" style="s2">get the sensitization but they also they</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.769" end="00:19:47.169" style="s2">get energized and things start racing</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.460" end="00:19:48.999" style="s2">because the the sense of groundedness</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.169" end="00:19:53.070" style="s2">and stability they become very sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.999" end="00:19:56.919" style="s2">ethereal and so it&#39;s very important to</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.070" end="00:19:58.570" style="s2">not just have the alertness of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.919" end="00:20:01.869" style="s2">warrior but also to have the deep</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.570" end="00:20:06.639" style="s2">stillness of the mountain and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.869" end="00:20:08.799" style="s2">the process culminates in the sinking</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.639" end="00:20:11.519" style="s2">into the earth the sensing the grounding</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.799" end="00:20:14.679" style="s2">the sense of how the supports and</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.519" end="00:20:17.440" style="s2">nourishes us reminding again the Buddha</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.679" end="00:20:19.360" style="s2">touching the earth when he&#39;s achieving</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.440" end="00:20:24.570" style="s2">enlightenment like that we are all</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.360" end="00:20:29.850" style="s2">deeply embodied and embedded so perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.570" end="00:20:31.630" style="s2">that&#39;s a particular pitfall you were</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.850" end="00:20:33.970" style="s2">mentioning</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.630" end="00:20:38.650" style="s2">another pitfall people often get with</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.970" end="00:20:42.310" style="s2">the body skin is they they are oriented</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.650" end="00:20:44.860" style="s2">to sort of picking up on sensations of</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.310" end="00:20:46.810" style="s2">relaxation if they&#39;re they focus on</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.860" end="00:20:51.310" style="s2">those and then that can lead to a deep</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.810" end="00:20:54.190" style="s2">kind of the kind of relaxation that is</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.310" end="00:21:00.360" style="s2">generally conducive to that sort of warm</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.190" end="00:21:03.240" style="s2">fuzziness that is often mistaken for the</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.360" end="00:21:05.980" style="s2">penetrating presence of mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.240" end="00:21:07.030" style="s2">that&#39;s why in the rooting exercise I</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.980" end="00:21:09.760" style="s2">taught you</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.030" end="00:21:12.730" style="s2">it was emphasized that you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.760" end="00:21:16.450" style="s2">let that area come to expression with</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.730" end="00:21:19.960" style="s2">whatever sensations are wanting or</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.450" end="00:21:21.490" style="s2">imminent and want to be become more</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.960" end="00:21:27.340" style="s2">explicit and articulated in your</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.490" end="00:21:29.140" style="s2">awareness and so that also shifts the</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.340" end="00:21:32.130" style="s2">orientation of people who sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.140" end="00:21:34.750" style="s2">enjoying their bodies and body scan</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.130" end="00:21:36.880" style="s2">we&#39;re in the routing is you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.750" end="00:21:39.900" style="s2">putting your awareness in service of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.880" end="00:21:43.120" style="s2">body allowing it to more dialogic ly</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.900" end="00:21:45.790" style="s2">connect and express and inform and</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.120" end="00:21:49.660" style="s2">potentially transform you so those are</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.790" end="00:21:54.760" style="s2">three differences entry and how it helps</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.660" end="00:21:57.460" style="s2">to address three kind of pitfalls I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.760" end="00:21:59.980" style="s2">encountered trying to pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.460" end="00:22:01.360" style="s2">getting lost and then delt donating if I</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.980" end="00:22:02.980" style="s2">can move on to the next step or booty</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.360" end="00:22:05.140" style="s2">also getting lost in thought and losing</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.980" end="00:22:06.820" style="s2">my place in the process yes so very much</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.140" end="00:22:09.430" style="s2">that&#39;s the first pitfall that I talked</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.820" end="00:22:11.920" style="s2">about so doing it in the sequence and</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.430" end="00:22:21.310" style="s2">and that this is very much a draining</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.920" end="00:22:23.350" style="s2">right and that you&#39;re not trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.310" end="00:22:25.090" style="s2">into some state of completeness that you</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.350" end="00:22:26.800" style="s2">if this area is completely relaxed</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.090" end="00:22:28.390" style="s2">completely released that&#39;s not what</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.800" end="00:22:30.310" style="s2">we&#39;re doing we&#39;re trying to get into</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.390" end="00:22:32.350" style="s2">right relationship not perfection and</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.310" end="00:22:34.150" style="s2">those are not the same thing and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.350" end="00:22:37.090" style="s2">again the emphasis on that this whole</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.150" end="00:22:40.840" style="s2">process is moving towards a culmination</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.090" end="00:22:43.690" style="s2">in roundedness connectedness service to</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.840" end="00:22:47.290" style="s2">the body letting it speak</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.690" end="00:22:49.860" style="s2">so try and see if that is a helpful RIA</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.290" end="00:22:52.690" style="s2">orientation for you Kelly</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.860" end="00:22:55.570" style="s2">Liu quest I&#39;ve been repeating day eight</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.690" end="00:22:57.430" style="s2">for six days as I&#39;m still taking maybe</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.570" end="00:22:59.200" style="s2">eight to take 10 minutes to Center</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.430" end="00:23:00.700" style="s2">really can flow my being overly</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.200" end="00:23:03.400" style="s2">perfectionist or should I stay with this</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.700" end="00:23:06.900" style="s2">part until it feels right I would say it</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.400" end="00:23:09.160" style="s2">probably is right enough or good enough</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.900" end="00:23:10.750" style="s2">don&#39;t worry about how long it takes of</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.160" end="00:23:14.410" style="s2">it if it takes you about eight to 10</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.750" end="00:23:16.960" style="s2">minutes for a while do that I strongly</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.410" end="00:23:19.090" style="s2">recommend you move on now you move on</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.960" end="00:23:21.010" style="s2">because as you move on and you start</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.090" end="00:23:23.620" style="s2">learning the practices that build on</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.010" end="00:23:27.760" style="s2">that those will become more properly and</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.620" end="00:23:29.860" style="s2">appropriately like a background it but</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.760" end="00:23:31.960" style="s2">integrated with the new practices and</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.860" end="00:23:34.050" style="s2">they&#39;ll be less sort of focal and you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.960" end="00:23:37.450" style="s2">you&#39;ll be less tempted towards a</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.050" end="00:23:40.960" style="s2">possible perfectionism so I think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.450" end="00:23:46.650" style="s2">doing it good enough don&#39;t and move on I</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.960" end="00:23:49.000" style="s2">strongly recommend that here at Kroger</p>

<p begin="00:24:05.260" end="00:24:09.250" style="s2">image is it normal to start to have a</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.790" end="00:24:11.260" style="s2">lot of religious imagery come up if you</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.250" end="00:24:14.560" style="s2">had a religious background with imagery</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.260" end="00:24:18.630" style="s2">coming up is very normal</p>

<p begin="00:25:20.790" end="00:25:26.550" style="s2">wonderful but it is important and do</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.690" end="00:25:29.070" style="s2">right and we have to be in right</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.550" end="00:25:30.690" style="s2">relationship to it so very much</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.070" end="00:25:32.970" style="s2">religious imagery will come up if you</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.690" end="00:25:36.180" style="s2">had a religious upbringing I speak from</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.970" end="00:25:38.700" style="s2">experience and pay attention to this</p>

<p begin="00:25:50.460" end="00:25:57.390" style="s2">come into far more conscious awareness</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.860" end="00:25:59.460" style="s2">so take this as a gift and hopefully if</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.390" end="00:26:03.120" style="s2">you relate to it appropriately that will</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.460" end="00:26:06.480" style="s2">help you to become more explicitly aware</p>

<p begin="00:27:18.680" end="00:27:23.730" style="s2">instead of using the Train I looked at</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.480" end="00:27:25.590" style="s2">the sky cloudy and noticed patches of</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.730" end="00:27:27.480" style="s2">blue expanding and that&#39;s where I focus</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.590" end="00:27:29.910" style="s2">the clouds are all of my thoughts the</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.480" end="00:27:31.350" style="s2">blue is clarity and pieces.this okay I</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.910" end="00:27:33.450" style="s2">think I&#39;m only getting part of your</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.350" end="00:27:34.890" style="s2">question do you mean like instead of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.450" end="00:27:38.160" style="s2">train of thought I&#39;m looking you look at</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.890" end="00:27:40.950" style="s2">the stuff that&#39;s fine the the sky in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.160" end="00:27:46.650" style="s2">clouds is also a traditional metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.950" end="00:27:48.000" style="s2">used I use the Train because it connects</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.650" end="00:27:49.740" style="s2">with the metaphor of train of thought</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.000" end="00:27:53.340" style="s2">and it tends to have a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.740" end="00:27:55.680" style="s2">of that sense of power and overwhelming</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.340" end="00:27:57.690" style="s2">speed that I thought to have but if the</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.680" end="00:28:00.570" style="s2">clouds and the sky work for you that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.690" end="00:28:02.250" style="s2">also a traditional image that&#39;s great as</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.570" end="00:28:03.930" style="s2">long as you don&#39;t as long as you want</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.250" end="00:28:07.470" style="s2">sort of getting really heavy and just</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.930" end="00:28:09.180" style="s2">sort of move right so as long as what</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.470" end="00:28:11.730" style="s2">you said is the case that you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.180" end="00:28:14.730" style="s2">a lot of clarity and you and that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.730" end="00:28:17.820" style="s2">got it so the thing about the sky is</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.730" end="00:28:19.920" style="s2">make sure you have a sense that there is</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.820" end="00:28:23.210" style="s2">a lot that still needs that there&#39;s a</p>
