<p begin="00:00:00.890" end="00:00:05.009" style="s2">okay i&#39;m going to try something a little</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.120" end="00:00:06.839" style="s2">different today i just want to share</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.009" end="00:00:08.160" style="s2">with you some of my reflections on</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.839" end="00:00:10.080" style="s2">something I&#39;ve been thinking about in</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.160" end="00:00:11.580" style="s2">the last couple of days so I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.080" end="00:00:15.210" style="s2">rereading this awesome book right here</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.580" end="00:00:18.300" style="s2">where mathematics comes from by Rafael</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.210" end="00:00:21.060" style="s2">Nunez and George leg off it&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.300" end="00:00:23.130" style="s2">book because it introduces cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.060" end="00:00:25.439" style="s2">science to the study of mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.130" end="00:00:28.289" style="s2">thought and I&#39;ve read this book before</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.439" end="00:00:31.590" style="s2">but as I was reading it this weekend is</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.289" end="00:00:34.559" style="s2">reflecting on the importance of bridging</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.590" end="00:00:36.210" style="s2">the gap between three areas specific</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.559" end="00:00:38.480" style="s2">knowledge bases like mathematics or</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.210" end="00:00:41.969" style="s2">physics or chemistry or what have you</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.480" end="00:00:44.340" style="s2">the field of cognitive science which is</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.969" end="00:00:47.940" style="s2">looking at Lord&#39;s go BR look netam human</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.340" end="00:00:50.520" style="s2">behavior in the mind and then the realm</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.940" end="00:00:52.739" style="s2">of philosophy just the assumptions we</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.520" end="00:00:54.960" style="s2">have about how things work and about</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.739" end="00:00:57.510" style="s2">what is knowable and what is real and</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.960" end="00:01:00.180" style="s2">what&#39;s good and what&#39;s bad and so on and</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.510" end="00:01:02.640" style="s2">um I&#39;ve been reading this book again</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.180" end="00:01:04.739" style="s2">I&#39;ve realized that one of the more</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.640" end="00:01:07.710" style="s2">important things that cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.739" end="00:01:11.180" style="s2">can bring to other disciplines is what</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.710" end="00:01:14.549" style="s2">George Lake often Mark Johnson call</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.180" end="00:01:16.110" style="s2">empirically responsible philosophy now</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.549" end="00:01:20.189" style="s2">empirically responsible philosophy is</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.110" end="00:01:22.950" style="s2">simply recognizing that our assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.189" end="00:01:25.080" style="s2">about philosophical topics can be skewed</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.950" end="00:01:27.360" style="s2">or biased by our worldviews and by our</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.080" end="00:01:30.150" style="s2">value systems and so we can actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.360" end="00:01:32.970" style="s2">have blind spots very significant blind</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.150" end="00:01:34.979" style="s2">spots about the world and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.970" end="00:01:37.740" style="s2">possible to develop for very elaborate</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.979" end="00:01:40.380" style="s2">philosophical arguments that are really</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.740" end="00:01:42.240" style="s2">untrue in a very foundational level make</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.380" end="00:01:45.570" style="s2">an assumption about the human mind that</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.240" end="00:01:49.700" style="s2">has been validated by research in brain</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.570" end="00:01:53.610" style="s2">science for example and what&#39;s needed to</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.700" end="00:01:55.950" style="s2">remedy this problem when it arises is to</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.610" end="00:01:58.380" style="s2">have a really strong understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.950" end="00:02:00.810" style="s2">what cognitive science is telling us</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.380" end="00:02:04.020" style="s2">about human nature and about the mind</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.810" end="00:02:07.049" style="s2">about language and thought so that when</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.020" end="00:02:08.970" style="s2">we articulate a philosophical argument</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.049" end="00:02:12.180" style="s2">we can determine whether or not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.970" end="00:02:13.800" style="s2">empirically responsible are we being</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.180" end="00:02:15.720" style="s2">responsible with our understanding</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.800" end="00:02:18.090" style="s2">of where our philosophies come from</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.720" end="00:02:19.500" style="s2">whether or not they&#39;re correct and if</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.090" end="00:02:22.020" style="s2">we&#39;re making assumptions about human</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.500" end="00:02:23.850" style="s2">beings that fly in the face of what</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.020" end="00:02:26.100" style="s2">science has told us about what it means</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.850" end="00:02:27.480" style="s2">to be human now I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.100" end="00:02:30.000" style="s2">something that&#39;s especially important</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.480" end="00:02:32.790" style="s2">when you look at the application of</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.000" end="00:02:34.620" style="s2">philosophy to economics where we have</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.790" end="00:02:37.230" style="s2">different theories about rational action</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.620" end="00:02:39.780" style="s2">and economic behavior and the theories</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.230" end="00:02:42.390" style="s2">are basically ad hoc assumptions have no</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.780" end="00:02:44.850" style="s2">basis in reality they were formulated</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.390" end="00:02:46.230" style="s2">oftentimes by mathematicians or by</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.850" end="00:02:49.110" style="s2">people who don&#39;t know much of anything</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.230" end="00:02:52.110" style="s2">about real human behavior and so the</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.110" end="00:02:55.650" style="s2">theories can stand for decades in some</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.110" end="00:02:58.050" style="s2">cases without ever being tested relative</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.650" end="00:02:59.790" style="s2">to what is known and psychology and</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.050" end="00:03:02.520" style="s2">brain research in anthropological</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.790" end="00:03:04.800" style="s2">research and in other fields that could</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.520" end="00:03:07.530" style="s2">guide us more effectively so when we</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.800" end="00:03:09.840" style="s2">need to solve big problems like building</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.530" end="00:03:12.240" style="s2">a sustainable global economy we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.840" end="00:03:14.400" style="s2">want to just have philosophies that are</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.240" end="00:03:16.590" style="s2">ad hoc we want to have ways as</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.400" end="00:03:17.580" style="s2">systematically determining whether what</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.590" end="00:03:19.250" style="s2">we&#39;re doing is in the right ballpark</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.580" end="00:03:22.830" style="s2">course we&#39;re completely off our rocker</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.250" end="00:03:25.890" style="s2">it turns out cognitive science can help</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.830" end="00:03:28.020" style="s2">us to do that so I&#39;ve been advocating</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.890" end="00:03:30.270" style="s2">for a number of years now that cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.020" end="00:03:33.630" style="s2">science should be taught and should be</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.270" end="00:03:36.000" style="s2">employed as part of our work in</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.630" end="00:03:39.420" style="s2">developing philosophies for a society</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.000" end="00:03:41.280" style="s2">and for building our social policies so</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.420" end="00:03:43.320" style="s2">that we can be more effective at solving</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.280" end="00:03:46.190" style="s2">real-world problems I&#39;d love to know</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.320" end="00:03:46.190" style="s2">what you think about this</p>
