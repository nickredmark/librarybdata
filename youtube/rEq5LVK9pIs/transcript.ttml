<p begin="00:00:12.059" end="00:00:16.170" style="s2">done brilliant work of separating</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.580" end="00:00:17.970" style="s2">intelligence rationality alright yeah</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.170" end="00:00:19.859" style="s2">yeah I&#39;ve been following that as well</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.970" end="00:00:22.070" style="s2">yeah yeah that has to be understood as</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.859" end="00:00:24.900" style="s2">three different levels you could say</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.070" end="00:00:27.029" style="s2">like the drive system with it then I</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.900" end="00:00:28.380" style="s2">would wait up as well we took the</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.029" end="00:00:30.179" style="s2">original two distinctions for</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.380" end="00:00:32.189" style="s2">psychoanalysis from say Jacques Lacan</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.179" end="00:00:34.469" style="s2">said there&#39;s driving there&#39;s desire and</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.189" end="00:00:36.840" style="s2">their conflict with one another we said</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.469" end="00:00:39.450" style="s2">that there&#39;s four there&#39;s a king sting</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.840" end="00:00:42.239" style="s2">ring is Drive there&#39;s desire and this</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.450" end="00:00:44.340" style="s2">transcendence and they&#39;re all drives so</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.239" end="00:00:47.309" style="s2">they&#39;re all something inside of you that</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.340" end="00:00:49.440" style="s2">wants something right instinct is</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.309" end="00:00:51.270" style="s2">animalistic instinct it was to share</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.440" end="00:00:53.489" style="s2">with animals animals operate according</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.270" end="00:00:55.620" style="s2">to instance OD human beings we do it</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.489" end="00:00:57.570" style="s2">from the day were born little Gabriel</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.620" end="00:01:00.059" style="s2">crawled to his mother&#39;s tit soon as</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.570" end="00:01:02.609" style="s2">possible yeah in Hey</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.059" end="00:01:04.920" style="s2">the other one is drive which is eerily</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.609" end="00:01:08.970" style="s2">weird because it exists between desire</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.920" end="00:01:11.280" style="s2">and instinct is a mechanistic okay</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.970" end="00:01:13.439" style="s2">something inside of you that wants some</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.280" end="00:01:15.810" style="s2">point so when you sit with a therapist</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.439" end="00:01:17.460" style="s2">or an analyst and you analyze your drive</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.810" end="00:01:21.180" style="s2">system you will discover the drive a</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.460" end="00:01:22.890" style="s2">certain different from instinct watch a</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.180" end="00:01:25.229" style="s2">little in Europe whereas drive has the</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.890" end="00:01:28.229" style="s2">party buddy some pops up from out of</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.229" end="00:01:31.530" style="s2">nowhere it demands of you that it what</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.229" end="00:01:33.630" style="s2">it wants in a mechanistic fashion it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.530" end="00:01:35.549" style="s2">almost like you&#39;re a machine and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.630" end="00:01:37.680" style="s2">exactly what happens we were exploited</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.549" end="00:01:39.240" style="s2">in mode or the negative archetype it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.680" end="00:01:42.479" style="s2">almost like an archetype controlling you</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.240" end="00:01:43.890" style="s2">or something it&#39;s not a negativity if</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.479" end="00:01:46.710" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna survive a little fucking</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.890" end="00:01:48.210" style="s2">each part of the drive system you need</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.710" end="00:01:50.189" style="s2">to fucking drink when you&#39;re thirsty</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.210" end="00:01:52.500" style="s2">the other one is desire desire is</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.189" end="00:01:54.509" style="s2">exclusively human so that wasn&#39;t a star</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.500" end="00:01:57.329" style="s2">system that is human is part of desire</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.509" end="00:01:59.310" style="s2">that means desire is tied to language we</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.329" end="00:02:01.860" style="s2">cannot have decide unless have language</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.310" end="00:02:03.780" style="s2">first you don&#39;t see higher operating in</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.860" end="00:02:05.310" style="s2">the newborn child for example but as</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.780" end="00:02:07.200" style="s2">soon as we have language and we started</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.310" end="00:02:10.800" style="s2">use words so we say things like you</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.200" end="00:02:13.500" style="s2">there and me here and was not a language</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.800" end="00:02:15.570" style="s2">we will also create desire</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.500" end="00:02:17.520" style="s2">iris is a real knockout because desire</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.570" end="00:02:21.150" style="s2">wants only one thing and that&#39;s the main</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.520" end="00:02:23.340" style="s2">aim itself so desire has by nature it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.150" end="00:02:24.810" style="s2">like oh I won&#39;t that woman I really want</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.340" end="00:02:26.760" style="s2">that woman and then will you get what</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.810" end="00:02:28.980" style="s2">you wanted your sire has already moved</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.760" end="00:02:31.590" style="s2">on to something else yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.980" end="00:02:34.200" style="s2">do you see also hero desire also because</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.590" end="00:02:35.970" style="s2">of language operates any rearm where he</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.200" end="00:02:36.750" style="s2">will turn you into an exploitative</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.970" end="00:02:38.910" style="s2">machine</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.750" end="00:02:41.820" style="s2">well well Jared says the desire is by</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.910" end="00:02:43.200" style="s2">nature a memetic right it&#39;s the medic in</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.820" end="00:02:44.550" style="s2">the sense you learn the words from</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.200" end="00:02:46.560" style="s2">somebody else yes but it&#39;s tied to</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.550" end="00:02:49.530" style="s2">language its linguistic and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.560" end="00:02:52.020" style="s2">therefore deeply human now the problem</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.530" end="00:02:53.820" style="s2">is that if you take religion out of</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.020" end="00:02:56.040" style="s2">psychoanalysis you and what pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.820" end="00:02:57.660" style="s2">there now if you take religion bad</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.040" end="00:02:59.580" style="s2">people cycle mothers listen you just</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.660" end="00:03:01.860" style="s2">make the radical move John so dickfist</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.580" end="00:03:03.930" style="s2">and I did in digital libido which is to</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.860" end="00:03:06.860" style="s2">say that wait a second would strive</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.930" end="00:03:10.200" style="s2">towards something higher and more noble</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.860" end="00:03:12.000" style="s2">not for ourselves to be superior to our</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.200" end="00:03:14.160" style="s2">neighbors but rather because you want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.000" end="00:03:15.840" style="s2">achieve something in our lies mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.160" end="00:03:17.489" style="s2">that is called transcendence and</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.840" end="00:03:20.220" style="s2">transcendence should be described as a</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.489" end="00:03:22.140" style="s2">drive it shouldn&#39;t be strive as the</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.220" end="00:03:23.730" style="s2">thing in itself that we strive for it</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.140" end="00:03:27.450" style="s2">should be destroyed simply as to drive</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.730" end="00:03:30.480" style="s2">the complements instinct Drive and</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.450" end="00:03:32.250" style="s2">desire instinct pure driving desire so</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.480" end="00:03:34.549" style="s2">do you the fourth one is transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.250" end="00:03:38.400" style="s2">now if you make that pattern you see</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.549" end="00:03:41.190" style="s2">that drive is a meta instinct and you</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.400" end="00:03:42.660" style="s2">see that entire is a meta drive and you</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.190" end="00:03:45.269" style="s2">see some of the transcendence is</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.660" end="00:03:48.239" style="s2">essentially a meta desire you could even</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.269" end="00:03:50.040" style="s2">go to shock Lacan who claimed he was not</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.239" end="00:03:51.690" style="s2">religious and it was of course the end</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.040" end="00:03:54.209" style="s2">of psychoanalysis as we know it</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.690" end="00:03:56.010" style="s2">you can basically tell shock you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.209" end="00:03:58.290" style="s2">really discuss anywhere you work what</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.010" end="00:04:00.060" style="s2">you do with a successful patient or the</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.290" end="00:04:02.340" style="s2">successful model it&#39;s on if you</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.060" end="00:04:03.750" style="s2">succeeded with young person or your</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.340" end="00:04:07.040" style="s2">advice in psychoanalysis</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.750" end="00:04:09.630" style="s2">what do you do with the guy succeeded</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.040" end="00:04:12.450" style="s2">that&#39;s just the end right it&#39;s over</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.630" end="00:04:17.729" style="s2">right at that point no it&#39;s not over</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.450" end="00:04:21.900" style="s2">exactly it&#39;s not a mistake that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.729" end="00:04:23.760" style="s2">religion starts perhaps exactly that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.900" end="00:04:25.700" style="s2">why the only way to get out of say</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.760" end="00:04:27.440" style="s2">Slovaks current predicament</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.700" end="00:04:29.720" style="s2">it&#39;s to recognize that he&#39;s religious</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.440" end="00:04:31.460" style="s2">and his religion is called communism and</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.720" end="00:04:33.890" style="s2">I actually shared with him it&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.460" end="00:04:36.320" style="s2">religion but it&#39;s a good religion so you</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.890" end="00:04:38.480" style="s2">you you got to understand trance as a</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.320" end="00:04:41.080" style="s2">fourth Drive no you can then go back and</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.480" end="00:04:43.940" style="s2">take Sean for various excellent work and</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.080" end="00:04:45.530" style="s2">realize that intelligence that we need</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.940" end="00:04:47.180" style="s2">to understand how quickly because</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.530" end="00:04:49.850" style="s2">obviously we&#39;re making machines in one</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.180" end="00:04:52.490" style="s2">of them it&#39;s only the basis on which you</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.850" end="00:04:54.800" style="s2">can then based rationality as Amanda</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.490" end="00:04:56.300" style="s2">intelligence once you got arrived at</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.800" end="00:04:58.910" style="s2">rationality I&#39;ve to understand the</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.300" end="00:05:01.010" style="s2">limits to rationality John for Varkey</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.910" end="00:05:03.080" style="s2">and study Chris and I both call these</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.010" end="00:05:04.520" style="s2">trance rationalism we&#39;ve invented the</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.080" end="00:05:06.590" style="s2">term separate from one another</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.520" end="00:05:11.800" style="s2">so that is that is can I can I see if I</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.590" end="00:05:11.800" style="s2">understand wisdom is not merely</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.490" end="00:05:18.260" style="s2">rationality and intelligence is that</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.380" end="00:05:20.210" style="s2">correct no it&#39;s you take rationality if</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.260" end="00:05:21.980" style="s2">you are you recently be rational and</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.210" end="00:05:23.690" style="s2">rational it&#39;s not only logical it&#39;s way</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.980" end="00:05:26.390" style="s2">more than that don&#39;t provide excellent</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.690" end="00:05:28.220" style="s2">work explaining this so give me no mark</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.390" end="00:05:30.050" style="s2">it once again lissajous different</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.220" end="00:05:31.970" style="s2">episodes I think this is like episode 40</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.050" end="00:05:34.210" style="s2">or 41 and you get to the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.970" end="00:05:35.480" style="s2">rationality is way more than logic so</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.210" end="00:05:37.550" style="s2">rationalism</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.480" end="00:05:38.960" style="s2">you know so if you don&#39;t a rationality</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.550" end="00:05:41.900" style="s2">only have intelligence you get a very</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.960" end="00:05:43.550" style="s2">stupid machine you&#39;re very me and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.900" end="00:05:45.860" style="s2">world is unfortunately full of people</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.550" end="00:05:50.110" style="s2">are very high IQs but incredibly stupid</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.860" end="00:05:53.180" style="s2">right right and they&#39;re dangerous right</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.110" end="00:05:56.270" style="s2">it&#39;s only the basis on which you can</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.180" end="00:05:58.640" style="s2">then build the rationality rationality</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.270" end="00:06:01.880" style="s2">thrives really arise where it should be</p>

<p begin="00:07:51.649" end="00:07:57.860" style="s2">okay that means that intelligence just</p>

<p begin="00:09:01.639" end="00:09:05.600" style="s2">the metrical is all the way back to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.829" end="00:09:09.199" style="s2">very origin of religion where hardly</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.600" end="00:09:11.690" style="s2">anybody else seems neat history and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.199" end="00:09:14.269" style="s2">word for that is no my knowledge II know</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.690" end="00:09:15.949" style="s2">mythology is the original religion the</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.269" end="00:09:17.630" style="s2">reason why we need the religion in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.949" end="00:09:19.940" style="s2">first place and what we create its</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.630" end="00:09:25.579" style="s2">religion itself it&#39;s sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.940" end="00:09:27.920" style="s2">blueprint of yeah so to reformulate and</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.579" end="00:09:29.779" style="s2">reconstruct or construct a religion that</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.920" end="00:09:32.389" style="s2">works for us today our word provided</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.779" end="00:09:34.790" style="s2">Sufism we need to go back and say okay</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.389" end="00:09:36.680" style="s2">what is phallic it was a magical and we</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.790" end="00:09:38.180" style="s2">didn&#39;t necessarily do that division of</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.680" end="00:09:40.370" style="s2">the senses and book doesn&#39;t we need to</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.180" end="00:09:43.310" style="s2">write the third book now in a trilogy to</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.370" end="00:09:45.410" style="s2">explore that idea totally and I think it</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.310" end="00:09:47.139" style="s2">has to do with great different missions</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.410" end="00:09:51.170" style="s2">where all phallic it could tokenism</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.139" end="00:09:53.630" style="s2">cosmopolitanism and working on that we</p>

<p begin="00:09:53.630" end="00:09:57.500" style="s2">is really to arrive in what the</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.459" end="00:10:00.230" style="s2">Zoroaster is called a permanent state of</p>

<p begin="00:11:13.980" end="00:11:18.720" style="s2">and you call it experimental ISM huh</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.690" end="00:11:20.940" style="s2">yeah for now yeah for now know anybody</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.720" end="00:11:22.500" style="s2">who listens to this conversation has</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.940" end="00:11:25.020" style="s2">gotten this far can certainly</p>

<p begin="00:11:26.459" end="00:11:31.320" style="s2">all jump when we see the name of a place</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.589" end="00:11:33.709" style="s2">or what state that we&#39;re looking for but</p>

<p begin="00:12:07.350" end="00:12:11.339" style="s2">have to unpack that because I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.390" end="00:12:13.680" style="s2">really understand that the Machine will</p>

<p begin="00:13:06.690" end="00:13:10.770" style="s2">you know certainly Napoleon was the mild</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.940" end="00:13:13.140" style="s2">version of it Hitler and Stalin were</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.770" end="00:13:17.630" style="s2">much worse versus of it what do we call</p>

<p begin="00:13:27.320" end="00:13:33.560" style="s2">a way they became demented and perverted</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.030" end="00:13:38.900" style="s2">what happened what happened in here also</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.560" end="00:13:41.750" style="s2">my 1945 yeah we dropped a bomb exactly</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.900" end="00:13:44.300" style="s2">a bomb that would destroy us all unless</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.750" end="00:13:46.850" style="s2">he was contained how do you contain the</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.300" end="00:13:49.460" style="s2">atomic bomb you&#39;re starting your</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.850" end="00:13:51.860" style="s2">religion that contains the bomb we will</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.460" end="00:13:54.380" style="s2">not be able to contain the atomic bomb</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.860" end="00:13:56.870" style="s2">and that&#39;s a way worse threat tossed and</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.380" end="00:13:58.430" style="s2">climate we will not contain the atomic</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.870" end="00:14:01.280" style="s2">bomb but lesser formulas and religion</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.430" end="00:14:03.620" style="s2">that we all accept mm-hmm where the bomb</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.280" end="00:14:06.320" style="s2">is being contained me if the bump</p>

<p begin="00:14:11.900" end="00:14:18.740" style="s2">with apocalypse that is the real threat</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.230" end="00:14:20.510" style="s2">yeah yeah the real threat is children</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.740" end="00:14:23.720" style="s2">taking over the world with powerful</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.510" end="00:14:26.240" style="s2">tools powerful not the struggle weapons</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.720" end="00:14:28.730" style="s2">Oh what did we do with the bomb both of</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.240" end="00:14:30.860" style="s2">the Soviet Union in the United States we</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.730" end="00:14:33.770" style="s2">contained the bomb by creating an</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.860" end="00:14:36.280" style="s2">elaborate system when no kid on his own</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.770" end="00:14:39.890" style="s2">could golf and press the button hmm</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.280" end="00:14:41.810" style="s2">that&#39;s a minimum of security against</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.890" end="00:14:44.710" style="s2">ourselves being these children who are</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.810" end="00:14:48.080" style="s2">grumpy and suddenly blow up everything</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.710" end="00:14:51.050" style="s2">so the search for wisdom starts already</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.080" end="00:14:52.760" style="s2">there we have we have a nucleus of a</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.050" end="00:14:55.610" style="s2">search for wisdom that&#39;s applicable to</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.760" end="00:14:59.120" style="s2">our age that starts with hiroshima</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.610" end="00:15:00.140" style="s2">august 1945 the problem was that that</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.120" end="00:15:04.070" style="s2">created the trauma</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.140" end="00:15:06.410" style="s2">we&#39;re so terrified of the phallic energy</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.070" end="00:15:08.180" style="s2">being in the wrong hands like being a</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.410" end="00:15:11.900" style="s2">boy like Hitler a boy like Stalin</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.180" end="00:15:13.790" style="s2">insecure power over the world so because</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.900" end="00:15:15.950" style="s2">it was Hitler and Stalin and Mao who</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.790" end="00:15:17.840" style="s2">created the atomic bomb you know Hitler</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.950" end="00:15:19.370" style="s2">could have had the bomb he could East</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.840" end="00:15:21.140" style="s2">have had it America&#39;s managed to create</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.370" end="00:15:23.060" style="s2">only possible we&#39;re working on it</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.140" end="00:15:27.740" style="s2">installing credible a 12-mile crater</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.060" end="00:15:30.780" style="s2">bomb mmm it&#39;s precisely these rasoi and</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.740" end="00:15:32.850" style="s2">little boys you created atomic bomb</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.780" end="00:15:35.130" style="s2">and that bombed recipes now spreading</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.850" end="00:15:38.580" style="s2">and all the tapes of some cynical little</p>

<p begin="00:15:40.410" end="00:15:44.220" style="s2">once it does / did blow things up we all</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.660" end="00:15:46.230" style="s2">know that if Islamic state had had</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.220" end="00:15:48.240" style="s2">access to the atomic bomb the world</p>

<p begin="00:15:48.240" end="00:15:53.910" style="s2">this close so if we look real threat</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.990" end="00:15:55.710" style="s2">it&#39;s not even quite a bet this costly</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.910" end="00:15:57.930" style="s2">look into the real threat which is the</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.710" end="00:16:00.720" style="s2">third world war run by atomic bombs</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.930" end="00:16:02.940" style="s2">mm-hmm that war can only be described as</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.720" end="00:16:05.640" style="s2">something that can come out of a secular</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.940" end="00:16:07.830" style="s2">world where children are allowed to run</p>

<p begin="00:16:07.830" end="00:16:15.150" style="s2">bomb yeah we need influence systems with</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.270" end="00:16:16.080" style="s2">systems of wisdom that prevents that</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.150" end="00:16:18.000" style="s2">from happening</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.080" end="00:16:19.530" style="s2">that&#39;s the triumph of the Joker if I</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.000" end="00:16:20.670" style="s2">come back to the movie in a way you know</p>

<p begin="00:16:36.180" end="00:16:39.480" style="s2">can grow up religion is the space within</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.920" end="00:16:42.089" style="s2">which we grow up from children to</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.480" end="00:16:43.980" style="s2">grownups mm-hmm okay</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.089" end="00:16:45.810" style="s2">we entered the world of path for so long</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.980" end="00:16:47.790" style="s2">that&#39;s a good definition of a religion I</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.810" end="00:16:49.290" style="s2">like that we leave the world we leave</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.790" end="00:16:50.730" style="s2">the world of myth us where children are</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.290" end="00:16:53.070" style="s2">being brought up and walk into the world</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.730" end="00:16:55.020" style="s2">the first logos and later pathos we walk</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.070" end="00:16:56.339" style="s2">into the world of science and sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.020" end="00:16:58.440" style="s2">that&#39;s essentially what I call the</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.339" end="00:17:00.570" style="s2">grown-up world and religion introduces</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.440" end="00:17:02.640" style="s2">us to those words so we can comprehend</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.570" end="00:17:05.069" style="s2">them understand them and use them in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.640" end="00:17:07.620" style="s2">right way we were there other ways the</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.069" end="00:17:10.740" style="s2">two things who will fail on our violence</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.620" end="00:17:13.410" style="s2">and sexuality hey where are we failing</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.740" end="00:17:15.870" style="s2">today violence and sexuality you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.410" end="00:17:17.850" style="s2">clearly jewelry arms of logos and pathos</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.870" end="00:17:19.500" style="s2">and they&#39;re not for children those</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.850" end="00:17:21.000" style="s2">drones are not for children real</p>

<p begin="00:17:23.520" end="00:17:26.760" style="s2">vehicles instead of providing them with</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.170" end="00:17:29.460" style="s2">proper religion with the children so</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.760" end="00:17:30.660" style="s2">they ready to be introduced into proper</p>

<p begin="00:17:36.630" end="00:17:42.660" style="s2">1945 what has been the cost we&#39;ve paid</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.179" end="00:17:43.779" style="s2">at least keep nuclear bombs locked up</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.660" end="00:17:47.690" style="s2">within some</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.779" end="00:17:49.370" style="s2">the wisdom what is the pricing paid for</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.690" end="00:17:52.700" style="s2">that the price you paid for that is that</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.370" end="00:17:55.399" style="s2">we blamed father&#39;s for for it for the</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.700" end="00:17:59.000" style="s2">problem yeah so the atomic bomb was this</p>

<p begin="00:19:34.700" end="00:19:38.419" style="s2">with that what phallic religion is all</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.169" end="00:19:40.580" style="s2">about my response to that is to go back</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.419" end="00:19:43.159" style="s2">to the purest form of phallic models and</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.580" end="00:19:45.529" style="s2">that exist which is a raster listen you</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.159" end="00:19:47.870" style="s2">can also go back to Taoism for example</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.529" end="00:19:49.820" style="s2">you can take the the young separate from</p>

<p begin="00:19:55.220" end="00:19:59.779" style="s2">should have taken it on right if</p>

<p begin="00:19:59.779" end="00:20:03.499" style="s2">think David Chapman would agree with me</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.759" end="00:20:04.999" style="s2">exactly that&#39;s what we agree with</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.499" end="00:20:06.980" style="s2">Chapman that&#39;s what we love time to</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.999" end="00:20:08.960" style="s2">Buddhism oh my onna Buddhism to be given</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.980" end="00:20:11.480" style="s2">Buddhism in response to store asterism</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.960" end="00:20:12.230" style="s2">includes the phallic element because it</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.480" end="00:20:14.059" style="s2">is monist</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.230" end="00:20:15.889" style="s2">you cannot have a monastic religion that</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.059" end="00:20:19.369" style="s2">ignores either the phallic or the</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.889" end="00:20:22.190" style="s2">magical the way Western religion did so</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.369" end="00:20:24.559" style="s2">so asterism as a large place for matric</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.190" end="00:20:26.210" style="s2">on the mat before this begs or accidents</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.559" end="00:20:28.940" style="s2">was preached equality between the</p>

<p begin="00:20:31.249" end="00:20:35.179" style="s2">thousand seven hundred years that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.230" end="00:20:37.970" style="s2">the world is full of strong Iranian and</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.179" end="00:20:40.190" style="s2">Kurdish women so that&#39;s the evidence of</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.970" end="00:20:42.529" style="s2">that culture so it&#39;s not a neglect</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.190" end="00:20:44.960" style="s2">Dometic he said direct motion that we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:20:44.960" end="00:20:49.070" style="s2">always success the problem is that we</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.999" end="00:20:50.570" style="s2">haven&#39;t really understood the value of</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.070" end="00:20:51.499" style="s2">the fully grown up religion of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.570" end="00:20:55.539" style="s2">phallic religion which is the religion</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.499" end="00:20:59.119" style="s2">of men this is the religion that contain</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.539" end="00:21:01.639" style="s2">pain violence it contains engineering</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.119" end="00:21:03.619" style="s2">and architecture mm-hmm every damn</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.639" end="00:21:05.720" style="s2">building in the world every damn road in</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.619" end="00:21:09.739" style="s2">the world is built by men not by women</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.720" end="00:21:11.299" style="s2">or children okay so the phallic religion</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.739" end="00:21:14.869" style="s2">we have to go back and understand the</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.299" end="00:21:17.269" style="s2">distance between authentic and fake</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.869" end="00:21:19.369" style="s2">phallus well we arrived at that is that</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.269" end="00:21:21.470" style="s2">the fake father says his field day like</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.369" end="00:21:24.910" style="s2">Hitler Stalin have a field day when you</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.470" end="00:21:27.850" style="s2">first secularized the society</p>

<p begin="00:21:27.850" end="00:21:33.700" style="s2">better than religion I&#39;m like hey Hitler</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.860" end="00:21:35.590" style="s2">Stalin Mao really yeah okay I mean a</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.700" end="00:21:40.330" style="s2">system is the worst innovation we ever</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.590" end="00:21:42.040" style="s2">did do you know usually from that</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.330" end="00:21:43.420" style="s2">question they always say oh yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.040" end="00:21:47.800" style="s2">with their religions too or something</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.420" end="00:21:49.660" style="s2">but that&#39;s what it&#39;s very silly the only</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.800" end="00:21:51.820" style="s2">difference between Joker and Hitler is a</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.660" end="00:21:53.800" style="s2">joker so damn selfish that he only</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.820" end="00:21:56.140" style="s2">thinks of himself and turned to solving</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.800" end="00:21:57.910" style="s2">his own private Hitler whereas Hitler</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.140" end="00:22:00.630" style="s2">wasn&#39;t least enough with that he wanted</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.910" end="00:22:04.930" style="s2">to conquer the world according to jokowi</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.630" end="00:22:08.590" style="s2">and there you see what Nazism is No so</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.930" end="00:22:10.360" style="s2">the fake file is undeniably war and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.590" end="00:22:13.930" style="s2">fake file it unifies people through</p>

<p begin="00:24:58.029" end="00:25:02.110" style="s2">so irrigation is how it starts and</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.799" end="00:25:04.570" style="s2">because you irrigate the earth and you</p>

<p begin="00:26:37.390" end="00:26:42.940" style="s2">what would you really really want which</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.120" end="00:26:45.250" style="s2">would really set the tribe free to</p>

<p begin="00:26:45.250" end="00:26:53.620" style="s2">actually do yeah I suspect it will take</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.070" end="00:26:55.990" style="s2">some time before this word is is you</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.620" end="00:26:59.170" style="s2">know dissociated from all of its</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.990" end="00:27:00.430" style="s2">negative connotations or well that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.170" end="00:27:02.170" style="s2">problem with everything you do within</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.430" end="00:27:04.510" style="s2">philosophies that you use the word but</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.170" end="00:27:07.090" style="s2">then you use it provocatively as I do</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.510" end="00:27:08.050" style="s2">right salvation yeah you&#39;re using it</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.090" end="00:27:14.050" style="s2">provocatively</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.050" end="00:27:15.340" style="s2">and not in a dynamic way not automatic</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.050" end="00:27:18.190" style="s2">because you should never be in dogmatic</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.340" end="00:27:20.560" style="s2">wasn&#39;t even took my David Marx Karl Marx</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.190" end="00:27:23.350" style="s2">clearly said that you need to reach a</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.560" end="00:27:25.210" style="s2">certain stage in philosophy and in</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.350" end="00:27:28.150" style="s2">history before you can even contemplate</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.210" end="00:27:31.150" style="s2">the possibility and communism yeah Marx</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.150" end="00:27:33.490" style="s2">would definitely had said no to learning</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.150" end="00:27:37.780" style="s2">in 1918 to the Russian Revolution we</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.490" end="00:27:39.640" style="s2">were remotely communist mmm-hmm he was a</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.780" end="00:27:47.200" style="s2">little boys fantasy again a little boys</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.640" end="00:27:52.030" style="s2">fantasy well again Lenin Lenin used Marx</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.200" end="00:27:53.890" style="s2">philosophy but he ran ahead of a he run</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.030" end="00:27:56.620" style="s2">ahead of the game if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.890" end="00:27:58.780" style="s2">understand Jaime you&#39;re not wise with</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.620" end="00:28:00.820" style="s2">some it&#39;s all about timing</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.780" end="00:28:04.320" style="s2">yeah he&#39;s Marx philosophy and a very</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.820" end="00:28:07.960" style="s2">unwise way and and that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.320" end="00:28:10.059" style="s2">Marxist philosophy seems to people use</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.960" end="00:28:12.999" style="s2">Marxist philosophy in an unwise way it</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.059" end="00:28:15.190" style="s2">seems to be like a large problem right</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.999" end="00:28:17.470" style="s2">and Lenny would agree with us that he</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.190" end="00:28:19.539" style="s2">died as a tragedy why because on his</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.470" end="00:28:21.879" style="s2">deathbed he realized that Stalin would</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.539" end="00:28:23.739" style="s2">replace him and he warned everybody</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.879" end="00:28:26.109" style="s2">about Stalin but he hadn&#39;t warned</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.739" end="00:28:28.989" style="s2">himself about himself he&#39;s owned</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.109" end="00:28:30.639" style="s2">Stalinism yeah well then he was in a</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.989" end="00:28:32.559" style="s2">hurry he was sort of half still and</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.639" end="00:28:36.129" style="s2">wasn&#39;t he he had that dud you know I</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.559" end="00:28:38.200" style="s2">mean he was in a hurry yeah he one of</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.129" end="00:28:39.909" style="s2">the Communist society so badly wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.200" end="00:28:41.349" style="s2">happen in Russia but Russia wasn&#39;t ready</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.909" end="00:28:43.979" style="s2">for it there was no way was ready for</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.349" end="00:28:46.720" style="s2">them certainly not China in 1949 either</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.979" end="00:28:48.549" style="s2">that&#39;s why these sort of the Communists</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.720" end="00:28:51.940" style="s2">and was seen China today is a parody of</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.549" end="00:28:53.529" style="s2">communism mmm-hmm it&#39;s little scream ISM</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.940" end="00:28:56.529" style="s2">everywhere is a parody of communism</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.529" end="00:28:58.989" style="s2">isn&#39;t it communism hasn&#39;t existed yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.529" end="00:29:00.940" style="s2">but we allow Christians to say that</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.989" end="00:29:03.190" style="s2">Jesus has not returned yet obviously</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.940" end="00:29:04.899" style="s2">hasn&#39;t but why do we claim the communist</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.190" end="00:29:07.720" style="s2">mess arrived anywhere when it hasn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.899" end="00:29:10.299" style="s2">clearly has not read Karl Marx communism</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.720" end="00:29:14.859" style="s2">has not happened and it&#39;s still the</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.299" end="00:29:16.509" style="s2">world for the full completion but know</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.859" end="00:29:18.960" style="s2">it what the critique would be that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.509" end="00:29:21.190" style="s2">promoting violent revolution I mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.960" end="00:29:25.090" style="s2">that&#39;s not how it happens either is it</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.190" end="00:29:26.859" style="s2">or the critique is very simple if you</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.090" end="00:29:28.179" style="s2">don&#39;t have a name for where you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.859" end="00:29:31.299" style="s2">where the fuck are you going</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.179" end="00:29:34.299" style="s2">an American capitalist individual has no</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.299" end="00:29:37.389" style="s2">idea where he&#39;s heading he is Joker he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.299" end="00:29:39.669" style="s2">a self-obsessed little brat was no idea</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.389" end="00:29:41.320" style="s2">where he&#39;s going I&#39;m tired of American</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.669" end="00:29:44.769" style="s2">capitalist and American individualism</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.320" end="00:29:47.049" style="s2">okay that&#39;s one except those they ride</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.769" end="00:29:48.849" style="s2">nowhere the other extreme as I was</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.049" end="00:29:50.229" style="s2">reading about the Bolsheviks and and and</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.849" end="00:29:51.789" style="s2">and the Red Terror and they really</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.229" end="00:29:53.349" style="s2">wanted they really really going</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.789" end="00:29:56.429" style="s2">somewhere they wanted to destroy</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.349" end="00:29:58.989" style="s2">everybody who was a Kulak and you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.429" end="00:30:00.759" style="s2">everybody everybody and their children</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.989" end="00:30:02.590" style="s2">who was associated with the class they</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.759" end="00:30:06.099" style="s2">wanted to destroy this class and</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.590" end="00:30:07.629" style="s2">obviously I mean I told you what&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.099" end="00:30:11.679" style="s2">call it that is called it&#39;s called fake</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.629" end="00:30:13.059" style="s2">fellas okay it&#39;s fake yeah why would you</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.679" end="00:30:14.950" style="s2">need to kill about it what do you do</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.059" end="00:30:17.290" style="s2">when you do a proper Exodus you leave a</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.950" end="00:30:19.090" style="s2">territory and walk into new one and</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.290" end="00:30:20.800" style="s2">you tell the guys to leave on you can</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.090" end="00:30:22.510" style="s2">explain her you can your main Egyptians</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.800" end="00:30:25.090" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to be Hebrews but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.510" end="00:30:28.840" style="s2">leaving that&#39;s why the Exodus were</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.090" end="00:30:32.890" style="s2">formulating in our next book is so very</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.840" end="00:30:34.900" style="s2">much an exodus it&#39;s about this this is a</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.890" end="00:30:38.590" style="s2">possible future for mankind</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.900" end="00:30:40.420" style="s2">hmm are you up to it okay I&#39;m all for</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.590" end="00:30:42.430" style="s2">that right I love that that&#39;s great um</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.420" end="00:30:43.840" style="s2">but I don&#39;t feel that in Marx Marx</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.430" end="00:30:46.510" style="s2">doesn&#39;t use that kind of language he</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.840" end="00:30:48.610" style="s2">doesn&#39;t go that deep he he doesn&#39;t talk</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.510" end="00:30:52.450" style="s2">about the Exodus he talks about the</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.610" end="00:30:53.860" style="s2">class right only so yeah sure but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.450" end="00:30:55.780" style="s2">not saying Marx is the finished version</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.860" end="00:30:58.720" style="s2">of anything I think we need to revisit</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.780" end="00:31:01.840" style="s2">Marx we need to reconquer the word</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.720" end="00:31:04.330" style="s2">communism I&#39;m not a socialist I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.840" end="00:31:05.800" style="s2">communist communism is simply I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.330" end="00:31:08.050" style="s2">communist simply because that is the</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.800" end="00:31:10.930" style="s2">proper response to what optimism and</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.050" end="00:31:11.290" style="s2">individualism have become we become dead</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.930" end="00:31:14.080" style="s2">ends</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.290" end="00:31:16.660" style="s2">so you creating material abundance by</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.080" end="00:31:18.190" style="s2">exploiting a planet wealth you created</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.660" end="00:31:18.670" style="s2">the bomb that can blow us up at any</p>

<p begin="00:31:18.670" end="00:31:23.080" style="s2">yeah all of this is the result of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.860" end="00:31:26.320" style="s2">system we&#39;ve had on this secularization</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.080" end="00:31:28.900" style="s2">of the planet it was the eighth system</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.320" end="00:31:31.570" style="s2">of a fucking week Obama nobody else they</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.900" end="00:31:34.030" style="s2">should be going for it so now we&#39;ve got</p>

<p begin="00:34:27.630" end="00:34:31.919" style="s2">hmm and it&#39;s also a way of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.030" end="00:34:34.020" style="s2">these religions were developed along</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.919" end="00:34:37.450" style="s2">trade routes that&#39;s why they so great</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.020" end="00:34:38.950" style="s2">today to study today and from</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.450" end="00:34:41.049" style="s2">if they were developed along the trade</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.950" end="00:34:44.740" style="s2">routes that means they were tolerant of</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.049" end="00:34:46.809" style="s2">other ideas they include also thought</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.740" end="00:34:48.399" style="s2">really they were a structure called</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.809" end="00:34:50.079" style="s2">schools of thought along the way</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.399" end="00:34:51.250" style="s2">scissors along the trade routes we built</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.079" end="00:34:52.839" style="s2">their only whorehouse in the bathhouse</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.250" end="00:34:55.210" style="s2">as we also build school so thought</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.839" end="00:34:56.740" style="s2">because of he schools these schools of</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.210" end="00:34:58.750" style="s2">thought or what I call the Silk Road</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.740" end="00:35:01.270" style="s2">tried these are the religions of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.750" end="00:35:03.609" style="s2">east these are the mr. systems and the</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.270" end="00:35:04.900" style="s2">wisdoms of the East we can learn a lot</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.609" end="00:35:06.520" style="s2">from him and the reason why they were</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.900" end="00:35:10.000" style="s2">all monist was because they all</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.520" end="00:35:13.690" style="s2">influenced one another mm-hmm it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.000" end="00:35:15.640" style="s2">rich rich diverse this brings us back to</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.690" end="00:35:17.950" style="s2">the cause of my pole what you would call</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.640" end="00:35:21.040" style="s2">the cosmic yeah yeah because if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.950" end="00:35:23.680" style="s2">developed trading or if you&#39;re a priest</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.040" end="00:35:25.780" style="s2">to build a rittle place you come in from</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.680" end="00:35:27.549" style="s2">two different ends I&#39;m beginning more</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.780" end="00:35:29.530" style="s2">and more to think that ritual places did</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.549" end="00:35:31.180" style="s2">not originate before trading started and</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.530" end="00:35:33.339" style="s2">trading was a byproduct of rituals I</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.180" end="00:35:35.349" style="s2">rather think they Co develops I think I</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.339" end="00:35:38.250" style="s2">think the I think the priests leaving</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.349" end="00:35:40.690" style="s2">your co-develop things and I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.250" end="00:35:42.420" style="s2">priests engineer trader you got the</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.690" end="00:35:45.640" style="s2">three different ones here they proudly</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.420" end="00:35:47.890" style="s2">co-develop so if you look at say</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.640" end="00:35:49.030" style="s2">Kyrgyzstan is the origin of civilization</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.890" end="00:35:53.230" style="s2">or something like that which the problem</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.030" end="00:35:55.930" style="s2">is you probably see that all language is</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.230" end="00:35:57.490" style="s2">a communication tool use written</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.930" end="00:36:00.130" style="s2">language the communication tool they use</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.490" end="00:36:02.290" style="s2">to both store information and accumulate</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.130" end="00:36:05.079" style="s2">information and use that information to</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.290" end="00:36:07.780" style="s2">build more complex structures mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.079" end="00:36:09.720" style="s2">that develops into written religion that</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.780" end="00:36:11.410" style="s2">develops into architecture of</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.720" end="00:36:13.359" style="s2">engineering and that develops</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.410" end="00:36:14.500" style="s2">infiltrating and craving a certain</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.359" end="00:36:16.390" style="s2">something what requires a weakened</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.500" end="00:36:18.640" style="s2">language because you cannot have trade</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.390" end="00:36:20.349" style="s2">without Diaries and spitting is very</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.640" end="00:36:22.359" style="s2">phallic also isn&#39;t it it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.349" end="00:36:25.780" style="s2">masculine activity isn&#39;t it&#39;s like</p>

<p begin="00:36:25.780" end="00:36:30.280" style="s2">trade with one another to come back to</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.180" end="00:36:32.130" style="s2">our women with some kind of an increased</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.280" end="00:36:36.640" style="s2">abundance to impress them even more</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.130" end="00:36:39.359" style="s2">mm-hmm yeah so yeah trade trade would be</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.640" end="00:36:42.549" style="s2">very important also in this in the</p>

<p begin="00:38:22.999" end="00:38:27.890" style="s2">so space-time started out of it and out</p>

<p begin="00:38:27.890" end="00:38:33.109" style="s2">comes what physics later you know for a</p>

<p begin="00:38:38.089" end="00:38:42.819" style="s2">that we live on a couple of million</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.220" end="00:38:44.809" style="s2">years ago out of chemistry came biology</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.819" end="00:38:47.720" style="s2">the first life-forms</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.809" end="00:38:48.710" style="s2">suddenly exist they just suddenly exist</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.720" end="00:38:51.019" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.710" end="00:38:52.670" style="s2">they obviously exist meaning that</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.019" end="00:38:54.410" style="s2">emerges on something we have to question</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.670" end="00:38:56.210" style="s2">itself we have to study what an</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.410" end="00:38:58.759" style="s2">emergence is are there similarities</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.210" end="00:39:00.859" style="s2">between the origin of biology the origin</p>

<p begin="00:39:03.420" end="00:39:09.840" style="s2">share something something similar with</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.140" end="00:39:11.250" style="s2">them well to begin with I would say that</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.840" end="00:39:12.960" style="s2">I propose that there has to be time</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.250" end="00:39:16.080" style="s2">dimension and added tongue dimension</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.960" end="00:39:17.670" style="s2">called global time or hyper time and</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.080" end="00:39:19.920" style="s2">that hyper time is basically the time</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.670" end="00:39:22.050" style="s2">that existed before the Big Bounce so if</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.920" end="00:39:23.880" style="s2">the universe sort of imploded collapsed</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.050" end="00:39:26.220" style="s2">and then a new universe came out of it</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.880" end="00:39:27.780" style="s2">the new universe had a new specific time</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.220" end="00:39:28.560" style="s2">that we called space-time and space</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.780" end="00:39:30.840" style="s2">included in it</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.560" end="00:39:32.160" style="s2">that&#39;s Einsteinian spacetime but that</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.840" end="00:39:33.510" style="s2">would have been a time before that too</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.160" end="00:39:35.160" style="s2">because otherwise required even think of</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.510" end="00:39:37.020" style="s2">it you just call that hyper horn but</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.160" end="00:39:40.500" style="s2">then you have to time Domitius why let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.020" end="00:39:43.560" style="s2">go to then we can set along the hyper</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.500" end="00:39:45.720" style="s2">time axis we can discuss history along</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.560" end="00:39:47.820" style="s2">the hyper time axis then we can sort of</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.720" end="00:39:49.920" style="s2">neutralized emergencies it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.820" end="00:39:51.480" style="s2">physics is more important than chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.920" end="00:39:54.210" style="s2">or chemists needs more in portable</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.480" end="00:39:56.100" style="s2">biology even if one is conditional on</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.210" end="00:39:57.870" style="s2">the other one the fact that a certain</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.100" end="00:39:59.670" style="s2">emergence has to exist first before</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.870" end="00:40:00.990" style="s2">another mergers can exist doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.670" end="00:40:03.870" style="s2">necessarily mean that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.990" end="00:40:06.060" style="s2">priority between them oh there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.870" end="00:40:09.810" style="s2">necessarily better than younger mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.060" end="00:40:14.700" style="s2">if you realize that you can create an</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.810" end="00:40:16.950" style="s2">idea of each emergence being a vector so</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.700" end="00:40:20.610" style="s2">whenever the very first life form</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.950" end="00:40:23.730" style="s2">existed and new emerges was there life</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.610" end="00:40:25.830" style="s2">biology out of that you create a vector</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.730" end="00:40:27.570" style="s2">that means biological life in whatever</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.830" end="00:40:29.660" style="s2">form it has taken anywhere in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.570" end="00:40:32.100" style="s2">universe starts from that emergence and</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.660" end="00:40:34.590" style="s2">emergence vector or biology is the</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.100" end="00:40:36.600" style="s2">result then you can just study biology</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.590" end="00:40:39.090" style="s2">separately from the physics or chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.600" end="00:40:41.790" style="s2">or work philosophy would you like you</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.090" end="00:40:44.070" style="s2">can study biology on its own you can</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.790" end="00:40:46.830" style="s2">make comparative studies you can for</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.070" end="00:40:49.950" style="s2">example study exiting biology and you</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.830" end="00:40:52.140" style="s2">can study complexity physics and lets it</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.950" end="00:40:53.820" style="s2">implement separate from one another and</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.140" end="00:40:55.170" style="s2">then compare them so you can learn from</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.820" end="00:40:58.680" style="s2">one another you can also see where</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.170" end="00:41:00.990" style="s2">they&#39;re different okay so that means</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.680" end="00:41:03.090" style="s2">there are no laws of nature in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.990" end="00:41:05.340" style="s2">of laws of nature exists before anything</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.090" end="00:41:07.200" style="s2">else exists mm-hmm there are no such</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.340" end="00:41:09.060" style="s2">laws there are only relationships power</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.200" end="00:41:11.490" style="s2">relationships and and a possible</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.060" end="00:41:14.130" style="s2">influences and in these forces that</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.490" end="00:41:16.200" style="s2">exist in the universe our date-date</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.130" end="00:41:18.690" style="s2">suddenly develop we</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.200" end="00:41:21.180" style="s2">urghhh it means what we have to deal</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.690" end="00:41:23.550" style="s2">with our habits of nature and if you</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.180" end="00:41:26.099" style="s2">have a certain state of some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.550" end="00:41:27.930" style="s2">tensed pretty permanent over time so you</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.099" end="00:41:29.880" style="s2">have a similar temperature of a time</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.930" end="00:41:31.650" style="s2">like you haven&#39;t planet Earth then</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.880" end="00:41:33.000" style="s2">certainly it&#39;s can occur on that planet</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.650" end="00:41:35.400" style="s2">that probably will not occur anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.000" end="00:41:37.589" style="s2">else that that that that is a</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.400" end="00:41:40.109" style="s2">consequence of that happening but he</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.589" end="00:41:43.020" style="s2">wasn&#39;t it wasn&#39;t bound up or anything</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.109" end="00:41:44.520" style="s2">like that before it happened it still</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.020" end="00:41:46.980" style="s2">makes it very difficult but then you</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.520" end="00:41:49.079" style="s2">realize it&#39;s 30 different emergencies in</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.980" end="00:41:50.730" style="s2">a comparative fashion but you cannot</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.079" end="00:41:53.010" style="s2">draw the conclusion when one emerge</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.730" end="00:41:55.290" style="s2">doesn&#39;t that apply to the other one the</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.010" end="00:41:57.599" style="s2">emergence of biology might operate very</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.290" end="00:41:59.490" style="s2">differently from emergence physics the</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.599" end="00:42:01.770" style="s2">only thing you can be sure of is that</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.490" end="00:42:06.329" style="s2">it&#39;s radically different from the</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.770" end="00:42:08.609" style="s2">emergency chimera mmm so it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.329" end="00:42:11.760" style="s2">like so you study study these things not</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.609" end="00:42:13.859" style="s2">to conflate them or or exactly Scimitar</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.760" end="00:42:16.410" style="s2">turn them into platonic ideals or</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.859" end="00:42:17.579" style="s2">whatever the way you do that is that you</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.410" end="00:42:20.700" style="s2">say an emergence is not a phase</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.579" end="00:42:22.650" style="s2">transition mm-hmm because a phase</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.700" end="00:42:25.710" style="s2">transition is like that that applies to</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.650" end="00:42:28.200" style="s2">a constant say that well you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.710" end="00:42:30.510" style="s2">there&#39;s water and water comes as guess</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.200" end="00:42:33.810" style="s2">and it comes as liquid then he comes his</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.510" end="00:42:36.089" style="s2">eyes yeah depending on depending on the</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.810" end="00:42:37.710" style="s2">circumstances water we react differently</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.089" end="00:42:39.420" style="s2">the same water molecule will act</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.710" end="00:42:42.720" style="s2">differently but it will also react in</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.420" end="00:42:45.660" style="s2">both directions so it&#39;s symmetric hmm</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.720" end="00:42:47.910" style="s2">the thing about mergers though is that</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.660" end="00:42:48.750" style="s2">they tend to be a symmetric happened</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.910" end="00:42:50.369" style="s2">only once</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.750" end="00:42:52.230" style="s2">suddenly they change the rules for</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.369" end="00:42:54.270" style="s2">everything and within the vector they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.230" end="00:42:55.650" style="s2">creating things behave in a very</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.270" end="00:42:59.579" style="s2">different manner from anything you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.650" end="00:43:01.109" style="s2">been a you observed before so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.579" end="00:43:02.430" style="s2">lot of thinkers out the terrace Deacon</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.109" end="00:43:04.619" style="s2">is what I&#39;m studying at the moment who</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.430" end="00:43:06.599" style="s2">doing emerges theory and taking it very</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.619" end="00:43:08.520" style="s2">seriously the fact that emergence exists</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.599" end="00:43:10.140" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean we understand it but if you</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.520" end="00:43:12.780" style="s2">can understand what emerges is we can</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.140" end="00:43:15.599" style="s2">work with it now the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.780" end="00:43:19.410" style="s2">emergence has become a buzzword for</p>

<p begin="00:46:53.720" end="00:46:57.980" style="s2">cannot a nuclear power is an idiot it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.150" end="00:47:01.069" style="s2">a typical metrical reaction without</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.980" end="00:47:02.960" style="s2">Fallot the phallic and reaction is that</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.069" end="00:47:05.960" style="s2">nuclear power can be contained and used</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.960" end="00:47:07.700" style="s2">to create enormous amounts abundance of</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.960" end="00:47:10.339" style="s2">cheap electricity which is what the</p>

<p begin="00:47:15.109" end="00:47:19.520" style="s2">of the day then we can put incentives</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.869" end="00:47:22.549" style="s2">out there everywhere to contain the</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.520" end="00:47:24.740" style="s2">climate control requirement and if you</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.549" end="00:47:28.670" style="s2">can domesticate the climate we can</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.740" end="00:47:30.290" style="s2">cultivate the entire planet mm-hmm</p>

<p begin="00:47:33.890" end="00:47:39.799" style="s2">and then we have to portray ourselves as</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.000" end="00:47:42.650" style="s2">in a faculty man you would say the tribe</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.799" end="00:47:45.740" style="s2">has to become a work of art so the</p>

<p begin="00:47:45.740" end="00:47:49.880" style="s2">as a forthcoming work of art ok that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.740" end="00:47:52.850" style="s2">the other side I meant</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.880" end="00:47:56.060" style="s2">this experimentalism read in a constant</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.850" end="00:47:58.640" style="s2">state of fresh renewal not striving</p>
