<p begin="00:00:06.299" end="00:00:11.200" style="s2">what we wanted to do is give everyone a</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.680" end="00:00:12.940" style="s2">little bit of context into the speakers</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.200" end="00:00:15.490" style="s2">so Bret Weinstein and they&#39;re hiring</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.940" end="00:00:16.750" style="s2">here McGilchrist Jordan green hole a</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.490" end="00:00:19.330" style="s2">little bit of background to their</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.750" end="00:00:21.460" style="s2">thought as preparation for the summit</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.330" end="00:00:23.890" style="s2">and also talked a little bit about what</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.460" end="00:00:25.329" style="s2">the summit is and what it entails for</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.890" end="00:00:28.329" style="s2">you as a participant because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.329" end="00:00:30.640" style="s2">the regular kind of talk where we might</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.329" end="00:00:32.739" style="s2">go and listen to someone at the summit</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.640" end="00:00:34.060" style="s2">everyone&#39;s a participant and in a</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.739" end="00:00:35.649" style="s2">particular way which we&#39;re going to talk</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.060" end="00:00:37.720" style="s2">about in a bit more detail so rebel</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.649" end="00:00:41.170" style="s2">wisdom the media channel has existed for</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.720" end="00:00:42.730" style="s2">a bit over a year now and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.170" end="00:00:44.590" style="s2">things that many of the people we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.730" end="00:00:47.710" style="s2">interviewed have in common and certainly</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.590" end="00:00:49.900" style="s2">the four speakers who we have coming to</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.710" end="00:00:51.930" style="s2">the summit is this idea that we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.900" end="00:00:55.870" style="s2">the middle of a sense making crisis and</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.930" end="00:00:58.810" style="s2">the the mission of rebel wisdom is very</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.870" end="00:01:01.420" style="s2">much how do we make sense of the sense</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.810" end="00:01:05.740" style="s2">making crisis if that&#39;s not to matter</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.420" end="00:01:07.180" style="s2">already and that sense making crisis</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.740" end="00:01:10.120" style="s2">takes many different forms and</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.180" end="00:01:13.360" style="s2">definitely a big part of that is this</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.120" end="00:01:14.470" style="s2">shift from broadcast to digital and also</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.360" end="00:01:15.970" style="s2">the kind of the increased polarization</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.470" end="00:01:18.460" style="s2">that we&#39;re definitely seeing through</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.970" end="00:01:19.990" style="s2">social media and this kind of feeling</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.460" end="00:01:21.310" style="s2">that we all have of being pushed and</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.990" end="00:01:24.040" style="s2">further and further into very</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.310" end="00:01:25.270" style="s2">ideological camps and how that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.040" end="00:01:27.880" style="s2">increased and how it&#39;s much more</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.270" end="00:01:31.510" style="s2">difficult to have conversations across</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.880" end="00:01:34.479" style="s2">those divides and so a real world event</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.510" end="00:01:36.640" style="s2">is a really important part of how do we</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.479" end="00:01:39.340" style="s2">model those conversations those</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.640" end="00:01:40.659" style="s2">generative conversations and we&#39;ll talk</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.340" end="00:01:41.860" style="s2">a bit more about that and even there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.659" end="00:01:43.330" style="s2">sort of physiology of that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.860" end="00:01:46.690" style="s2">generative conversation later in this</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.330" end="00:01:48.760" style="s2">film but what&#39;s clearly necessary is</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.690" end="00:01:50.770" style="s2">that we are able to enter into</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.760" end="00:01:52.900" style="s2">generative dialogue with each other</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.770" end="00:01:55.420" style="s2">where we&#39;re not just broadcasting what</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.900" end="00:01:57.070" style="s2">we think at each other we are having a</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.420" end="00:01:59.290" style="s2">conversation that can build on itself</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.070" end="00:02:00.930" style="s2">and that&#39;s why we&#39;ve invited the four</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.290" end="00:02:04.119" style="s2">people that we have to the summit</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.930" end="00:02:05.380" style="s2">because we we were very impressed with</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.119" end="00:02:06.610" style="s2">when we interviewed them and we know</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.380" end="00:02:10.629" style="s2">that they&#39;re able to enter into that</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.610" end="00:02:13.299" style="s2">space and so very quickly introducing</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.629" end="00:02:15.190" style="s2">them so firstly Bret Weinstein and</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.299" end="00:02:17.470" style="s2">Heather huiying Bret and Heather are</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.190" end="00:02:19.090" style="s2">both evolutionary biologists they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.470" end="00:02:21.489" style="s2">also husband and wife</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.090" end="00:02:24.190" style="s2">and they were both teaching in the same</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.489" end="00:02:27.580" style="s2">College Evergreen in the u.s. up until</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.190" end="00:02:29.230" style="s2">just over a year ago and famously and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.580" end="00:02:30.640" style="s2">say famous if you don&#39;t know their</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.230" end="00:02:33.160" style="s2">history and evergreen we&#39;re going to put</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.640" end="00:02:35.590" style="s2">a couple of links in the show notes</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.160" end="00:02:38.349" style="s2">below this that you can watch and get a</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.590" end="00:02:40.269" style="s2">bit of a background but they famously</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.349" end="00:02:43.930" style="s2">had this run-in with student activists</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.269" end="00:02:46.209" style="s2">in Evergreen and had to leave but what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.930" end="00:02:48.819" style="s2">really fascinating is that they were</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.209" end="00:02:53.049" style="s2">teaching evolutionary biology some of</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.819" end="00:02:54.910" style="s2">the most difficult hot-button topics</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.049" end="00:02:57.730" style="s2">right now in the media about sort of sex</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.910" end="00:02:59.739" style="s2">differences between men and women in one</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.730" end="00:03:02.500" style="s2">of the most progressive colleges in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.739" end="00:03:06.670" style="s2">country and so have a huge amount of</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.500" end="00:03:10.170" style="s2">experience of teaching tricky difficult</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.670" end="00:03:12.849" style="s2">topics in environments where that can be</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.170" end="00:03:16.930" style="s2">misinterpreted there are tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.849" end="00:03:20.640" style="s2">lessons and the key to what Heather and</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.930" end="00:03:26.049" style="s2">I were doing was that we started out by</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.640" end="00:03:27.790" style="s2">engineering a community that was safe to</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.049" end="00:03:29.769" style="s2">have discussions and discussions that</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.790" end="00:03:31.959" style="s2">were we to take what was said in our</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.769" end="00:03:33.430" style="s2">classroom and to import it into a</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.959" end="00:03:36.970" style="s2">faculty meeting would have caused a</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.430" end="00:03:41.910" style="s2">conflagration for sure but you have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.970" end="00:03:44.799" style="s2">group of students it&#39;s a question of</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.910" end="00:03:46.239" style="s2">broadening their worldview so that they</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.799" end="00:03:47.859" style="s2">can understand that all of the things</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.239" end="00:03:51.310" style="s2">that they know they care about all of</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.859" end="00:03:53.230" style="s2">the things that they find fun to do all</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.310" end="00:03:55.780" style="s2">of the pursuits that drive them their</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.230" end="00:03:57.489" style="s2">their loves their passions that all of</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.780" end="00:03:59.500" style="s2">these things are products of evolution</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.489" end="00:04:02.459" style="s2">and that means that understanding</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.500" end="00:04:05.769" style="s2">evolution provides a kind of roadmap</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.459" end="00:04:08.470" style="s2">against the inner confusion that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.769" end="00:04:11.169" style="s2">very powerful incentive for people to</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.470" end="00:04:14.440" style="s2">embrace it so the answer to your</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.169" end="00:04:16.780" style="s2">question is you provide the safety to</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.440" end="00:04:19.060" style="s2">explore where people quickly get the</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.780" end="00:04:20.530" style="s2">idea that they are not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.060" end="00:04:23.590" style="s2">backed against the wall for saying</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.530" end="00:04:26.680" style="s2">something that sounds radical or off and</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.590" end="00:04:28.390" style="s2">then there&#39;s the incentive to have the</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.680" end="00:04:30.610" style="s2">conversation which comes from the fact</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.390" end="00:04:32.620" style="s2">that you get something positive for it</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.610" end="00:04:34.690" style="s2">you know to understand</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.620" end="00:04:37.450" style="s2">yourself to understand why people</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.690" end="00:04:40.090" style="s2">interact in the way they do is a very</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.450" end="00:04:43.240" style="s2">powerful advantage and if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.090" end="00:04:46.330" style="s2">presented with the question of would you</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.240" end="00:04:47.980" style="s2">like to endure some discomfort in order</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.330" end="00:04:50.889" style="s2">to have the power to understand your own</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.980" end="00:04:52.570" style="s2">life almost everybody will say yes we</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.889" end="00:04:57.010" style="s2">were able to talk about difficult</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.570" end="00:04:58.630" style="s2">subjects pretty easily right we and you</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.010" end="00:05:00.910" style="s2">know in some ways it was what students</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.630" end="00:05:02.919" style="s2">were signing up for you know I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.910" end="00:05:05.260" style="s2">the two kinds of programs that I did</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.919" end="00:05:07.720" style="s2">most were vertebrate evolution which was</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.260" end="00:05:09.280" style="s2">not did not fear too much into</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.720" end="00:05:11.139" style="s2">politically dangerous territory but an</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.280" end="00:05:13.060" style="s2">will behavior is rife with it you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.139" end="00:05:15.310" style="s2">you can&#39;t you can&#39;t not go there if you</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.060" end="00:05:18.160" style="s2">want to do it honestly and so talking</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.310" end="00:05:20.020" style="s2">about and you know and humans are</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.160" end="00:05:22.060" style="s2">animals so we didn&#39;t we didn&#39;t fear from</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.020" end="00:05:23.620" style="s2">humans and in fact all of the seminars</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.060" end="00:05:25.600" style="s2">that I tend to do in those programs were</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.620" end="00:05:28.870" style="s2">specifically on humans on human</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.600" end="00:05:33.630" style="s2">evolution readings what our history has</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.870" end="00:05:36.220" style="s2">looked like mostly our prehistory and</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.630" end="00:05:37.840" style="s2">frankly students especially from</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.220" end="00:05:40.570" style="s2">historically marginalized and oppressed</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.840" end="00:05:43.120" style="s2">groups were particularly interested</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.570" end="00:05:44.950" style="s2">several several people told me nearly</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.120" end="00:05:46.630" style="s2">every year I thought this material but</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.950" end="00:05:50.200" style="s2">they&#39;re particularly interested to</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.630" end="00:05:53.770" style="s2">finally get a read on what it was that</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.200" end="00:05:56.650" style="s2">evolution had to say about about being</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.770" end="00:05:58.090" style="s2">gay or about different races or about</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.650" end="00:06:01.600" style="s2">especially any Oh in my case I would</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.090" end="00:06:04.000" style="s2">teach a lot on sex and gender and you</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.600" end="00:06:05.320" style="s2">know on what it was to be male versus</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.000" end="00:06:07.300" style="s2">female the next speaker we want to</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.320" end="00:06:08.919" style="s2">introduce is Ian McGilchrist who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.300" end="00:06:11.080" style="s2">definitely one of the most revolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.919" end="00:06:13.150" style="s2">and fascinating thinkers we&#39;ve come</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.080" end="00:06:15.250" style="s2">across since you&#39;ve been doing this so</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.150" end="00:06:16.780" style="s2">here&#39;s a psychiatrist and philosopher he</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.250" end="00:06:20.229" style="s2">wrote a book called the masters emissary</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.780" end="00:06:21.760" style="s2">where he really took a much wider view</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.229" end="00:06:25.090" style="s2">of the left-right brain</p>

<p begin="00:06:26.680" end="00:06:29.530" style="s2">perceive reality but also how it might</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.389" end="00:06:31.630" style="s2">have influenced the development of</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.530" end="00:06:33.669" style="s2">culture as well and I think that is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.630" end="00:06:35.500" style="s2">really fascinating view on the</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.669" end="00:06:38.770" style="s2">sense-making crisis we are not aware</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.500" end="00:06:40.590" style="s2">that our reality is constructed by two</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.770" end="00:06:42.990" style="s2">different systems if you</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.590" end="00:06:45.960" style="s2">we focus on different aspects of reality</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.990" end="00:06:49.440" style="s2">and therefore construe a world with</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.960" end="00:06:52.250" style="s2">different qualities and the first part</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.440" end="00:06:56.010" style="s2">of the book explains that in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.250" end="00:06:58.730" style="s2">neuropsychiatry and philosophy and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.010" end="00:07:03.060" style="s2">second part of the book suggests that in</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.730" end="00:07:05.130" style="s2">the history of the West three times we</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.060" end="00:07:07.980" style="s2">have been in a position where to begin</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.130" end="00:07:11.550" style="s2">with a civilization flourished when it</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.980" end="00:07:12.780" style="s2">kept both these visions together that of</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.550" end="00:07:15.000" style="s2">the right hemisphere and that of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.780" end="00:07:16.440" style="s2">left but then in every case and I</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.000" end="00:07:21.410" style="s2">believe we&#39;re repeating the pattern for</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.440" end="00:07:24.780" style="s2">the third time as the the civilization</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.410" end="00:07:28.080" style="s2">overreached itself and things</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.780" end="00:07:31.169" style="s2">deteriorated and the mindset became more</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.080" end="00:07:33.690" style="s2">rigid more bureaucratic less imaginative</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.169" end="00:07:37.400" style="s2">less flexible less in touch with reality</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.690" end="00:07:39.780" style="s2">and became locked into a way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.400" end="00:07:44.789" style="s2">which is that the left hemisphere which</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.780" end="00:07:48.180" style="s2">is useful it&#39;s not a mistake that we</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.789" end="00:07:50.490" style="s2">have it but it cannot be our way of</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.180" end="00:07:53.850" style="s2">contacting reality a simple way of</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.490" end="00:07:56.910" style="s2">putting it is it&#39;s like mistaking the</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.850" end="00:07:59.430" style="s2">map for the tariff we talk a lot on this</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.910" end="00:08:01.229" style="s2">channel about the meta conversation the</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.430" end="00:08:04.590" style="s2">idea that what we need is a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.229" end="00:08:06.990" style="s2">that opens up to the not knowing to what</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.590" end="00:08:08.789" style="s2">needs to emerge beyond and what it feels</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.990" end="00:08:10.979" style="s2">like is happening now increasingly with</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.789" end="00:08:13.470" style="s2">social media is people are getting stuck</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.979" end="00:08:15.810" style="s2">more and more in certainty and in what</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.470" end="00:08:17.820" style="s2">they do know is that a right-brain</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.810" end="00:08:20.340" style="s2">left-brain phenomena well it can be</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.820" end="00:08:22.530" style="s2">looked at in that way in that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.340" end="00:08:24.930" style="s2">features of the left hemisphere is that</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.530" end="00:08:27.840" style="s2">it prefers what it&#39;s already familiar</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.930" end="00:08:30.120" style="s2">with and it finds it very difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.840" end="00:08:32.400" style="s2">shift set so once it&#39;s stuck into</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.120" end="00:08:33.990" style="s2">something it keeps on repeating it so</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.400" end="00:08:37.349" style="s2">the left hemispheres take is an</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.990" end="00:08:40.610" style="s2">exclusive one either this is right or</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.349" end="00:08:43.589" style="s2">that is right and therefore what I know</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.610" end="00:08:45.870" style="s2">excludes what you know whereas the right</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.589" end="00:08:48.270" style="s2">hemispheres take is a both and to take</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.870" end="00:08:50.190" style="s2">that there&#39;s a room for what the left</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.270" end="00:08:53.150" style="s2">hemisphere does there&#39;s a point in</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.190" end="00:08:56.459" style="s2">analysis but there&#39;s also a point in</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.150" end="00:08:59.400" style="s2">synthesis and imagination and what we</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.459" end="00:09:02.700" style="s2">are desperately lacking is is that</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.400" end="00:09:05.010" style="s2">overall synthesis it seems to me that at</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.700" end="00:09:09.030" style="s2">the moment we officially pride ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.010" end="00:09:10.440" style="s2">on being a very free thinking people I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.030" end="00:09:14.100" style="s2">going to sound like a terrible Friday</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.440" end="00:09:18.780" style="s2">Daddy but I think the intellectual world</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.100" end="00:09:21.209" style="s2">was far more open in the 60s and 70s</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.780" end="00:09:23.900" style="s2">when I grew up than it is today it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.209" end="00:09:26.160" style="s2">closed down to a number of dogmas and</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.900" end="00:09:28.860" style="s2">the Internet which is a wonderful thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.160" end="00:09:30.930" style="s2">hasn&#39;t helped because it&#39;s possible for</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.860" end="00:09:32.760" style="s2">people to get trapped in bubbles where</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.930" end="00:09:35.490" style="s2">they reinforce the things they believe</p>

<p begin="00:09:38.310" end="00:09:43.050" style="s2">green Hall Jordan is kind of difficult</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.370" end="00:09:47.880" style="s2">to define I guess you probably call him</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.050" end="00:09:50.070" style="s2">a futurist writer he wrote a piece that</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.880" end="00:09:53.010" style="s2">went pretty viral after the Trump</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.070" end="00:09:55.530" style="s2">election called deep code situational</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.010" end="00:09:57.390" style="s2">assessment in which he basically kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.530" end="00:09:59.040" style="s2">said this is what I think&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.390" end="00:10:01.079" style="s2">with the Trump election and this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.040" end="00:10:02.850" style="s2">what&#39;s likely to happen next and he</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.079" end="00:10:05.010" style="s2">introduced a whole load of concepts that</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.850" end="00:10:07.920" style="s2">we found incredibly helpful to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.010" end="00:10:11.760" style="s2">make sense of the world the insurgency</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.920" end="00:10:13.490" style="s2">the the blue church and he talked a lot</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.760" end="00:10:15.720" style="s2">about how we&#39;re moving from like a</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.490" end="00:10:18.329" style="s2">broadcast modality in many different</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.720" end="00:10:20.550" style="s2">areas of life where one speaks and</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.329" end="00:10:23.010" style="s2">others listen to a networked digital</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.550" end="00:10:26.160" style="s2">modality and what that means for society</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.010" end="00:10:28.860" style="s2">and the idea of the blue church being</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.160" end="00:10:30.120" style="s2">this kind of this framework that had</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.860" end="00:10:31.829" style="s2">taken us through from probably the</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.120" end="00:10:34.110" style="s2">second world war on woods and was now</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.829" end="00:10:35.880" style="s2">breaking down and all of the media</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.110" end="00:10:37.530" style="s2">institutions and a lot of our kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.880" end="00:10:39.959" style="s2">academic institutions are part of this</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.530" end="00:10:42.060" style="s2">blue church concept but if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.959" end="00:10:43.890" style="s2">breaking down what happens and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.060" end="00:10:47.579" style="s2">likely to happen next and it is</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.890" end="00:10:56.280" style="s2">certainly the case that in this in this</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.579" end="00:10:59.570" style="s2">moment in order to speak honestly</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.280" end="00:10:59.570" style="s2">requires courage</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.600" end="00:11:08.770" style="s2">and I was gonna say in particular when</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.580" end="00:11:10.840" style="s2">we have to say is not that which is in</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.770" end="00:11:12.520" style="s2">alignment with good opinion but oddly</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.840" end="00:11:14.410" style="s2">enough I think it&#39;s even when it is in a</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.520" end="00:11:16.780" style="s2">line with a good opinion because I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.410" end="00:11:21.790" style="s2">there&#39;s something in the ambient</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.780" end="00:11:23.410" style="s2">environment that feels honesty as a as a</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.790" end="00:11:27.280" style="s2">bad thing in and of itself</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.410" end="00:11:30.250" style="s2">I almost a a complicity to always be</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.280" end="00:11:32.140" style="s2">ever so slightly ironic and never be</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.250" end="00:11:35.710" style="s2">fully connected to trying to speak</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.140" end="00:11:38.200" style="s2">honestly but at the same time human</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.710" end="00:11:40.090" style="s2">beings have evolved in fact I won&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.200" end="00:11:42.520" style="s2">say it&#39;s the essence of what we are that</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.090" end="00:11:47.910" style="s2">differentiates us from our premia</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.520" end="00:11:47.910" style="s2">ancestors to be very very attracted to</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.300" end="00:11:58.750" style="s2">honest insightful expression oftentimes</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.370" end="00:12:02.080" style="s2">in history we&#39;ve needed that something</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.750" end="00:12:02.500" style="s2">to make it and the situation was not</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.080" end="00:12:04.900" style="s2">easy</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.500" end="00:12:08.260" style="s2">the situation was complex challenging</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.900" end="00:12:10.930" style="s2">and so it required that something that</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.260" end="00:12:15.130" style="s2">whatever it is that happens when we are</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.930" end="00:12:16.750" style="s2">gathered together in a space of well</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.130" end="00:12:24.640" style="s2">collaboration let&#39;s just make it again</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.750" end="00:12:27.910" style="s2">very simple a space of peace a space of</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.640" end="00:12:30.760" style="s2">mutual understanding not for the purpose</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.910" end="00:12:34.180" style="s2">of delivering on the same opinion but</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.760" end="00:12:36.880" style="s2">really for going deep and trying to find</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.180" end="00:12:42.850" style="s2">something which is trying to frankly</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.880" end="00:12:44.440" style="s2">express itself like to listen and so if</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.850" end="00:12:47.860" style="s2">that story the story that is told is</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.440" end="00:12:49.390" style="s2">true then it would be in our bones it</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.860" end="00:12:50.710" style="s2">would be in our deepest mythology and</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.390" end="00:12:53.740" style="s2">our deepest traditions I do this</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.710" end="00:12:59.140" style="s2">religion that this is the place to go</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.740" end="00:13:01.990" style="s2">that when trouble is brewing gather</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.140" end="00:13:04.210" style="s2">together answer into this space this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.990" end="00:13:05.380" style="s2">where we do these sorts of things this</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.210" end="00:13:07.720" style="s2">is how we solve these kinds of problems</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.380" end="00:13:09.040" style="s2">so those are our four speakers and now</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.720" end="00:13:10.270" style="s2">we want to talk a little bit about what</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.040" end="00:13:11.620" style="s2">we&#39;re actually going to be doing at the</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.270" end="00:13:13.770" style="s2">summit and how we&#39;re going to be doing</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.620" end="00:13:15.670" style="s2">it which is probably more important</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.770" end="00:13:16.630" style="s2">we&#39;ve been doing events like this for</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.670" end="00:13:18.190" style="s2">about a year now</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.630" end="00:13:19.660" style="s2">on a smaller scale so we</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.190" end="00:13:21.720" style="s2">evening events where we&#39;ve had a speaker</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.660" end="00:13:24.760" style="s2">and then we&#39;ve broken off into groups to</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.720" end="00:13:26.770" style="s2">discuss and really figure out how we</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.760" end="00:13:28.180" style="s2">feel about it personally and then be in</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.770" end="00:13:29.860" style="s2">a dialogue with one another and that</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.180" end="00:13:31.420" style="s2">there&#39;s been a real hunger for that and</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.860" end="00:13:32.800" style="s2">that&#39;s been very exciting to do</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.420" end="00:13:35.680" style="s2">so the summit is by far the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.800" end="00:13:38.860" style="s2">event we&#39;ve done and we&#39;ve capped it at</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.680" end="00:13:40.330" style="s2">150 people and partly because we want to</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.860" end="00:13:41.710" style="s2">keep it intimate we want to have an</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.330" end="00:13:42.880" style="s2">environment where we really can get into</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.710" end="00:13:45.460" style="s2">dialogue with each other we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.880" end="00:13:46.930" style="s2">be breaking off into groups so a number</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.460" end="00:13:49.300" style="s2">higher than that is difficult to do that</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.930" end="00:13:52.000" style="s2">with it&#39;s also coincidentally the Dunbar</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.300" end="00:13:54.310" style="s2">number which is for an Oxford professor</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.000" end="00:13:56.080" style="s2">Robin Dunbar pointed out that a 150</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.310" end="00:13:57.610" style="s2">people is about the amount where you can</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.080" end="00:13:59.650" style="s2">kind of have coherence within a group</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.610" end="00:14:00.670" style="s2">and beyond that it becomes more</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.650" end="00:14:03.070" style="s2">difficult to do that</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.670" end="00:14:04.810" style="s2">so we&#39;ve always run retreats as well as</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.070" end="00:14:06.610" style="s2">the media side where we work with</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.810" end="00:14:08.440" style="s2">meditation and we work with kind of all</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.610" end="00:14:11.280" style="s2">of these ways of kind of hacking our</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.440" end="00:14:14.560" style="s2">physiology to get into these spaces and</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.280" end="00:14:16.690" style="s2">what I think is really if you look into</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.560" end="00:14:20.230" style="s2">that world what you see is a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.690" end="00:14:22.810" style="s2">understanding of overwhelm and how that</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.230" end="00:14:24.910" style="s2">puts us into either fee either we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.810" end="00:14:27.670" style="s2">an exploratory mode towards the world or</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.910" end="00:14:29.530" style="s2">we&#39;re in a defensive mode and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.670" end="00:14:32.350" style="s2">many different models that show that and</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.530" end="00:14:33.160" style="s2">we&#39;ve actually got a film coming up work</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.350" end="00:14:35.890" style="s2">that we&#39;re working on at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.160" end="00:14:38.200" style="s2">which is about the physiology kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.890" end="00:14:42.480" style="s2">the physiology of generative dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.200" end="00:14:45.760" style="s2">with Peter Levine who is a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.480" end="00:14:48.400" style="s2">superstar in the world of of trauma and</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.760" end="00:14:51.250" style="s2">growth when our nervous system is in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.400" end="00:14:53.350" style="s2">sympathetic arousal state the fight or</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.250" end="00:14:56.050" style="s2">flight</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.350" end="00:14:58.360" style="s2">we will perceive the person there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.050" end="00:15:02.320" style="s2">way we won&#39;t perceive the person as as</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.360" end="00:15:05.890" style="s2">an enemy as an adversary that&#39;s just the</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.320" end="00:15:10.180" style="s2">way we&#39;re wired and again the question</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.890" end="00:15:12.760" style="s2">is how we get from there to here here</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.180" end="00:15:14.410" style="s2">being social engagement you know one</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.760" end="00:15:16.000" style="s2">thing is important for me is is that we</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.410" end="00:15:17.770" style="s2">hold it lightly because in a sense we</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.000" end="00:15:21.220" style="s2">are all participating in an experiment</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.770" end="00:15:23.020" style="s2">at the summit and also that we kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.220" end="00:15:24.970" style="s2">try our best to get into a space of</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.020" end="00:15:26.350" style="s2">what&#39;s called coherence together and I</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.970" end="00:15:27.670" style="s2">think it&#39;s interesting to hear Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.350" end="00:15:28.180" style="s2">green hall talk about what that word</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.670" end="00:15:31.750" style="s2">means</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.180" end="00:15:32.380" style="s2">so coherence is when people are able to</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.750" end="00:15:35.650" style="s2">enter in</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.380" end="00:15:39.010" style="s2">a relationship where they basically been</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.650" end="00:15:40.840" style="s2">to form an emergent whole as emergent</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.010" end="00:15:42.130" style="s2">properties that is greater than the</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.840" end="00:15:42.760" style="s2">individuals involved greater than the</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.130" end="00:15:45.190" style="s2">sum of the parts</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.760" end="00:15:47.680" style="s2">and to achieve coherence first and</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.190" end="00:15:49.840" style="s2">foremost requires both sovereignty and</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.680" end="00:15:51.310" style="s2">awareness of sovereignty I mean you you</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.840" end="00:15:53.440" style="s2">have it and you&#39;re aware where you are</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.310" end="00:15:57.100" style="s2">and a continual consciousness of</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.440" end="00:15:58.720" style="s2">recognizing that you have to maintain a</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.100" end="00:16:00.270" style="s2">certain level of sovereignty to be able</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.720" end="00:16:03.220" style="s2">to enter into coherence at all and that</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.270" end="00:16:05.680" style="s2">be in coherence has the highest</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.220" end="00:16:07.480" style="s2">intelligence has the highest capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.680" end="00:16:10.870" style="s2">perceive and respond to the whatever is</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.480" end="00:16:13.240" style="s2">going on so you prioritize that so first</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.870" end="00:16:15.670" style="s2">a - opera - yes okay cool now are we in</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.240" end="00:16:17.950" style="s2">coherence yes okay cool now and start</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.670" end="00:16:19.390" style="s2">trying to do something if not if</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.950" end="00:16:20.890" style="s2">something is out of coherence okay how</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.390" end="00:16:21.970" style="s2">do we get back in coherence oh is it</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.890" end="00:16:24.430" style="s2">because I&#39;m out of sovereignty Oh gave</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.970" end="00:16:25.990" style="s2">me to get back into sovereignty and kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.430" end="00:16:28.110" style="s2">of building back up so we&#39;re hoping that</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.990" end="00:16:30.700" style="s2">the summit is going to be fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.110" end="00:16:33.100" style="s2">I&#39;m sure it will be with the speakers</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.700" end="00:16:35.800" style="s2">that we&#39;ve got but also fun and if you</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.100" end="00:16:38.650" style="s2">were to distill down what say three or</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.800" end="00:16:42.250" style="s2">four principles of having a generative</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.650" end="00:16:45.910" style="s2">conversation in good faith ah what would</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.250" end="00:16:48.070" style="s2">they be what conditions allow for that</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.910" end="00:16:51.460" style="s2">so how do you know you&#39;re having one</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.070" end="00:16:52.810" style="s2">maybe like what are what are the what</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.460" end="00:16:54.550" style="s2">are the signals that you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.810" end="00:16:55.780" style="s2">doing it right that you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.550" end="00:16:59.590" style="s2">having a good conversation</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.780" end="00:17:02.470" style="s2">no wrote apologies apologies for actual</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.590" end="00:17:04.150" style="s2">wrongs but no wrote apologies don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.470" end="00:17:09.870" style="s2">apologize for things that you did not</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.150" end="00:17:12.579" style="s2">actually do and if you see sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.870" end="00:17:13.360" style="s2">culture of rote apology in a big</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.579" end="00:17:15.160" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.360" end="00:17:18.339" style="s2">there&#39;s probably fear right underneath</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.160" end="00:17:21.130" style="s2">the surface similarly I would say look</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.339" end="00:17:23.800" style="s2">for laughter look for humor look look</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.130" end="00:17:25.209" style="s2">for and not just you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.800" end="00:17:30.460" style="s2">everyone can tell the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.209" end="00:17:33.130" style="s2">a nervous laughter and and regular from</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.460" end="00:17:34.750" style="s2">the gut laughter in which things even</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.130" end="00:17:35.220" style="s2">when you didn&#39;t see something coming or</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.750" end="00:17:37.950" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.220" end="00:17:39.510" style="s2">and when things get funny when a</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.950" end="00:17:40.890" style="s2">conversation that was very serious are</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.510" end="00:17:43.140" style="s2">very technical suddenly erupts and</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.890" end="00:17:44.490" style="s2">laughter if that can happen there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.140" end="00:17:46.169" style="s2">probably not fear right beneath the</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.490" end="00:17:47.549" style="s2">surface and another thing we&#39;re hoping</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.169" end="00:17:49.080" style="s2">to do with the summit is create an</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.549" end="00:17:50.669" style="s2">environment where we can integrate</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.080" end="00:17:52.919" style="s2">opposites because very often</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.669" end="00:17:54.960" style="s2">polarization we see in culture comes</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.919" end="00:17:57.539" style="s2">from not being able to hold two things</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.960" end="00:17:59.820" style="s2">at the same time and being able to do</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.539" end="00:18:01.320" style="s2">that is a huge skill that helps us go a</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.820" end="00:18:03.510" style="s2">long way in having a new type of</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.320" end="00:18:06.870" style="s2">conversation this brings us to a very</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.510" end="00:18:09.659" style="s2">important metaphysical point which is</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.870" end="00:18:11.429" style="s2">that a thing that its opposite according</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.659" end="00:18:13.620" style="s2">to the left hemisphere simply as far</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.429" end="00:18:15.929" style="s2">apart as they can be and we move always</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.620" end="00:18:19.799" style="s2">in a linear way to what we&#39;d identify as</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.929" end="00:18:21.600" style="s2">good everything I know tells me that in</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.799" end="00:18:24.299" style="s2">fact opposites are connected and if you</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.600" end="00:18:28.230" style="s2">pretend that you are only having one you</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.299" end="00:18:30.419" style="s2">don&#39;t notice the dark side and this is</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.230" end="00:18:35.280" style="s2">terribly true in psychiatry it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.419" end="00:18:37.770" style="s2">a truism to say that a lot of the work</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.280" end="00:18:40.409" style="s2">one does as a psychiatrist is helping</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.770" end="00:18:42.900" style="s2">people to see that there is a good sight</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.409" end="00:18:45.030" style="s2">to what it is that they fear and dislike</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.900" end="00:18:46.590" style="s2">in themselves but there is also a dark</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.030" end="00:18:48.780" style="s2">side to the bits that they pride</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.590" end="00:18:50.940" style="s2">themselves on and that you cannot get</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.780" end="00:18:52.980" style="s2">rid of the dark side you accept it and</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.940" end="00:18:56.460" style="s2">work with moving it towards something</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.980" end="00:18:59.130" style="s2">creative and all creativity and all life</p>
