<p begin="00:01:34.200" end="00:01:41.460" style="s2">behind us and in front of us and for me</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.090" end="00:01:44.850" style="s2">it&#39;s really clear I grew up my dad was a</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.460" end="00:01:47.310" style="s2">builder so I spent a lot of time in that</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.850" end="00:01:49.320" style="s2">industry which is one of the last places</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.310" end="00:01:51.899" style="s2">where people work outside except for</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.320" end="00:01:54.360" style="s2">agriculture right and at that time there</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.899" end="00:01:56.430" style="s2">were no nail guns there were power tools</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.360" end="00:01:59.000" style="s2">obviously but it was very much still a</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.430" end="00:01:59.000" style="s2">craftsperson</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.810" end="00:02:07.530" style="s2">skill oriented trade of oriented</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.409" end="00:02:09.030" style="s2">endeavor and I was born in the city in</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.530" end="00:02:11.099" style="s2">Philadelphia and when I was about eight</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.030" end="00:02:13.290" style="s2">we moved out to the country where my mom</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.099" end="00:02:13.800" style="s2">had grown up what was then the far edge</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.290" end="00:02:15.750" style="s2">of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.800" end="00:02:19.110" style="s2">burbs has now been swallowed by the</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.750" end="00:02:22.260" style="s2">suburbs of Philadelphia and so I grew up</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.110" end="00:02:25.320" style="s2">in fields and farms and barns and spent</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.260" end="00:02:27.860" style="s2">most of my time in the forest remnant</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.320" end="00:02:30.480" style="s2">forest behind my parents house and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.860" end="00:02:33.630" style="s2">didn&#39;t know the names of species I</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.480" end="00:02:35.100" style="s2">didn&#39;t know many of those things but it</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.630" end="00:02:37.230" style="s2">spoke to me</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.100" end="00:02:39.870" style="s2">and it was where I felt comfortable and</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.230" end="00:02:42.150" style="s2">things made sense and so that&#39;s informed</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.870" end="00:02:48.120" style="s2">my life ever since that there&#39;s ways in</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.150" end="00:02:50.100" style="s2">which much of my life has been a way of</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.120" end="00:02:52.200" style="s2">trying to give back to everything that I</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.100" end="00:02:58.920" style="s2">was given by that beautiful little</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.200" end="00:03:00.600" style="s2">forest and spending so much time in that</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.920" end="00:03:03.720" style="s2">forest I began to wonder about the</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.600" end="00:03:05.880" style="s2">original people there and they how they</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.720" end="00:03:07.740" style="s2">had lived in that place in different</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.880" end="00:03:11.870" style="s2">ways and so I began to read all the</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.740" end="00:03:15.810" style="s2">books I could and came upon a copy of</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.870" end="00:03:20.070" style="s2">Black Elk speaks in the mall one weekend</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.810" end="00:03:22.860" style="s2">with my dad and it to my world that it</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.070" end="00:03:26.489" style="s2">was being a child of about the same age</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.860" end="00:03:30.270" style="s2">he was when he had his great vision it</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.489" end="00:03:31.920" style="s2">didn&#39;t it wasn&#39;t well filtered and so it</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.270" end="00:03:34.650" style="s2">gave me an entirely different view of</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.920" end="00:03:37.290" style="s2">the world of not only this sacred</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.650" end="00:03:40.470" style="s2">spiritual level of reality and of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.290" end="00:03:42.930" style="s2">living world but people being a part of</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.470" end="00:03:45.330" style="s2">a harmonious living whole and moving</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.930" end="00:03:48.300" style="s2">around and being in relation to all the</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.330" end="00:03:50.940" style="s2">cycles and changes and developments and</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.300" end="00:03:52.920" style="s2">evolutions and contributing to those in</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.940" end="00:03:56.489" style="s2">the landscape and that more than human</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.920" end="00:03:59.190" style="s2">community right everyone as elders so I</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.489" end="00:04:01.170" style="s2">was whatever 10 12 years old stealing my</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.190" end="00:04:03.630" style="s2">mom&#39;s Virginia Slims to make tobacco</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.170" end="00:04:07.830" style="s2">offerings to trees before I cut them</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.630" end="00:04:13.980" style="s2">down to build forts right entirely</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.830" end="00:04:15.959" style="s2">clueless took ideas like cultural</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.980" end="00:04:20.190" style="s2">appropriation or anything else because I</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.959" end="00:04:24.660" style="s2">was I was just trying to follow what</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.190" end="00:04:26.820" style="s2">spoke to me and so I when I went to</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.660" end="00:04:27.300" style="s2">college and I came here to New Mexico I</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.820" end="00:04:32.190" style="s2">had a</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.300" end="00:04:33.569" style="s2">job um remodeling a house because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.190" end="00:04:36.090" style="s2">what I knew how to do I had grown up</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.569" end="00:04:37.889" style="s2">doing that and we were almost done and a</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.090" end="00:04:40.220" style="s2">landscaper came and started to repair</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.889" end="00:04:42.659" style="s2">the damage we had wrought to the land</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.220" end="00:04:44.970" style="s2">replanting native grasses and native</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.659" end="00:04:46.710" style="s2">plants and it made me realize I would</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.970" end="00:04:49.259" style="s2">much rather do that and create the</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.710" end="00:04:51.030" style="s2">damage so I got a job doing native</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.259" end="00:04:54.180" style="s2">landscaping here in Santa Fe and I did</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.030" end="00:04:57.060" style="s2">that throughout college with plants to</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.180" end="00:04:59.460" style="s2">the southwest and then I became involved</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.060" end="00:05:02.250" style="s2">with the agricultural seed saving</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.460" end="00:05:05.669" style="s2">project here at one of the pueblos gaya</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.250" end="00:05:07.409" style="s2">wingait San Juan Pablo and we put</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.669" end="00:05:11.520" style="s2">together this amazing seed bank that</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.409" end="00:05:13.830" style="s2">went on to become seeds of change and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.520" end="00:05:15.419" style="s2">began to learn about permaculture my</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.830" end="00:05:16.949" style="s2">boss at plants the Southwest was</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.419" end="00:05:19.289" style="s2">actually been Haggard and that&#39;s where I</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.949" end="00:05:21.719" style="s2">first saw permaculture and permaculture</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.289" end="00:05:25.800" style="s2">too and I went off and did a</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.719" end="00:05:27.750" style="s2">permaculture course at new alchemy under</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.800" end="00:05:30.620" style="s2">the late 80s with John Todd and Bill</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.750" end="00:05:34.800" style="s2">McClarty and Roslyn Crissy and all these</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.620" end="00:05:38.610" style="s2">heavy hitters and my second PhD</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.800" end="00:05:44.039" style="s2">supervisor so I know right yeah hugely</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.610" end="00:05:46.229" style="s2">influential on me and soon after that I</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.039" end="00:05:48.960" style="s2">there was a weekend workshop here in</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.229" end="00:05:51.199" style="s2">Lamy New Mexico with Bill Mollison and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.960" end="00:05:54.270" style="s2">realized I had gotten a huge amount of</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.199" end="00:05:57.270" style="s2">rice crispies and not a whole lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.270" end="00:05:59.460" style="s2">treat so there was a lot of very great</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.270" end="00:06:01.770" style="s2">depth into techniques and technologies</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.460" end="00:06:04.169" style="s2">and not so much about their relationship</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.770" end="00:06:06.840" style="s2">or reading landscape or any of that so I</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.169" end="00:06:12.150" style="s2">did a two-week design course with</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.840" end="00:06:14.520" style="s2">Mollison in 88 89 drylands course and</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.150" end="00:06:15.990" style="s2">then went on to begin to teach and</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.520" end="00:06:17.639" style="s2">practice all of these things I was</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.990" end="00:06:21.629" style="s2">married to a woman from Santa Clara</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.639" end="00:06:24.330" style="s2">Pueblo at the time couple of Wayne gay</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.629" end="00:06:26.969" style="s2">and we developed flowering tree</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.330" end="00:06:30.270" style="s2">permaculture and so we looked at what</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.969" end="00:06:32.009" style="s2">people had done here forever and looked</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.270" end="00:06:34.710" style="s2">at other species that could be brought</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.009" end="00:06:39.320" style="s2">in and talked to old men and looked at</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.710" end="00:06:39.320" style="s2">the landscape and went to old ruins and</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.680" end="00:06:45.690" style="s2">that site as a way of seeing do these</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.229" end="00:06:50.669" style="s2">things work and how do they work here</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.690" end="00:06:53.400" style="s2">with these people and I did a video</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.669" end="00:06:55.440" style="s2">about this a couple of years ago called</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.400" end="00:06:57.900" style="s2">greening the desert 30 years greening</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.440" end="00:07:05.389" style="s2">the desert you could see it a flowering</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.900" end="00:07:09.870" style="s2">tree I&#39;m sorry at pattern mind org and</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.389" end="00:07:12.000" style="s2">the beginning sequence of that film is</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.870" end="00:07:14.910" style="s2">zooming in on Google Earth and you see</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.000" end="00:07:16.740" style="s2">the desert Southwest and as you get in</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.910" end="00:07:21.660" style="s2">you start to see this little postage</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.740" end="00:07:24.060" style="s2">stamp green food forest Oasis and when I</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.660" end="00:07:25.560" style="s2">first made that sequence I patted myself</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.060" end="00:07:27.600" style="s2">on the back and thought how wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.560" end="00:07:31.050" style="s2">that was and in the middle of the night</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.600" end="00:07:32.789" style="s2">I woke up and realized my point was not</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.050" end="00:07:34.919" style="s2">just to demonstrate these things worked</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.789" end="00:07:37.440" style="s2">it was to change how we see the land and</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.919" end="00:07:42.270" style="s2">how we relate if I had done it</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.440" end="00:07:44.820" style="s2">effectively that little Oasis would have</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.270" end="00:07:46.820" style="s2">spread everywhere it would be like the</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.820" end="00:07:49.800" style="s2">first blades of grass in a meadow</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.820" end="00:07:52.560" style="s2">instead of that it remained this little</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.800" end="00:07:54.300" style="s2">isolated postage stamp and his in guy&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.560" end="00:07:56.010" style="s2">garden and people from around the world</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.300" end="00:08:00.900" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen it and been inspired by it but</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.010" end="00:08:03.599" style="s2">I was not intelligent enough at the time</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.900" end="00:08:05.970" style="s2">to know how to design a process to</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.599" end="00:08:08.610" style="s2">engage the community to change how we</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.970" end="00:08:11.099" style="s2">saw the land and treated the land</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.610" end="00:08:13.050" style="s2">differently I had this mentality of</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.099" end="00:08:14.580" style="s2">build it they will come to show that you</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.050" end="00:08:16.199" style="s2">could do this and everybody&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.580" end="00:08:19.289" style="s2">change their mind and change their lives</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.199" end="00:08:21.270" style="s2">and that was very nice such a deep</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.289" end="00:08:22.830" style="s2">lesson I mean of course we need these</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.270" end="00:08:26.280" style="s2">watering holes and we need these</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.830" end="00:08:28.849" style="s2">examples but how much energy of amazing</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.280" end="00:08:31.770" style="s2">people is going into making their one</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.849" end="00:08:34.950" style="s2">permaculture demonstration being</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.770" end="00:08:38.130" style="s2">stewards of those two six fifteen acres</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.950" end="00:08:41.729" style="s2">and doing a beautiful job with it but</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.130" end="00:08:44.360" style="s2">but not looking at how the yogurt</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.729" end="00:08:47.120" style="s2">culture can turn the milk into yogurt</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.360" end="00:08:48.750" style="s2">absolutely yes that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.120" end="00:08:54.620" style="s2">strategically placed</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.750" end="00:08:56.810" style="s2">it&#39;s simply placed and it&#39;s also think</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.620" end="00:08:58.760" style="s2">we&#39;re materialists is what it made me</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.810" end="00:09:01.970" style="s2">realize that I thought I could change</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.760" end="00:09:04.340" style="s2">this physical thing and then that will</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.970" end="00:09:07.970" style="s2">change people&#39;s minds instead of</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.340" end="00:09:09.950" style="s2">realizing that no actually the strategic</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.970" end="00:09:12.770" style="s2">place to work is in our minds in our</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.950" end="00:09:14.840" style="s2">consciousness and one of the things I do</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.770" end="00:09:19.130" style="s2">is tracking which we&#39;ll talk a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.840" end="00:09:22.070" style="s2">about but when we see everything we see</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.130" end="00:09:24.680" style="s2">is a track right but we think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.070" end="00:09:26.600" style="s2">reality but it&#39;s a track of a biological</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.680" end="00:09:30.320" style="s2">reality it&#39;s a physical track of a</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.600" end="00:09:32.920" style="s2">biological reality and my body your body</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.320" end="00:09:37.550" style="s2">the cup the building&#39;s the books the</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.920" end="00:09:38.780" style="s2">food forests and then it&#39;s I was</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.550" end="00:09:41.720" style="s2">thinking the other day it&#39;s almost as if</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.780" end="00:09:44.810" style="s2">we think that oh there&#39;s a track of a</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.720" end="00:09:48.200" style="s2">deer if I take a stick and I turn those</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.810" end="00:09:52.070" style="s2">deer tracks into elk tracks it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.200" end="00:09:55.100" style="s2">make the deer and into an elk right that</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.070" end="00:09:58.310" style="s2">the the underlying pattern that left the</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.100" end="00:10:01.990" style="s2">track must be changed to change the</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.310" end="00:10:06.740" style="s2">tracks it doesn&#39;t go backwards right and</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.990" end="00:10:08.480" style="s2">so back in the day Ben Haggard and Tim</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.740" end="00:10:10.400" style="s2">Murphy and myself doing permaculture</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.480" end="00:10:12.650" style="s2">work and teaching permaculture began to</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.400" end="00:10:15.440" style="s2">notice that our projects were not having</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.650" end="00:10:17.420" style="s2">the effects we were after that they</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.440" end="00:10:21.440" style="s2">didn&#39;t have a long life they certainly</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.420" end="00:10:23.360" style="s2">were not permanent in any way they got</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.440" end="00:10:25.670" style="s2">second-guessed all of those kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.360" end="00:10:28.550" style="s2">things so we encountered bobandpam</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.670" end="00:10:30.890" style="s2">Lemang ben and tim ton of course they</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.550" end="00:10:32.720" style="s2">took and they realized that we were</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.890" end="00:10:34.660" style="s2">looking at same things they were looking</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.720" end="00:10:37.640" style="s2">at from an organizational development</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.660" end="00:10:40.150" style="s2">point of view and systems thinking point</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.640" end="00:10:42.560" style="s2">of view from a more grounded</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.150" end="00:10:45.650" style="s2">experiential point of view so we also</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.560" end="00:10:47.720" style="s2">were very aware of the need for how we</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.650" end="00:10:56.900" style="s2">saw the world to change and systems</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.720" end="00:11:00.770" style="s2">thinking so we formed Regenesis this 109</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.900" end="00:11:02.630" style="s2">TS so over 20 years ago this is just</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.770" end="00:11:05.560" style="s2">very briefly this is fascinating to me</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.630" end="00:11:07.180" style="s2">because in many lee years later</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.560" end="00:11:09.640" style="s2">there was this little German guy and</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.180" end="00:11:11.190" style="s2">doing his his master&#39;s at Omaha college</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.640" end="00:11:15.700" style="s2">and kind of getting on a path around</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.190" end="00:11:18.070" style="s2">2001 and and I ended up doing this PhD</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.700" end="00:11:20.470" style="s2">in 2006 where just what you trained</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.070" end="00:11:22.330" style="s2">friends slightly differently but exactly</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.470" end="00:11:24.400" style="s2">the same things of this issue that</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.330" end="00:11:27.250" style="s2">everything is an intervention that era</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.400" end="00:11:29.410" style="s2">did that designs go on designing and</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.250" end="00:11:31.450" style="s2">that we live in a world that is full of</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.410" end="00:11:34.029" style="s2">the patterns of previous design</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.450" end="00:11:36.430" style="s2">decisions that we remain questioning and</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.029" end="00:11:39.339" style="s2">that inform us this loop between</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.430" end="00:11:42.730" style="s2">worldview and design and and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.339" end="00:11:44.320" style="s2">like like Churchill said first we shape</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.730" end="00:11:45.940" style="s2">our buildings and then our buildings</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.320" end="00:11:48.730" style="s2">shape us like really taking that</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.940" end="00:11:51.930" style="s2">awareness to everything we do and how it</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.730" end="00:11:55.240" style="s2">leaves that track and and then shapes</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.930" end="00:11:58.150" style="s2">reality space and so the I I then called</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.240" end="00:12:01.390" style="s2">the work upstream from that meta design</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.150" end="00:12:03.010" style="s2">that that shifts the worldview and value</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.390" end="00:12:05.190" style="s2">system in the underlying thinking</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.010" end="00:12:08.350" style="s2">patterns that the the organizing ideas</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.190" end="00:12:11.020" style="s2">that then make people bring forth a</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.350" end="00:12:13.390" style="s2">different world so that&#39;s why I think my</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.020" end="00:12:16.200" style="s2">iced tea so deeply resonate with the</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.390" end="00:12:19.630" style="s2">work of Regenesis because I&#39;ve sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.200" end="00:12:21.700" style="s2">dabbled in trying to understand the same</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.630" end="00:12:23.560" style="s2">thing and and and kind of given it</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.700" end="00:12:27.820" style="s2">initially an academic framework in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.560" end="00:12:30.430" style="s2">last 10 years 15 years also tried to</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.820" end="00:12:32.770" style="s2">apply that somehow in my work and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.430" end="00:12:35.440" style="s2">just just in parentheses for us yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.770" end="00:12:39.490" style="s2">great article Genesis and now 30 years</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.440" end="00:12:44.720" style="s2">ago 20-some years ago maybe 25 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.490" end="00:12:49.850" style="s2">now and one of the big</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.720" end="00:12:53.079" style="s2">Schiff&#39;s we made was as you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.850" end="00:12:56.180" style="s2">going as far upstream as we could and we</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.079" end="00:12:58.670" style="s2">decided to focus on the real estate</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.180" end="00:13:01.730" style="s2">development field because it is the most</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.670" end="00:13:03.199" style="s2">destructive in agriculture some of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.730" end="00:13:06.589" style="s2">most destructive forces on the face of</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.199" end="00:13:09.399" style="s2">the planet and has this word development</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.589" end="00:13:11.449" style="s2">in it and it&#39;s very much a</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.399" end="00:13:13.579" style="s2">misunderstanding of how do you develop</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.449" end="00:13:16.970" style="s2">the value of land of developing the</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.579" end="00:13:19.879" style="s2">value of places help that be revealed</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.970" end="00:13:25.910" style="s2">and so that&#39;s what we focused on these</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.879" end="00:13:28.430" style="s2">20-some years and he you know took some</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.910" end="00:13:30.379" style="s2">things from John miles and writing about</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.430" end="00:13:36.290" style="s2">a regenerative development back in what</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.379" end="00:13:38.269" style="s2">the 70s 80s and tried to one of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.290" end="00:13:42.040" style="s2">things that really got us all to see is</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.269" end="00:13:45.500" style="s2">that permaculture design is not about</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.040" end="00:13:47.209" style="s2">designing a site it&#39;s not about physical</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.500" end="00:13:49.069" style="s2">design of where things go in</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.209" end="00:13:52.629" style="s2">relationship to one another that is a</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.069" end="00:13:56.180" style="s2">level that we all enter at but it is</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.629" end="00:13:59.059" style="s2">re-examining and designing as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.180" end="00:14:03.410" style="s2">saying the design process and because we</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.059" end="00:14:05.449" style="s2">don&#39;t we we designed both things and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.410" end="00:14:08.059" style="s2">processes to put them into being and</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.449" end="00:14:09.740" style="s2">it&#39;s often those processes that are the</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.059" end="00:14:12.649" style="s2">have the greatest effects in the world</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.740" end="00:14:15.170" style="s2">but most of them are habitual whether</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.649" end="00:14:17.720" style="s2">it&#39;s how we go about building a building</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.170" end="00:14:22.660" style="s2">or making dinner or getting from here to</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.720" end="00:14:29.240" style="s2">there and so we&#39;ve worked for these</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.660" end="00:14:32.029" style="s2">20-some years to get the development</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.240" end="00:14:35.420" style="s2">industry to begin to one appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.029" end="00:14:37.509" style="s2">place and how places behave all uniquely</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.420" end="00:14:40.759" style="s2">and differently just like each of us and</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.509" end="00:14:45.430" style="s2">every snowflake and that&#39;s where their</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.759" end="00:14:48.860" style="s2">potential lies and to begin to</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.430" end="00:14:51.559" style="s2">re-examine our worldview and to actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.860" end="00:14:53.720" style="s2">engage stakeholders as an essential</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.559" end="00:14:55.850" style="s2">piece of it not to convince them to let</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.720" end="00:14:58.660" style="s2">you do what you want to do or to get</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.850" end="00:15:01.569" style="s2">everybody&#39;s opinion but to go on</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.660" end="00:15:04.000" style="s2">mental journey together to reimagine</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.569" end="00:15:09.879" style="s2">what this place could be understand this</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.000" end="00:15:12.190" style="s2">place is a very deep level as a larger</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.879" end="00:15:17.319" style="s2">being that we are like organs within and</p>

<p begin="00:15:17.319" end="00:15:24.459" style="s2">the innate potential in each of us in</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.720" end="00:15:26.949" style="s2">this place as a socio-ecological hole so</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.459" end="00:15:30.100" style="s2">it&#39;s neither just a piece of dirt on the</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.949" end="00:15:32.470" style="s2">map it&#39;s a living system of which we are</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.100" end="00:15:35.350" style="s2">an essential piece and have essential</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.470" end="00:15:38.620" style="s2">roles that living systems are dying for</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.350" end="00:15:43.379" style="s2">us to play and all all the boundaries in</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.620" end="00:15:46.600" style="s2">that transforming whole and somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.379" end="00:15:49.810" style="s2">real and arbitrary at the same time like</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.600" end="00:15:53.110" style="s2">wait a they are all fluid and and and</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.810" end="00:15:54.879" style="s2">also wholeness is not auditory so so</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.110" end="00:15:58.000" style="s2">it&#39;s not that you&#39;re just a piece in</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.879" end="00:15:59.980" style="s2">that larger hole you are actually it mmm</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.000" end="00:16:01.660" style="s2">it&#39;s like this is one thing that I</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.980" end="00:16:04.509" style="s2">learned from from Henry port often</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.660" end="00:16:07.060" style="s2">Gertie and science that and this real</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.509" end="00:16:08.889" style="s2">what Henry calls authentic wholeness</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.060" end="00:16:12.250" style="s2">that has very strongly actually also</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.889" end="00:16:15.220" style="s2">informed the work of um David Seaman and</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.250" end="00:16:19.500" style="s2">and Christopher Alexander that holes are</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.220" end="00:16:21.850" style="s2">not additive they like authentic holds</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.500" end="00:16:25.920" style="s2">the parts in the hole</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.850" end="00:16:29.980" style="s2">bring forth each other in a in a dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.920" end="00:16:33.610" style="s2">relationship and well I often tell this</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.980" end="00:16:36.910" style="s2">story of when my oldest son was I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.610" end="00:16:40.389" style="s2">know four months old I was holding him</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.910" end="00:16:42.670" style="s2">at night and he was sleeping excuse me</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.389" end="00:16:44.620" style="s2">and having built things my whole life I</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.670" end="00:16:48.220" style="s2">thought about how I would make his</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.620" end="00:16:49.870" style="s2">miraculous body and so I would of course</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.220" end="00:16:51.459" style="s2">frame him up I&#39;d put all those bones</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.870" end="00:16:53.350" style="s2">together and attach it with tendons and</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.459" end="00:16:55.420" style="s2">ligaments and muscles and I&#39;d run his</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.350" end="00:16:58.360" style="s2">circulatory system and his nervous</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.420" end="00:17:01.899" style="s2">system and install all of his organs and</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.360" end="00:17:04.179" style="s2">she them with skin and make sure all the</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.899" end="00:17:06.549" style="s2">joints worked fill him up with blood and</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.179" end="00:17:11.850" style="s2">some food and some water and start him</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.549" end="00:17:15.780" style="s2">up and it made me</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.850" end="00:17:17.610" style="s2">realize that that is how I and I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.780" end="00:17:20.490" style="s2">we think about designing and making</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.610" end="00:17:23.250" style="s2">anything even a curriculum or a school</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.490" end="00:17:26.130" style="s2">or a business that we think we are going</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.250" end="00:17:28.919" style="s2">to create it structurally and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.130" end="00:17:32.250" style="s2">articulate it somehow and then we turn</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.919" end="00:17:34.710" style="s2">it on and it begins to operate this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.250" end="00:17:37.620" style="s2">such a fascinating like the metaphor you</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.710" end="00:17:39.720" style="s2">of the because I&#39;ve just gone through</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.620" end="00:17:42.179" style="s2">this with my and two and a half year old</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.720" end="00:17:45.900" style="s2">daughter and coming back coming from a</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.179" end="00:17:48.600" style="s2">biological training and and a long line</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.900" end="00:17:50.340" style="s2">of medics man my mom and my grandfather</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.600" end="00:17:53.070" style="s2">and so on I</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.340" end="00:17:54.480" style="s2">Lucia just seem like even from the</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.070" end="00:17:58.559" style="s2">beginning that we know that we were</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.480" end="00:18:00.570" style="s2">pregnant and the thought that there was</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.559" end="00:18:03.630" style="s2">this magic process happening of two</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.570" end="00:18:06.419" style="s2">cells meeting and then going to four and</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.630" end="00:18:09.390" style="s2">to 8 into 16 and then this little ball</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.419" end="00:18:11.760" style="s2">and then suddenly it was going through</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.390" end="00:18:13.530" style="s2">all the evolutionary stages of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.760" end="00:18:17.340" style="s2">looking like fish looking like chicken</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.530" end="00:18:20.730" style="s2">looking like and and and they months</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.340" end="00:18:23.880" style="s2">later this magical being is come into</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.730" end="00:18:26.250" style="s2">the world and and since then it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.880" end="00:18:29.659" style="s2">been evolving like you see as involved</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.250" end="00:18:32.460" style="s2">so rapidly and every day I thought I</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.659" end="00:18:35.549" style="s2">can&#39;t believe we really think that our</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.460" end="00:18:38.460" style="s2">technology has all technology has</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.549" end="00:18:40.110" style="s2">anything against the intelligence and</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.460" end="00:18:43.309" style="s2">the complexity of biological processes</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.110" end="00:18:47.760" style="s2">the arrogance we have to even compare</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.309" end="00:18:49.799" style="s2">what we can do crudely within that tech</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.760" end="00:18:53.970" style="s2">technological mechanistic frame and how</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.799" end="00:18:56.669" style="s2">how nature works with processes it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.970" end="00:18:59.970" style="s2">of the reasons I&#39;ve come to call biology</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.669" end="00:19:04.140" style="s2">metaphysics because it may be in</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.970" end="00:19:07.140" style="s2">physical bodies of all sorts but the</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.140" end="00:19:10.530" style="s2">life is is not physically within</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.140" end="00:19:12.150" style="s2">anything right it&#39;s it&#39;s the exchanges</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.530" end="00:19:14.130" style="s2">that are happening right as soon as I</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.150" end="00:19:16.020" style="s2">stop breathing in the atmosphere stops</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.130" end="00:19:19.049" style="s2">rushing into my lungs and every cell and</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.020" end="00:19:21.720" style="s2">rushing back out and and my heart stops</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.049" end="00:19:23.460" style="s2">beating and I stop water and food stop</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.720" end="00:19:25.710" style="s2">jumping up off the earth and through my</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.460" end="00:19:27.539" style="s2">mouth and that</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.710" end="00:19:31.580" style="s2">the life is the exchange within those</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.539" end="00:19:35.130" style="s2">physical mechanical structures and</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.580" end="00:19:37.890" style="s2">there&#39;s this a couple remarkable things</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.130" end="00:19:46.409" style="s2">in there your daughter my son each of us</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.890" end="00:19:50.460" style="s2">was never not a hole right and right the</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.409" end="00:19:53.549" style="s2">river was never not a hole and all of us</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.460" end="00:19:55.260" style="s2">the tree and each of us was made our</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.549" end="00:19:57.770" style="s2">structure was made by carrying out the</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.260" end="00:20:00.720" style="s2">processes that were still carrying out</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.770" end="00:20:07.020" style="s2">metabolizing nutrients with the use of</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.720" end="00:20:09.539" style="s2">oxygen moving learning the water flowing</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.020" end="00:20:12.059" style="s2">made the river right the tree taking</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.539" end="00:20:14.130" style="s2">atmospheric carbon and sunlight and</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.059" end="00:20:15.779" style="s2">putting into the earth and taking water</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.130" end="00:20:18.690" style="s2">nutrients and putting them up into the</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.779" end="00:20:21.899" style="s2">sky that started when that seed was</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.690" end="00:20:25.470" style="s2">sprouting right and so all biological</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.899" end="00:20:28.100" style="s2">structures were formed carrying out the</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.470" end="00:20:33.450" style="s2">processes they were formed to carry out</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.100" end="00:20:35.039" style="s2">it&#39;s a remarkable shift in how we view</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.450" end="00:20:38.640" style="s2">the world and that&#39;s what I&#39;m always</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.039" end="00:20:42.899" style="s2">looking for to to things and we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.640" end="00:20:47.460" style="s2">a little bit on detour here but this is</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.899" end="00:20:51.929" style="s2">fascinating for me and because I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.460" end="00:20:55.640" style="s2">to get there later and it&#39;s almost like</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.929" end="00:20:55.640" style="s2">I can encapsulate it with with</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.059" end="00:21:02.130" style="s2">suppose like like said 250 years ago who</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.970" end="00:21:04.770" style="s2">doesn&#39;t see nature everywhere sees her</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.130" end="00:21:07.140" style="s2">know we&#39;re in the right light mm-hmm and</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.770" end="00:21:09.299" style="s2">when when even like I even as I was</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.140" end="00:21:12.919" style="s2">speaking earlier about technology and</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.299" end="00:21:15.330" style="s2">life I I was observing myself and</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.919" end="00:21:18.710" style="s2">thinking well yeah but here you are</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.330" end="00:21:25.049" style="s2">again creating a dualism between</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.710" end="00:21:27.840" style="s2">technology and nature and and the best</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.049" end="00:21:31.100" style="s2">way I&#39;ve come to if you really sit</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.840" end="00:21:36.570" style="s2">deeply with that sentence of good and</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.100" end="00:21:37.570" style="s2">and it kind of makes sense that the</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.570" end="00:21:40.509" style="s2">earth within</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.570" end="00:21:43.629" style="s2">the solar system within the cosmos all</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.509" end="00:21:45.729" style="s2">of that is nested wholeness and even if</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.629" end="00:21:48.609" style="s2">you stay just within the biosphere it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.729" end="00:21:51.999" style="s2">one transforming process of which</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.609" end="00:21:54.999" style="s2">nothing is outside therefore all our</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.999" end="00:21:59.080" style="s2">technology has to somehow also be seen</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.999" end="00:22:00.729" style="s2">as nature and that jars with me to some</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.080" end="00:22:03.759" style="s2">extent the only way I can reintegrate</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.729" end="00:22:05.799" style="s2">that is to say they are adaptive and</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.759" end="00:22:09.700" style="s2">maladaptive pathways in the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.799" end="00:22:12.460" style="s2">journey and those kind of like atomic</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.700" end="00:22:17.679" style="s2">power plant or a nuclear weapon um I</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.460" end="00:22:20.979" style="s2">just maladaptive dead ends and that</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.679" end="00:22:24.190" style="s2">natural system by I&#39;m just how do you</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.979" end="00:22:27.070" style="s2">how do you square that nature everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.190" end="00:22:30.429" style="s2">and then our deep attention to learning</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.070" end="00:22:32.739" style="s2">as nature from nature to then be able to</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.429" end="00:22:35.409" style="s2">design as nature and and bring health</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.739" end="00:22:38.259" style="s2">and wholeness to the system that we</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.409" end="00:22:40.149" style="s2">participate in but then also like that</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.259" end="00:22:42.340" style="s2">brings us forth and that we co-create</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.149" end="00:22:44.409" style="s2">this because there&#39;s this dimension of</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.340" end="00:22:48.999" style="s2">mind as well like life because you said</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.409" end="00:22:54.340" style="s2">life is it not easier to say that</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.999" end="00:22:56.440" style="s2">everything is a life extent so it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.340" end="00:22:59.039" style="s2">of the reasons why we always talk about</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.440" end="00:23:03.849" style="s2">living systems as opposed to nature</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.039" end="00:23:06.940" style="s2">right and it all of this also carries</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.849" end="00:23:09.399" style="s2">over into what we call mind if you</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.940" end="00:23:10.799" style="s2">listen to a Buddhist they will say your</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.399" end="00:23:13.629" style="s2">mind</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.799" end="00:23:15.789" style="s2">right it&#39;s not some intellectual thing</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.629" end="00:23:17.950" style="s2">that&#39;s separate and it&#39;s what&#39;s behind</p>

<p begin="00:26:30.300" end="00:26:34.080" style="s2">figure out how to be better and we have</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.370" end="00:26:37.740" style="s2">to use our intelligence to design</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.080" end="00:26:41.640" style="s2">systems that are less bad and maybe they</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.740" end="00:26:46.230" style="s2">could help heal things Hey but basically</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.640" end="00:26:51.090" style="s2">human beings are bad and he said no we</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.230" end="00:26:53.580" style="s2">are here for a reason right and our job</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.090" end="00:26:54.840" style="s2">is to figure out that reason right and</p>

<p begin="00:31:16.070" end="00:31:20.570" style="s2">except maybe these oak trees right by</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.840" end="00:31:23.690" style="s2">the ranch house that&#39;s over 100 years</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.570" end="00:31:26.029" style="s2">old that 100 years ago this was</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.690" end="00:31:29.779" style="s2">clear-cut there was nothing here and</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.029" end="00:31:33.320" style="s2">though today it&#39;s a forest it was not in</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.779" end="00:31:35.480" style="s2">right this is something that we often I</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.320" end="00:31:38.179" style="s2">got noticed this here on my oka that</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.480" end="00:31:40.429" style="s2">people have an idea of what the original</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.179" end="00:31:42.409" style="s2">landscape looks like and then if you</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.429" end="00:31:44.360" style="s2">just scratch the surface a bit and look</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.409" end="00:31:46.070" style="s2">at the into the history we came for</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.360" end="00:31:48.289" style="s2">example everybody thinks of Mayorkas</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.070" end="00:31:51.409" style="s2">the land of the almond blossom and</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.289" end="00:31:54.549" style="s2">almond trees around the landscape and</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.409" end="00:31:59.059" style="s2">really it was in the 1930s when the the</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.549" end="00:32:02.360" style="s2">vine rock came in the destroyed the vine</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.059" end="00:32:06.409" style="s2">and why grapes industry in both France</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.360" end="00:32:08.149" style="s2">and also came to me oka that all the the</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.409" end="00:32:10.750" style="s2">vineyards were ripped up and the almonds</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.149" end="00:32:16.820" style="s2">came into it it&#39;s not that old right</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.750" end="00:32:19.519" style="s2">yeah and so how do we use what we see so</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.820" end="00:32:25.610" style="s2">that in our minds eye we can see this</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.519" end="00:32:30.559" style="s2">longer story this process and every</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.610" end="00:32:33.350" style="s2">story has a trajectory and our lives are</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.559" end="00:32:37.299" style="s2">in one little piece of this millennial</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.350" end="00:32:41.330" style="s2">you know multi-million year story and</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.299" end="00:32:44.300" style="s2">how can we play a role in that so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.330" end="00:32:46.760" style="s2">moving in one direction or the other</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.300" end="00:32:49.700" style="s2">and the thing that is striking to me is</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.760" end="00:32:51.050" style="s2">all these things permaculture and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.700" end="00:32:53.090" style="s2">living systems thinking through</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.050" end="00:32:55.870" style="s2">Regenesis that comes down to the Sufis</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.090" end="00:32:58.730" style="s2">in kerchief and Charlie Crone and</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.870" end="00:33:00.890" style="s2">tracking they&#39;re all pattern ways of</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.730" end="00:33:03.620" style="s2">looking at the world you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.890" end="00:33:06.410" style="s2">looking at the surface to see what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.620" end="00:33:09.740" style="s2">essential what is out of time and space</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.410" end="00:33:13.220" style="s2">that&#39;s behind it because it&#39;s there that</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.740" end="00:33:16.640" style="s2">we can work that makes the mechanical</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.220" end="00:33:19.310" style="s2">world a physical world different whereas</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.640" end="00:33:20.600" style="s2">if we don&#39;t change that we can make the</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.310" end="00:33:24.440" style="s2">physical world different but it will</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.600" end="00:33:27.770" style="s2">revert because that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.440" end="00:33:30.470" style="s2">fascinating thing about that idea of</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.770" end="00:33:33.200" style="s2">resilience that so many people think</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.470" end="00:33:35.890" style="s2">resilience is always necessarily a good</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.200" end="00:33:38.480" style="s2">thing but but really the resilience of</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.890" end="00:33:41.180" style="s2">the degenerative patterns that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.480" end="00:33:43.340" style="s2">created and we were talking earlier the</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.180" end="00:33:45.830" style="s2">the the way our minds have been calling</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.340" end="00:33:47.270" style="s2">not colonized with certain thought forms</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.830" end="00:33:50.540" style="s2">and organizing ideas</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.270" end="00:33:52.310" style="s2">that&#39;s what bounces back we try to keep</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.540" end="00:33:53.720" style="s2">great things and we think yes we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.310" end="00:33:55.250" style="s2">achieved something look at this that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.720" end="00:33:58.610" style="s2">an example we can do it everywhere now</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.250" end="00:34:02.180" style="s2">copy paste and then we&#39;re surprised it</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.610" end="00:34:04.430" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work because the the system is</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.180" end="00:34:07.100" style="s2">built around resilient patterns that</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.430" end="00:34:09.770" style="s2">perpetuated in its degenerative patterns</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.100" end="00:34:13.280" style="s2">if we don&#39;t go to the level of patterns</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.770" end="00:34:15.230" style="s2">and bright but briefly and just for the</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.280" end="00:34:17.570" style="s2">sake of people learning more about it</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.230" end="00:34:19.100" style="s2">because I when I looked at your website</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.570" end="00:34:20.840" style="s2">and I can I kicked through to the</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.100" end="00:34:23.030" style="s2">tracking project I was struck by a</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.840" end="00:34:25.190" style="s2">hundred thousand people having gone</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.030" end="00:34:28.610" style="s2">through that program and having worked</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.190" end="00:34:31.580" style="s2">with kind of vision fast and in solo</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.610" end="00:34:34.160" style="s2">time in nature and time outside myself</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.580" end="00:34:38.300" style="s2">and while I haven&#39;t done any of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.160" end="00:34:41.650" style="s2">tracking work like the John Young eight</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.300" end="00:34:43.790" style="s2">shields path and myself yet also deeply</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.650" end="00:34:45.700" style="s2">resonating with that approach in seeing</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.790" end="00:34:48.290" style="s2">how transformative it is to people so</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.700" end="00:34:52.250" style="s2">learning about yet another watering hole</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.290" end="00:34:53.929" style="s2">an organization that has taken a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.250" end="00:34:57.310" style="s2">thousand people through such a program</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.929" end="00:34:59.080" style="s2">please share bit wonders they happen</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.310" end="00:35:04.830" style="s2">life program that I think you&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.080" end="00:35:09.850" style="s2">important yeah I want to say one thing</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.830" end="00:35:11.440" style="s2">before we get there okay so this you</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.850" end="00:35:15.880" style="s2">were talking about the colonized mind</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.440" end="00:35:19.030" style="s2">right so Paulo Freire is in pedagogy</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.880" end="00:35:21.100" style="s2">impress coined that term and he was</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.030" end="00:35:25.810" style="s2">looking at why is it that we have these</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.100" end="00:35:27.610" style="s2">remarkable revolts and then the</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.810" end="00:35:30.070" style="s2">previously oppressed people when they</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.610" end="00:35:32.380" style="s2">get into power they&#39;re as bad as the</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.070" end="00:35:35.140" style="s2">people that were in power before them</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.380" end="00:35:36.820" style="s2">and I was in Zimbabwe a few years ago</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.140" end="00:35:39.190" style="s2">teaching permaculture and I got to see</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.820" end="00:35:42.310" style="s2">this firsthand and when I was in college</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.190" end="00:35:44.170" style="s2">Zimbabwe was a great hope for all of us</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.310" end="00:35:48.910" style="s2">right there&#39;s Bob Marley songs about it</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.170" end="00:35:51.400" style="s2">Bob went there and and it&#39;s as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.910" end="00:35:54.820" style="s2">saying because if our minds still think</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.400" end="00:35:56.820" style="s2">that power is overpowering when we get</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.820" end="00:36:00.760" style="s2">into power that&#39;s what we will do right</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.820" end="00:36:04.660" style="s2">and so I think mostly what we&#39;re up</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.760" end="00:36:08.220" style="s2">against is is how do we not decolonize</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.660" end="00:36:11.020" style="s2">our minds but rehumanize our mind sorry</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.220" end="00:36:13.750" style="s2">indigenous our minds that we are part of</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.020" end="00:36:15.850" style="s2">a living system and we begin to think</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.750" end="00:36:17.950" style="s2">and work in that way and it&#39;s striking</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.850" end="00:36:22.630" style="s2">to me right even resilience is a</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.950" end="00:36:24.730" style="s2">physical mechanical term it&#39;s not even a</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.630" end="00:36:26.920" style="s2">biological term even like what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.730" end="00:36:30.580" style="s2">biological mechanism for that what would</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.920" end="00:36:33.640" style="s2">be and so I&#39;m always trying to notice</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.580" end="00:36:36.490" style="s2">how my mind is colonized by that</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.640" end="00:36:38.620" style="s2">mechanical point of view and how I might</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.490" end="00:36:41.050" style="s2">think about it and phrase it differently</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.620" end="00:36:45.250" style="s2">how we would you it&#39;s difficult with the</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.050" end="00:36:49.900" style="s2">language languages we&#39;ve got so one of</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.250" end="00:36:51.400" style="s2">the things so the TRACON project my</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.900" end="00:36:54.670" style="s2">friend John Stokes he was in Australia</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.400" end="00:36:57.490" style="s2">many years ago and follow young woman</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.670" end="00:36:59.290" style="s2">there and he ended up teaching at an</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.490" end="00:37:02.170" style="s2">Aboriginal community college and all</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.290" end="00:37:05.950" style="s2">these old guys began to teach him things</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.170" end="00:37:07.840" style="s2">and he wasn&#39;t trying to learn any of</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.950" end="00:37:09.910" style="s2">this stuff and they taught him to play</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.840" end="00:37:10.890" style="s2">didgeridoo and they taught him to track</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.910" end="00:37:13.269" style="s2">by like</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.890" end="00:37:15.250" style="s2">taking him to the park and watching kids</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.269" end="00:37:17.829" style="s2">get off the bus and say oh that one</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.250" end="00:37:20.230" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have a dad at home you know that</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.829" end="00:37:23.710" style="s2">mom what you can&#39;t kick the soccer ball</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.230" end="00:37:26.650" style="s2">nobody showed him how and so he realized</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.710" end="00:37:28.180" style="s2">they were constantly tracking they and</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.650" end="00:37:33.160" style="s2">then he came back to this country</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.180" end="00:37:35.410" style="s2">someone set him to meet Tom Brown and he</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.160" end="00:37:37.390" style="s2">said oh that&#39;s a word I can use for all</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.410" end="00:37:40.150" style="s2">this stuff I&#39;m learning that I would</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.390" end="00:37:42.490" style="s2">like the urban Aboriginal guys to learn</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.150" end="00:37:43.990" style="s2">and appreciate from their culture so he</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.490" end="00:37:47.890" style="s2">went and found this guy Jimmy James</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.990" end="00:37:51.609" style="s2">uncle Jimmy who was in the same town and</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.890" end="00:37:53.529" style="s2">a famous tracker and hung out with Jimmy</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.609" end="00:37:55.359" style="s2">for a few years and then came back and</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.529" end="00:37:57.940" style="s2">taught at the track in school in New</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.359" end="00:38:03.069" style="s2">Jersey and then came with a handful of</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.940" end="00:38:07.420" style="s2">guys out here and to New Mexico and when</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.069" end="00:38:09.700" style="s2">he had been going back and forth they</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.420" end="00:38:11.349" style="s2">had used him as a runner so at that time</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.700" end="00:38:13.480" style="s2">they were seeing aquas hustling notes</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.349" end="00:38:16.000" style="s2">from Hosanna shown a the Iroquois</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.480" end="00:38:18.700" style="s2">country about land right so they said go</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.000" end="00:38:20.829" style="s2">meet those guys for us and tell us take</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.700" end="00:38:24.279" style="s2">them this message and tell us what they</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.829" end="00:38:26.950" style="s2">said and so when he got back to the</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.279" end="00:38:29.500" style="s2">states and they asked him to help train</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.950" end="00:38:34.349" style="s2">their young people and so he formed a</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.500" end="00:38:37.869" style="s2">tracking project to help fund that so</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.349" end="00:38:40.359" style="s2">and that has since spread worldwide and</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.869" end="00:38:44.829" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of we joke all the time that</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.359" end="00:38:47.319" style="s2">the tracking project is like a few</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.829" end="00:38:49.960" style="s2">coolers and a bag of fire sticks and a</p>

<p begin="00:38:58.990" end="00:39:07.390" style="s2">acted as teachers and mentors and and so</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.509" end="00:39:10.119" style="s2">I&#39;ve learned a lot from that way of</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.390" end="00:39:13.630" style="s2">looking at things and John&#39;s way of</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.119" end="00:39:14.349" style="s2">working and he too is a wonderful</p>

<p begin="00:39:14.349" end="00:39:20.109" style="s2">and has taught me a lot about how do we</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.960" end="00:39:23.850" style="s2">actually communicate and how do we</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.109" end="00:39:26.370" style="s2">actually work on shifting fields so</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.850" end="00:39:30.680" style="s2">he tells the story of these people came</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.370" end="00:39:30.680" style="s2">to a tracking class to learn about I</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.720" end="00:39:37.770" style="s2">said John here&#39;s how we got on our</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.520" end="00:39:41.250" style="s2">notebooks and he they were blank and</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.770" end="00:39:43.080" style="s2">they said we don&#39;t know what you did to</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.250" end="00:39:47.160" style="s2">create leadership and community but you</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.080" end="00:39:49.350" style="s2">did it in everything you did so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.160" end="00:39:51.210" style="s2">that tracking piece that&#39;s that pattern</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.350" end="00:39:54.210" style="s2">piece it&#39;s not what you do it&#39;s how you</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.210" end="00:39:56.250" style="s2">do it how do you teach fire-making in a</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.210" end="00:39:59.790" style="s2">way that causes internal locus of</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.250" end="00:40:01.650" style="s2">control how do you teach tracking so</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.790" end="00:40:03.240" style="s2">that it gets people to consider it</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.650" end="00:40:05.250" style="s2">externally to be able to see</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.240" end="00:40:10.320" style="s2">systemically in a living biological</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.250" end="00:40:12.630" style="s2">world how do you run things so that</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.320" end="00:40:15.720" style="s2">everybody feels like they have a</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.630" end="00:40:20.850" style="s2">leadership role whether they&#39;re four or</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.720" end="00:40:22.560" style="s2">forty right so and that&#39;s also behind</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.850" end="00:40:24.990" style="s2">all the work we&#39;re doing every Genesis</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.560" end="00:40:25.830" style="s2">it&#39;s not about what we&#39;re doing it&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.990" end="00:40:28.500" style="s2">we&#39;re doing it</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.830" end="00:40:30.630" style="s2">right and how are we getting it the</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.500" end="00:40:32.190" style="s2">biggest thing the two things I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.630" end="00:40:34.550" style="s2">realizing more and more Danielle that</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.190" end="00:40:36.960" style="s2">are so important the first one is</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.550" end="00:40:40.230" style="s2">getting to that place where I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.960" end="00:40:41.910" style="s2">and asking for help</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.230" end="00:40:43.890" style="s2">whatever that means internally and</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.910" end="00:40:47.070" style="s2">externally because otherwise I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.890" end="00:40:49.680" style="s2">doing the same old crap I&#39;ve done before</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.070" end="00:40:54.480" style="s2">it&#39;s things I&#39;ve thought before and the</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.680" end="00:40:57.060" style="s2">other one is to set the bar high for</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.480" end="00:41:01.280" style="s2">everyone and everything that everyone</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.060" end="00:41:04.170" style="s2">here is as capable as I am that they are</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.280" end="00:41:05.940" style="s2">excuse me it&#39;s about me helping them be</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.170" end="00:41:09.990" style="s2">creative it&#39;s not about me being the</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.940" end="00:41:15.630" style="s2">creative genius which is again I mean</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.990" end="00:41:19.470" style="s2">all of this is so deeply resonant with</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.630" end="00:41:22.340" style="s2">indigenous wisdom from First Nations</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.470" end="00:41:26.540" style="s2">people all over the globe the little</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.340" end="00:41:29.670" style="s2">glimpses I&#39;m nowhere near got the same</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.540" end="00:41:31.590" style="s2">depth of having and privileged enough to</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.670" end="00:41:33.210" style="s2">learn from people directly like you have</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.590" end="00:41:35.310" style="s2">for so many years but like for example</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.210" end="00:41:35.890" style="s2">working with Gigi Coyle and people from</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.310" end="00:41:37.660" style="s2">the school of</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.890" end="00:41:41.890" style="s2">borders and doing a Vision Quest there</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.660" end="00:41:45.430" style="s2">and sitting in council and there have</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.890" end="00:41:47.980" style="s2">been moments where I&#39;ve touched into</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.430" end="00:41:50.640" style="s2">that world or like talking with Dominic</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.980" end="00:41:56.589" style="s2">and and with Jason about their</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.640" end="00:42:02.019" style="s2">experiences in Australia it&#39;s it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.589" end="00:42:06.940" style="s2">fundamental to keep an apprentice</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.019" end="00:42:08.859" style="s2">program mind not the hero mindset of of</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.940" end="00:42:11.289" style="s2">our storytelling of it like even I think</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.859" end="00:42:13.809" style="s2">this this this hero&#39;s journey story that</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.289" end="00:42:16.990" style="s2">people get so into is still far too</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.809" end="00:42:19.000" style="s2">focused on this idea that it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.990" end="00:42:25.230" style="s2">individual that is gonna take people to</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.000" end="00:42:30.250" style="s2">safety and and really yeah how do we</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.230" end="00:42:32.680" style="s2">enable everyone to bring forth a healthy</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.250" end="00:42:38.109" style="s2">whole in which everyone can keep</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.680" end="00:42:41.950" style="s2">evolving learning and and in this dance</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.109" end="00:42:44.109" style="s2">with humility this paradox that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.950" end="00:42:47.079" style="s2">now faced with such urgency because of</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.109" end="00:42:51.039" style="s2">the mess that we made with so much of</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.079" end="00:42:53.920" style="s2">the biosphere and we have runaway</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.039" end="00:42:56.500" style="s2">climate change and and cascading</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.920" end="00:42:58.000" style="s2">ecosystems collapse and and again like</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.500" end="00:42:59.289" style="s2">the back coming back to the question</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.000" end="00:43:02.980" style="s2">that you start your book with which I</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.289" end="00:43:07.000" style="s2">also want to talk about and like this</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.980" end="00:43:09.640" style="s2">could the guy I often leaning towards</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.000" end="00:43:12.730" style="s2">what I&#39;ve learned in rite-of-passage</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.640" end="00:43:15.069" style="s2">work and and working with council and</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.730" end="00:43:19.119" style="s2">the wheel of the four directions</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.069" end="00:43:21.940" style="s2">maybe climate change is that point in</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.119" end="00:43:24.670" style="s2">which humanity at the species level is</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.940" end="00:43:27.039" style="s2">put through a rite of passage which has</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.670" end="00:43:28.809" style="s2">this will happen that I think lies at</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.039" end="00:43:31.359" style="s2">the heart of why you called Regenesis</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.809" end="00:43:34.960" style="s2">Regenesis that we actually need to face</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.359" end="00:43:37.630" style="s2">our face our own death and die to the</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.960" end="00:43:40.960" style="s2">patterns that no longer serve in order</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.630" end="00:43:44.740" style="s2">to stay current and serve the greater</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.960" end="00:43:48.910" style="s2">whole it&#39;s this Jana base is beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.740" end="00:43:49.600" style="s2">and hospice workers and midwives it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.910" end="00:43:52.390" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.600" end="00:43:54.940" style="s2">role of constantly embracing collapse</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.390" end="00:43:56.560" style="s2">and and patterns dissolving if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.940" end="00:43:59.260" style="s2">not the right patterns any longer and</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.560" end="00:44:04.270" style="s2">constantly listening with humility of</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.260" end="00:44:05.920" style="s2">what wants to be born and that I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.270" end="00:44:08.050" style="s2">we need to come back to and like you</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.920" end="00:44:10.480" style="s2">earlier said the word rien digitization</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.050" end="00:44:13.300" style="s2">which is for me something that that that</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.480" end="00:44:17.170" style="s2">I more and more ask myself how do I do</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.300" end="00:44:21.540" style="s2">this where I am with my family as the</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.170" end="00:44:25.600" style="s2">way of sourcing and resourcing my work</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.540" end="00:44:29.320" style="s2">to really live that how do I become</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.600" end="00:44:33.520" style="s2">indigenous to ghost island and that that</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.320" end="00:44:39.400" style="s2">I&#39;ve chosen to to live on but yeah they</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.520" end="00:44:41.650" style="s2">tell me a little bit more about em as</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.400" end="00:44:45.490" style="s2">far as I understand as a synthesis of</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.650" end="00:44:48.550" style="s2">your personal framing you have come to</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.490" end="00:44:51.070" style="s2">call all these drunk from it and</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.550" end="00:44:55.950" style="s2">integrate it in your work you call it</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.070" end="00:44:58.660" style="s2">pattern mind and and now you finally</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.950" end="00:45:00.280" style="s2">putting it into a book and I say finally</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.660" end="00:45:03.640" style="s2">because it would be a gift for all of us</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.280" end="00:45:06.220" style="s2">to be able to to read that and can you</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.640" end="00:45:08.170" style="s2">say a bit more about this what you</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.220" end="00:45:10.540" style="s2">understand uniquely about Pat and mine</p>

<p begin="00:45:17.020" end="00:45:27.790" style="s2">this idea of indigenous peoples rien</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.690" end="00:45:31.120" style="s2">digitizing that there is it&#39;s easy for</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.790" end="00:45:34.810" style="s2">us all to romanticize native peoples and</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.120" end="00:45:36.700" style="s2">that it&#39;s one of the things that I</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.810" end="00:45:42.750" style="s2">learned living on the reservation for</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.700" end="00:45:49.330" style="s2">almost 10 years as there&#39;s it&#39;s been bad</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.750" end="00:45:49.819" style="s2">it&#39;s been horrific right and we&#39;re lucky</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.330" end="00:45:51.529" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.819" end="00:45:57.489" style="s2">people have held on to what they&#39;ve held</p>

<p begin="00:45:57.489" end="00:46:03.949" style="s2">right that the Indian schools the Native</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.069" end="00:46:07.130" style="s2">American schools and the aboriginal</p>

<p begin="00:46:19.640" end="00:46:23.719" style="s2">was only a few years ago I realized when</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.079" end="00:46:25.729" style="s2">I was a kid top taught was taught about</p>

<p begin="00:46:31.579" end="00:46:36.759" style="s2">for peoples for seven years</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.289" end="00:46:41.259" style="s2">well if your lifespan is thirty years</p>

<p begin="00:46:47.630" end="00:46:55.430" style="s2">around the world this was the case and</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.609" end="00:46:59.239" style="s2">that was where colonization began right</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.430" end="00:47:01.579" style="s2">and it&#39;s why then we went on and became</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.239" end="00:47:08.229" style="s2">colonizing armies because we were</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.579" end="00:47:14.709" style="s2">convinced at that that right and so this</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.229" end="00:47:17.779" style="s2">it&#39;s why I used the word rien digitising</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.709" end="00:47:21.109" style="s2">with that in mind that we have this</p>

<p begin="00:47:29.180" end="00:47:36.799" style="s2">project came upon Paulo Freire II in the</p>

<p begin="00:47:36.799" end="00:47:41.209" style="s2">this whole story from the hold initially</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.569" end="00:47:44.029" style="s2">of the formation of the Confederacy the</p>

<p begin="00:47:50.209" end="00:47:56.509" style="s2">and power that true power is from peace</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.599" end="00:47:58.849" style="s2">and you must have a good mind to realize</p>

<p begin="00:51:00.630" end="00:51:08.160" style="s2">told me the story that the Iberian</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.830" end="00:51:11.790" style="s2">Peninsula was the first place the Roman</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.160" end="00:51:14.040" style="s2">want to be Empire started to invade and</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.790" end="00:51:16.020" style="s2">it was the last place they built the</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.040" end="00:51:19.470" style="s2">entire empire until they actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.020" end="00:51:22.260" style="s2">colonized the Iberian and you know why</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.470" end="00:51:24.930" style="s2">it was a clash of two agricultural</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.260" end="00:51:27.330" style="s2">systems it was an acorn people against</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.930" end="00:51:30.330" style="s2">the wheat people and they were trying to</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.330" end="00:51:31.920" style="s2">bring in the wheat culture into an econ</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.330" end="00:51:33.420" style="s2">culture and when he told me that I</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.920" end="00:51:38.310" style="s2">thought that that&#39;s the story in North</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.420" end="00:51:40.350" style="s2">America and that&#39;s what Mollison used to</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.310" end="00:51:42.330" style="s2">say it&#39;s it&#39;s the Battle of humanity</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.350" end="00:51:45.810" style="s2">between three people and grass people</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.330" end="00:51:49.470" style="s2">and it&#39;s grass grains or or pastoralism</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.810" end="00:51:53.100" style="s2">and you may know right Andalusia was an</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.470" end="00:51:56.460" style="s2">oak forest and that the Oaks were cut to</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.100" end="00:51:58.760" style="s2">smelt the silver that was mine in Spain</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.460" end="00:52:01.890" style="s2">that funded the late Roman Empire so</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.760" end="00:52:02.910" style="s2">there&#39;s great vast plains and done kilt</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.890" end="00:52:05.370" style="s2">it&#39;s what you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.910" end="00:52:11.700" style="s2">my Orca right we think that what we know</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.370" end="00:52:13.800" style="s2">is what has been so you in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.700" end="00:52:16.500" style="s2">systems-thinking work that the living</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.800" end="00:52:20.280" style="s2">systems thinking work we are engaged</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.500" end="00:52:24.720" style="s2">with through Regenesis there&#39;s this idea</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.280" end="00:52:28.260" style="s2">of disruption or disturbance our typical</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.720" end="00:52:28.580" style="s2">thought patterns right because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.260" end="00:52:30.140" style="s2">such</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.580" end="00:52:32.660" style="s2">creatures of habit like every other</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.140" end="00:52:34.520" style="s2">living being that we will stay in that</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.660" end="00:52:37.010" style="s2">rut until something kicks us out right</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.520" end="00:52:39.410" style="s2">and what seems like a nice groove</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.010" end="00:52:44.510" style="s2">eventually becomes an inescapable rut</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.410" end="00:52:46.280" style="s2">and so I began thinking about ah well in</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.510" end="00:52:48.200" style="s2">martial arts shoot and it&#39;s even in</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.280" end="00:52:50.810" style="s2">permaculture right the least change for</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.200" end="00:52:53.990" style="s2">the greatest effect right and the</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.810" end="00:52:57.110" style="s2">problem is the solution yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.990" end="00:52:59.750" style="s2">oh well that&#39;s firestick farming right</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.110" end="00:53:03.860" style="s2">and it&#39;s also what you&#39;re doing to</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.750" end="00:53:07.700" style="s2">people&#39;s consciousness and so I thought</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.860" end="00:53:10.400" style="s2">cool I got that so permaculture I</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.700" end="00:53:12.620" style="s2">decided was not about designing things</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.400" end="00:53:16.550" style="s2">but it was about observing the</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.620" end="00:53:18.500" style="s2">trajectory of ecosystem ecological</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.550" end="00:53:20.150" style="s2">succession what level are we at what</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.500" end="00:53:21.740" style="s2">would be the little disturbance that</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.150" end="00:53:23.810" style="s2">least changed for the greatest effect</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.740" end="00:53:26.870" style="s2">that would bump the system up to another</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.810" end="00:53:29.150" style="s2">level of ecological succession right</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.870" end="00:53:30.680" style="s2">which is what we see native peoples</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.150" end="00:53:32.540" style="s2">doing all around the world it&#39;s usually</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.680" end="00:53:35.480" style="s2">taking what we call a climax system</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.540" end="00:53:36.980" style="s2">that&#39;s senescent and some disturbance</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.480" end="00:53:38.750" style="s2">moves it back to sub climax so</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.980" end="00:53:41.210" style="s2">everywhere we look sub climatic systems</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.750" end="00:53:43.970" style="s2">are more species diverse and more</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.210" end="00:53:46.760" style="s2">productive Aspen are far more productive</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.970" end="00:53:50.060" style="s2">than the spruce fir the chestnut oak far</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.760" end="00:53:52.550" style="s2">more productive and each maple you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.060" end="00:53:54.380" style="s2">everywhere you look that&#39;s the case as</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.550" end="00:53:56.630" style="s2">well as there&#39;s cascading impacts from</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.380" end="00:53:58.700" style="s2">that you you burn a mosaic pattern in</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.630" end="00:54:01.310" style="s2">the forest and kills the thin bark trees</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.700" end="00:54:03.680" style="s2">and encourages the nut trees but it also</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.310" end="00:54:05.780" style="s2">buffers the pH of the soil it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.680" end="00:54:08.210" style="s2">been a buffer the pH of the waters as</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.780" end="00:54:09.890" style="s2">well as the pH in the estuaries what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.210" end="00:54:13.850" style="s2">going to enable all those shellfish to</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.890" end="00:54:15.800" style="s2">bloom so you have oysters sufficient in</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.850" end="00:54:19.490" style="s2">the Chesapeake Bay to filter all the</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.800" end="00:54:22.310" style="s2">water within 24-48 hours but then I</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.490" end="00:54:24.680" style="s2">began to realize oh wait a second it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.310" end="00:54:27.790" style="s2">not just about disruption like we keep</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.680" end="00:54:30.500" style="s2">talking about so commonly in this era</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.790" end="00:54:32.600" style="s2">right it&#39;s not just you disrupt</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.500" end="00:54:34.550" style="s2">something and something new will emerge</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.600" end="00:54:38.300" style="s2">something may emerge but it may not be</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.550" end="00:54:40.820" style="s2">better right or it may not be richer so</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.300" end="00:54:42.530" style="s2">you have to do the tracking you have to</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.820" end="00:54:45.960" style="s2">do the observation you have</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.530" end="00:54:50.580" style="s2">notnot be a part of the system and</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.960" end="00:54:53.550" style="s2">observe in this a non-attached way right</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.580" end="00:54:57.090" style="s2">so that&#39;s like if if the disturbance is</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.550" end="00:54:59.550" style="s2">where the seed is on the the soil</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.090" end="00:55:02.760" style="s2">surface there&#39;s all the root work that</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.550" end="00:55:05.090" style="s2">needs to go into deciding what that</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.760" end="00:55:08.040" style="s2">disturb what story I&#39;m going to tell you</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.090" end="00:55:10.290" style="s2">right because most of us heard a story</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.040" end="00:55:12.240" style="s2">had an experience read a book had a</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.290" end="00:55:17.310" style="s2">teacher that totally altered the</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.240" end="00:55:20.250" style="s2">direction of our lives and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.310" end="00:55:23.640" style="s2">the whole branching of the tree we must</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.250" end="00:55:26.600" style="s2">practice it we must continue with other</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.640" end="00:55:29.250" style="s2">people to be engaged in this process of</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.600" end="00:55:32.520" style="s2">reusing ourselves of developing</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.250" end="00:55:36.780" style="s2">ourselves our minds right our whole</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.520" end="00:55:40.110" style="s2">minds as nested within larger beings</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.780" end="00:55:42.990" style="s2">that were part of that our minds right</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.110" end="00:55:46.530" style="s2">we it&#39;s my burger Bateson&#39;s whole point</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.990" end="00:55:52.920" style="s2">is that an ecosystem and a species all</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.530" end="00:55:55.200" style="s2">of us bear the marks of mind I think as</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.920" end="00:55:58.380" style="s2">we were edging I mean these both these</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.200" end="00:56:00.630" style="s2">topics of where does life begin and</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.380" end="00:56:02.640" style="s2">where does it end you like like I was</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.630" end="00:56:06.810" style="s2">singing these guy in cycles like the</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.640" end="00:56:10.620" style="s2">carbon in my lung now it&#39;s here was it</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.810" end="00:56:13.230" style="s2">like remnant and now it&#39;s dead and the</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.620" end="00:56:16.020" style="s2">similar way I think we like at the if we</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.230" end="00:56:18.600" style="s2">really go upstream it is reframing how</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.020" end="00:56:20.820" style="s2">we think about what is life and and</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.600" end="00:56:24.930" style="s2">understand this life as a planetary</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.820" end="00:56:27.150" style="s2">process that manifests through us but</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.930" end="00:56:29.910" style="s2">that all the wisdom traditions speaking</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.150" end="00:56:34.470" style="s2">about eternal life speak about the Gaian</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.910" end="00:56:37.080" style="s2">cycles of eternal when you sink in with</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.470" end="00:56:39.360" style="s2">them then you&#39;re given eternal life</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.080" end="00:56:41.700" style="s2">because like then you&#39;re thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.360" end="00:56:44.790" style="s2">yourself as an expression of 3.8 billion</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.700" end="00:56:50.150" style="s2">years of evolutionary journey but</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.790" end="00:56:53.310" style="s2">similarly mind even beyond that if we</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.150" end="00:56:56.700" style="s2">have this function I&#39;m it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.310" end="00:57:01.080" style="s2">knowing yeah that consciousness is</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.700" end="00:57:04.470" style="s2">primary that what we&#39;re seeing as</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.080" end="00:57:06.810" style="s2">physical world is the in mattering of</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.470" end="00:57:08.160" style="s2">consciousness and patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.810" end="00:57:09.750" style="s2">consciousness which are patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.160" end="00:57:13.910" style="s2">relationships and interactions and</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.750" end="00:57:16.910" style="s2">information flow between momentary</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.910" end="00:57:19.680" style="s2">jewels in the jeweled net of Indra</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.910" end="00:57:25.260" style="s2">manifesting as you or me</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.680" end="00:57:30.140" style="s2">or tree or and you don&#39;t have to answer</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.260" end="00:57:34.340" style="s2">to this tangent but that&#39;s basically I</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.140" end="00:57:36.840" style="s2">believe that this is this dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.340" end="00:57:41.190" style="s2">phenomenological worldview where we</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.840" end="00:57:43.860" style="s2">really bring forth the world in</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.190" end="00:57:49.950" style="s2">conversation like Madonna and Marilla</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.860" end="00:57:52.770" style="s2">might like to say and we everything</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.950" end="00:58:00.150" style="s2">matters like our our conversation has</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.770" end="00:58:04.580" style="s2">called agency across the fractal</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.150" end="00:58:04.580" style="s2">patterns of place and and consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.790" end="00:58:11.070" style="s2">yeah so for me the word that hits the</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.490" end="00:58:14.630" style="s2">ground is in the tracking right which is</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.070" end="00:58:17.490" style="s2">also the same ways people have navigated</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.630" end="00:58:19.170" style="s2">the landscape every landscape right</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.490" end="00:58:20.700" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about levels of landscape</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.170" end="00:58:22.880" style="s2">there&#39;s a consciousness landscape</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.700" end="00:58:25.110" style="s2">there&#39;s spiritual landscape there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.880" end="00:58:26.990" style="s2">physical landscape there&#39;s an ecological</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.110" end="00:58:32.660" style="s2">landscape there&#39;s a socio-economic</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.990" end="00:58:36.750" style="s2">landscape and the power of patterns is</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.660" end="00:58:40.470" style="s2">that they apply across scale in media</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.750" end="00:58:44.540" style="s2">right so that spiral on my hand applies</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.470" end="00:58:48.750" style="s2">all the way up to galaxies a bright</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.540" end="00:58:51.120" style="s2">waves cycles right the way nature makes</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.750" end="00:58:53.820" style="s2">resources functionally infinite is by</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.120" end="00:58:55.770" style="s2">cycling them I mean there doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.820" end="00:58:58.050" style="s2">to be infinite water just has to go up</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.770" end="00:58:59.550" style="s2">and come down and go up and right and</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.050" end="00:59:01.560" style="s2">trickle through the landscape and be</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.550" end="00:59:04.020" style="s2">held in the landscape does it need to be</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.560" end="00:59:08.330" style="s2">infinite money it just needs to cycle</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.020" end="00:59:10.640" style="s2">round and that&#39;s also how</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.330" end="00:59:13.820" style="s2">life is eternal its cycles of life right</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.640" end="00:59:16.220" style="s2">before your daughter was born those</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.820" end="00:59:17.750" style="s2">cells that made her were alive right</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.220" end="00:59:25.850" style="s2">that goes all the way all the way back</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.750" end="00:59:30.650" style="s2">and so for me it grounds always in place</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.850" end="00:59:33.430" style="s2">and that includes me Who am I how do I</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.650" end="00:59:37.280" style="s2">work what are the gifts I have to give</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.430" end="00:59:40.220" style="s2">and even beyond that you know David Bohm</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.280" end="00:59:42.950" style="s2">he says when we talk about subatomic</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.220" end="00:59:44.780" style="s2">particles we&#39;re going to a mechanical</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.950" end="00:59:52.490" style="s2">mind set those particles are fields</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.780" end="00:59:55.610" style="s2">they&#39;re waves right and so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.490" end="00:59:59.060" style="s2">things we&#39;re always working on is how do</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.610" end="01:00:01.640" style="s2">we shift the field and as long as we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.060" end="01:00:03.500" style="s2">telling a story which is we are bad and</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.640" end="01:00:05.570" style="s2">the only way to work is by shifting</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.500" end="01:00:07.520" style="s2">things mechanically and by guide we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.570" end="01:00:09.790" style="s2">gonna stop this bad things and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.520" end="01:00:12.980" style="s2">good right well and do the good things</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.790" end="01:00:15.500" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s where you see very directly</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.980" end="01:00:17.180" style="s2">consciousness making the world right</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.500" end="01:00:20.510" style="s2">because of the way I see the world</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.180" end="01:00:26.000" style="s2">I do certain things that makes cups and</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.510" end="01:00:29.240" style="s2">laws and all kinds of stuff right but if</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.000" end="01:00:33.590" style="s2">I go to of the most effective place to</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.240" end="01:00:35.420" style="s2">work where causality works is in</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.590" end="01:00:40.370" style="s2">shifting the underlying patterns and</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.420" end="01:00:42.980" style="s2">feels and that&#39;s something we need to do</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.370" end="01:00:45.560" style="s2">together I can&#39;t go off and do that for</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.980" end="01:00:47.090" style="s2">anybody right there&#39;s this the I was</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.560" end="01:00:50.330" style="s2">thinking about some I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.090" end="01:00:53.120" style="s2">you&#39;ve read the hero with a thousand</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.330" end="01:00:54.890" style="s2">masks yes Joseph Campbell in the</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.120" end="01:00:58.790" style="s2">introduction he talks about regeneration</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.890" end="01:01:03.140" style="s2">and this is right at the end of World</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.790" end="01:01:06.110" style="s2">War two and he&#39;s saying war is a trap</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.140" end="01:01:09.710" style="s2">peace is a trap failure is a trap</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.110" end="01:01:13.550" style="s2">success is a trap that we turn anything</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.710" end="01:01:17.560" style="s2">into a rut we increasingly solidify that</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.550" end="01:01:20.690" style="s2">structure instead of realizing that no</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.560" end="01:01:22.360" style="s2">just like the structure of my body that</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.690" end="01:01:25.000" style="s2">structure serves at a certain</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.360" end="01:01:26.830" style="s2">point but it must restructure and</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.000" end="01:01:30.070" style="s2">restructure and restructure and</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.830" end="01:01:34.230" style="s2">restructure and those patterns are what</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.070" end="01:01:37.180" style="s2">continues throughout so that if and</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.230" end="01:01:39.550" style="s2">that&#39;s what pattern mind is all about is</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.180" end="01:01:42.580" style="s2">how do we shift to seeing a living world</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.550" end="01:01:44.650" style="s2">of patterns and be alive in that world</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.580" end="01:01:48.160" style="s2">of patterns instead of in a world of</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.650" end="01:01:51.340" style="s2">physical structural things and then how</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.160" end="01:01:53.620" style="s2">do we read that landscape to see aa</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.340" end="01:01:55.570" style="s2">little nudge here a little shift in this</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.620" end="01:01:58.030" style="s2">underlying pattern we don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.570" end="01:02:01.090" style="s2">time and energy empowered to regenerate</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.030" end="01:02:04.060" style="s2">to rebuild restore the living systems of</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.090" end="01:02:06.970" style="s2">the planet but we do have the capability</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.060" end="01:02:09.130" style="s2">to do is shift the underlying patterns</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.970" end="01:02:12.040" style="s2">that would enable it to regenerate</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.130" end="01:02:17.130" style="s2">itself and it&#39;s one of these reasons we</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.040" end="01:02:19.540" style="s2">use the term this is because</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.130" end="01:02:24.060" style="s2">regenerative design I don&#39;t think really</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.540" end="01:02:27.460" style="s2">exists because I can regenerate myself I</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.060" end="01:02:30.310" style="s2">can serve to the regeneration of my</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.460" end="01:02:33.190" style="s2">community but I can&#39;t regenerate you or</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.310" end="01:02:35.860" style="s2">your community it has to cut</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.190" end="01:02:37.930" style="s2">regeneration must be from within so what</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.860" end="01:02:42.340" style="s2">we&#39;re always working on is building that</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.930" end="01:02:44.050" style="s2">capacity and that capability and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.340" end="01:02:45.790" style="s2">why if I&#39;m the expert supplying the</p>

<p begin="01:03:29.950" end="01:03:34.150" style="s2">just talked about by regional</p>

<p begin="01:03:40.330" end="01:03:45.820" style="s2">speak to the patterns behind principle</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.850" end="01:03:50.230" style="s2">you invite people&#39;s participation and</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.820" end="01:03:51.820" style="s2">you understand that co-creating</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.230" end="01:03:54.790" style="s2">regenerative cultures is about living</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.820" end="01:03:56.350" style="s2">the questions together but tell me a</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.790" end="01:04:01.180" style="s2">little bit more about the book you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.350" end="01:04:04.080" style="s2">writing right now because so it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.180" end="01:04:08.020" style="s2">bringing these three threads together</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.080" end="01:04:11.200" style="s2">because there&#39;s they&#39;re all thresholds</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.020" end="01:04:14.140" style="s2">to see me pattern world living systems</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.200" end="01:04:16.990" style="s2">thinking the permaculture ecological</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.140" end="01:04:20.490" style="s2">design and the tracking right well sure</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.990" end="01:04:23.110" style="s2">you could just as easily call navigation</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.490" end="01:04:30.880" style="s2">how do we see the patterns of the world</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.110" end="01:04:34.650" style="s2">to guide us yeah and using those and</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.880" end="01:04:38.350" style="s2">particularly stories to help people see</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.650" end="01:04:41.140" style="s2">things anew I mean so even that story of</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.350" end="01:04:43.480" style="s2">mr. Quinn chela that oh no Square people</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.140" end="01:04:45.400" style="s2">here right it totally changed the way I</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.480" end="01:04:47.980" style="s2">was seeing the world and maybe just for</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.400" end="01:04:50.560" style="s2">a minute right so then I have to</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.980" end="01:04:54.250" style="s2">practice in some way to continually</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.560" end="01:04:57.700" style="s2">ricci the world to continually question</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.250" end="01:04:59.590" style="s2">the things I&#39;m most certain of and</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.700" end="01:05:01.840" style="s2">that&#39;s hard work and something we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.590" end="01:05:05.770" style="s2">do alone right and it&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.840" end="01:05:08.860" style="s2">must be practiced so this is all meant</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.770" end="01:05:10.570" style="s2">to be there&#39;s this image amongst the</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.860" end="01:05:12.730" style="s2">ocean they have the white roots of</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.570" end="01:05:14.890" style="s2">pieces that&#39;s why the name of the book</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.730" end="01:05:17.320" style="s2">about that story is that and someone</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.890" end="01:05:19.570" style="s2">were to encounter the little white root</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.320" end="01:05:21.430" style="s2">tips of the tree of peace they could</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.570" end="01:05:24.850" style="s2">follow those roots back to the tree of</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.430" end="01:05:27.820" style="s2">peace and take shelter there and learn</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.850" end="01:05:29.890" style="s2">about peace and so it&#39;s one of the ways</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.820" end="01:05:31.780" style="s2">I&#39;m seeing this book is there are many</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.890" end="01:05:33.160" style="s2">things included in it from all the</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.780" end="01:05:35.470" style="s2">teachers I&#39;ve had throughout my life</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.160" end="01:05:37.440" style="s2">even if I just encountered them in books</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.470" end="01:05:39.550" style="s2">or they were trees or mountains or</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.440" end="01:05:41.860" style="s2">whatever so that people could follow</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.550" end="01:05:44.280" style="s2">those little roots back to those sources</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.860" end="01:05:44.280" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.400" end="01:05:55.079" style="s2">it&#39;s told as a large arc through little</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.930" end="01:05:59.339" style="s2">stories and lifting the patterns out and</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.079" end="01:06:02.240" style="s2">helping us Ricci the way we see the way</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.339" end="01:06:05.930" style="s2">we see ourselves in the way we see life</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.240" end="01:06:09.809" style="s2">so that we can engage pattern level and</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.930" end="01:06:11.759" style="s2">actually work in the way that we must be</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.809" end="01:06:15.210" style="s2">working if we want to regenerate the</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.759" end="01:06:17.160" style="s2">planet not just a rest death which is as</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.210" end="01:06:19.019" style="s2">you&#39;re saying that&#39;s the wrong way of</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.160" end="01:06:21.630" style="s2">thinking about it but what is the core</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.019" end="01:06:24.029" style="s2">pattern of how nature does work right</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.630" end="01:06:26.609" style="s2">you mentioned before we began to record</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.029" end="01:06:28.200" style="s2">this Gregory Bateson&#39;s quote about most</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.609" end="01:06:29.849" style="s2">of our problems come from thinking</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.200" end="01:06:33.119" style="s2">differently than nature work so how does</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.849" end="01:06:35.430" style="s2">nature work how does life work how would</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.119" end="01:06:38.210" style="s2">we actually look at ourselves see how do</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.430" end="01:06:42.180" style="s2">we really work despite what our brains</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.210" end="01:06:43.859" style="s2">habits tell us is how we work and it is</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.180" end="01:06:47.730" style="s2">through this pattern of regeneration</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.859" end="01:06:50.160" style="s2">which is about not creating a dichotomy</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.730" end="01:06:52.769" style="s2">but seeing what is the potential and</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.160" end="01:06:55.109" style="s2">what appears to be an economy what is</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.769" end="01:06:59.609" style="s2">the value behind what we love and what</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.109" end="01:07:03.119" style="s2">we hate and this very Buddhist approach</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.609" end="01:07:05.809" style="s2">of what is and what does that enable</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.119" end="01:07:10.319" style="s2">what is the potential of the future so</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.809" end="01:07:13.259" style="s2">that permaculture principle of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.319" end="01:07:15.210" style="s2">problem is the solution then if we take</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.259" end="01:07:17.119" style="s2">that seriously what would it mean that</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.210" end="01:07:21.950" style="s2">climate change is the solution</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.119" end="01:07:25.140" style="s2">petrochemicals is the solution globalism</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.950" end="01:07:26.849" style="s2">colonialism all of those things that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.140" end="01:07:28.680" style="s2">where we should be looking for</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.849" end="01:07:31.410" style="s2">regeneration that&#39;s the source of</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.680" end="01:07:33.539" style="s2">regeneration it&#39;s in the shadow it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.410" end="01:07:37.190" style="s2">the muck it&#39;s in the dirt it&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.539" end="01:07:39.420" style="s2">what we were trying to cut off right</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.190" end="01:07:42.210" style="s2">absolutely I think this is this for me</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.420" end="01:07:45.869" style="s2">that this was a gift because I&#39;ve been I</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.210" end="01:07:48.720" style="s2">moved to Majorca almost eight years ago</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.869" end="01:07:50.670" style="s2">now with this intention like after</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.720" end="01:07:53.489" style="s2">having spent a lot of time at eco</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.670" end="01:07:55.529" style="s2">villages and and working with transition</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.489" end="01:07:57.119" style="s2">towns looking at the community scale of</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.529" end="01:07:59.050" style="s2">whole systems design for sustainability</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.119" end="01:08:00.970" style="s2">and all that</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.050" end="01:08:03.600" style="s2">and I realized that the real</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.970" end="01:08:06.550" style="s2">transformative patterns have to be and</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.600" end="01:08:09.490" style="s2">looking at that that nested wholeness</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.550" end="01:08:12.220" style="s2">goodbye regional-scale I think so yes</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.490" end="01:08:14.800" style="s2">it&#39;s in place but we have to scale</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.220" end="01:08:17.920" style="s2">inking that design and that somehow in</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.800" end="01:08:20.170" style="s2">the the synergies you can build between</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.920" end="01:08:23.410" style="s2">communities and places within a</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.170" end="01:08:26.920" style="s2">watershed or within an island like</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.410" end="01:08:29.460" style="s2">Majorca is where where things can really</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.920" end="01:08:32.380" style="s2">well even that conversation where you</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.460" end="01:08:34.390" style="s2">engage people at the regional scale to</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.380" end="01:08:39.310" style="s2">say what is the potential of this place</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.390" end="01:08:40.420" style="s2">can really flourish and and so for the</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.310" end="01:08:43.930" style="s2">last eight years I&#39;ve been sort of</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.420" end="01:08:45.280" style="s2">acupuncture exploring wait how can I</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.930" end="01:08:47.140" style="s2">start this conversation here and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.280" end="01:08:48.609" style="s2">worked with a couple of documentary</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.140" end="01:08:50.530" style="s2">filmmakers that were making</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.609" end="01:08:55.030" style="s2">documentaries about sort of stories of</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.530" end="01:08:57.190" style="s2">hope and but recently I&#39;ve basically</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.030" end="01:08:58.720" style="s2">come to the conclusion that really has</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.190" end="01:09:03.490" style="s2">just been affirmed with what you said</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.720" end="01:09:07.359" style="s2">that since the island is 85% dependent</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.490" end="01:09:09.430" style="s2">on tourism the only way to engage a</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.359" end="01:09:12.549" style="s2">conversation powerful enough to shift</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.430" end="01:09:16.390" style="s2">the patterns of their system is to turn</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.549" end="01:09:19.450" style="s2">tourism the problem into the pathway for</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.390" end="01:09:22.270" style="s2">regeneration and the key is we have no</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.450" end="01:09:24.069" style="s2">idea how to do that exactly</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.270" end="01:09:25.870" style="s2">that&#39;s it that&#39;s how to stop the</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.069" end="01:09:27.850" style="s2">conversation and who involve in the</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.870" end="01:09:29.950" style="s2">conversation and see what happens and</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.850" end="01:09:33.569" style="s2">the thing that I&#39;ve been learning over</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.950" end="01:09:36.069" style="s2">the past few years particularly through</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.569" end="01:09:38.080" style="s2">TRP the regenerative practitioner which</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.069" end="01:09:44.380" style="s2">is this education program that you went</p>

<p begin="01:09:44.380" end="01:09:52.660" style="s2">stuck on that greater whole being</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.609" end="01:09:56.050" style="s2">something on the map that it is a</p>

<p begin="01:09:56.050" end="01:10:04.480" style="s2">might be agriculture in the</p>

<p begin="01:10:12.500" end="01:10:20.100" style="s2">right and it made me realize again how</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.040" end="01:10:21.900" style="s2">physical my mind is oriented even when</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.100" end="01:10:26.040" style="s2">I&#39;m thinking I&#39;m thinking in living</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.900" end="01:10:28.050" style="s2">systems terms that and I learned this</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.040" end="01:10:30.120" style="s2">from my students working on some</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.050" end="01:10:33.270" style="s2">projects with them in their coaching</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.120" end="01:10:37.230" style="s2">cohorts and their resourcing cohorts</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.270" end="01:10:39.870" style="s2">that I was going always to the watershed</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.230" end="01:10:41.780" style="s2">watershed watershed and I had to realize</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.870" end="01:10:44.400" style="s2">oh no we might be working on</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.780" end="01:10:47.310" style="s2">architecture in a region we might be</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.400" end="01:10:53.120" style="s2">working on forest regeneration in a</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.310" end="01:10:56.219" style="s2">region and so I&#39;m always learning how</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.120" end="01:10:58.710" style="s2">colonized my mind is by a physical</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.219" end="01:11:02.310" style="s2">mechanical Newtonian reality of the</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.710" end="01:11:04.080" style="s2">world instead of this biological no even</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.310" end="01:11:05.719" style="s2">the label of by region could could</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.080" end="01:11:07.920" style="s2">become the fault trap like that</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.719" end="01:11:09.300" style="s2">absolutely let me ask you something</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.920" end="01:11:11.370" style="s2">because this is something that also</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.300" end="01:11:14.700" style="s2">grapple with because I I noticed the</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.370" end="01:11:17.160" style="s2">wonderful attention to language that</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.700" end="01:11:22.410" style="s2">that is part of the Regenesis way of</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.160" end="01:11:25.260" style="s2">working and and again there&#39;s always a</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.410" end="01:11:27.300" style="s2">shadow side to that like a pet sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.260" end="01:11:29.340" style="s2">can be a little bit more difficult but</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.300" end="01:11:31.710" style="s2">that&#39;s an invitation to for deeper</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.340" end="01:11:33.360" style="s2">learning at least be full of said I</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.710" end="01:11:35.600" style="s2">didn&#39;t mind if people didn&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.360" end="01:11:42.600" style="s2">me but I didn&#39;t want to be misunderstood</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.600" end="01:11:45.330" style="s2">and and but but even thinking of it as</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.600" end="01:11:48.390" style="s2">patterns like if you use the framework</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.330" end="01:11:51.030" style="s2">of spiral dynamics in the kind of the</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.390" end="01:11:53.190" style="s2">integral human development patterns</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.030" end="01:11:55.710" style="s2">where people are at different worldview</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.190" end="01:12:00.770" style="s2">systems and ways of looking at the world</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.710" end="01:12:00.770" style="s2">then M to what extent would you say that</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.340" end="01:12:08.730" style="s2">minute you use patterns that are like</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.710" end="01:12:11.400" style="s2">language forms and words concepts there</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.730" end="01:12:15.330" style="s2">are still part of the mechanistic world</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.400" end="01:12:18.239" style="s2">you you can&#39;t but perpetuate them or is</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.330" end="01:12:20.460" style="s2">there skillful means way of saying well</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.239" end="01:12:24.920" style="s2">in this context with these people the</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.460" end="01:12:24.920" style="s2">only way I can begin the conversation is</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.969" end="01:12:29.809" style="s2">using language that doesn&#39;t alienate</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.590" end="01:12:32.030" style="s2">them and and brings them into the</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.809" end="01:12:35.900" style="s2">conversation once they&#39;re rallying</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.030" end="01:12:37.880" style="s2">around it like even like playing with</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.900" end="01:12:40.219" style="s2">the fact that now people want to look at</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.880" end="01:12:41.840" style="s2">the problem of climate change and they</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.219" end="01:12:44.059" style="s2">might even be able to stretch to say</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.840" end="01:12:46.780" style="s2">that the problem of climate change is a</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.059" end="01:12:48.800" style="s2">symptom of a larger process and that</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.780" end="01:12:50.510" style="s2">ecosystems collapse cuz getting</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.800" end="01:12:52.340" style="s2">ecosystems by the biodiversity loss that</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.510" end="01:12:54.349" style="s2">these are also all symptoms and the</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.340" end="01:12:58.789" style="s2">fragility of our current economic system</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.349" end="01:13:00.289" style="s2">is actually more upstream from that</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.789" end="01:13:03.050" style="s2">because it&#39;s the economic system that</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.289" end="01:13:04.610" style="s2">the problem and that&#39;s an expression of</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.050" end="01:13:07.969" style="s2">the mindset and then you and then you</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.610" end="01:13:09.909" style="s2">begin to to engage how do you work with</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.969" end="01:13:14.030" style="s2">that like sometimes do you sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.909" end="01:13:15.440" style="s2">kind of go here I go again using this</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.030" end="01:13:17.900" style="s2">mechanistic language of these</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.440" end="01:13:21.710" style="s2">mechanistic patterns in order to make</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.900" end="01:13:23.809" style="s2">people hear in me and then I take them</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.710" end="01:13:32.059" style="s2">on a deeper journey later or do you just</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.809" end="01:13:33.100" style="s2">never do that it&#39;s a great question and</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.059" end="01:13:36.610" style="s2">I&#39;m not gonna</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.100" end="01:13:39.220" style="s2">directly I&#39;ve spent a lot of my life</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.610" end="01:13:42.510" style="s2">being a bridge or a bit of a translator</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.220" end="01:13:42.510" style="s2">between cultures</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.750" end="01:13:50.080" style="s2">my mom was white anglo-saxon Protestant</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.930" end="01:13:52.120" style="s2">my dad was Jewish of Ashkenazi descent</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.080" end="01:13:55.210" style="s2">and in the 50s when they married that</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.120" end="01:13:57.760" style="s2">was a big cultural difference so I grew</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.210" end="01:13:59.970" style="s2">up in what may not now seem like a big</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.760" end="01:14:04.750" style="s2">difference but I spent my childhood</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.970" end="01:14:08.320" style="s2">translating for myself living between</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.750" end="01:14:10.000" style="s2">two worlds and so a lot of the work I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.320" end="01:14:11.230" style="s2">done around the world is communicating</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.000" end="01:14:14.710" style="s2">to very different communities and</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.230" end="01:14:16.090" style="s2">cultures and one of the things I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.710" end="01:14:18.190" style="s2">learned from Carl Sandford which i think</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.090" end="01:14:20.050" style="s2">is great you never meet people where</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.190" end="01:14:23.830" style="s2">they are you lead them you see where</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.050" end="01:14:26.800" style="s2">they are and you lead them so that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.830" end="01:14:28.390" style="s2">answer to what you&#39;re saying and also I</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.800" end="01:14:31.570" style="s2">notice when I&#39;m doing what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.390" end="01:14:33.100" style="s2">is it&#39;s again a mechanical point of view</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.570" end="01:14:35.560" style="s2">here&#39;s the system here&#39;s where people</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.100" end="01:14:37.030" style="s2">are I want to move them over here I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.560" end="01:14:38.500" style="s2">gonna use the words they can hear and</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.030" end="01:14:42.390" style="s2">then I&#39;ll move them here and then I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.500" end="01:14:45.160" style="s2">move them there and that right and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.390" end="01:14:51.130" style="s2">the thing I always try to remind myself</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.160" end="01:14:54.700" style="s2">of is that what really matters is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.130" end="01:14:58.150" style="s2">outside of time and space and what keeps</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.700" end="01:15:00.700" style="s2">us trapped is that we are thinking we</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.150" end="01:15:04.920" style="s2">are trapped in time and space and that</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.700" end="01:15:08.560" style="s2">is what is core to a linear dichotomous</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.920" end="01:15:11.020" style="s2">mechanical physical worldview right and</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.560" end="01:15:12.820" style="s2">I don&#39;t always know how to do that and I</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.020" end="01:15:15.100" style="s2">got to get to work on time the kids got</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.820" end="01:15:17.410" style="s2">to get there and I could write but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.100" end="01:15:21.160" style="s2">what I have learned over the years</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.410" end="01:15:23.290" style="s2">whether it&#39;s from sacred teachers or my</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.160" end="01:15:26.650" style="s2">experience in the wilderness or working</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.290" end="01:15:29.350" style="s2">with communities that the most effective</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.650" end="01:15:31.720" style="s2">place to work is in the field shifting</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.350" end="01:15:33.580" style="s2">the field that creates a different</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.720" end="01:15:35.140" style="s2">physical reality that enables us to have</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.580" end="01:15:37.480" style="s2">different thoughts to see different</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.140" end="01:15:39.670" style="s2">things to be in different relationships</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.480" end="01:15:42.580" style="s2">to one another and so I&#39;m always looking</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.670" end="01:15:44.890" style="s2">at how am i reverting to a mechanical</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.580" end="01:15:46.899" style="s2">way of creating this living world</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.890" end="01:15:50.709" style="s2">instead of going</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.899" end="01:15:56.820" style="s2">know what is how would I be working on a</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.709" end="01:15:59.919" style="s2">field mm-hmm Wow I mean this thank you</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.820" end="01:16:02.649" style="s2">and I&#39;m not always good at it I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.919" end="01:16:05.619" style="s2">always successful good line I know that</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.649" end="01:16:07.300" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s where we&#39;ve got a that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.619" end="01:16:10.989" style="s2">what it would mean to really have a</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.300" end="01:16:15.489" style="s2">pattern mind is that that&#39;s where we are</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.989" end="01:16:17.649" style="s2">living because we&#39;re sort of at the end</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.489" end="01:16:21.039" style="s2">of the conversation and for time reasons</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.649" end="01:16:26.559" style="s2">but then two things I wanted to pick up</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.039" end="01:16:29.800" style="s2">on um and now I&#39;ve briefly have a</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.559" end="01:16:33.489" style="s2">momentary lapse of you&#39;re out of time</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.800" end="01:16:37.780" style="s2">and space yeah that&#39;s deep for me like</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.489" end="01:16:39.219" style="s2">really because I I completely that was</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.780" end="01:16:41.439" style="s2">what is another one of my hunches that</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.219" end="01:16:44.199" style="s2">it&#39;s all about how we understand time in</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.439" end="01:16:48.099" style="s2">space that is keeping us trapped but but</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.199" end="01:16:50.739" style="s2">the way you just framed it and made me</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.099" end="01:16:57.489" style="s2">see my own patterns beautifully it says</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.739" end="01:16:59.979" style="s2">I think thank you for that um this was a</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.489" end="01:17:02.169" style="s2">beautiful thing but the one thing before</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.979" end="01:17:05.260" style="s2">I really don&#39;t want to let you off the</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.169" end="01:17:07.689" style="s2">hook because I know that how to speak to</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.260" end="01:17:09.070" style="s2">that but you also as you&#39;re writing this</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.689" end="01:17:11.320" style="s2">book you&#39;re asking people for some</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.070" end="01:17:16.899" style="s2">support so you can free the time to</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.320" end="01:17:19.329" style="s2">really work on it a crowdfunding request</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.899" end="01:17:21.939" style="s2">to help you work on it just breathe how</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.329" end="01:17:28.379" style="s2">people where where to find that and and</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.939" end="01:17:31.570" style="s2">what you&#39;re asking yes well it&#39;s as much</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.379" end="01:17:34.149" style="s2">to help fund all the help</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.570" end="01:17:38.019" style="s2">I&#39;m meeting in editors and all of those</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.149" end="01:17:40.599" style="s2">various and ciliary aspects as it is to</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.019" end="01:17:43.389" style="s2">get me enable need to set some time</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.599" end="01:17:46.419" style="s2">aside to get this done so I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.389" end="01:17:48.309" style="s2">working on this almost ten years and it</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.419" end="01:17:49.719" style="s2">has morphed in many ways and changed the</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.309" end="01:17:53.459" style="s2">many ways that I&#39;ve gotten clearer and</p>

<p begin="01:18:08.230" end="01:18:13.320" style="s2">individuals and some groups that have</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.849" end="01:18:16.570" style="s2">donated $2,000 and things like that and</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.320" end="01:18:18.249" style="s2">I do not have to link up on my website</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.570" end="01:18:20.079" style="s2">you&#39;re making me realize that I should</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.249" end="01:18:23.499" style="s2">put that up on the website Daniel so</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.079" end="01:18:27.400" style="s2">thank you for that it is on my Facebook</p>

<p begin="01:18:42.670" end="01:18:48.639" style="s2">and now I also know what-what dropped</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.519" end="01:18:50.889" style="s2">earlier briefly wait to close and it</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.639" end="01:18:53.920" style="s2">actually relates to this project of the</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.889" end="01:18:58.269" style="s2">book and Eddie earlier when you were</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.920" end="01:19:01.360" style="s2">speaking on ie I thought of this framing</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.269" end="01:19:05.139" style="s2">of making tacit knowledge explicit and</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.360" end="01:19:09.699" style="s2">suddenly I realized that is part of the</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.139" end="01:19:12.210" style="s2">gift that the elders in Regenesis have</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.699" end="01:19:15.969" style="s2">really been working on and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.210" end="01:19:18.519" style="s2">unfolding is how because it&#39;s one thing</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.969" end="01:19:21.280" style="s2">to go on that journey of working of</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.519" end="01:19:24.249" style="s2">tracking patterns of reading the</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.280" end="01:19:28.119" style="s2">patterns of life of translating between</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.249" end="01:19:31.719" style="s2">cultures of working with process to</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.119" end="01:19:34.889" style="s2">shift process and learn that as a tacit</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.719" end="01:19:37.630" style="s2">knowledge that you somehow kind of feel</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.889" end="01:19:41.289" style="s2">what to say in the right moment or who</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.630" end="01:19:44.380" style="s2">needs to talk to each other or M want</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.289" end="01:19:48.610" style="s2">needs to happen next but it&#39;s it another</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.380" end="01:19:50.800" style="s2">whole level to make that tacit</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.610" end="01:19:53.349" style="s2">experience that you&#39;ve built up through</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.800" end="01:19:56.440" style="s2">all the stories all the learning all the</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.349" end="01:19:59.530" style="s2">elders that you&#39;ve been gifted by and</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.440" end="01:20:02.559" style="s2">and to make that learning explicit and</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.530" end="01:20:05.710" style="s2">and share it with others and I think</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.559" end="01:20:07.659" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s part of having only begun</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.710" end="01:20:12.160" style="s2">the journey of learning from from this</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.659" end="01:20:17.860" style="s2">amazing community that the Regenesis is</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.160" end="01:20:21.520" style="s2">kind of in birth by and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.860" end="01:20:24.190" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the gifts that you&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.520" end="01:20:25.980" style="s2">working on sharing your experience over</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.190" end="01:20:28.810" style="s2">the last 3040 years of doing this work</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.980" end="01:20:32.470" style="s2">but also as you have done this in this</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.810" end="01:20:37.810" style="s2">conversation humbly with a kind of what</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.470" end="01:20:39.250" style="s2">do we know right well it&#39;s it&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.810" end="01:20:44.350" style="s2">we&#39;ve talked we talked about this as a</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.250" end="01:20:47.470" style="s2">school right is that this all came down</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.350" end="01:20:50.770" style="s2">to us we didn&#39;t invent any of this</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.470" end="01:20:52.360" style="s2">really it&#39;s just how do we apply it how</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.770" end="01:20:55.720" style="s2">do we learn it how do we develop</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.360" end="01:20:57.490" style="s2">ourselves and that it&#39;s why we started</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.720" end="01:20:59.550" style="s2">the educational programs the development</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.490" end="01:21:02.860" style="s2">programs community programs is because</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.550" end="01:21:07.030" style="s2">if it dies with us that&#39;s no good right</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.860" end="01:21:10.930" style="s2">it&#39;s like a martial arts or any kind of</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.030" end="01:21:12.880" style="s2">lineage is that the teachers job the</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.930" end="01:21:14.800" style="s2">sensei&#39;s job which means the person just</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.880" end="01:21:17.380" style="s2">a little further down the path is to</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.800" end="01:21:20.020" style="s2">make sure their students exceed beyond</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.380" end="01:21:21.460" style="s2">excel beyond their abilities right</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.020" end="01:21:25.660" style="s2">because if it&#39;s not going up each time</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.460" end="01:21:27.010" style="s2">it&#39;s going down right and that&#39;s even</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.660" end="01:21:29.530" style="s2">what I&#39;ve tried to do in the</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.010" end="01:21:32.640" style="s2">permaculture community is because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.530" end="01:21:35.950" style="s2">going to all turn into rhetoric and</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.640" end="01:21:37.720" style="s2">Dogma unless we continually regenerate</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.950" end="01:21:43.390" style="s2">it and question what we think we know</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.720" end="01:21:45.600" style="s2">right so it&#39;s why the program you</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.390" end="01:21:48.730" style="s2">intended the regenerative practitioner</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.600" end="01:21:51.460" style="s2">began was because we were never going to</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.730" end="01:21:53.020" style="s2">be able to grow Regenesis internally we</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.460" end="01:21:55.060" style="s2">were going to have to help to develop a</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.020" end="01:21:57.700" style="s2">community around the world that would do</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.060" end="01:21:59.980" style="s2">their own work and we would mentor them</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.700" end="01:22:01.450" style="s2">in their development so that they could</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.980" end="01:22:04.450" style="s2">do this better and better in depth</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.450" end="01:22:06.130" style="s2">because it&#39;s not a one-shot deal you</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.450" end="01:22:08.770" style="s2">take a week-long course or a month-long</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.130" end="01:22:11.200" style="s2">course and you&#39;ve got the information it</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.770" end="01:22:14.130" style="s2">really is beginning to understand how to</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.200" end="01:22:19.030" style="s2">develop your capabilities so that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.130" end="01:22:22.420" style="s2">like just from me tracking the beginning</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.030" end="01:22:26.420" style="s2">effects like and</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.420" end="01:22:28.280" style="s2">hosted really stands out is Oakland a</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.420" end="01:22:31.220" style="s2">and and the work in New Zealand but also</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.280" end="01:22:36.070" style="s2">in Australia and and and the Bay Area</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.220" end="01:22:38.390" style="s2">has a strong cohort now of multiple</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.070" end="01:22:43.070" style="s2">graduates from the TRP coming together</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.390" end="01:22:46.730" style="s2">and building and also the European edges</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.070" end="01:22:49.810" style="s2">is growing after like we first European</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.730" end="01:22:52.870" style="s2">TRP was here on New York and 2017 but</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.810" end="01:23:00.260" style="s2">now there&#39;s one coming up and starting</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.870" end="01:23:02.270" style="s2">today not tomorrow yes in which will end</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.260" end="01:23:03.890" style="s2">in Portugal and they even talking about</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.270" end="01:23:06.050" style="s2">doing another one because there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.890" end="01:23:09.890" style="s2">many people asking for it so I yes I</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.050" end="01:23:13.490" style="s2">think that it&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s a need</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.890" end="01:23:14.930" style="s2">for this wisdom and so I really I&#39;m so</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.490" end="01:23:19.490" style="s2">looking forward to your book and I&#39;m I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.930" end="01:23:21.200" style="s2">excited that you&#39;re writing it and put</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.490" end="01:23:24.290" style="s2">that link in and I&#39;ll also have somebody</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.200" end="01:23:26.840" style="s2">in mind we enabled me to write my book</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.290" end="01:23:29.690" style="s2">and with a generous donation who I would</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.840" end="01:23:31.430" style="s2">like to tell about you and I&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.690" end="01:23:33.200" style="s2">wonderful thank you I appreciate that</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.430" end="01:23:35.990" style="s2">Daniel I just want to say one word</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.200" end="01:23:38.540" style="s2">everything you were just speaking to is</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.990" end="01:23:41.390" style="s2">because we&#39;ve been building the field</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.540" end="01:23:43.280" style="s2">around regenerative development so TRP</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.390" end="01:23:46.880" style="s2">is not just meant to educate people it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.280" end="01:23:49.220" style="s2">to develop a field and that&#39;s why we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.880" end="01:23:51.620" style="s2">begun to do them in nodes and places</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.220" end="01:23:54.500" style="s2">because we learned from the New Zealand</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.620" end="01:23:57.200" style="s2">one that having everybody be in a place</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.500" end="01:23:59.330" style="s2">was much more powerful and enabled more</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.200" end="01:24:03.200" style="s2">work to happen afterwards and in between</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.330" end="01:24:06.560" style="s2">and that&#39;s why we just launched this</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.200" end="01:24:08.810" style="s2">ongoing developmental series for people</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.560" end="01:24:13.820" style="s2">that&#39;s eight sessions a year for TRP</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.810" end="01:24:16.460" style="s2">grats yeah so yeah so we tried to walk</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.820" end="01:24:18.230" style="s2">our talk and try to not just work on</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.460" end="01:24:20.420" style="s2">mechanically shifting things but how do</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.230" end="01:24:22.730" style="s2">we develop a field and enable people</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.420" end="01:24:25.270" style="s2">like yourself to develop a field right</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.730" end="01:24:27.800" style="s2">it&#39;s why you sponsored that European</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.270" end="01:24:29.840" style="s2">cohort was because you saw it as a way</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.800" end="01:24:31.910" style="s2">of building the field that would enable</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.840" end="01:24:35.000" style="s2">all the work you&#39;re working on to be</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.910" end="01:24:36.530" style="s2">easier more effective yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.000" end="01:24:39.920" style="s2">hoping that after this next European</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.530" end="01:24:44.090" style="s2">cohort your life becomes increasingly</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.920" end="01:24:45.710" style="s2">easy and abundant well same same</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.090" end="01:24:48.590" style="s2">blessings to you and to hopefully</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.710" end="01:24:52.040" style="s2">everyone that&#39;s what we&#39;re working for</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.590" end="01:24:54.680" style="s2">that life becomes increasingly abundant</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.040" end="01:24:55.880" style="s2">for it for everyone it&#39;s not always</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.680" end="01:24:59.060" style="s2">going to be easy because I think</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.880" end="01:25:01.580" style="s2">sometimes and it&#39;s the pain that cracks</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.060" end="01:25:03.410" style="s2">the shell of our understanding it</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.580" end="01:25:06.350" style="s2">absolutely is that I keep thinking this</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.410" end="01:25:08.780" style="s2">thing you know we keep talking about</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.350" end="01:25:11.230" style="s2">nature&#39;s cooperative and we should be</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.780" end="01:25:13.520" style="s2">cooperative and it makes me realize that</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.230" end="01:25:16.250" style="s2">we may know that that&#39;s the key to</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.520" end="01:25:19.730" style="s2">saving the planet but it doesn&#39;t tell me</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.250" end="01:25:21.380" style="s2">how it doesn&#39;t tell me how to get along</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.730" end="01:25:24.230" style="s2">with people it doesn&#39;t tell me how to</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.380" end="01:25:27.620" style="s2">use conflict in the development away it</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.230" end="01:25:30.620" style="s2">doesn&#39;t right it just is like the</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.620" end="01:25:34.520" style="s2">ecological stuff be nice exhorting</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.620" end="01:25:37.550" style="s2">people to be nice is not going to get us</p>
