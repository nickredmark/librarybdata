<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:05.339" style="s2">hey folks read here this is the first in</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.879" end="00:00:12.000" style="s2">a series of videos I&#39;m going to do about</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.339" end="00:00:14.190" style="s2">the phenomenon of left and right I have</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.000" end="00:00:16.139" style="s2">said some things on podcasts and on</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.190" end="00:00:18.060" style="s2">Twitter that have raised questions and</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.139" end="00:00:19.140" style="s2">I&#39;m hoping to answer those questions so</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.060" end="00:00:20.939" style="s2">that people will understand the</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.140" end="00:00:22.320" style="s2">framework that I&#39;m working from and why</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.939" end="00:00:25.189" style="s2">I&#39;ve arrived at the perspective that I</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.320" end="00:00:27.599" style="s2">have I should say I hear many people</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.189" end="00:00:30.060" style="s2">talking as if the terms liberal</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.599" end="00:00:31.800" style="s2">progressive and leftist refer to</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.060" end="00:00:34.260" style="s2">different factions and that one might</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.800" end="00:00:35.880" style="s2">partner with one and reject another I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.260" end="00:00:38.370" style="s2">been on the left my entire adult life</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.880" end="00:00:40.379" style="s2">and I&#39;ve never seen clean distinctions</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.370" end="00:00:42.960" style="s2">drawn between these things in fact I</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.379" end="00:00:45.270" style="s2">remember there was a time when the term</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.960" end="00:00:47.730" style="s2">liberal had been so thoroughly demonized</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.270" end="00:00:49.590" style="s2">by those on the right that I remember</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.730" end="00:00:51.570" style="s2">consciously choosing to call myself a</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.590" end="00:00:52.770" style="s2">progressive in order to evade the stigma</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.570" end="00:00:55.230" style="s2">but there was no change in my</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.770" end="00:00:56.910" style="s2">perspective that accompanied it so there</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.230" end="00:00:58.620" style="s2">may be slight distinctions between how</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.910" end="00:01:00.270" style="s2">people use those terms but in general I</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.620" end="00:01:05.040" style="s2">think they&#39;re synonyms and should be</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.270" end="00:01:07.110" style="s2">treated as such so I&#39;ve also said that I</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.040" end="00:01:08.700" style="s2">am a liberal who wishes to live in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.110" end="00:01:10.680" style="s2">world so good that I can be a</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.700" end="00:01:12.810" style="s2">conservative and that may sound</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.680" end="00:01:14.280" style="s2">paradoxical at first or at least strange</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.810" end="00:01:17.130" style="s2">but I think it makes a great deal of</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.280" end="00:01:21.930" style="s2">sense because the core of liberalism is</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.130" end="00:01:24.450" style="s2">a desire for change and if one&#39;s desire</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.930" end="00:01:26.460" style="s2">for change is an earnest desire to see</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.450" end="00:01:28.259" style="s2">things improved then surely there was a</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.460" end="00:01:29.970" style="s2">state at which things have been improved</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.259" end="00:01:31.950" style="s2">to the point that you would hope to</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.970" end="00:01:33.930" style="s2">conserve the structure rather than alter</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.950" end="00:01:36.420" style="s2">it at that point you&#39;ve become a</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.930" end="00:01:38.640" style="s2">conservative I don&#39;t expect to reach</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.420" end="00:01:40.920" style="s2">that place in my lifetime but if we did</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.640" end="00:01:42.810" style="s2">the honest thing to do would be for me</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.920" end="00:01:44.880" style="s2">to shift positions and say this system</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.810" end="00:01:48.000" style="s2">is so functional that we would be fools</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.880" end="00:01:50.850" style="s2">to change it so the essence of</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.000" end="00:01:53.040" style="s2">liberalism is a desire for change and</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.850" end="00:01:55.200" style="s2">change can be about a number of things</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.040" end="00:01:57.240" style="s2">in general for those of us on the left</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.200" end="00:01:59.700" style="s2">it comes from a recognition but the</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.240" end="00:02:02.820" style="s2">systems we find it is systematically</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.700" end="00:02:04.409" style="s2">unfair to some people and to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.820" end="00:02:06.119" style="s2">that it&#39;s unfair and that that</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.409" end="00:02:07.860" style="s2">unfairness is distributed in some way</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.119" end="00:02:10.379" style="s2">that is predictable that certain</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.860" end="00:02:12.780" style="s2">populations face obstacles that others</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.379" end="00:02:13.860" style="s2">don&#39;t we could correct that problem and</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.780" end="00:02:17.340" style="s2">really I believe we have</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.860" end="00:02:20.090" style="s2">a moral obligation to do so I also</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.340" end="00:02:22.500" style="s2">believe that we are on a trajectory</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.090" end="00:02:25.530" style="s2">technologically and in terms of the way</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.500" end="00:02:28.230" style="s2">the population of the planet is growing</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.530" end="00:02:31.350" style="s2">that puts us in grave danger in the near</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.230" end="00:02:35.430" style="s2">term both of those things suggest a need</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.350" end="00:02:38.910" style="s2">for a comparatively radical degree of</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.430" end="00:02:41.280" style="s2">change now those on the right are</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.910" end="00:02:43.080" style="s2">correct in pointing out that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.280" end="00:02:45.680" style="s2">other evidence that says our system is</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.080" end="00:02:48.060" style="s2">actually highly functional as we find it</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.680" end="00:02:50.700" style="s2">Steven Pinker famously points to a</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.060" end="00:02:53.220" style="s2">decrease in random violence for example</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.700" end="00:02:55.140" style="s2">and warfare and I believe he has a real</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.220" end="00:02:56.750" style="s2">point but I don&#39;t think it predicts</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.140" end="00:02:59.580" style="s2">where we will end up in the long term</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.750" end="00:03:01.980" style="s2">what it effectively is the result of is</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.580" end="00:03:04.709" style="s2">the fact that we have created a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.980" end="00:03:06.660" style="s2">artificial growth that goes on decade</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.709" end="00:03:08.670" style="s2">after decade and gives people a lot to</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.660" end="00:03:11.160" style="s2">lose for engaging in random violence but</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.670" end="00:03:13.170" style="s2">because it&#39;s predicated on the fiction</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.160" end="00:03:15.590" style="s2">that it can go on forever ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.170" end="00:03:18.750" style="s2">it&#39;s going to leave us holding the bag</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.590" end="00:03:21.690" style="s2">so yes I&#39;m a progressive I&#39;m a liberal</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.750" end="00:03:23.790" style="s2">and I would like to see those of us on</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.690" end="00:03:26.610" style="s2">the Left who have a rational perspective</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.790" end="00:03:29.160" style="s2">that&#39;s grounded in science and logic I</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.610" end="00:03:31.320" style="s2">would like us to retake the left to take</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.160" end="00:03:35.370" style="s2">control of it from people who are using</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.320" end="00:03:37.530" style="s2">it as a weapon and to restore a rational</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.370" end="00:03:40.410" style="s2">dialogue of progressivism to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.530" end="00:03:42.480" style="s2">landscape I also believe that those on</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.410" end="00:03:45.510" style="s2">the right who are interested in seeing</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.480" end="00:03:46.920" style="s2">the best possible system and believe</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.510" end="00:03:49.950" style="s2">that we are closer to it than I do</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.920" end="00:03:52.590" style="s2">should be rooting for a vibrant left</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.950" end="00:03:56.310" style="s2">because it is only the tension between</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.590" end="00:03:59.330" style="s2">these two emphases that leaves us with</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.310" end="00:04:02.489" style="s2">reasonable governance in other words</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.330" end="00:04:05.160" style="s2">liberals tend to be overly enthusiastic</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.489" end="00:04:07.019" style="s2">about the idea of change and they tend</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.160" end="00:04:09.239" style="s2">not to fully appreciate the unintended</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.019" end="00:04:11.390" style="s2">consequences of attempting to fix</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.239" end="00:04:13.920" style="s2">problems that are identified</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.390" end="00:04:15.600" style="s2">conservatives tend to be very skeptical</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.920" end="00:04:17.430" style="s2">of change and when something could be</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.600" end="00:04:19.979" style="s2">improved they will often get in the way</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.430" end="00:04:21.900" style="s2">of those improvements because they fear</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.979" end="00:04:22.979" style="s2">the unintended consequence perhaps more</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.900" end="00:04:24.990" style="s2">than they should</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.979" end="00:04:27.510" style="s2">it is the tension between these two</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.990" end="00:04:29.730" style="s2">things where liberals can</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.510" end="00:04:31.290" style="s2">fill in the blind spots of conservatives</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.730" end="00:04:33.450" style="s2">and conservatives can fill in the blind</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.290" end="00:04:36.210" style="s2">spots of liberals that is the magic that</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.450" end="00:04:39.090" style="s2">makes our system function well it leaves</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.210" end="00:04:41.310" style="s2">us with change enough to make things</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.090" end="00:04:43.590" style="s2">better over time but not such wild</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.310" end="00:04:45.870" style="s2">enthusiasm for change that we take a</p>
