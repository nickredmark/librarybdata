<p begin="00:01:09.840" end="00:01:13.200" style="s2">to hearing about unity2020 they have</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.600" end="00:01:14.720" style="s2">asked to clarify what is wrong with the</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.200" end="00:01:16.320" style="s2">democratic party can you point me to a</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.720" end="00:01:18.720" style="s2">podcast or would you go into this here</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.320" end="00:01:20.880" style="s2">so i can send them the clip</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.720" end="00:01:23.200" style="s2">um what is wrong with the democratic</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.880" end="00:01:25.360" style="s2">party it appear i&#39;m not an expert but it</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.200" end="00:01:26.240" style="s2">appears to be some kind of a psychotic</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.360" end="00:01:28.960" style="s2">break</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.240" end="00:01:29.360" style="s2">um it&#39;s not helpful it&#39;s not helpful all</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.960" end="00:01:30.479" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.360" end="00:01:32.400" style="s2">what&#39;s wrong with what&#39;s wrong with the</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.479" end="00:01:36.400" style="s2">democratic party is that</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.400" end="00:01:39.600" style="s2">it took up influence peddling</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.400" end="00:01:41.439" style="s2">full time in the clinton administration</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.600" end="00:01:43.759" style="s2">and at that point it abandoned the</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.439" end="00:01:46.240" style="s2">interests of working people</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.759" end="00:01:47.040" style="s2">at which point it started peddling pure</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.240" end="00:01:49.759" style="s2">symbolism</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.040" end="00:01:51.920" style="s2">as a replacement for actually uh</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.759" end="00:01:55.439" style="s2">bringing policy to serve</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.920" end="00:01:58.320" style="s2">people which now has become</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.439" end="00:01:59.920" style="s2">implausible and they are now groping for</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.320" end="00:02:01.439" style="s2">a new explanation for why you should</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.920" end="00:02:02.159" style="s2">deliver them power that they can peddle</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.439" end="00:02:04.960" style="s2">to others</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.159" end="00:02:07.360" style="s2">and the new explanation is that they are</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.960" end="00:02:09.280" style="s2">going to redistribute well-being</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.360" end="00:02:10.879" style="s2">from some working people to other</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.280" end="00:02:12.160" style="s2">working people and there&#39;s not a whole</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.879" end="00:02:16.959" style="s2">lot you can do about it</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.160" end="00:02:19.440" style="s2">so basically the democratic party is now</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.959" end="00:02:20.480" style="s2">proposing in effect the uninvention of</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.440" end="00:02:23.840" style="s2">america</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.480" end="00:02:26.560" style="s2">and we must stop them unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.840" end="00:02:27.680" style="s2">the republican party offers us a very</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.560" end="00:02:30.480" style="s2">different catastrophe</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.680" end="00:02:31.040" style="s2">but nonetheless one that we uh cannot</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.480" end="00:02:32.959" style="s2">afford</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.040" end="00:02:34.840" style="s2">and therefore we have to do something</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.959" end="00:02:37.840" style="s2">different so</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.840" end="00:02:38.959" style="s2">um you want to send them the clip is</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.840" end="00:02:40.400" style="s2">that what it says</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.959" end="00:02:42.160" style="s2">can you point me to a podcast where</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.400" end="00:02:45.200" style="s2">what&#39;s wrong with the democratic party</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.160" end="00:02:47.519" style="s2">is discussed or uh or</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.200" end="00:02:48.720" style="s2">she can just send to her parents the</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.519" end="00:02:50.640" style="s2">clip that you or he</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.720" end="00:02:52.080" style="s2">that you just gave that&#39;s the point yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.640" end="00:02:52.400" style="s2">well which is why i thought starting</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.080" end="00:02:54.239" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.400" end="00:02:55.840" style="s2">their psychopathic was not helpful and</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.239" end="00:02:59.599" style="s2">not likely to get</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.840" end="00:03:01.280" style="s2">uh voters oh right you might want to</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.599" end="00:03:02.959" style="s2">clip that part off the front i guess</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.280" end="00:03:05.040" style="s2">that was just me being glib</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.959" end="00:03:06.800" style="s2">i will say that i&#39;ve been trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.040" end="00:03:08.400" style="s2">the democratic party to wake up and</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.800" end="00:03:09.920" style="s2">behave itself for decades and i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.400" end="00:03:12.959" style="s2">become frustrated so</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.920" end="00:03:15.680" style="s2">that&#39;s where my intemperance</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.959" end="00:03:16.640" style="s2">came from next question game theory</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.680" end="00:03:18.000" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.640" end="00:03:20.400" style="s2">how does the likelihood of a covet</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.000" end="00:03:22.080" style="s2">vaccine affect how we should behave now</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.400" end="00:03:24.239" style="s2">if the entire first round of vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.080" end="00:03:25.120" style="s2">candidates fails will lockdown still</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.239" end="00:03:27.920" style="s2">make sense</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.120" end="00:03:29.519" style="s2">should schools stay closed for 10 years</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.920" end="00:03:31.200" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of questions but</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.519" end="00:03:32.720" style="s2">uh we haven&#39;t been talking about cove</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.200" end="00:03:34.080" style="s2">nearly you know we spent the first 18</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.720" end="00:03:35.840" style="s2">episodes or so talking almost</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.080" end="00:03:37.200" style="s2">exclusively about covid</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.840" end="00:03:39.280" style="s2">and we&#39;ve talked about it very little so</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.200" end="00:03:40.720" style="s2">i thought it warranted yes returning to</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.280" end="00:03:43.840" style="s2">this topic just a little bit here</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.720" end="00:03:45.680" style="s2">it does uh i would say first of all</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.840" end="00:03:47.360" style="s2">we don&#39;t know enough about this disease</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.680" end="00:03:49.200" style="s2">yet to know</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.360" end="00:03:51.440" style="s2">what to do about it because let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.200" end="00:03:54.560" style="s2">for example</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.440" end="00:03:56.720" style="s2">that it does not create</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.560" end="00:03:58.239" style="s2">immunity that is durable that is to say</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.720" end="00:04:00.080" style="s2">one person can be infected multiple</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.239" end="00:04:02.640" style="s2">times or alternatively let&#39;s say that</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.080" end="00:04:06.000" style="s2">once infected it keeps recurring on you</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.640" end="00:04:08.560" style="s2">and the um damage to organs</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.000" end="00:04:10.319" style="s2">is cumulative let&#39;s say so these are</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.560" end="00:04:11.040" style="s2">both possibilities probably neither of</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.319" end="00:04:12.640" style="s2">them is</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.040" end="00:04:14.319" style="s2">likely to be right but we simply can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.640" end="00:04:16.479" style="s2">rule them out yet the first one</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.319" end="00:04:18.720" style="s2">there seems to be increasing evidence</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.479" end="00:04:22.240" style="s2">for people getting it twice</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.720" end="00:04:23.360" style="s2">uh not so clear</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.240" end="00:04:25.520" style="s2">the evidence that people are actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.360" end="00:04:27.280" style="s2">getting it twice is less robust</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.520" end="00:04:28.639" style="s2">uh the evidence that people do not have</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.280" end="00:04:30.400" style="s2">enduring immunity</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.639" end="00:04:32.320" style="s2">and thus could theoretically get it</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.400" end="00:04:33.520" style="s2">twice there seems to be greater evidence</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.320" end="00:04:36.240" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.520" end="00:04:37.440" style="s2">yeah i must say i&#39;m a little dubious of</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.240" end="00:04:37.919" style="s2">that because i would imagine there would</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.440" end="00:04:40.160" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.919" end="00:04:42.960" style="s2">at least a handful of absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.160" end="00:04:43.199" style="s2">unambiguous cases i think i think there</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.960" end="00:04:44.960" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.199" end="00:04:46.960" style="s2">although i have not looked back into it</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.960" end="00:04:50.479" style="s2">in the last probably two three weeks</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.960" end="00:04:52.960" style="s2">but in any case these things have a um</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.479" end="00:04:53.600" style="s2">a substantial implication now as we have</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.960" end="00:04:57.840" style="s2">been saying</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.600" end="00:05:00.560" style="s2">for weeks there is</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.840" end="00:05:02.080" style="s2">a pull off the band-aid now approach to</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.560" end="00:05:04.560" style="s2">this in which</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.080" end="00:05:05.120" style="s2">facing a disease that we will have to</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.560" end="00:05:08.000" style="s2">manage</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.120" end="00:05:10.639" style="s2">over an indefinitely long period of time</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.000" end="00:05:13.120" style="s2">with potentially very large costs</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.639" end="00:05:13.759" style="s2">associated with catching the disease we</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.120" end="00:05:16.639" style="s2">could</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.759" end="00:05:16.960" style="s2">at any time institute a lockdown that</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.639" end="00:05:18.880" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.960" end="00:05:20.320" style="s2">drive it to near extinction and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.880" end="00:05:22.560" style="s2">manage the flare-ups</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.320" end="00:05:23.759" style="s2">and you know take care of it that way we</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.560" end="00:05:25.280" style="s2">should have done that in the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.759" end="00:05:26.880" style="s2">when it would have been easiest</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.280" end="00:05:28.479" style="s2">but i don&#39;t think it&#39;s a matter of doing</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.880" end="00:05:28.720" style="s2">this for 10 years i think it&#39;s a matter</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.479" end="00:05:31.680" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.720" end="00:05:33.199" style="s2">at what point are you know are we ready</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.680" end="00:05:34.800" style="s2">to address it properly</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.199" end="00:05:36.560" style="s2">well that strategy is agnostic with</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.800" end="00:05:38.960" style="s2">regard to vaccine as</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.560" end="00:05:40.720" style="s2">you know as everything we have said</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.960" end="00:05:42.080" style="s2">pretty much has been because we began</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.720" end="00:05:44.720" style="s2">back in march</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.080" end="00:05:45.520" style="s2">by saying uh we hope that a vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.720" end="00:05:48.400" style="s2">comes</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.520" end="00:05:49.680" style="s2">uh but none of us should assume that it</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.400" end="00:05:52.800" style="s2">will</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.680" end="00:05:55.360" style="s2">soon or even ever so uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.800" end="00:05:56.960" style="s2">we we cannot make strategy based on the</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.360" end="00:05:58.560" style="s2">assumption that we will have a vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.960" end="00:05:59.520" style="s2">anytime soon because there&#39;s just no</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.560" end="00:06:03.600" style="s2">guarantee of that</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.520" end="00:06:04.720" style="s2">at all um so the second question here if</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.600" end="00:06:06.000" style="s2">the entire first round of vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.720" end="00:06:08.000" style="s2">candidates fails well lockdown still</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.000" end="00:06:09.360" style="s2">makes sense i think there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.000" end="00:06:10.560" style="s2">causal relationship between these two</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.360" end="00:06:12.240" style="s2">phrases that doesn&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.560" end="00:06:14.319" style="s2">match with our sense you know well</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.240" end="00:06:18.080" style="s2">lockdown still makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.319" end="00:06:21.360" style="s2">like brett just said an actual rigorous</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.080" end="00:06:24.880" style="s2">hardcore lockdown that really reduced</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.360" end="00:06:26.000" style="s2">uh this thing to almost zero</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.880" end="00:06:28.319" style="s2">would put us in a very different</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.000" end="00:06:30.960" style="s2">situation that his that</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.319" end="00:06:32.639" style="s2">is just a separate way forward from</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.960" end="00:06:34.560" style="s2">depending on vaccines</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.639" end="00:06:36.240" style="s2">and then should should schools stay</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.560" end="00:06:37.759" style="s2">closed for 10 years</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.240" end="00:06:39.600" style="s2">no you know humans aren&#39;t going to live</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.759" end="00:06:40.400" style="s2">like this for 10 years humans humans</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.600" end="00:06:42.160" style="s2">can&#39;t we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.400" end="00:06:43.759" style="s2">we would we would fully destroy a whole</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.160" end="00:06:45.199" style="s2">generation of children and</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.759" end="00:06:46.560" style="s2">and their families you know there are a</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.199" end="00:06:48.319" style="s2">lot of families that can&#39;t do this</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.560" end="00:06:49.759" style="s2">economically much less psychologically</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.319" end="00:06:52.240" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.759" end="00:06:53.199" style="s2">or mentally at all it&#39;s just it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.240" end="00:06:55.919" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.199" end="00:06:57.199" style="s2">sustainable in any way and um as you and</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.919" end="00:07:00.479" style="s2">i were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.199" end="00:07:02.000" style="s2">um let&#39;s play that through fully</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.479" end="00:07:03.919" style="s2">we&#39;ve got some countries that have done</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.000" end="00:07:04.880" style="s2">away with this thing we&#39;ve got other</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.919" end="00:07:06.960" style="s2">countries who will</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.880" end="00:07:09.039" style="s2">be able to do so and if we are going to</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.960" end="00:07:09.520" style="s2">simply shoot ourselves in the foot and</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.039" end="00:07:11.759" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.520" end="00:07:12.800" style="s2">deal with it we will be isolated by the</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.759" end="00:07:16.080" style="s2">world and</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.800" end="00:07:17.440" style="s2">um we can&#39;t have that either so yep</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.080" end="00:07:19.360" style="s2">there&#39;s every reason for us to get</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.440" end="00:07:20.960" style="s2">serious about this and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.360" end="00:07:22.639" style="s2">you know it&#39;s just like quitting smoking</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.960" end="00:07:24.160" style="s2">the fact that it&#39;s difficult doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.639" end="00:07:25.680" style="s2">mean this isn&#39;t the time to do it it</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.160" end="00:07:27.199" style="s2">means this is exactly the time to do it</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.680" end="00:07:31.280" style="s2">because it&#39;s only going to get harder</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.199" end="00:07:34.479" style="s2">yeah okay questions from</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.280" end="00:07:36.960" style="s2">episode 32 that just ended uh</p>

<p begin="00:07:59.199" end="00:08:03.120" style="s2">girlfriend is annoyed about you using</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.800" end="00:08:04.639" style="s2">this sjw term asian fetish</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.120" end="00:08:06.879" style="s2">asians are attractive and competitive</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.639" end="00:08:08.879" style="s2">fair and square not a fetish</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.879" end="00:08:10.000" style="s2">100 but that&#39;s not to say that there</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.879" end="00:08:13.360" style="s2">isn&#39;t also</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.000" end="00:08:15.039" style="s2">a niche group of people who</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.360" end="00:08:16.479" style="s2">treat people with this particular</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.039" end="00:08:20.639" style="s2">demographic as a fetish</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.479" end="00:08:22.400" style="s2">yeah yeah both both things are true yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.639" end="00:08:25.120" style="s2">that&#39;s all is it fair that if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.400" end="00:08:26.400" style="s2">googling on that basis that you that you</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.120" end="00:08:29.680" style="s2">are fetishizing</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.400" end="00:08:29.680" style="s2">i think that&#39;s a fair standard</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.720" end="00:08:33.919" style="s2">i don&#39;t know i&#39;m not sure about that not</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.519" end="00:08:35.519" style="s2">sure</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.919" end="00:08:38.719" style="s2">it&#39;s obviously not technically a fetish</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.519" end="00:08:42.320" style="s2">yeah but i think speaking colloquially</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.719" end="00:08:43.360" style="s2">it might be no i&#39;m not sure of that but</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.320" end="00:08:45.920" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.360" end="00:08:48.160" style="s2">i&#39;m ready to talk about that right now</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.920" end="00:08:50.399" style="s2">regarding linguistics and thought</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.160" end="00:08:51.200" style="s2">a word categorizes things into in-out</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.399" end="00:08:53.920" style="s2">categories</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.200" end="00:08:55.760" style="s2">and semantics relate those categories it</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.920" end="00:08:57.360" style="s2">presumably meaning semantics</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.760" end="00:08:59.839" style="s2">shifts thinking from holistic to</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.360" end="00:09:01.279" style="s2">categorical it doesn&#39;t define thinking</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.839" end="00:09:05.040" style="s2">but shifts it</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.279" end="00:09:08.160" style="s2">what are your thoughts so</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.040" end="00:09:11.200" style="s2">um semantics</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.160" end="00:09:12.800" style="s2">shifts thinking from holistic to</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.200" end="00:09:14.240" style="s2">categorical</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.800" end="00:09:16.880" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure i&#39;m not actually sure i</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.240" end="00:09:18.399" style="s2">follow i follow this i think i mean i</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.880" end="00:09:21.120" style="s2">think semantics does</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.399" end="00:09:22.640" style="s2">i think semantics shifts thinking for</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.120" end="00:09:23.839" style="s2">sure and this is in response to what we</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.640" end="00:09:24.959" style="s2">were saying about the sapir war</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.839" end="00:09:28.640" style="s2">hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.959" end="00:09:31.440" style="s2">last hour but um it seems like a word</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.640" end="00:09:32.880" style="s2">creates the categories and yet the</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.440" end="00:09:34.320" style="s2">argument here is that semantics is</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.880" end="00:09:36.000" style="s2">shifting thinking from holistic to</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.320" end="00:09:37.360" style="s2">categorical when it&#39;s that&#39;s the words</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.000" end="00:09:39.120" style="s2">that are being claimed to have done so i</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.360" end="00:09:41.040" style="s2">think that claim is right that words are</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.120" end="00:09:44.240" style="s2">these categorical bins</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.040" end="00:09:46.399" style="s2">um but semantics would seem to</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.240" end="00:09:47.440" style="s2">create the connections between those</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.399" end="00:09:50.640" style="s2">bins</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.440" end="00:09:51.680" style="s2">rather than reducing them further i</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.640" end="00:09:52.880" style="s2">think it goes in the other direction</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.680" end="00:09:54.640" style="s2">it&#39;s shifting thinking from</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.880" end="00:09:56.320" style="s2">categorical to more holistic to more</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.640" end="00:09:59.760" style="s2">connected well</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.320" end="00:10:01.680" style="s2">i think at some level i see the uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.760" end="00:10:03.440" style="s2">the point of the question and i think it</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.680" end="00:10:05.920" style="s2">happens but i also think that</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.440" end="00:10:06.720" style="s2">language naturally allows us to deal</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.920" end="00:10:10.880" style="s2">with this</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.720" end="00:10:13.680" style="s2">so um you know we have things like uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.880" end="00:10:15.519" style="s2">you know a liquid versus a solid lots of</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.680" end="00:10:17.200" style="s2">things are easily categorized that way</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.519" end="00:10:18.720" style="s2">and so we tend to over believe in those</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.200" end="00:10:21.200" style="s2">two categories when there are things</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.720" end="00:10:24.079" style="s2">that defy them</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.200" end="00:10:25.680" style="s2">and you know likewise uh you know we</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.079" end="00:10:28.800" style="s2">tend to see the sun as</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.680" end="00:10:30.640" style="s2">you know fire right even though it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.800" end="00:10:31.920" style="s2">combustion that&#39;s happening there</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.640" end="00:10:32.959" style="s2">okay but where&#39;s the semantics and what</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.920" end="00:10:34.800" style="s2">you&#39;re saying that&#39;s all words that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.959" end="00:10:37.519" style="s2">all categories and categories</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.800" end="00:10:39.519" style="s2">are almost always have fuzzy boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.519" end="00:10:42.640" style="s2">especially the more complex the system</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.519" end="00:10:44.320" style="s2">and categories can be uh hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.640" end="00:10:45.360" style="s2">and embedded and have nested sets in all</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.320" end="00:10:47.839" style="s2">of this but none of</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.360" end="00:10:49.200" style="s2">you know liquid and solid and fire and</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.839" end="00:10:50.399" style="s2">sun those are all words which are</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.200" end="00:10:52.320" style="s2">categories those don&#39;t have anything to</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.399" end="00:10:54.000" style="s2">do with semantics</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.320" end="00:10:55.519" style="s2">well i mean you&#39;re right and i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.000" end="00:10:56.480" style="s2">defend it at the level of the semantics</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.519" end="00:10:58.399" style="s2">but i do think</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.480" end="00:10:59.680" style="s2">uh you would find if we extended it that</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.399" end="00:11:01.440" style="s2">way and we you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.680" end="00:11:03.440" style="s2">spent a couple of hours playing with</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.440" end="00:11:06.480" style="s2">examples i think we would find ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.440" end="00:11:08.079" style="s2">limited to belief systems that actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.480" end="00:11:09.519" style="s2">blinded us to certain things as they</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.079" end="00:11:12.320" style="s2">highlighted other things</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.519" end="00:11:14.480" style="s2">true um but the basic answer is once you</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.320" end="00:11:18.800" style="s2">discover that your category</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.480" end="00:11:20.160" style="s2">has a you know a breach in the boundary</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.800" end="00:11:22.160" style="s2">language allows you to deal with that</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.160" end="00:11:23.040" style="s2">too so yes it&#39;s a tool and it has its</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.160" end="00:11:26.160" style="s2">limits but</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.040" end="00:11:27.360" style="s2">um it&#39;s not surprising that there ain&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.160" end="00:11:29.920" style="s2">anything you can&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.360" end="00:11:31.120" style="s2">right it may take you a book to explain</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.920" end="00:11:33.920" style="s2">the meaning of some</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.120" end="00:11:35.440" style="s2">thing that then becomes a sentence but</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.920" end="00:11:36.399" style="s2">but you can get there and once you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.440" end="00:11:38.160" style="s2">done it then</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.399" end="00:11:42.640" style="s2">language allows you to convey that thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.160" end="00:11:46.399" style="s2">too absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.640" end="00:11:49.200" style="s2">nba games played on blm floors with blm</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.399" end="00:11:51.279" style="s2">slogans will soon be aired in china</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.200" end="00:11:53.440" style="s2">will this not aid chinese anti-us</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.279" end="00:11:55.360" style="s2">propaganda</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.440" end="00:11:57.040" style="s2">do oh i don&#39;t know how to pronounce</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.360" end="00:11:58.160" style="s2">eager uyghur i always mispronounce that</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.040" end="00:12:00.959" style="s2">do we go our lives</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.160" end="00:12:00.959" style="s2">not matter</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.839" end="00:12:05.760" style="s2">i mean those are really two very</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.040" end="00:12:07.519" style="s2">different questions yeah very very very</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.760" end="00:12:08.800" style="s2">different questions let&#39;s take them as</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.519" end="00:12:10.639" style="s2">as separate</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.800" end="00:12:12.639" style="s2">um so the observation which i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.639" end="00:12:14.160" style="s2">know that nba game well presumably</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.639" end="00:12:15.680" style="s2">you know if i thought about it nba games</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.160" end="00:12:18.399" style="s2">are aired in china fair enough</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.680" end="00:12:20.240" style="s2">and the nba has decided that uh the</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.399" end="00:12:22.240" style="s2">floors</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.240" end="00:12:23.279" style="s2">uh in at least some places i think not</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.240" end="00:12:26.000" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.279" end="00:12:27.519" style="s2">but are going to have blm slogans black</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.000" end="00:12:30.320" style="s2">lives matter slogans on them</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.519" end="00:12:31.440" style="s2">and so china will be seeing chinese</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.320" end="00:12:34.639" style="s2">people will see that and</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.440" end="00:12:37.760" style="s2">that may basically provide aid</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.639" end="00:12:40.880" style="s2">to the chinese chinese communist party</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.760" end="00:12:42.320" style="s2">in creating anti-us propaganda yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.880" end="00:12:45.200" style="s2">i see very little to argue with there</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.320" end="00:12:46.079" style="s2">yep um and then do weaker lives not</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.200" end="00:12:47.920" style="s2">matter</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.079" end="00:12:50.000" style="s2">um you know it seems to me that the</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.920" end="00:12:51.600" style="s2">relationship that is being implied</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.000" end="00:12:53.920" style="s2">by putting these questions next to each</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.600" end="00:12:57.040" style="s2">other is um</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.920" end="00:12:59.279" style="s2">what is wrong with us that uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.040" end="00:13:00.720" style="s2">we cannot see outside of our own borders</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.279" end="00:13:04.079" style="s2">um to actual</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.720" end="00:13:06.480" style="s2">real ongoing genocides that appear to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.079" end="00:13:07.440" style="s2">imminent if not already underway and are</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.480" end="00:13:10.320" style="s2">importing</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.440" end="00:13:11.600" style="s2">our own um not what it appears and not</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.320" end="00:13:15.680" style="s2">as it is named</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.600" end="00:13:16.959" style="s2">uh protests into the homes of people who</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.680" end="00:13:19.360" style="s2">may actually be</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.959" end="00:13:20.959" style="s2">wondering how it is that they can resist</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.360" end="00:13:23.440" style="s2">an actual genocide</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.959" end="00:13:25.519" style="s2">and if we can connect the two things as</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.440" end="00:13:26.959" style="s2">we hobble ourselves we enable the people</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.519" end="00:13:30.079" style="s2">who are engaged in</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.959" end="00:13:33.279" style="s2">what is a pre-genocide against the</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.079" end="00:13:36.160" style="s2">weak are muslims so uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.279" end="00:13:37.360" style="s2">why why would we empower them right we</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.160" end="00:13:39.360" style="s2">are going to</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.360" end="00:13:42.800" style="s2">reduce our own power empower them and</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.360" end="00:13:46.160" style="s2">then they will inevitably export that</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.800" end="00:13:48.800" style="s2">uh insane and despicable belief system</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.160" end="00:13:50.800" style="s2">globally so it&#39;s unacceptable we have an</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.800" end="00:13:52.639" style="s2">obligation not to do this to ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.800" end="00:13:54.720" style="s2">no and you know it&#39;s it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.639" end="00:13:57.040" style="s2">really easy to make the claim then</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.720" end="00:13:58.079" style="s2">that what we&#39;re doing uh is in fact</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.040" end="00:14:01.680" style="s2">increasing</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.079" end="00:14:02.560" style="s2">uh the legacy of racism and genocide in</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.680" end="00:14:05.760" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.560" end="00:14:05.760" style="s2">by by doing this</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.000" end="00:14:11.279" style="s2">that&#39;s the dog i was wondering if you</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.120" end="00:14:12.959" style="s2">have an opinion on quadratic voting</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.279" end="00:14:14.320" style="s2">as presented in the book radical markets</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.959" end="00:14:14.959" style="s2">as a solution to rent seeking in</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.320" end="00:14:16.959" style="s2">politics</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.959" end="00:14:19.360" style="s2">thanks and keep up the good work i have</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.959" end="00:14:21.040" style="s2">not read read radical markets nor am i</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.360" end="00:14:21.600" style="s2">familiar with the concept of quadratic</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.040" end="00:14:24.000" style="s2">voting</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.600" end="00:14:25.839" style="s2">i can only say that i&#39;ve heard the term</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.000" end="00:14:27.279" style="s2">quadratic voting and if i did know what</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.839" end="00:14:29.120" style="s2">it was i have forgotten so</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.279" end="00:14:30.480" style="s2">i guess we have to look into that before</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.120" end="00:14:34.560" style="s2">we can say anything intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.480" end="00:14:37.839" style="s2">fair enough uh dog butt on screen now</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.560" end="00:14:39.519" style="s2">oh no um</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.839" end="00:14:41.760" style="s2">a good explanation of this phenomenon in</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.519" end="00:14:44.880" style="s2">our culture</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.760" end="00:14:46.399" style="s2">this phenomenon i don&#39;t see if this is i</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.880" end="00:14:48.079" style="s2">don&#39;t see what this is relating to</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.399" end="00:14:49.440" style="s2">a good explanation of this phenomenon in</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.079" end="00:14:52.320" style="s2">our culture can be put into historical</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.440" end="00:14:55.040" style="s2">perspective by reading ray</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.320" end="00:14:56.880" style="s2">dalio i think it says book called</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.040" end="00:14:58.160" style="s2">principles which summarizes the economic</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.880" end="00:15:00.560" style="s2">decline of previous government</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.160" end="00:15:02.880" style="s2">over time the us is following the same</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.560" end="00:15:04.320" style="s2">trend</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.880" end="00:15:06.160" style="s2">about this no i don&#39;t i do think that</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.320" end="00:15:08.079" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot to be said for these</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.160" end="00:15:10.639" style="s2">large-scale patterns in history</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.079" end="00:15:11.600" style="s2">um being predictable you and i have</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.639" end="00:15:14.560" style="s2">talked about</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.600" end="00:15:16.240" style="s2">the strong possibility that long-lasting</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.560" end="00:15:17.760" style="s2">cultures especially temple building</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.240" end="00:15:19.279" style="s2">cultures knew something that the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.760" end="00:15:20.959" style="s2">us don&#39;t about how to</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.279" end="00:15:22.720" style="s2">avoid these kinds of patterns or at</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.959" end="00:15:25.360" style="s2">least stave them off for</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.720" end="00:15:26.000" style="s2">thousands of years so anyway there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.360" end="00:15:27.360" style="s2">lot to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.000" end="00:15:29.680" style="s2">said there but no i can&#39;t speak to the</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.360" end="00:15:31.040" style="s2">specifics of it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.680" end="00:15:32.720" style="s2">isn&#39;t the problem not so much that the</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.040" end="00:15:33.920" style="s2">feds are there but that they are not</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.720" end="00:15:36.240" style="s2">identifying themselves</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.920" end="00:15:37.759" style="s2">as such this is a tactic used by</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.240" end="00:15:39.279" style="s2">security forces and undemocratic</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.759" end="00:15:40.079" style="s2">countries like china and russia and is</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.279" end="00:15:43.440" style="s2">being challenged</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.079" end="00:15:44.880" style="s2">legally as unconstitutional</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.440" end="00:15:46.480" style="s2">i think we have a martin bailey</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.880" end="00:15:49.600" style="s2">situation here i think that is</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.480" end="00:15:50.399" style="s2">one of the legitimate challenges that is</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.600" end="00:15:54.000" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.399" end="00:15:56.000" style="s2">levied against against those officers</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.000" end="00:15:57.440" style="s2">who are not in fact identified</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.000" end="00:16:00.240" style="s2">themselves as such</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.440" end="00:16:00.880" style="s2">um but is clearly not the only argument</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.240" end="00:16:04.000" style="s2">against</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.880" end="00:16:06.560" style="s2">um the feds being in portland yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.000" end="00:16:07.440" style="s2">clearly not now i&#39;m not sure why they</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.560" end="00:16:11.120" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.440" end="00:16:12.399" style="s2">um not labeled that presumably has a</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.120" end="00:16:13.920" style="s2">tactical meaning</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.399" end="00:16:15.600" style="s2">um in other words it might be impossible</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.920" end="00:16:17.600" style="s2">for them to do what they</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.600" end="00:16:19.279" style="s2">are doing if they were clearly</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.600" end="00:16:20.959" style="s2">identifiable though it sounds to me like</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.279" end="00:16:23.360" style="s2">they are clearly identifiable based on</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.959" end="00:16:25.920" style="s2">the fact that they&#39;re in fatigues</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.360" end="00:16:28.320" style="s2">yeah i gotta say this this part of this</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.920" end="00:16:30.800" style="s2">this story i have i do not</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.320" end="00:16:32.480" style="s2">even really have a sense of which side</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.800" end="00:16:33.440" style="s2">of the various stories that we&#39;ve heard</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.480" end="00:16:36.160" style="s2">is accurate</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.440" end="00:16:37.759" style="s2">i have heard very clearly from from both</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.160" end="00:16:39.440" style="s2">sides</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.759" end="00:16:41.040" style="s2">they&#39;re absolutely not identifiable you</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.440" end="00:16:43.360" style="s2">can&#39;t tell they&#39;re police there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.040" end="00:16:44.240" style="s2">there&#39;s no markings at all and other</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.360" end="00:16:46.399" style="s2">people saying</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.240" end="00:16:47.680" style="s2">they&#39;re clearly marked in a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.399" end="00:16:50.880" style="s2">different places</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.680" end="00:16:52.800" style="s2">and you know the few videos i&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.880" end="00:16:53.920" style="s2">i i feel like i ca i just can&#39;t tell i</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.800" end="00:16:55.120" style="s2">see i see both</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.920" end="00:16:56.240" style="s2">you know so is it possible that some</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.120" end="00:16:57.360" style="s2">people aren&#39;t marked at all and some</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.240" end="00:16:59.199" style="s2">people are clearly marked i</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.360" end="00:17:00.399" style="s2">i honestly do not know what the truth is</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.199" end="00:17:02.800" style="s2">here i don&#39;t know yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.399" end="00:17:04.559" style="s2">i certainly see a problem with it uh in</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.800" end="00:17:06.799" style="s2">the sense that um</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.559" end="00:17:08.640" style="s2">if somebody who is not clearly labeled</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.799" end="00:17:09.600" style="s2">is dragging you into a car that is not</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.640" end="00:17:10.880" style="s2">clearly labeled</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.600" end="00:17:13.280" style="s2">you actually have a right to defend</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.880" end="00:17:14.880" style="s2">yourself yes right 100 i mean</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.280" end="00:17:16.640" style="s2">or you know are they identifying</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.880" end="00:17:18.000" style="s2">themselves verbally in which case can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.640" end="00:17:19.520" style="s2">anybody identify themselves</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.000" end="00:17:21.039" style="s2">and you know at least something at least</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.520" end="00:17:23.439" style="s2">you gotta be able to flash something</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.039" end="00:17:25.120" style="s2">yeah it seems like an ambiguity that uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.439" end="00:17:27.120" style="s2">can only create</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.120" end="00:17:28.480" style="s2">a disaster so i&#39;d be very curious what</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.120" end="00:17:30.400" style="s2">the rationale is</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.480" end="00:17:32.080" style="s2">i should also say i don&#39;t think we can</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.400" end="00:17:34.320" style="s2">be 100 certain</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.080" end="00:17:36.799" style="s2">about whether or not what we are seeing</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.320" end="00:17:39.919" style="s2">is the mechanism that was described in</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.799" end="00:17:41.600" style="s2">the first hour or whether this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.919" end="00:17:43.120" style="s2">one of these terrorism things i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.600" end="00:17:44.480" style="s2">think we know but i think it is</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.120" end="00:17:47.360" style="s2">important to know</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.480" end="00:17:48.559" style="s2">that there is a rationale whereby the</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.360" end="00:17:50.400" style="s2">federal government might</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.559" end="00:17:51.600" style="s2">not be invoking that and still be</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.400" end="00:17:52.880" style="s2">behaving this way</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.600" end="00:17:55.200" style="s2">which i would still expect to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.880" end="00:17:56.960" style="s2">challenged uh in court</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.200" end="00:17:58.240" style="s2">if court still even functions and i</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.960" end="00:17:59.679" style="s2">think we&#39;re going to find out very</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.240" end="00:18:00.160" style="s2">quickly that court is going to come</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.679" end="00:18:02.320" style="s2">apart</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.160" end="00:18:04.720" style="s2">based on the fact that these same wrong</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.320" end="00:18:06.320" style="s2">ideas are going to pervade courts and</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.720" end="00:18:08.080" style="s2">whether or not something is legal is</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.320" end="00:18:08.880" style="s2">going to depend very much on who has</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.080" end="00:18:12.559" style="s2">been accused</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.880" end="00:18:15.919" style="s2">and of what rather than it being</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.559" end="00:18:18.160" style="s2">blind which it must be but nonetheless</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.919" end="00:18:19.600" style="s2">the expected route would be to pursue it</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.160" end="00:18:20.960" style="s2">in court and to find out what the</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.600" end="00:18:22.080" style="s2">rationale is and to see whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.960" end="00:18:25.280" style="s2">constitutional</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.080" end="00:18:27.280" style="s2">yeah how might those under the</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.280" end="00:18:28.640" style="s2">microscope of protesters assuage the</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.280" end="00:18:30.559" style="s2">perceived lack of justice</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.640" end="00:18:32.880" style="s2">in cases like george floyd and brianna</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.559" end="00:18:36.080" style="s2">taylor in time to prevent outcomes</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.880" end="00:18:37.120" style="s2">such as mass rioting</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.080" end="00:18:39.360" style="s2">i feel like there might be a word</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.120" end="00:18:42.080" style="s2">missing here those under the microscope</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.360" end="00:18:45.520" style="s2">of protesters</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.080" end="00:18:47.919" style="s2">way to perceive lack of justice okay</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.520" end="00:18:49.440" style="s2">to prevent outcomes such as mass writing</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.919" end="00:18:52.720" style="s2">um oh i think how</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.440" end="00:18:55.520" style="s2">could this arresting thing be done such</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.720" end="00:18:56.799" style="s2">that there was the expectation that</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.520" end="00:18:58.960" style="s2">injustice was not</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.799" end="00:19:00.320" style="s2">occurring well but to prevent outcomes</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.960" end="00:19:01.840" style="s2">such as mass writing because what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.320" end="00:19:02.400" style="s2">happening now the mass writing has long</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.840" end="00:19:05.039" style="s2">since</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.400" end="00:19:06.240" style="s2">begun um so how you know how i think</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.039" end="00:19:07.600" style="s2">they&#39;re saying in principle how would</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.240" end="00:19:09.120" style="s2">you structure it so this didn&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.600" end="00:19:12.160" style="s2">again right</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.120" end="00:19:14.799" style="s2">um and you know things like body cams</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.160" end="00:19:16.240" style="s2">help right they at least allow us a</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.799" end="00:19:17.919" style="s2">there&#39;s the expectation that if you</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.240" end="00:19:19.600" style="s2">behave badly it will be captured and</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.919" end="00:19:21.679" style="s2">then it might come back to haunt you</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.600" end="00:19:23.679" style="s2">you know legally for example and in this</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.679" end="00:19:25.520" style="s2">case though we see something else which</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.679" end="00:19:29.200" style="s2">is as we described on the last</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.520" end="00:19:31.120" style="s2">live stream we have the transcript and</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.200" end="00:19:32.320" style="s2">it has not been widely discussed even</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.120" end="00:19:34.080" style="s2">though there&#39;s stuff in it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.320" end="00:19:35.679" style="s2">directly relevant to the question</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.080" end="00:19:37.760" style="s2">of what sort of injustice happened to</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.679" end="00:19:38.960" style="s2">george floyd well i mean this is a this</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.760" end="00:19:40.160" style="s2">is an issue that we&#39;ve brought up a lot</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.960" end="00:19:41.679" style="s2">of times is that the</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.160" end="00:19:43.919" style="s2">you know the visceral anecdote is more</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.679" end="00:19:46.320" style="s2">powerful than any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.919" end="00:19:47.200" style="s2">statistical population level analysis</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.320" end="00:19:49.760" style="s2">but even</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.200" end="00:19:50.240" style="s2">even more pointed with regard to this</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.760" end="00:19:52.400" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.240" end="00:19:54.080" style="s2">is that visuals are always going to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.400" end="00:19:54.960" style="s2">more powerful and more able to change</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.080" end="00:19:56.640" style="s2">people&#39;s minds</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.960" end="00:19:59.360" style="s2">and wreak havoc with their emotions than</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.640" end="00:20:01.200" style="s2">words right unless the words are seen</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.360" end="00:20:02.480" style="s2">being spoken by someone who&#39;s themselves</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.200" end="00:20:05.120" style="s2">emotional but</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.480" end="00:20:07.200" style="s2">a transcript without even any indicators</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.120" end="00:20:09.120" style="s2">of like being able to match it up with</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.200" end="00:20:09.760" style="s2">the videos that that we all have access</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.120" end="00:20:12.240" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.760" end="00:20:13.440" style="s2">uh is much harder to make sense of and</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.240" end="00:20:15.440" style="s2">all you know all we could say from</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.440" end="00:20:17.600" style="s2">reading through the transcripts was</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.440" end="00:20:19.679" style="s2">there&#39;s nuance there&#39;s complexity there</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.600" end="00:20:23.600" style="s2">that wasn&#39;t clear from the video</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.679" end="00:20:25.840" style="s2">and uh and that&#39;s that&#39;s all we could do</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.600" end="00:20:25.840" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.840" end="00:20:31.200" style="s2">brett lamented his physics and guitar</p>

<p begin="00:21:39.679" end="00:21:44.320" style="s2">be measured because it can be quantified</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.840" end="00:21:45.120" style="s2">it very quickly becomes the tool that is</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.320" end="00:21:48.080" style="s2">used</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.120" end="00:21:48.640" style="s2">i saw this very clearly anecdotally in</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.080" end="00:21:52.159" style="s2">my own</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.640" end="00:21:54.240" style="s2">musical training where um i was uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.159" end="00:21:56.400" style="s2">you know i i practice the piano two</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.240" end="00:21:58.960" style="s2">hours a day</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.400" end="00:22:00.080" style="s2">six days a week 50 weeks a year for 10</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.960" end="00:22:01.840" style="s2">years or so</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.080" end="00:22:03.600" style="s2">um it wasn&#39;t two hours a day for the</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.840" end="00:22:06.960" style="s2">first five of those years maybe</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.600" end="00:22:10.080" style="s2">but um i became very very very good uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.960" end="00:22:10.559" style="s2">but what i didn&#39;t have as a result of</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.080" end="00:22:14.000" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.559" end="00:22:14.799" style="s2">training really was nearly as much sense</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.000" end="00:22:17.280" style="s2">of the music</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.799" end="00:22:19.200" style="s2">as i would have had had there been some</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.280" end="00:22:20.559" style="s2">combination of yes you&#39;re going to spend</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.200" end="00:22:22.320" style="s2">a quarter of your practice time every</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.559" end="00:22:24.559" style="s2">day</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.320" end="00:22:26.080" style="s2">doing scales and arpeggios and you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.559" end="00:22:27.919" style="s2">basically working your fingers</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.080" end="00:22:29.520" style="s2">and knowing where they go and where the</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.919" end="00:22:32.640" style="s2">keys are and you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.520" end="00:22:33.200" style="s2">today&#39;s going to be you know today is</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.640" end="00:22:35.760" style="s2">going to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.200" end="00:22:36.880" style="s2">a major and g minor and tomorrow is</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.760" end="00:22:38.000" style="s2">going to you know just like you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.880" end="00:22:39.600" style="s2">going through</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.000" end="00:22:41.520" style="s2">all of these things over and over and</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.600" end="00:22:43.120" style="s2">over again that stuff needed to get into</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.520" end="00:22:44.159" style="s2">my head in order to do the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.120" end="00:22:46.320" style="s2">play the kind of music that i was</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.159" end="00:22:50.000" style="s2">playing but it also</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.320" end="00:22:52.799" style="s2">seemed to shut doors to other kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.000" end="00:22:54.000" style="s2">improv and and music production such</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.799" end="00:22:55.200" style="s2">that you know when your brother and i</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.000" end="00:22:57.280" style="s2">sit down together</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.200" end="00:22:58.559" style="s2">and he you know knows of my musical</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.280" end="00:23:00.000" style="s2">background and</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.559" end="00:23:01.440" style="s2">we try to do something together he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.000" end="00:23:03.440" style="s2">flabber he thinks that i&#39;m kidding i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.440" end="00:23:05.600" style="s2">like i can&#39;t do what you do eric i just</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.440" end="00:23:06.320" style="s2">i don&#39;t have it i don&#39;t have the ability</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.600" end="00:23:09.840" style="s2">to do</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.320" end="00:23:13.520" style="s2">what he does um and in part you know he</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.840" end="00:23:16.559" style="s2">he is entirely an autoduct musically</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.520" end="00:23:19.760" style="s2">yeah um you know a has just genius at it</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.559" end="00:23:23.120" style="s2">that i i don&#39;t but also</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.760" end="00:23:26.559" style="s2">um no avenues were cut off</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.120" end="00:23:27.120" style="s2">so the practice was absolutely a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.559" end="00:23:30.240" style="s2">percent</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.120" end="00:23:33.440" style="s2">valuable in some regards for me and</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.240" end="00:23:35.200" style="s2">it gave me a sense of understanding that</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.440" end="00:23:38.559" style="s2">you get up and you do the thing</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.200" end="00:23:40.240" style="s2">every day for a long time in order to</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.559" end="00:23:41.919" style="s2">get things with really long time</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.240" end="00:23:46.240" style="s2">horizons done</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.919" end="00:23:47.919" style="s2">which is a a skill that is very lacking</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.240" end="00:23:49.760" style="s2">in a lot of people now</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.919" end="00:23:51.360" style="s2">but it also closes doors to</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.760" end="00:23:53.120" style="s2">improvisation and creativity</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.360" end="00:23:54.400" style="s2">so we need a balance we need to be able</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.120" end="00:23:55.600" style="s2">to do both</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.400" end="00:23:57.679" style="s2">so i&#39;m going to take a little different</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.600" end="00:24:00.159" style="s2">position which is that when we say rote</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.679" end="00:24:01.279" style="s2">we mean the isolated version and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.159" end="00:24:04.080" style="s2">isolated version</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.279" end="00:24:05.440" style="s2">is almost inherently garbage and that</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.080" end="00:24:08.880" style="s2">there are certain things you have to</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.440" end="00:24:12.000" style="s2">memorize you know sohcahtoa right</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.880" end="00:24:14.159" style="s2">sokoto is necessary for trig there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.000" end="00:24:16.240" style="s2">really a good way to get there</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.159" end="00:24:17.600" style="s2">short of deriving everything you just</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.240" end="00:24:19.919" style="s2">have to remember it but</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.600" end="00:24:21.840" style="s2">in the context of trig it&#39;s not so</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.919" end="00:24:25.200" style="s2">painful because it&#39;s so immediately</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.840" end="00:24:27.840" style="s2">useful and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.200" end="00:24:29.760" style="s2">the rote thing is really an economically</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.840" end="00:24:34.080" style="s2">expedient way of</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.760" end="00:24:36.880" style="s2">occupying students and you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.080" end="00:24:38.080" style="s2">plausibly passing on something valuable</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.880" end="00:24:40.000" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.080" end="00:24:41.200" style="s2">none of this should look this way it</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.000" end="00:24:44.240" style="s2">should all look</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.200" end="00:24:45.360" style="s2">integrated with deep lessons that bring</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.240" end="00:24:47.200" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.360" end="00:24:48.559" style="s2">how many things in the world involve a</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.200" end="00:24:49.840" style="s2">certain amount of chemistry a certain</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.559" end="00:24:50.559" style="s2">amount of physics a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.840" end="00:24:52.880" style="s2">biology</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.559" end="00:24:53.600" style="s2">a certain amount of math you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.880" end="00:24:55.279" style="s2">integrated</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.600" end="00:24:57.279" style="s2">and that&#39;s the way it sticks in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.279" end="00:24:59.039" style="s2">brain so if you want to make geniuses</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.279" end="00:25:01.200" style="s2">that&#39;s what you do to schooling the road</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.039" end="00:25:02.880" style="s2">thing makes morons</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.200" end="00:25:04.400" style="s2">yeah and i will say i mean i think</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.880" end="00:25:06.960" style="s2">sokatoa is</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.400" end="00:25:08.159" style="s2">the right example in math space but um</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.960" end="00:25:11.120" style="s2">with regard to</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.159" end="00:25:12.400" style="s2">math so much of math is taught by rote</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.120" end="00:25:14.559" style="s2">in part because</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.400" end="00:25:16.480" style="s2">it is deemed and i don&#39;t know where</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.559" end="00:25:17.840" style="s2">these decisions are made but it&#39;s deemed</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.480" end="00:25:19.760" style="s2">the best way to do it but it&#39;s also in</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.840" end="00:25:21.120" style="s2">part because most math teachers</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.760" end="00:25:22.799" style="s2">don&#39;t have an intuitive and deep</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.120" end="00:25:24.880" style="s2">understanding of math they just aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.799" end="00:25:26.480" style="s2">mathematically inclined enough to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.880" end="00:25:27.279" style="s2">doing the job but we don&#39;t pay math</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.480" end="00:25:29.919" style="s2">teachers</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.279" end="00:25:31.440" style="s2">enough to get the people who really</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.919" end="00:25:33.440" style="s2">understand math at a deep level to go</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.440" end="00:25:34.799" style="s2">into teaching as opposed to going into</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.440" end="00:25:36.080" style="s2">you know highly quantitative fields</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.799" end="00:25:37.200" style="s2">where they can make a lot of money and</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.080" end="00:25:38.880" style="s2">make some sort of a difference in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.200" end="00:25:42.240" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.880" end="00:25:43.360" style="s2">but i would bring because i had a</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.240" end="00:25:45.279" style="s2">mathematician</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.360" end="00:25:47.120" style="s2">and computer scientist for a father and</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.279" end="00:25:48.799" style="s2">i loved math and he loved math and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.120" end="00:25:50.240" style="s2">way that his brain worked was coincident</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.799" end="00:25:52.159" style="s2">with mine</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.240" end="00:25:53.600" style="s2">i would bring my math homework home and</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.159" end="00:25:55.200" style="s2">he would look at it and i don&#39;t think he</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.600" end="00:25:57.760" style="s2">ever literally ripped it up</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.200" end="00:25:59.440" style="s2">but he would say this is this is stupid</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.760" end="00:26:01.039" style="s2">this is ridiculous how they&#39;re teaching</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.440" end="00:26:02.720" style="s2">it to you is going to make you dumber</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.039" end="00:26:04.159" style="s2">and we&#39;re not doing it that way</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.720" end="00:26:06.240" style="s2">we&#39;re going to logic through it and</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.159" end="00:26:07.600" style="s2">we&#39;re going to you know we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.240" end="00:26:10.080" style="s2">do it right</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.600" end="00:26:10.960" style="s2">and i kept my math brain and most people</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.080" end="00:26:12.640" style="s2">didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.960" end="00:26:14.480" style="s2">and i had the same teachers as everyone</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.640" end="00:26:15.279" style="s2">else except that i also had my father</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.480" end="00:26:17.679" style="s2">who said</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.279" end="00:26:18.320" style="s2">no to the rote mnemonics memorization</p>

<p begin="00:26:18.320" end="00:26:21.679" style="s2">we&#39;re going to talk about why it is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.919" end="00:26:23.440" style="s2">way it is because this is math and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.679" end="00:26:26.559" style="s2">just true</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.440" end="00:26:28.159" style="s2">now next</p>

<p begin="00:26:54.960" end="00:26:57.440" style="s2">countries i mean those are all</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.840" end="00:27:00.000" style="s2">english-speaking countries</p>

<p begin="00:27:00.960" end="00:27:04.720" style="s2">all i&#39;m getting at is everything&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.880" end="00:27:06.880" style="s2">the table there&#39;s a question about how</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.720" end="00:27:07.360" style="s2">you do it and what failures it reveals</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.880" end="00:27:09.919" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.360" end="00:27:11.760" style="s2">things like that so you know i mean</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.919" end="00:27:14.240" style="s2">black intellectual roundtable was</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.760" end="00:27:15.039" style="s2">a bunch of people not functioning in</p>

<p begin="00:27:15.039" end="00:27:19.200" style="s2">briefly people liked it does it catch on</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.200" end="00:27:20.880" style="s2">and become something i don&#39;t know but</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.200" end="00:27:22.240" style="s2">this i mean this this presumes a</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.880" end="00:27:23.279" style="s2">different kind of silo which is english</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.240" end="00:27:24.640" style="s2">speaking which of course</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.279" end="00:27:25.840" style="s2">is you know something we&#39;ve now been</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.640" end="00:27:27.200" style="s2">talking about that we&#39;re limited by</p>

<p begin="00:28:08.880" end="00:28:14.559" style="s2">weird lands on the branch of sanity yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.720" end="00:28:16.159" style="s2">okay maybe maybe they&#39;re asking for</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.559" end="00:28:17.600" style="s2">doesn&#39;t fall</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.159" end="00:28:19.279" style="s2">something that&#39;s not enough it&#39;s not you</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.600" end="00:28:22.080" style="s2">need two more syllables damn so we can</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.279" end="00:28:22.080" style="s2">get more syllables</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.399" end="00:28:28.480" style="s2">what&#39;s the go with nostalgia what does</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.159" end="00:28:31.200" style="s2">it mean what is its purpose</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.480" end="00:28:31.679" style="s2">what&#39;s the go with nostalgia what does</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.200" end="00:28:32.880" style="s2">that mean</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.679" end="00:28:35.039" style="s2">i think it means what&#39;s the deal with</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.880" end="00:28:36.000" style="s2">nostalgia oh what&#39;s the deal with</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.039" end="00:28:37.840" style="s2">nostalgia</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.000" end="00:28:41.039" style="s2">i don&#39;t know it&#39;s a good question um</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.840" end="00:28:41.039" style="s2">what&#39;s the deal with nostalgia</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.360" end="00:28:46.000" style="s2">uh well i guess there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.640" end="00:28:48.720" style="s2">look there&#39;s two ways we can go with</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.000" end="00:28:49.360" style="s2">this there&#39;s going to be some nostalgia</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.720" end="00:28:51.760" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.360" end="00:28:52.559" style="s2">adaptive that is to say a discovery that</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.760" end="00:28:54.559" style="s2">something that</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.559" end="00:28:55.760" style="s2">was is actually better than whatever</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.559" end="00:28:58.799" style="s2">you&#39;ve arrived at</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.760" end="00:29:00.000" style="s2">and some desire to return to it there</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.799" end="00:29:02.159" style="s2">might also be</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.000" end="00:29:03.039" style="s2">temporary it might be that your</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.159" end="00:29:06.000" style="s2">nostalgia</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.039" end="00:29:07.600" style="s2">can be satisfied on a relatively limited</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.000" end="00:29:08.880" style="s2">basis so maybe you need to go back</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.600" end="00:29:11.520" style="s2">somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.880" end="00:29:12.960" style="s2">to recapture something right some mental</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.520" end="00:29:14.559" style="s2">process that you left behind and you</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.960" end="00:29:17.279" style="s2">need to return to some</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.559" end="00:29:19.279" style="s2">prior state in order to pick up whatever</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.279" end="00:29:21.600" style="s2">it was to get the value out of it</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.279" end="00:29:22.640" style="s2">um and then there&#39;s also uh the</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.600" end="00:29:24.159" style="s2">possibility that</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.640" end="00:29:26.240" style="s2">there&#39;s something maladaptive that the</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.159" end="00:29:29.360" style="s2">familiar triggers lots of</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.240" end="00:29:30.640" style="s2">uh circuitry that can&#39;t help but be</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.360" end="00:29:33.120" style="s2">drawn in</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.640" end="00:29:33.919" style="s2">and and that it&#39;s counterproductive i</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.120" end="00:29:36.799" style="s2">would bet</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.919" end="00:29:41.840" style="s2">the latter happens but that it is driven</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.799" end="00:29:41.840" style="s2">by the existence of the first two</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.480" end="00:29:45.919" style="s2">have you seen the rebel wisdom episode</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.000" end="00:29:47.440" style="s2">with thomas bjorkman he thinks that we</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.919" end="00:29:48.880" style="s2">are approaching a societal shift like</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.440" end="00:29:51.120" style="s2">the move to cities</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.880" end="00:29:53.039" style="s2">could this equity push facilitate such a</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.120" end="00:29:54.799" style="s2">societal push could the policies of</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.039" end="00:29:58.240" style="s2">unity 2020</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.799" end="00:29:59.440" style="s2">facilitate this yeah of course</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.240" end="00:30:01.279" style="s2">have you seen the episode i haven&#39;t seen</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.440" end="00:30:02.480" style="s2">it i have seen only the first few</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.279" end="00:30:06.480" style="s2">minutes okay</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.480" end="00:30:09.120" style="s2">um i think the fact is we are stuck</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.480" end="00:30:09.600" style="s2">our system is stuck refusing to change</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.120" end="00:30:11.600" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.600" end="00:30:12.720" style="s2">the corrupt opportunities are so</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.600" end="00:30:15.120" style="s2">glorious for</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.720" end="00:30:17.760" style="s2">those who accumulate power and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.120" end="00:30:19.360" style="s2">cause the system to stick permanently</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.760" end="00:30:21.200" style="s2">so if you cleared that away what would</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.360" end="00:30:22.799" style="s2">we find out that we should be doing</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.200" end="00:30:24.559" style="s2">that&#39;s really the question</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.799" end="00:30:26.240" style="s2">um that&#39;s not a question that will be</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.559" end="00:30:27.840" style="s2">quickly answered but we would start</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.240" end="00:30:29.520" style="s2">moving in the direction to something if</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.840" end="00:30:30.880" style="s2">we could simply strip the corruption out</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.520" end="00:30:31.440" style="s2">of the system that chooses where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.880" end="00:30:34.640" style="s2">headed</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.440" end="00:30:36.080" style="s2">now and so yeah there&#39;s something a lot</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.640" end="00:30:38.799" style="s2">of us think that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.080" end="00:30:39.679" style="s2">phase transition that is poised to</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.799" end="00:30:41.200" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.679" end="00:30:43.360" style="s2">i&#39;ve said it would take three</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.200" end="00:30:44.960" style="s2">generations to get where we are going</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.360" end="00:30:45.840" style="s2">that we could start very quickly but it</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.960" end="00:30:48.320" style="s2">would take</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.840" end="00:30:49.760" style="s2">a lot of time just based on the way</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.320" end="00:30:53.039" style="s2">human development works</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.760" end="00:30:54.480" style="s2">to get a new system and a generation</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.039" end="00:30:57.760" style="s2">that was native to it</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.480" end="00:31:00.720" style="s2">we will be expats in that new system if</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.760" end="00:31:02.080" style="s2">and when it happens for two generations</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.720" end="00:31:03.039" style="s2">so anyway yeah these things are quite</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.080" end="00:31:05.120" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.039" end="00:31:06.640" style="s2">it&#39;s not the point of unity 2020. the</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.120" end="00:31:08.559" style="s2">point of unity 2020</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.640" end="00:31:10.159" style="s2">is to strip away the corruption but i</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.559" end="00:31:11.519" style="s2">have no doubt that if you did that</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.159" end="00:31:13.679" style="s2">we would find that there was a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.519" end="00:31:17.600" style="s2">opportunity that we&#39;ve been blinded to</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.679" end="00:31:17.600" style="s2">and we&#39;d be fools to miss it</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.679" end="00:31:22.000" style="s2">next question we had a similar story in</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.519" end="00:31:23.120" style="s2">the uk the lefty bbc screened a</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.000" end="00:31:25.279" style="s2">documentary on the fact that the</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.120" end="00:31:27.120" style="s2">countryside is racist they claimed</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.279" end="00:31:28.960" style="s2">there was a campaign in the uk to defund</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.120" end="00:31:30.480" style="s2">the bbc which is funded through a</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.960" end="00:31:33.760" style="s2">household tax</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.480" end="00:31:37.120" style="s2">should they defund</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.760" end="00:31:41.120" style="s2">no i would say not but uh the bbc</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.120" end="00:31:45.200" style="s2">like in the us npr and pbs</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.120" end="00:31:48.559" style="s2">clearly has a political bent and</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.200" end="00:31:51.519" style="s2">a publicly funded organization</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.559" end="00:31:52.640" style="s2">um should not be so eager to embrace a</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.519" end="00:31:54.000" style="s2">political bent</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.640" end="00:31:56.399" style="s2">what do you do about it though you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.000" end="00:31:58.320" style="s2">the bbc npr pbs</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.399" end="00:32:00.080" style="s2">aren&#39;t going to be unpolitically bent</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.320" end="00:32:02.159" style="s2">anytime soon on the other hand i know</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.080" end="00:32:04.640" style="s2">less obviously about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.159" end="00:32:06.159" style="s2">how the bbc has shifted over the last</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.640" end="00:32:10.080" style="s2">say 20 years</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.159" end="00:32:12.240" style="s2">but um i certainly have found that npr</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.080" end="00:32:15.600" style="s2">became unlistenable for me</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.240" end="00:32:17.519" style="s2">by the early aughts where i had been um</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.600" end="00:32:18.799" style="s2">it it had been a primary source of my</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.519" end="00:32:20.000" style="s2">news</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.799" end="00:32:22.240" style="s2">from you know sort of high school</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.000" end="00:32:25.360" style="s2">through graduate grad school and</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.240" end="00:32:29.360" style="s2">by the time really by 9 11</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.360" end="00:32:31.919" style="s2">pretty much um it was it was becoming</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.360" end="00:32:33.039" style="s2">so patently political such that you</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.919" end="00:32:34.880" style="s2">could predict what its</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.039" end="00:32:36.159" style="s2">take on a story was going to be before</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.880" end="00:32:37.840" style="s2">you ever listened</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.159" end="00:32:39.440" style="s2">um that there was very little reason to</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.840" end="00:32:40.799" style="s2">listen and that&#39;s i mean that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.440" end="00:32:41.200" style="s2">thing you need to get your news from</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.799" end="00:32:42.720" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.200" end="00:32:44.880" style="s2">from a place that will sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.720" end="00:32:47.840" style="s2">surprise you hopefully often</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.880" end="00:32:49.679" style="s2">uh so if if the bbc is is doing that as</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.840" end="00:32:52.080" style="s2">well you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.679" end="00:32:54.000" style="s2">and we were the target audience for npr</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.080" end="00:32:56.880" style="s2">and stopped being any audience for npr</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.000" end="00:32:59.760" style="s2">a long time ago even as as far as we</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.880" end="00:33:02.240" style="s2">understand it our politics did not shift</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.760" end="00:33:04.320" style="s2">so as these publicly funded</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.240" end="00:33:06.480" style="s2">organizations continue to</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.320" end="00:33:07.360" style="s2">uh go farther and farther in either</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.480" end="00:33:08.799" style="s2">direction</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.360" end="00:33:10.880" style="s2">and of course in this case it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.799" end="00:33:11.360" style="s2">towards the left uh something needs to</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.880" end="00:33:13.919" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.360" end="00:33:14.799" style="s2">but defunding them i don&#39;t think is the</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.919" end="00:33:16.880" style="s2">right answer</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.799" end="00:33:17.840" style="s2">um just like defunding the police isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.880" end="00:33:20.640" style="s2">the right answer</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.840" end="00:33:22.080" style="s2">well society can exist without its</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.640" end="00:33:25.919" style="s2">public broadcasting</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.080" end="00:33:27.600" style="s2">but um the bbc</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.919" end="00:33:30.159" style="s2">the bbc is a very different entity than</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.600" end="00:33:32.559" style="s2">npr it plays a much larger role</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.159" end="00:33:34.320" style="s2">and it functions better or at least has</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.559" end="00:33:36.240" style="s2">historically in recent times</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.320" end="00:33:37.919" style="s2">well at the very least it&#39;s both it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.240" end="00:33:39.120" style="s2">both npr and pbs together and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.919" end="00:33:42.240" style="s2">bigger than that still</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.120" end="00:33:44.559" style="s2">but i would say uh don&#39;t get rid of it</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.240" end="00:33:45.919" style="s2">fix it fix it figure out what the rules</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.559" end="00:33:48.000" style="s2">are that govern</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.919" end="00:33:50.080" style="s2">what needs to be covered there you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.000" end="00:33:51.919" style="s2">have it you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.080" end="00:33:53.840" style="s2">here&#39;s the difficult problem which i</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.919" end="00:33:56.799" style="s2">think unfortunately we have to admit</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.840" end="00:33:58.559" style="s2">which is your public broadcasting has an</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.799" end="00:34:00.799" style="s2">obligation to entertain</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.559" end="00:34:02.960" style="s2">mainstream perspectives except in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.799" end="00:34:06.159" style="s2">rare case that mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.960" end="00:34:08.079" style="s2">becomes uh morally repugnant</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.159" end="00:34:10.159" style="s2">right and so what we do in the u.s is we</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.079" end="00:34:12.560" style="s2">pretend that the mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.159" end="00:34:13.679" style="s2">uh has become morally repugnant in order</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.560" end="00:34:16.240" style="s2">not to cover it</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.679" end="00:34:17.919" style="s2">and that&#39;s false you know were you to</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.240" end="00:34:21.119" style="s2">slide into</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.919" end="00:34:22.879" style="s2">uh communism or uh fascism</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.119" end="00:34:25.440" style="s2">then maybe your public broadcasting</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.879" end="00:34:28.159" style="s2">would have to play the role of</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.440" end="00:34:30.159" style="s2">uh of resistance but under normal</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.159" end="00:34:33.280" style="s2">circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.159" end="00:34:35.200" style="s2">mainstream views ought to be compatible</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.280" end="00:34:36.639" style="s2">with your public broadcasting and your</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.200" end="00:34:38.079" style="s2">public broadcasting ought to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.639" end="00:34:40.800" style="s2">explore</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.079" end="00:34:41.679" style="s2">um what is at the edge in order to</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.800" end="00:34:43.440" style="s2">figure out</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.679" end="00:34:45.440" style="s2">what&#39;s coming which does you know there</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.440" end="00:34:47.839" style="s2">are things you can&#39;t do but</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.440" end="00:34:49.679" style="s2">what it can&#39;t do is be an agent of part</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.839" end="00:34:51.359" style="s2">of your population against another part</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.679" end="00:34:54.399" style="s2">of your population unless</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.359" end="00:34:56.000" style="s2">there is a real hazard like</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.399" end="00:34:57.839" style="s2">part of your population is advocating</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.000" end="00:34:59.359" style="s2">genocide or something</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.839" end="00:35:01.359" style="s2">well of course i mean you have exactly</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.359" end="00:35:05.760" style="s2">described what the arguments</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.359" end="00:35:07.760" style="s2">are on the far left uh for why</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.760" end="00:35:10.480" style="s2">what we understand to be actually what</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.760" end="00:35:11.599" style="s2">is believed by what was it 87 percent 86</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.480" end="00:35:16.320" style="s2">percent</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.599" end="00:35:17.920" style="s2">um are not acceptable um because since</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.320" end="00:35:20.240" style="s2">since trump was running and certainly</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.920" end="00:35:22.160" style="s2">since he was elected the claim by</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.240" end="00:35:24.480" style="s2">many on the left has been this is</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.160" end="00:35:25.359" style="s2">fascism this is an authoritarian</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.480" end="00:35:27.119" style="s2">takeover</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.359" end="00:35:28.400" style="s2">and so you know the question you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.119" end="00:35:30.880" style="s2">just to steal man</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.400" end="00:35:32.320" style="s2">their point how would you know when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.880" end="00:35:33.440" style="s2">happening i don&#39;t think it&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.320" end="00:35:34.800" style="s2">no evidence this happened but how would</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.440" end="00:35:36.000" style="s2">you let&#39;s put it this way in this case</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.800" end="00:35:39.200" style="s2">we know it was garbage</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.000" end="00:35:39.680" style="s2">okay you and i have dealt with plenty of</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.200" end="00:35:41.839" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.680" end="00:35:43.280" style="s2">who are trump supporters are decent are</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.839" end="00:35:45.599" style="s2">not racist</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.280" end="00:35:46.960" style="s2">and so the claim was always garbage</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.599" end="00:35:48.800" style="s2">what&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.960" end="00:35:50.720" style="s2">those who thought that this was the</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.800" end="00:35:52.400" style="s2">beginning of a nazi regime</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.720" end="00:35:53.760" style="s2">have an obligation to own up to the fact</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.400" end="00:35:55.920" style="s2">that they were wrong</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.760" end="00:35:58.160" style="s2">right they just simply do so whatever</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.920" end="00:35:59.440" style="s2">process it was that led people it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.160" end="00:36:00.640" style="s2">exactly those people though who are</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.440" end="00:36:02.480" style="s2">pointing to</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.640" end="00:36:04.560" style="s2">uh what we&#39;re seeing on the streets of</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.480" end="00:36:06.079" style="s2">portland among other places and saying</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.560" end="00:36:07.920" style="s2">there it is there&#39;s your authoritarian</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.079" end="00:36:10.480" style="s2">police state coming coming home</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.920" end="00:36:11.040" style="s2">yeah but this makes me so angry okay</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.480" end="00:36:12.960" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.040" end="00:36:14.320" style="s2">the point is why are they attacking</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.960" end="00:36:15.680" style="s2">federal buildings because they want a</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.320" end="00:36:17.359" style="s2">federal crackdown why do they want a</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.680" end="00:36:18.960" style="s2">federal crackdown so that they can claim</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.359" end="00:36:20.800" style="s2">that this is the fascists finally</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.960" end="00:36:22.800" style="s2">arising just as they predicted they are</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.800" end="00:36:24.720" style="s2">creating a self-fulfilling prophecy and</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.800" end="00:36:26.400" style="s2">they are going to claim that it is that</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.720" end="00:36:28.079" style="s2">no matter what it is but you and i live</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.400" end="00:36:31.119" style="s2">in portland we have children here</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.079" end="00:36:33.040" style="s2">okay we need police to protect us we</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.119" end="00:36:36.400" style="s2">need them to enforce the law</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.040" end="00:36:37.440" style="s2">and this uh theater that is going on in</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.400" end="00:36:39.520" style="s2">our streets</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.440" end="00:36:40.880" style="s2">to pretend that everything is hunky-dory</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.520" end="00:36:42.320" style="s2">except for the fact that the feds are</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.880" end="00:36:44.720" style="s2">fascist and here they are</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.320" end="00:36:46.560" style="s2">it&#39;s nonsense and i don&#39;t care that</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.720" end="00:36:48.320" style="s2">they&#39;re going to claim it the answer is</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.560" end="00:36:49.839" style="s2">they&#39;re wrong are there things about the</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.320" end="00:36:52.160" style="s2">way the feds are going about this</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.839" end="00:36:53.280" style="s2">that are troubling there are but you</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.160" end="00:36:56.560" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.280" end="00:36:58.000" style="s2">unless you have an idea of what should</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.560" end="00:37:00.320" style="s2">happen to enforce the law</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.000" end="00:37:01.599" style="s2">if your point is basically these people</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.320" end="00:37:03.040" style="s2">are on the left therefore they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.599" end="00:37:04.480" style="s2">entitled to do whatever they want in</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.040" end="00:37:05.760" style="s2">downtown portland if that&#39;s your point</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.480" end="00:37:07.359" style="s2">i&#39;m not listening to you because you</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.760" end="00:37:08.320" style="s2">obviously don&#39;t know anything about how</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.359" end="00:37:11.760" style="s2">things work</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.320" end="00:37:13.280" style="s2">well but to this point i&#39;m reminded of</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.760" end="00:37:14.560" style="s2">something that you and matt taibbi said</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.280" end="00:37:15.119" style="s2">in the early part of your conversation</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.560" end="00:37:16.720" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.119" end="00:37:18.240" style="s2">if you haven&#39;t listened to it you should</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.720" end="00:37:21.680" style="s2">everyone watching here</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.240" end="00:37:23.280" style="s2">um which is you know his his one of his</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.680" end="00:37:26.400" style="s2">points of expertise being</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.280" end="00:37:29.520" style="s2">being russia he said if i</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.400" end="00:37:31.680" style="s2">if i remember correctly um that</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.520" end="00:37:34.320" style="s2">what he&#39;s seeing here now here in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.680" end="00:37:35.280" style="s2">u.s now reminds him of the bolsheviks in</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.320" end="00:37:37.200" style="s2">part because</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.280" end="00:37:39.680" style="s2">the bolsheviks were always fringe even</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.200" end="00:37:41.520" style="s2">within the revolutionaries</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.680" end="00:37:43.200" style="s2">at the universities and no one took them</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.520" end="00:37:44.960" style="s2">seriously and that was part of how they</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.200" end="00:37:49.119" style="s2">got where they were going</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.960" end="00:37:51.599" style="s2">and because their tactics were</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.119" end="00:37:53.200" style="s2">were effective and sort of no one saw</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.599" end="00:37:54.320" style="s2">them coming so they were easy to dismiss</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.200" end="00:37:54.960" style="s2">by the people who could have stopped</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.320" end="00:37:57.280" style="s2">them early</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.960" end="00:37:59.359" style="s2">and you know you responded by saying</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.280" end="00:38:00.560" style="s2">okay but this looks a lot more maoist</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.359" end="00:38:01.839" style="s2">than bolshevist and</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.560" end="00:38:03.359" style="s2">then bolshevik and a lot in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.839" end="00:38:04.480" style="s2">regards and you know you and i have</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.359" end="00:38:05.599" style="s2">talked about this a lot i think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.480" end="00:38:07.119" style="s2">right but</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.599" end="00:38:09.200" style="s2">that point is one that i hadn&#39;t heard</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.119" end="00:38:10.160" style="s2">before this this i think is is very</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.200" end="00:38:13.599" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.160" end="00:38:16.800" style="s2">that um the claim by the</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.599" end="00:38:18.560" style="s2">leftists uh by the by the anarchist by</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.800" end="00:38:21.200" style="s2">the antifa</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.560" end="00:38:23.200" style="s2">is that we are seeing an authoritarian</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.200" end="00:38:24.960" style="s2">police state that is fascist coming down</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.200" end="00:38:26.560" style="s2">to get us and therefore they are helping</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.960" end="00:38:27.839" style="s2">all the rest of us see what we cannot</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.560" end="00:38:30.560" style="s2">yet see</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.839" end="00:38:32.000" style="s2">and almost all the rest of us are saying</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.560" end="00:38:33.680" style="s2">could you please stop</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.000" end="00:38:35.119" style="s2">you know many of us don&#39;t like him any</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.680" end="00:38:38.960" style="s2">more than you do and some of us</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.119" end="00:38:41.920" style="s2">do but that&#39;s not what this is and</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.960" end="00:38:43.839" style="s2">meanwhile we assume until right now</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.920" end="00:38:45.440" style="s2">basically that it&#39;s going to stop</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.839" end="00:38:46.720" style="s2">and so those of us who were on campuses</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.440" end="00:38:47.760" style="s2">were saying ah it&#39;s not gonna stop it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.720" end="00:38:50.560" style="s2">gonna leave campus</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.760" end="00:38:51.920" style="s2">and now it&#39;s on the streets and you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.560" end="00:38:55.119" style="s2">to the person who wrote</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.920" end="00:38:55.760" style="s2">on twitter about uh not seeing anything</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.119" end="00:38:57.680" style="s2">like this</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.760" end="00:38:59.040" style="s2">in their you know presumably beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.680" end="00:39:02.000" style="s2">and somewhat idyllic</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.040" end="00:39:03.040" style="s2">virginia town it won&#39;t look like this</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.000" end="00:39:05.040" style="s2">when it comes there</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.040" end="00:39:07.040" style="s2">but it&#39;s going to creep into the schools</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.040" end="00:39:09.200" style="s2">it probably already is in the schools</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.040" end="00:39:10.240" style="s2">and in the courts and where do you get</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.200" end="00:39:11.760" style="s2">your media and</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.240" end="00:39:13.200" style="s2">and all of that so that we end up more</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.760" end="00:39:14.320" style="s2">and more and more polarized and</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.200" end="00:39:16.800" style="s2">meanwhile</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.320" end="00:39:17.760" style="s2">um meanwhile the equivalent of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.800" end="00:39:21.200" style="s2">bolsheviks</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.760" end="00:39:23.119" style="s2">gain power yes and i think at some level</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.200" end="00:39:24.560" style="s2">you also have to</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.119" end="00:39:27.440" style="s2">put the things that are being said</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.560" end="00:39:30.960" style="s2">together you know if somebody is saying</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.440" end="00:39:32.240" style="s2">um yes men can get pregnant too and</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.960" end="00:39:34.320" style="s2">that&#39;s a fascist</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.240" end="00:39:35.280" style="s2">crackdown then the point is you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.320" end="00:39:38.000" style="s2">what i think</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.280" end="00:39:39.359" style="s2">your judgment on what something is might</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.000" end="00:39:42.400" style="s2">be a little off</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.359" end="00:39:45.440" style="s2">right it&#39;s just not credible</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.400" end="00:39:46.640" style="s2">yeah no that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s right and</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.440" end="00:39:48.640" style="s2">that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.640" end="00:39:51.200" style="s2">i mean i keep coming back to this and i</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.640" end="00:39:53.680" style="s2">and i hate that i have to because</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.200" end="00:39:55.119" style="s2">we we have trans friends and we had</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.680" end="00:39:56.000" style="s2">trans students and why do we always have</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.119" end="00:39:59.920" style="s2">to start by saying</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.000" end="00:40:02.240" style="s2">that um but even some people we know</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.920" end="00:40:04.480" style="s2">have now just a couple have approached</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.240" end="00:40:05.760" style="s2">us and said you know can&#39;t you be kind</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.480" end="00:40:07.200" style="s2">can&#39;t you just accept that if someone</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.760" end="00:40:08.319" style="s2">says they&#39;re the sex that they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.200" end="00:40:09.920" style="s2">born to that they are</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.319" end="00:40:11.680" style="s2">and that it&#39;s fine and that it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.920" end="00:40:14.560" style="s2">gonna be okay like</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.680" end="00:40:17.200" style="s2">no this is actually an indicator this</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.560" end="00:40:19.760" style="s2">this is that canary stopping its song</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.200" end="00:40:21.119" style="s2">in the coal mine this this thing when</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.760" end="00:40:22.640" style="s2">people start saying</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.119" end="00:40:24.160" style="s2">if with a straight face you can&#39;t tell</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.640" end="00:40:28.000" style="s2">me that men can get pregnant</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.160" end="00:40:30.800" style="s2">and menstruate and have uterine cancer</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.000" end="00:40:31.920" style="s2">uh then you&#39;re a fascist um no there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.800" end="00:40:34.160" style="s2">something wrong with you</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.920" end="00:40:35.440" style="s2">yeah me and not me it doesn&#39;t come down</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.160" end="00:40:37.839" style="s2">to the trans thing either</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.440" end="00:40:39.440" style="s2">right every single claim here is</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.839" end="00:40:41.839" style="s2">nonsense right</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.440" end="00:40:42.960" style="s2">oh why people are racist black people</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.839" end="00:40:45.040" style="s2">can&#39;t be racist</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.960" end="00:40:46.240" style="s2">all men are sexist all men all men are</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.040" end="00:40:49.040" style="s2">rapists</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.240" end="00:40:50.000" style="s2">that uh if we eliminate the police it</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.040" end="00:40:53.280" style="s2">will be</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.000" end="00:40:54.560" style="s2">like a well-heeled white suburb</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.280" end="00:40:56.720" style="s2">that&#39;s what it looks like when you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.560" end="00:41:00.000" style="s2">have i think</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.720" end="00:41:02.720" style="s2">i think aoc said that one if i&#39;m not uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.000" end="00:41:04.000" style="s2">mistaken about the video i saw but in</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.720" end="00:41:05.599" style="s2">any case the point is look</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.000" end="00:41:07.680" style="s2">when somebody keeps saying things that</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.599" end="00:41:09.280" style="s2">are patently stupid and then they say</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.680" end="00:41:10.319" style="s2">something that you maybe have trouble</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.280" end="00:41:11.280" style="s2">evaluating because you&#39;re not in</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.319" end="00:41:13.040" style="s2">portland</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.280" end="00:41:14.640" style="s2">right then the answer is actually</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.040" end="00:41:17.440" style="s2">they&#39;ve established that they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.640" end="00:41:19.040" style="s2">good at describing things in real terms</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.440" end="00:41:19.440" style="s2">i don&#39;t have to listen to them when they</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.040" end="00:41:20.640" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.440" end="00:41:23.280" style="s2">that the fact of the feds are in</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.640" end="00:41:25.920" style="s2">portland is an indication that uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.280" end="00:41:26.720" style="s2">trump was hitler now this this is good</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.920" end="00:41:27.920" style="s2">tell me</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.720" end="00:41:30.319" style="s2">four of the other things that you</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.920" end="00:41:32.640" style="s2">believe to be true and and let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.319" end="00:41:34.079" style="s2">what kind of reality tests they pass and</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.640" end="00:41:35.920" style="s2">then you know if they do</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.079" end="00:41:38.079" style="s2">then i&#39;ll listen to you try to back up</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.920" end="00:41:40.079" style="s2">your claim that we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.079" end="00:41:41.760" style="s2">undergoing a fascist authoritarian</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.079" end="00:41:42.960" style="s2">regime change that needs to be pushed</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.760" end="00:41:46.319" style="s2">back against with</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.960" end="00:41:48.000" style="s2">violence in the streets 40 minutes okay</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.319" end="00:41:51.920" style="s2">we&#39;ll do one more here and</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.000" end="00:41:54.560" style="s2">uh uh two more here actually and then</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.920" end="00:41:57.040" style="s2">we&#39;ll switch the other</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.560" end="00:41:58.480" style="s2">q and i the other super chat covet 19</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.040" end="00:42:00.000" style="s2">what can we infer about the virus by</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.480" end="00:42:02.640" style="s2">virtue of being a coronavirus</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.000" end="00:42:04.079" style="s2">hiv is largely asymptomatic at first is</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.640" end="00:42:06.640" style="s2">asymptomatic a concern</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.079" end="00:42:07.760" style="s2">so i did want to get to this one because</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.640" end="00:42:09.440" style="s2">uh we talked</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.760" end="00:42:11.119" style="s2">we talked a tremendous amount about</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.440" end="00:42:13.280" style="s2">cyrus cove 2 in</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.119" end="00:42:15.440" style="s2">you know episodes one through 16 and 18</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.280" end="00:42:18.400" style="s2">basically</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.440" end="00:42:19.760" style="s2">and uh i think specifically talked about</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.400" end="00:42:21.359" style="s2">it being occurring a virus and what the</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.760" end="00:42:25.440" style="s2">implications of that were</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.359" end="00:42:29.119" style="s2">and what what we can do uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.440" end="00:42:31.280" style="s2">wait no yeah um what the implications of</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.119" end="00:42:35.040" style="s2">that were in like episodes two and three</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.280" end="00:42:37.200" style="s2">um so those</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.040" end="00:42:38.319" style="s2">those uh conclusions that we came to i</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.200" end="00:42:40.079" style="s2">don&#39;t think have changed</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.319" end="00:42:41.280" style="s2">um the sort of the broad level</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.079" end="00:42:43.040" style="s2">understanding of what it being</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.280" end="00:42:44.000" style="s2">coronavirus means about the likelihood</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.040" end="00:42:47.280" style="s2">of us</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.000" end="00:42:48.319" style="s2">generating for instance a vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.280" end="00:42:50.560" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be hard but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.319" end="00:42:53.119" style="s2">impossible um</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.560" end="00:42:54.640" style="s2">asymptomatic carriers seems likely and</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.119" end="00:42:56.000" style="s2">that is also consistent with what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.640" end="00:42:58.240" style="s2">seeing now well maybe not</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.000" end="00:42:59.920" style="s2">asymptomatic long term in other words oh</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.240" end="00:43:00.480" style="s2">yeah you have an asymptomatic case but</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.920" end="00:43:02.400" style="s2">the thing with</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.480" end="00:43:04.079" style="s2">hiv is there&#39;s a very yeah not nearly as</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.400" end="00:43:05.040" style="s2">long term as hiv yeah there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.079" end="00:43:07.680" style="s2">a very</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.040" end="00:43:08.240" style="s2">comprehensible reason why you have that</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.680" end="00:43:11.599" style="s2">period</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.240" end="00:43:13.839" style="s2">of asymptomatic uh hiv infection which</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.599" end="00:43:17.599" style="s2">has to do with the attack</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.839" end="00:43:19.839" style="s2">on the immune cells themselves so</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.599" end="00:43:22.800" style="s2">hiv pulls a trick on the immune system</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.839" end="00:43:25.119" style="s2">where it attacks activated</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.800" end="00:43:26.480" style="s2">t cells and by attacking activated t</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.119" end="00:43:27.280" style="s2">cells it basically digs a hole in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.480" end="00:43:28.560" style="s2">immune system</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.280" end="00:43:30.480" style="s2">and then there&#39;s a kind of arms race</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.560" end="00:43:32.640" style="s2">that can unfold over the course of</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.480" end="00:43:33.520" style="s2">a decade when the arms race is lost by</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.640" end="00:43:37.359" style="s2">the immune system</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.520" end="00:43:40.880" style="s2">suddenly full-blown aids emerges</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.359" end="00:43:42.880" style="s2">the coronavirus isn&#39;t functioning this</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.880" end="00:43:45.040" style="s2">way at all now i do think that there are</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.880" end="00:43:46.319" style="s2">some concerns we have to have about its</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.040" end="00:43:49.520" style="s2">nature which may</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.319" end="00:43:51.040" style="s2">owe to the fact or to the likely fact</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.520" end="00:43:53.599" style="s2">that it emerged from a laboratory and</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.040" end="00:43:56.800" style="s2">passaging experiment experiments</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.599" end="00:43:57.280" style="s2">that gained function for it which would</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.800" end="00:44:00.640" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.280" end="00:44:02.880" style="s2">its high diversity of symptoms</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.640" end="00:44:04.160" style="s2">and its high transmissibility may have</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.880" end="00:44:06.000" style="s2">been the consequence of those</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.160" end="00:44:09.359" style="s2">experiments designed to create</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.000" end="00:44:11.599" style="s2">an ideal study organism um but i</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.359" end="00:44:13.280" style="s2">i think the parallel to hiv is limited</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.599" end="00:44:15.280" style="s2">there&#39;s some parallel but it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.280" end="00:44:17.680" style="s2">strong one</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.280" end="00:44:19.599" style="s2">okay one more here and then we&#39;ll switch</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.680" end="00:44:20.560" style="s2">over this is just an observation i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.599" end="00:44:23.280" style="s2">know if it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.560" end="00:44:25.119" style="s2">but i&#39;ll read it another educator in</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.280" end="00:44:26.240" style="s2">michigan was fired for tweeting quote</p>

<p begin="00:44:26.240" end="00:44:32.000" style="s2">how are uh uh i think that all they did</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.839" end="00:44:34.160" style="s2">was tweet trump trump is our president</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.000" end="00:44:35.920" style="s2">the question continues how are schools</p>

<p begin="00:44:50.000" end="00:44:54.640" style="s2">whether or not you could</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.440" end="00:44:56.960" style="s2">say trump was president in a free speech</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.640" end="00:44:57.680" style="s2">zone and i mean it is it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.960" end="00:44:59.920" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.680" end="00:45:01.599" style="s2">right the fact is this is just simply a</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.920" end="00:45:02.960" style="s2">factual matter you may not like that</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.599" end="00:45:03.359" style="s2">trump as president i don&#39;t like that</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.960" end="00:45:06.640" style="s2">he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.359" end="00:45:08.079" style="s2">president but he is president so</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.640" end="00:45:09.839" style="s2">now when some of the this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.079" end="00:45:11.280" style="s2">that same it&#39;s read-only activism again</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.839" end="00:45:12.800" style="s2">because i&#39;m reminded you saying that</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.280" end="00:45:14.720" style="s2">reminds me very much of</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.800" end="00:45:16.400" style="s2">when i made the outlandish claim that</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.720" end="00:45:18.160" style="s2">men are on average taller than women</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.400" end="00:45:20.319" style="s2">in that auditorium in portland with</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.160" end="00:45:21.119" style="s2">james damore and a bunch of activists</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.319" end="00:45:23.280" style="s2">turned out and</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.119" end="00:45:24.160" style="s2">took the sound equipment out with him</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.280" end="00:45:27.119" style="s2">yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.160" end="00:45:28.000" style="s2">but as it turns out as as ludicrous and</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.119" end="00:45:29.680" style="s2">frankly</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.000" end="00:45:31.040" style="s2">bad for their cause as their timing</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.680" end="00:45:32.240" style="s2">turned out to have been they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.040" end="00:45:34.079" style="s2">responding to me</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.240" end="00:45:35.680" style="s2">they just timed it because they knew in</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.079" end="00:45:36.800" style="s2">advance of anyone ever opening their</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.680" end="00:45:38.319" style="s2">mouths in that room</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.800" end="00:45:40.160" style="s2">that things were going to be said that</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.319" end="00:45:41.680" style="s2">were going to be unacceptable to them</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.160" end="00:45:43.440" style="s2">and their fragile years</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.680" end="00:45:44.960" style="s2">and that&#39;s the same thing with the claim</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.440" end="00:45:46.480" style="s2">that trump is president no</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.960" end="00:45:48.240" style="s2">i don&#39;t want it to be the case therefore</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.480" end="00:45:50.319" style="s2">it can&#39;t be therefore if you say it</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.240" end="00:45:52.000" style="s2">you are somehow part of the problem this</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.319" end="00:45:52.319" style="s2">is once again it&#39;s childish these people</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.000" end="00:45:54.400" style="s2">need</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.319" end="00:45:56.319" style="s2">good parents and they need them fast</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.400" end="00:46:00.160" style="s2">well but if we can steal man their point</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.319" end="00:46:02.560" style="s2">oh good if you if you say uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.160" end="00:46:04.000" style="s2">on average men are taller than women how</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.560" end="00:46:06.660" style="s2">do we know that&#39;s not your</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.000" end="00:46:09.680" style="s2">internalized diminutive stature</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.660" end="00:46:11.520" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.680" end="00:46:13.680" style="s2">so i&#39;ve never stood up here you have no</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.520" end="00:46:15.040" style="s2">idea you have no idea</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.680" end="00:46:17.119" style="s2">yeah right i might be shorter than the</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.040" end="00:46:17.920" style="s2">dog you it&#39;s possible yeah i might be</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.119" end="00:46:21.280" style="s2">standing up</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.920" end="00:46:23.119" style="s2">right now all right that was not the</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.280" end="00:46:25.040" style="s2">best job of steel manning i&#39;ve ever done</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.119" end="00:46:26.319" style="s2">but uh no you&#39;re usually better than</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.040" end="00:46:28.079" style="s2">that but then you&#39;re usually trying</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.319" end="00:46:31.200" style="s2">harder yeah that&#39;s also true</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.079" end="00:46:34.000" style="s2">yeah okay um</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.200" end="00:46:35.520" style="s2">in the order in which they came in some</p>

<p begin="00:46:49.359" end="00:46:54.960" style="s2">that is that is beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.960" end="00:46:56.000" style="s2">um in most places where humans have done</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.960" end="00:47:00.240" style="s2">well there are</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.000" end="00:47:01.839" style="s2">songbirds and yes we would have begun to</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.240" end="00:47:04.079" style="s2">listen to them so you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.839" end="00:47:05.280" style="s2">effectively part the hypothesis here is</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.079" end="00:47:06.560" style="s2">that we&#39;re part of their mixed foraging</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.280" end="00:47:09.200" style="s2">flocks</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.560" end="00:47:12.160" style="s2">and that even though we aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.200" end="00:47:14.480" style="s2">contributing anything obvious to them</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.160" end="00:47:16.400" style="s2">maybe we are listening for their song</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.480" end="00:47:17.119" style="s2">just as they are watching for our signs</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.400" end="00:47:19.599" style="s2">of alarm</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.119" end="00:47:20.559" style="s2">and we will um all be alarmed together</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.599" end="00:47:24.720" style="s2">if something</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.559" end="00:47:26.640" style="s2">happens yep i like it and uh by inducing</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.720" end="00:47:28.400" style="s2">you to pay attention to bird&#39;s song</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.640" end="00:47:29.920" style="s2">it could cause you to know when bird&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.400" end="00:47:30.240" style="s2">song has changed and you know you can</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.920" end="00:47:31.760" style="s2">hear</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.240" end="00:47:33.520" style="s2">lots of things squirrels for example</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.760" end="00:47:35.760" style="s2">will alert you to something</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.520" end="00:47:37.280" style="s2">you know that they regard as hazardous</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.760" end="00:47:38.720" style="s2">yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.280" end="00:47:41.520" style="s2">usually not the same thing as a person</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.720" end="00:47:43.359" style="s2">regards as hazardous no</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.520" end="00:47:46.240" style="s2">a lower bar for i do remember i&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.359" end="00:47:48.960" style="s2">to remember which student it was</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.240" end="00:47:49.839" style="s2">i had a student write a paper on the</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.960" end="00:47:54.079" style="s2">concept</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.839" end="00:47:57.520" style="s2">of um whether there&#39;s this pattern of</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.079" end="00:47:58.960" style="s2">people uh hunter-gatherers keeping pets</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.520" end="00:48:01.040" style="s2">right taking forest creatures and</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.960" end="00:48:02.720" style="s2">hand-raising them and the question was</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.040" end="00:48:05.040" style="s2">whether this was providing them</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.720" end="00:48:06.000" style="s2">basically access to the sensory systems</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.040" end="00:48:08.480" style="s2">of these creatures that</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.000" end="00:48:10.079" style="s2">by developing an empathic bond that that</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.480" end="00:48:11.520" style="s2">creature then provides them</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.079" end="00:48:13.839" style="s2">an ability to see into the world the way</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.520" end="00:48:15.680" style="s2">you know dogs provide us the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.839" end="00:48:17.599" style="s2">detect scents that we can&#39;t ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.680" end="00:48:19.839" style="s2">smell</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.599" end="00:48:21.839" style="s2">so anyway yeah there&#39;s something to it</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.839" end="00:48:22.559" style="s2">also it might explain some of the really</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.839" end="00:48:24.079" style="s2">weird</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.559" end="00:48:25.839" style="s2">behavior that every so often somebody</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.079" end="00:48:28.880" style="s2">will post a clip of</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.839" end="00:48:33.200" style="s2">i saw one just a couple days ago</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.880" end="00:48:35.680" style="s2">uh it was a magpie was ushering</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.200" end="00:48:37.119" style="s2">might have been a hedgehog across a road</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.680" end="00:48:38.800" style="s2">and it was clear that this is what the</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.119" end="00:48:40.559" style="s2">animal was doing that the</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.800" end="00:48:42.880" style="s2">magpie was coming up behind the hedgehog</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.559" end="00:48:44.960" style="s2">and urging it across the road</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.880" end="00:48:46.800" style="s2">right and you know well the</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.960" end="00:48:50.160" style="s2">interpretation is up for grabs but</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.800" end="00:48:52.880" style="s2">yeah um magpies are i think corvids</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.160" end="00:48:54.960" style="s2">and so corvids being crows and jays uh</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.880" end="00:48:57.359" style="s2">and a few others and ravens</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.960" end="00:48:59.280" style="s2">uh you know super smart you know just</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.359" end="00:49:01.920" style="s2">more theory of mind than</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.280" end="00:49:03.839" style="s2">you know other corvids and parrots and</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.920" end="00:49:05.040" style="s2">then a smattering of mammal clades have</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.839" end="00:49:08.240" style="s2">theory of mind</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.040" end="00:49:10.319" style="s2">um and they seem to be able to empathize</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.240" end="00:49:11.599" style="s2">outside of clade apparently helping</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.319" end="00:49:12.720" style="s2">helping a hedgehog well</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.599" end="00:49:14.880" style="s2">it&#39;s also impossible that we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:49:14.880" end="00:49:19.040" style="s2">yeah but uh you will be the guest of</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.119" end="00:49:21.920" style="s2">honor but you know there are</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.040" end="00:49:23.520" style="s2">examples of partnerships between</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.920" end="00:49:25.440" style="s2">creatures you know honey guides and</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.520" end="00:49:27.440" style="s2">people are a good example</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.440" end="00:49:29.119" style="s2">there are natural examples of this where</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.440" end="00:49:30.640" style="s2">uh there&#39;s a partnering and</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.119" end="00:49:32.240" style="s2">in fact mixed foraging flocks if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.640" end="00:49:32.960" style="s2">foraging on different things you can</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.240" end="00:49:35.839" style="s2">afford to</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.960" end="00:49:36.720" style="s2">have effectively a school of birds as it</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.839" end="00:49:38.800" style="s2">were</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.720" end="00:49:40.640" style="s2">that&#39;s larger than it would be if they</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.800" end="00:49:41.839" style="s2">were all your type and competing for the</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.640" end="00:49:44.400" style="s2">same food resource</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.839" end="00:49:45.599" style="s2">or even i mean um you know i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.400" end="00:49:48.640" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.599" end="00:49:50.079" style="s2">boy like chickadees and kinglets in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.640" end="00:49:50.559" style="s2">pacific northwest that engage in these</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.079" end="00:49:52.240" style="s2">winter</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.559" end="00:49:54.000" style="s2">mixed foraging flocks in which i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.240" end="00:49:55.760" style="s2">remember which it is but one of them</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.000" end="00:49:57.520" style="s2">they feed on very much the same winter</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.760" end="00:49:59.200" style="s2">berries actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.520" end="00:50:01.119" style="s2">but they&#39;re very partially distributed</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.200" end="00:50:02.559" style="s2">and one of the species is much better at</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.119" end="00:50:03.200" style="s2">finding and the other species is much</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.559" end="00:50:04.559" style="s2">better at</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.200" end="00:50:06.880" style="s2">having centuries and watching it for</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.559" end="00:50:08.559" style="s2">predators and so they actually are</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.880" end="00:50:10.240" style="s2">competing for the same resource but</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.559" end="00:50:11.760" style="s2">together they&#39;re both specialists</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.240" end="00:50:13.839" style="s2">positive something that each of them</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.760" end="00:50:16.960" style="s2">need yeah yeah wow that&#39;s cool</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.839" end="00:50:19.839" style="s2">yeah any plans for a discussion with a</p>

<p begin="00:51:13.200" end="00:51:17.200" style="s2">yeah but in terms of the number of</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.960" end="00:51:20.319" style="s2">people i believe it&#39;s a small</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.200" end="00:51:21.920" style="s2">outfit yeah but yeah very few and far</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.319" end="00:51:23.200" style="s2">between these examples and we&#39;ll see how</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.920" end="00:51:25.040" style="s2">they do over the long term</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.200" end="00:51:26.880" style="s2">yeah i mean i think everyone is is</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.040" end="00:51:29.839" style="s2">feeling pressured to</p>

<p begin="00:51:33.440" end="00:51:36.160" style="s2">storefronts then</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.559" end="00:51:37.680" style="s2">you know put out a letter that explains</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.160" end="00:51:38.880" style="s2">how they&#39;ve been failing and they</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.680" end="00:51:41.040" style="s2">promise to do better</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.880" end="00:51:43.040" style="s2">and most of those are just empty words</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.040" end="00:51:45.760" style="s2">uh and they&#39;re hoping this passes</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.040" end="00:51:46.480" style="s2">and uh really what we need are more</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.760" end="00:51:47.680" style="s2">people doing</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.480" end="00:51:49.920" style="s2">doing this i don&#39;t i don&#39;t know the red</p>

<p begin="00:51:50.800" end="00:51:54.640" style="s2">just selfishly i wish it were a company</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.040" end="00:51:57.839" style="s2">that i could get behind but</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.640" end="00:52:00.400" style="s2">um yeah more power to them and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.839" end="00:52:02.880" style="s2">they can then be an example for a</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.400" end="00:52:05.599" style="s2">diversity of kinds of companies so that</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.880" end="00:52:06.640" style="s2">within each of the sectors we can begin</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.599" end="00:52:09.599" style="s2">to see</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.640" end="00:52:09.599" style="s2">some of this stopping</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.880" end="00:52:14.960" style="s2">do facial musculature and expression on</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.200" end="00:52:16.480" style="s2">both sides of one&#39;s face</p>

<p begin="00:52:18.720" end="00:52:22.400" style="s2">can we derive big five traits from still</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.960" end="00:52:25.040" style="s2">or moving faces</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.400" end="00:52:26.640" style="s2">and are we wired to do it thanks from</p>

<p begin="00:52:26.640" end="00:52:30.000" style="s2">well so here&#39;s the thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.640" end="00:52:33.920" style="s2">interesting there</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.000" end="00:52:36.240" style="s2">is a lot that you do not want to allow</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.920" end="00:52:37.520" style="s2">your adversaries to know about your</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.240" end="00:52:39.839" style="s2">thought process</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.520" end="00:52:41.680" style="s2">right and so were there readily</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.839" end="00:52:43.920" style="s2">detectable patterns</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.680" end="00:52:46.000" style="s2">we would probably learn to detect them</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.920" end="00:52:47.359" style="s2">and so there is a pressure to conceal</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.000" end="00:52:48.960" style="s2">that stuff now there&#39;s certain places</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.359" end="00:52:49.599" style="s2">where we don&#39;t we&#39;re not very effective</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.960" end="00:52:52.000" style="s2">at it like</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.599" end="00:52:53.760" style="s2">blushing right yeah why would you want</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.000" end="00:52:55.200" style="s2">to convey that you&#39;re suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.760" end="00:52:57.200" style="s2">feeling the way one does when one</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.200" end="00:52:58.880" style="s2">blushes well you don&#39;t want to convey it</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.200" end="00:53:01.599" style="s2">but here&#39;s what you also don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.880" end="00:53:02.160" style="s2">you don&#39;t want your brain to overheat</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.599" end="00:53:04.720" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.160" end="00:53:05.680" style="s2">what happens to yourself then no i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.720" end="00:53:07.810" style="s2">think you want your brain to</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.680" end="00:53:09.520" style="s2">okay especially if you&#39;re standing up um</p>

<p begin="00:53:13.119" end="00:53:17.040" style="s2">if you suddenly have to think very hard</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.440" end="00:53:18.559" style="s2">let&#39;s suppose that you&#39;re suddenly very</p>

<p begin="00:53:32.559" end="00:53:35.839" style="s2">generates a lot of heat</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.160" end="00:53:37.760" style="s2">and so how do you get rid of that heat</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.839" end="00:53:39.200" style="s2">you shunt the heat to the capillaries on</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.760" end="00:53:40.559" style="s2">the surface of your skin which causes</p>

<p begin="00:53:47.440" end="00:53:50.480" style="s2">no it&#39;s terrible for them to realize</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.280" end="00:53:52.079" style="s2">that for one thing if they&#39;ve caught you</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.480" end="00:53:53.599" style="s2">in a lie and you&#39;re suddenly blushing</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.079" end="00:53:56.720" style="s2">and that&#39;s why you&#39;re thinking so hard</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.599" end="00:53:58.720" style="s2">that&#39;s very compromising absolutely um</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.720" end="00:53:59.760" style="s2">but it&#39;s better than the alternative</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.720" end="00:54:01.599" style="s2">which is overheating</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.760" end="00:54:03.359" style="s2">right and there&#39;s some ambiguity too</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.599" end="00:54:04.559" style="s2">nobody knows why you&#39;re thinking so hard</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.359" end="00:54:06.800" style="s2">could be because you&#39;ve been caught in a</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.559" end="00:54:10.000" style="s2">lie it could be for whatever reason</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.800" end="00:54:12.319" style="s2">so um so i mean there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.000" end="00:54:13.760" style="s2">to the first question oh finish up all</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.319" end="00:54:16.800" style="s2">i&#39;m saying is</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.760" end="00:54:18.000" style="s2">uh the idea that we are accidentally</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.800" end="00:54:20.400" style="s2">broadcasting</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.000" end="00:54:21.359" style="s2">stuff through facial musculature</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.400" end="00:54:23.440" style="s2">certainly we are</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.359" end="00:54:25.119" style="s2">broadcasting some stuff it is below the</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.440" end="00:54:26.480" style="s2">threshold that most people can detect it</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.119" end="00:54:28.079" style="s2">you might be able to train yourself to</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.480" end="00:54:29.839" style="s2">detect it to the extent that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.079" end="00:54:31.280" style="s2">detectable it&#39;s a vulnerability so you</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.839" end="00:54:35.200" style="s2">should expect it to be</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.280" end="00:54:37.839" style="s2">backed off to a sub threshold level</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.200" end="00:54:38.880" style="s2">and so like that no i don&#39;t expect that</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.839" end="00:54:41.280" style="s2">you can</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.880" end="00:54:43.440" style="s2">um that there are reliable</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.280" end="00:54:45.119" style="s2">characteristics broadcast in that way</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.440" end="00:54:47.040" style="s2">yeah i don&#39;t expect so either but to the</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.119" end="00:54:48.960" style="s2">first question in particular do facial</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.040" end="00:54:49.680" style="s2">musculature and expression on both sides</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.960" end="00:54:50.880" style="s2">of one&#39;s face</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.680" end="00:54:52.720" style="s2">correlate to how one uses their</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.880" end="00:54:56.079" style="s2">associated brain hemispheres</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.720" end="00:54:58.240" style="s2">this is testable and this it won&#39;t be as</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.079" end="00:55:00.079" style="s2">easy as just going to handedness because</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.240" end="00:55:01.440" style="s2">you don&#39;t have a switch of what tends to</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.079" end="00:55:02.880" style="s2">happen on the left side of the brain</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.440" end="00:55:04.960" style="s2">in right-handers is now happening on the</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.880" end="00:55:07.760" style="s2">right side of the brain and left-handers</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.960" end="00:55:09.839" style="s2">but some fraction of left-handers does</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.760" end="00:55:11.359" style="s2">have a reversal of where the dominant</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.839" end="00:55:12.880" style="s2">stuff happens in which hemisphere</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.359" end="00:55:14.400" style="s2">and a much smaller fraction of</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.880" end="00:55:17.200" style="s2">right-handers do as well</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.400" end="00:55:17.760" style="s2">so you could actually test this by by</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.200" end="00:55:19.280" style="s2">looking</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.760" end="00:55:21.760" style="s2">at whether or not there are different</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.280" end="00:55:24.720" style="s2">flucturing asymmetries for instance</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.760" end="00:55:26.960" style="s2">in those tiny fraction of people whose</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.720" end="00:55:29.440" style="s2">brains are organized and mirror image to</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.960" end="00:55:31.359" style="s2">how the rest of ours are organized</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.440" end="00:55:33.200" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure it&#39;s it wouldn&#39;t be the top</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.359" end="00:55:35.119" style="s2">of my list of things to investigate but</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.200" end="00:55:36.720" style="s2">could i&#39;d be i&#39;d read the paper if it</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.119" end="00:55:39.520" style="s2">was done</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.720" end="00:55:40.799" style="s2">next question do human males and females</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.520" end="00:55:42.400" style="s2">experience the same intensity of</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.799" end="00:55:43.839" style="s2">selection pressure given polygyny and</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.400" end="00:55:44.640" style="s2">gender disparities in the number of</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.839" end="00:55:47.119" style="s2">ancestors</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.640" end="00:55:49.119" style="s2">and average number of offspring produced</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.119" end="00:55:50.640" style="s2">or the sex is becoming more dimorphic as</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.119" end="00:55:54.000" style="s2">generations pass</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.640" end="00:55:56.319" style="s2">this is a lot of question</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.000" end="00:55:56.319" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.280" end="00:56:02.880" style="s2">so we experience very different</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.760" end="00:56:05.280" style="s2">selective pressures</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.880" end="00:56:06.160" style="s2">yeah in other words the asymmetry</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.280" end="00:56:09.520" style="s2">especially</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.160" end="00:56:12.319" style="s2">of pregnancy and obligate early child</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.520" end="00:56:13.760" style="s2">rearing by females causes an asymmetry</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.319" end="00:56:17.200" style="s2">the asymmetry</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.760" end="00:56:19.839" style="s2">is partially substantially neutralized</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.200" end="00:56:23.280" style="s2">by monogamous mating</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.839" end="00:56:26.160" style="s2">so monogamous mating makes the interests</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.280" end="00:56:26.480" style="s2">of men and women more symmetrical though</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.160" end="00:56:29.119" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.480" end="00:56:30.480" style="s2">completely symmetrical so i was reading</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.119" end="00:56:31.680" style="s2">another question what did you say makes</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.480" end="00:56:33.440" style="s2">the interest more symmetrical</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.680" end="00:56:35.119" style="s2">uh monogamous mating which means that</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.440" end="00:56:36.559" style="s2">it&#39;s very high stakes for both parties</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.119" end="00:56:38.079" style="s2">rather than being very high stakes for</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.559" end="00:56:38.640" style="s2">one party and very low stakes for the</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.079" end="00:56:40.960" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.640" end="00:56:42.799" style="s2">which then means well but the monogamy</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.960" end="00:56:43.839" style="s2">um as monogamy becomes more and more</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.799" end="00:56:45.599" style="s2">common</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.839" end="00:56:47.280" style="s2">we expect the sexes to become less</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.599" end="00:56:48.559" style="s2">dimorphic rather than more dimorphic as</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.280" end="00:56:51.839" style="s2">the generations pass</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.559" end="00:56:55.040" style="s2">although our dimorphism is weird so</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.839" end="00:56:58.559" style="s2">um the just the fact that the</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.040" end="00:57:01.520" style="s2">interests of males and females are both</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.559" end="00:57:04.240" style="s2">elevated by monogamous high stakes</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.520" end="00:57:06.400" style="s2">reproduction</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.240" end="00:57:09.760" style="s2">does not mean you know for example you</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.400" end="00:57:13.680" style="s2">know breasts are an indicator of</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.760" end="00:57:16.799" style="s2">basically physical presence of resources</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.680" end="00:57:18.240" style="s2">sufficient to produce offspring now</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.799" end="00:57:20.160" style="s2">you&#39;ll get a lot of pushback on that</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.240" end="00:57:23.599" style="s2">claim but painting with the broad brush</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.160" end="00:57:25.359" style="s2">it is an indicator that indicator is</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.599" end="00:57:26.160" style="s2">obviously a focus of straight male</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.359" end="00:57:29.040" style="s2">attention</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.160" end="00:57:30.960" style="s2">for the obvious reason and you do not</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.040" end="00:57:33.280" style="s2">expect it to become symmetrical</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.960" end="00:57:34.640" style="s2">because a female does not have the same</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.280" end="00:57:36.960" style="s2">interest in a male having</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.640" end="00:57:38.960" style="s2">those resources she may have an interest</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.960" end="00:57:40.880" style="s2">in a male having different resources</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.960" end="00:57:42.640" style="s2">could be cognitive resources could be</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.880" end="00:57:46.559" style="s2">physical strength</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.640" end="00:57:48.640" style="s2">but the point is you expect a dimorphism</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.559" end="00:57:50.160" style="s2">but you don&#39;t expect you expect a yin</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.640" end="00:57:53.760" style="s2">yang situation</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.160" end="00:57:56.880" style="s2">rather than a augmented uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.760" end="00:57:57.359" style="s2">party and a drab party right there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.880" end="00:58:00.480" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.359" end="00:58:01.599" style="s2">a a common error in the question i think</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.480" end="00:58:04.720" style="s2">needs to be addressed</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.599" end="00:58:06.319" style="s2">uh which is that uh well it&#39;s assuming</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.720" end="00:58:07.760" style="s2">polygeny which is not an error we</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.319" end="00:58:09.920" style="s2">certainly have a lot of pollution in our</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.760" end="00:58:11.359" style="s2">in our past and still in our present</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.920" end="00:58:13.359" style="s2">although we seem to be moving towards</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.359" end="00:58:15.359" style="s2">towards greater monogamy um but</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.359" end="00:58:16.400" style="s2">even with under conditions of extreme</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.359" end="00:58:18.960" style="s2">polygony</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.400" end="00:58:21.920" style="s2">we there are no gender i would say sex</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.960" end="00:58:24.960" style="s2">disparities in the number of ancestors</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.920" end="00:58:27.520" style="s2">so this is a this is a conflation of</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.960" end="00:58:28.880" style="s2">two things um which is which is why the</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.520" end="00:58:30.160" style="s2">error is made and i think it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.880" end="00:58:32.000" style="s2">really worth getting it right because</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.160" end="00:58:33.599" style="s2">i&#39;ve seen pushback against the true</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.000" end="00:58:34.960" style="s2">point many times and it misunderstands</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.599" end="00:58:37.040" style="s2">something important</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.960" end="00:58:38.319" style="s2">all of us have an equal number of male</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.040" end="00:58:40.000" style="s2">and female ancestors</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.319" end="00:58:41.599" style="s2">because we all have a mother and a</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.000" end="00:58:43.280" style="s2">father and our mother</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.599" end="00:58:44.640" style="s2">had a mother and a father and our father</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.280" end="00:58:46.079" style="s2">had a mother and father and back and</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.640" end="00:58:48.319" style="s2">back and back and back</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.079" end="00:58:49.920" style="s2">so except in what under every</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.319" end="00:58:50.640" style="s2">circumstance would have been a very rare</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.920" end="00:58:52.799" style="s2">case</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.640" end="00:58:55.040" style="s2">of incest such that your father was also</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.799" end="00:58:57.200" style="s2">your grandfather or something and</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.040" end="00:58:58.880" style="s2">yes that has been rare throughout human</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.200" end="00:59:01.760" style="s2">history</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.880" end="00:59:03.359" style="s2">we all have basically equal numbers of</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.760" end="00:59:05.680" style="s2">male and female ancestors</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.359" end="00:59:07.599" style="s2">it is also true though the reason that</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.680" end="00:59:10.000" style="s2">people are confused about this</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.599" end="00:59:10.799" style="s2">is that uh in a highly pollutionist</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.000" end="00:59:13.839" style="s2">situation</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.799" end="00:59:16.559" style="s2">in which all females have mates but</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.839" end="00:59:19.280" style="s2">many males don&#39;t ever have mates there</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.559" end="00:59:21.200" style="s2">are many males who do not reproduce</p>

<p begin="00:59:33.599" end="00:59:38.000" style="s2">is that any individual has more male or</p>

<p begin="01:00:10.319" end="01:00:13.680" style="s2">excellent adventure to know how that</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.240" end="01:00:15.200" style="s2">time stamp was arranged</p>

<p begin="01:00:15.200" end="01:00:17.760" style="s2">think you watched it with the kids i</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.559" end="01:00:18.880" style="s2">think i was just out of town or</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.760" end="01:00:21.440" style="s2">something like bill and ted&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.880" end="01:00:23.200" style="s2">i know it&#39;s such a gen x thing i i want</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.440" end="01:00:25.920" style="s2">a do-over on like the last</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.200" end="01:00:26.839" style="s2">three decades wow that&#39;s the thing that</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.920" end="01:00:28.799" style="s2">did it</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.839" end="01:00:30.319" style="s2">amazing no i just want to make sure that</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.799" end="01:00:32.640" style="s2">we&#39;re on the same concern</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.319" end="01:00:34.160" style="s2">just like what guys really i&#39;ll watch it</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.640" end="01:00:35.839" style="s2">with you when was that</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.160" end="01:00:37.920" style="s2">bill and ted yeah it must have been</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.839" end="01:00:38.400" style="s2">early mid 90s ish something like that</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.920" end="01:00:40.079" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.400" end="01:00:41.280" style="s2">yeah yeah it&#39;s important stuff</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.079" end="01:00:42.160" style="s2">especially if you want to get your time</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.280" end="01:00:44.799" style="s2">travel stuff right</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.160" end="01:00:46.160" style="s2">i see more important than uh than uh</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.799" end="01:00:48.079" style="s2">back to the future</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.160" end="01:00:50.000" style="s2">um you know back to back to the future</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.079" end="01:00:51.440" style="s2">is uh you know it&#39;s just it&#39;s a more</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.000" end="01:00:53.200" style="s2">standard approach</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.440" end="01:00:56.319" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s not as much george carlin you</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.200" end="01:00:58.000" style="s2">know whatever okay do you have any</p>

<p begin="01:00:58.000" end="01:01:00.720" style="s2">is there anything you can say about it</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.200" end="01:01:02.960" style="s2">from an evolutionary perspective and</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.720" end="01:01:05.200" style="s2">about potential for treatment</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.960" end="01:01:06.400" style="s2">um i would i&#39;m gonna actually so you say</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.200" end="01:01:08.799" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna say but i&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.400" end="01:01:10.559" style="s2">flag this and think about a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.799" end="01:01:11.359" style="s2">because yeah i have had some thoughts</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.559" end="01:01:12.880" style="s2">about it but</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.359" end="01:01:13.839" style="s2">nothing is at the forefront of my mind</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.880" end="01:01:15.520" style="s2">right now actually zach could you</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.839" end="01:01:18.319" style="s2">highlight that</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.520" end="01:01:19.520" style="s2">the one i&#39;ve got almost highlighted</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.319" end="01:01:21.280" style="s2">thank you</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.520" end="01:01:22.559" style="s2">yeah i mean i think there&#39;s not too much</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.280" end="01:01:25.680" style="s2">to say except that</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.559" end="01:01:28.799" style="s2">it is a tragic case in which uh</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.680" end="01:01:32.000" style="s2">it&#39;s a deleterious recessive</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.799" end="01:01:35.200" style="s2">trait i believe and</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.000" end="01:01:37.760" style="s2">that the catastrophic</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.200" end="01:01:39.680" style="s2">consequences of it happen somewhat late</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.760" end="01:01:42.160" style="s2">in life not all that late but</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.680" end="01:01:44.160" style="s2">late enough that a lot of reproduction</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.160" end="01:01:46.000" style="s2">happens in advance of it which explains</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.160" end="01:01:48.799" style="s2">in part why it</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.000" end="01:01:50.319" style="s2">is resistant to selection having</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.799" end="01:01:51.599" style="s2">eliminated it now there&#39;s a question</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.319" end="01:01:53.040" style="s2">also about whether it&#39;s tied to</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.599" end="01:01:56.960" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.040" end="01:01:58.319" style="s2">positive that might account for</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.960" end="01:02:00.160" style="s2">it being even more resistant to</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.319" end="01:02:03.039" style="s2">selection but i don&#39;t know and it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.160" end="01:02:04.480" style="s2">years since i thought about it what is</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.039" end="01:02:06.000" style="s2">the game theory of alternative voting</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.480" end="01:02:07.359" style="s2">methods like ranked choice voting</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.000" end="01:02:09.359" style="s2">and approval voting do you think we</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.359" end="01:02:11.200" style="s2">should switch to a new system</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.359" end="01:02:13.119" style="s2">uh yeah i would say we do need a new</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.200" end="01:02:16.240" style="s2">system because first past the post is</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.119" end="01:02:18.160" style="s2">uh part of the the</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.240" end="01:02:20.000" style="s2">flaw in our system that is making it so</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.160" end="01:02:21.440" style="s2">hard to solve problems by defaulting to</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.000" end="01:02:24.240" style="s2">a two-party arrangement</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.440" end="01:02:26.640" style="s2">which tends towards incoherence and i</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.240" end="01:02:29.599" style="s2">would argue corruption so yes we do need</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.640" end="01:02:31.119" style="s2">we do need to rethink this but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.599" end="01:02:32.880" style="s2">not to say you couldn&#39;t graft something</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.119" end="01:02:34.559" style="s2">onto the system that would work with the</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.880" end="01:02:36.880" style="s2">current structure that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.559" end="01:02:38.480" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.880" end="01:02:40.319" style="s2">could the differences in covet infection</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.480" end="01:02:42.240" style="s2">rate across the world be explained by</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.319" end="01:02:44.240" style="s2">stronger or weaker immune difference</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.240" end="01:02:48.079" style="s2">defenses in different regions is there</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.240" end="01:02:51.440" style="s2">any data focusing on this</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.079" end="01:02:52.480" style="s2">seems very unlikely because uh humans</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.440" end="01:02:55.200" style="s2">need an immune</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.480" end="01:02:55.839" style="s2">system regardless and you can control</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.200" end="01:02:57.839" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.839" end="01:02:59.359" style="s2">any factor that i can think of you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.839" end="01:03:01.760" style="s2">it&#39;s not like it&#39;s the developing world</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.359" end="01:03:05.520" style="s2">versus the developed world</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.760" end="01:03:07.760" style="s2">or ethnicity or age</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.520" end="01:03:08.640" style="s2">or any number of the things that we</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.760" end="01:03:11.760" style="s2">imagine</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.640" end="01:03:12.319" style="s2">might have some variance in immune</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.760" end="01:03:15.680" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.319" end="01:03:16.960" style="s2">between so you know you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.680" end="01:03:19.440" style="s2">i don&#39;t know and it&#39;s gonna depend a</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.960" end="01:03:22.720" style="s2">little bit on where you draw the lines</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.440" end="01:03:25.200" style="s2">um there could easily be</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.720" end="01:03:27.359" style="s2">uh major histocompatibility differences</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.200" end="01:03:29.680" style="s2">that matter just as there are apparently</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.359" end="01:03:30.960" style="s2">um surface antigen differences on red</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.680" end="01:03:32.559" style="s2">blood cells which are not strictly</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.960" end="01:03:33.200" style="s2">speaking immune that&#39;s to say blood</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.559" end="01:03:35.440" style="s2">groups</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.200" end="01:03:37.839" style="s2">um anyway there&#39;s all kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.440" end="01:03:39.119" style="s2">opportunity for molecular differences or</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.839" end="01:03:42.160" style="s2">differences in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.119" end="01:03:43.359" style="s2">proteases that do the cleaving there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.160" end="01:03:44.319" style="s2">all kinds of places that there could be</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.359" end="01:03:46.000" style="s2">biases</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.319" end="01:03:48.000" style="s2">i don&#39;t think we know what they mean nor</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.000" end="01:03:50.960" style="s2">do they necessarily mean anything</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.000" end="01:03:53.039" style="s2">it could just be idiosyncratic molecular</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.960" end="01:03:54.000" style="s2">features that make some cells easier to</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.039" end="01:03:56.000" style="s2">invade than others</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.000" end="01:03:57.920" style="s2">yeah i mean i guess one thing that</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.000" end="01:03:59.520" style="s2">occurs to me is that very early on when</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.920" end="01:04:00.640" style="s2">we were talking about uh when we were</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.520" end="01:04:04.000" style="s2">seeing the emerging</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.640" end="01:04:06.240" style="s2">uh horror in guaykeel in ecuador um</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.000" end="01:04:07.920" style="s2">that was at this you know we had we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.240" end="01:04:09.680" style="s2">just previously to that this would have</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.920" end="01:04:12.799" style="s2">been like early april</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.680" end="01:04:15.200" style="s2">uh noted that is it</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.799" end="01:04:17.599" style="s2">a blood type that is somewhat more</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.200" end="01:04:19.839" style="s2">resistant to cover 19</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.599" end="01:04:21.680" style="s2">and b that is somewhat less resistant i</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.839" end="01:04:22.960" style="s2">can&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.680" end="01:04:24.319" style="s2">i thought it was o that was more</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.960" end="01:04:26.079" style="s2">resistant oh it&#39;s more resistant a</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.319" end="01:04:27.520" style="s2">that&#39;s more susceptible that&#39;s it oh</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.079" end="01:04:28.960" style="s2">that&#39;s more resistant in a that is more</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.520" end="01:04:32.319" style="s2">susceptible</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.960" end="01:04:33.280" style="s2">and um oh blood types i believe i think</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.319" end="01:04:35.920" style="s2">i&#39;m getting this right</p>

<p begin="01:04:35.920" end="01:04:39.119" style="s2">america</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.559" end="01:04:41.280" style="s2">than anywhere else in the world and so</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.119" end="01:04:41.920" style="s2">you know those those two observations</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.280" end="01:04:44.640" style="s2">run in</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.920" end="01:04:45.440" style="s2">opposite directions um suggesting that</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.640" end="01:04:48.559" style="s2">even with</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.440" end="01:04:49.760" style="s2">some underlying immunological uh</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.559" end="01:04:51.839" style="s2">explanation that would appear to be</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.760" end="01:04:52.480" style="s2">protective uh we have quite the opposite</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.839" end="01:04:55.920" style="s2">result</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.480" end="01:04:59.119" style="s2">so um that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.920" end="01:05:01.440" style="s2">merely a sort of vague verificationist</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.119" end="01:05:03.280" style="s2">approach to my sense that this is going</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.440" end="01:05:05.520" style="s2">to end up having been political</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.280" end="01:05:07.280" style="s2">rather than underlying anatomy or</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.520" end="01:05:10.000" style="s2">physiology</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.280" end="01:05:10.480" style="s2">yeah sociological um that explains the</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.000" end="01:05:12.240" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.480" end="01:05:14.960" style="s2">very different results that different</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.240" end="01:05:14.960" style="s2">countries are getting</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.119" end="01:05:18.319" style="s2">hour and five minutes okay let&#39;s do five</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.920" end="01:05:22.640" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.319" end="01:05:25.520" style="s2">okay five more sure um first</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.640" end="01:05:26.960" style="s2">wait did we just do yeah first thank you</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.520" end="01:05:27.520" style="s2">so much for being a sane voice in these</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.960" end="01:05:29.599" style="s2">times</p>

<p begin="01:05:29.599" end="01:05:32.880" style="s2">there are a couple of guests i wonder if</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.039" end="01:05:36.400" style="s2">you might be able to have on someday</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.880" end="01:05:38.799" style="s2">andrew yang and professor richard wolff</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.400" end="01:05:40.240" style="s2">do you know richard wolff uh richard</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.799" end="01:05:43.359" style="s2">wolff don&#39;t know him</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.240" end="01:05:46.000" style="s2">personally okay um good suggestions</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.359" end="01:05:47.520" style="s2">okay how do you guys think about</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.000" end="01:05:49.039" style="s2">meditation and mindfulness from an</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.520" end="01:05:50.240" style="s2">evolutionary perspective</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.039" end="01:05:51.440" style="s2">related to finding ourselves in</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.240" end="01:05:53.359" style="s2">different circumstances from our</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.440" end="01:05:57.119" style="s2">ancestors question mark or making us</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.359" end="01:05:59.599" style="s2">more able to achieve flow states</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.119" end="01:06:01.359" style="s2">um well i mean i think this actually</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.599" end="01:06:05.039" style="s2">fits into our model pretty well</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.359" end="01:06:07.920" style="s2">yeah you have a border between what is</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.039" end="01:06:10.559" style="s2">conscious and what is below conscious</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.920" end="01:06:12.640" style="s2">but that border is set based on</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.559" end="01:06:14.640" style="s2">what has on average been useful to your</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.640" end="01:06:16.720" style="s2">ancestors and there&#39;s nothing to say</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.640" end="01:06:18.319" style="s2">that it is the right border for the</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.720" end="01:06:19.760" style="s2">circumstance you&#39;re in or for modern</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.319" end="01:06:22.960" style="s2">life or any of those things</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.760" end="01:06:25.119" style="s2">and so by concentrating on that border</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.960" end="01:06:26.400" style="s2">you can transgress it and you can</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.119" end="01:06:28.079" style="s2">discover stuff which is</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.400" end="01:06:30.480" style="s2">you know mindfulness is one way to do</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.079" end="01:06:32.480" style="s2">this humor is another way to do it</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.480" end="01:06:33.599" style="s2">music is another way to do it</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.480" end="01:06:36.720" style="s2">hallucinogens are</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.599" end="01:06:38.480" style="s2">yet another way to do it and so</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.720" end="01:06:39.839" style="s2">basically there are lots of hacks that</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.480" end="01:06:41.920" style="s2">allow you to see</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.839" end="01:06:43.440" style="s2">what&#39;s just over that border and the</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.920" end="01:06:45.359" style="s2">better at those hacks you get the</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.440" end="01:06:47.760" style="s2">further over the border you can go</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.359" end="01:06:48.480" style="s2">and whether you can drag something back</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.760" end="01:06:52.319" style="s2">across it</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.480" end="01:06:54.000" style="s2">that is useful depends</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.319" end="01:06:56.079" style="s2">i would also say that we do this in</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.000" end="01:06:59.359" style="s2">sleep where most of our</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.079" end="01:07:00.400" style="s2">dreams are not accessible by our</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.359" end="01:07:03.520" style="s2">conscious mind</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.400" end="01:07:05.119" style="s2">but especially if you um you know take a</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.520" end="01:07:06.319" style="s2">hammer to your alarm clock or your phone</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.119" end="01:07:07.920" style="s2">or whatever it is that wakes you up and</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.319" end="01:07:09.280" style="s2">allow yourself to wake up normally you</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.920" end="01:07:10.720" style="s2">will find that sometimes your</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.280" end="01:07:12.720" style="s2">subconscious mind</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.720" end="01:07:14.880" style="s2">hands stuff over to your conscious mind</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.720" end="01:07:16.240" style="s2">at waking and that oftentimes those</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.880" end="01:07:17.920" style="s2">things that are handed over are not</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.240" end="01:07:19.440" style="s2">preposterous nonsense they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.920" end="01:07:22.720" style="s2">useful insight</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.440" end="01:07:24.319" style="s2">so something like that that&#39;s good i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.720" end="01:07:25.760" style="s2">leave it at that</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.319" end="01:07:27.200" style="s2">how can scientists advocate for</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.760" end="01:07:28.720" style="s2">lockdowns when they didn&#39;t say anything</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.200" end="01:07:30.559" style="s2">about mass rioting and</p>

<p begin="01:07:58.960" end="01:08:04.799" style="s2">uh on the other hand um the</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.880" end="01:08:06.000" style="s2">protests at least when they were</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.799" end="01:08:09.039" style="s2">protests</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.000" end="01:08:11.119" style="s2">uh are likely to be less</p>

<p begin="01:08:17.520" end="01:08:21.600" style="s2">a justification it is not me saying it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.480" end="01:08:25.120" style="s2">just fine</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.600" end="01:08:26.080" style="s2">um but certainly the protests that were</p>

<p begin="01:08:26.080" end="01:08:30.799" style="s2">during the day when the sun was shining</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.159" end="01:08:33.759" style="s2">um would have had less chance of</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.799" end="01:08:34.960" style="s2">uh transmitting the virus than um</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.759" end="01:08:37.839" style="s2">anything indoors</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.960" end="01:08:40.000" style="s2">even in smaller numbers um or those</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.839" end="01:08:41.520" style="s2">protests that continue after dark when</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.000" end="01:08:42.799" style="s2">the sun is no longer enabling you to</p>

<p begin="01:08:50.239" end="01:08:52.000" style="s2">right thing for us to do is get serious</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.759" end="01:08:54.480" style="s2">about</p>

<p begin="01:08:55.679" end="01:09:00.640" style="s2">right yes they should have been much</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.319" end="01:09:02.319" style="s2">more responsible about talking about</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.640" end="01:09:04.560" style="s2">protest and its interaction with the</p>

<p begin="01:09:04.560" end="01:09:07.759" style="s2">so uh screw him for not being clear</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.040" end="01:09:11.279" style="s2">about it but</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.759" end="01:09:13.759" style="s2">um if we should lock down for our</p>

<p begin="01:09:35.279" end="01:09:40.080" style="s2">right the right thing to do is to uh</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.640" end="01:09:42.239" style="s2">make sure that the opportunity is as</p>

<p begin="01:10:05.840" end="01:10:12.480" style="s2">uh yeah i&#39;ll just stop there</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.840" end="01:10:13.120" style="s2">um the next one is supposed to be our</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.480" end="01:10:16.480" style="s2">last one</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.120" end="01:10:18.000" style="s2">we may go one more brett how certain are</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.480" end="01:10:19.440" style="s2">you of the fact that the virus emerged</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.000" end="01:10:20.719" style="s2">from a laboratory setting and not from</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.440" end="01:10:21.600" style="s2">the wet markets as we were told</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.719" end="01:10:23.280" style="s2">originally</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.600" end="01:10:24.719" style="s2">well even the chinese say it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.280" end="01:10:26.400" style="s2">web market at this point</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.719" end="01:10:29.440" style="s2">so nobody thinks it&#39;s the web market i</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.400" end="01:10:30.960" style="s2">didn&#39;t know that i didn&#39;t know they&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.440" end="01:10:32.800" style="s2">yeah reversed yeah it&#39;s not it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.960" end="01:10:35.120" style="s2">wet market that that much we know</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.800" end="01:10:38.400" style="s2">um so you should you should watch the</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.120" end="01:10:40.159" style="s2">brett&#39;s conversation with yuri</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.400" end="01:10:42.719" style="s2">yep yeah and i will say there&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.159" end="01:10:45.199" style="s2">bunch of stuff that i&#39;m eager to cover</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.719" end="01:10:45.840" style="s2">since we talked a lot about covin and i</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.199" end="01:10:49.040" style="s2">talked with</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.840" end="01:10:51.040" style="s2">yuri another lab leak hypothesis emerged</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.040" end="01:10:52.080" style="s2">this week which i found fascinating i</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.040" end="01:10:55.520" style="s2">think it&#39;s crazy</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.080" end="01:10:58.560" style="s2">but another version emerged a</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.520" end="01:11:01.120" style="s2">very good paper which argues</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.560" end="01:11:02.560" style="s2">that the missing period of time that is</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.120" end="01:11:04.800" style="s2">to say the time when</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.560" end="01:11:07.040" style="s2">the virus would have evolved to get good</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.800" end="01:11:09.920" style="s2">at infecting humans which is</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.040" end="01:11:12.800" style="s2">absent from our current time series and</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.920" end="01:11:16.400" style="s2">conspicuously so their claim</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.800" end="01:11:18.800" style="s2">is it&#39;s a hypothesis it&#39;s well presented</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.400" end="01:11:21.840" style="s2">the hypothesis is that that period of</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.800" end="01:11:23.199" style="s2">time was accelerated and took place</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.840" end="01:11:25.040" style="s2">depending upon how you read the paper</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.199" end="01:11:27.280" style="s2">either in the lungs of</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.040" end="01:11:30.159" style="s2">one of the six miners who got infected</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.280" end="01:11:32.640" style="s2">in yunnan in 2012</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.159" end="01:11:35.280" style="s2">or conceivably i guess it could have</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.640" end="01:11:36.800" style="s2">gone from one minor to another but</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.280" end="01:11:39.199" style="s2">it can&#39;t have been more than a couple of</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.800" end="01:11:41.120" style="s2">them but the idea is that this long</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.199" end="01:11:42.719" style="s2">period of time of evolution or this long</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.120" end="01:11:44.719" style="s2">sequence of evolutionary steps that we</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.719" end="01:11:45.440" style="s2">would expect to see took place in the</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.719" end="01:11:47.120" style="s2">lungs</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.440" end="01:11:49.040" style="s2">of these miners which would have been an</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.120" end="01:11:50.640" style="s2">odd place for a coronavirus to be which</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.040" end="01:11:51.520" style="s2">would have accelerated the rate of</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.640" end="01:11:54.480" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.520" end="01:11:56.640" style="s2">and that basically a tissue sample from</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.480" end="01:11:59.040" style="s2">one of these miners made it to</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.640" end="01:12:02.159" style="s2">wuhan which is why it emerges there at</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.040" end="01:12:05.280" style="s2">the wuhan institute or on its doorstep</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.159" end="01:12:05.920" style="s2">because that tissue escaped so the point</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.280" end="01:12:09.040" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.920" end="01:12:11.199" style="s2">natural virus intermediate is a human</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.040" end="01:12:12.560" style="s2">and it then gets transported to wuhan</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.199" end="01:12:15.120" style="s2">where it accidentally escapes</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.560" end="01:12:16.640" style="s2">i think this is nuts i i can&#39;t imagine</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.120" end="01:12:18.239" style="s2">that this is the right explanation but</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.640" end="01:12:20.560" style="s2">let&#39;s put it this way</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.239" end="01:12:22.560" style="s2">your plausible alternative lab escape</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.560" end="01:12:23.679" style="s2">hypothesis is now also circulating it</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.560" end="01:12:25.679" style="s2">belongs on the map</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.679" end="01:12:27.520" style="s2">of various possible hypotheses and what</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.679" end="01:12:28.239" style="s2">i would say is the number of people who</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.520" end="01:12:31.040" style="s2">are now</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.239" end="01:12:31.679" style="s2">carefully ready to explore the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.040" end="01:12:33.840" style="s2">lab leak</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.679" end="01:12:37.040" style="s2">gain of function this landscape is</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.840" end="01:12:39.120" style="s2">growing and it&#39;s about time so</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.040" end="01:12:41.280" style="s2">that&#39;s good the question was how certain</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.120" end="01:12:41.920" style="s2">am i not certain but i would say at this</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.280" end="01:12:44.960" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.920" end="01:12:47.600" style="s2">i would say 90</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.960" end="01:12:49.600" style="s2">chance is conservative i think the</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.600" end="01:12:50.560" style="s2">chances are very high it emerged from a</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.600" end="01:12:52.880" style="s2">lab and</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.560" end="01:12:55.440" style="s2">also very high that it was enhanced in</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.880" end="01:12:55.440" style="s2">that lab</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.679" end="01:13:01.199" style="s2">and then the last part of the question</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.440" end="01:13:04.000" style="s2">was oh the yeah not the wet market</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.199" end="01:13:04.719" style="s2">last question why do adjunct professors</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.000" end="01:13:08.400" style="s2">get paid</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.719" end="01:13:12.000" style="s2">so poorly um because we over produce</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.400" end="01:13:14.640" style="s2">phds and that allows</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.000" end="01:13:16.320" style="s2">colleges and universities to hire people</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.640" end="01:13:18.000" style="s2">without committing to them because</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.320" end="01:13:20.239" style="s2">there&#39;s always a dozen to take</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.000" end="01:13:22.239" style="s2">their job should they decide to demand</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.239" end="01:13:24.159" style="s2">more and for those who don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.239" end="01:13:25.840" style="s2">what probably almost everyone has heard</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.159" end="01:13:27.600" style="s2">the term adjunct but if you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.840" end="01:13:30.560" style="s2">what it means on the ground</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.600" end="01:13:32.000" style="s2">what it usually means especially at uh</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.560" end="01:13:34.320" style="s2">research universities where</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.000" end="01:13:35.600" style="s2">a lot of the money that is used to run</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.320" end="01:13:37.280" style="s2">the university is coming in through</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.600" end="01:13:40.159" style="s2">federal grants</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.280" end="01:13:42.239" style="s2">is those professors who are largely</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.159" end="01:13:43.840" style="s2">doing research and it&#39;s the money they</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.239" end="01:13:45.920" style="s2">bring in doing the research that funds</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.840" end="01:13:47.520" style="s2">the universities</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.920" end="01:13:49.199" style="s2">are supposed to be teaching as well</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.520" end="01:13:50.640" style="s2">you&#39;re supposed to be doing research and</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.199" end="01:13:52.800" style="s2">educating the undergraduates and</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.640" end="01:13:54.640" style="s2">graduate students at your university</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.800" end="01:13:56.560" style="s2">but most people aren&#39;t very good at</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.640" end="01:13:59.520" style="s2">educating and they don&#39;t want to do it</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.560" end="01:14:01.040" style="s2">anyway because it&#39;s not what gives them</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.520" end="01:14:03.199" style="s2">credibility in the world for the most</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.040" end="01:14:06.080" style="s2">part and so</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.199" end="01:14:07.840" style="s2">uh what universities can do is hire</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.080" end="01:14:09.520" style="s2">extremely cheap labor</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.840" end="01:14:11.760" style="s2">uh which are called adjuncts which have</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.520" end="01:14:14.640" style="s2">who have no job security at all</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.760" end="01:14:15.120" style="s2">and often have to work three or four</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.640" end="01:14:16.480" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.120" end="01:14:18.400" style="s2">at three or four different colleges</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.480" end="01:14:19.679" style="s2">universities at a time teaching the</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.400" end="01:14:20.880" style="s2">undergraduates even at elite</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.679" end="01:14:22.960" style="s2">institutions</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.880" end="01:14:24.239" style="s2">now the more elite the institution the</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.960" end="01:14:27.120" style="s2">lower the ratio</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.239" end="01:14:28.159" style="s2">of uh the the fewer the adjuncts there</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.120" end="01:14:30.239" style="s2">are supposed to be</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.159" end="01:14:32.159" style="s2">but there are adjuncts everywhere so you</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.239" end="01:14:34.800" style="s2">have very poorly paid</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.159" end="01:14:36.000" style="s2">people with no health care no job</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.800" end="01:14:39.360" style="s2">security at all</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.000" end="01:14:41.679" style="s2">teaching even even at the ivies and</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.360" end="01:14:42.400" style="s2">uh and the you know the big elite state</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.679" end="01:14:44.000" style="s2">schools</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.400" end="01:14:45.520" style="s2">uh because what that does is it frees</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.000" end="01:14:48.719" style="s2">the tenured professors</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.520" end="01:14:50.080" style="s2">uh to spend their time asking for money</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.719" end="01:14:53.199" style="s2">from the federal government in the form</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.080" end="01:14:55.679" style="s2">of nsf and nih grants</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.199" end="01:14:56.239" style="s2">yep well that&#39;s hopeful yeah good stuff</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.679" end="01:14:59.520" style="s2">yeah</p>
