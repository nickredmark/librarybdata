<p begin="00:00:00.030" end="00:00:09.780" style="s2">thank you okay no no yeah maybe just</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.660" end="00:00:12.179" style="s2">worth as I said briefly before just</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.780" end="00:00:14.519" style="s2">saying that this is where we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.179" end="00:00:16.740" style="s2">to quite a broad audience here so this</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.519" end="00:00:17.730" style="s2">conversation is going to be trance you</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.740" end="00:00:22.320" style="s2">know we&#39;re going to create it into</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.730" end="00:00:23.670" style="s2">something but yeah it&#39;s for it&#39;s for a</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.320" end="00:00:26.310" style="s2">very broad audience and some of that</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.670" end="00:00:27.930" style="s2">audience won&#39;t have much understanding</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.310" end="00:00:31.619" style="s2">about regenerative cultures so we want</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.930" end="00:00:36.180" style="s2">to make it as not simplify it but make</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.619" end="00:00:37.260" style="s2">it translatable for them so they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.180" end="00:00:41.040" style="s2">to kind of frame that</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.260" end="00:00:43.260" style="s2">so the first yeah the first question and</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.040" end="00:00:45.510" style="s2">kind of my curiosity as much as anybody</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.260" end="00:00:49.260" style="s2">else&#39;s is I&#39;m curious about your story</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.510" end="00:00:51.949" style="s2">and how you started working with the</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.260" end="00:00:54.600" style="s2">concept of regenerative cultures and why</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.949" end="00:00:57.420" style="s2">yeah how did that how did that happen</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.600" end="00:00:59.460" style="s2">well thank you and it&#39;s a good place to</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.420" end="00:01:01.530" style="s2">start because for me a lot of what</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.460" end="00:01:04.290" style="s2">regenerative practice is all about is</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.530" end="00:01:06.540" style="s2">personal development like it starts in</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.290" end="00:01:09.390" style="s2">everybody&#39;s individual story and how</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.540" end="00:01:11.369" style="s2">they find their calling and their</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.390" end="00:01:14.070" style="s2">essence and then try to express it in</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.369" end="00:01:17.400" style="s2">the world and so I when I do interviews</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.070" end="00:01:20.070" style="s2">with people who I consider elders in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.400" end="00:01:21.930" style="s2">regenerative movement I often ask them</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.070" end="00:01:26.040" style="s2">to start with the personal story so</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.930" end="00:01:29.610" style="s2">thank you and I&#39;ve said this before like</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.040" end="00:01:31.500" style="s2">basically I&#39;m I I started like I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.610" end="00:01:33.600" style="s2">German originally and I wanted to be a</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.500" end="00:01:35.490" style="s2">marine biologist and to study whales and</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.600" end="00:01:38.850" style="s2">dolphins and ended up with every</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.490" end="00:01:42.479" style="s2">University studying biology and um and</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.850" end="00:01:46.259" style="s2">then went to California my undergrad get</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.479" end="00:01:48.450" style="s2">to do some research on dolphins and also</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.259" end="00:01:53.520" style="s2">an elephant seals and I had this moment</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.450" end="00:01:54.899" style="s2">at one point where I asked myself with</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.520" end="00:01:57.780" style="s2">everything that&#39;s going on in the world</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.899" end="00:02:01.649" style="s2">these animals that are so loved and that</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.780" end="00:02:03.899" style="s2">I want to dedicate my life to am I most</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.649" end="00:02:07.170" style="s2">likely not going to be here when my</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.899" end="00:02:09.739" style="s2">grandchildren grow up because of our</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.170" end="00:02:12.180" style="s2">actions and then I in a thought of</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.739" end="00:02:14.709" style="s2">because I don&#39;t have this like am I</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.180" end="00:02:18.550" style="s2">going to go into primatology or Sea</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.709" end="00:02:21.760" style="s2">apes or dolphins and two of my great</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.550" end="00:02:24.099" style="s2">heroes were Jane Goodall Dian Fossey and</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.760" end="00:02:28.000" style="s2">they&#39;re very different characters Jane</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.099" end="00:02:30.610" style="s2">Goodall is the saintly nonviolent person</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.000" end="00:02:33.430" style="s2">who just will do her work and has been</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.610" end="00:02:36.220" style="s2">for many decades carrying an amazing</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.430" end="00:02:39.900" style="s2">message and Dian Fossey was more of a</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.220" end="00:02:42.010" style="s2">fiery activist type that that when when</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.900" end="00:02:43.989" style="s2">people started to encroach on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.010" end="00:02:48.819" style="s2">gorillas she was studying she kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.989" end="00:02:50.530" style="s2">tried to like play witchcraft and scare</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.819" end="00:02:53.760" style="s2">them and they they got scared and they</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.530" end="00:02:57.250" style="s2">fought back and they killed her and and</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.760" end="00:02:58.870" style="s2">and so I asked myself what would I do</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.250" end="00:03:04.000" style="s2">with something happen to these animals</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.870" end="00:03:06.640" style="s2">would I have the capacity to be like</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.000" end="00:03:08.769" style="s2">Jane Goodall and and I&#39;m probably not at</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.640" end="00:03:12.250" style="s2">the time I was too too fiery and I felt</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.769" end="00:03:14.890" style="s2">I was more of a than Fauci type and and</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.250" end="00:03:16.510" style="s2">somehow that at that point I made a</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.890" end="00:03:17.709" style="s2">decision that it was not my sensible</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.510" end="00:03:20.410" style="s2">that the best thing I could do for the</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.709" end="00:03:24.850" style="s2">dolphins was actually to work on my own</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.410" end="00:03:26.950" style="s2">species you look at sustainability and</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.850" end="00:03:30.310" style="s2">that&#39;s what what we&#39;re calling it</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.950" end="00:03:31.870" style="s2">and and that started me on a long</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.310" end="00:03:34.480" style="s2">journey I did a master&#39;s in holistic</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.870" end="00:03:37.870" style="s2">science at Omaha College in 2001 and</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.480" end="00:03:40.450" style="s2">that&#39;s where really clicked on the power</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.870" end="00:03:43.750" style="s2">of design like learning from elders like</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.450" end="00:03:45.579" style="s2">John Todd and David or how design was so</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.750" end="00:03:47.019" style="s2">much more than I thought it was about I</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.579" end="00:03:51.280" style="s2">also thought because I was just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.019" end="00:03:52.989" style="s2">making things look pretty so quiet but</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.280" end="00:03:55.030" style="s2">that design is actually just human</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.989" end="00:03:57.239" style="s2">intention on our worldview and what we</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.030" end="00:04:00.970" style="s2">think we need and what we truly need</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.239" end="00:04:04.030" style="s2">translated into somehow us shaping the</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.970" end="00:04:05.859" style="s2">world around us to meet those needs and</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.030" end="00:04:08.019" style="s2">we need to really pay attention how we</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.859" end="00:04:12.069" style="s2">do that because if we do it one way we</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.019" end="00:04:15.220" style="s2">messed things up pretty badly and so in</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.069" end="00:04:17.530" style="s2">2006 I because I always wanted to do</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.220" end="00:04:18.489" style="s2">this big mapping of how all of this fits</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.530" end="00:04:21.549" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.489" end="00:04:26.469" style="s2">so identity tents and and so I wrote</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.549" end="00:04:27.740" style="s2">this 750 pH pH D thesis called design</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.469" end="00:04:30.259" style="s2">for human and Planetary</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.740" end="00:04:32.449" style="s2">of a holistic in tabular approach to</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.259" end="00:04:35.180" style="s2">complexity and sustainability but this</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.449" end="00:04:39.310" style="s2">this was like this whole academic bit</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.180" end="00:04:41.380" style="s2">came after I actually spent two years</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.310" end="00:04:44.599" style="s2">travelling around in a van</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.380" end="00:04:46.729" style="s2">visiting eco villages visiting cats</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.599" end="00:04:49.280" style="s2">doing multiple courses at the Center for</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.729" end="00:04:51.710" style="s2">alternative technology in techniques</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.280" end="00:04:53.960" style="s2">doing long-term volunteer programs</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.710" end="00:04:56.360" style="s2">they&#39;re going to find&#39; horn going to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.960" end="00:04:58.639" style="s2">Layton&#39;s garden in Germany or to</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.360" end="00:05:02.240" style="s2">determine who in Italy all the different</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.639" end="00:05:04.159" style="s2">eco villages and then I moved to region</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.240" end="00:05:07.720" style="s2">and southern Spain and in Juarez where</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.159" end="00:05:10.370" style="s2">back in 1999 I wanted to set up an</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.720" end="00:05:15.849" style="s2">environmental education center and and</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.370" end="00:05:18.830" style="s2">eco village - as I was calling it then</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.849" end="00:05:23.949" style="s2">live the solutions rather than be part</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.830" end="00:05:26.569" style="s2">of the problem and honestly like I did</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.949" end="00:05:28.370" style="s2">all the things that for many people I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.569" end="00:05:31.009" style="s2">seen so many people do it since it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.370" end="00:05:33.380" style="s2">this dream where you just want to bring</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.009" end="00:05:35.210" style="s2">your best friends together and live ever</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.380" end="00:05:39.409" style="s2">after and and you completely think</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.210" end="00:05:41.000" style="s2">you&#39;ll never have any problems and and</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.409" end="00:05:42.800" style="s2">and also I still thought it was all</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.000" end="00:05:46.490" style="s2">about Strawberry buildings and compost</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.800" end="00:05:48.919" style="s2">blues and and solar panels and then I</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.490" end="00:05:50.419" style="s2">realized wow this is much more complex</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.919" end="00:05:53.570" style="s2">there&#39;s a human dimension that I have</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.419" end="00:05:55.070" style="s2">absolutely zero idea about how to how to</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.570" end="00:05:58.729" style="s2">work with the team how to make decisions</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.070" end="00:06:01.250" style="s2">in a circle and also the economic</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.729" end="00:06:03.590" style="s2">dimensions just just basically how do I</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.250" end="00:06:06.169" style="s2">finance this project and how do we make</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.590" end="00:06:09.860" style="s2">a healing project in a degenerative</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.169" end="00:06:13.449" style="s2">economy that is structurally twisted and</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.860" end="00:06:16.460" style="s2">wrong and so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.449" end="00:06:18.349" style="s2">this journey into maja college and all</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.460" end="00:06:21.409" style="s2">this academia was really the the</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.349" end="00:06:23.449" style="s2">practical activist hippy wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.409" end="00:06:24.830" style="s2">learn more how to do it properly and and</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.449" end="00:06:28.370" style="s2">of course then I lost myself a little</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.830" end="00:06:32.419" style="s2">bit in the heavy academia stuff but in</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.370" end="00:06:34.870" style="s2">2006 when my PhD was finished no funding</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.419" end="00:06:37.490" style="s2">council would have funded the extremely</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.870" end="00:06:40.250" style="s2">transdisciplinary research and applied</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.490" end="00:06:41.509" style="s2">research that I wanted to do now that</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.250" end="00:06:43.189" style="s2">would be different but</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.509" end="00:06:46.639" style="s2">the reason that that happened kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.189" end="00:06:49.449" style="s2">pushed me I&#39;m glad now life is always</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.639" end="00:06:52.580" style="s2">like that one door closes another opens</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.449" end="00:06:54.889" style="s2">pushed me to site then I ended up at</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.580" end="00:06:56.779" style="s2">Finland I&#39;m doing the very first eco</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.889" end="00:07:00.499" style="s2">village design education course that by</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.779" end="00:07:02.150" style="s2">education just launched and we did a</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.499" end="00:07:05.210" style="s2">training of trainers there and realized</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.150" end="00:07:06.979" style="s2">that that was a map that was so similar</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.210" end="00:07:08.930" style="s2">like I actually knew that before that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.979" end="00:07:10.669" style="s2">why I did the course because at 2005</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.930" end="00:07:13.849" style="s2">when they first introduced the the</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.669" end="00:07:16.099" style="s2">curriculum idea and Wow that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.849" end="00:07:17.599" style="s2">working on in my PhD and so the reason</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.099" end="00:07:22.310" style="s2">why I went to Finland to do the course</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.599" end="00:07:24.770" style="s2">was to see how this group of educators</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.310" end="00:07:29.270" style="s2">out of the kind of eco village activism</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.770" end="00:07:31.819" style="s2">movement had brought together practices</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.270" end="00:07:33.740" style="s2">in the same sort of theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.819" end="00:07:36.889" style="s2">framework that I was working around my</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.740" end="00:07:38.659" style="s2">PhD and so when I did that course I did</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.889" end="00:07:41.809" style="s2">it more to see how they were teaching it</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.659" end="00:07:44.360" style="s2">rather than what the content was and and</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.809" end="00:07:47.060" style="s2">ever since then I&#39;ve been working with</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.360" end="00:07:51.649" style="s2">Gaia education and and putting all the</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.060" end="00:07:54.289" style="s2">kind of more backed up content with lots</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.649" end="00:07:55.999" style="s2">of books to read and and the stories</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.289" end="00:07:58.789" style="s2">told of people having done it before</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.999" end="00:08:01.699" style="s2">that we can learn from em and I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.789" end="00:08:06.229" style="s2">writing that into Gaia education work so</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.699" end="00:08:07.909" style="s2">I helped to write the content of their</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.229" end="00:08:10.520" style="s2">online course and and that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.909" end="00:08:14.839" style="s2">traveled now all over the world and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.520" end="00:08:18.770" style="s2">I said to keep it short I spent I spent</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.839" end="00:08:20.330" style="s2">ten years after that putting things into</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.770" end="00:08:21.889" style="s2">action living at film home for four</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.330" end="00:08:23.930" style="s2">years then I&#39;ve moved here to Majorca</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.889" end="00:08:27.499" style="s2">because I&#39;m interested in by a regional</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.930" end="00:08:29.889" style="s2">scale change and I&#39;m just on a journey I</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.499" end="00:08:32.690" style="s2">really think it&#39;s it&#39;s an ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.889" end="00:08:35.510" style="s2">apprenticeship in pilgrimage that that</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.690" end="00:08:38.180" style="s2">we&#39;re all on to somehow understand how</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.510" end="00:08:40.610" style="s2">can we best serve and since my book came</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.180" end="00:08:42.560" style="s2">out I&#39;ve realised that there is a power</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.610" end="00:08:44.600" style="s2">in social media of just putting the</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.560" end="00:08:46.310" style="s2">stuff out there to start conversations</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.600" end="00:08:49.880" style="s2">and then trust that people pick it up</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.310" end="00:08:51.560" style="s2">and because it&#39;s I love questions rather</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.880" end="00:08:53.600" style="s2">than answers I think we jump to</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.560" end="00:08:55.430" style="s2">smoothing far too quickly apps</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.600" end="00:08:57.980" style="s2">because the minute you give people a</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.430" end="00:09:00.530" style="s2">question to ask then you really want</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.980" end="00:09:03.020" style="s2">them to involve themselves you&#39;re asking</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.530" end="00:09:04.820" style="s2">them is this meaningful to me what have</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.020" end="00:09:07.400" style="s2">I could contribute to them like it</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.820" end="00:09:10.600" style="s2">join the conversation if you give them a</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.400" end="00:09:13.100" style="s2">principle and they they kind of I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.600" end="00:09:18.800" style="s2">asked to say I agree with that principle</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.100" end="00:09:20.660" style="s2">when I join you yeah that&#39;s great I mean</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.800" end="00:09:22.760" style="s2">there&#39;s so much there that I resonate</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.660" end="00:09:25.250" style="s2">with personally and especially that I</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.760" end="00:09:28.490" style="s2">feel like questions are a doorway into</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.250" end="00:09:31.280" style="s2">into learning aren&#39;t they like if you</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.490" end="00:09:33.800" style="s2">have a statement then it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.280" end="00:09:36.740" style="s2">it&#39;s a bit harder to unpack that</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.800" end="00:09:38.630" style="s2">statement and kind of learn about it</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.740" end="00:09:40.460" style="s2">whereas if you have a question you have</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.630" end="00:09:42.830" style="s2">to arrive at the statement yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.460" end="00:09:45.320" style="s2">that journey is there I feel like is the</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.830" end="00:09:47.540" style="s2">growth is the development and we I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.320" end="00:09:51.230" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m really interested in that and</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.540" end="00:09:53.510" style="s2">also what you say about yeah we all have</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.230" end="00:09:57.560" style="s2">this dream of starting an eco village or</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.510" end="00:10:01.250" style="s2">a you know beautiful community and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.560" end="00:10:04.190" style="s2">so right that the interpersonal human</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.250" end="00:10:07.330" style="s2">dynamics are just as much part of that</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.190" end="00:10:09.980" style="s2">as any kind of structural economic</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.330" end="00:10:15.770" style="s2">aspect and so it&#39;s really great to hear</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.980" end="00:10:17.480" style="s2">you name that so in a few sentences how</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.770" end="00:10:19.340" style="s2">might you explain what regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.480" end="00:10:23.600" style="s2">cultures is to someone who&#39;s like never</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.340" end="00:10:24.980" style="s2">heard about it who may be yeah I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.600" end="00:10:26.780" style="s2">going to give more context just like</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.980" end="00:10:35.480" style="s2">someone who&#39;s never heard about who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.780" end="00:10:38.090" style="s2">heard about the context the concept not</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.480" end="00:10:39.860" style="s2">necessarily an easy question it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.090" end="00:10:42.890" style="s2">question of course that I get asked a</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.860" end="00:10:46.190" style="s2">lot and I&#39;m trying to get the same</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.890" end="00:10:52.660" style="s2">answer and bring it different wants to</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.190" end="00:10:55.280" style="s2">it yeah again I think it is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.660" end="00:10:58.130" style="s2">process of inquiry like we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.280" end="00:11:02.360" style="s2">talking about questions and so it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.130" end="00:11:09.040" style="s2">a continuous personal and team or</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.360" end="00:11:11.720" style="s2">community based inquiry into how we can</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.040" end="00:11:15.410" style="s2">bring out the unique essence and</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.720" end="00:11:17.900" style="s2">opportunity that is our unique gift that</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.410" end="00:11:20.540" style="s2">when each person has has has just</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.900" end="00:11:22.880" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing nothing like you there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.540" end="00:11:25.550" style="s2">nothing like me another time in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.880" end="00:11:30.650" style="s2">world or nobody and we are unique and</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.550" end="00:11:32.600" style="s2">and how do we create a culture where</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.650" end="00:11:35.390" style="s2">people can really contribute that</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.600" end="00:11:37.339" style="s2">uniqueness in ways to the larger whole</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.390" end="00:11:41.110" style="s2">their community their ecosystem the</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.339" end="00:11:44.510" style="s2">biosphere in ways that also bring out</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.110" end="00:11:46.970" style="s2">the the maximum potential of that whole</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.510" end="00:11:49.550" style="s2">community so how do we participate well</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.970" end="00:11:51.830" style="s2">in life how do we as Janine Benyus from</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.550" end="00:11:54.710" style="s2">biomimicry as put it beautifully life</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.830" end="00:11:56.870" style="s2">creates conditions conducive to life the</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.710" end="00:12:00.410" style="s2">regenerative culture is constantly on</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.870" end="00:12:02.510" style="s2">the on the quest of understanding how do</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.410" end="00:12:04.580" style="s2">i best create conditions conducive to</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.510" end="00:12:06.320" style="s2">life always sort of myself how do I</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.580" end="00:12:11.089" style="s2">serve my community and how do I serve</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.320" end="00:12:15.500" style="s2">the community of life in in everything I</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.089" end="00:12:19.310" style="s2">do and and so it&#39;s that&#39;s why I&#39;m so</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.500" end="00:12:21.800" style="s2">adamant that that this is a process of</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.310" end="00:12:23.390" style="s2">inquiry that is connected to place and</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.800" end="00:12:27.350" style="s2">therefore it will be different in each</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.390" end="00:12:29.750" style="s2">place culture it&#39;s it&#39;s a plural because</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.350" end="00:12:32.089" style="s2">it will come out slightly differently</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.750" end="00:12:34.670" style="s2">because it&#39;s the essence that informs us</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.089" end="00:12:37.250" style="s2">it&#39;s placed sourced it comes out of like</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.670" end="00:12:39.610" style="s2">even within the UK it will look</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.250" end="00:12:43.190" style="s2">different in Devon than in Sussex right</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.610" end="00:12:45.950" style="s2">and but of course that for me the</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.190" end="00:12:50.570" style="s2">underlying pattern is disability - how</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.950" end="00:12:54.740" style="s2">do we how do we draw from the wisdom of</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.570" end="00:12:58.820" style="s2">many work voices and how do we when we</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.740" end="00:13:01.550" style="s2">see that there are seeming reconcilable</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.820" end="00:13:04.790" style="s2">opposites of opinion how do we what</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.550" end="00:13:06.620" style="s2">other people put them in a box stop</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.790" end="00:13:08.360" style="s2">listening to them label them because</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.620" end="00:13:11.089" style="s2">they just said a trigger word that we</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.360" end="00:13:12.960" style="s2">are against all isn&#39;t competing utterly</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.089" end="00:13:15.450" style="s2">against all forms of capital</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.960" end="00:13:18.029" style="s2">and he still thinks capitalism could be</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.450" end="00:13:19.800" style="s2">redesigned hence and stopped talking to</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.029" end="00:13:22.680" style="s2">this person because he&#39;s not bought it</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.800" end="00:13:25.110" style="s2">yeah well he doesn&#39;t say it&#39;s all done</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.680" end="00:13:28.290" style="s2">it&#39;ll collapse and therefore he&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.110" end="00:13:30.209" style="s2">denial and um stop talking to me to</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.290" end="00:13:32.190" style="s2">really stay in the process and say what</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.209" end="00:13:35.130" style="s2">is this person why are they thinking</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.190" end="00:13:38.910" style="s2">this to stay in that dialogue and to see</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.130" end="00:13:41.850" style="s2">that in what seems like irreconcilable</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.910" end="00:13:44.940" style="s2">opposites there&#39;s potential for a higher</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.850" end="00:13:48.000" style="s2">level resolution of that that we can</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.940" end="00:13:51.110" style="s2">only get to if we stay open to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.000" end="00:13:53.760" style="s2">conversation and for me that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.110" end="00:13:57.410" style="s2">understanding that life is a planetary</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.760" end="00:14:00.720" style="s2">process and we are one in the same time</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.410" end="00:14:03.029" style="s2">emergent properties just parts of that</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.720" end="00:14:05.580" style="s2">process that pop out but we are all</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.029" end="00:14:08.279" style="s2">because we are part everything we do</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.580" end="00:14:10.320" style="s2">like this conversation but every action</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.279" end="00:14:12.899" style="s2">that you do in the rest of you if this</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.320" end="00:14:17.810" style="s2">day affects that larger hole that is</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.899" end="00:14:20.970" style="s2">also you and so once we get that</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.810" end="00:14:21.839" style="s2">responsibility of saying okay it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.970" end="00:14:24.450" style="s2">about the weather</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.839" end="00:14:28.610" style="s2">I changed the world or not just by being</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.450" end="00:14:34.610" style="s2">I am changing the world so how do I be</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.610" end="00:14:38.640" style="s2">not just do but be in a way that I do so</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.610" end="00:14:40.920" style="s2">wisely for the future of all life and</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.640" end="00:14:42.900" style="s2">that that&#39;s for me at the core of of</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.920" end="00:14:44.310" style="s2">this inquiry process of regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.900" end="00:14:49.470" style="s2">cultures but of course there are lots of</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.310" end="00:14:50.610" style="s2">different facets that we can yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.470" end="00:14:54.440" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.610" end="00:14:57.540" style="s2">I&#39;ve been reading adrien-marie Browns</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.440" end="00:14:59.279" style="s2">the commercient strategy and the thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.540" end="00:15:02.670" style="s2">that&#39;s really set out with me from that</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.279" end="00:15:06.420" style="s2">is the yeah this micro and macro scale</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.670" end="00:15:08.579" style="s2">and what I choose to embody on the micro</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.420" end="00:15:10.680" style="s2">will affect the macro in this this kind</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.579" end="00:15:12.060" style="s2">of relationship between them this is</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.680" end="00:15:15.329" style="s2">really great to hear you speak about</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.060" end="00:15:17.910" style="s2">that and yeah I really I&#39;m experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.329" end="00:15:18.959" style="s2">that actually and I think I&#39;m seeing a</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.910" end="00:15:20.700" style="s2">lot of people around me also</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.959" end="00:15:25.470" style="s2">experiencing that they&#39;re kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.700" end="00:15:26.819" style="s2">clicking that inquiry of like this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.470" end="00:15:29.549" style="s2">just about like</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.819" end="00:15:32.309" style="s2">making the changes out there happen but</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.549" end="00:15:36.149" style="s2">it&#39;s about how we create those changes</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.309" end="00:15:38.100" style="s2">both as individuals and collectives yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.149" end="00:15:39.989" style="s2">yeah maybe another thing that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.100" end="00:15:43.410" style="s2">an important thing and that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.989" end="00:15:45.269" style="s2">that&#39;s a tricky one to stick with this</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.410" end="00:15:51.439" style="s2">paradox because on the one hand yes of</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.269" end="00:15:54.449" style="s2">course we have a planetary emergency and</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.439" end="00:15:57.689" style="s2">that is a problem like climate change is</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.449" end="00:15:59.129" style="s2">a problem cascading ecosystems collapse</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.689" end="00:16:02.459" style="s2">is a massive problem</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.129" end="00:16:05.549" style="s2">an obscene inequality is a massive</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.459" end="00:16:09.419" style="s2">problem but truly regenerative practice</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.549" end="00:16:12.419" style="s2">doesn&#39;t start from problem mindsets</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.419" end="00:16:15.269" style="s2">but from potential mindsets it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.419" end="00:16:19.379" style="s2">about finding out what can happen when</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.269" end="00:16:21.059" style="s2">we think differently and therefore begin</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.379" end="00:16:23.850" style="s2">to bring forth the world differently</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.059" end="00:16:25.679" style="s2">together in the the thought of here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.850" end="00:16:30.539" style="s2">problem we need to solve it let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.679" end="00:16:33.720" style="s2">declare war on climate change that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.539" end="00:16:36.269" style="s2">going upstream enough to really say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.720" end="00:16:39.779" style="s2">the mindset of problem solution war</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.269" end="00:16:41.999" style="s2">against it is part of what got us in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.779" end="00:16:44.579" style="s2">first place you if you follow climate</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.999" end="00:16:46.769" style="s2">change upstream then you see okay this</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.579" end="00:16:48.389" style="s2">is cascading ecosystems collapse that</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.769" end="00:16:52.019" style="s2">has been gone going on for centuries</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.389" end="00:16:53.789" style="s2">this is nothing new and like even before</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.019" end="00:16:56.729" style="s2">we started burning fossil fuels with</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.789" end="00:16:59.970" style="s2">agriculture and and with with like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.729" end="00:17:03.149" style="s2">just looking into a project in in</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.970" end="00:17:05.279" style="s2">Siberia yesterday that is rewilding a</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.149" end="00:17:09.720" style="s2">massive area of Siberia but bringing</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.279" end="00:17:11.549" style="s2">back the herds of ungulates that early</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.720" end="00:17:13.620" style="s2">humans killed off and therefore changed</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.549" end="00:17:15.990" style="s2">the vegetation patterns there and</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.620" end="00:17:17.429" style="s2">changed and the whole climate like that</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.990" end="00:17:20.730" style="s2">the fact that when we started hunting</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.429" end="00:17:22.589" style="s2">whales before fossil fuels for fuel that</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.730" end="00:17:24.809" style="s2">was made out of the whale blubber and</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.589" end="00:17:29.250" style="s2">more the the species from the sperm</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.809" end="00:17:31.620" style="s2">whales and that already affected climate</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.250" end="00:17:33.539" style="s2">because the whales got a nutrient pumps</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.620" end="00:17:37.110" style="s2">in the oceans and without and the whales</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.539" end="00:17:38.970" style="s2">and taking krill at the bottom like</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.110" end="00:17:41.510" style="s2">in the deeper areas and then coming up</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.970" end="00:17:44.700" style="s2">the surface to breathe in pooping and</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.510" end="00:17:47.010" style="s2">they fertilize the upper water that then</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.700" end="00:17:48.630" style="s2">enables more of that mountain to grow</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.010" end="00:17:50.580" style="s2">that they later feed on but in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.630" end="00:17:54.059" style="s2">process they they&#39;re massive carbon</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.580" end="00:17:55.559" style="s2">cycles in the oceans and so so we really</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.059" end="00:17:58.470" style="s2">need to understand these larger</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.559" end="00:18:01.559" style="s2">processes in which which we are part of</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.470" end="00:18:04.830" style="s2">and but then if we go further upstream</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.559" end="00:18:07.890" style="s2">like an the canonic system that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.830" end="00:18:10.160" style="s2">got has driven a lot of that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.890" end="00:18:13.770" style="s2">behavior of destroying the planet</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.160" end="00:18:16.650" style="s2">but really that&#39;s also just a symptom</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.770" end="00:18:19.110" style="s2">like the way we designed our economic</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.650" end="00:18:20.669" style="s2">system the mistaken form of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.110" end="00:18:23.549" style="s2">extractive capitalism that we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.669" end="00:18:25.470" style="s2">right now and that is structurally</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.549" end="00:18:28.470" style="s2">dysfunctional and unless we change it</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.470" end="00:18:31.169" style="s2">we&#39;re not going to fundamentally get</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.470" end="00:18:33.210" style="s2">different solutions but ultimately it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.169" end="00:18:36.600" style="s2">on our hearts and our minds ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.210" end="00:18:39.690" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a story about worldview values</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.600" end="00:18:43.110" style="s2">and the narrative the answers we give to</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.690" end="00:18:45.929" style="s2">the question Who am I where am I going</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.110" end="00:18:49.110" style="s2">where do I come from individually and</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.929" end="00:18:51.990" style="s2">and and collectively and to ask like my</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.110" end="00:18:54.030" style="s2">took my book I wrote it somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.990" end="00:18:57.330" style="s2">triggered by the one question that my</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.030" end="00:18:59.280" style="s2">mentor David all asked me in 2006 he</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.330" end="00:19:01.400" style="s2">said he said I mean before we find out</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.280" end="00:19:05.490" style="s2">how to create a human presence on earth</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.400" end="00:19:09.120" style="s2">that is sustainable we need to ask a</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.490" end="00:19:11.280" style="s2">deeper question and that is what is it</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.120" end="00:19:15.690" style="s2">about being human that makes us worth</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.280" end="00:19:18.270" style="s2">being sustained are we worth it and if</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.690" end="00:19:21.450" style="s2">we have a answer to that question from</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.270" end="00:19:23.520" style="s2">that place in each place place or stand</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.450" end="00:19:25.830" style="s2">culture so we can create wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.520" end="00:19:28.440" style="s2">expressions of why we are worth it but</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.830" end="00:19:31.520" style="s2">we need then also to my mind understand</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.440" end="00:19:34.380" style="s2">the diversity that we saw cherish as</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.520" end="00:19:37.470" style="s2">biodiversity is also expressed in us and</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.380" end="00:19:40.590" style="s2">life in our diversity of opinions and so</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.470" end="00:19:42.540" style="s2">how do we build a future together while</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.590" end="00:19:46.850" style="s2">we still disagree on a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.540" end="00:19:50.789" style="s2">because I think we&#39;ll always disagree</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.850" end="00:19:52.829" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s like that&#39;s neat there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.789" end="00:19:55.349" style="s2">doesn&#39;t need it we need it like a meta</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.829" end="00:19:57.239" style="s2">approach in order to be able to meet</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.349" end="00:20:00.359" style="s2">each other in the disagreements and not</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.239" end="00:20:03.239" style="s2">like dip into this kind of canceling</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.359" end="00:20:05.729" style="s2">culture of like you say that words so</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.239" end="00:20:07.709" style="s2">therefore I won&#39;t associate myself with</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.729" end="00:20:09.359" style="s2">you but actually to stay open even</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.709" end="00:20:12.269" style="s2">though there might be disagreement I</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.359" end="00:20:16.169" style="s2">think that&#39;s like a huge yeah like a</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.269" end="00:20:17.789" style="s2">huge there&#39;s work needed there that you</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.169" end="00:20:19.859" style="s2">know you know when you say about</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.789" end="00:20:23.459" style="s2">personal development like that takes</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.859" end="00:20:25.440" style="s2">work you know but when you do it when</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.459" end="00:20:27.179" style="s2">you do that you probably experienced it</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.440" end="00:20:29.579" style="s2">yourself if you try to build a bridge</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.179" end="00:20:32.190" style="s2">between two camps that are a bit</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.579" end="00:20:34.019" style="s2">opposing what you find very quickly is</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.190" end="00:20:37.889" style="s2">you get shot at from both sides of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.019" end="00:20:39.839" style="s2">bridge because in trying to make them</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.889" end="00:20:41.759" style="s2">understand a little bit more where they</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.839" end="00:20:45.119" style="s2">are coming from you sound like them and</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.759" end="00:20:48.089" style="s2">get attacked and even enjoy and like</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.119" end="00:20:50.009" style="s2">vice versa so it that&#39;s the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.089" end="00:20:52.859" style="s2">being aware that that&#39;s gonna keep</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.009" end="00:20:54.269" style="s2">happening and still sitting in the fire</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.859" end="00:20:56.309" style="s2">as Anna Mendell calls it with</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.269" end="00:21:00.109" style="s2">process-oriented psychology sitting in</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.309" end="00:21:02.249" style="s2">that fire saying okay let&#39;s meet in our</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.109" end="00:21:05.279" style="s2">disagreement find that higher ground</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.249" end="00:21:08.029" style="s2">from which we can unleash the potential</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.279" end="00:21:11.369" style="s2">that that is actually an inhumanity to</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.029" end="00:21:12.719" style="s2">true and this is what I believe we need</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.369" end="00:21:14.249" style="s2">to do ultimately that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.719" end="00:21:16.979" style="s2">regenerative cultures everywhere would</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.249" end="00:21:20.969" style="s2">achieve to my mind is to redesign the</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.979" end="00:21:22.949" style="s2">human impact on earth within the</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.969" end="00:21:24.809" style="s2">lifetime of the Genet generations alive</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.949" end="00:21:27.749" style="s2">today from being exploitative and</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.809" end="00:21:30.690" style="s2">extractive and degenerative to being</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.749" end="00:21:33.629" style="s2">healing and regenerative we we are not</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.690" end="00:21:35.549" style="s2">the cancer on the earth we can be a</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.629" end="00:21:38.519" style="s2">healing power if we keep telling the</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.549" end="00:21:41.339" style="s2">story that humans bad always bad we will</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.519" end="00:21:44.069" style="s2">never unleash the potential that we have</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.339" end="00:21:46.319" style="s2">in and we have the responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.069" end="00:21:48.419" style="s2">because we missed what the system so</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.319" end="00:21:51.029" style="s2">badly that we can&#39;t just now walk away</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.419" end="00:21:53.039" style="s2">and say it&#39;s Zenda the adult generation</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.029" end="00:21:57.539" style="s2">saying look at the data generation they</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.039" end="00:22:01.319" style="s2">will solve it and you know we&#39;re all in</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.539" end="00:22:03.419" style="s2">this together absolutely great</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.319" end="00:22:04.590" style="s2">I think you just answered I kind of I</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.419" end="00:22:08.039" style="s2">had a question</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.590" end="00:22:09.570" style="s2">how you know why is this an important</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.039" end="00:22:12.029" style="s2">thing for us to incorporate within our</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.570" end="00:22:13.620" style="s2">activism and more broadly within our</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.029" end="00:22:16.499" style="s2">work towards a better future but I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.620" end="00:22:17.789" style="s2">you&#39;ve sort of named it there but do you</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.499" end="00:22:19.350" style="s2">feel like there&#39;s something there that</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.789" end="00:22:24.269" style="s2">you would like to respond to anyway</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.350" end="00:22:27.299" style="s2">wait for me and I paid drift for me the</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.269" end="00:22:31.409" style="s2">biggest hope of what what we need to</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.299" end="00:22:34.980" style="s2">somehow nurture like it if you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.409" end="00:22:37.850" style="s2">briefly complexity and like complex</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.980" end="00:22:40.799" style="s2">dynamic systems and you can experience</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.850" end="00:22:43.710" style="s2">them with more than three interacting</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.799" end="00:22:45.690" style="s2">variables is a complex dynamic system</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.710" end="00:22:48.990" style="s2">that means every cell in your body every</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.690" end="00:22:51.659" style="s2">organ your body as a whole and your</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.990" end="00:22:53.519" style="s2">family your community ecosystems the</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.659" end="00:22:55.649" style="s2">planet and they&#39;re all nested and</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.519" end="00:22:59.659" style="s2">they&#39;re all the boundaries we put on</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.649" end="00:23:03.389" style="s2">them every thing I just mentioned is</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.659" end="00:23:05.639" style="s2">next it and part of the larger and in</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.389" end="00:23:08.279" style="s2">this complexity is fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.639" end="00:23:10.889" style="s2">unpredictable and uncontrollable that</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.279" end="00:23:13.769" style="s2">means the idea of designing cultures is</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.889" end="00:23:16.080" style="s2">a paradox because on the one hand you</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.769" end="00:23:21.119" style="s2">can&#39;t design culture because because</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.080" end="00:23:22.590" style="s2">culture emerges out of the relationships</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.119" end="00:23:24.330" style="s2">and the interactions and then</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.590" end="00:23:26.970" style="s2">information that flows through the</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.330" end="00:23:29.669" style="s2">system and it&#39;s about the quality and</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.970" end="00:23:33.029" style="s2">not quantity of relationships and</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.669" end="00:23:38.899" style="s2">information that really affects what</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.029" end="00:23:38.899" style="s2">emerges and so so we if we try to</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.619" end="00:23:43.679" style="s2">positively affect what&#39;s going on in</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.090" end="00:23:45.869" style="s2">this larger system that we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.679" end="00:23:48.149" style="s2">have a healing influence on then for me</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.869" end="00:23:52.799" style="s2">that one of the biggest steps right now</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.149" end="00:23:55.710" style="s2">is to link those people activated by X</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.799" end="00:23:58.019" style="s2">are those people activated by Friday is</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.710" end="00:23:59.999" style="s2">for the future there&#39;s a huge amount of</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.019" end="00:24:02.039" style="s2">people all over the globe young people</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.999" end="00:24:06.029" style="s2">and all the people that that have</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.039" end="00:24:08.610" style="s2">finally got that there is it&#39;s not about</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.029" end="00:24:12.350" style="s2">spectator anymore it&#39;s we&#39;re all having</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.610" end="00:24:17.360" style="s2">to step on the stage and play this</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.350" end="00:24:20.179" style="s2">kind of epic act of ulsan Humanity is</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.360" end="00:24:23.120" style="s2">transforming itself last minute to</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.179" end="00:24:25.400" style="s2">respond to a crisis that could mean the</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.120" end="00:24:28.669" style="s2">end of humanity and the end of much life</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.400" end="00:24:30.770" style="s2">on earth and that that&#39;s the the big</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.669" end="00:24:35.570" style="s2">epic that that will play out this</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.770" end="00:24:38.360" style="s2">century and um what we meet is right now</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.570" end="00:24:40.160" style="s2">in my view you know that there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.360" end="00:24:41.870" style="s2">of people in exile who already talk</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.160" end="00:24:43.850" style="s2">about solutions but the perception right</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.870" end="00:24:46.520" style="s2">now is we&#39;re just saying I want you to</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.850" end="00:24:48.740" style="s2">panic or there&#39;s a problem and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.520" end="00:24:51.980" style="s2">an emergency it&#39;s it&#39;s focused on the</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.740" end="00:24:55.520" style="s2">problem if we could connect that whole</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.980" end="00:24:58.480" style="s2">movement to the wonderful regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.520" end="00:25:01.159" style="s2">cultures that already exist which is a</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.480" end="00:25:02.900" style="s2">movement which is the reshare movement</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.159" end="00:25:04.340" style="s2">which is the Eco village movement the</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.900" end="00:25:07.429" style="s2">permaculture movement the agroforestry</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.340" end="00:25:09.260" style="s2">movement but also in the social</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.429" end="00:25:12.320" style="s2">dimensions there&#39;s so much already their</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.260" end="00:25:14.179" style="s2">cultures not just I mean it sound like</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.320" end="00:25:15.740" style="s2">courses you know like nonviolent</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.179" end="00:25:17.270" style="s2">communication but really there&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.740" end="00:25:18.500" style="s2">culture of people that are trained in</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.270" end="00:25:20.240" style="s2">that and know about it there&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.500" end="00:25:22.159" style="s2">culture of socialist people and</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.240" end="00:25:24.200" style="s2">holacracy people there&#39;s a culture of</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.159" end="00:25:26.090" style="s2">people who work with integral theory and</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.200" end="00:25:28.460" style="s2">in each one of them there are people who</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.090" end="00:25:33.860" style="s2">are completely ready to step up and</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.460" end="00:25:36.200" style="s2">share these and facets of regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.860" end="00:25:39.080" style="s2">cultures emerging in all their diversity</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.200" end="00:25:41.120" style="s2">and if we can connect all the people who</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.080" end="00:25:43.250" style="s2">now want to make a difference to these</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.120" end="00:25:46.700" style="s2">practical ways of making the difference</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.250" end="00:25:49.520" style="s2">of learning these capacities doing stuff</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.700" end="00:25:52.130" style="s2">on the ground and asking the question in</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.520" end="00:25:56.240" style="s2">a sort of transition town plus plus plus</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.130" end="00:25:57.950" style="s2">way and that actually plays Aikido with</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.240" end="00:25:59.330" style="s2">sustainable development goals and</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.950" end="00:26:00.740" style="s2">doesn&#39;t say oh that&#39;s a top-down UN</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.330" end="00:26:02.690" style="s2">process don&#39;t want anything to do with</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.740" end="00:26:04.970" style="s2">it I can of course no actually I can use</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.690" end="00:26:07.250" style="s2">the SDGs to have a conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.970" end="00:26:09.830" style="s2">with Town Hall and with businesses in</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.250" end="00:26:12.710" style="s2">this region because they committed to it</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.830" end="00:26:15.080" style="s2">and then I can use that as the entry</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.710" end="00:26:17.539" style="s2">point but begin by by having a</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.080" end="00:26:19.850" style="s2">conversation because you see the human</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.539" end="00:26:22.190" style="s2">relationships and and make these people</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.850" end="00:26:24.860" style="s2">shift a little bit and start a different</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.190" end="00:26:26.020" style="s2">type of dialogue which is more about how</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.860" end="00:26:29.559" style="s2">do we come together</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.020" end="00:26:32.740" style="s2">to regenerate this place so and for me</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.559" end="00:26:35.670" style="s2">that to lodge extend education is</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.740" end="00:26:38.830" style="s2">central there so if we only managed to</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.670" end="00:26:42.160" style="s2">map out an alternative to going to</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.830" end="00:26:44.530" style="s2">university to all those school kids who</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.160" end="00:26:47.290" style="s2">are on Fridays for future demonstrations</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.530" end="00:26:49.030" style="s2">and say you can take a four-year</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.290" end="00:26:50.740" style="s2">apprenticeship where you go to</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.030" end="00:26:52.570" style="s2">ecosystems restoration comes and</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.740" end="00:26:53.920" style="s2">ecovillages and you do online courses</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.570" end="00:26:55.929" style="s2">and you travel and you learn a few</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.920" end="00:26:58.630" style="s2">languages and you build capacity in</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.929" end="00:27:00.880" style="s2">yourself in relationship and you will</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.630" end="00:27:04.300" style="s2">come out four years later with less debt</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.880" end="00:27:06.850" style="s2">and much more experience more employable</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.300" end="00:27:09.940" style="s2">or you might not want to be employed you</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.850" end="00:27:13.390" style="s2">might co-create something and with the</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.940" end="00:27:14.170" style="s2">people you met on the way and that good</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.390" end="00:27:16.210" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.170" end="00:27:20.250" style="s2">so it&#39;s a regenerative culture is for me</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.210" end="00:27:23.080" style="s2">the step beyond we need a rebellion and</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.250" end="00:27:26.440" style="s2">we need to do something it&#39;s this is</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.080" end="00:27:28.980" style="s2">what we need to do right yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.440" end="00:27:31.240" style="s2">really beautiful way of putting it and</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.980" end="00:27:34.450" style="s2">part of the team I&#39;m involved with are</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.240" end="00:27:36.280" style="s2">working on a way to offer that so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.450" end="00:27:37.840" style="s2">really it&#39;s really timely to hear you</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.280" end="00:27:41.290" style="s2">say that because that&#39;s that is</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.840" end="00:27:43.710" style="s2">something that has felt yeah like</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.290" end="00:27:45.370" style="s2">potentially missing it&#39;s like okay we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.710" end="00:27:46.330" style="s2">recognizing that there&#39;s a problem</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.370" end="00:27:49.929" style="s2">there&#39;s people that are becoming</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.330" end="00:27:53.679" style="s2">activated and waking up to this but then</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.929" end="00:27:57.340" style="s2">how do you guide them and support them</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.679" end="00:27:58.809" style="s2">into that co-creation of the future we</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.340" end="00:28:01.720" style="s2">want to see and I think you know you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.809" end="00:28:05.590" style="s2">just answered that one brief thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.720" end="00:28:07.840" style="s2">because if the word activated and I got</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.590" end="00:28:09.520" style="s2">this piece or medium that speaks that is</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.840" end="00:28:12.490" style="s2">also in my book but it&#39;s it&#39;s a story</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.520" end="00:28:13.870" style="s2">that and I got as I said I&#39;ve worked for</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.490" end="00:28:16.900" style="s2">a long time still work with them a</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.870" end="00:28:19.809" style="s2">little bit good and guy education who</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.900" end="00:28:21.820" style="s2">might some extent be because I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.809" end="00:28:23.650" style="s2">on this for a long time this mapping and</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.820" end="00:28:25.870" style="s2">making people aware of what&#39;s all out</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.650" end="00:28:28.270" style="s2">there and how it all fits together in a</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.870" end="00:28:29.920" style="s2">bigger puzzle and and so in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.270" end="00:28:32.500" style="s2">the the guy education online course</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.920" end="00:28:35.110" style="s2">design for sustainability is one of</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.500" end="00:28:37.179" style="s2">those it takes you through these four</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.110" end="00:28:39.670" style="s2">dimensions social ecological economic</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.179" end="00:28:42.040" style="s2">and worldview and in that open</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.670" end="00:28:43.720" style="s2">boxes where you where you begin to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.040" end="00:28:46.630" style="s2">aware oh there&#39;s dragon dreaming there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.720" end="00:28:48.280" style="s2">social history there&#39;s alternative</p>

<p begin="00:28:53.950" end="00:28:59.220" style="s2">and then they can go wherever like</p>

<p begin="00:29:14.830" end="00:29:19.120" style="s2">see my like this is a while ago she said</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.320" end="00:29:22.570" style="s2">I still see myself as an activist but</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.120" end="00:29:24.970" style="s2">for me activism is about getting up</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.570" end="00:29:28.870" style="s2">every morning and after my morning</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.970" end="00:29:32.230" style="s2">meditation ask myself the question what</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.870" end="00:29:35.680" style="s2">do I want to activate power of my</p>

<p begin="00:29:46.960" end="00:29:50.800" style="s2">the evil ones instead although I want to</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.880" end="00:29:53.470" style="s2">activate the story of is there</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.800" end="00:29:55.720" style="s2">possibility to transform all of humanity</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.470" end="00:29:57.760" style="s2">and come from life generating conditions</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.720" end="00:30:00.610" style="s2">can you see is there a place beyond</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.760" end="00:30:03.160" style="s2">mother ring can we engage everyone</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.610" end="00:30:06.640" style="s2">somehow it&#39;s two different stories to</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.160" end="00:30:08.110" style="s2">actively it&#39;s the story of am i separate</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.640" end="00:30:11.200" style="s2">from everyone and the world is just</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.110" end="00:30:13.330" style="s2">showing me and and and and fight the</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.200" end="00:30:16.050" style="s2">world and complain about the situation</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.330" end="00:30:18.850" style="s2">we&#39;re in or activate the story of</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.050" end="00:30:22.060" style="s2">interbeing that that everything is an</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.850" end="00:30:28.180" style="s2">opportunity to engage and and that why</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.060" end="00:30:29.890" style="s2">we can&#39;t choose to large extent what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.180" end="00:30:33.160" style="s2">happening to us we can choose the</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.890" end="00:30:35.680" style="s2">attitude we take towards how we respond</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.160" end="00:30:38.590" style="s2">what&#39;s helping for us and that changes</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.680" end="00:30:43.380" style="s2">everything and so there&#39;s this reframing</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.590" end="00:30:46.240" style="s2">of activism as what am i activating by</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.380" end="00:30:49.990" style="s2">the language I use the thought forms I</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.240" end="00:30:52.450" style="s2">repeat the reactions I do</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.990" end="00:30:53.980" style="s2">I love that that&#39;s so that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.450" end="00:31:00.090" style="s2">brilliant I&#39;m going to be taking that</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.980" end="00:31:04.690" style="s2">and putting it in my pocket thank you</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.090" end="00:31:07.090" style="s2">so yeah so we you mentioned the Fridays</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.690" end="00:31:09.880" style="s2">for future movement there&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.090" end="00:31:11.620" style="s2">there is through the work of various</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.880" end="00:31:14.529" style="s2">different movements and extinction</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.620" end="00:31:16.390" style="s2">rebellion I think there is a lot of fear</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.529" end="00:31:20.559" style="s2">and uncertainty about the future there</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.390" end="00:31:22.600" style="s2">is of this this kind of like yeah sense</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.559" end="00:31:26.799" style="s2">of form of like foreboding that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.600" end="00:31:29.020" style="s2">happening and yeah that fear and incest</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.799" end="00:31:32.770" style="s2">fee there&#39;s a lot better the youth as</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.020" end="00:31:34.299" style="s2">well so how would you see the work of</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.770" end="00:31:38.529" style="s2">regenerative coaches supporting people</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.299" end="00:31:41.200" style="s2">in a post climate change world like if</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.529" end="00:31:45.490" style="s2">we if that happens if that doom and</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.200" end="00:31:47.799" style="s2">gloom that is being spoken about arrives</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.490" end="00:31:49.799" style="s2">like what is the role that regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.799" end="00:31:55.539" style="s2">cultures plays in that in that</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.799" end="00:31:58.870" style="s2">possibility I think that&#39;s another one</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.539" end="00:32:01.539" style="s2">of those where we instead of having</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.870" end="00:32:03.809" style="s2">interesting conversations about the</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.539" end="00:32:08.559" style="s2">dynamics and the potential that right</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.809" end="00:32:13.149" style="s2">like in which as a biologist</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.559" end="00:32:17.770" style="s2">look how evolution happens and how</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.149" end="00:32:24.610" style="s2">novelty emerges then collapse breakdown</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.770" end="00:32:26.950" style="s2">death has always been part of that life</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.610" end="00:32:29.740" style="s2">as a planetary process like that the</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.950" end="00:32:33.159" style="s2">German poet scientists greater said more</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.740" end="00:32:36.159" style="s2">than two hundred years ago and that</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.159" end="00:32:40.210" style="s2">death is life&#39;s ingenious way of</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.159" end="00:32:43.029" style="s2">creating plenty of life and and to some</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.210" end="00:32:47.679" style="s2">extent Joanna Macy put it in it in this</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.029" end="00:32:50.529" style="s2">wonderful term of saying um we have a</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.679" end="00:32:54.429" style="s2">dual role where were hospice workers to</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.529" end="00:32:56.649" style="s2">a dying system and midwives of a system</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.429" end="00:32:58.470" style="s2">that wants to be born yeah hospice</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.649" end="00:33:03.730" style="s2">workers of the industrial growth society</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.470" end="00:33:11.860" style="s2">and midwives of the life-sustaining or</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.730" end="00:33:17.280" style="s2">generative culture future and so I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.860" end="00:33:22.480" style="s2">the jury is still out of whether we can</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.280" end="00:33:25.690" style="s2">even reverse global warming by doing the</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.480" end="00:33:29.950" style="s2">right actions at the right scale geo</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.690" end="00:33:33.610" style="s2">therapy not geoengineering and to draw</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.950" end="00:33:36.730" style="s2">down vast amounts of carbon into soils</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.610" end="00:33:40.720" style="s2">standing forests for functional wetlands</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.730" end="00:33:42.850" style="s2">and mangroves and begin to heal the</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.720" end="00:33:48.910" style="s2">damage that we&#39;ve done over 5,000 years</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.850" end="00:33:52.540" style="s2">and I think that the pathway towards</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.910" end="00:33:55.150" style="s2">doing that is exactly the same pathway</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.540" end="00:33:55.840" style="s2">as the pathway when you said okay what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.150" end="00:34:00.960" style="s2">the other option</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.840" end="00:34:00.960" style="s2">it&#39;s too late we&#39;re running into a</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.200" end="00:34:06.160" style="s2">future where basically over 300 300 400</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.330" end="00:34:09.190" style="s2">years we just know it&#39;s always gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.160" end="00:34:16.150" style="s2">worse and and there&#39;s a few generations</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.190" end="00:34:19.630" style="s2">left to live out our species on on on on</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.150" end="00:34:22.600" style="s2">a system that is in meltdown if we were</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.630" end="00:34:25.030" style="s2">to prepare for that future the wisest</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.600" end="00:34:29.500" style="s2">way of doing that would also be to come</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.030" end="00:34:32.860" style="s2">back to place to region to refit how we</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.500" end="00:34:37.000" style="s2">meet our needs to the unique conditions</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.860" end="00:34:39.490" style="s2">of the bio regions we we live in and to</p>

<p begin="00:34:39.490" end="00:34:45.160" style="s2">wherever possible to diversify our local</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.730" end="00:34:48.730" style="s2">economies in on ways that we basically</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.160" end="00:34:52.960" style="s2">have the resilience that we can meet</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.730" end="00:34:56.650" style="s2">most of the coordinates in the bio</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.960" end="00:34:58.840" style="s2">region but in ways that are aimed at</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.650" end="00:35:01.360" style="s2">healing and making the bio region as</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.840" end="00:35:03.880" style="s2">resilient as possible so it is also</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.360" end="00:35:07.290" style="s2">about reforesting and shifting towards</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.880" end="00:35:09.970" style="s2">the biomaterials economy and and a</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.290" end="00:35:12.100" style="s2">circle like circular biomaterials</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.970" end="00:35:13.420" style="s2">economy shifting away from materials</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.100" end="00:35:15.610" style="s2">that come out of the ground that need</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.420" end="00:35:17.100" style="s2">high amounts of energy to be pulled out</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.610" end="00:35:19.530" style="s2">all all these</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.100" end="00:35:21.600" style="s2">kind of things if we prepare on the</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.530" end="00:35:23.640" style="s2">ground if we make sure that we build</p>

<p begin="00:35:33.240" end="00:35:39.600" style="s2">less so differently but I think these</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.080" end="00:35:43.200" style="s2">two paths are actually converging so in</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.600" end="00:35:48.750" style="s2">in the sense that the more people we get</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.200" end="00:35:51.600" style="s2">on the path of healing their region Co</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.750" end="00:35:53.340" style="s2">creatively having the conversation of</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.600" end="00:35:55.380" style="s2">what would a regenerative culture in</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.340" end="00:35:58.290" style="s2">this place looked like what did this</p>

<p begin="00:35:58.290" end="00:36:05.160" style="s2">but also combining ancient wisdom with</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.490" end="00:36:08.220" style="s2">modern technology in a way that finds</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.160" end="00:36:12.600" style="s2">that potential of a both/and rather than</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.220" end="00:36:16.680" style="s2">an either/or and so that for me is like</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.600" end="00:36:21.030" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s defeatist to say that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.680" end="00:36:23.430" style="s2">definitely had it I think we there is</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.030" end="00:36:28.770" style="s2">still a real chance to make a difference</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.430" end="00:36:31.320" style="s2">and at the same time we need to embrace</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.770" end="00:36:34.190" style="s2">collapse as because so much of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.320" end="00:36:36.960" style="s2">collapse we will see around us is the</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.190" end="00:36:38.910" style="s2">collapse of patterns and processes that</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.960" end="00:36:42.090" style="s2">are dysfunctional and no longer work</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.910" end="00:36:44.250" style="s2">it&#39;s the dissolution of rigidity and it</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.090" end="00:36:46.980" style="s2">happens the same way in in ecosystems</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.250" end="00:36:49.890" style="s2">like the climax ecosystem isn&#39;t as</p>

<p begin="00:37:37.680" end="00:37:40.860" style="s2">years things are probably gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.120" end="00:37:42.810" style="s2">worse we have gonna see more storms</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.860" end="00:37:44.940" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna see because there&#39;s a lag in</p>

<p begin="00:37:46.740" end="00:37:50.370" style="s2">gonna see more collapse and that then</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.840" end="00:37:51.930" style="s2">needs a level of maturity of</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.370" end="00:37:54.750" style="s2">understanding that this work is</p>

<p begin="00:37:54.750" end="00:37:59.850" style="s2">like a secular building work we started</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.060" end="00:38:02.910" style="s2">maybe the next generation finishes it if</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.850" end="00:38:04.500" style="s2">we do it well the next three decades are</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.910" end="00:38:08.490" style="s2">gonna be a tough ride no matter what</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.500" end="00:38:10.650" style="s2">because we left too late but to say the</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.490" end="00:38:12.510" style="s2">next three decades are just riding it</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.650" end="00:38:15.120" style="s2">out and it&#39;s definitely gonna go to</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.510" end="00:38:17.090" style="s2">shit&#39;s afterwards I think it&#39;s mistaken</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.120" end="00:38:19.830" style="s2">tour and and I think that this</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.090" end="00:38:21.600" style="s2">unfortunately a few we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.830" end="00:38:24.900" style="s2">about ego trips is that there&#39;s a few</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.600" end="00:38:26.760" style="s2">people that because it&#39;s sort of prop</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.900" end="00:38:28.320" style="s2">being a profit of doing immediately</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.760" end="00:38:30.930" style="s2">gives you a share lots of attention and</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.320" end="00:38:34.470" style="s2">and I find that&#39;s really dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.930" end="00:38:36.930" style="s2">like I like I&#39;m all for eepa adaptation</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.470" end="00:38:40.020" style="s2">and but it&#39;s been misunderstood by a lot</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.930" end="00:38:41.760" style="s2">of people as it&#39;s all over and prepare</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.020" end="00:38:43.650" style="s2">for the massive collapse and and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.760" end="00:38:47.280" style="s2">bit more nuanced than that some</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.650" end="00:38:50.670" style="s2">collapses and some like breakdowns and</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.280" end="00:38:52.320" style="s2">breakthroughs at the same time mmm it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.670" end="00:38:55.710" style="s2">such a great way of framing it like that</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.320" end="00:38:58.200" style="s2">for me it fills me with like I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.710" end="00:39:00.300" style="s2">heard it explained or put like that in a</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.200" end="00:39:03.660" style="s2">way because I feel like I&#39;m interacting</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.300" end="00:39:04.290" style="s2">with a lot of people where that it is it</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.660" end="00:39:07.080" style="s2">is doomed</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.290" end="00:39:11.660" style="s2">it is gloom but to him you put it in</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.080" end="00:39:14.850" style="s2">that way I feel not a sense of hope like</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.660" end="00:39:18.180" style="s2">blind hope but like ah there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.850" end="00:39:19.860" style="s2">more here it&#39;s a more long-term story</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.180" end="00:39:23.100" style="s2">we&#39;re playing rather than this short</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.860" end="00:39:25.230" style="s2">term we need these demands met in this</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.100" end="00:39:27.670" style="s2">amount of time we need we also need a</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.230" end="00:39:29.580" style="s2">longevity towards that work</p>

<p begin="00:39:29.580" end="00:39:37.320" style="s2">add another nuance to this and because</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.350" end="00:39:40.010" style="s2">it is also like about understanding the</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.320" end="00:39:42.170" style="s2">difference between doing and being</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.010" end="00:39:47.180" style="s2">and I mean this might sound really</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.170" end="00:39:49.760" style="s2">philosophical but ultimately I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.180" end="00:39:52.760" style="s2">always reminded for me this was today</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.760" end="00:39:56.330" style="s2">it just speaks to that and you know the</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.760" end="00:39:59.780" style="s2">wonderful work Joanna Macy has done in</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.330" end="00:40:02.300" style="s2">translating Lukas poems and there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.780" end="00:40:03.740" style="s2">beautiful poem that I wrote almost 100</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.300" end="00:40:05.690" style="s2">years ago</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.740" end="00:40:08.060" style="s2">dear darkening ground where he was</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.690" end="00:40:13.670" style="s2">basically speaking about this time and</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.060" end="00:40:16.040" style="s2">and and at the end of that poem he asks</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.670" end="00:40:18.590" style="s2">give me just a little more time give me</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.040" end="00:40:20.990" style="s2">just a little more time so I may love</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.590" end="00:40:24.740" style="s2">the things until they&#39;re real and ripe</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.990" end="00:40:27.250" style="s2">and worthy of you and and that&#39;s a shift</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.740" end="00:40:31.280" style="s2">in being that&#39;s a shift in understanding</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.250" end="00:40:33.290" style="s2">that the way that we can hold the</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.280" end="00:40:36.200" style="s2">uncertainty of whether we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.290" end="00:40:39.020" style="s2">make it the actual fact that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.200" end="00:40:41.170" style="s2">have that certainty is what&#39;s cooking us</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.020" end="00:40:45.880" style="s2">to the point that we are actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.170" end="00:40:48.680" style="s2">transforming as beings it is a</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.880" end="00:40:50.350" style="s2">species-level rite of passage by</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.680" end="00:40:53.660" style="s2">confronting the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.350" end="00:40:57.440" style="s2">extinction at the species level we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.660" end="00:41:00.200" style="s2">now pushed each individually to take a</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.440" end="00:41:02.240" style="s2">step of maturation and ask how do we</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.200" end="00:41:04.940" style="s2">become mature members in the community</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.240" end="00:41:08.210" style="s2">of life how do we serve life rather than</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.940" end="00:41:10.250" style="s2">let life serve us and understand that in</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.210" end="00:41:14.660" style="s2">serving life we serve ourselves because</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.250" end="00:41:18.080" style="s2">we are live and and and that is a being</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.660" end="00:41:19.970" style="s2">change that ultimately says it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.080" end="00:41:23.750" style="s2">matter whether we&#39;re gonna make it or</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.970" end="00:41:26.450" style="s2">not it matters how we go out if we go</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.750" end="00:41:29.420" style="s2">out and it matters how we go forward if</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.450" end="00:41:32.450" style="s2">we go forward and that&#39;s about coming</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.420" end="00:41:33.740" style="s2">back to the gift that is just this</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.450" end="00:41:36.500" style="s2">conversation that we&#39;re having here</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.740" end="00:41:40.010" style="s2">right now like being in relationship is</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.500" end="00:41:43.570" style="s2">what life is all about and and so the</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.010" end="00:41:46.520" style="s2">minute we act from that state of being</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.570" end="00:41:49.640" style="s2">where we&#39;re actually not attached to</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.520" end="00:41:51.500" style="s2">outcomes and we love the fact that we</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.640" end="00:41:53.430" style="s2">get the opportunity to be here and</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.500" end="00:41:56.440" style="s2">respond</p>

<p begin="00:42:00.280" end="00:42:06.670" style="s2">at the same time is answering the</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.150" end="00:42:10.270" style="s2">question why are we worth it we begin to</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.670" end="00:42:12.360" style="s2">realize that we are life&#39;s way of</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.270" end="00:42:15.700" style="s2">experiencing self I mean of course it</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.360" end="00:42:18.400" style="s2">sequoia tree or penguin also is life&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.700" end="00:42:20.410" style="s2">way of experiencing itself but but the</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.400" end="00:42:23.320" style="s2">level of human consciousness that can</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.410" end="00:42:27.550" style="s2">put the love for a forest into a song</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.320" end="00:42:30.220" style="s2">and that all the things that can risk</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.550" end="00:42:32.620" style="s2">your life direct nonviolent direct</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.220" end="00:42:35.380" style="s2">actions they&#39;re all the beautiful images</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.620" end="00:42:38.220" style="s2">of X are where people have found that</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.380" end="00:42:41.620" style="s2">strength that courage to step up and act</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.220" end="00:42:44.170" style="s2">from a power that is beyond their</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.620" end="00:42:45.520" style="s2">individual because again Joanna Macy</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.170" end="00:42:47.290" style="s2">said this to me at one point she said</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.520" end="00:42:52.300" style="s2">think Daniel when you do these actions</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.290" end="00:42:54.700" style="s2">do them with the authority of 3.8</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.300" end="00:42:56.830" style="s2">billion years of life&#39;s evolution when</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.700" end="00:42:59.440" style="s2">you stand on that stage and you tell</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.830" end="00:43:01.840" style="s2">people it&#39;s not Daniel Valle talking in</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.440" end="00:43:05.080" style="s2">your ego blah blah blah it&#39;s life</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.840" end="00:43:07.150" style="s2">speaking to life and if we come from</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.080" end="00:43:08.950" style="s2">that place then then it&#39;s it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.150" end="00:43:15.220" style="s2">different that&#39;s that&#39;s where the</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.950" end="00:43:22.000" style="s2">regeneration happens yeah I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.220" end="00:43:24.940" style="s2">feeling the like thank you well so I had</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.000" end="00:43:26.320" style="s2">a couple of questions that were I was</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.940" end="00:43:32.640" style="s2">trying I was basically trying to put</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.320" end="00:43:35.260" style="s2">myself in the shoes of people that</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.640" end="00:43:39.100" style="s2">they&#39;re a variety of different people so</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.260" end="00:43:42.580" style="s2">say like the old person that is not so</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.100" end="00:43:44.080" style="s2">mobile or and is just starting to find</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.580" end="00:43:46.150" style="s2">out these about these issues and doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.080" end="00:43:47.680" style="s2">have a community around them or the the</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.150" end="00:43:49.660" style="s2">single mother that&#39;s living in a tower</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.680" end="00:43:51.100" style="s2">block that&#39;s like working pretty</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.660" end="00:43:52.930" style="s2">intensely in order to look after her</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.100" end="00:43:56.650" style="s2">family I was trying to put myself in</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.930" end="00:43:58.810" style="s2">those different shoes and think like</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.650" end="00:44:00.670" style="s2">what would those people ask an expert</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.810" end="00:44:02.980" style="s2">about regenerative cultures like what</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.670" end="00:44:04.800" style="s2">would what would they want to know so</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.980" end="00:44:07.809" style="s2">I&#39;ve got a couple of questions that are</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.800" end="00:44:10.940" style="s2">specifically from that</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.809" end="00:44:12.890" style="s2">so I was imagining it like if I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.940" end="00:44:14.900" style="s2">to help support my local community to</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.890" end="00:44:16.640" style="s2">become more regenerative and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.900" end="00:44:18.559" style="s2">sure how to start or to do that in a way</p>

<p begin="00:44:18.559" end="00:44:24.530" style="s2">differences what would you do in a</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.869" end="00:44:27.770" style="s2">situation like that what what advice</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.530" end="00:44:29.150" style="s2">would you give well first I really have</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.770" end="00:44:34.819" style="s2">to respond okay</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.150" end="00:44:37.369" style="s2">I think we we&#39;re making a mistake by</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.819" end="00:44:39.319" style="s2">repeating the the meme of expert</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.369" end="00:44:44.240" style="s2">cultures like I don&#39;t I don&#39;t see myself</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.319" end="00:44:49.930" style="s2">and as as an expert and well I spend a</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.240" end="00:44:52.220" style="s2">lot of time on that apprenticeship and</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.930" end="00:44:54.500" style="s2">have learned a lot from amazing people</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.220" end="00:44:56.510" style="s2">that that that I can share little</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.500" end="00:45:00.410" style="s2">snippets of insights that other people</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.510" end="00:45:07.040" style="s2">have given me inside myself but but</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.410" end="00:45:09.799" style="s2">really I think that all of us have if we</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.040" end="00:45:13.819" style="s2">and it&#39;s difficult I mean this is that</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.799" end="00:45:15.650" style="s2">for me personally something really big</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.819" end="00:45:17.660" style="s2">happened when my daughter was born in</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.650" end="00:45:21.230" style="s2">the last like she&#39;s not two and a half</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.660" end="00:45:26.420" style="s2">years old and I kind of realized only</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.230" end="00:45:28.490" style="s2">through her how somewhat arrogant I had</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.420" end="00:45:31.670" style="s2">become in my own privilege with every</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.490" end="00:45:33.500" style="s2">education that I&#39;ve had and all the the</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.670" end="00:45:35.839" style="s2">privilege of having been able to live my</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.500" end="00:45:41.030" style="s2">life the way of lived ISM and do all</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.839" end="00:45:42.980" style="s2">this and um and it was quite judgmental</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.030" end="00:45:44.900" style="s2">of Joe Bloggs like sometimes I would sit</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.980" end="00:45:48.190" style="s2">in on a bus and I&#39;d hear people talk</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.900" end="00:45:48.190" style="s2">about whatever the current</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.119" end="00:45:57.220" style="s2">binge-watching telenovela whatever was</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.520" end="00:46:00.349" style="s2">on like I live in Spain and yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.220" end="00:46:03.770" style="s2">since I become a father I realize how</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.349" end="00:46:06.589" style="s2">easy it is to be in the treadmill of</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.770" end="00:46:09.559" style="s2">this degenerative system that that that</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.589" end="00:46:11.690" style="s2">is still active out there and when you</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.559" end="00:46:15.589" style="s2">look okay with all the love that you</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.690" end="00:46:17.450" style="s2">look at your children the priority that</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.589" end="00:46:18.740" style="s2">they&#39;re fed in in school and that</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.450" end="00:46:21.650" style="s2">they&#39;re well and</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.740" end="00:46:25.250" style="s2">between the dynamics of partnership and</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.650" end="00:46:28.130" style="s2">friends and families around that life</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.250" end="00:46:31.609" style="s2">can very quickly swallow you up in a way</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.130" end="00:46:33.980" style="s2">that to point at people and say we</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.609" end="00:46:36.500" style="s2">should be doing more for the saving the</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.980" end="00:46:41.750" style="s2">planet is a bit arrogant</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.500" end="00:46:45.410" style="s2">and and and and so but at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.750" end="00:46:47.750" style="s2">I do feel that that we all simply by by</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.410" end="00:46:49.849" style="s2">having the quack at the conversations</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.750" end="00:46:52.310" style="s2">it&#39;s the conversation with some other</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.849" end="00:46:55.849" style="s2">mothers while you&#39;re waiting for it to</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.310" end="00:46:58.790" style="s2">come out of school or to just ask these</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.849" end="00:47:00.920" style="s2">questions that there are about how could</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.790" end="00:47:03.500" style="s2">we live differently and see all these</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.920" end="00:47:05.900" style="s2">people in the street can we can we not</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.500" end="00:47:07.820" style="s2">what is it that we can do about it maybe</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.900" end="00:47:09.109" style="s2">we should ask the school to do a bit</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.820" end="00:47:13.339" style="s2">more with the parents they need to</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.109" end="00:47:18.460" style="s2">respond to us and and and to also be</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.339" end="00:47:22.220" style="s2">aware that I that no matter how tight</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.460" end="00:47:26.839" style="s2">the financial situation is every time we</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.220" end="00:47:28.550" style="s2">spend into this economic system we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.839" end="00:47:30.109" style="s2">driving Italy even if we spend</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.550" end="00:47:32.480" style="s2">positively if we try to be good</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.109" end="00:47:34.040" style="s2">consumers and buy the right products and</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.480" end="00:47:36.710" style="s2">stuff we&#39;re still because they&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.040" end="00:47:38.720" style="s2">money system is in itself degenerative</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.710" end="00:47:41.119" style="s2">and that we that&#39;s another story we need</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.720" end="00:47:44.270" style="s2">to somehow change that as well but but</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.119" end="00:47:45.619" style="s2">we still have a choice like consumer</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.270" end="00:47:50.619" style="s2">cooperatives are popping up everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.619" end="00:47:55.250" style="s2">that make local organic food affordable</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.619" end="00:47:57.830" style="s2">and and even make it the entry point</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.250" end="00:48:01.910" style="s2">into that conversation like just saying</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.830" end="00:48:05.240" style="s2">I want to do more and and say how do I</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.910" end="00:48:08.089" style="s2">do that and to bring a few other people</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.240" end="00:48:10.640" style="s2">together and say how do we pool our</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.089" end="00:48:13.250" style="s2">resources so we can buy a local organic</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.640" end="00:48:15.320" style="s2">food can we find a farmer or because</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.250" end="00:48:17.300" style="s2">they almost and now they&#39;re community</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.320" end="00:48:19.040" style="s2">supported agriculture systems popping up</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.300" end="00:48:21.050" style="s2">and if you don&#39;t have the money to pay</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.040" end="00:48:22.730" style="s2">the whole ledge box you can you can you</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.050" end="00:48:25.970" style="s2">can come on a Sunday with your family</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.730" end="00:48:29.839" style="s2">and and do some some farming so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.970" end="00:48:32.510" style="s2">it&#39;s basically because what&#39;s coming is</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.839" end="00:48:35.240" style="s2">going to be a bit of a rocky ride</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.510" end="00:48:38.210" style="s2">coming back to community is the most</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.240" end="00:48:41.030" style="s2">important thing and to find others and</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.210" end="00:48:45.910" style="s2">engage with them in conversation and I</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.030" end="00:48:49.369" style="s2">think that children food and health a</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.910" end="00:48:51.170" style="s2">wonderful entry points to that nested</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.369" end="00:48:52.760" style="s2">wholeness to understanding all the other</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.170" end="00:48:56.450" style="s2">bits like when you come into food you</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.760" end="00:48:57.770" style="s2">understand how it&#39;s linked to your</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.450" end="00:48:59.990" style="s2">personal health how it&#39;s linked to</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.770" end="00:49:02.810" style="s2">ecosystems health where it comes from</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.990" end="00:49:05.690" style="s2">and so easy to from just entering with</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.810" end="00:49:08.810" style="s2">what do we eat at home to completely</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.690" end="00:49:14.450" style="s2">rebuild your entire worldview almost</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.810" end="00:49:17.600" style="s2">when when you understand it amazing</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.450" end="00:49:23.420" style="s2">yeah great way to articulate that and</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.600" end="00:49:25.220" style="s2">really yeah really clear thank you and</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.420" end="00:49:27.800" style="s2">so then I was thinking I was also</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.220" end="00:49:34.220" style="s2">thinking about some of the critiques of</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.800" end="00:49:37.430" style="s2">extra and yeah I was just I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.220" end="00:49:39.140" style="s2">about climate justice and it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.430" end="00:49:41.359" style="s2">important to a lot of people within and</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.140" end="00:49:44.900" style="s2">outside of the movement and you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.359" end="00:49:50.660" style="s2">there&#39;s a critique around Exxon and its</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.900" end="00:49:53.060" style="s2">whiteness and its privilege how my</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.660" end="00:49:56.840" style="s2">regenerative cultures support us or</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.060" end="00:50:02.900" style="s2">support support as I say us as in XR but</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.840" end="00:50:05.210" style="s2">I think us more wired widely to within</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.900" end="00:50:08.330" style="s2">climate justice and within that that</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.210" end="00:50:12.050" style="s2">part of the movement towards a more</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.330" end="00:50:15.200" style="s2">beautiful future that&#39;s a huge one and</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.050" end="00:50:17.720" style="s2">then and again it&#39;s very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.200" end="00:50:21.619" style="s2">because you&#39;ve got an overeducated over</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.720" end="00:50:24.590" style="s2">privileged white guy in the second half</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.619" end="00:50:30.040" style="s2">of his 40s in front with you and so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.590" end="00:50:33.609" style="s2">kind of I&#39;m one of the exact examples of</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.040" end="00:50:36.560" style="s2">what people might be reacting against of</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.609" end="00:50:39.970" style="s2">we need more middle-aged white guys to</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.560" end="00:50:39.970" style="s2">tell us what to do and</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.130" end="00:50:50.820" style="s2">it&#39;s dead there&#39;s a lot of trauma of all</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.530" end="00:50:53.130" style="s2">the people within each culture in each</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.820" end="00:50:56.250" style="s2">country we&#39;ve had like the xenophobia is</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.130" end="00:50:57.869" style="s2">popping up so strongly and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.250" end="00:51:01.320" style="s2">originally from Germany to see that in</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.869" end="00:51:05.190" style="s2">Germany there&#39;s a rise of fascism and</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.320" end="00:51:07.190" style="s2">and neo-nazis again I really thought</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.190" end="00:51:09.810" style="s2">that wasn&#39;t gonna happen again</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.190" end="00:51:12.480" style="s2">we were pretty strongly educated about</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.810" end="00:51:15.510" style="s2">the atrocities that happened in in</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.480" end="00:51:19.230" style="s2">Germany and in before and during the</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.510" end="00:51:21.450" style="s2">Second World War and to see that that</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.230" end="00:51:24.810" style="s2">evil monster is rearing its head all</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.450" end="00:51:27.960" style="s2">over the world and how of course we need</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.810" end="00:51:30.900" style="s2">to stand up to that and um and and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.960" end="00:51:37.080" style="s2">so difficult to still stay in that place</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.900" end="00:51:39.210" style="s2">of not uttering not again out of even</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.080" end="00:51:40.890" style="s2">out of that making a box and not seeing</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.210" end="00:51:44.430" style="s2">these people anymore because that just</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.890" end="00:51:46.710" style="s2">perpetuates the the the process and and</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.430" end="00:51:48.599" style="s2">what I find like recently I had a</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.710" end="00:51:50.490" style="s2">conversation with Joel glance Burke was</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.599" end="00:51:52.520" style="s2">one of the real elders in in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.490" end="00:51:56.760" style="s2">Regenesis Institute in a Genesis group</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.520" end="00:51:58.650" style="s2">kind of carry the lineage of how to use</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.760" end="00:52:01.470" style="s2">regenerative practice to change how</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.650" end="00:52:06.510" style="s2">people think to change the processes</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.470" end="00:52:08.820" style="s2">behind and and he pointed out workers we</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.510" end="00:52:12.119" style="s2">were talking about D colonialization we</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.820" end="00:52:14.640" style="s2">were talking about that even that D like</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.119" end="00:52:17.250" style="s2">D gross D colonialization is again this</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.640" end="00:52:18.230" style="s2">polarizing all the swing in the pendulum</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.250" end="00:52:22.710" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.230" end="00:52:25.170" style="s2">like it&#39;s it&#39;s recalling like our minds</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.710" end="00:52:27.330" style="s2">have been colonialist all our minds the</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.170" end="00:52:28.700" style="s2">white minds as well and one thing that</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.330" end="00:52:32.930" style="s2">he pointed out historically</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.700" end="00:52:36.450" style="s2">which is really interesting is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.930" end="00:52:39.240" style="s2">not as simple as just saying all the</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.450" end="00:52:42.210" style="s2">white guys from Europe were the colonial</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.240" end="00:52:45.650" style="s2">Isis and went everywhere and fucked up</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.210" end="00:52:45.650" style="s2">the planet and and now</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.660" end="00:52:50.250" style="s2">climate change is happening and it was</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.039" end="00:52:53.520" style="s2">mainly those cultures that caused 90% of</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.250" end="00:52:55.410" style="s2">it and it it&#39;s hitting all the the</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.520" end="00:52:58.530" style="s2">cultures that actually had less to do</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.410" end="00:53:00.750" style="s2">with it and many of these cultures and</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.530" end="00:53:04.520" style="s2">that is a fact in history that that</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.750" end="00:53:07.349" style="s2">first we exploited raped and pillaged in</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.520" end="00:53:09.210" style="s2">colonialism then we exploited raped and</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.349" end="00:53:12.140" style="s2">pillaged in neo colonialism with</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.210" end="00:53:15.420" style="s2">neoliberal economics and and</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.140" end="00:53:18.890" style="s2">globalization and now climate change is</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.420" end="00:53:21.450" style="s2">hitting the same places really hard and</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.890" end="00:53:23.369" style="s2">there&#39;s a sort of attitude of oh we lend</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.450" end="00:53:28.140" style="s2">you some money to solve the problems</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.369" end="00:53:32.369" style="s2">mmm that&#39;s crazy but to be mindful of</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.140" end="00:53:35.130" style="s2">the fact that like Joel said this when</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.369" end="00:53:39.109" style="s2">all these Americans like when America</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.130" end="00:53:41.490" style="s2">was colonialist by European settlers a</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.109" end="00:53:45.630" style="s2">vast amount of the people that actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.490" end="00:53:48.930" style="s2">went over there were indentured that</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.630" end="00:53:51.359" style="s2">means that some rich guy brought 50 or</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.930" end="00:53:54.329" style="s2">60 people over paying for that passage</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.359" end="00:53:56.579" style="s2">and then they needed to serve that</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.329" end="00:53:58.260" style="s2">person for seven years in order to pay</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.579" end="00:54:01.559" style="s2">for that patented passage and this was</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.260" end="00:54:04.319" style="s2">at a time where people live generally</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.559" end="00:54:06.569" style="s2">into their early 40s so it was a big</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.319" end="00:54:09.109" style="s2">chunk of their life and what what he was</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.569" end="00:54:12.059" style="s2">trying to point out was that actually</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.109" end="00:54:15.619" style="s2">most of the white guys the trauma of</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.059" end="00:54:18.240" style="s2">being oppressed and being slaves</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.619" end="00:54:20.039" style="s2">happened in the white culture just as</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.240" end="00:54:22.410" style="s2">much they were also slaves and if Hugh</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.039" end="00:54:25.260" style="s2">de l&#39;europe was basically futile slavery</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.410" end="00:54:27.270" style="s2">like there was a land Lordan and so I</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.260" end="00:54:28.950" style="s2">think we need to realize that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.270" end="00:54:30.900" style="s2">as simple of just just because you have</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.950" end="00:54:33.299" style="s2">a different skin color you the oppressed</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.900" end="00:54:34.049" style="s2">and and and if you white you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.299" end="00:54:37.529" style="s2">the oppressor</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.049" end="00:54:39.630" style="s2">and it&#39;s to understand that this pattern</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.529" end="00:54:41.789" style="s2">of oppression and of other ring runs</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.630" end="00:54:46.980" style="s2">through all the cultures and that we</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.789" end="00:54:50.800" style="s2">need to address these issues but by just</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.980" end="00:54:53.440" style="s2">other ring again it</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.800" end="00:54:56.260" style="s2">it&#39;s not going to help resolve it but</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.440" end="00:54:58.180" style="s2">again I&#39;m I&#39;m very aware that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.260" end="00:55:00.340" style="s2">probably triggering a lot of people in</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.180" end="00:55:06.700" style="s2">minority cultures by what I&#39;ve just said</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.340" end="00:55:08.830" style="s2">because um if you&#39;ve been subjected to</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.700" end="00:55:11.410" style="s2">physical violence and psychological</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.830" end="00:55:13.960" style="s2">violence how you look or who you love or</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.410" end="00:55:16.540" style="s2">how about my sexuality is or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.960" end="00:55:18.610" style="s2">and it&#39;s completely understanding that</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.540" end="00:55:20.920" style="s2">you carry so much trauma and so much</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.610" end="00:55:23.920" style="s2">anger that when you say who are you to</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.920" end="00:55:26.290" style="s2">tell me I can&#39;t other this fuckhead my</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.920" end="00:55:28.930" style="s2">girlfriend and just for how she looks or</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.290" end="00:55:32.170" style="s2">something yeah I understand that that</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.930" end="00:55:34.200" style="s2">people hold that energy but but I think</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.170" end="00:55:36.970" style="s2">that for me regenerative cultures is</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.200" end="00:55:39.820" style="s2">also about taking a deep dive into this</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.970" end="00:55:43.240" style="s2">but really listening</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.820" end="00:55:46.480" style="s2">from a place of interbeing from from</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.240" end="00:55:49.090" style="s2">actually feeling the pain of that other</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.480" end="00:55:51.460" style="s2">person deeply inside like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.090" end="00:55:55.140" style="s2">there&#39;s this beautiful beautiful poem by</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.460" end="00:55:59.290" style="s2">tip not han and call me by my true names</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.140" end="00:56:01.180" style="s2">yeah and I you can find it just google</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.290" end="00:56:03.490" style="s2">call me by my true names for kidnet Han</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.180" end="00:56:04.750" style="s2">that for me is the essence that if every</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.490" end="00:56:07.090" style="s2">anybody who wants to have that</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.750" end="00:56:09.750" style="s2">conversation about decolonial izing</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.090" end="00:56:12.540" style="s2">exile and so on</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.750" end="00:56:16.090" style="s2">just put that poem in your pocket</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.540" end="00:56:18.820" style="s2">whenever there&#39;s an argument and you</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.090" end="00:56:20.590" style="s2">feel like like that the energy flows up</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.820" end="00:56:22.900" style="s2">let&#39;s just just right bring the</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.590" end="00:56:25.330" style="s2">mindfulness fell in and read the poem to</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.900" end="00:56:27.490" style="s2">everyone and you to yourself as well and</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.330" end="00:56:31.990" style="s2">it will diffuse that conversation a</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.490" end="00:56:35.950" style="s2">little bit wise words yeah I mean it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.990" end="00:56:39.970" style="s2">really charged subject and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.950" end="00:56:43.450" style="s2">a it&#39;s like there&#39;s a clear there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.970" end="00:56:45.820" style="s2">a plural versity of approaches to it and</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.450" end="00:56:48.369" style="s2">I think yeah it&#39;s great to hear you</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.820" end="00:56:52.480" style="s2">speak on that and speak about the need</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.369" end="00:56:55.990" style="s2">to yeah that needs to find find a way to</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.480" end="00:57:04.120" style="s2">see see the overview and how how do we</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.990" end="00:57:05.440" style="s2">move past that so my final question what</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.120" end="00:57:07.180" style="s2">would be the burning thing that you want</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.440" end="00:57:12.540" style="s2">to say to extinction rebellion like if</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.180" end="00:57:15.730" style="s2">we were all listening which we are what</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.540" end="00:57:17.800" style="s2">but yeah what is the what is the burning</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.730" end="00:57:20.340" style="s2">thing that feels really alive for you</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.800" end="00:57:27.490" style="s2">that you&#39;d like to say 2x huh</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.340" end="00:57:32.400" style="s2">thank you thank you no I seriously I</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.490" end="00:57:37.090" style="s2">mean it and I mean I don&#39;t I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.400" end="00:57:39.540" style="s2">distinguish as much between XR and</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.090" end="00:57:43.180" style="s2">Fridays for future although I know that</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.540" end="00:57:46.240" style="s2">but for me that movement that surging up</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.180" end="00:57:49.120" style="s2">of life like what Paul Hawken call it a</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.240" end="00:57:52.090" style="s2">long time ago a planetary immune</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.120" end="00:57:54.520" style="s2">response and for me something really</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.090" end="00:57:56.920" style="s2">shifted both in the first X our actions</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.520" end="00:57:59.080" style="s2">here in Palma and the first Friday&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.920" end="00:58:01.180" style="s2">a future demonstration to see that</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.080" end="00:58:04.210" style="s2">finally there were so many others of us</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.180" end="00:58:07.030" style="s2">in the street and and speaking up for</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.210" end="00:58:10.060" style="s2">life as life and really touched me</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.030" end="00:58:16.570" style="s2">deeply and and really made me feel</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.060" end="00:58:19.150" style="s2">hopeful that that we&#39;re really now at at</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.570" end="00:58:21.250" style="s2">this point of deep transformation that</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.150" end="00:58:25.240" style="s2">the compost building that has been going</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.250" end="00:58:26.650" style="s2">on for at least 50 years like well right</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.240" end="00:58:29.650" style="s2">now a lot of people talk about all the</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.650" end="00:58:31.480" style="s2">the big corporate you about like the big</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.650" end="00:58:33.940" style="s2">oil companies nearby the land age 50</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.480" end="00:58:35.620" style="s2">years ago of course they did but for 50</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.940" end="00:58:38.500" style="s2">years like I know people who wrote the</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.620" end="00:58:40.540" style="s2">briefing paper to the 1972 conference on</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.500" end="00:58:45.010" style="s2">the environment my second PhD supervisor</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.540" end="00:58:47.850" style="s2">John Todd I remember when I asked him 15</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.010" end="00:58:51.430" style="s2">years ago what was it like back then in</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.850" end="00:58:53.620" style="s2">1972 or when you started the new alchemy</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.430" end="00:58:55.600" style="s2">Institute where the first experiments</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.620" end="00:59:00.790" style="s2">about windmills and and and and all that</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.600" end="00:59:03.940" style="s2">which he came from and he he said well</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.790" end="00:59:05.800" style="s2">back then we were there were 50 60 of us</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.940" end="00:59:10.570" style="s2">and we kind of knew each other by name</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.800" end="00:59:14.140" style="s2">and and now there are millions yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.570" end="00:59:17.770" style="s2">and the jump that has happened just in</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.140" end="00:59:21.340" style="s2">line in 2019 and with</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.770" end="00:59:24.190" style="s2">so many more people being aware of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.340" end="00:59:27.610" style="s2">need for transformative change now but</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.190" end="00:59:36.520" style="s2">but then I would say thank you and I</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.610" end="00:59:43.000" style="s2">would also say um the biggest challenge</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.520" end="00:59:47.130" style="s2">is how do we see the individual human</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.000" end="00:59:50.800" style="s2">being who cares in all those different</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.130" end="00:59:54.100" style="s2">because it&#39;s not just in the grassroots</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.800" end="00:59:56.470" style="s2">movements that that this planetary</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.100" end="00:59:59.080" style="s2">immune response is coming up there are</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.470" end="01:00:02.320" style="s2">actually people in the large corporates</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.080" end="01:00:04.660" style="s2">who have the same life speaking and</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.320" end="01:00:06.220" style="s2">moving in them and wanting to make a</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.660" end="01:00:08.080" style="s2">difference they and their mindsets their</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.220" end="01:00:11.260" style="s2">and their friends mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.080" end="01:00:14.230" style="s2">but there are people in the we mean</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.260" end="01:00:16.330" style="s2">business Alliance the B team that</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.230" end="01:00:18.640" style="s2">Richard Branson put together and yes of</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.330" end="01:00:21.970" style="s2">course it&#39;s obscene how inequality and</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.640" end="01:00:23.860" style="s2">how rich he is and all that but em how</p>

<p begin="01:00:23.860" end="01:00:29.200" style="s2">I find it really frustrating this wrong</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.410" end="01:00:31.840" style="s2">kind of green movements that that just</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.200" end="01:00:34.180" style="s2">shoots down the conversation about the</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.840" end="01:00:38.500" style="s2">new Green Deal and all of that and and</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.180" end="01:00:40.270" style="s2">immediately like all the kind of people</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.500" end="01:00:41.920" style="s2">who are still trapped in the technology</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.270" end="01:00:43.540" style="s2">will ride over the hill and save us</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.920" end="01:00:45.640" style="s2">story there are lots of people who are</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.540" end="01:00:49.600" style="s2">actually working on pretty useful things</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.640" end="01:00:53.560" style="s2">for the transition like it&#39;s not quite</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.600" end="01:00:56.470" style="s2">so clean cut to to actually keep seeing</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.560" end="01:00:58.690" style="s2">the positive in these impulses and</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.470" end="01:01:00.510" style="s2">trying to engage them because if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.690" end="01:01:04.000" style="s2">understanding that we&#39;re all kind of</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.510" end="01:01:07.420" style="s2">from our limited perspectives all half</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.000" end="01:01:09.160" style="s2">right and half wrong and trying to do</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.420" end="01:01:11.080" style="s2">something about it and start walking in</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.160" end="01:01:13.600" style="s2">the same direction that higher ground</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.080" end="01:01:16.330" style="s2">together it&#39;s so much easier to then</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.600" end="01:01:17.980" style="s2">have the conversation you still don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.330" end="01:01:20.290" style="s2">get it there&#39;s something wrong with the</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.980" end="01:01:22.840" style="s2">capitalist system as we have it right</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.290" end="01:01:25.000" style="s2">now but then to maybe have the skillful</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.840" end="01:01:27.490" style="s2">means of say saying let&#39;s not big devil</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.000" end="01:01:29.740" style="s2">everybody who uses the word capital and</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.490" end="01:01:32.170" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.740" end="01:01:35.050" style="s2">reclaim that and refrain that and and</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.170" end="01:01:39.730" style="s2">work with that energy so this it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.050" end="01:01:42.250" style="s2">a long way of saying um please be super</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.730" end="01:01:44.740" style="s2">mindful of not creating an other and</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.250" end="01:01:48.420" style="s2">they did then of course the world is</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.740" end="01:01:50.560" style="s2">uttering X are like this were being</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.420" end="01:01:53.050" style="s2">radicals or being the even almost</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.560" end="01:01:55.600" style="s2">declared terrorists and all this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.050" end="01:01:58.119" style="s2">stuff but but that&#39;s that&#39;s the deep</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.600" end="01:02:00.550" style="s2">practice the deeper level of non-violent</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.119" end="01:02:03.400" style="s2">direct action in a truly Gandhi and kind</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.550" end="01:02:07.540" style="s2">of way is not to get triggered by that</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.400" end="01:02:09.040" style="s2">and and not to respond with all your</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.540" end="01:02:12.520" style="s2">other amel and I&#39;ll give you a bit of</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.040" end="01:02:15.310" style="s2">other but to actually keep keep open</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.520" end="01:02:18.490" style="s2">keep in dialogue and and really shift</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.310" end="01:02:22.840" style="s2">from it&#39;s all going to shits and we have</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.490" end="01:02:27.119" style="s2">a extinction as the first word rebellion</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.840" end="01:02:29.619" style="s2">to saying be to avoid extinction we need</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.119" end="01:02:32.290" style="s2">because that&#39;s what you&#39;re saying yeah</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.619" end="01:02:34.450" style="s2">and if we co-create regenerate have</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.290" end="01:02:37.300" style="s2">contracted everywhere then we won&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.450" end="01:02:39.280" style="s2">as much extinction as if you don&#39;t yeah</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.300" end="01:02:43.750" style="s2">we&#39;re still committed unfortunately to</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.280" end="01:02:46.840" style="s2">lots of species disappearing um but</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.750" end="01:02:49.180" style="s2">we&#39;re also capable of of slowing that</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.840" end="01:02:54.040" style="s2">down drastically and and improving and</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.180" end="01:02:55.690" style="s2">vast amount of land and oceans and</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.040" end="01:02:58.660" style="s2">that&#39;s exciting</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.690" end="01:03:00.670" style="s2">yeah I think it&#39;s that getting excited</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.660" end="01:03:03.960" style="s2">about the positive bit that we we are</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.670" end="01:03:08.670" style="s2">the generation that that is called to</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.960" end="01:03:11.020" style="s2">transform the human impact on earth and</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.670" end="01:03:14.530" style="s2">the only way to do it is to do it</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.020" end="01:03:20.800" style="s2">together and not to keep chumming</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.530" end="01:03:22.590" style="s2">manatee to bits so like there&#39;s so many</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.800" end="01:03:27.820" style="s2">things that you&#39;ve said that feel like</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.590" end="01:03:29.920" style="s2">for me are keys and unlocking new</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.820" end="01:03:32.290" style="s2">understanding and new possibilities it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.920" end="01:03:35.490" style="s2">lots for me to go away and think about</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.290" end="01:03:37.960" style="s2">and I&#39;m excited to figure out how I</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.490" end="01:03:43.310" style="s2">write this up and translate what you</p>
