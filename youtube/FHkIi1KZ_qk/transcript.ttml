<p begin="00:01:12.799" end="00:01:16.960" style="s2">we are concerned with the same problems</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.560" end="00:01:20.560" style="s2">and trying to work within academia</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.960" end="00:01:23.920" style="s2">to bridge it with</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.560" end="00:01:26.400" style="s2">worlds contemplative spiritual types of</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.920" end="00:01:28.720" style="s2">of worlds and practices that maybe don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:01:30.479" end="00:01:34.960" style="s2">are being made</p>

<p begin="00:02:00.719" end="00:02:03.920" style="s2">influenced by whitehead or who adopt a</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.719" end="00:02:07.920" style="s2">broadly process</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.920" end="00:02:09.840" style="s2">oriented view i&#39;m teaching a course this</p>

<p begin="00:02:16.640" end="00:02:22.000" style="s2">dewey um</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.760" end="00:02:23.760" style="s2">and purse very important for me as well</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.000" end="00:02:25.280" style="s2">but uh as an undergrad i studied</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.760" end="00:02:28.400" style="s2">cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.280" end="00:02:31.599" style="s2">at university of central florida</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.400" end="00:02:34.640" style="s2">with professors like mason cash</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.599" end="00:02:36.480" style="s2">and sean gallagher and gallagher studied</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.640" end="00:02:40.000" style="s2">with francisco varela</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.480" end="00:02:42.000" style="s2">was colleagues with him and so i got</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.000" end="00:02:43.200" style="s2">into philosophy of mind and cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.000" end="00:02:45.519" style="s2">science but then</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.200" end="00:02:47.440" style="s2">you know sean gallagher introduced me to</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.519" end="00:02:50.480" style="s2">phenomenology and varela&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.440" end="00:02:52.800" style="s2">and evan thompson and yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.480" end="00:02:54.160" style="s2">the significance of phenomenology for</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.800" end="00:02:56.640" style="s2">understanding</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.160" end="00:02:59.040" style="s2">the mind there&#39;s a there&#39;s a what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.640" end="00:03:01.200" style="s2">called a cognitivist paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.040" end="00:03:03.599" style="s2">um and a computationalist paradigm that</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.200" end="00:03:06.000" style="s2">looks at the mind in one way and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.599" end="00:03:07.760" style="s2">that&#39;s what i was you know the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.000" end="00:03:09.280" style="s2">science department at ucf was mainly</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.760" end="00:03:10.640" style="s2">focused there but sean gallagher was</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.280" end="00:03:11.200" style="s2">bringing this other phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.640" end="00:03:14.640" style="s2">direction</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.200" end="00:03:16.239" style="s2">right i was very interested in that and</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.640" end="00:03:18.319" style="s2">started reading who cyril and marilu</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.239" end="00:03:20.480" style="s2">ponti and varela&#39;s work and</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.319" end="00:03:22.080" style="s2">evan thompson&#39;s work and learning about</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.480" end="00:03:27.519" style="s2">the inactive perspective</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.080" end="00:03:29.840" style="s2">which um i think can easily be</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.519" end="00:03:30.720" style="s2">i think it&#39;s it&#39;s helpful when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.840" end="00:03:34.080" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.720" end="00:03:35.840" style="s2">cognitive science and epistemology and</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.080" end="00:03:37.840" style="s2">when we&#39;re trying to understand the</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.840" end="00:03:40.720" style="s2">biological basis of mind</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.840" end="00:03:42.879" style="s2">but what interested me about an activism</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.720" end="00:03:45.120" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.879" end="00:03:46.879" style="s2">was how does it deal with ontological</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.120" end="00:03:50.000" style="s2">and cosmological questions</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.879" end="00:03:51.920" style="s2">right right and there&#39;s not much really</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.000" end="00:03:53.360" style="s2">within the inactivist paradigm about</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.920" end="00:03:55.120" style="s2">those questions</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.360" end="00:03:57.760" style="s2">um it&#39;s more like they&#39;re bracketed</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.120" end="00:04:00.319" style="s2">which is a typical phenomenological move</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.760" end="00:04:01.920" style="s2">and so i got interested more in</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.319" end="00:04:04.319" style="s2">whitehead because i was like oh</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.920" end="00:04:05.599" style="s2">here&#39;s the cosmology and the ontology</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.319" end="00:04:07.599" style="s2">maybe that</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.599" end="00:04:09.280" style="s2">makes synthetic places at the inactivist</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.599" end="00:04:13.439" style="s2">paradigm and autopoetic</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.280" end="00:04:14.480" style="s2">biology in a grounded it grounds it onto</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.439" end="00:04:17.600" style="s2">logically</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.480" end="00:04:21.040" style="s2">it&#39;s like process ontology provides for</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.600" end="00:04:22.320" style="s2">um the missing ontology in an activism</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.040" end="00:04:24.240" style="s2">and i&#39;ve been talking to evan thompson</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.320" end="00:04:27.520" style="s2">about this for a while and</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.240" end="00:04:29.280" style="s2">he&#39;s slowly but surely i think</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.520" end="00:04:31.280" style="s2">moving towards a more white hedian</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.280" end="00:04:32.000" style="s2">perspective oh it&#39;d be great if the</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.280" end="00:04:34.240" style="s2">three of us</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.000" end="00:04:35.919" style="s2">spoke i mean evan&#39;s a colleague and</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.240" end="00:04:36.880" style="s2">friend of mine and it would be great for</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.919" end="00:04:38.800" style="s2">the three of us</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.880" end="00:04:40.160" style="s2">uh to speak together sometime we should</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.800" end="00:04:41.520" style="s2">probably try and set that up that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.160" end="00:04:43.759" style="s2">like a really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.520" end="00:04:45.040" style="s2">triangle for discussion i would love</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.759" end="00:04:47.440" style="s2">that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.040" end="00:04:49.440" style="s2">um but so you know whitehead was has</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.440" end="00:04:52.400" style="s2">been really influential for me but also</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.440" end="00:04:54.320" style="s2">um jorge ferreira is a colleague of mine</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.400" end="00:04:55.680" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.320" end="00:04:57.759" style="s2">i would like to meet him by the way</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.680" end="00:05:00.320" style="s2">that&#39;s another uh trial log we could do</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.759" end="00:05:01.520" style="s2">yes that sounds fantastic um he&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.320" end="00:05:04.160" style="s2">spain right now</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.520" end="00:05:04.880" style="s2">because cis has been virtualized he</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.160" end="00:05:07.680" style="s2">teach he</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.880" end="00:05:10.080" style="s2">he teaches online anyway so but uh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.680" end="00:05:13.840" style="s2">his participatory theory</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.080" end="00:05:16.960" style="s2">and participatory study or approach to</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.840" end="00:05:18.560" style="s2">religion and spirituality uh allowed me</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.960" end="00:05:20.960" style="s2">to see how</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.560" end="00:05:22.840" style="s2">there&#39;s a different way of getting at</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.960" end="00:05:24.560" style="s2">the science religion or science</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.840" end="00:05:27.600" style="s2">spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.560" end="00:05:28.800" style="s2">um culture war that that doesn&#39;t require</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.600" end="00:05:31.440" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.800" end="00:05:32.080" style="s2">a they be at war or even b that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.440" end="00:05:34.000" style="s2">sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.080" end="00:05:35.120" style="s2">non-overlapping magisteria or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.000" end="00:05:36.840" style="s2">but that actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.120" end="00:05:38.639" style="s2">at a deeper level there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.840" end="00:05:42.320" style="s2">participatory</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.639" end="00:05:42.880" style="s2">way of knowing that is essential for</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.320" end="00:05:46.000" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.880" end="00:05:48.320" style="s2">and also for for religion yes and</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.000" end="00:05:49.840" style="s2">we get into more dogmatic forms of</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.320" end="00:05:51.280" style="s2">either materialism or</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.840" end="00:05:53.840" style="s2">some kind of creationism or</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.280" end="00:05:56.479" style="s2">fundamentalism when we stop</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.840" end="00:05:58.080" style="s2">consciously um when we&#39;re when we when</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.479" end="00:06:00.240" style="s2">we lose conscious awareness of that</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.080" end="00:06:05.520" style="s2">participatory dimension of our knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.240" end="00:06:07.440" style="s2">yeah yeah so these that&#39;s sort of the uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.520" end="00:06:08.880" style="s2">my influence is where i&#39;m coming from</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.440" end="00:06:10.639" style="s2">and um</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.880" end="00:06:12.960" style="s2">clearly you know we have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.639" end="00:06:15.680" style="s2">overlaps and i guess</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.960" end="00:06:17.440" style="s2">you know i uh what i would love to talk</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.680" end="00:06:18.319" style="s2">to you about and whatever else you want</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.440" end="00:06:21.360" style="s2">to talk about it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.319" end="00:06:23.600" style="s2">great too is um</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.360" end="00:06:24.880" style="s2">what you think about these the the the</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.600" end="00:06:26.880" style="s2">cosmological</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.880" end="00:06:28.479" style="s2">and ontological questions and</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.880" end="00:06:30.319" style="s2">metaphysical questions</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.479" end="00:06:32.479" style="s2">that uh from an activist or</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.319" end="00:06:35.120" style="s2">participatory perspective</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.479" end="00:06:36.720" style="s2">um do we need to say more say as an</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.120" end="00:06:38.800" style="s2">activist do we need to say more about</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.720" end="00:06:41.840" style="s2">the cosmological</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.800" end="00:06:44.400" style="s2">backdrop or context of um</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.840" end="00:06:47.280" style="s2">of this approach that&#39;s very good i was</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.400" end="00:06:50.560" style="s2">just talking to jordan hall about this</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.280" end="00:06:52.960" style="s2">we were talking about um you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.560" end="00:06:54.080" style="s2">a reinventio i i&#39;ve taken this term from</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.960" end="00:06:56.000" style="s2">kerry who did a</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.080" end="00:06:57.280" style="s2">really wonderful book on augustine&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.000" end="00:06:58.639" style="s2">invention of the inner cell</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.280" end="00:07:00.560" style="s2">but he said the word he wanted to use</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.639" end="00:07:02.240" style="s2">with the latin word inventio which means</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.560" end="00:07:04.080" style="s2">both to discover and to make</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.240" end="00:07:05.360" style="s2">it stands on that and so we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.080" end="00:07:06.479" style="s2">about sort of the reinvention of</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.360" end="00:07:08.800" style="s2">rationality</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.479" end="00:07:11.360" style="s2">and how once we once we move it out of</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.800" end="00:07:12.160" style="s2">the computational algorithmic cartesian</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.360" end="00:07:14.800" style="s2">paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.160" end="00:07:17.199" style="s2">it starts to move into uh something that</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.800" end="00:07:20.160" style="s2">starts to overlap with virtue ethics and</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.199" end="00:07:20.960" style="s2">with a sense of reverence and um et</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.160" end="00:07:24.240" style="s2">cetera</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.960" end="00:07:25.840" style="s2">and but this this general question uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.240" end="00:07:28.160" style="s2">uh also came up because he made the</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.840" end="00:07:30.000" style="s2">point that there is</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.160" end="00:07:31.520" style="s2">there&#39;s a code there&#39;s a co-definition</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.000" end="00:07:34.160" style="s2">between that</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.520" end="00:07:36.800" style="s2">model of rationality and a model of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.160" end="00:07:38.880" style="s2">world as fundamentally lacking</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.800" end="00:07:39.840" style="s2">um in creativity and he he made the</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.880" end="00:07:41.919" style="s2">criticism he said</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.840" end="00:07:43.599" style="s2">you know the ontology admits this moment</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.919" end="00:07:44.720" style="s2">of absolute creativity at the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.599" end="00:07:48.000" style="s2">and then no</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.720" end="00:07:50.560" style="s2">no no you know no ontological creativity</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.000" end="00:07:52.160" style="s2">for for the rest right and we talked</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.560" end="00:07:52.720" style="s2">about how whitehead sort of bounced off</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.160" end="00:07:54.879" style="s2">of that</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.720" end="00:07:56.960" style="s2">that project because you know ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.879" end="00:07:58.800" style="s2">the failure right uh uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.960" end="00:08:01.039" style="s2">for godelian reasons the failure of that</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.800" end="00:08:03.599" style="s2">whole project and then he turns</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.039" end="00:08:04.080" style="s2">to a metaphysics as you know in which</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.599" end="00:08:06.319" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.080" end="00:08:07.680" style="s2">creativity goes it&#39;s not it&#39;s not you</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.319" end="00:08:08.800" style="s2">have to hear that well you know i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.680" end="00:08:10.400" style="s2">speaking to the</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.800" end="00:08:12.400" style="s2">people watching it&#39;s a much more</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.400" end="00:08:13.199" style="s2">ontological notion than we usually use</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.400" end="00:08:14.800" style="s2">that word</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.199" end="00:08:17.120" style="s2">people hear creativity and think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.800" end="00:08:18.800" style="s2">something like a psychological capacity</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.120" end="00:08:20.560" style="s2">yeah exactly right yeah whitehead meant</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.800" end="00:08:22.720" style="s2">it metaphysically and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.560" end="00:08:24.000" style="s2">it&#39;s impersonal creativity it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.720" end="00:08:28.800" style="s2">creativity of</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.000" end="00:08:31.599" style="s2">of a genius like no not that</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.800" end="00:08:32.959" style="s2">so and i want to explore that with you</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.599" end="00:08:34.719" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.959" end="00:08:36.640" style="s2">uh because i have an abiding interest in</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.719" end="00:08:38.880" style="s2">whitehead um</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.640" end="00:08:39.760" style="s2">and i&#39;ve read a lot of the books i have</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.880" end="00:08:41.519" style="s2">to confess like</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.760" end="00:08:42.880" style="s2">i could not get through process in</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.519" end="00:08:45.440" style="s2">reality it was very</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.880" end="00:08:46.800" style="s2">and i&#39;ve read some pretty tough nuts but</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.440" end="00:08:48.320" style="s2">that that&#39;s a very hard book but i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.800" end="00:08:50.880" style="s2">read a lot of the you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.320" end="00:08:52.480" style="s2">religion in the making and a lot of his</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.880" end="00:08:54.480" style="s2">other work</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.480" end="00:08:56.240" style="s2">so um and you mentioned the religion in</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.480" end="00:08:58.480" style="s2">the making in the video i watched</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.240" end="00:09:00.160" style="s2">but the the thing that get back to</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.480" end="00:09:01.040" style="s2">jordan&#39;s point and to answer your</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.160" end="00:09:04.720" style="s2">question is</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.040" end="00:09:08.720" style="s2">he said but if you shift into</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.720" end="00:09:11.040" style="s2">um an ontology in which there is genuine</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.720" end="00:09:13.440" style="s2">novelty in some sense and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.040" end="00:09:15.920" style="s2">genuine complexification</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.440" end="00:09:17.920" style="s2">in some sense then he says then</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.920" end="00:09:20.560" style="s2">correspondingly that model</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.920" end="00:09:22.160" style="s2">of rationality also has to be given up</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.560" end="00:09:24.160" style="s2">and we were talking about how the two</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.160" end="00:09:25.920" style="s2">things they have to sort of be given up</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.160" end="00:09:27.519" style="s2">in tandem they have to be given up in</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.920" end="00:09:28.399" style="s2">concert like you have to reinvent your</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.519" end="00:09:29.839" style="s2">both</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.399" end="00:09:32.240" style="s2">if you&#39;ll allow me these really</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.839" end="00:09:34.000" style="s2">contested words there&#39;s a reinventing of</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.240" end="00:09:36.560" style="s2">both reality and rationality</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.000" end="00:09:37.279" style="s2">and they have to be reinvented together</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.560" end="00:09:39.040" style="s2">if you</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.279" end="00:09:41.279" style="s2">right and so i think the question you</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.040" end="00:09:43.360" style="s2">posed to me is directly pertinent the</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.279" end="00:09:46.480" style="s2">question is</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.360" end="00:09:47.680" style="s2">does in so far and i would argue that i</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.480" end="00:09:52.160" style="s2">would argue this</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.680" end="00:09:54.959" style="s2">that insofar as 4e cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.160" end="00:09:55.839" style="s2">i think explicitly in in right</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.959" end="00:09:58.399" style="s2">undermines</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.839" end="00:09:59.360" style="s2">the cartesian conception of cognition</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.399" end="00:10:01.279" style="s2">that of course</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.360" end="00:10:03.680" style="s2">strongly entails that it undermines the</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.279" end="00:10:06.399" style="s2">cartesian conception of rationality</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.680" end="00:10:08.240" style="s2">and then correspondingly it is obligated</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.399" end="00:10:09.200" style="s2">to reinvent here the conception of</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.240" end="00:10:12.079" style="s2">reality</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.200" end="00:10:13.200" style="s2">so because i those two have to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.079" end="00:10:15.519" style="s2">reconfigured</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.200" end="00:10:17.360" style="s2">in a coordinated fashion so i think your</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.519" end="00:10:18.000" style="s2">question is directly pertinent and</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.360" end="00:10:20.800" style="s2">relevant</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.000" end="00:10:21.680" style="s2">i think i think there&#39;s some i i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.800" end="00:10:22.720" style="s2">want i want to make it sound like a</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.680" end="00:10:24.240" style="s2">moral obligation</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.720" end="00:10:26.320" style="s2">but there&#39;s at least an epistemic</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.240" end="00:10:28.480" style="s2">obligation on people</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.320" end="00:10:29.600" style="s2">in four e cog side i sometimes stick</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.480" end="00:10:31.680" style="s2">into 50</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.600" end="00:10:33.519" style="s2">but because i i think the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.680" end="00:10:36.560" style="s2">exactation are really important but</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.519" end="00:10:39.279" style="s2">whatever for e cog sir i think there is</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.560" end="00:10:39.600" style="s2">an epistemic obligation on them uh to</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.279" end="00:10:42.079" style="s2">get</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.600" end="00:10:43.519" style="s2">into the ontology and there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.079" end="00:10:45.360" style="s2">historical precedent</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.519" end="00:10:47.040" style="s2">i mean so dreyfus is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.360" end="00:10:48.959" style="s2">godfather figures</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.040" end="00:10:50.640" style="s2">of four e cognizant and he comes out of</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.959" end="00:10:54.000" style="s2">the heideggerian tradition</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.640" end="00:10:55.760" style="s2">explicitly directly repeatedly and of</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.000" end="00:10:56.959" style="s2">course hattier&#39;s project</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.760" end="00:11:00.240" style="s2">is the project of extending</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.959" end="00:11:03.279" style="s2">phenomenology into fundamental ontology</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.240" end="00:11:05.279" style="s2">and so i for both historical reasons</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.279" end="00:11:06.720" style="s2">and epistemic reasons i think your</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.279" end="00:11:09.760" style="s2">question is directly</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.720" end="00:11:12.959" style="s2">directly pertinent and it is a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.760" end="00:11:14.800" style="s2">you know it&#39;s a bit of i don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.959" end="00:11:18.640" style="s2">call it a question a concern</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.800" end="00:11:21.120" style="s2">why more people haven&#39;t taken that up uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.640" end="00:11:21.920" style="s2">and so i&#39;d be very happy for the reasons</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.120" end="00:11:23.920" style="s2">i&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.920" end="00:11:25.680" style="s2">reviewed to talk to you about this i</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.920" end="00:11:28.720" style="s2">think i think that question is</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.680" end="00:11:31.680" style="s2">very strongly motivated</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.720" end="00:11:32.160" style="s2">yeah um that&#39;s wonderful i love what</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.680" end="00:11:34.480" style="s2">you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.160" end="00:11:36.079" style="s2">and framing this in terms of uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.480" end="00:11:37.600" style="s2">reinventing</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.079" end="00:11:39.519" style="s2">the relationship between reality and</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.600" end="00:11:43.120" style="s2">reason or how we conceive of these two</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.519" end="00:11:46.880" style="s2">and yes exactly that uh the</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.120" end="00:11:49.680" style="s2">4ea or inactive just short</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.880" end="00:11:51.760" style="s2">critique of cartesian rationality and</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.680" end="00:11:53.680" style="s2">the cartesian conception of mind</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.760" end="00:11:55.200" style="s2">strongly implies that the cartesian</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.680" end="00:11:56.720" style="s2">conception of matter</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.200" end="00:11:58.399" style="s2">that&#39;s based on that conception of mind</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.720" end="00:12:01.920" style="s2">also has to go exactly</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.399" end="00:12:04.560" style="s2">exactly and once you do that um</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.920" end="00:12:05.279" style="s2">you know there are places in if so</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.560" end="00:12:07.360" style="s2">varela</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.279" end="00:12:10.560" style="s2">wrote a paper i think it was the last</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.360" end="00:12:13.040" style="s2">one he published with andres weber um</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.560" end="00:12:14.639" style="s2">life after kant oh it happened right</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.040" end="00:12:16.560" style="s2">there i haven&#39;t read that</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.639" end="00:12:18.639" style="s2">oh it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a i think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.560" end="00:12:21.200" style="s2">crucial paper he</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.639" end="00:12:22.240" style="s2">begins by by uh quoting whitehead at the</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.200" end="00:12:23.600" style="s2">beginning</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.240" end="00:12:25.519" style="s2">um something about a conflict of</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.600" end="00:12:27.200" style="s2">doctrines is an opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.519" end="00:12:29.120" style="s2">and uh and he goes on to use some</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.200" end="00:12:29.839" style="s2">whitehead language about the subject</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.120" end="00:12:31.760" style="s2">poll</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.839" end="00:12:33.279" style="s2">that emerges in the context of an</p>

<p begin="00:12:41.040" end="00:12:44.720" style="s2">um and and varela ends up arguing that</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.440" end="00:12:47.839" style="s2">um our conception</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.720" end="00:12:49.680" style="s2">of at least living matter and</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.839" end="00:12:51.200" style="s2">again the paper is titled life after</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.680" end="00:12:54.480" style="s2">kant so he&#39;s engaging with</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.200" end="00:12:58.480" style="s2">kant&#39;s critique of judgment and</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.480" end="00:13:00.480" style="s2">the study of uh teleology in</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.480" end="00:13:02.079" style="s2">self-organ what kant uses the term</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.480" end="00:13:05.600" style="s2">self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.079" end="00:13:08.560" style="s2">beings and varela ends up saying</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.600" end="00:13:09.920" style="s2">look this type of self-organization</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.560" end="00:13:11.519" style="s2">associated with life cannot be</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.920" end="00:13:14.720" style="s2">understood mechanistically</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.519" end="00:13:16.720" style="s2">and it is purposeful it&#39;s a form of</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.720" end="00:13:18.880" style="s2">imminent teleology and kant is also</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.720" end="00:13:22.399" style="s2">making all these distinctions already</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.880" end="00:13:24.079" style="s2">um in 1790 but varela is going back to</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.399" end="00:13:25.839" style="s2">kant and saying look he was right we</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.079" end="00:13:27.920" style="s2">can&#39;t understand this mechanistically</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.839" end="00:13:29.839" style="s2">and he&#39;s he just hints that we probably</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.920" end="00:13:32.560" style="s2">need a new ontology</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.839" end="00:13:34.880" style="s2">uh a new understanding of what nature is</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.560" end="00:13:36.480" style="s2">in order to make sense of this</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.880" end="00:13:38.639" style="s2">in his you know merely ponte was saying</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.480" end="00:13:39.199" style="s2">this too in the in the 60s right before</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.639" end="00:13:41.839" style="s2">he died</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.199" end="00:13:43.040" style="s2">drawing on whitehead drawing on bergson</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.839" end="00:13:46.399" style="s2">drawing on</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.040" end="00:13:47.680" style="s2">shelling and so we need a new conception</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.399" end="00:13:49.760" style="s2">of matter</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.680" end="00:13:51.839" style="s2">and physics already kind of gave it to</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.760" end="00:13:54.959" style="s2">us they call it energy</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.839" end="00:13:56.880" style="s2">but but energy if we just let</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.959" end="00:13:59.120" style="s2">physics tell us about energy it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.880" end="00:14:00.320" style="s2">mathematical equations and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.120" end="00:14:02.320" style="s2">what is what are these what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.320" end="00:14:04.720" style="s2">content of these equations right</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.320" end="00:14:05.600" style="s2">right because it&#39;s otherwise it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.720" end="00:14:07.199" style="s2">strange</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.600" end="00:14:09.279" style="s2">it&#39;s the strange idealism of</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.199" end="00:14:10.480" style="s2">contemporary physics where it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.279" end="00:14:13.040" style="s2">ultimately it all rests on these</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.480" end="00:14:15.440" style="s2">mathematical equations</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.040" end="00:14:17.120" style="s2">formulas yeah and the white hat&#39;s point</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.440" end="00:14:19.120" style="s2">is like what did these form what is the</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.120" end="00:14:23.440" style="s2">content of them and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.120" end="00:14:26.320" style="s2">he says you know energy vectors are um</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.440" end="00:14:26.800" style="s2">he calls them feeling vectors and</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.320" end="00:14:29.760" style="s2">there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.800" end="00:14:30.560" style="s2">primitive form of he calls it prehension</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.760" end="00:14:33.600" style="s2">yep</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.560" end="00:14:35.360" style="s2">it goes on even at the quantum level</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.600" end="00:14:37.199" style="s2">um and that he thinks that new</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.360" end="00:14:40.160" style="s2">conception of what matter is or what</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.199" end="00:14:42.560" style="s2">energy is allows us to understand</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.160" end="00:14:43.839" style="s2">the emergence of everything else that</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.560" end="00:14:46.000" style="s2">came in the course of evolution</p>

<p begin="00:14:57.360" end="00:15:01.600" style="s2">it makes sense in the context of a</p>

<p begin="00:15:04.880" end="00:15:08.959" style="s2">the old material that descartes defined</p>

<p begin="00:15:15.600" end="00:15:18.639" style="s2">you can&#39;t explain the emergence of</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.120" end="00:15:20.800" style="s2">consciousness i would argue</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.639" end="00:15:22.079" style="s2">if you if you keep that old ontology of</p>

<p begin="00:15:22.079" end="00:15:26.079" style="s2">and the whole inactive paradigm and</p>

<p begin="00:15:26.079" end="00:15:30.959" style="s2">marily ponti seems to be um</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.040" end="00:15:34.480" style="s2">there was heidegger was less inclined to</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.040" end="00:15:37.120" style="s2">engage with the sciences</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.480" end="00:15:38.320" style="s2">but merely ponti was more inclined and</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.120" end="00:15:40.000" style="s2">obviously the inactivists are more</p>

<p begin="00:15:44.560" end="00:15:47.759" style="s2">that for me doesn&#39;t go far enough</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.040" end="00:15:49.839" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:16:04.959" end="00:16:08.399" style="s2">uh i mean obviously materialists dismiss</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.199" end="00:16:10.399" style="s2">that but i think a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:16:10.399" end="00:16:12.800" style="s2">him that&#39;s too much of a speculative</p>

<p begin="00:16:19.519" end="00:16:22.639" style="s2">know we have lots of measurements that</p>

<p begin="00:16:26.000" end="00:16:32.800" style="s2">because you know um</p>

<p begin="00:16:36.959" end="00:16:42.560" style="s2">say cosmology is always endocosmology</p>

<p begin="00:17:15.360" end="00:17:19.360" style="s2">argumentatively we reason better</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.760" end="00:17:21.760" style="s2">in distributed cognition rather than a</p>

<p begin="00:17:21.760" end="00:17:25.120" style="s2">that&#39;s something that feels sort of</p>

<p begin="00:17:25.120" end="00:17:32.000" style="s2">um but let let&#39;s let&#39;s let&#39;s i mean</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.559" end="00:17:34.080" style="s2">i would want to anyway because i i have</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.000" end="00:17:37.600" style="s2">so much respect and affection for evan</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.080" end="00:17:37.600" style="s2">um let&#39;s give him his view</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.160" end="00:17:41.280" style="s2">in the sense of let&#39;s say for many</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.799" end="00:17:44.160" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.280" end="00:17:46.080" style="s2">he he and you know and evan is not some</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.160" end="00:17:46.799" style="s2">hand-fisted physical list or anything</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.080" end="00:17:49.679" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.799" end="00:17:50.960" style="s2">right so sensitive reflective deeply</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.679" end="00:17:52.880" style="s2">insightful thoughtful guy</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.960" end="00:17:54.400" style="s2">so he represents you know at least a</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.880" end="00:17:55.919" style="s2">prima facie response</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.400" end="00:17:57.679" style="s2">to the white hitting move i&#39;m not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.919" end="00:18:01.280" style="s2">say we&#39;re gonna end up there</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.679" end="00:18:03.120" style="s2">but but can i suggest one thing because</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.280" end="00:18:04.799" style="s2">there is there was there&#39;s one group of</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.120" end="00:18:07.919" style="s2">thinkers that i think</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.799" end="00:18:10.960" style="s2">do do the ontological move um</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.919" end="00:18:12.480" style="s2">and so the pivotal figure for that</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.960" end="00:18:13.919" style="s2">and she&#39;s not given enough credit i</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.480" end="00:18:15.520" style="s2">think is i don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve read</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.919" end="00:18:18.000" style="s2">alicia guerrero&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.520" end="00:18:19.360" style="s2">in my actions i&#39;m familiar with it but i</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.000" end="00:18:21.440" style="s2">haven&#39;t read it yet no</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.360" end="00:18:22.720" style="s2">yeah and so i mean she starts from the</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.440" end="00:18:25.120" style="s2">same point you just started from when</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.720" end="00:18:27.200" style="s2">the varela</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.120" end="00:18:29.360" style="s2">webber is i think it&#39;s weber because</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.200" end="00:18:32.400" style="s2">he&#39;s german but ah okay varela and</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.360" end="00:18:33.840" style="s2">uh weber okay uh namely kant and the the</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.400" end="00:18:36.799" style="s2">problem of you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.840" end="00:18:39.360" style="s2">uh the the tree and the self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.799" end="00:18:41.120" style="s2">of the organism and what euro argues</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.360" end="00:18:42.960" style="s2">is that we have to actually make an</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.120" end="00:18:44.160" style="s2">ontological revision</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.960" end="00:18:46.400" style="s2">and there and there are two kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.160" end="00:18:48.320" style="s2">significant ones she proposes</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.400" end="00:18:50.480" style="s2">and the reason why i&#39;m putting this up</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.320" end="00:18:52.559" style="s2">is that i see evan</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.480" end="00:18:55.200" style="s2">sort of committed to at least something</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.559" end="00:18:57.200" style="s2">like this and that might give us a way</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.200" end="00:18:59.440" style="s2">of building some common ground so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.200" end="00:19:04.799" style="s2">a suggestion i have</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.440" end="00:19:07.919" style="s2">and so um you know gerardo talks about</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.799" end="00:19:10.000" style="s2">and you know and this is and this is and</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.919" end="00:19:11.039" style="s2">this isn&#39;t just ontology because she</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.000" end="00:19:13.440" style="s2">points out it&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.039" end="00:19:14.240" style="s2">presupposed when we try and explain</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.440" end="00:19:16.640" style="s2">action</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.240" end="00:19:17.520" style="s2">including cognitive action she makes a</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.640" end="00:19:20.880" style="s2">distinction</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.520" end="00:19:24.080" style="s2">between causes and constraints and she</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.880" end="00:19:26.400" style="s2">introduces this notion of constraint as</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.080" end="00:19:28.880" style="s2">something already being used but not</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.400" end="00:19:30.960" style="s2">explicated within existing science and</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.880" end="00:19:34.160" style="s2">then she argues that it can be</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.960" end="00:19:35.760" style="s2">fruitfully re-understood as a bringing</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.160" end="00:19:38.880" style="s2">back into ontology</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.760" end="00:19:42.400" style="s2">of aristotle&#39;s notion of formal cause</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.880" end="00:19:44.080" style="s2">right um yeah but then she did</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.400" end="00:19:45.840" style="s2">i just want to say briefly what&#39;s funny</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.080" end="00:19:47.360" style="s2">is i haven&#39;t read her book but i&#39;ve read</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.840" end="00:19:48.000" style="s2">terrence deacon&#39;s book and he was</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.360" end="00:19:50.240" style="s2">accused</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.000" end="00:19:52.080" style="s2">accused of kind of lifting some ideas</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.240" end="00:19:53.760" style="s2">without yeah with with</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.080" end="00:19:55.600" style="s2">evidence i&#39;ve seen some of the slides</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.760" end="00:19:57.120" style="s2">yeah so i&#39;m familiar with your terms</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.600" end="00:20:00.559" style="s2">that you&#39;re describing because</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.120" end="00:20:02.400" style="s2">i&#39;ve read his book yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.559" end="00:20:04.640" style="s2">i don&#39;t know what to know about to do</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.400" end="00:20:08.559" style="s2">about deacon i mean</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.640" end="00:20:10.159" style="s2">yeah i mean when she sent out that email</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.559" end="00:20:10.799" style="s2">where he said i you know i&#39;ve never met</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.159" end="00:20:13.520" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.799" end="00:20:15.360" style="s2">and she&#39;s got him and her talking and</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.520" end="00:20:16.000" style="s2">the slide from her presentation is</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.360" end="00:20:18.000" style="s2">behind</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.000" end="00:20:20.000" style="s2">the two of them and it&#39;s got some of</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.000" end="00:20:23.520" style="s2">this terminology on it it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.000" end="00:20:25.360" style="s2">wow so yeah uh but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.520" end="00:20:26.559" style="s2">you know let&#39;s let&#39;s put aside academic</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.360" end="00:20:29.840" style="s2">gossip that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.559" end="00:20:30.400" style="s2">i focus on on guerrero because i think</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.840" end="00:20:34.240" style="s2">he</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.400" end="00:20:37.520" style="s2">overwhelmingly has precedence um so</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.240" end="00:20:40.960" style="s2">and the the difference is also</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.520" end="00:20:41.360" style="s2">she she does something that&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.960" end="00:20:42.880" style="s2">bit</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.360" end="00:20:44.880" style="s2">although she&#39;s invokes aristotle&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.880" end="00:20:45.919" style="s2">formal cause she also seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.880" end="00:20:47.600" style="s2">challenging</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.919" end="00:20:49.679" style="s2">now this is something i&#39;m we&#39;re drawing</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.600" end="00:20:52.640" style="s2">from her then it couldn&#39;t give you like</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.679" end="00:20:53.200" style="s2">a sentence that explicitly says this but</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.640" end="00:20:56.400" style="s2">this is</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.200" end="00:20:59.919" style="s2">the notion of real possibility</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.400" end="00:21:02.240" style="s2">which against right and the the</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.919" end="00:21:03.520" style="s2">uh and and this is this is something we</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.240" end="00:21:04.559" style="s2">might want to talk about with respect to</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.520" end="00:21:06.559" style="s2">whitehead because this is an</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.559" end="00:21:08.240" style="s2">area where i&#39;m sort of you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.559" end="00:21:12.240" style="s2">wrestling with whitehead a bit</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.240" end="00:21:12.960" style="s2">but uraro argues that uh the west has</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.240" end="00:21:14.880" style="s2">privilege</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.960" end="00:21:16.240" style="s2">has privileged actuality over</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.880" end="00:21:19.520" style="s2">possibility</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.240" end="00:21:20.480" style="s2">and has rendered actuality as virtually</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.520" end="00:21:22.880" style="s2">synonymous</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.480" end="00:21:23.760" style="s2">with reality um and then this is very</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.880" end="00:21:26.080" style="s2">problematic</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.760" end="00:21:27.039" style="s2">uh because the the science the practice</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.080" end="00:21:29.760" style="s2">of the science</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.039" end="00:21:30.159" style="s2">actually presupposes real possibility</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.760" end="00:21:32.640" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.159" end="00:21:33.600" style="s2">clear example you know conservation of</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.640" end="00:21:35.919" style="s2">energy</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.600" end="00:21:36.960" style="s2">uh requires that potential energy is a</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.919" end="00:21:38.960" style="s2">real thing</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.960" end="00:21:40.159" style="s2">right because the conservation that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.960" end="00:21:42.000" style="s2">the only way you can preserve the con</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.159" end="00:21:43.440" style="s2">it can&#39;t be that it&#39;s only an abstract</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.000" end="00:21:45.120" style="s2">thing it has to be a real thing</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.440" end="00:21:47.120" style="s2">or else the conservation is not really</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.120" end="00:21:48.640" style="s2">happening etc and so you have those</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.120" end="00:21:51.520" style="s2">kinds of arguments</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.640" end="00:21:52.320" style="s2">and so for to my mind whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.520" end="00:21:54.159" style="s2">she&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.320" end="00:21:56.640" style="s2">that&#39;s another thing but what i see here</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.159" end="00:21:58.880" style="s2">doing is i see her trying to</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.640" end="00:21:59.679" style="s2">argue from science and from cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.880" end="00:22:01.679" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.679" end="00:22:03.919" style="s2">from especially from an active cognitive</p>

<p begin="00:22:12.320" end="00:22:16.640" style="s2">the cartesian notion of matter is bound</p>

<p begin="00:22:50.799" end="00:22:55.120" style="s2">he didn&#39;t you know his model of nature</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.799" end="00:22:57.200" style="s2">has extended mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.120" end="00:22:59.120" style="s2">he was he was kind of saying look i</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.200" end="00:23:00.480" style="s2">don&#39;t know how god does it</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.120" end="00:23:02.240" style="s2">that&#39;d be blasphemous for me to claim to</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.480" end="00:23:03.840" style="s2">know how god does it but we can use the</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.240" end="00:23:08.240" style="s2">mathematics that god gave us</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.840" end="00:23:09.840" style="s2">to describe it this way you know and</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.240" end="00:23:11.919" style="s2">as science advanced from that point</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.840" end="00:23:14.080" style="s2">forward they took his analytical tools</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.919" end="00:23:16.880" style="s2">and left the theological move behind</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.080" end="00:23:18.720" style="s2">and and equated the modeling with the</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.880" end="00:23:20.320" style="s2">way nature actually is</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.720" end="00:23:22.400" style="s2">descartes wasn&#39;t saying that&#39;s how it</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.320" end="00:23:25.120" style="s2">actually is he was still and i think</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.400" end="00:23:26.880" style="s2">had a foot in the um the ancient</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.120" end="00:23:30.240" style="s2">tradition of saving the appearances</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.880" end="00:23:33.200" style="s2">but the door to a reduction of</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.240" end="00:23:34.080" style="s2">the human mathematical model to the way</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.200" end="00:23:35.919" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.080" end="00:23:37.440" style="s2">the ontology of the physical world</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.919" end="00:23:39.600" style="s2">actually is</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.440" end="00:23:41.440" style="s2">um because that&#39;s the direction later</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.600" end="00:23:44.799" style="s2">scientists went</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.440" end="00:23:48.320" style="s2">just getting rid of the idea that um</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.799" end="00:23:51.760" style="s2">that actually god and the human</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.320" end="00:23:53.440" style="s2">nature and the human mind are both</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.760" end="00:23:55.279" style="s2">for descartes they&#39;re expressions of god</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.440" end="00:23:56.799" style="s2">i mean there&#39;s one infinite substance</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.279" end="00:23:58.559" style="s2">spinoza was a little clearer on this</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.799" end="00:24:01.440" style="s2">point i think</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.559" end="00:24:02.960" style="s2">so but um anyways there&#39;s a theological</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.440" end="00:24:05.279" style="s2">issue behind the scenes here</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.960" end="00:24:06.080" style="s2">that gets left out of the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.279" end="00:24:09.279" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.080" end="00:24:11.520" style="s2">modern science um and i get why</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.279" end="00:24:13.200" style="s2">but it&#39;s also important when we do start</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.520" end="00:24:14.880" style="s2">to reimagine or reinvent</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.200" end="00:24:17.039" style="s2">the relationship between reason and</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.880" end="00:24:19.760" style="s2">reality that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.039" end="00:24:21.039" style="s2">we don&#39;t we don&#39;t pretend like it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.760" end="00:24:23.200" style="s2">purely secular</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.039" end="00:24:24.400" style="s2">sort of oh i agree i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.200" end="00:24:28.400" style="s2">profoundly right</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.400" end="00:24:28.400" style="s2">i think i mean i think um</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.440" end="00:24:32.159" style="s2">i mean i think the one of the things i</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.039" end="00:24:33.520" style="s2">was talking with jordan about is the</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.159" end="00:24:35.520" style="s2">idea that</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.520" end="00:24:37.760" style="s2">you know the notion when you when you</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.520" end="00:24:39.120" style="s2">moved and here&#39;s where the pragmatists i</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.760" end="00:24:42.000" style="s2">think are helpful</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.120" end="00:24:42.960" style="s2">when you move to a view of reality not</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.000" end="00:24:46.000" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.960" end="00:24:49.440" style="s2">um as fundamentally unchanging but as</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.000" end="00:24:51.039" style="s2">having some genuine novelty creativity</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.440" end="00:24:54.000" style="s2">whatever word we want to put on it</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.039" end="00:24:55.039" style="s2">in its in its fundamental ontology and i</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.000" end="00:24:56.720" style="s2">think there are good arguments for</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.039" end="00:25:00.000" style="s2">making that move by the way</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.720" end="00:25:00.960" style="s2">then your notion of uh of rationality is</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.000" end="00:25:03.520" style="s2">going to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.960" end="00:25:05.679" style="s2">right not one of trying to not not not</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.520" end="00:25:07.919" style="s2">the algorithmic machine that fire</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.679" end="00:25:09.760" style="s2">finds the final fixed picture it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.919" end="00:25:10.480" style="s2">to be like what&#39;s emphasizing james it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.760" end="00:25:13.360" style="s2">going to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.480" end="00:25:14.320" style="s2">right a reliable adductivity to a</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.360" end="00:25:17.679" style="s2">environment</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.320" end="00:25:19.840" style="s2">that is in a fundamental sense changing</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.679" end="00:25:22.000" style="s2">and then if that&#39;s the case then i would</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.840" end="00:25:23.840" style="s2">argue two things come out of that</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.000" end="00:25:25.039" style="s2">give me a second because i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.840" end="00:25:26.720" style="s2">return to your point</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.039" end="00:25:28.400" style="s2">um two things are going to come out of</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.720" end="00:25:29.039" style="s2">that right you&#39;re going to you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.400" end="00:25:31.279" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.039" end="00:25:33.279" style="s2">you&#39;re going to put a premium on</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.279" end="00:25:36.640" style="s2">reliable abilities to</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.279" end="00:25:38.159" style="s2">overcome self-deception and reliable</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.640" end="00:25:39.840" style="s2">abilities to enter into right</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.159" end="00:25:43.200" style="s2">relationship uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.840" end="00:25:45.919" style="s2">with that environment and so i think</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.200" end="00:25:46.320" style="s2">you&#39;re starting to now get into the</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.919" end="00:25:49.760" style="s2">realm</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.320" end="00:25:51.440" style="s2">of virtue properly understood and then a</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.760" end="00:25:52.880" style="s2">virtue that is going to i would argue is</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.440" end="00:25:54.840" style="s2">going to be central to that</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.880" end="00:25:57.919" style="s2">and here i&#39;m making use of woodruff&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.840" end="00:26:00.880" style="s2">idea it is the virtue of reverence</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.919" end="00:26:01.279" style="s2">because reverence is like it&#39;s on the</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.880" end="00:26:03.600" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.279" end="00:26:05.520" style="s2">it cognitively right it has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.600" end="00:26:07.120" style="s2">awe and wonder and insight</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.520" end="00:26:08.720" style="s2">and as a cognitive scientist you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.120" end="00:26:10.400" style="s2">and it&#39;s a psychologist the insight</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.720" end="00:26:10.799" style="s2">machinery is the same machinery by which</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.400" end="00:26:12.880" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.799" end="00:26:14.640" style="s2">realize your own self-deception because</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.880" end="00:26:15.120" style="s2">that&#39;s what really a moment of insight</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.640" end="00:26:16.159" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.120" end="00:26:18.320" style="s2">you&#39;re right you realize that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.159" end="00:26:21.360" style="s2">mis-framed things but</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.320" end="00:26:25.360" style="s2">uh ah is also a</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.360" end="00:26:26.960" style="s2">um is an experience of humiliation</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.360" end="00:26:28.559" style="s2">not in our current senses of the word</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.960" end="00:26:32.000" style="s2">but in the older sense of the word</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.559" end="00:26:33.919" style="s2">the sense that you right you uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.000" end="00:26:35.679" style="s2">have to undergo transformation you have</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.919" end="00:26:37.039" style="s2">to accommodate yourself</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.679" end="00:26:39.360" style="s2">you have to conform yourself to a</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.039" end="00:26:40.400" style="s2">reality that is demanding on you because</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.360" end="00:26:42.480" style="s2">it exceeds</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.400" end="00:26:44.159" style="s2">your grasp in some sense that&#39;s what the</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.480" end="00:26:47.440" style="s2">experience of awe is</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.159" end="00:26:49.360" style="s2">um at least psychologically speaking and</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.440" end="00:26:53.200" style="s2">i think of reverence as</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.360" end="00:26:55.760" style="s2">that virtue that plugs us into</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.200" end="00:26:58.000" style="s2">awe in the right way so that we are</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.760" end="00:27:01.360" style="s2">always</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.000" end="00:27:06.080" style="s2">um we&#39;re reliably virtu</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.360" end="00:27:08.640" style="s2">we&#39;re reliably open to um</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.080" end="00:27:09.600" style="s2">dealing with self-deception and reliably</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.640" end="00:27:12.080" style="s2">open to</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.600" end="00:27:13.200" style="s2">reconforming to a reality that</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.080" end="00:27:16.960" style="s2">continually</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.200" end="00:27:19.200" style="s2">continues to transcend us and so</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.960" end="00:27:20.000" style="s2">the odd thing here and see this is very</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.200" end="00:27:22.960" style="s2">odd is</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.000" end="00:27:25.760" style="s2">that the notion of rationality as sort</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.960" end="00:27:27.600" style="s2">of this aspirational adaptivity</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.760" end="00:27:29.600" style="s2">carries with it a commitment to the</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.600" end="00:27:31.679" style="s2">cultivation of the virtue of reverence</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.600" end="00:27:36.640" style="s2">but then i put it to jordan i said</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.679" end="00:27:38.240" style="s2">but reverence requires a metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.640" end="00:27:40.080" style="s2">right that we&#39;ll call it fourth you</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.240" end="00:27:43.360" style="s2">can&#39;t just if you&#39;re in if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.080" end="00:27:45.440" style="s2">and so the standard world view is not</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.360" end="00:27:47.200" style="s2">one for which people properly</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.440" end="00:27:50.000" style="s2">can experience reverence they&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.200" end="00:27:53.440" style="s2">frank they&#39;ll have fragmented moments</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.000" end="00:27:55.279" style="s2">here and there right and so i think</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.440" end="00:27:56.960" style="s2">if if you&#39;ll allow me to stretch the</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.279" end="00:27:59.279" style="s2">word theology</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.960" end="00:28:00.399" style="s2">i i i&#39;m giving an argument for why i</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.279" end="00:28:04.000" style="s2">think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.399" end="00:28:06.320" style="s2">the if if what we&#39;re talking about is a</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.000" end="00:28:07.520" style="s2">mutual reconceptualization</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.320" end="00:28:10.960" style="s2">reconfiguration</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.520" end="00:28:15.120" style="s2">redesign of rationality</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.960" end="00:28:18.320" style="s2">and reality then that in our ontology</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.120" end="00:28:21.600" style="s2">which can evoke reverence</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.320" end="00:28:24.559" style="s2">is actually central to</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.600" end="00:28:26.399" style="s2">that reconfiguration in a proper fashion</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.559" end="00:28:28.200" style="s2">so i don&#39;t think you can leave</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.399" end="00:28:29.600" style="s2">the theological out of this</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.200" end="00:28:31.679" style="s2">reconfiguration</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.600" end="00:28:33.039" style="s2">for that reason what do you think what</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.679" end="00:28:34.640" style="s2">do you think of that</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.039" end="00:28:36.559" style="s2">i mean i think it&#39;s great i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.640" end="00:28:37.520" style="s2">um very similar to the argument</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.559" end="00:28:38.799" style="s2">whitehead makes</p>

<p begin="00:28:41.279" end="00:28:46.480" style="s2">european science emerges out of a</p>

<p begin="00:28:48.399" end="00:28:54.720" style="s2">has faith in his own</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.000" end="00:28:58.799" style="s2">reason that it is capable of knowing</p>

<p begin="00:29:02.480" end="00:29:05.520" style="s2">science can never get off the ground and</p>

<p begin="00:29:05.520" end="00:29:10.559" style="s2">we can&#39;t prove in advance that nature is</p>

<p begin="00:29:10.559" end="00:29:16.159" style="s2">yeah we have to us we have to assume it</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.399" end="00:29:18.559" style="s2">and then engage as if it were true in</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.159" end="00:29:23.039" style="s2">order to have it confirmed in what we</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.559" end="00:29:26.240" style="s2">discover right um and</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.039" end="00:29:28.720" style="s2">that&#39;s faith you know now we have</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.240" end="00:29:29.840" style="s2">scientific positions i mean they&#39;re i</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.720" end="00:29:30.880" style="s2">would say they&#39;re philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.840" end="00:29:34.159" style="s2">positions but like</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.880" end="00:29:37.679" style="s2">eliminative materialism yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.159" end="00:29:40.960" style="s2">where it&#39;s as if the possibility</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.679" end="00:29:42.720" style="s2">of scientific knowledge isn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.960" end="00:29:44.080" style="s2">something that&#39;s questioned it&#39;s just we</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.720" end="00:29:45.919" style="s2">have scientific knowledge and this is</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.080" end="00:29:47.520" style="s2">what it reveals to us that</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.919" end="00:29:48.960" style="s2">yes there&#39;s just a bunch of matter in</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.520" end="00:29:50.080" style="s2">motion and our brain is just a</p>

<p begin="00:29:50.080" end="00:29:54.799" style="s2">piece of material and we have a word</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.960" end="00:29:56.880" style="s2">like consciousness that</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.799" end="00:29:58.799" style="s2">really just indicates a series of</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.880" end="00:30:01.760" style="s2">behaviors that we follow from</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.799" end="00:30:02.799" style="s2">its utterance or whatever and i think</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.760" end="00:30:04.720" style="s2">that ends you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.799" end="00:30:07.840" style="s2">when you lose the the ground of</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.720" end="00:30:09.600" style="s2">reverence and i&#39;m not you know i&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.840" end="00:30:11.679" style="s2">paul and patricia churchlin have</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.600" end="00:30:12.640" style="s2">reverence you know they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.679" end="00:30:14.799" style="s2">searching for an</p>

<p begin="00:30:16.080" end="00:30:21.600" style="s2">metaphysics and so they&#39;re aware of</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.600" end="00:30:23.200" style="s2">the issue and they want to i&#39;m you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.600" end="00:30:23.679" style="s2">they&#39;re i&#39;m sure they&#39;re virtuous people</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.200" end="00:30:26.080" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.679" end="00:30:26.960" style="s2">i i&#39;m not disputing anybody&#39;s character</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.080" end="00:30:28.080" style="s2">i&#39;m talking about i mean</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.960" end="00:30:30.480" style="s2">i&#39;m talking about the metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.080" end="00:30:32.880" style="s2">framework yeah go ahead exactly likewise</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.480" end="00:30:34.159" style="s2">but um i think the framework has</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.880" end="00:30:37.360" style="s2">implications</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.159" end="00:30:40.640" style="s2">and that you know when we adopt</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.360" end="00:30:44.480" style="s2">a view of the physical universe that</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.640" end="00:30:44.480" style="s2">says it&#39;s a deterministic mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.720" end="00:30:47.360" style="s2">even if we don&#39;t direct you know like</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.000" end="00:30:48.000" style="s2">someone like richard dawkins doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.360" end="00:30:50.399" style="s2">make direct</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.000" end="00:30:52.000" style="s2">claims i mean he he still thinks human</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.399" end="00:30:53.520" style="s2">beings are free we can rebel against our</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.000" end="00:30:56.880" style="s2">selfish genes and</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.520" end="00:31:00.000" style="s2">have morality and have law</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.880" end="00:31:02.240" style="s2">and have politics but metaphysically</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.000" end="00:31:03.919" style="s2">it&#39;s not clear how that&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.240" end="00:31:04.559" style="s2">whitehead calls this the bifurcation of</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.919" end="00:31:07.679" style="s2">nature</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.559" end="00:31:09.840" style="s2">yes yes and i think that that view of</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.679" end="00:31:13.360" style="s2">what the universe is</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.840" end="00:31:14.960" style="s2">has it has psychological implications</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.360" end="00:31:16.320" style="s2">and sociological implications and</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.960" end="00:31:19.840" style="s2">they&#39;re not good</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.320" end="00:31:23.919" style="s2">yes um yeah go ahead on that i</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.840" end="00:31:26.000" style="s2">i i mean i like that um i like like</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.919" end="00:31:27.519" style="s2">i think that line of argument makes</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.000" end="00:31:31.039" style="s2">sense to me</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.519" end="00:31:33.120" style="s2">um so and i mean</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.039" end="00:31:34.799" style="s2">and there is a move within epistemology</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.120" end="00:31:35.279" style="s2">even to bring in you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.799" end="00:31:38.880" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.279" end="00:31:40.240" style="s2">virtue epistemology right that and uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.880" end="00:31:42.240" style="s2">when we&#39;re talking about knowledge we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.240" end="00:31:44.320" style="s2">we&#39;re talking more about a virtuous</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.240" end="00:31:45.519" style="s2">process that puts us into a reliable</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.320" end="00:31:48.559" style="s2">right relationship</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.519" end="00:31:49.200" style="s2">rather than uh you know some sort of you</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.559" end="00:31:51.360" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.200" end="00:31:52.480" style="s2">algorithmic method or something like</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.360" end="00:31:54.640" style="s2">that or</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.480" end="00:31:57.360" style="s2">or something in which we&#39;ve got you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.640" end="00:31:59.679" style="s2">certainty about our propositional claims</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.360" end="00:32:01.039" style="s2">uh again it&#39;s it&#39;s very pragmatic in</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.679" end="00:32:05.200" style="s2">that sense</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.039" end="00:32:07.519" style="s2">so but is there</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.200" end="00:32:07.519" style="s2">i mean</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.440" end="00:32:12.720" style="s2">if if if like so this is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.240" end="00:32:14.720" style="s2">things that</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.720" end="00:32:16.080" style="s2">intrigues me about neoplatonism and why</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.720" end="00:32:18.000" style="s2">i keep returning to it</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.080" end="00:32:19.679" style="s2">and i know that white has white head has</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.000" end="00:32:21.279" style="s2">a long</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.679" end="00:32:23.360" style="s2">a deep association with the platonic</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.279" end="00:32:26.960" style="s2">tradition um</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.360" end="00:32:29.360" style="s2">yeah so is you know because</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.960" end="00:32:30.960" style="s2">i won&#39;t repeat this argument but i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.360" end="00:32:33.360" style="s2">got arguments out there that</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.960" end="00:32:35.360" style="s2">i i think one of the central functions</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.360" end="00:32:37.200" style="s2">maybe the central function of cognition</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.360" end="00:32:39.200" style="s2">at least of our general intelligence is</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.200" end="00:32:40.000" style="s2">a capacity i call relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.200" end="00:32:41.919" style="s2">and how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.000" end="00:32:44.480" style="s2">deeper than the propositional and i</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.919" end="00:32:46.320" style="s2">think uh the metaphysical pull i think</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.480" end="00:32:47.840" style="s2">relevance realization is an affordance</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.320" end="00:32:49.600" style="s2">relationship it&#39;s between</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.840" end="00:32:51.679" style="s2">the organism and the environment but if</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.600" end="00:32:53.840" style="s2">you&#39;ll allow me the metaphysical pull</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.679" end="00:32:55.279" style="s2">the metaphysical correspondent although</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.840" end="00:32:57.360" style="s2">i&#39;m not offering a correspondence theory</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.279" end="00:32:59.440" style="s2">of truth right to</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.360" end="00:33:00.799" style="s2">relevance realization is intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.440" end="00:33:02.720" style="s2">and the neoplatonus</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.799" end="00:33:04.080" style="s2">they sort of they take you know falling</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.720" end="00:33:05.919" style="s2">from promenities they take</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.080" end="00:33:08.080" style="s2">intelligibility as the thing they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.919" end="00:33:09.919" style="s2">going to build their ontology from</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.080" end="00:33:11.360" style="s2">right rather than presupposing it and</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.919" end="00:33:13.200" style="s2">building an ontology</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.360" end="00:33:14.880" style="s2">they do what you just suggested a moment</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.200" end="00:33:16.960" style="s2">ago they asked the question of</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.880" end="00:33:18.799" style="s2">how is science possible and how does</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.960" end="00:33:20.559" style="s2">reality have to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.799" end="00:33:22.559" style="s2">and we keep you and i are dancing around</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.559" end="00:33:26.240" style="s2">this question right</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.559" end="00:33:30.000" style="s2">and so what what occurs to me though is</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.240" end="00:33:30.000" style="s2">you know given what we just said</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.679" end="00:33:35.200" style="s2">one of the things that we&#39;re introducing</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.360" end="00:33:36.880" style="s2">is kind of it was we&#39;re introducing</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.200" end="00:33:39.120" style="s2">something like a dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.880" end="00:33:40.159" style="s2">intelligibility unlike the neoplatonic</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.120" end="00:33:42.640" style="s2">static right</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.159" end="00:33:44.320" style="s2">i mean there&#39;s the emanation and the uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.640" end="00:33:47.440" style="s2">and the return but you know what i mean</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.320" end="00:33:50.080" style="s2">it&#39;s right that being is</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.440" end="00:33:50.799" style="s2">ultimately static now i think yeah go</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.080" end="00:33:52.799" style="s2">ahead</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.799" end="00:33:53.840" style="s2">well i&#39;m just going to turn it as a</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.799" end="00:33:57.200" style="s2">question to you</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.840" end="00:33:59.279" style="s2">um one way i&#39;ve tried and that might be</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.200" end="00:34:01.279" style="s2">a misunderstanding one way i&#39;ve tried to</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.279" end="00:34:04.399" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.279" end="00:34:07.679" style="s2">whitehead is to try</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.399" end="00:34:10.399" style="s2">and get an ontology that accounts for</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.679" end="00:34:11.599" style="s2">a dynamic intelligibility and an</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.399" end="00:34:14.159" style="s2">intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.599" end="00:34:15.359" style="s2">right i&#39;m using it the way he uses it</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.159" end="00:34:17.839" style="s2">right that something</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.359" end="00:34:18.879" style="s2">because you know an ontology that allows</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.839" end="00:34:21.040" style="s2">me to explain</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.879" end="00:34:22.639" style="s2">my experience of the work of art and my</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.040" end="00:34:23.359" style="s2">understanding of the scientific theory</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.639" end="00:34:25.760" style="s2">i&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.359" end="00:34:27.440" style="s2">intelligibility broadly construed that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.760" end="00:34:29.839" style="s2">why i pointed it to you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.440" end="00:34:31.599" style="s2">the fundamental ability of relevance</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.839" end="00:34:34.480" style="s2">realization to make sense</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.599" end="00:34:35.200" style="s2">like you know like evan&#39;s sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.480" end="00:34:38.720" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.200" end="00:34:41.760" style="s2">uh it&#39;s it&#39;s in that family is that a</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.720" end="00:34:44.399" style="s2">is that a fair take on it</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.760" end="00:34:46.320" style="s2">yeah i think so i think so i think</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.399" end="00:34:50.000" style="s2">reading whitehead as a neoplatonist</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.320" end="00:34:52.480" style="s2">is um an essential interpretive</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.000" end="00:34:53.520" style="s2">uh approach to even being able to grasp</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.480" end="00:34:56.800" style="s2">what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.520" end="00:34:58.400" style="s2">trying to say um good good good and but</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.800" end="00:35:01.200" style="s2">he&#39;s not an emanationist</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.400" end="00:35:02.480" style="s2">no no yeah i mean oh this is interesting</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.200" end="00:35:04.400" style="s2">a thing that came up in our</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.480" end="00:35:06.240" style="s2">the dissertation defense that we were</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.400" end="00:35:08.079" style="s2">part of was the</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.240" end="00:35:09.760" style="s2">you brought it up the uh emanationist</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.079" end="00:35:12.960" style="s2">versus emergent</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.760" end="00:35:13.680" style="s2">yeah and that i think i think we were</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.960" end="00:35:15.359" style="s2">all in</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.680" end="00:35:17.599" style="s2">somewhat agreement that there&#39;s a kind</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.359" end="00:35:20.240" style="s2">of um both and going on here</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.599" end="00:35:21.359" style="s2">yes i i that&#39;s why i&#39;m deeply influenced</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.240" end="00:35:25.680" style="s2">by eredina</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.359" end="00:35:28.720" style="s2">because the emergence and the emanation</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.680" end="00:35:29.680" style="s2">and and the model and the theology they</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.720" end="00:35:31.599" style="s2">are completely</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.680" end="00:35:33.280" style="s2">inter-penetrating and into reporting</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.599" end="00:35:35.920" style="s2">sorry i interrupted you but go</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.280" end="00:35:37.839" style="s2">please go that&#39;s fine that&#39;s fine uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.920" end="00:35:41.200" style="s2">what i see whitehead doing is</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.839" end="00:35:43.280" style="s2">um you know the the platinus&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.200" end="00:35:45.359" style="s2">emanationist scheme from you know the</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.280" end="00:35:48.240" style="s2">one through the levels down to matter</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.359" end="00:35:48.240" style="s2">yeah uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.640" end="00:35:52.480" style="s2">on some readings and i think a close</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.880" end="00:35:54.720" style="s2">reading of the ned&#39;s shows that</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.480" end="00:35:56.000" style="s2">platinus already had a sense of this but</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.720" end="00:35:58.240" style="s2">it&#39;s not as though</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.000" end="00:35:59.200" style="s2">this is a dualism between matter and the</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.240" end="00:36:01.599" style="s2">one no</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.200" end="00:36:03.200" style="s2">no um matter strictly speaking doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.599" end="00:36:05.920" style="s2">exist</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.200" end="00:36:08.000" style="s2">but but it&#39;s there as a pull and what</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.920" end="00:36:09.520" style="s2">whitehead allows us to see more clearly</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.000" end="00:36:11.280" style="s2">and again it&#39;s not like this is</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.520" end="00:36:12.160" style="s2">necessarily in conflict with platinus</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.280" end="00:36:16.079" style="s2">it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.160" end="00:36:17.599" style="s2">no no please but but whitehead would say</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.079" end="00:36:19.119" style="s2">i kind of drew it here as you were as</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.599" end="00:36:20.000" style="s2">you were talking you know i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.119" end="00:36:24.160" style="s2">if you can see this</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.000" end="00:36:24.160" style="s2">oh no it&#39;s a green screen</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.960" end="00:36:27.520" style="s2">i think it&#39;s important enough to see the</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.240" end="00:36:29.040" style="s2">graphic i&#39;m just going to turn off my</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.520" end="00:36:32.160" style="s2">background for a second</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.040" end="00:36:35.200" style="s2">so um it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.160" end="00:36:36.960" style="s2">the the yeah the skate where</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.200" end="00:36:39.040" style="s2">you know the one emanates into matter</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.960" end="00:36:42.480" style="s2">but matter is itself</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.040" end="00:36:45.520" style="s2">also um possessed of potential</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.480" end="00:36:46.079" style="s2">yeah yeah and and evolves back towards</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.520" end="00:36:48.079" style="s2">the one</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.079" end="00:36:49.200" style="s2">or or you know emerges back towards the</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.079" end="00:36:51.280" style="s2">one um</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.200" end="00:36:52.640" style="s2">or evolves through a series of emergent</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.280" end="00:36:54.480" style="s2">you know yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.640" end="00:36:56.160" style="s2">the world&#39;s soul intellect and so on</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.480" end="00:36:58.240" style="s2">back to the one and what whitehead is</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.160" end="00:37:01.200" style="s2">saying is that these two poles</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.240" end="00:37:02.560" style="s2">are he he tries to integrate them in a</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.200" end="00:37:04.880" style="s2">conception of</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.560" end="00:37:06.240" style="s2">creativity which is for him it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.880" end="00:37:08.079" style="s2">universal of universals it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.240" end="00:37:10.240" style="s2">ultimate category of his scheme</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.079" end="00:37:12.079" style="s2">right even more ultimate than god god&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.240" end="00:37:16.560" style="s2">a creature of creativity</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.079" end="00:37:18.240" style="s2">right um and so i think uh</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.560" end="00:37:19.680" style="s2">we can we can read whitehead as a</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.240" end="00:37:22.800" style="s2">neoplatonist</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.680" end="00:37:26.320" style="s2">as long as we&#39;re clear that he&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.800" end="00:37:28.079" style="s2">emanationist as platypus</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.320" end="00:37:30.160" style="s2">and he&#39;s also dynamic right and then</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.079" end="00:37:31.760" style="s2">because of the because the creativity</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.160" end="00:37:33.680" style="s2">now that&#39;s where he&#39;s more like arigina</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.760" end="00:37:34.880" style="s2">or right yeah because there are units</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.680" end="00:37:35.280" style="s2">first so that&#39;s a great way of putting</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.880" end="00:37:39.280" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.280" end="00:37:42.720" style="s2">because aerogena sees creation</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.280" end="00:37:45.920" style="s2">as the category that supersedes</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.720" end="00:37:51.440" style="s2">or and also grounds both emanation</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.920" end="00:37:54.800" style="s2">and emergence or emanation and return um</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.440" end="00:37:54.800" style="s2">there&#39;s a deep similarity there</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.280" end="00:38:00.000" style="s2">yeah i think there&#39;s um a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.800" end="00:38:07.200" style="s2">a heterodox lineage that runs through</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.160" end="00:38:08.160" style="s2">western thought yeah um irgina would be</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.200" end="00:38:11.119" style="s2">part of it the the</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.160" end="00:38:12.160" style="s2">you know like amblicus and proplus and</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.119" end="00:38:14.560" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.160" end="00:38:15.920" style="s2">yeah agrippa and then the whole like</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.560" end="00:38:18.240" style="s2">occult tradition</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.920" end="00:38:19.680" style="s2">through the renaissance and um you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.240" end="00:38:22.560" style="s2">descartes was searching for</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.680" end="00:38:24.079" style="s2">the rosicrucians and trying to like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.560" end="00:38:26.079" style="s2">add some dream i mean</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.079" end="00:38:27.200" style="s2">descartes and newton all those guys way</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.079" end="00:38:28.960" style="s2">weirder than</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.200" end="00:38:31.280" style="s2">well then we think they&#39;re yes very much</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.960" end="00:38:35.280" style="s2">scientific origin story makes it seem</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.280" end="00:38:35.280" style="s2">yeah but like you know if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.079" end="00:38:42.400" style="s2">kepler uh he was a galileo</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.119" end="00:38:44.160" style="s2">too they were astrologers newton&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.400" end="00:38:45.680" style="s2">alchemist</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.160" end="00:38:47.359" style="s2">i don&#39;t want to get into the occult</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.680" end="00:38:50.000" style="s2">necessarily but i think</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.359" end="00:38:51.520" style="s2">there&#39;s a way in which um there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.000" end="00:38:53.520" style="s2">heterodox lineage through western</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.520" end="00:38:57.040" style="s2">thought that tends to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.520" end="00:38:59.520" style="s2">uh participatory it tends to be um</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.040" end="00:39:01.119" style="s2">pan psychist in some way or another yes</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.520" end="00:39:01.920" style="s2">um you know in the modern period it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.119" end="00:39:04.000" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.920" end="00:39:06.000" style="s2">you know bruno giordano bruno is part of</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.000" end="00:39:09.599" style="s2">this tradition leibniz is part of this</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.000" end="00:39:12.160" style="s2">uh shelling i think yes um</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.599" end="00:39:13.119" style="s2">and whitehead&#39;s i think in that lineage</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.160" end="00:39:16.160" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.119" end="00:39:17.119" style="s2">yes it&#39;s it&#39;s a rendering that avoids</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.160" end="00:39:20.400" style="s2">some of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.119" end="00:39:21.680" style="s2">typical thought mistakes i think that</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.400" end="00:39:23.839" style="s2">the western</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.680" end="00:39:26.000" style="s2">philosophical tradition tends to get</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.839" end="00:39:29.520" style="s2">criticized for like</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.000" end="00:39:31.359" style="s2">uh dualism or uh this sense of</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.520" end="00:39:34.400" style="s2">disembodied rationality</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.359" end="00:39:35.920" style="s2">or whatever um we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.400" end="00:39:37.200" style="s2">you know western philosophy is complex</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.920" end="00:39:39.359" style="s2">right and there&#39;s i&#39;m just pointing out</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.200" end="00:39:42.720" style="s2">that there&#39;s this other tradition that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.359" end="00:39:45.839" style="s2">um in some ways still ahead of us</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.720" end="00:39:47.440" style="s2">or that we&#39;re inheriting it and you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.839" end="00:39:49.359" style="s2">but not that the cognitive sciences</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.440" end="00:39:52.320" style="s2">aren&#39;t aren&#39;t advancing this</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.359" end="00:39:53.359" style="s2">um domain of inquiry in a in a in an</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.320" end="00:39:54.800" style="s2">exciting way</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.359" end="00:39:56.480" style="s2">i think they haven&#39;t been done before</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.800" end="00:39:58.000" style="s2">yeah but i think you&#39;re right that</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.480" end="00:40:01.200" style="s2">there&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.000" end="00:40:05.040" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to draw out uh connections</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.200" end="00:40:06.400" style="s2">uh because the okay so first of all</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.040" end="00:40:08.560" style="s2">thank you for the agreement</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.400" end="00:40:09.520" style="s2">uh because then that affords me making a</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.560" end="00:40:11.119" style="s2">move which is</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.520" end="00:40:13.119" style="s2">you know tapping into the work of our</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.119" end="00:40:15.440" style="s2">arthur versus lewis who you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.119" end="00:40:17.359" style="s2">he argues that you know the neoplatonic</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.440" end="00:40:18.800" style="s2">tradition is the spiritual cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.359" end="00:40:21.839" style="s2">grammar of the west</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.800" end="00:40:25.520" style="s2">i love that yeah yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.839" end="00:40:27.680" style="s2">and so if if the figure</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.520" end="00:40:28.880" style="s2">of whitehead is somebody whose</p>

<p begin="00:40:28.880" end="00:40:36.319" style="s2">um is giving us a dynamic neoplatonism</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.200" end="00:40:39.520" style="s2">one that will allow us to reconfigure</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.319" end="00:40:42.319" style="s2">uh reinvention uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.520" end="00:40:44.400" style="s2">real reality and reason in a coordinated</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.319" end="00:40:46.800" style="s2">fashion</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.400" end="00:40:48.800" style="s2">it also would afford a way of</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.800" end="00:40:51.599" style="s2">reinventing and recovering</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.800" end="00:40:52.000" style="s2">that spiritual tradition that has been</p>

<p begin="00:40:52.000" end="00:40:55.440" style="s2">through the or the heterodox that you&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:40:55.440" end="00:40:59.040" style="s2">um that the you know a dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.920" end="00:41:01.440" style="s2">neoplatonism</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.040" end="00:41:03.359" style="s2">could be a way of reinventing the</p>

<p begin="00:41:03.359" end="00:41:05.920" style="s2">cultural cognitive grammar of</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.480" end="00:41:07.119" style="s2">spirituality that&#39;s been running through</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.920" end="00:41:09.839" style="s2">the west</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.119" end="00:41:11.359" style="s2">is that because i heard something like</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.839" end="00:41:12.960" style="s2">that i wanted to make sure i wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.359" end="00:41:15.520" style="s2">misreading or reading into you</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.960" end="00:41:16.880" style="s2">i heard that something like that coming</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.520" end="00:41:19.680" style="s2">out of the video</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.880" end="00:41:20.240" style="s2">that you did uh for the future faces of</p>

<p begin="00:41:20.240" end="00:41:23.599" style="s2">i heard something like that is that is</p>

<p begin="00:41:23.599" end="00:41:26.800" style="s2">is that is that definitely because yes</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.160" end="00:41:30.000" style="s2">definitely</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.800" end="00:41:32.160" style="s2">there&#39;s a neoplatonist uh i mean i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.000" end="00:41:33.119" style="s2">my blog is called footnotes to plato you</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.160" end="00:41:34.560" style="s2">know right right</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.119" end="00:41:36.640" style="s2">drawing from whitehead and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.560" end="00:41:37.440" style="s2">definitely where i situate myself but</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.640" end="00:41:39.680" style="s2">there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.440" end="00:41:41.200" style="s2">there&#39;s another typical reading</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.680" end="00:41:42.640" style="s2">misreading of plato i would say that</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.200" end="00:41:44.640" style="s2">imagines him as like</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.640" end="00:41:46.319" style="s2">a duelist and he&#39;s got this ideal world</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.640" end="00:41:49.040" style="s2">up there and then just</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.319" end="00:41:50.000" style="s2">the world of appearances down here and</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.040" end="00:41:52.160" style="s2">it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.000" end="00:41:53.920" style="s2">i don&#39;t think that you can read a</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.160" end="00:41:55.760" style="s2">dialogue like the symposium</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.920" end="00:41:57.520" style="s2">and end up believing that white that</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.760" end="00:41:59.839" style="s2">plato is some kind of a duelist</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.520" end="00:42:02.720" style="s2">yeah i agree with that so there&#39;s we</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.839" end="00:42:06.560" style="s2">need to read plato more carefully</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.720" end="00:42:08.720" style="s2">and i think whitehead and to some extent</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.560" end="00:42:12.720" style="s2">is preserving the notion of platonic</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.720" end="00:42:14.960" style="s2">forms or he calls them eternal objects</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.720" end="00:42:15.920" style="s2">which alongside actual occasions are the</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.960" end="00:42:18.880" style="s2">two most like</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.920" end="00:42:19.599" style="s2">important uh categories in his scheme</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.880" end="00:42:21.200" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.599" end="00:42:22.640" style="s2">one way of thinking of them is eternal</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.200" end="00:42:25.760" style="s2">objects are potentials and</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.640" end="00:42:27.680" style="s2">actual occasions are actualities right</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.760" end="00:42:30.960" style="s2">and concrescence is the growing together</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.680" end="00:42:34.319" style="s2">of both of these two poles of reality</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.960" end="00:42:35.760" style="s2">right whitehead&#39;s use of the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.319" end="00:42:38.079" style="s2">platonic forms is almost</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.760" end="00:42:40.640" style="s2">inverted in the sense that whereas you</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.079" end="00:42:42.839" style="s2">do get the sense in plato</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.640" end="00:42:45.920" style="s2">that the forms have some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.839" end="00:42:47.839" style="s2">preeminence reality</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.920" end="00:42:49.280" style="s2">he&#39;s leaning more in the emanationist</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.839" end="00:42:50.319" style="s2">direction in that sense whereas</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.280" end="00:42:53.440" style="s2">whitehead is saying</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.319" end="00:42:56.480" style="s2">the forms are he says deficient</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.440" end="00:42:58.560" style="s2">in actuality and that he has</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.480" end="00:43:01.200" style="s2">an ontological principle which for him</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.560" end="00:43:03.200" style="s2">says that outside of actual occasions</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.200" end="00:43:04.720" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing the only reason for</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.200" end="00:43:06.000" style="s2">anything is going to be an actual</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.720" end="00:43:09.359" style="s2">occasion</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.000" end="00:43:11.280" style="s2">and that eternal objects he says ingress</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.359" end="00:43:12.960" style="s2">into actual occasions but the agency is</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.280" end="00:43:14.960" style="s2">with the actual occasions</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.960" end="00:43:16.400" style="s2">right not the forms that have preeminent</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.960" end="00:43:18.319" style="s2">reality and</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.400" end="00:43:21.280" style="s2">that the world of experience is some</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.319" end="00:43:23.359" style="s2">pale imitation or copy</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.280" end="00:43:24.480" style="s2">the forms don&#39;t actually exist until</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.359" end="00:43:25.920" style="s2">they ingress</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.480" end="00:43:29.119" style="s2">in the context of an occasion of</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.920" end="00:43:31.440" style="s2">experience but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.119" end="00:43:32.960" style="s2">they&#39;re real without existing or being</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.440" end="00:43:35.359" style="s2">actual</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.960" end="00:43:36.800" style="s2">they&#39;re eternal which their eternal</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.359" end="00:43:39.440" style="s2">their potentials</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.800" end="00:43:41.280" style="s2">and so whitehead does bring back in this</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.440" end="00:43:44.880" style="s2">notion of a formal</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.280" end="00:43:47.920" style="s2">causality right right um but as</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.880" end="00:43:48.480" style="s2">a as a as a source of possibility that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.920" end="00:43:51.920" style="s2">not yet</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.480" end="00:43:53.680" style="s2">actualized um and</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.920" end="00:43:55.040" style="s2">this again is a there&#39;s a theological</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.680" end="00:43:56.720" style="s2">background here the</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.040" end="00:43:58.160" style="s2">western tradition tends to imagine god</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.720" end="00:44:01.440" style="s2">as pure act</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.160" end="00:44:04.880" style="s2">right pure activity no passivity</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.440" end="00:44:06.319" style="s2">no no no no potential in god</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.880" end="00:44:08.880" style="s2">and whitehead&#39;s like well god has both</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.319" end="00:44:11.760" style="s2">poles yeah because i mean</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.880" end="00:44:12.880" style="s2">so i&#39;m very also deeply influenced by</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.760" end="00:44:14.880" style="s2">the kyoto school</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.880" end="00:44:16.480" style="s2">and you know nishitani and religion and</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.880" end="00:44:17.760" style="s2">nothingness and one initiative&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.480" end="00:44:21.280" style="s2">critique was</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.760" end="00:44:24.480" style="s2">the west&#39;s reduction of realness</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.280" end="00:44:26.480" style="s2">to actuality has really</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.480" end="00:44:27.839" style="s2">hamstrung its ability to respond to the</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.480" end="00:44:30.319" style="s2">problem of nihilism</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.839" end="00:44:31.680" style="s2">because there can be no positive reading</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.319" end="00:44:34.400" style="s2">to emptiness</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.680" end="00:44:36.319" style="s2">right whereas the east has right you</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.400" end="00:44:36.800" style="s2">know the daltech is the space inside the</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.319" end="00:44:38.560" style="s2">cup</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.800" end="00:44:40.000" style="s2">that makes the cup useful and you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.560" end="00:44:43.200" style="s2">those kinds of metaphors</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.000" end="00:44:47.680" style="s2">where and he argues that you know uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.200" end="00:44:49.280" style="s2">potentiality um is is actually given</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.680" end="00:44:52.880" style="s2">also a problematic i would say</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.280" end="00:44:55.440" style="s2">preeminence um in the eastern traditions</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.880" end="00:44:56.000" style="s2">and it strikes me that if we could</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.440" end="00:44:59.280" style="s2">somehow</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.000" end="00:45:00.400" style="s2">get it right you know about the</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.280" end="00:45:02.240" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.400" end="00:45:03.440" style="s2">uh between them if we had a notion of</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.240" end="00:45:05.760" style="s2">realness</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.440" end="00:45:07.200" style="s2">especially of dynamic intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.760" end="00:45:10.480" style="s2">and real novelty</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.200" end="00:45:11.280" style="s2">that somehow could integrate give equal</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.480" end="00:45:14.480" style="s2">prominence</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.280" end="00:45:16.800" style="s2">preeminence or equality again i guess uh</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.480" end="00:45:18.000" style="s2">um equal reverence maybe is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.800" end="00:45:21.680" style="s2">word i wanted</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.000" end="00:45:23.760" style="s2">to actuality as a ground of realness</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.680" end="00:45:25.760" style="s2">and to possibility as a ground of</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.760" end="00:45:28.160" style="s2">realness i</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.760" end="00:45:28.800" style="s2">i think that would that would go a long</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.160" end="00:45:30.560" style="s2">way because</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.800" end="00:45:32.480" style="s2">i think i mean i think religion and</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.560" end="00:45:35.440" style="s2">nothingness is one of the great books</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.480" end="00:45:37.200" style="s2">i i think his argument about um the fact</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.440" end="00:45:40.720" style="s2">that that nietzsche was ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.200" end="00:45:41.520" style="s2">bound into a metaphysics that equated</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.720" end="00:45:43.359" style="s2">actuality</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.520" end="00:45:44.560" style="s2">with realness that he couldn&#39;t he</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.359" end="00:45:45.839" style="s2">couldn&#39;t go through the greatest</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.560" end="00:45:48.000" style="s2">he couldn&#39;t go through the greatest not</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.839" end="00:45:50.960" style="s2">of all the doubt that flips</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.000" end="00:45:52.640" style="s2">and allows you to see the emptiness is</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.960" end="00:45:54.160" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.640" end="00:45:56.319" style="s2">the ground of possibility as what is</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.160" end="00:45:57.200" style="s2">most real</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.319" end="00:45:59.599" style="s2">what do you think about that as a</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.200" end="00:46:01.760" style="s2">proposal</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.599" end="00:46:02.640" style="s2">again nishitani is a philosopher i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.760" end="00:46:05.920" style="s2">i&#39;ve only read</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.640" end="00:46:07.680" style="s2">um about that there&#39;s a philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.920" end="00:46:08.800" style="s2">named um jason wirth that writes a lot</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.680" end="00:46:11.040" style="s2">on shelling</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.800" end="00:46:12.720" style="s2">yeah uh and he writes some books he has</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.040" end="00:46:14.160" style="s2">a book where he compares nishitani and</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.720" end="00:46:15.119" style="s2">shelling so i know nishtani in that</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.160" end="00:46:16.880" style="s2">context and</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.119" end="00:46:18.720" style="s2">i agree i love what you&#39;re saying about</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.880" end="00:46:20.480" style="s2">how the west responds to nothing and it</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.720" end="00:46:23.359" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really have a positive</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.480" end="00:46:24.800" style="s2">deal for it to play or to emptiness and</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.359" end="00:46:29.440" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.800" end="00:46:33.359" style="s2">i think um that that&#39;s crucial</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.440" end="00:46:34.560" style="s2">and um</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.359" end="00:46:37.040" style="s2">i wanted to go somewhere else with that</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.560" end="00:46:38.640" style="s2">but it i&#39;ve lost it um</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.040" end="00:46:40.880" style="s2">well take a moment matt there&#39;s no rush</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.640" end="00:46:45.040" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.880" end="00:46:45.040" style="s2">i don&#39;t know that fire is coming um</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.760" end="00:46:52.160" style="s2">yeah well nietzsche you you know i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.319" end="00:46:56.560" style="s2">written a little bit comparing him</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.160" end="00:46:59.119" style="s2">at least his late um writings</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.560" end="00:47:00.880" style="s2">on will to power and he starts to</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.119" end="00:47:02.240" style="s2">articulate uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.880" end="00:47:04.319" style="s2">and he may have been losing his mind at</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.240" end="00:47:07.680" style="s2">this point but he starts to articulate</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.319" end="00:47:09.520" style="s2">an ontology that&#39;s based on um power and</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.680" end="00:47:12.079" style="s2">perspective it&#39;s some sometimes called</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.520" end="00:47:14.480" style="s2">perspectivism</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.079" end="00:47:15.760" style="s2">that&#39;s very similar to whiteheads in</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.480" end="00:47:20.000" style="s2">some ways</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.760" end="00:47:21.760" style="s2">uh where he um nisha says something like</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.000" end="00:47:23.520" style="s2">look it&#39;s not that there&#39;s no meaning</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.760" end="00:47:24.000" style="s2">it&#39;s that there&#39;s too much meaning in</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.520" end="00:47:26.000" style="s2">effect</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.000" end="00:47:28.079" style="s2">in other words there&#39;s too many</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.000" end="00:47:28.800" style="s2">perspectives vying for one another to</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.079" end="00:47:30.480" style="s2">dominate</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.800" end="00:47:32.880" style="s2">and win out as the perspective that</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.480" end="00:47:35.839" style="s2">that&#39;s truly meaningful so he&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.880" end="00:47:37.839" style="s2">his nihilism there is like not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.839" end="00:47:40.079" style="s2">that there&#39;s nothing it&#39;s that we need a</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.839" end="00:47:40.079" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.800" end="00:47:45.920" style="s2">we we&#39;ve lost an orientation amidst the</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.480" end="00:47:49.520" style="s2">plurality of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.920" end="00:47:53.119" style="s2">that can guide us towards more valuable</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.520" end="00:47:56.240" style="s2">and virtuous modes of existence i guess</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.119" end="00:47:59.200" style="s2">uh and because the old religious</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.240" end="00:48:00.880" style="s2">setup was was collapsing as capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.200" end="00:48:03.119" style="s2">and secularism</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.880" end="00:48:04.079" style="s2">rolled in and you know nietzsche lost</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.119" end="00:48:06.880" style="s2">his mind</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.079" end="00:48:08.400" style="s2">i think as a result of of losing that</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.880" end="00:48:12.000" style="s2">orientation</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.400" end="00:48:14.400" style="s2">recognizing nihilism but again it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.000" end="00:48:15.680" style="s2">his last semi-coherent writing is</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.400" end="00:48:18.559" style="s2">pointing out that it&#39;s not that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.680" end="00:48:22.079" style="s2">no meaning it&#39;s that there&#39;s too much</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.559" end="00:48:25.520" style="s2">yeah uh so that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.079" end="00:48:28.079" style="s2">because that&#39;s kind of like the issue of</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.520" end="00:48:28.640" style="s2">about combinatorial explosion of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.079" end="00:48:31.520" style="s2">available</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.640" end="00:48:32.880" style="s2">information yeah um and i i think</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.520" end="00:48:34.480" style="s2">there&#39;s something deeply right about</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.880" end="00:48:38.240" style="s2">that um</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.480" end="00:48:40.079" style="s2">so the idea of emptiness</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.240" end="00:48:41.680" style="s2">is i think reconciliable with that</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.079" end="00:48:44.720" style="s2">because the idea of emptiness</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.680" end="00:48:46.559" style="s2">is also like it&#39;s intertwined with</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.720" end="00:48:48.000" style="s2">the note the notion of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.559" end="00:48:51.440" style="s2">interpenetration of everything</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.000" end="00:48:53.440" style="s2">with everything else right it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.440" end="00:48:54.720" style="s2">but the idea i&#39;m just wondering if</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.440" end="00:48:57.119" style="s2">there&#39;s a way of bringing</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.720" end="00:48:57.839" style="s2">bringing back nishitani&#39;s critique of</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.119" end="00:49:00.960" style="s2">saying</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.839" end="00:49:03.440" style="s2">yeah but what would be needed right</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.960" end="00:49:04.480" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be just like the solution to</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.440" end="00:49:05.119" style="s2">nietzsche&#39;s problem of too many</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.480" end="00:49:07.040" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.119" end="00:49:08.880" style="s2">isn&#39;t one perspective dominating all the</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.040" end="00:49:10.160" style="s2">perspectives it has to be something</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.880" end="00:49:12.160" style="s2">that&#39;s transparent</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.160" end="00:49:14.079" style="s2">if you&#39;ll allow me to neologism here</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.160" end="00:49:16.480" style="s2">it&#39;s trans perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.079" end="00:49:18.400" style="s2">and therefore gives a ground in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.480" end="00:49:20.400" style="s2">which perspectives can be judged and</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.400" end="00:49:23.040" style="s2">evaluated</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.400" end="00:49:24.160" style="s2">right and then that&#39;s still where i</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.040" end="00:49:25.680" style="s2">think nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.160" end="00:49:27.680" style="s2">you know if you stare too long into the</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.680" end="00:49:29.119" style="s2">abyss it begins to stare back into you</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.680" end="00:49:30.720" style="s2">i think that&#39;s still where there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.119" end="00:49:33.040" style="s2">abysmal element</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.720" end="00:49:33.920" style="s2">in nature because he couldn&#39;t ask the</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.040" end="00:49:35.359" style="s2">question of</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.920" end="00:49:37.280" style="s2">what is the ground from which the</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.359" end="00:49:39.200" style="s2">perspectives emerge this takes us back</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.280" end="00:49:41.520" style="s2">to this point we were before of asking</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.200" end="00:49:43.359" style="s2">what is it about reality that makes a</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.520" end="00:49:46.559" style="s2">multiplicity of perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.359" end="00:49:49.920" style="s2">makes this kind of complex and</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.559" end="00:49:52.559" style="s2">and innovative intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.920" end="00:49:53.599" style="s2">possible for us yeah well so it almost</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.559" end="00:49:57.280" style="s2">seems like</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.599" end="00:49:59.440" style="s2">um the the modern mine and</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.280" end="00:50:01.359" style="s2">the post-modern mind nietzsche let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.440" end="00:50:03.920" style="s2">as an exemplar</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.359" end="00:50:04.640" style="s2">is in a sense suffering as a result of</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.920" end="00:50:08.079" style="s2">the loss</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.640" end="00:50:10.800" style="s2">of this transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.079" end="00:50:12.400" style="s2">source of orientation like god as a</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.800" end="00:50:13.680" style="s2">parent yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.400" end="00:50:15.280" style="s2">who&#39;s going to make sure it&#39;s all you</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.680" end="00:50:17.359" style="s2">know god designed this whole thing if</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.280" end="00:50:20.160" style="s2">you&#39;re good it&#39;s going to be okay</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.359" end="00:50:22.640" style="s2">right right we lost that yes and the</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.160" end="00:50:25.359" style="s2">initial response to that could be like</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.640" end="00:50:27.200" style="s2">anger almost yes and you you get this in</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.359" end="00:50:29.440" style="s2">the sort of reactionary</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.200" end="00:50:30.800" style="s2">atheism that it&#39;s kind of died down more</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.440" end="00:50:32.079" style="s2">recently but several years you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.800" end="00:50:33.680" style="s2">there&#39;s the whole</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.079" end="00:50:35.760" style="s2">four horsemen of the apocalypse and</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.680" end="00:50:38.079" style="s2">hitchens and dawkins and those guys but</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.760" end="00:50:39.760" style="s2">there&#39;s an anger that that god doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.079" end="00:50:41.280" style="s2">exist anymore and it&#39;s there&#39;s an anger</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.760" end="00:50:42.240" style="s2">at the people that still believe in it</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.280" end="00:50:44.319" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.240" end="00:50:45.680" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s almost like unfair that</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.319" end="00:50:47.839" style="s2">we don&#39;t have that but</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.680" end="00:50:49.440" style="s2">i think the move to get beyond this</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.839" end="00:50:52.079" style="s2">nihilism</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.440" end="00:50:52.960" style="s2">of being angry that we don&#39;t have a god</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.079" end="00:50:54.400" style="s2">the father</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.960" end="00:50:56.240" style="s2">to like make sure it&#39;s all going to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.400" end="00:50:58.960" style="s2">okay the move is</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.240" end="00:51:00.640" style="s2">is to see an emptiness a source of</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.960" end="00:51:04.240" style="s2">creativity and see</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.640" end="00:51:06.000" style="s2">that it&#39;s not that we can&#39;t relate to</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.240" end="00:51:09.520" style="s2">something like god anymore</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.000" end="00:51:12.240" style="s2">it&#39;s that we&#39;re responsible for enacting</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.520" end="00:51:12.880" style="s2">that dimension of reality yeah well put</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.240" end="00:51:15.920" style="s2">well right</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.880" end="00:51:17.920" style="s2">we&#39;re involved in it and if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.920" end="00:51:18.960" style="s2">it&#39;s like you know anthropologists will</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.920" end="00:51:22.559" style="s2">point out that many</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.960" end="00:51:25.440" style="s2">um primal peoples will</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.559" end="00:51:26.480" style="s2">view ritual as uh sort of symbolic i</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.440" end="00:51:27.839" style="s2">mean they don&#39;t view it as symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.480" end="00:51:29.760" style="s2">enactment themselves that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.839" end="00:51:31.920" style="s2">anthropological view from the outside</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.760" end="00:51:33.359" style="s2">but that that they feel like if they</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.920" end="00:51:34.880" style="s2">stopped performing the ritual the</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.359" end="00:51:37.520" style="s2">universe would fall to pieces</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.880" end="00:51:38.480" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah you know and for a modern</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.520" end="00:51:40.480" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.480" end="00:51:41.680" style="s2">yeah yeah participant well the modern</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.480" end="00:51:42.240" style="s2">person would be like well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.680" end="00:51:44.000" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:51:42.240" end="00:51:45.200" style="s2">it&#39;s obviously not gonna fall apart if</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.000" end="00:51:46.720" style="s2">you don&#39;t pray to this you know the</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.200" end="00:51:47.680" style="s2">sun&#39;s gonna keep rising even if you</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.720" end="00:51:49.280" style="s2">don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.680" end="00:51:51.440" style="s2">you know bow to it in reverence every</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.280" end="00:51:53.760" style="s2">morning and yet</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.440" end="00:51:55.119" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a deeper way in which</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.760" end="00:51:57.680" style="s2">we lose touch with</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.119" end="00:51:58.559" style="s2">the meaning of the sunrise if we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.680" end="00:52:00.720" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.559" end="00:52:01.599" style="s2">reverential as we as we take in that</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.720" end="00:52:04.640" style="s2">spectacle</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.599" end="00:52:07.359" style="s2">yeah something does collapse</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.640" end="00:52:09.760" style="s2">yeah the conduit that connects our</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.359" end="00:52:13.119" style="s2">consciousness to its cosmic ground</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.760" end="00:52:15.520" style="s2">gets severed yes and so yeah we need to</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.119" end="00:52:18.559" style="s2">take responsibility for</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.520" end="00:52:20.240" style="s2">god making you know yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.559" end="00:52:22.240" style="s2">i don&#39;t mean that in a purely socially</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.240" end="00:52:25.359" style="s2">constructivist sense or anything</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.240" end="00:52:26.400" style="s2">i mean it like we have a biological</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.359" end="00:52:30.000" style="s2">instinct</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.400" end="00:52:33.040" style="s2">for god making that is what allows us to</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.000" end="00:52:35.440" style="s2">form societies and complex civilizations</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.040" end="00:52:36.720" style="s2">and we&#39;ve lost that and so yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.440" end="00:52:38.240" style="s2">thing&#39;s collapsing and this has happened</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.720" end="00:52:41.359" style="s2">before it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.240" end="00:52:42.720" style="s2">new but theology is important and</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.359" end="00:52:45.119" style="s2">religion is important</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.720" end="00:52:46.000" style="s2">it&#39;s just they&#39;re different metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.119" end="00:52:48.960" style="s2">context within which</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.000" end="00:52:50.079" style="s2">to interpret what it is and if we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.960" end="00:52:51.680" style="s2">lost the old</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.079" end="00:52:53.680" style="s2">notion of a transcendent god it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.680" end="00:52:56.720" style="s2">mean there&#39;s not some</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.680" end="00:52:57.760" style="s2">function that god can play and whitehead</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.720" end="00:52:59.119" style="s2">i just want to share a quote from</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.760" end="00:53:00.880" style="s2">whitehead and then i&#39;ll want to hear</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.119" end="00:53:02.400" style="s2">what you think about this but</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.880" end="00:53:03.680" style="s2">whitehead says in process and reality</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.400" end="00:53:05.200" style="s2">and i don&#39;t know if you got this far but</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.680" end="00:53:06.880" style="s2">he says uh</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.200" end="00:53:08.640" style="s2">one of the most important functions for</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.880" end="00:53:11.680" style="s2">philosophy in the modern world</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.640" end="00:53:15.440" style="s2">is to secularize the function of god</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.680" end="00:53:18.480" style="s2">yeah in our ontology</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.440" end="00:53:21.839" style="s2">um and i think a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.480" end="00:53:23.760" style="s2">my work is rooted in that</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.839" end="00:53:25.119" style="s2">call that white had made yeah he</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.760" end="00:53:27.520" style="s2">attempted to do it and i don&#39;t think his</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.119" end="00:53:30.640" style="s2">process theology is ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.520" end="00:53:33.839" style="s2">fully um</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.640" end="00:53:35.520" style="s2">coherent even but it&#39;s at least uh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.839" end="00:53:37.119" style="s2">at least a sketch of the direction we</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.520" end="00:53:39.520" style="s2">need to move in to like hold</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.119" end="00:53:41.839" style="s2">opposites and polar tension and</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.520" end="00:53:44.480" style="s2">recognize the potentiality in god and</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.839" end="00:53:47.280" style="s2">not just the actuality yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.480" end="00:53:48.480" style="s2">so yeah that that&#39;s i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.280" end="00:53:51.839" style="s2">beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.480" end="00:53:56.240" style="s2">i i really like how you</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.839" end="00:53:59.520" style="s2">put that so i wanted i i</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.240" end="00:54:01.119" style="s2">i wonder then so i mentioned earlier on</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.520" end="00:54:03.760" style="s2">that i i sometimes want to add a</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.119" end="00:54:05.440" style="s2">fifth e because it and this i predict</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.760" end="00:54:07.440" style="s2">it&#39;s going to come into more prominence</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.440" end="00:54:09.040" style="s2">in cognitive science especially because</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.440" end="00:54:10.559" style="s2">of the i think groundbreaking work being</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.040" end="00:54:13.599" style="s2">done by michael anderson</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.559" end="00:54:14.640" style="s2">and beyond uh uh phonology and and the</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.599" end="00:54:17.680" style="s2">hen and others</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.640" end="00:54:19.440" style="s2">and the circuit reuse hypothesis and and</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.680" end="00:54:22.480" style="s2">this is the idea that the brain is a</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.440" end="00:54:24.400" style="s2">sort of an uh an exacting machine um</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.480" end="00:54:27.359" style="s2">that what it does is it can take</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.400" end="00:54:27.920" style="s2">circuitry that evolved for one function</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.359" end="00:54:30.880" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.920" end="00:54:33.359" style="s2">exact it right because every every</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.880" end="00:54:37.200" style="s2">entity has not only its intended effects</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.359" end="00:54:38.640" style="s2">it has side effects and it&#39;s possible to</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.200" end="00:54:40.880" style="s2">find the configuration of the side</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.640" end="00:54:43.040" style="s2">effects that are also functional</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.880" end="00:54:44.559" style="s2">in another environment and so evolution</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.040" end="00:54:47.440" style="s2">typically doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.559" end="00:54:49.040" style="s2">uh from scratch and then if you if you</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.440" end="00:54:49.920" style="s2">adopt a model which i argue if you are</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.040" end="00:54:52.000" style="s2">at length other</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.920" end="00:54:53.680" style="s2">elsewhere that you need to see cognition</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.000" end="00:54:55.839" style="s2">as you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.680" end="00:54:56.960" style="s2">something deeply analogous uh to</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.839" end="00:54:58.720" style="s2">evolution in which it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.960" end="00:55:00.160" style="s2">dynamically introducing variation and</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.720" end="00:55:01.520" style="s2">then putting selective pressure on it</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.160" end="00:55:03.040" style="s2">etc</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.520" end="00:55:04.839" style="s2">then it makes sense to think about a</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.040" end="00:55:08.640" style="s2">cognitive version of</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.839" end="00:55:11.839" style="s2">acceptation a biological</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.640" end="00:55:12.880" style="s2">cultural example is my tongue right it</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.839" end="00:55:15.599" style="s2">evolved for</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.880" end="00:55:17.520" style="s2">poison detection and mastication but</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.599" end="00:55:20.000" style="s2">it&#39;s been accepted for speech</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.520" end="00:55:20.880" style="s2">most organisms who have tongues don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.000" end="00:55:24.880" style="s2">have speech</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.880" end="00:55:28.240" style="s2">or right but it&#39;s been accepted yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.880" end="00:55:29.760" style="s2">is it possible that so this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.240" end="00:55:31.520" style="s2">wildly speculative</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.760" end="00:55:33.280" style="s2">but we&#39;re we&#39;re we&#39;re playing in an</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.520" end="00:55:34.960" style="s2">adventure of ideas right and whitehead</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.280" end="00:55:36.319" style="s2">talks about that airplane has to take</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.960" end="00:55:37.599" style="s2">flight but it has to be able to land</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.319" end="00:55:39.280" style="s2">again so hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.599" end="00:55:41.760" style="s2">well i&#39;m very comfortable in my armchair</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.280" end="00:55:41.760" style="s2">so let&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.839" end="00:55:44.960" style="s2">i&#39;m wondering if because you talked</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.200" end="00:55:47.119" style="s2">about that yet we have let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.960" end="00:55:48.960" style="s2">you know it&#39;s the augustine notion right</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.119" end="00:55:50.720" style="s2">that we have this sort of god function</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.960" end="00:55:52.799" style="s2">and i i agree with you i take that very</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.720" end="00:55:54.559" style="s2">seriously and i&#39;m wondering if one of</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.799" end="00:55:57.920" style="s2">the jobs</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.559" end="00:56:00.079" style="s2">of the reworking in our ontology the</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.920" end="00:56:03.520" style="s2">code you know the reader the reinvention</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.079" end="00:56:06.559" style="s2">of reason and rationality is to afford</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.520" end="00:56:07.760" style="s2">an exactation of that function in a way</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.559" end="00:56:10.400" style="s2">that now fits</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.760" end="00:56:11.760" style="s2">the context that we are in that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.400" end="00:56:14.079" style="s2">part of</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.760" end="00:56:14.960" style="s2">what that ontology should be doing</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.079" end="00:56:16.720" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.960" end="00:56:18.319" style="s2">part of the meaning crisis another way</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.720" end="00:56:21.040" style="s2">of understanding the meeting crisis</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.319" end="00:56:22.160" style="s2">is that function is hungry within us and</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.040" end="00:56:23.839" style="s2">it can&#39;t find</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.160" end="00:56:25.680" style="s2">a place to operate and what the</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.839" end="00:56:26.400" style="s2">demographics show like with the rise of</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.680" end="00:56:28.720" style="s2">the nuns is</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.400" end="00:56:29.680" style="s2">these people aren&#39;t sort of dawkins uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.720" end="00:56:32.480" style="s2">you know atheists</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.680" end="00:56:34.880" style="s2">no no no that hunger is expressing</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.480" end="00:56:38.160" style="s2">itself in all kinds of auto didactic</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.880" end="00:56:41.280" style="s2">fragmentary often weird metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.160" end="00:56:43.280" style="s2">and and you know uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.280" end="00:56:44.319" style="s2">small scale narcissistically based</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.280" end="00:56:46.160" style="s2">religions</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.319" end="00:56:47.440" style="s2">uh you know the religion of me and</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.160" end="00:56:51.119" style="s2">things like that</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.440" end="00:56:54.000" style="s2">of which i&#39;m quite critical uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.119" end="00:56:55.359" style="s2">so i don&#39;t think that function can go</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.000" end="00:56:58.160" style="s2">unaddressed</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.359" end="00:56:58.720" style="s2">uh but as you&#39;ve indicated i think uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.160" end="00:57:01.520" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.720" end="00:57:02.640" style="s2">we can&#39;t simply return um because you</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.520" end="00:57:05.440" style="s2">you know you mentioned like</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.640" end="00:57:06.319" style="s2">literalisms and fundamentalisms are also</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.440" end="00:57:09.440" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.319" end="00:57:12.079" style="s2">a problematic and profound way yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.440" end="00:57:12.559" style="s2">so could it be that one of the functions</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.079" end="00:57:15.440" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.559" end="00:57:16.960" style="s2">that this one one of the design features</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.440" end="00:57:18.799" style="s2">that one of the things we demand from</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.960" end="00:57:21.200" style="s2">this ontology in order to</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.799" end="00:57:22.000" style="s2">you know pragmatically evaluate it as</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.200" end="00:57:24.880" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.000" end="00:57:26.000" style="s2">is that it can afford an exactation of</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.880" end="00:57:29.280" style="s2">that god function so</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.000" end="00:57:31.520" style="s2">it it is now adaptively engaged again</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.280" end="00:57:32.960" style="s2">once again for individuals and for</p>

<p begin="00:57:54.720" end="00:57:57.760" style="s2">kaufman and um terence deacon were at</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.200" end="00:58:00.880" style="s2">the table</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.760" end="00:58:02.079" style="s2">when i was presenting on the paper on</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.880" end="00:58:04.079" style="s2">whitehead&#39;s view of the evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.079" end="00:58:05.760" style="s2">religion and uh the two of them got into</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.079" end="00:58:06.960" style="s2">an interesting argument after</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.760" end="00:58:08.880" style="s2">i was supposed to be getting questions</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.960" end="00:58:11.680" style="s2">but they were arguing instead</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.880" end="00:58:12.480" style="s2">but um so yeah i love that that</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.680" end="00:58:16.240" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.480" end="00:58:18.160" style="s2">and um i think one of the ways that i</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.240" end="00:58:21.280" style="s2">would look at this is to say that</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.160" end="00:58:25.520" style="s2">you know human human beings um as</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.280" end="00:58:26.079" style="s2">the evolution of religion unfolded</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.520" end="00:58:29.839" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.079" end="00:58:32.880" style="s2">these phases of initially um just like</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.839" end="00:58:35.599" style="s2">ritual um you know dancing and singing</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.880" end="00:58:35.599" style="s2">around a fire</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.680" end="00:58:40.000" style="s2">gradually taking on the forms uh forms</p>

<p begin="00:58:40.000" end="00:58:45.760" style="s2">and narrative uh and and symbol</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.119" end="00:58:46.799" style="s2">um that get elaborated in in fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.760" end="00:58:48.559" style="s2">ways and</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.799" end="00:58:51.200" style="s2">for most of our species history this was</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.559" end="00:58:53.520" style="s2">done in a kind of tribalized context</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.200" end="00:58:55.280" style="s2">um there weren&#39;t any universal religions</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.520" end="00:58:56.799" style="s2">until the axial age</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.280" end="00:58:59.359" style="s2">right you start to get a more</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.799" end="00:59:00.960" style="s2">theoretical elaboration upon</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.359" end="00:59:03.359" style="s2">the ritual practice and symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.960" end="00:59:06.079" style="s2">collaboration yeah and the</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.359" end="00:59:07.280" style="s2">narrative around the the rituals and</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.079" end="00:59:09.280" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.280" end="00:59:11.359" style="s2">it&#39;s as if it&#39;s one way that i like to</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.280" end="00:59:13.280" style="s2">imagine this whole process is like</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.359" end="00:59:15.520" style="s2">it&#39;s as if the this like human</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.280" end="00:59:17.520" style="s2">consciousness is being um</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.520" end="00:59:18.640" style="s2">sort of sheltered and grown within an</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.520" end="00:59:21.839" style="s2">increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.640" end="00:59:23.040" style="s2">elaborate and thick shell and like it</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.839" end="00:59:25.200" style="s2">climaxes in</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.040" end="00:59:26.160" style="s2">in i mean all over the world but to use</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.200" end="00:59:29.520" style="s2">the you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.160" end="00:59:31.839" style="s2">example of in like um the christian and</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.520" end="00:59:33.839" style="s2">islamic and judaic traditions like these</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.839" end="00:59:34.960" style="s2">monumental temple structures and</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.839" end="00:59:36.319" style="s2">cathedrals and</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.960" end="00:59:38.240" style="s2">i mean there were temples before that</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.319" end="00:59:39.920" style="s2">too but it&#39;s almost like we&#39;re growing a</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.240" end="00:59:43.040" style="s2">shell around ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.920" end="00:59:43.440" style="s2">at some point in modern europe we sort</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.040" end="00:59:46.400" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.440" end="00:59:48.640" style="s2">our consciousness got big enough to</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.400" end="00:59:51.359" style="s2">break out of that shell</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.640" end="00:59:52.319" style="s2">and we all of our development</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.359" end="00:59:55.680" style="s2">cognitively</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.319" end="00:59:58.559" style="s2">and ethically to the point where</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.680" end="01:00:00.799" style="s2">modern science was born was was</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.559" end="01:00:03.040" style="s2">sheltered by this religious context</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.799" end="01:00:04.400" style="s2">yes um but then what that religious</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.040" end="01:00:08.240" style="s2">context gave birth to</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.400" end="01:00:12.720" style="s2">broke from the shell and now we&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.240" end="01:00:15.680" style="s2">naked without any of the ritual symbolic</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.720" end="01:00:16.480" style="s2">uh narrative context that gave birth to</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.680" end="01:00:19.760" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.480" end="01:00:23.599" style="s2">and we have some surrogate</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.760" end="01:00:26.160" style="s2">um sheltering that technology affords</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.599" end="01:00:27.119" style="s2">and communication media now have</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.160" end="01:00:29.119" style="s2">completely</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.119" end="01:00:30.720" style="s2">almost re-encapsulated us within a new</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.119" end="01:00:33.599" style="s2">kind of shell</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.720" end="01:00:34.480" style="s2">that&#39;s not rooted in like virtue or</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.599" end="01:00:37.680" style="s2">deliberate</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.480" end="01:00:38.400" style="s2">contemplative practice or anything like</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.680" end="01:00:41.359" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.400" end="01:00:42.400" style="s2">it&#39;s rooted in consumer capitalism but</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.359" end="01:00:45.440" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.400" end="01:00:46.960" style="s2">we we can&#39;t avoid the way that this this</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.440" end="01:00:48.640" style="s2">this shell grows around our</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.960" end="01:00:50.799" style="s2">consciousness to shape the way the</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.640" end="01:00:53.760" style="s2">values of our society and</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.799" end="01:00:55.760" style="s2">and and gives us a a sense of</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.760" end="01:00:58.400" style="s2">orientation amidst</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.760" end="01:00:59.280" style="s2">the cosmogenesis you know that we emerge</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.400" end="01:01:02.319" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.280" end="01:01:04.400" style="s2">and i feel like you know like your work</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.319" end="01:01:05.680" style="s2">is an attempt to say well wait a minute</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.400" end="01:01:07.440" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.680" end="01:01:09.280" style="s2">we need to re-engage with some of those</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.440" end="01:01:11.119" style="s2">wisdom traditions</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.280" end="01:01:13.440" style="s2">in the context of our modern scientific</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.119" end="01:01:15.680" style="s2">knowledge and technological capacity</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.440" end="01:01:16.960" style="s2">and if we can bring these two together</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.680" end="01:01:19.520" style="s2">and integrate</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.960" end="01:01:21.200" style="s2">um the insight of modern science the</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.520" end="01:01:22.319" style="s2">power of modern technology with the</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.200" end="01:01:24.720" style="s2">wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.319" end="01:01:25.839" style="s2">of these these traditions and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.720" end="01:01:29.119" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.839" end="01:01:31.200" style="s2">global monopoly of options um</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.119" end="01:01:32.960" style="s2">that are intimately there&#39;s a there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.200" end="01:01:34.720" style="s2">evolutionary process that ties all the</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.960" end="01:01:36.559" style="s2">religions together i would say</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.720" end="01:01:38.880" style="s2">i&#39;m not a perennialist in the sense that</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.559" end="01:01:40.319" style="s2">i think there&#39;s one original revelation</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.880" end="01:01:42.240" style="s2">and all the religions are like</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.319" end="01:01:44.079" style="s2">different paths up the mountain i take</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.240" end="01:01:45.280" style="s2">jorge&#39;s perspective jorge ferreira&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.079" end="01:01:48.240" style="s2">perspective on</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.280" end="01:01:48.799" style="s2">rather than the mountain with many paths</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.240" end="01:01:51.680" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.799" end="01:01:52.480" style="s2">an ocean with many shores yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.680" end="01:01:56.000" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.480" end="01:01:56.880" style="s2">but yeah so uh that&#39;s kind of how i see</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.000" end="01:02:00.000" style="s2">it it&#39;s like we</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.880" end="01:02:01.680" style="s2">we can&#39;t avoid building this like this</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.000" end="01:02:02.880" style="s2">shell around ourselves to to give us a</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.680" end="01:02:05.440" style="s2">sense of orientation</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.880" end="01:02:06.799" style="s2">and protection from an otherwise chaotic</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.440" end="01:02:09.520" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.799" end="01:02:11.599" style="s2">and religion used to serve that function</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.520" end="01:02:14.000" style="s2">and we need to um</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.599" end="01:02:16.160" style="s2">find a way of becoming reverential again</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.000" end="01:02:19.200" style="s2">in a in a scientific</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.160" end="01:02:22.400" style="s2">context in the midst of an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.200" end="01:02:23.280" style="s2">and evolving universe yeah that&#39;s very</p>

<p begin="01:03:57.599" end="01:04:01.200" style="s2">because i found what we did today very</p>

<p begin="01:04:04.559" end="01:04:07.760" style="s2">avenue here&#39;s a proposal one thing i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.559" end="01:04:09.440" style="s2">like to talk to you about</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.760" end="01:04:12.240" style="s2">because i mentioned it earlier but i</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.440" end="01:04:15.200" style="s2">think this this this whitehead in model</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.240" end="01:04:17.359" style="s2">you know where the the the the the the</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.200" end="01:04:20.160" style="s2">two are folding into each other</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.359" end="01:04:20.880" style="s2">in that creativity and and the polarity</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.160" end="01:04:23.599" style="s2">of it</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.880" end="01:04:26.480" style="s2">i i think that&#39;s very consonant with a</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.599" end="01:04:27.599" style="s2">dialogical model of reason and i&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.480" end="01:04:30.000" style="s2">to explore</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.599" end="01:04:32.880" style="s2">because that would be a way of getting</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.000" end="01:04:35.359" style="s2">you know a deeper conformity between</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.880" end="01:04:37.760" style="s2">um you know the reinvention of</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.359" end="01:04:40.799" style="s2">rationality and the reinvention</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.760" end="01:04:43.280" style="s2">of reality um and i think that</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.799" end="01:04:45.200" style="s2">you know and and the model that again i</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.280" end="01:04:47.200" style="s2">have in mind is erigina&#39;s model about</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.200" end="01:04:48.559" style="s2">the dialectic isn&#39;t only a way of</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.200" end="01:04:51.440" style="s2">unfolding</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.559" end="01:04:53.119" style="s2">you know human rationality it is</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.440" end="01:04:57.039" style="s2">actually sort of the grammar</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.119" end="01:04:59.440" style="s2">uh of of of god and of reality</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.039" end="01:05:00.799" style="s2">um so i&#39;d like to explore that with you</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.440" end="01:05:02.240" style="s2">if you if you think if you think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.799" end="01:05:04.319" style="s2">an interesting proposal</p>

<p begin="01:05:48.960" end="01:05:56.400" style="s2">without being flimsy or being sort of</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.319" end="01:05:59.039" style="s2">soft um and i find that commendable</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.400" end="01:06:01.200" style="s2">there&#39;s a richness there&#39;s a resiliency</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.039" end="01:06:04.039" style="s2">but there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.200" end="01:06:06.079" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s no sort of ruthless</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.039" end="01:06:08.559" style="s2">self-promotion or</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.079" end="01:06:09.520" style="s2">i just i i given what we&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.559" end="01:06:12.160" style="s2">earlier i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.520" end="01:06:12.960" style="s2">important to recognize uh epistemic</p>

<p begin="01:06:14.480" end="01:06:18.880" style="s2">exemplifying it in a wonderful way</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.319" end="01:06:19.520" style="s2">so in addition to the really rich</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.880" end="01:06:21.599" style="s2">content</p>

<p begin="01:06:21.599" end="01:06:24.799" style="s2">presentation is also something</p>
