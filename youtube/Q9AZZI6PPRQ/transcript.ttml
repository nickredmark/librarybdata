<p begin="00:00:19.610" end="00:00:27.520" style="s2">about gaming game be if you still want</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.400" end="00:00:27.520" style="s2">to ask it just just go off you sure</p>

<p begin="00:00:48.980" end="00:00:54.649" style="s2">into a sort of game a fundamentalism and</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.550" end="00:00:57.530" style="s2">have been for many decades this is the</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.649" end="00:01:00.829" style="s2">sort of blue church idea and my question</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.530" end="00:01:03.829" style="s2">to you is does the game be proud to what</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.829" end="00:01:06.890" style="s2">you know about have any concrete plan</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.829" end="00:01:09.229" style="s2">from going secondly from nudging these</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.890" end="00:01:12.380" style="s2">people&#39;s decisions to actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.229" end="00:01:14.870" style="s2">transforming their framework because</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.380" end="00:01:17.500" style="s2">obviously we&#39;ve heard individually</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.870" end="00:01:20.420" style="s2">upgrading our sovereignty being able to</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.500" end="00:01:23.840" style="s2">be more effective agents individually</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.420" end="00:01:25.810" style="s2">but I don&#39;t know if maybe behind the</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.840" end="00:01:29.799" style="s2">scenes there have been talks on how to</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.810" end="00:01:32.810" style="s2">scale that up is this at all possible I</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.799" end="00:01:34.969" style="s2">mean I&#39;m gonna I mean I&#39;m talking with</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.810" end="00:01:37.189" style="s2">the person who gave us the gmae gave me</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.969" end="00:01:39.560" style="s2">blue church Jordan all and part of that</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.189" end="00:01:41.210" style="s2">is this idea which is the religion</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.560" end="00:01:43.460" style="s2">that&#39;s not a religion and coming trying</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.210" end="00:01:46.159" style="s2">to come up with a post religious faith</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.460" end="00:01:49.130" style="s2">because here&#39;s the idea this is probably</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.159" end="00:01:51.439" style="s2">the mum ways my most radical idea I want</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.130" end="00:01:53.869" style="s2">to do what like Augustine did as the</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.439" end="00:01:55.850" style="s2">Roman Empire is falling he laid the</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.869" end="00:01:58.310" style="s2">foundations not single-handedly and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.850" end="00:02:01.340" style="s2">not saying I&#39;m Augustine so please I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.310" end="00:02:02.689" style="s2">just using this as an analogy okay but</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.340" end="00:02:04.280" style="s2">what they did is they laid the fact they</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.689" end="00:02:05.899" style="s2">laid the cultural cognitive grammar for</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.280" end="00:02:09.410" style="s2">an entirely different culture and they</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.899" end="00:02:10.970" style="s2">stole the culture bottom-up from the</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.410" end="00:02:13.010" style="s2">imperial system now again the imperial</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.970" end="00:02:16.400" style="s2">system at some point then clamped down</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.010" end="00:02:18.320" style="s2">again but nevertheless we shifted to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.400" end="00:02:23.080" style="s2">middle that we shifted out of antiquity</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.320" end="00:02:27.530" style="s2">we shifted to a different world and so I</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.080" end="00:02:29.680" style="s2">want to try and do that I want to try</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.530" end="00:02:33.080" style="s2">and create</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.680" end="00:02:35.120" style="s2">the systems of meaning the religion</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.080" end="00:02:39.920" style="s2">that&#39;s not a religion the ecologies of</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.120" end="00:02:41.930" style="s2">practices the the communities the</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.920" end="00:02:45.190" style="s2">networks of communities all of this it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.930" end="00:02:48.890" style="s2">already happening we really empower it</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.190" end="00:02:50.720" style="s2">both in terms of its grammar give it the</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.890" end="00:02:52.040" style="s2">best scientific tools for engineering</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.720" end="00:02:54.170" style="s2">the practices and the ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.040" end="00:02:58.040" style="s2">practices I basically want to steal the</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.170" end="00:03:01.250" style="s2">culture from the people who have been</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.040" end="00:03:04.040" style="s2">abusing us for such a very long time and</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.250" end="00:03:06.079" style="s2">I usually don&#39;t speak politically you</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.040" end="00:03:09.560" style="s2">because I think the political framing</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.079" end="00:03:11.750" style="s2">is often a deep misrepresentation of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.560" end="00:03:14.329" style="s2">issue at least the way in which</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.750" end="00:03:16.730" style="s2">political discourse has been as you said</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.329" end="00:03:18.590" style="s2">it sort of been ossified and I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.730" end="00:03:20.780" style="s2">this also I think Dan was pointing out</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.590" end="00:03:24.500" style="s2">that too the way it&#39;s been ossified in</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.780" end="00:03:27.829" style="s2">ways that make choice no longer it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.500" end="00:03:30.379" style="s2">sort of really relevant so all right</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.829" end="00:03:32.900" style="s2">this is my sort of most radical thing I</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.379" end="00:03:35.060" style="s2">guess I&#39;m gonna say because I want yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.900" end="00:03:38.569" style="s2">I want to help steal the culture away</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.060" end="00:03:42.739" style="s2">steal it away and do everything I can</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.569" end="00:03:45.200" style="s2">and you know Christianity stoled the</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.739" end="00:03:47.989" style="s2">culture away from the elites it&#39;s time</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.200" end="00:03:50.569" style="s2">now new elites form they always will but</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.989" end="00:03:54.319" style="s2">the culture changed and it changed in an</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.569" end="00:03:56.870" style="s2">important way and that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.319" end="00:03:58.819" style="s2">to do right now and that&#39;s that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.870" end="00:04:03.560" style="s2">see myself doing with a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.819" end="00:04:05.810" style="s2">other people that&#39;s very noble and you</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.560" end="00:04:08.180" style="s2">certainly have a lot of people who</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.810" end="00:04:10.400" style="s2">aren&#39;t in those positions I mean if</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.180" end="00:04:12.440" style="s2">you&#39;re amides you&#39;ve sort of grown up in</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.400" end="00:04:13.790" style="s2">the world sort of looks like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.440" end="00:04:15.079" style="s2">running backwards so it&#39;s hard to even</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.790" end="00:04:19.039" style="s2">imagine that it&#39;s been that way for</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.079" end="00:04:20.570" style="s2">decades prior but this decade certainly</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.039" end="00:04:24.710" style="s2">feels like it&#39;s going there&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.570" end="00:04:28.400" style="s2">be some collision between the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.710" end="00:04:34.220" style="s2">fresh traded emerging game be tights and</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.400" end="00:04:36.470" style="s2">the sort of entrenched game a leaders um</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.220" end="00:04:38.570" style="s2">the whole point about the the whole</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.470" end="00:04:41.479" style="s2">point about the metaphor is we can&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.570" end="00:04:42.950" style="s2">can&#39;t win by playing the game that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.479" end="00:04:45.230" style="s2">right and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.950" end="00:04:47.180" style="s2">my way of trying to understand what it</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.230" end="00:04:48.740" style="s2">is to not play their game and to shift</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.180" end="00:04:51.410" style="s2">over to in a totally different game</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.740" end="00:04:54.770" style="s2">shift the culture it&#39;s to steal the</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.410" end="00:04:56.870" style="s2">culture and the way to do that the way</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.770" end="00:04:58.790" style="s2">we right the only thing I can get from</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.870" end="00:05:00.710" style="s2">history that&#39;s been able to do that our</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.790" end="00:05:05.360" style="s2">religion but for reasons that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.710" end="00:05:06.950" style="s2">articulated I don&#39;t want not personally</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.360" end="00:05:09.260" style="s2">I mean in terms of the functionality I</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.950" end="00:05:12.080" style="s2">don&#39;t think the standard model the axial</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.260" end="00:05:13.280" style="s2">age model of religion is going to do</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.080" end="00:05:16.870" style="s2">what we need in order to steal the</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.280" end="00:05:16.870" style="s2">culture as deeply as we need to steal it</p>
