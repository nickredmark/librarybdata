<p begin="00:02:48.519" end="00:02:53.950" style="s2">many areas what&#39;s being said is that we</p>

<p begin="00:15:24.910" end="00:15:30.519" style="s2">culture of the media that it was mere</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.130" end="00:15:32.199" style="s2">mischaracterized that that way I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.519" end="00:15:35.079" style="s2">it shows that most journalists now</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.199" end="00:15:37.029" style="s2">aren&#39;t journalists or activists and they</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.079" end="00:15:38.860" style="s2">don&#39;t really care about the truth they</p>

<p begin="00:15:44.260" end="00:15:50.199" style="s2">narrative so if they have a certain you</p>

<p begin="00:15:55.690" end="00:15:59.709" style="s2">belong there or not and I think we saw</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.149" end="00:16:03.639" style="s2">this over and over and over after</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.709" end="00:16:05.980" style="s2">d&#39;amore with you know Trump and was the</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.639" end="00:16:08.620" style="s2">reaction to everybody who even sounded</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.980" end="00:16:11.170" style="s2">like they might vaguely support Trump or</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.620" end="00:16:12.579" style="s2">with brexit and everybody who sounded</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.170" end="00:16:16.750" style="s2">like they might even vaguely be</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.579" end="00:16:19.750" style="s2">sympathetic to brexit and so I realized</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.750" end="00:16:24.279" style="s2">we&#39;re not really living in a in a free</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.750" end="00:16:26.790" style="s2">speech society we&#39;re living in hegemony</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.279" end="00:16:29.709" style="s2">where journalists are doing this this</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.790" end="00:16:32.829" style="s2">ideological instruction and ideological</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.709" end="00:16:36.069" style="s2">capture and the only zones for freedom</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.829" end="00:16:39.970" style="s2">are the kind of IDW stuff or what you</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.069" end="00:16:43.360" style="s2">guys are doing YouTube I hope I hope</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.970" end="00:16:44.920" style="s2">YouTube stays relatively free and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.360" end="00:16:46.510" style="s2">what a again sort of coming back to the</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.920" end="00:16:49.120" style="s2">neurodiversity argument what I really</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.510" end="00:16:50.920" style="s2">love about that is that it reframes</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.120" end="00:16:53.410" style="s2">there&#39;s an ideological capture of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.920" end="00:16:55.180" style="s2">media as well did you get much pickup</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.410" end="00:16:57.399" style="s2">from it have you seen that argument</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.180" end="00:17:00.250" style="s2">getting much traction because it does</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.399" end="00:17:04.419" style="s2">seem that it&#39;s a very effective argument</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.250" end="00:17:07.299" style="s2">against the exclusion of certain voices</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.419" end="00:17:09.189" style="s2">in the media landscape yeah I think my</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.299" end="00:17:11.820" style="s2">neurodiversity he&#39;s got almost no</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.189" end="00:17:13.980" style="s2">traction precisely because it was a real</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.820" end="00:17:16.890" style="s2">good argument I think it would have been</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.980" end="00:17:19.500" style="s2">extremely awkward for journalists who</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.890" end="00:17:22.200" style="s2">read it and I know some read it to go oh</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.500" end="00:17:26.430" style="s2">my god the guys write existing speech</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.200" end="00:17:27.990" style="s2">codes are discriminatory I even did a</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.430" end="00:17:30.060" style="s2">follow-up piece called the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.990" end="00:17:33.480" style="s2">diversity case for free speech that was</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.060" end="00:17:36.080" style="s2">about how do you create let&#39;s say campus</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.480" end="00:17:39.150" style="s2">policies that are genuinely welcoming to</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.080" end="00:17:42.060" style="s2">grad students or faculty from other</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.150" end="00:17:44.610" style="s2">cultures Brazil China Iraq Japan</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.060" end="00:17:46.110" style="s2">whatever how do they come to America and</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.610" end="00:17:49.980" style="s2">actually learn what they&#39;re allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.110" end="00:17:53.490" style="s2">say can we perhaps provide a list to do</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.980" end="00:17:55.680" style="s2">topics that they can avoid can we give</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.490" end="00:17:58.620" style="s2">them good training for how to engage</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.680" end="00:18:02.520" style="s2">with American political arguments what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.620" end="00:18:04.440" style="s2">like okay here the the views in American</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.520" end="00:18:06.270" style="s2">society generally holds but here are the</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.440" end="00:18:09.090" style="s2">views on campus that you&#39;re only allowed</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.270" end="00:18:12.330" style="s2">to hold and that also I thought was a</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.090" end="00:18:15.690" style="s2">powerful argument it was also inclusive</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.330" end="00:18:17.130" style="s2">it was pro diversity it&#39;s like we should</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.690" end="00:18:19.190" style="s2">have grad students from other cultures</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.130" end="00:18:22.500" style="s2">we just shouldn&#39;t have a bait-and-switch</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.190" end="00:18:25.380" style="s2">where we go we&#39;re a free society oh wait</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.500" end="00:18:28.470" style="s2">but not about this issue because this is</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.380" end="00:18:33.600" style="s2">the paradox of the social justice left</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.470" end="00:18:37.680" style="s2">as well is that they love marginalized</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.600" end="00:18:41.610" style="s2">people poor people in the abstract but</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.680" end="00:18:42.780" style="s2">they actually hate their views yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.610" end="00:18:44.970" style="s2">it gets them into such an awkward</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.780" end="00:18:47.520" style="s2">corners it&#39;s almost hilarious like if</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.970" end="00:18:49.500" style="s2">you&#39;re teaching a human sexuality class</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.520" end="00:18:52.050" style="s2">and talking about meat choice and then</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.500" end="00:18:54.750" style="s2">maybe you have a young Indian woman in</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.050" end="00:18:56.910" style="s2">the audience say I&#39;m married actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.750" end="00:18:58.680" style="s2">it was an arranged marriage my parents</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.910" end="00:19:00.690" style="s2">found my husband for him I didn&#39;t meet</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.680" end="00:19:03.720" style="s2">him until the day of the wedding and you</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.690" end="00:19:05.430" style="s2">know what we&#39;re really happy the</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.720" end="00:19:09.660" style="s2">American women had can&#39;t even process</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.430" end="00:19:11.430" style="s2">that like you&#39;re patriarch Ilia pressed</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.660" end="00:19:16.470" style="s2">because it was arranged but you&#39;re happy</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.430" end="00:19:18.540" style="s2">so it&#39;s okay so like it&#39;s a suitor -</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.470" end="00:19:19.539" style="s2">it&#39;s a pseudo diversity they want they</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.540" end="00:19:22.749" style="s2">don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.539" end="00:19:25.149" style="s2">want people from different cultures and</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.749" end="00:19:27.779" style="s2">lifestyles and mating conditions to</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.149" end="00:19:30.549" style="s2">actually speak up about their experience</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.779" end="00:19:33.389" style="s2">they want to just impose their a little</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.549" end="00:19:37.299" style="s2">worldview on everything that happens and</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.389" end="00:19:40.419" style="s2">to the extent that you know a student</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.299" end="00:19:43.299" style="s2">from India kind of buys into what they</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.419" end="00:19:45.629" style="s2">want then like your honorary American</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.299" end="00:19:48.489" style="s2">leftist and that&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.629" end="00:19:54.489" style="s2">but if someone actually challenges what</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.489" end="00:19:58.479" style="s2">they&#39;re saying a their first instinct is</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.489" end="00:20:01.690" style="s2">ostracism and silencing and be they have</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.479" end="00:20:03.399" style="s2">no logical argument against a different</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.690" end="00:20:05.799" style="s2">culture you see there&#39;s quite a lot with</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.399" end="00:20:07.869" style="s2">the reaction to Coleman Hughes who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.799" end="00:20:11.729" style="s2">written quite a few pieces for Collette</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.869" end="00:20:16.119" style="s2">there&#39;s sort of this unspoken deal in</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.729" end="00:20:20.409" style="s2">these kind of social justice subcultures</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.119" end="00:20:22.019" style="s2">which is as a person of color you play a</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.409" end="00:20:24.519" style="s2">certain role and we will give you a</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.019" end="00:20:26.019" style="s2">hierarchical position but that role is</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.519" end="00:20:28.210" style="s2">to make us feel guilty about our white</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.019" end="00:20:31.059" style="s2">privilege it is to kind of to fit into a</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.210" end="00:20:33.429" style="s2">certain narrative and and there&#39;s a kind</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.059" end="00:20:35.409" style="s2">of devil&#39;s bargain there with with the</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.429" end="00:20:37.330" style="s2">people going into it but if that person</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.409" end="00:20:38.889" style="s2">refuses to play that game like Coleman</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.330" end="00:20:40.389" style="s2">Hughes for example with his pieces about</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.889" end="00:20:42.729" style="s2">Colette saying there are cultural</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.389" end="00:20:46.899" style="s2">reasons for black failure that are not</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.729" end="00:20:48.879" style="s2">entirely due to racism for example he</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.899" end="00:20:50.499" style="s2">they don&#39;t know what to do with it that</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.879" end="00:20:52.840" style="s2">someone as soon as someone comes up</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.499" end="00:20:54.580" style="s2">slips out of the script it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.840" end="00:20:56.249" style="s2">different conversation and no one really</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.580" end="00:20:59.919" style="s2">knows how to react</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.249" end="00:21:03.309" style="s2">yeah and that again you know illustrates</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.919" end="00:21:05.320" style="s2">that social justice left pays a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.309" end="00:21:07.659" style="s2">lip service to diversity but they they</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.320" end="00:21:10.210" style="s2">aren&#39;t actually capable of processing</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.659" end="00:21:14.320" style="s2">anybody with a kind of complicated</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.210" end="00:21:16.359" style="s2">patchwork of views you know maybe we we</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.320" end="00:21:19.720" style="s2">should step back from it and say maybe</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.359" end="00:21:22.059" style="s2">we don&#39;t want the social norms of</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.720" end="00:21:26.820" style="s2">communication to be set by a bunch of</p>

<p begin="00:21:26.849" end="00:21:30.820" style="s2">like maybe they should actually respect</p>
