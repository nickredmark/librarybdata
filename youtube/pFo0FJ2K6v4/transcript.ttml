<p begin="00:00:03.679" end="00:00:07.759" style="s2">hello everyone welcome to voices with</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.520" end="00:00:10.240" style="s2">verviki i&#39;m joined one more time</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.759" end="00:00:11.360" style="s2">and paul probably not the last time uh</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.240" end="00:00:15.440" style="s2">by my good friend</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.360" end="00:00:18.400" style="s2">and colleague uh lehman pascal who has</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.440" end="00:00:20.320" style="s2">generated so many wonderful uh dialogues</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.400" end="00:00:21.760" style="s2">on voices with raviki so</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.320" end="00:00:24.800" style="s2">uh welcome back layman it&#39;s good to have</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.760" end="00:00:26.560" style="s2">you here again hi john lovely to be here</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.800" end="00:00:28.000" style="s2">uh i think last time we&#39;ve sort of been</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.560" end="00:00:29.920" style="s2">thinking about this as a</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.000" end="00:00:31.119" style="s2">as my overarching series with some</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.920" end="00:00:32.960" style="s2">themed stuff</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.119" end="00:00:34.480" style="s2">i&#39;m thinking of the overarching theme as</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.960" end="00:00:35.760" style="s2">something like post-metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.480" end="00:00:39.040" style="s2">spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.760" end="00:00:42.239" style="s2">right so last time we delved into beauty</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.040" end="00:00:45.360" style="s2">and we talked last time at the end about</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.239" end="00:00:47.760" style="s2">um i guess the transposition of</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.360" end="00:00:48.719" style="s2">optimal grip skills into domains like</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.760" end="00:00:51.520" style="s2">politics</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.719" end="00:00:52.879" style="s2">yes yeah that&#39;s a tricky one to think</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.520" end="00:00:53.920" style="s2">out so i think we should spend some time</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.879" end="00:00:56.559" style="s2">on that</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.920" end="00:00:57.360" style="s2">yeah i i i think that&#39;s that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.559" end="00:01:00.559" style="s2">topic</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.360" end="00:01:01.920" style="s2">it&#39;s very pertinent um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.559" end="00:01:05.119" style="s2">we&#39;ll have to go carefully because of</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.920" end="00:01:08.159" style="s2">course this is a topic that is</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.119" end="00:01:10.560" style="s2">fraught with reactivity on people&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.159" end="00:01:12.000" style="s2">and that reactivity i think has been</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.560" end="00:01:14.640" style="s2">exacerbated by</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.000" end="00:01:16.320" style="s2">the past few months so how would you</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.640" end="00:01:17.759" style="s2">like to begin though</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.320" end="00:01:19.200" style="s2">i think if we talk at a high enough</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.759" end="00:01:22.000" style="s2">level no one will have any idea what</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.200" end="00:01:22.000" style="s2">we&#39;re saying and that</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.119" end="00:01:28.320" style="s2">i&#39;ve been trying to think about what i</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.400" end="00:01:30.720" style="s2">mean by politics and i suppose in</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.320" end="00:01:33.200" style="s2">general i would say it&#39;s the art of</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.720" end="00:01:34.960" style="s2">um embodied distributed intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.200" end="00:01:38.079" style="s2">it&#39;s how we get together</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.960" end="00:01:38.720" style="s2">to make decisions about how to be and</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.079" end="00:01:41.680" style="s2">that can be</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.720" end="00:01:43.360" style="s2">smarter or dumber in a sense and then i</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.680" end="00:01:45.920" style="s2">would put that in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.360" end="00:01:47.759" style="s2">in the context of religion which i would</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.920" end="00:01:50.399" style="s2">think of as a super political or</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.759" end="00:01:52.320" style="s2">metapolitical approach to</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.399" end="00:01:54.079" style="s2">recollecting the skills that build</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.320" end="00:01:55.040" style="s2">social integration and coherent</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.079" end="00:01:57.439" style="s2">mobilization</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.040" end="00:01:59.680" style="s2">spirits across the domains of culture in</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.439" end="00:02:02.880" style="s2">any epoch</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.680" end="00:02:05.119" style="s2">so i think i i&#39;m i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.880" end="00:02:06.479" style="s2">online with you the problem for me is i</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.119" end="00:02:08.479" style="s2">have two different conceptions of</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.479" end="00:02:10.239" style="s2">politics in my mind the first</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.479" end="00:02:11.840" style="s2">is very uh similar to what you said i</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.239" end="00:02:14.800" style="s2">have aristotle&#39;s notion of</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.840" end="00:02:15.680" style="s2">politics as you know remember aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.800" end="00:02:18.000" style="s2">says that</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.680" end="00:02:19.040" style="s2">man is inherently a social or a</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.000" end="00:02:21.360" style="s2">political</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.040" end="00:02:22.959" style="s2">being human beings i should say he was</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.360" end="00:02:27.280" style="s2">sexist i&#39;ve tried not to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.959" end="00:02:30.879" style="s2">um and uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.280" end="00:02:35.040" style="s2">i think that broadly is right uh i i i</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.879" end="00:02:38.080" style="s2">but i&#39;m reminded of nietzsche&#39;s uh uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.040" end="00:02:40.000" style="s2">uh humorous um and ironic twist on that</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.080" end="00:02:42.879" style="s2">aristotle says that in order to live</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.000" end="00:02:45.680" style="s2">alone one must be either a god or an</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.879" end="00:02:46.480" style="s2">animal but one can be both a philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.680" end="00:02:48.640" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.480" end="00:02:49.760" style="s2">so i wonder where that puts us in this</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.640" end="00:02:53.920" style="s2">discussion</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.760" end="00:02:54.319" style="s2">but so i think that um i tend to reserve</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.920" end="00:02:58.480" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.319" end="00:03:00.640" style="s2">but that definition of politics</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.480" end="00:03:02.640" style="s2">i&#39;m not so happy with applying although</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.640" end="00:03:04.879" style="s2">i think you&#39;re right to use it that way</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.640" end="00:03:06.959" style="s2">it has a bonafide heritage i think that</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.879" end="00:03:07.840" style="s2">the common sense uh everyday sense of</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.959" end="00:03:09.760" style="s2">politics</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.840" end="00:03:12.400" style="s2">is much more limited to er than what</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.760" end="00:03:15.360" style="s2">aristotle said i think for most people</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.400" end="00:03:16.080" style="s2">what politics is about is not something</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.360" end="00:03:19.200" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.080" end="00:03:22.640" style="s2">um the systemic management</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.200" end="00:03:24.159" style="s2">of distributed in cognition uh within</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.640" end="00:03:24.959" style="s2">something like a meta meeting system of</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.159" end="00:03:27.599" style="s2">religion</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.959" end="00:03:28.640" style="s2">um in fact i i would propose that for</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.599" end="00:03:31.040" style="s2">most people</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.640" end="00:03:32.720" style="s2">uh myself included nowadays that would</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.040" end="00:03:35.200" style="s2">be the word culture</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.720" end="00:03:36.239" style="s2">um and and the association to</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.200" end="00:03:39.280" style="s2">cultivation</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.239" end="00:03:42.879" style="s2">and to cult is readily apparent right</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.280" end="00:03:44.480" style="s2">um whereas politics i feel</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.879" end="00:03:47.599" style="s2">uh for many people now when they hear</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.480" end="00:03:51.200" style="s2">that term they&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.599" end="00:03:53.760" style="s2">the principles of governance so for them</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.200" end="00:03:54.560" style="s2">politics the locus of politics is more</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.760" end="00:03:58.959" style="s2">properly</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.560" end="00:04:00.560" style="s2">the state as opposed to the culture</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.959" end="00:04:02.640" style="s2">now that might be something you want to</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.560" end="00:04:03.200" style="s2">challenge and but i&#39;m just bringing that</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.640" end="00:04:05.439" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.200" end="00:04:06.560" style="s2">as you know i think there&#39;s two senses</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.439" end="00:04:08.400" style="s2">of the word politics</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.560" end="00:04:10.319" style="s2">the one that i think you&#39;re invoking is</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.400" end="00:04:12.000" style="s2">a bona fide one and like i said it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.319" end="00:04:14.480" style="s2">clearly found in aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.000" end="00:04:15.599" style="s2">but i don&#39;t think it is what people</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.480" end="00:04:18.160" style="s2">readily hear</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.599" end="00:04:20.799" style="s2">when they hear politics today because</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.160" end="00:04:20.799" style="s2">most people</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.000" end="00:04:25.680" style="s2">that&#39;s too bold many people that i&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.479" end="00:04:28.160" style="s2">discussion with</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.680" end="00:04:29.919" style="s2">feel that politics is something that</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.160" end="00:04:30.240" style="s2">they can have nothing to do with they</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.919" end="00:04:32.240" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.240" end="00:04:33.680" style="s2">it can be their life can be basically</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.240" end="00:04:35.600" style="s2">free from politics</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.680" end="00:04:37.360" style="s2">and they&#39;re very suspicious of people</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.600" end="00:04:39.280" style="s2">who have a political agenda</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.360" end="00:04:40.479" style="s2">so that obviously means that they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.280" end="00:04:42.400" style="s2">thinking of politics</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.479" end="00:04:43.759" style="s2">in that first definition because the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.400" end="00:04:45.360" style="s2">first thing you talk about they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.759" end="00:04:46.400" style="s2">escape from there is no place where you</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.360" end="00:04:48.400" style="s2">can get free from</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.400" end="00:04:49.680" style="s2">distributed cognition and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.400" end="00:04:52.639" style="s2">aristotle&#39;s point</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.680" end="00:04:54.400" style="s2">or culture um so given that you have</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.639" end="00:04:55.120" style="s2">these two definitions do you prefer the</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.400" end="00:04:56.960" style="s2">ancient one</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.120" end="00:04:58.880" style="s2">over the more modern one are you trying</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.960" end="00:05:00.479" style="s2">to negotiate a relationship between them</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.880" end="00:05:02.479" style="s2">in your proposal</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.479" end="00:05:04.960" style="s2">i you know looking at people with those</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.479" end="00:05:07.039" style="s2">two attitudes let&#39;s say about politics</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.960" end="00:05:08.400" style="s2">um i&#39;ve got kind of three opinions i</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.039" end="00:05:09.199" style="s2">think the first opinion that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.400" end="00:05:12.240" style="s2">pertinent to us</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.199" end="00:05:14.160" style="s2">is people might just not see how the</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.240" end="00:05:14.400" style="s2">skills that apply to the domains they</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.160" end="00:05:16.639" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.400" end="00:05:18.560" style="s2">interested in also apply to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.639" end="00:05:20.639" style="s2">political domain am i just not</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.560" end="00:05:23.520" style="s2">seeing that connection i do think</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.639" end="00:05:25.919" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of people who</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.520" end="00:05:26.880" style="s2">have this sort of the negative affect</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.919" end="00:05:28.560" style="s2">and distanced</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.880" end="00:05:30.400" style="s2">relationship to politics as if it was</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.560" end="00:05:32.880" style="s2">the domain of some other</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.400" end="00:05:34.960" style="s2">and i th that that&#39;s a political problem</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.880" end="00:05:37.199" style="s2">in the organization of the culture</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.960" end="00:05:38.320" style="s2">is that we disown our relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.199" end="00:05:41.120" style="s2">the political</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.320" end="00:05:42.880" style="s2">well we see it as a viable intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.120" end="00:05:44.320" style="s2">that we can cultivate and that may be</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.880" end="00:05:46.479" style="s2">one of the reasons we&#39;re not getting</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.320" end="00:05:47.440" style="s2">very far politically is that most people</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.479" end="00:05:50.160" style="s2">have opted out</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.440" end="00:05:51.039" style="s2">emotionally from that domain yes but we</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.160" end="00:05:52.880" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.039" end="00:05:54.479" style="s2">you know we can say what is politics but</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.880" end="00:05:55.919" style="s2">we can also say what should it be what</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.479" end="00:05:58.800" style="s2">would we like it to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.919" end="00:05:59.759" style="s2">right right in my mind the goal is</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.800" end="00:06:02.319" style="s2">something like a</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.759" end="00:06:04.160" style="s2">wisdom civilization right right so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.319" end="00:06:04.800" style="s2">going to skew all definitions in that</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.160" end="00:06:08.319" style="s2">direction</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.800" end="00:06:10.720" style="s2">regardless of how viably justified that</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.319" end="00:06:12.160" style="s2">is by history</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.720" end="00:06:14.000" style="s2">and i&#39;m going to think about that in two</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.160" end="00:06:15.759" style="s2">ways and one is</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.000" end="00:06:18.720" style="s2">what are this how do we create the</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.759" end="00:06:20.400" style="s2">supportive conditions in the culture</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.720" end="00:06:22.479" style="s2">partly through the organizing principles</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.400" end="00:06:24.400" style="s2">of governance in order to</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.479" end="00:06:26.160" style="s2">allow people to flourish in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.400" end="00:06:28.800" style="s2">direction of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.160" end="00:06:30.560" style="s2">also what can we do at the structural</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.800" end="00:06:32.639" style="s2">systemic level of society that is</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.560" end="00:06:34.560" style="s2">analogous to individual wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.639" end="00:06:38.240" style="s2">cultivation procedures</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.560" end="00:06:41.360" style="s2">right right so i take it to mean then</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.240" end="00:06:44.639" style="s2">that um the</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.360" end="00:06:45.759" style="s2">vehicle of these facilitations will not</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.639" end="00:06:49.440" style="s2">exclusively be</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.759" end="00:06:52.479" style="s2">the state that there are other um</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.440" end="00:06:55.360" style="s2">institutions or um</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.479" end="00:06:56.720" style="s2">subsystems of the culture that you also</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.360" end="00:06:58.240" style="s2">think will be invoked</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.720" end="00:06:59.919" style="s2">in this kind of political change that</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.240" end="00:07:01.599" style="s2">you&#39;re proposing is that correct</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.919" end="00:07:03.440" style="s2">yeah i think we need to generalize the</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.599" end="00:07:05.120" style="s2">meaning and there are ways in which</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.440" end="00:07:07.199" style="s2">everyone already has done that right</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.120" end="00:07:09.360" style="s2">everyone knows about office politics</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.199" end="00:07:11.840" style="s2">that&#39;s not the state right so wherever</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.360" end="00:07:13.599" style="s2">there&#39;s negotiations between people</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.840" end="00:07:15.280" style="s2">about how we get things done that</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.599" end="00:07:17.039" style="s2">becomes political because</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.280" end="00:07:18.720" style="s2">you have to figure out a principle of</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.039" end="00:07:21.520" style="s2">collective decision making and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.720" end="00:07:23.919" style="s2">enact it that&#39;s politics</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.520" end="00:07:25.199" style="s2">so you so for you politics is therefore</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.919" end="00:07:28.000" style="s2">basically germane</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.199" end="00:07:28.479" style="s2">to the collective decision-making that</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.000" end="00:07:31.120" style="s2">gives</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.479" end="00:07:31.759" style="s2">some kind of government or regulation to</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.120" end="00:07:33.440" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.759" end="00:07:35.759" style="s2">to the problem-solving of distributed</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.440" end="00:07:38.800" style="s2">cognition is that a fair</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.759" end="00:07:38.800" style="s2">that&#39;s very fair yes</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.960" end="00:07:42.319" style="s2">so that would mean that even two people</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.960" end="00:07:42.880" style="s2">having a conversation about where</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.319" end="00:07:45.360" style="s2">they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.880" end="00:07:46.879" style="s2">have dinner would in that sense be</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.360" end="00:07:49.440" style="s2">political</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.879" end="00:07:50.160" style="s2">yes i think that&#39;s a i mean that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.440" end="00:07:51.840" style="s2">outlier</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.160" end="00:07:53.599" style="s2">in terms of most people&#39;s feelings about</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.840" end="00:07:54.560" style="s2">the subject but i think it&#39;s a viable</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.599" end="00:07:57.599" style="s2">part of that</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.560" end="00:07:58.000" style="s2">and i think it&#39;s important to view it</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.599" end="00:07:59.919" style="s2">that way</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.000" end="00:08:01.280" style="s2">because the more you can see the</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.919" end="00:08:03.680" style="s2">opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.280" end="00:08:04.639" style="s2">for how interpersonal decisions can be</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.680" end="00:08:06.639" style="s2">made better</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.639" end="00:08:08.000" style="s2">the more insight you have into how that</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.639" end="00:08:11.199" style="s2">can be deployed</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.000" end="00:08:15.039" style="s2">at scale so therefore</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.199" end="00:08:17.360" style="s2">is is there a continuum between the</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.039" end="00:08:18.319" style="s2">a continuum in the sense of a continuity</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.360" end="00:08:21.599" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.319" end="00:08:24.720" style="s2">uh principles uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.599" end="00:08:25.759" style="s2">design principles um between the small</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.720" end="00:08:28.400" style="s2">scale</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.759" end="00:08:29.280" style="s2">interactions like say like we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.400" end="00:08:32.399" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.280" end="00:08:33.200" style="s2">and the large scale uh processes of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.399" end="00:08:35.200" style="s2">state</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.200" end="00:08:36.880" style="s2">do you see that it was on a continuum so</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.200" end="00:08:39.760" style="s2">that the absolutely yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.880" end="00:08:42.320" style="s2">oh i see the simplest and most commonly</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.760" end="00:08:44.800" style="s2">pointed out aspect of that continuum is</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.320" end="00:08:46.720" style="s2">the parallel between political views and</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.800" end="00:08:48.399" style="s2">domestic organization</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.720" end="00:08:50.720" style="s2">right everybody from wilhelm wright to</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.399" end="00:08:52.240" style="s2">george lakoff has pointed out how the</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.720" end="00:08:54.240" style="s2">the way the kids are raised in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.240" end="00:08:56.160" style="s2">household sets up the metaphorical</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.240" end="00:08:58.240" style="s2">structure of how they think the system</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.160" end="00:09:00.240" style="s2">should be laid out nationally</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.240" end="00:09:01.519" style="s2">and all right so some of those layouts</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.240" end="00:09:03.920" style="s2">are smarter than others</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.519" end="00:09:05.440" style="s2">some are more flexible than others yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.920" end="00:09:07.440" style="s2">there&#39;s that and there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.440" end="00:09:09.200" style="s2">some interesting empirical data on that</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.440" end="00:09:12.480" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.200" end="00:09:13.680" style="s2">trying to determine um sort of people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.480" end="00:09:16.240" style="s2">political allegiance</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.680" end="00:09:17.680" style="s2">if you ask them directly that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.240" end="00:09:19.279" style="s2">good mark but if you ask them about</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.680" end="00:09:21.040" style="s2">their attitudes to parenting</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.279" end="00:09:24.240" style="s2">those are that&#39;s often a very good</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.040" end="00:09:25.920" style="s2">predictor of their sort of true</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.240" end="00:09:28.959" style="s2">political leanings</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.920" end="00:09:29.360" style="s2">um so that so there&#39;s what i&#39;m saying is</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.959" end="00:09:31.760" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.360" end="00:09:34.080" style="s2">that metaphor is not just sort of uh a</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.760" end="00:09:35.839" style="s2">cultural ornament or a faceless</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.080" end="00:09:37.120" style="s2">it seems to point to something of a</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.839" end="00:09:38.320" style="s2">predictive relationship</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.120" end="00:09:40.160" style="s2">and that would tend to support your</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.320" end="00:09:41.600" style="s2">proposal of a continuum</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.160" end="00:09:44.640" style="s2">so the reason why i&#39;m asking all of this</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.600" end="00:09:48.080" style="s2">is you know is i i generally</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.640" end="00:09:51.360" style="s2">i i i generally try not to get involved</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.080" end="00:09:53.680" style="s2">with the debates between right and left</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.360" end="00:09:54.560" style="s2">uh because i think there are deep</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.680" end="00:09:57.600" style="s2">problems</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.560" end="00:09:59.360" style="s2">uh on both sides that um</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.600" end="00:10:00.320" style="s2">it&#39;s similar to the thing i do with</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.360" end="00:10:02.000" style="s2">between the realists and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.320" end="00:10:02.959" style="s2">anti-realists or between the theists and</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.000" end="00:10:05.120" style="s2">the atheists</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.959" end="00:10:06.800" style="s2">um i tend to find that there&#39;s shared</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.120" end="00:10:07.519" style="s2">problematic presuppositions on both</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.800" end="00:10:09.519" style="s2">sides</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.519" end="00:10:11.600" style="s2">that i want to challenge now part of my</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.519" end="00:10:13.040" style="s2">understanding is that metamodernism also</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.600" end="00:10:16.839" style="s2">wants to challenge those</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.040" end="00:10:18.000" style="s2">shared presuppositions so um that&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.839" end="00:10:21.120" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.000" end="00:10:21.680" style="s2">i often use and zach stein used the same</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.120" end="00:10:24.880" style="s2">term</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.680" end="00:10:27.360" style="s2">uh for me i have to talk about um</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.880" end="00:10:28.880" style="s2">you know that i&#39;m considered i&#39;m sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.360" end="00:10:30.720" style="s2">concerned with the meta</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.880" end="00:10:32.160" style="s2">uh political i&#39;m concerned with what are</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.720" end="00:10:33.200" style="s2">the what are the conditions of</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.160" end="00:10:36.000" style="s2">possibility</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.200" end="00:10:36.800" style="s2">for the kinds of collective problem</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.000" end="00:10:39.279" style="s2">solving</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.800" end="00:10:41.680" style="s2">uh that we need in order to bring about</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.279" end="00:10:44.839" style="s2">as you said a wisdom culture</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.680" end="00:10:47.200" style="s2">so i think that now that you have</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.839" end="00:10:49.600" style="s2">specified and stipulated how you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.200" end="00:10:50.240" style="s2">using the word political i&#39;m fine with</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.600" end="00:10:53.440" style="s2">that because</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.240" end="00:10:54.959" style="s2">uh it aligns with um</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.440" end="00:10:56.480" style="s2">i mean you can have whatever opinion you</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.959" end="00:10:57.279" style="s2">want that&#39;s not what i mean what i mean</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.480" end="00:11:00.000" style="s2">is i think</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.279" end="00:11:02.720" style="s2">we have common ground uh where we can</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.000" end="00:11:06.079" style="s2">have this discussion</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.720" end="00:11:07.680" style="s2">yeah i um i mean instinctively</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.079" end="00:11:09.519" style="s2">i would call myself something like a</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.680" end="00:11:11.600" style="s2">meta progressive but i think a meta</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.519" end="00:11:13.279" style="s2">frame is necessary no matter what</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.600" end="00:11:14.959" style="s2">and there&#39;s a couple different ways to</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.279" end="00:11:18.240" style="s2">approach that you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.959" end="00:11:20.800" style="s2">in the integral theory there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.240" end="00:11:22.240" style="s2">necessity to unpack stages or</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.800" end="00:11:24.959" style="s2">developmental levels</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.240" end="00:11:26.240" style="s2">as well as a left right polarization and</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.959" end="00:11:28.640" style="s2">then to think of left and right as</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.240" end="00:11:31.920" style="s2">something operating at various</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.640" end="00:11:34.240" style="s2">nested epistemic levels</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.920" end="00:11:36.079" style="s2">so that&#39;s one thing and then the meta</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.240" end="00:11:37.839" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.079" end="00:11:39.680" style="s2">i think one of the things meta-modern</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.839" end="00:11:40.560" style="s2">brings in is a much more nuanced</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.680" end="00:11:42.480" style="s2">critique</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.560" end="00:11:44.560" style="s2">of the underlying metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.480" end="00:11:46.959" style="s2">assumptions of modernity</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.560" end="00:11:48.720" style="s2">which include our standard political</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.959" end="00:11:50.560" style="s2">spectrum of left and right</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.720" end="00:11:51.920" style="s2">which is opposed to us like it&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.560" end="00:11:55.440" style="s2">fundamental options</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.920" end="00:11:56.000" style="s2">but really that&#39;s part of the polarized</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.440" end="00:11:58.480" style="s2">operating</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.000" end="00:11:59.839" style="s2">procedure of the standard model of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.480" end="00:12:02.959" style="s2">last few centuries</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.839" end="00:12:05.600" style="s2">well that&#39;s exactly it i i the way uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.959" end="00:12:06.320" style="s2">i think you said it very well the um</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.600" end="00:12:09.680" style="s2">shared</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.320" end="00:12:12.240" style="s2">implicit epistemology and metaphysics of</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.680" end="00:12:12.880" style="s2">the so-called left and right um i think</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.240" end="00:12:14.480" style="s2">and i</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.880" end="00:12:16.399" style="s2">they&#39;re you&#39;re right they are both born</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.480" end="00:12:18.480" style="s2">out of modernity clearly</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.399" end="00:12:20.079" style="s2">and deeply and continuously dependent on</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.480" end="00:12:22.320" style="s2">that and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.079" end="00:12:24.399" style="s2">uh there are important shared</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.320" end="00:12:27.200" style="s2">presuppositions that need to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.399" end="00:12:28.160" style="s2">challenged there i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.200" end="00:12:31.680" style="s2">essential</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.160" end="00:12:33.920" style="s2">i think also a particular recent turn</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.680" end="00:12:34.880" style="s2">uh that has exacerbated by social media</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.920" end="00:12:38.560" style="s2">that has now</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.880" end="00:12:40.079" style="s2">become at least de facto probably not</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.560" end="00:12:41.760" style="s2">the juror but a de facto shared</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.079" end="00:12:44.639" style="s2">presupposition which is</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.760" end="00:12:45.120" style="s2">that we have forgot that the left right</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.639" end="00:12:48.079" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.120" end="00:12:49.680" style="s2">was supposed to be a form of opponent</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.079" end="00:12:50.720" style="s2">processing a way to facilitate</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.680" end="00:12:53.120" style="s2">self-correction</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.720" end="00:12:55.040" style="s2">within distributed cognition and that</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.120" end="00:12:57.600" style="s2">our ultimate allegiance was</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.040" end="00:12:58.800" style="s2">to the distributed cognitions</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.600" end="00:13:01.920" style="s2">functionality to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.800" end="00:13:02.560" style="s2">to the process but that has degenerated</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.920" end="00:13:05.440" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.560" end="00:13:06.480" style="s2">a a cultural cognitive grammar of a</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.440" end="00:13:08.959" style="s2">zero-sum game</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.480" end="00:13:10.880" style="s2">and adversarial processing and winners</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.959" end="00:13:11.839" style="s2">and losers and destroying the other side</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.880" end="00:13:14.880" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.839" end="00:13:17.120" style="s2">so the whole idea of like the</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.880" end="00:13:18.160" style="s2">idea of dewey that you&#39;ve got a deep</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.120" end="00:13:19.920" style="s2">interconnection between the</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.160" end="00:13:21.519" style="s2">self-correcting processes of science and</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.920" end="00:13:25.200" style="s2">the self-correcting processes</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.519" end="00:13:29.279" style="s2">of democracy has been lost the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.200" end="00:13:31.200" style="s2">um your your commitment is always</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.279" end="00:13:32.560" style="s2">to the country or at least to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.200" end="00:13:34.560" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.560" end="00:13:36.079" style="s2">of democracy and science within</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.560" end="00:13:38.720" style="s2">distributed cognition</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.079" end="00:13:39.680" style="s2">so that&#39;s that&#39;s a modernist thing to</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.720" end="00:13:42.560" style="s2">say i get that</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.680" end="00:13:43.760" style="s2">what i&#39;m saying is even that modernist</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.560" end="00:13:46.480" style="s2">uh presupposition</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.760" end="00:13:47.279" style="s2">is now i think been largely discarded</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.480" end="00:13:49.519" style="s2">and we are now</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.279" end="00:13:51.120" style="s2">into no self-correction within</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.519" end="00:13:51.680" style="s2">distributed cognition is not what this</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.120" end="00:13:55.360" style="s2">is about</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.680" end="00:13:57.600" style="s2">this is about me winning and you losing</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.360" end="00:13:58.560" style="s2">because there&#39;s a zero-sum game and i</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.600" end="00:14:00.959" style="s2">need to uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.560" end="00:14:05.120" style="s2">try and hold on to whatever power and</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.959" end="00:14:07.959" style="s2">privilege access to the state gives me</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.120" end="00:14:09.199" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s two ways in which a</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.959" end="00:14:11.519" style="s2">trans-modern</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.199" end="00:14:12.240" style="s2">critique or trans-modern politics is</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.519" end="00:14:15.360" style="s2">necessary</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.240" end="00:14:17.519" style="s2">one of them is to say there are inherent</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.360" end="00:14:20.639" style="s2">problems within the logic of the modern</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.519" end="00:14:24.160" style="s2">apparatus the modern way of organizing</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.639" end="00:14:26.560" style="s2">and that that uh homeostatically ensures</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.160" end="00:14:28.399" style="s2">its ongoing survival through opponent</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.560" end="00:14:31.920" style="s2">processing when it&#39;s working well</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.399" end="00:14:34.000" style="s2">it keeps itself from changing by having</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.920" end="00:14:34.720" style="s2">two apparent directions to go in all the</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.000" end="00:14:36.160" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.720" end="00:14:38.079" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s not just left and</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.160" end="00:14:39.600" style="s2">right politics that&#39;s you know the</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.079" end="00:14:41.760" style="s2">prosecutor and the defender</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.600" end="00:14:43.600" style="s2">and it&#39;s the x y axis of the cartesian</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.760" end="00:14:44.800" style="s2">grid right down the line with this</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.600" end="00:14:48.160" style="s2">polarized</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.800" end="00:14:51.040" style="s2">nuke the other side is like you say</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.160" end="00:14:51.680" style="s2">even by its own metrics modernity is</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.040" end="00:14:55.600" style="s2">failing</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.680" end="00:14:58.079" style="s2">to be that and therefore also requires a</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.600" end="00:14:59.760" style="s2">trans-modern politics to correct its</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.079" end="00:15:02.320" style="s2">collapse</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.760" end="00:15:03.920" style="s2">thank you layman you you uh you put</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.320" end="00:15:06.240" style="s2">those two together and said that</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.920" end="00:15:07.920" style="s2">very well that was very succinct and</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.240" end="00:15:11.519" style="s2">very clear thank you for that</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.920" end="00:15:14.320" style="s2">so that means we now have a proper</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.519" end="00:15:14.959" style="s2">philosophic philosophical problem we can</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.320" end="00:15:17.519" style="s2">tackle</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.959" end="00:15:18.320" style="s2">which is well what are those two trans</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.519" end="00:15:20.720" style="s2">modern</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.320" end="00:15:21.360" style="s2">moves or i mean or what are the two</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.720" end="00:15:23.199" style="s2">kinds</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.360" end="00:15:25.440" style="s2">maybe there are they each form a set of</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.199" end="00:15:28.399" style="s2">things two kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.440" end="00:15:30.560" style="s2">uh trans-modern uh political moves you</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.399" end="00:15:32.079" style="s2">want to see happen</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.560" end="00:15:34.079" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s interesting to look at it from</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.079" end="00:15:36.000" style="s2">those two angles because though on</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.079" end="00:15:37.279" style="s2">on the in terms of modernity&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.000" end="00:15:39.519" style="s2">corruption let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.279" end="00:15:41.279" style="s2">yeah in terms of the sub-systems of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.519" end="00:15:43.680" style="s2">modern civilization</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.279" end="00:15:45.199" style="s2">buying with each other and destabilizing</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.680" end="00:15:47.600" style="s2">and therefore opening up</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.199" end="00:15:48.959" style="s2">the regressive move back to pre-modern</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.600" end="00:15:51.839" style="s2">cultural trends</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.959" end="00:15:53.680" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s come about in the form of</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.839" end="00:15:54.000" style="s2">several crises you know you might even</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.680" end="00:15:55.600" style="s2">argue</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.000" end="00:15:57.160" style="s2">as some people have that every couple of</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.600" end="00:15:59.920" style="s2">decades modernity</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.160" end="00:16:01.519" style="s2">self-sabotages yeah requires some kind</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.920" end="00:16:03.920" style="s2">of progressive political</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.519" end="00:16:04.720" style="s2">band-aid like in the new deal for</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.920" end="00:16:07.519" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.720" end="00:16:08.880" style="s2">right modernity fails on its own terms</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.519" end="00:16:11.920" style="s2">and then has to have a</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.880" end="00:16:12.560" style="s2">pseudo socialist facelift right right</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.920" end="00:16:14.480" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.560" end="00:16:16.320" style="s2">so there&#39;s that sense in which people</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.480" end="00:16:18.800" style="s2">might even argue that right that bernie</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.320" end="00:16:21.519" style="s2">sanders is the real savior of capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.800" end="00:16:23.519" style="s2">because if you made those european style</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.519" end="00:16:25.279" style="s2">upgrades to the social safety net</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.519" end="00:16:27.040" style="s2">you&#39;d have a much more flourishing</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.279" end="00:16:30.079" style="s2">modern capitalist economy</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.040" end="00:16:31.199" style="s2">right right on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.079" end="00:16:32.720" style="s2">that&#39;s going to have inherent</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.199" end="00:16:33.920" style="s2">limitations and those inherent</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.720" end="00:16:35.839" style="s2">limitations are</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.920" end="00:16:37.360" style="s2">you know well critiqued by people for</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.839" end="00:16:40.199" style="s2">the last 200 years</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.360" end="00:16:41.519" style="s2">right they mainly take the form of</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.199" end="00:16:44.399" style="s2">marginalization or</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.519" end="00:16:45.920" style="s2">every kind of excluded externality</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.399" end="00:16:47.279" style="s2">there&#39;s whole population groups we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.920" end="00:16:49.279" style="s2">not looking at there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.279" end="00:16:50.560" style="s2">ecological background conditions we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.279" end="00:16:53.120" style="s2">not looking at there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.560" end="00:16:55.120" style="s2">huge factors in which the gdp does not</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.120" end="00:16:56.399" style="s2">indicate how well the economy is doing</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.120" end="00:16:59.519" style="s2">exactly exactly</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.399" end="00:17:00.639" style="s2">the trans-modern politics in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.519" end="00:17:03.440" style="s2">would be an attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.639" end="00:17:04.160" style="s2">fold in what&#39;s currently external to the</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.440" end="00:17:07.280" style="s2">modern</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.160" end="00:17:09.760" style="s2">metrics right uh so</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.280" end="00:17:11.199" style="s2">the the part of that that i have some</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.760" end="00:17:14.559" style="s2">understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.199" end="00:17:15.919" style="s2">the parts are um like you said the way</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.559" end="00:17:19.360" style="s2">modernity has us</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.919" end="00:17:23.360" style="s2">disembeded uh from uh from</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.360" end="00:17:25.600" style="s2">history and uh ecology um</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.360" end="00:17:26.720" style="s2">uh and people say but his republic is</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.600" end="00:17:28.640" style="s2">all about history no</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.720" end="00:17:29.760" style="s2">it&#39;s not about history again in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.640" end="00:17:32.799" style="s2">sense of</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.760" end="00:17:33.520" style="s2">uh understanding like what heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.799" end="00:17:34.960" style="s2">talks about</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.520" end="00:17:36.480" style="s2">an understanding of the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.960" end="00:17:37.360" style="s2">cognitive grammar and how it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.480" end="00:17:40.880" style="s2">evolving</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.360" end="00:17:41.679" style="s2">um uh modernity suffers from the end of</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.880" end="00:17:44.320" style="s2">history</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.679" end="00:17:45.679" style="s2">myth that it is the culminating way of</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.320" end="00:17:47.039" style="s2">understanding everything</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.679" end="00:17:48.880" style="s2">and therefore it doesn&#39;t need to pay</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.039" end="00:17:49.600" style="s2">attention to previous ways of</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.880" end="00:17:51.520" style="s2">understanding</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.600" end="00:17:53.039" style="s2">or they and therefore look for new ways</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.520" end="00:17:54.000" style="s2">so i think i agree with you</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.039" end="00:17:55.679" style="s2">that&#39;s what i mean by how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.000" end="00:17:56.559" style="s2">disembedded from its history it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.679" end="00:17:59.679" style="s2">obviously deep</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.559" end="00:18:03.280" style="s2">deeply disembedded from um uh the</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.679" end="00:18:06.080" style="s2">the ecology and um that that shows up</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.280" end="00:18:06.559" style="s2">in multiple ways and then what you said</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.080" end="00:18:09.760" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.559" end="00:18:14.640" style="s2">gdp and wealth</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.760" end="00:18:17.200" style="s2">and money uh being very poor</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.640" end="00:18:18.160" style="s2">metrics for trying to understand human</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.200" end="00:18:20.400" style="s2">well-being</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.160" end="00:18:21.679" style="s2">and so the implicit assumption is that</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.400" end="00:18:25.679" style="s2">they are</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.679" end="00:18:28.480" style="s2">the metrics that constitute</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.679" end="00:18:29.120" style="s2">the algorithm of the normativity by</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.480" end="00:18:31.120" style="s2">which we</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.120" end="00:18:33.200" style="s2">judge whether or not we&#39;re doing well or</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.120" end="00:18:34.480" style="s2">not um yeah i think that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.200" end="00:18:35.840" style="s2">something that needs to be seriously</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.480" end="00:18:40.400" style="s2">brought into question</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.840" end="00:18:41.840" style="s2">so how</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.400" end="00:18:43.760" style="s2">sorry i&#39;m sorry i don&#39;t mean to back you</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.840" end="00:18:47.200" style="s2">into a corner like now layman</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.760" end="00:18:50.480" style="s2">solved the world but i mean uh so</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.200" end="00:18:51.760" style="s2">how though um yeah i think it&#39;s got a</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.480" end="00:18:53.919" style="s2">couple of different sides</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.760" end="00:18:55.360" style="s2">i think one thing is what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.919" end="00:18:56.320" style="s2">right now because the question would be</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.360" end="00:18:58.559" style="s2">this from</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.320" end="00:18:59.520" style="s2">like the religious angle that i try to</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.559" end="00:19:02.799" style="s2">bring into it</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.520" end="00:19:03.840" style="s2">is why is there why are we missing the</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.799" end="00:19:05.919" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.840" end="00:19:07.200" style="s2">that could adequately address the meta</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.919" end="00:19:10.000" style="s2">crisis</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.200" end="00:19:10.320" style="s2">at the in late modernity right all right</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.000" end="00:19:12.640" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.320" end="00:19:14.400" style="s2">so that uh a collective spirit is</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.640" end="00:19:16.320" style="s2">missing a nation spirit is missing in</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.400" end="00:19:17.840" style="s2">the nations and a more general spirit is</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.320" end="00:19:20.480" style="s2">missing more generally</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.840" end="00:19:22.080" style="s2">so how do you get that we in order to</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.480" end="00:19:23.679" style="s2">make some of these changes because that</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.080" end="00:19:26.000" style="s2">seems to have to come first</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.679" end="00:19:27.760" style="s2">right you could propose all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.000" end="00:19:30.160" style="s2">intelligent systemic upgrades</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.760" end="00:19:31.840" style="s2">well we need a new voting system right</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.160" end="00:19:34.720" style="s2">plurality voting</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.840" end="00:19:35.280" style="s2">in a non-proportional sense it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.720" end="00:19:37.200" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.280" end="00:19:38.240" style="s2">expressing the will of the people at all</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.200" end="00:19:40.160" style="s2">and you&#39;re not going to get anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.240" end="00:19:41.600" style="s2">unless you have a smarter voting system</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.160" end="00:19:43.679" style="s2">okay but how are we going to make that</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.600" end="00:19:44.640" style="s2">change we have to share a common ethos</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.679" end="00:19:47.440" style="s2">to make that change</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.640" end="00:19:48.720" style="s2">first and you get that common ethos on</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.440" end="00:19:50.640" style="s2">the one hand through a small</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.720" end="00:19:52.559" style="s2">nucleus of people who are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.640" end="00:19:55.280" style="s2">figure out for themselves</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.559" end="00:19:57.360" style="s2">through sense-making engagements what</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.280" end="00:20:00.000" style="s2">that new ethos is like</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.360" end="00:20:02.080" style="s2">the problem is those people it&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.000" end="00:20:04.240" style="s2">slow to expect that that will spread to</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.080" end="00:20:07.039" style="s2">everyone in time</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.240" end="00:20:09.520" style="s2">so those people have to at some point</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.039" end="00:20:11.360" style="s2">start to converge on a minimum set of</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.520" end="00:20:14.640" style="s2">policy demands</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.360" end="00:20:16.080" style="s2">that would raise the bottom uh the floor</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.640" end="00:20:18.880" style="s2">of the society</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.080" end="00:20:21.840" style="s2">in a way that can piggyback on</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.880" end="00:20:24.159" style="s2">spontaneous mass mobilizations of people</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.840" end="00:20:25.039" style="s2">around certain issues and themes so</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.159" end="00:20:27.360" style="s2">that&#39;s where the</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.039" end="00:20:29.200" style="s2">meta progressive argument would come in</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.360" end="00:20:31.039" style="s2">it&#39;s not that we agree with</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.200" end="00:20:32.480" style="s2">you know everything that&#39;s going on in</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.039" end="00:20:33.360" style="s2">the streets in the united states for</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.480" end="00:20:35.039" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.360" end="00:20:37.360" style="s2">but we have to be looking at what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.039" end="00:20:40.159" style="s2">going on in the mass of the people</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.360" end="00:20:40.559" style="s2">that we could link into in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.159" end="00:20:43.600" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.559" end="00:20:47.440" style="s2">better sense makers can validate</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.600" end="00:20:49.840" style="s2">as a minimum set of changes that would</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.440" end="00:20:51.120" style="s2">depressurize stabilize and enhance the</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.840" end="00:20:53.600" style="s2">overall system</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.120" end="00:20:55.440" style="s2">so that on top of that a much more</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.600" end="00:20:57.679" style="s2">sophisticated politics might be able to</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.440" end="00:21:02.320" style="s2">evolve</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.679" end="00:21:03.760" style="s2">okay so that&#39;s very interesting um</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.320" end="00:21:05.600" style="s2">maybe at some point we could talk about</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.760" end="00:21:06.080" style="s2">that in connection with uh the proposal</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.600" end="00:21:08.799" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.080" end="00:21:09.280" style="s2">have about stealing the culture uh but</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.799" end="00:21:12.240" style="s2">i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.280" end="00:21:12.240" style="s2">i&#39;m interested in</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.880" end="00:21:16.559" style="s2">perhaps if you could give a concrete</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.679" end="00:21:19.600" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.559" end="00:21:21.280" style="s2">of what um one of these minimally</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.600" end="00:21:24.159" style="s2">necessary proposals</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.280" end="00:21:24.799" style="s2">uh would look like and and sort of how</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.159" end="00:21:26.720" style="s2">does it</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.799" end="00:21:28.640" style="s2">because what i see what i see those</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.720" end="00:21:30.720" style="s2">needing to do</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.640" end="00:21:32.240" style="s2">is they they need to almost be symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.720" end="00:21:34.559" style="s2">in the sense of they need to</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.240" end="00:21:35.360" style="s2">they need to have they need to have a</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.559" end="00:21:39.039" style="s2">meaning</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.360" end="00:21:40.559" style="s2">uh for our current frame um in order for</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.039" end="00:21:43.120" style="s2">them to catch</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.559" end="00:21:45.600" style="s2">uh but they also need to have they also</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.120" end="00:21:48.799" style="s2">need to have a meaning to the emerging</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.600" end="00:21:52.080" style="s2">sense-making frame um and so</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.799" end="00:21:53.120" style="s2">do you maybe you don&#39;t no shame if you</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.080" end="00:21:55.039" style="s2">don&#39;t i&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.120" end="00:21:56.799" style="s2">but do you have a concrete example that</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.039" end="00:21:58.799" style="s2">we might discuss in detail</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.799" end="00:22:00.960" style="s2">well we could think about something like</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.799" end="00:22:03.120" style="s2">the um</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.960" end="00:22:04.000" style="s2">the the two different types of</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.120" end="00:22:05.919" style="s2">progressive</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.000" end="00:22:07.360" style="s2">economic well-being proposals that have</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.919" end="00:22:08.159" style="s2">gone on in the states and around the</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.360" end="00:22:10.159" style="s2">world so</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.159" end="00:22:11.200" style="s2">federal jobs guarantee or universal</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.159" end="00:22:13.280" style="s2">basic income</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.200" end="00:22:14.880" style="s2">right right those are a little bit in</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.280" end="00:22:16.000" style="s2">tandem some people lean one way some</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.880" end="00:22:17.360" style="s2">people in the other way</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.000" end="00:22:19.200" style="s2">a lot of people would like to see some</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.360" end="00:22:20.960" style="s2">mix of those two right</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.200" end="00:22:22.400" style="s2">the purpose of both of those things is</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.960" end="00:22:24.320" style="s2">to create</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.400" end="00:22:26.400" style="s2">more economic flow through in a</p>

<p begin="00:22:29.919" end="00:22:33.919" style="s2">extremely necessary because inevitable</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.159" end="00:22:36.480" style="s2">system shocks are coming</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.919" end="00:22:37.679" style="s2">yeah and people do have to be able to at</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.480" end="00:22:39.840" style="s2">least temporarily</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.679" end="00:22:41.200" style="s2">fall out of their profession and still</p>

<p begin="00:22:41.200" end="00:22:45.520" style="s2">in order for there to be a decrease of</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.679" end="00:22:47.520" style="s2">anxiety and tension and in order for</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.520" end="00:22:48.400" style="s2">them to still be able to spend into the</p>

<p begin="00:22:54.000" end="00:22:57.840" style="s2">so that&#39;s the general picture of you</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.760" end="00:23:00.000" style="s2">know depressurizing and stabilizing</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.840" end="00:23:02.000" style="s2">and in preparation for inevitable</p>

<p begin="00:23:02.000" end="00:23:05.039" style="s2">but then the way you would key into the</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.159" end="00:23:07.200" style="s2">meta</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.039" end="00:23:09.120" style="s2">element of it is to frame it in</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.200" end="00:23:10.080" style="s2">something like a maslow&#39;s hierarchy of</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.120" end="00:23:12.320" style="s2">needs thing</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.080" end="00:23:14.000" style="s2">right you don&#39;t need everyone to have</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.320" end="00:23:15.840" style="s2">the same amount of money</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.000" end="00:23:17.440" style="s2">in fact we know that there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.840" end="00:23:20.000" style="s2">an initial amount</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.440" end="00:23:21.200" style="s2">of financial stability that does most of</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.000" end="00:23:23.520" style="s2">the well-being work</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.200" end="00:23:24.720" style="s2">totally totally it&#39;s up for grabs right</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.520" end="00:23:25.840" style="s2">you don&#39;t need everyone to have a</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.720" end="00:23:28.880" style="s2">million dollars</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.840" end="00:23:31.120" style="s2">you need everyone in general yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.880" end="00:23:33.840" style="s2">basic stability to make them able to</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.120" end="00:23:35.440" style="s2">move to the next level of meeting making</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.840" end="00:23:37.039" style="s2">so yeah so that&#39;s what i was going to</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.440" end="00:23:39.120" style="s2">say and so what what</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.039" end="00:23:40.080" style="s2">what i see ubi and other things doing is</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.120" end="00:23:42.880" style="s2">saying</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.080" end="00:23:44.000" style="s2">look when people are in scarcity</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.880" end="00:23:45.440" style="s2">mentality</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.000" end="00:23:47.200" style="s2">their problem-solving abilities go down</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.440" end="00:23:49.760" style="s2">their cognitive flexibility goes down</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.200" end="00:23:50.880" style="s2">their ability to pursue long-term goals</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.760" end="00:23:52.400" style="s2">goes down in fact</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.880" end="00:23:54.080" style="s2">people like margaret thatcher had the</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.400" end="00:23:56.640" style="s2">causation the wrong way around</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.080" end="00:23:58.159" style="s2">they blamed the poor for you know being</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.640" end="00:24:01.200" style="s2">impulsive et cetera</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.159" end="00:24:03.600" style="s2">so no it&#39;s we have overwhelming evidence</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.200" end="00:24:05.440" style="s2">that uh scarcity mentality and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.600" end="00:24:06.159" style="s2">just financial scarcity it&#39;s scarcity of</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.440" end="00:24:08.960" style="s2">other things</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.159" end="00:24:11.840" style="s2">uh scarcity of relationship uh scarcity</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.960" end="00:24:11.840" style="s2">of social contact</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.320" end="00:24:16.840" style="s2">scarcity healthcare um etc so all kinds</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.679" end="00:24:19.760" style="s2">of scarcities</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.840" end="00:24:21.520" style="s2">uh basically put people into a very</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.760" end="00:24:24.640" style="s2">tight reciprocal narrowing</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.520" end="00:24:28.240" style="s2">which really limits uh their ability to</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.640" end="00:24:31.520" style="s2">cultivate wisdom but what</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.240" end="00:24:32.159" style="s2">so how so this is a there&#39;s a point that</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.520" end="00:24:34.559" style="s2">comes up when</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.159" end="00:24:36.159" style="s2">in discussion with zach it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.559" end="00:24:40.559" style="s2">that we need to pair</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.159" end="00:24:44.240" style="s2">uh these kinds of socioeconomic</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.559" end="00:24:46.320" style="s2">uh proposals with something like</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.240" end="00:24:48.080" style="s2">sort of pedagogical proposals of some</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.320" end="00:24:51.440" style="s2">kind</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.080" end="00:24:54.799" style="s2">because here&#39;s the concern might be that</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.440" end="00:24:56.080" style="s2">right you want to get people out of</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.799" end="00:24:58.400" style="s2">scarcity</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.080" end="00:25:00.000" style="s2">but you want you want to do so you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.400" end="00:25:02.799" style="s2">want to mandate i get that</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.000" end="00:25:03.840" style="s2">but you want to do something to afford</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.799" end="00:25:06.880" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.840" end="00:25:07.840" style="s2">then using up that liver that liberated</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.880" end="00:25:11.679" style="s2">cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.840" end="00:25:12.480" style="s2">ability um at least part of the part of</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.679" end="00:25:14.000" style="s2">it should be</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.480" end="00:25:15.600" style="s2">or exactly what we&#39;re proposing here</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.000" end="00:25:18.320" style="s2">which is the cultivation</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.600" end="00:25:19.360" style="s2">of wisdom so how do you how do you get</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.320" end="00:25:21.600" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.360" end="00:25:22.720" style="s2">it so it that strikes me where some of</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.600" end="00:25:23.600" style="s2">the stuff we&#39;ve been talking about</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.720" end="00:25:27.760" style="s2">earlier</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.600" end="00:25:29.520" style="s2">uh comes to mind which is a project</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.760" end="00:25:31.600" style="s2">that you know the religion that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.520" end="00:25:33.200" style="s2">religion the the the</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.600" end="00:25:34.960" style="s2">the version you&#39;ve talked about in</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.200" end="00:25:35.360" style="s2">previous conversations it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.960" end="00:25:37.440" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.360" end="00:25:38.880" style="s2">that that is needed to go along and then</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.440" end="00:25:43.120" style="s2">here&#39;s the concern i have</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.880" end="00:25:45.600" style="s2">it sounds to me like that project</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.120" end="00:25:46.480" style="s2">has to be also paired and minimally</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.600" end="00:25:48.720" style="s2">afforded with</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.480" end="00:25:49.760" style="s2">their socioeconomic policies but i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.720" end="00:25:53.679" style="s2">very</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.760" end="00:25:56.159" style="s2">wary of giving the state access</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.679" end="00:25:57.120" style="s2">to the emerging let&#39;s just let me use my</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.159" end="00:25:58.480" style="s2">term for now please</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.120" end="00:26:00.720" style="s2">uh the emerging religion that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.480" end="00:26:02.799" style="s2">religion so that&#39;s my concern</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.720" end="00:26:04.159" style="s2">so let me just simplify that i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.799" end="00:26:06.559" style="s2">summarize</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.159" end="00:26:07.760" style="s2">i think that the socioeconomic proposals</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.559" end="00:26:09.760" style="s2">need to be prepared</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.760" end="00:26:12.080" style="s2">need to be paired with for broadly</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.760" end="00:26:14.799" style="s2">speaking spiritual religious proposals</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.080" end="00:26:16.960" style="s2">i&#39;m okay with the state over here with</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.799" end="00:26:19.039" style="s2">the socioeconomic policy</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.960" end="00:26:21.039" style="s2">you know enforcement generation and</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.039" end="00:26:21.919" style="s2">enforcement i&#39;m not happy with the state</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.039" end="00:26:24.480" style="s2">over here</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.919" end="00:26:25.440" style="s2">uh because we&#39;ve got that&#39;s we&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.480" end="00:26:26.480" style="s2">very good history</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.440" end="00:26:28.640" style="s2">and one of the things that i thought</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.480" end="00:26:30.720" style="s2">modernity got right was no no</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.640" end="00:26:31.760" style="s2">the state and that and whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.720" end="00:26:33.919" style="s2">religion</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.760" end="00:26:35.440" style="s2">let&#39;s not get those really tightly bound</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.919" end="00:26:37.360" style="s2">together um</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.440" end="00:26:39.279" style="s2">but maybe maybe you want to criticize</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.360" end="00:26:41.120" style="s2">that notion</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.279" end="00:26:42.960" style="s2">well i think it is important to think</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.120" end="00:26:46.080" style="s2">about those as two zones</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.960" end="00:26:47.520" style="s2">of inquiry right the uh whether it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.080" end="00:26:48.799" style="s2">lower left and lower right on the</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.520" end="00:26:50.840" style="s2">integral grid or</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.799" end="00:26:52.000" style="s2">something like uh participatory and</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.840" end="00:26:54.320" style="s2">procedural</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.000" end="00:26:55.039" style="s2">approaches right because there you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.320" end="00:26:57.679" style="s2">got to build</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.039" end="00:27:00.240" style="s2">spirit for the we and you&#39;ve got to have</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.679" end="00:27:02.400" style="s2">correlated procedures to implement that</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.240" end="00:27:03.600" style="s2">and those reinforce each other rather</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.400" end="00:27:05.520" style="s2">than</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.600" end="00:27:07.840" style="s2">destructively interfere with each other</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.520" end="00:27:11.360" style="s2">yes yes uh however</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.840" end="00:27:13.200" style="s2">uh i think there&#39;s a a critique we could</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.360" end="00:27:15.200" style="s2">bring to the standard modern notion of</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.200" end="00:27:17.279" style="s2">the separation of church and state</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.200" end="00:27:19.440" style="s2">please say that what they&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.279" end="00:27:20.480" style="s2">separating the pre-modern notions of</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.440" end="00:27:21.360" style="s2">church and state</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.480" end="00:27:23.440" style="s2">right when they&#39;re doing that</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.360" end="00:27:24.880" style="s2">habermassie and separation of the value</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.440" end="00:27:27.760" style="s2">spheres</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.880" end="00:27:29.440" style="s2">actually setting up a bigger picture in</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.760" end="00:27:30.399" style="s2">which a comparable integration could</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.440" end="00:27:33.279" style="s2">take place</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.399" end="00:27:34.000" style="s2">it looks totalizing and totalitarian in</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.279" end="00:27:35.760" style="s2">the pre-modern</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.000" end="00:27:37.840" style="s2">sense but that&#39;s because that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.760" end="00:27:39.520" style="s2">smaller sense so we&#39;re going to widen</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.840" end="00:27:41.200" style="s2">out the space between those</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.520" end="00:27:42.960" style="s2">but that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean they</p>

<p begin="00:27:42.960" end="00:27:47.760" style="s2">because if we think about uh some of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.159" end="00:27:50.240" style="s2">great modern figures if you think about</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.760" end="00:27:53.520" style="s2">like a benjamin franklin who&#39;s almost a</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.240" end="00:27:54.640" style="s2">a civic saint in the sense of socrates</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.520" end="00:27:57.600" style="s2">or kierkegaard or</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.640" end="00:27:58.080" style="s2">goethe or those guys right he seems to</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.600" end="00:28:01.039" style="s2">bring</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.080" end="00:28:03.200" style="s2">a religiousness to his political affairs</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.039" end="00:28:05.919" style="s2">and to the orchestration of the saint</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.200" end="00:28:07.200" style="s2">it seems to be sort of harmonized and</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.919" end="00:28:09.919" style="s2">smoothed out</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.200" end="00:28:11.600" style="s2">in that embodiment and i think there are</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.919" end="00:28:13.919" style="s2">modern figures and there are modern</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.600" end="00:28:16.080" style="s2">moments in which that tends to occur</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.919" end="00:28:18.080" style="s2">and that&#39;s sort of the idealized version</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.080" end="00:28:20.240" style="s2">of how modernity could operate</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.080" end="00:28:21.760" style="s2">the opposite of modernity subsystems all</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.240" end="00:28:23.440" style="s2">disagreeing with each other</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.760" end="00:28:25.440" style="s2">would be modernity subsystems</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.440" end="00:28:28.240" style="s2">orchestrated together to create the kind</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.440" end="00:28:30.320" style="s2">of surplus harmony i keep talking about</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.240" end="00:28:31.679" style="s2">and that could happen with modernity</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.320" end="00:28:33.360" style="s2">we&#39;d like it to happen with a</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.679" end="00:28:35.600" style="s2">trans-modern system</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.360" end="00:28:36.880" style="s2">but that system&#39;s just in the process of</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.600" end="00:28:39.200" style="s2">booting up</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.880" end="00:28:41.200" style="s2">so i think it&#39;s not so much that the</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.200" end="00:28:42.960" style="s2">church and state gets separated</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.200" end="00:28:44.320" style="s2">it&#39;s that lower versions of church and</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.960" end="00:28:46.559" style="s2">state get separated</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.320" end="00:28:48.159" style="s2">so that something religion like can</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.559" end="00:28:49.760" style="s2">flourish at the next level</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.159" end="00:28:51.760" style="s2">but we might not call that religion you</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.760" end="00:28:53.919" style="s2">might just call it a generalized</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.760" end="00:28:56.159" style="s2">spirit of you know shared culture and</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.919" end="00:28:57.840" style="s2">coherence or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.159" end="00:28:59.279" style="s2">stephen batcher calls it a culture of</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.840" end="00:29:01.919" style="s2">awakening which i</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.279" end="00:29:02.320" style="s2">which i think is a way of putting it</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.919" end="00:29:04.000" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.320" end="00:29:05.679" style="s2">i treat the word renaissance and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.000" end="00:29:08.320" style="s2">word religionization</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.679" end="00:29:08.880" style="s2">as kind of convergent when when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.320" end="00:29:12.000" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.880" end="00:29:14.720" style="s2">correctly or healthily in my terms</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.000" end="00:29:15.360" style="s2">yeah so i mean this this means like i</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.720" end="00:29:16.960" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.360" end="00:29:18.480" style="s2">this i think points towards sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.960" end="00:29:21.440" style="s2">meta-modern understanding</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.480" end="00:29:21.760" style="s2">of what religion would be like um that</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.440" end="00:29:24.640" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.760" end="00:29:26.640" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be inherently pluralistic</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.640" end="00:29:29.919" style="s2">not relativistic but it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.640" end="00:29:31.520" style="s2">sort of inherently pluralistic</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.919" end="00:29:34.000" style="s2">at one level perhaps at the</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.520" end="00:29:36.720" style="s2">propositional level while being</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.000" end="00:29:37.679" style="s2">well also tied to more universal</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.720" end="00:29:40.320" style="s2">processes</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.679" end="00:29:41.279" style="s2">by which people access and accentuate</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.320" end="00:29:46.000" style="s2">religio</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.279" end="00:29:48.799" style="s2">um and i i sort of see that as</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.000" end="00:29:49.840" style="s2">part of what i want what i&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.799" end="00:29:51.200" style="s2">talk about when i&#39;m talking about an</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.840" end="00:29:53.039" style="s2">ecology of practice</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.200" end="00:29:54.720" style="s2">and i i keep repeating i keep reminding</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.039" end="00:29:57.679" style="s2">people even in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.720" end="00:29:59.440" style="s2">sangha that i lead but you&#39;re not the</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.679" end="00:30:00.960" style="s2">idea is not that we all do all the same</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.440" end="00:30:04.000" style="s2">practices is that we</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.960" end="00:30:05.840" style="s2">get an idea about what are areas what</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.000" end="00:30:08.720" style="s2">are types of practices</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.840" end="00:30:10.480" style="s2">right um and what are principles or how</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.720" end="00:30:11.200" style="s2">types of practices can be linked and</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.480" end="00:30:13.440" style="s2">layered</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.200" end="00:30:14.480" style="s2">and put into opponent processing</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.440" end="00:30:16.159" style="s2">complementarity</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.480" end="00:30:18.720" style="s2">and all of that and then but people</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.159" end="00:30:21.840" style="s2">would still be i mean</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.720" end="00:30:23.520" style="s2">they should be free to choose like maybe</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.840" end="00:30:24.720" style="s2">my practices are going to come primarily</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.520" end="00:30:26.640" style="s2">from christianity</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.720" end="00:30:28.000" style="s2">or perhaps they&#39;re going to come from</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.640" end="00:30:28.880" style="s2">you know aspects of christianity and</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.000" end="00:30:31.440" style="s2">buddhism or</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.880" end="00:30:33.600" style="s2">et cetera et cetera does that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.440" end="00:30:35.279" style="s2">line up with what you&#39;re proposing</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.600" end="00:30:37.120" style="s2">well absolutely i mean if you try to</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.279" end="00:30:38.159" style="s2">imagine to extrapolate what a</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.120" end="00:30:41.120" style="s2">trans-modern</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.159" end="00:30:42.960" style="s2">system looks like it&#39;s got roughly all</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.120" end="00:30:44.720" style="s2">the benefits of modernity but it&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.960" end="00:30:47.279" style="s2">more multifarious it&#39;s much more</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.720" end="00:30:49.679" style="s2">realistic it&#39;s also much more ecological</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.279" end="00:30:52.240" style="s2">so the term ecology of practices is good</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.679" end="00:30:52.720" style="s2">not just because it speaks to a shared</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.240" end="00:30:54.159" style="s2">pool</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.720" end="00:30:56.320" style="s2">from which we intentionally or</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.159" end="00:30:57.919" style="s2">instinctively draw the practices that</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.320" end="00:31:00.960" style="s2">we&#39;re using at any given time</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.919" end="00:31:03.840" style="s2">but also because i think we can guess</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.960" end="00:31:04.320" style="s2">that the ecosystem is going to be a much</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.840" end="00:31:06.799" style="s2">bigger</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.320" end="00:31:08.159" style="s2">part of that new religionization than it</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.799" end="00:31:11.519" style="s2">has been in the past</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.159" end="00:31:13.919" style="s2">at least since the uh archaic era yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.519" end="00:31:15.440" style="s2">i agree with that i agree with that so</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.919" end="00:31:18.720" style="s2">the idea would be</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.440" end="00:31:20.960" style="s2">that i mean that would bring us closer</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.720" end="00:31:22.000" style="s2">to aristotle&#39;s notion and even perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.960" end="00:31:23.279" style="s2">plato&#39;s notion</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.000" end="00:31:24.960" style="s2">i&#39;m not talking about his specific</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.279" end="00:31:25.840" style="s2">political proposals like the philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.960" end="00:31:28.080" style="s2">kings</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.840" end="00:31:29.039" style="s2">um although marcus aurelius uh does come</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.080" end="00:31:32.399" style="s2">to mind as</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.039" end="00:31:36.240" style="s2">a clear success um</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.399" end="00:31:37.760" style="s2">but the idea that um sort of analogous</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.240" end="00:31:41.120" style="s2">to how</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.760" end="00:31:44.559" style="s2">philosophia the cultivation of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.120" end="00:31:46.799" style="s2">and the and the practice of politics</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.559" end="00:31:48.480" style="s2">were supposed to be wed together</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.799" end="00:31:49.840" style="s2">you&#39;re seeing something like sort of</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.480" end="00:31:52.880" style="s2">wise uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.840" end="00:31:55.760" style="s2">religiosity not sorry right</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.880" end="00:31:56.960" style="s2">and and political practice being uh wed</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.760" end="00:32:00.080" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.960" end="00:32:03.679" style="s2">absolutely i think um you know where</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.080" end="00:32:05.440" style="s2">you&#39;ve seen really uh bold historical</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.679" end="00:32:07.919" style="s2">examples of religion</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.440" end="00:32:09.679" style="s2">whether it&#39;s islamic or tibetan buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.919" end="00:32:12.320" style="s2">or the catholic church</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.679" end="00:32:14.000" style="s2">you see that they exert a kind of supra</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.320" end="00:32:15.840" style="s2">political political influence</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.000" end="00:32:17.840" style="s2">yeah well they&#39;re civilization builders</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.840" end="00:32:19.360" style="s2">yeah well they&#39;re in their flourishing</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.840" end="00:32:19.919" style="s2">moments as opposed to their decay</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.360" end="00:32:23.360" style="s2">moments</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.919" end="00:32:23.919" style="s2">yeah yeah um they&#39;re stepping across the</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.360" end="00:32:26.080" style="s2">normal</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.919" end="00:32:27.679" style="s2">genres of business and politics and</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.080" end="00:32:29.840" style="s2">orchestrating together</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.679" end="00:32:30.880" style="s2">people in a shared symbol language a</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.840" end="00:32:32.640" style="s2">shared spirit</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.880" end="00:32:35.120" style="s2">a shared sense of a transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.640" end="00:32:37.360" style="s2">something on behalf of which</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.120" end="00:32:39.039" style="s2">they could be mobilized to make changes</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.360" end="00:32:41.200" style="s2">that meet their current moments</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.039" end="00:32:43.120" style="s2">because one of the things we face now is</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.200" end="00:32:44.480" style="s2">everyone agrees there&#39;s a crisis</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.120" end="00:32:46.559" style="s2">there&#39;s actually a lot of agreement on</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.480" end="00:32:48.320" style="s2">what the solutions might look like</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.559" end="00:32:50.480" style="s2">but mobilizing individuals and</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.320" end="00:32:50.960" style="s2">mobilizing systems to do anything about</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.480" end="00:32:54.080" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.960" end="00:32:56.480" style="s2">seems to be a real problem we lack the</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.080" end="00:32:58.159" style="s2">sense of energy and clarity and</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.480" end="00:32:59.919" style="s2">coherence and that we could actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.159" end="00:33:02.080" style="s2">accomplish something that part</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.919" end="00:33:03.600" style="s2">in a way the religious part the spirit</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.080" end="00:33:06.080" style="s2">is missing</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.600" end="00:33:07.840" style="s2">i agree with you on that um so here</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.080" end="00:33:09.600" style="s2">here&#39;s a uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.840" end="00:33:11.120" style="s2">some distance between you and i though</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.600" end="00:33:13.679" style="s2">um and</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.120" end="00:33:15.600" style="s2">maybe i&#39;m pretty sure we&#39;ll be able to</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.679" end="00:33:17.840" style="s2">close the distance</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.600" end="00:33:19.279" style="s2">i i tend to be more pessimistic and uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.840" end="00:33:21.519" style="s2">and therefore more radical</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.279" end="00:33:22.799" style="s2">and that&#39;s why i have the proposal of</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.519" end="00:33:23.919" style="s2">steal the culture and i</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.799" end="00:33:25.440" style="s2">often say i don&#39;t want the french</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.919" end="00:33:26.320" style="s2">revolution i want something like the axo</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.440" end="00:33:28.720" style="s2">revolution</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.320" end="00:33:29.919" style="s2">i want what christianity did right it</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.720" end="00:33:32.799" style="s2">basically</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.919" end="00:33:33.120" style="s2">underneath and even under oppression uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.799" end="00:33:35.679" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.120" end="00:33:36.320" style="s2">like it built a a new culture a new way</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.679" end="00:33:39.200" style="s2">of being</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.320" end="00:33:39.600" style="s2">that then permeated up and then uh took</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.200" end="00:33:42.399" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.600" end="00:33:42.799" style="s2">stole the stole the roman empire from</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.399" end="00:33:45.440" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.799" end="00:33:45.919" style="s2">existing power structures and basically</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.440" end="00:33:49.120" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.919" end="00:33:51.120" style="s2">built the grammar for um</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.120" end="00:33:52.480" style="s2">the new civilization the medieval world</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.120" end="00:33:54.080" style="s2">and that&#39;s what i mean by stealing the</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.480" end="00:33:57.120" style="s2">culture that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.080" end="00:33:58.480" style="s2">because i was just at the movement</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.120" end="00:34:00.880" style="s2">summit</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.480" end="00:34:02.960" style="s2">uh a week ago yesterday and just the</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.880" end="00:34:04.799" style="s2">number of communities of practice</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.960" end="00:34:06.000" style="s2">in which people are not just talking</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.799" end="00:34:06.640" style="s2">they&#39;re doing all these transformative</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.000" end="00:34:09.200" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.640" end="00:34:10.720" style="s2">movement practices mindfulness practices</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.200" end="00:34:12.560" style="s2">discourse practices and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.720" end="00:34:14.079" style="s2">integrating these ecologies and it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.560" end="00:34:15.679" style="s2">happening and they&#39;re all getting</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.079" end="00:34:18.240" style="s2">starting to get together and network and</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.679" end="00:34:19.359" style="s2">talk and so i want to facilitate that as</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.240" end="00:34:20.720" style="s2">much as possible</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.359" end="00:34:22.960" style="s2">and where i think i might be more</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.720" end="00:34:23.760" style="s2">pessimistic to you but i i respect you</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.960" end="00:34:27.040" style="s2">so i want to hear</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.760" end="00:34:29.119" style="s2">i&#39;m open to being persuaded by you um i</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.040" end="00:34:31.760" style="s2">i mean i come from sort of a chomsky in</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.119" end="00:34:34.399" style="s2">view that the game is so badly rigged</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.760" end="00:34:36.159" style="s2">now the game is so badly rated you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.399" end="00:34:37.280" style="s2">and jordan hall has had an influence on</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.159" end="00:34:40.399" style="s2">me on this too</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.280" end="00:34:44.000" style="s2">the game is so badly rigged um</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.399" end="00:34:48.720" style="s2">and even the social media like</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.000" end="00:34:50.320" style="s2">it&#39;s so badly rigged in to perpetuate</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.720" end="00:34:53.119" style="s2">and you alluded to this earlier</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.320" end="00:34:54.079" style="s2">to perpetuate a very decadent uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.119" end="00:34:57.440" style="s2">modernity</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.079" end="00:34:59.440" style="s2">meaning crisis oppositional um</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.440" end="00:35:02.000" style="s2">vicious in the sense of vice and also</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.440" end="00:35:04.640" style="s2">cruel form of capitalism um</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.000" end="00:35:05.680" style="s2">that i&#39;m i i don&#39;t know if we can work</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.640" end="00:35:09.119" style="s2">within the game</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.680" end="00:35:11.359" style="s2">enough uh to bring about the changes</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.119" end="00:35:12.960" style="s2">well i think that that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.359" end="00:35:14.400" style="s2">areas where we have to work</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.960" end="00:35:17.119" style="s2">right then we need to think of an</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.400" end="00:35:19.839" style="s2">ongoing struggle that never has an end</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.119" end="00:35:20.640" style="s2">and is constantly applied in multiple</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.839" end="00:35:22.640" style="s2">silos</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.640" end="00:35:23.760" style="s2">let&#39;s say right right right that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.640" end="00:35:25.440" style="s2">you&#39;ve all got to work</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.760" end="00:35:27.599" style="s2">within the system you&#39;ve always got to</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.440" end="00:35:28.560" style="s2">be building counter institutions to the</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.599" end="00:35:30.240" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.560" end="00:35:31.839" style="s2">uh you&#39;ve always got to be building up</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.240" end="00:35:33.119" style="s2">the spirit of the base</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.839" end="00:35:34.720" style="s2">you&#39;ve always got to be looking for</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.119" end="00:35:37.040" style="s2">top-down leverage points that will</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.720" end="00:35:39.839" style="s2">facilitate all of those things</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.040" end="00:35:40.560" style="s2">so it&#39;s a multi-front battle so to speak</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.839" end="00:35:41.839" style="s2">if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.560" end="00:35:44.560" style="s2">you know can tolerate the battle</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.839" end="00:35:47.760" style="s2">metaphor uh and there are</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.560" end="00:35:48.800" style="s2">i mean it is very uh exciting to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.760" end="00:35:51.599" style="s2">among people</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.800" end="00:35:54.560" style="s2">and see the flourishing of new</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.599" end="00:35:56.640" style="s2">communities of practice and inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.560" end="00:35:59.280" style="s2">there are some limitations on that one</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.640" end="00:35:59.599" style="s2">is can that spread fast enough to meet</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.280" end="00:36:02.640" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.599" end="00:36:03.520" style="s2">impending crises another one is does</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.640" end="00:36:06.079" style="s2">that spirit</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.520" end="00:36:07.440" style="s2">translate into protocols that are as or</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.079" end="00:36:09.440" style="s2">more effective than the current</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.440" end="00:36:12.800" style="s2">protocols and can out compete them</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.440" end="00:36:13.359" style="s2">yes and then the third one is what if</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.800" end="00:36:16.560" style="s2">you got</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.359" end="00:36:18.960" style="s2">95 of people in the new category and the</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.560" end="00:36:21.040" style="s2">remaining five percent was a tiny little</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.960" end="00:36:23.280" style="s2">self-sustaining loop that still exerted</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.040" end="00:36:24.640" style="s2">all the military and technological and</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.280" end="00:36:26.640" style="s2">media control</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.640" end="00:36:27.920" style="s2">right right so that you&#39;ve got to get in</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.640" end="00:36:30.000" style="s2">there and we know from</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.920" end="00:36:32.000" style="s2">for example the covet thing the</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.000" end="00:36:32.960" style="s2">different response patterns of different</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.000" end="00:36:35.200" style="s2">countries</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.960" end="00:36:36.560" style="s2">at the state level have made a huge</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.200" end="00:36:38.720" style="s2">difference in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.560" end="00:36:41.119" style="s2">well-being state so you&#39;ve got to get</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.720" end="00:36:43.440" style="s2">into that top-down structure</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.119" end="00:36:45.200" style="s2">as well as build alternative</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.440" end="00:36:46.800" style="s2">institutions as well as</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.200" end="00:36:48.800" style="s2">steal the culture and grassroots</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.800" end="00:36:52.079" style="s2">uprising</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.800" end="00:36:55.200" style="s2">well that that was well said and i</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.079" end="00:36:56.720" style="s2">i think that i i i intend honestly to</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.200" end="00:37:00.160" style="s2">take it very seriously</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.720" end="00:37:03.040" style="s2">um like i guess it comes to a question</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.160" end="00:37:03.040" style="s2">about um</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.119" end="00:37:08.160" style="s2">i mean the urgency of this we both share</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.359" end="00:37:10.400" style="s2">a sense</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.160" end="00:37:11.440" style="s2">of the urgency of the situation in fact</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.400" end="00:37:13.839" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.440" end="00:37:15.200" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re taking that as a as</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.839" end="00:37:16.960" style="s2">a given premise</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.200" end="00:37:19.839" style="s2">upon which you&#39;re making many of your</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.960" end="00:37:24.079" style="s2">arguments um</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.839" end="00:37:25.760" style="s2">and and i think the the urgency and this</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.079" end="00:37:27.680" style="s2">is an idea i get from jordan right</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.760" end="00:37:29.040" style="s2">the urgency is even more urgent than we</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.680" end="00:37:32.079" style="s2">realized because</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.040" end="00:37:35.599" style="s2">uh the rate of change is itself changing</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.079" end="00:37:38.880" style="s2">right things are getting complex</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.599" end="00:37:39.680" style="s2">even faster right so um it&#39;s going up in</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.880" end="00:37:42.880" style="s2">a non-linear</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.680" end="00:37:46.560" style="s2">uh progression</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.880" end="00:37:48.000" style="s2">and so i have serious questions about</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.560" end="00:37:50.000" style="s2">let me give you a concrete example of</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.000" end="00:37:51.680" style="s2">what i mean yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.000" end="00:37:53.200" style="s2">madison and the other founding fathers</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.680" end="00:37:54.400" style="s2">of the united states depended on the</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.200" end="00:37:57.119" style="s2">fact that the country was</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.400" end="00:37:57.680" style="s2">physically large that was that was they</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.119" end="00:38:00.320" style="s2">they were</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.680" end="00:38:01.440" style="s2">relying on that as a background</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.320" end="00:38:04.560" style="s2">constraint</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.440" end="00:38:06.880" style="s2">to prevent kind of mass hysteria</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.560" end="00:38:07.839" style="s2">and mob politics because they were very</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.880" end="00:38:09.440" style="s2">worried they knew enough from the</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.839" end="00:38:11.839" style="s2">ancient world athens etc</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.440" end="00:38:12.800" style="s2">that democracy can degenerate very fast</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.839" end="00:38:14.400" style="s2">into something like that</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.800" end="00:38:16.480" style="s2">so they were very dependent on that and</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.400" end="00:38:17.280" style="s2">then they framed the institutions around</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.480" end="00:38:20.880" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.280" end="00:38:24.720" style="s2">right uh and the checks and balances</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.880" end="00:38:26.960" style="s2">the problem is that that is now from</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.720" end="00:38:27.839" style="s2">it has gone from being a governing</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.960" end="00:38:30.160" style="s2">variable</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.839" end="00:38:32.400" style="s2">to being completely irrelevant because</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.160" end="00:38:34.800" style="s2">of social media largely irrelevant</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.400" end="00:38:37.040" style="s2">and then the checks and balances that</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.800" end="00:38:39.520" style="s2">were supposed to work within a certain</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.040" end="00:38:41.760" style="s2">timing of events that was constrained by</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.520" end="00:38:43.920" style="s2">the physical space of the country</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.760" end="00:38:45.760" style="s2">no longer work and then you get gridlock</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.920" end="00:38:49.520" style="s2">and you get adversarial processing</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.760" end="00:38:52.560" style="s2">so i don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.520" end="00:38:55.119" style="s2">the machinery is set up</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.560" end="00:38:57.359" style="s2">to the kind of environment that we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.119" end="00:38:59.280" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.359" end="00:39:01.200" style="s2">i think there&#39;s a lot of truth to that</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.280" end="00:39:03.680" style="s2">and i think the</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.200" end="00:39:05.200" style="s2">the solutions to that are to try to</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.680" end="00:39:08.160" style="s2">create alternative machinery</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.200" end="00:39:10.560" style="s2">but also to look for any openings to</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.160" end="00:39:12.720" style="s2">hack the system in the right direction</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.560" end="00:39:14.720" style="s2">right and also there&#39;s the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.720" end="00:39:15.680" style="s2">human existential position the whole</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.720" end="00:39:17.119" style="s2">time which is</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.680" end="00:39:20.160" style="s2">you don&#39;t know if it&#39;s going to work out</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.119" end="00:39:21.760" style="s2">or not i got to live right in the moment</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.160" end="00:39:23.359" style="s2">and think that that creates change</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.760" end="00:39:25.599" style="s2">because you honestly don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.359" end="00:39:27.119" style="s2">at a certain level what creates change</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.599" end="00:39:28.880" style="s2">how you got to where you are</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.119" end="00:39:31.119" style="s2">how any of the systems got to where they</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.880" end="00:39:33.359" style="s2">are so that you have to work on</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.119" end="00:39:34.480" style="s2">being present with your being more</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.359" end="00:39:36.160" style="s2">intensely</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.480" end="00:39:38.560" style="s2">and hope that that contributes to the</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.160" end="00:39:41.200" style="s2">future that&#39;s the very basic level</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.560" end="00:39:42.480" style="s2">but at the same time we are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.200" end="00:39:44.880" style="s2">involved socially</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.480" end="00:39:45.680" style="s2">all the time as social beings yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.880" end="00:39:48.560" style="s2">means</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.680" end="00:39:49.359" style="s2">setting up new practices setting up new</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.560" end="00:39:51.599" style="s2">spirit</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.359" end="00:39:53.440" style="s2">but also trying to intervene wherever we</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.599" end="00:39:55.680" style="s2">see intervention possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.440" end="00:39:58.160" style="s2">within the existing structure given that</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.680" end="00:40:00.000" style="s2">it absolutely is built to prevent change</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.160" end="00:40:01.520" style="s2">from happening</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.000" end="00:40:03.680" style="s2">nonetheless that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.520" end="00:40:05.599" style="s2">hackable right when donald trump ran for</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.680" end="00:40:07.359" style="s2">president in 2016</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.599" end="00:40:09.680" style="s2">he did this amazing thing which is he</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.359" end="00:40:12.640" style="s2">hacked the media incentive structure</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.680" end="00:40:15.040" style="s2">yeah they are in general opposed to him</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.640" end="00:40:17.680" style="s2">most of the mainstream media people</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.040" end="00:40:19.760" style="s2">but they couldn&#39;t resist showing a a</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.680" end="00:40:21.200" style="s2">train wreck on the television every time</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.760" end="00:40:23.119" style="s2">he said something right</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.200" end="00:40:26.000" style="s2">and that ended up with billions of</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.119" end="00:40:28.079" style="s2">dollars of free political propaganda</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.000" end="00:40:29.920" style="s2">that he didn&#39;t have to cover or pay for</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.079" end="00:40:32.560" style="s2">at all right he almost became</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.920" end="00:40:34.560" style="s2">anti-fragile against the media system</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.560" end="00:40:36.480" style="s2">by causing one of its incentives to</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.560" end="00:40:38.800" style="s2">fight the other incentive</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.480" end="00:40:40.560" style="s2">so there may be all kinds of ways to do</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.800" end="00:40:42.000" style="s2">that that people just haven&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.560" end="00:40:43.680" style="s2">found yet because they haven&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.000" end="00:40:45.920" style="s2">looking it for them</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.680" end="00:40:47.280" style="s2">well i mean yeah and and i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.920" end="00:40:50.079" style="s2">right and i mean</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.280" end="00:40:52.240" style="s2">to buttress your argument um when a</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.079" end="00:40:56.000" style="s2">system is very destabilized</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.240" end="00:40:57.520" style="s2">then you get you get an emergence of</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.000" end="00:41:00.480" style="s2">the increased power of sensitive</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.520" end="00:41:02.640" style="s2">dependence on initial conditions</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.480" end="00:41:04.319" style="s2">small perturbations that otherwise would</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.640" end="00:41:05.119" style="s2">be dampened down by the inertia of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.319" end="00:41:08.000" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.119" end="00:41:10.880" style="s2">now actually have a viable chance of</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.000" end="00:41:13.680" style="s2">having a larger causal impact</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.880" end="00:41:14.960" style="s2">we&#39;re at 99 degrees doesn&#39;t take much to</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.680" end="00:41:17.680" style="s2">bump it to boil or</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.960" end="00:41:19.440" style="s2">or be fluid right exactly exactly</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.680" end="00:41:22.640" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.440" end="00:41:24.880" style="s2">so i i get that but then</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.640" end="00:41:27.119" style="s2">so sorry this is not meant to be sort of</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.880" end="00:41:29.280" style="s2">a machiavellian argument</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.119" end="00:41:31.200" style="s2">the point is i sort of have this</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.280" end="00:41:33.200" style="s2">argument that goes something like this</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.200" end="00:41:34.800" style="s2">if we&#39;re at a place where the individual</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.200" end="00:41:36.240" style="s2">actions might make a difference</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.800" end="00:41:38.240" style="s2">that is where the system is very</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.240" end="00:41:41.119" style="s2">significantly destabilized</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.240" end="00:41:42.319" style="s2">and then a real possibility of that is</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.119" end="00:41:44.800" style="s2">that the system is</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.319" end="00:41:47.280" style="s2">actually going to it&#39;s actually going to</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.800" end="00:41:47.280" style="s2">collapse</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.680" end="00:41:49.839" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.640" end="00:41:57.200" style="s2">how can we tell i mean i get your point</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.240" end="00:41:59.200" style="s2">your point is you know all the</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.200" end="00:42:00.560" style="s2">historical analogies are sort of off</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.200" end="00:42:02.240" style="s2">because we&#39;re actually ignorant because</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.560" end="00:42:04.079" style="s2">of the situation we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.240" end="00:42:05.760" style="s2">but how do we know we&#39;re not sort of at</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.079" end="00:42:09.040" style="s2">the equivalent of rome</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.760" end="00:42:10.640" style="s2">uh you know 376 where you know or even</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.040" end="00:42:14.000" style="s2">at the time of dictation</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.640" end="00:42:17.119" style="s2">right he he does he does these huge</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.000" end="00:42:20.400" style="s2">you know attempts to reform the empire</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.119" end="00:42:21.920" style="s2">and all they do is uh uh after he dies</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.400" end="00:42:23.200" style="s2">they just generate civil war</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.920" end="00:42:24.720" style="s2">that further weakens the empire and</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.200" end="00:42:25.440" style="s2">basically the western empire is just</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.720" end="00:42:28.720" style="s2">then doomed</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.440" end="00:42:28.720" style="s2">right um so</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.960" end="00:42:32.319" style="s2">well i i think in a lot of ways it</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.440" end="00:42:35.440" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.319" end="00:42:37.200" style="s2">right because you don&#39;t know the</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.440" end="00:42:38.800" style="s2">struggle to make things better is an</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.200" end="00:42:40.079" style="s2">endless struggle and it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.800" end="00:42:41.920" style="s2">what moment you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.079" end="00:42:44.240" style="s2">there&#39;s always possibilities until</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.920" end="00:42:46.800" style="s2">there&#39;s no possibilities right</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.240" end="00:42:48.560" style="s2">we can&#39;t go well we i guess we shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.800" end="00:42:49.280" style="s2">really try because we might be in a</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.560" end="00:42:52.160" style="s2">moment where</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.280" end="00:42:54.319" style="s2">it won&#39;t work yeah so that&#39;s a morally</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.160" end="00:42:55.280" style="s2">self-sabotaging argument so what we need</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.319" end="00:42:56.960" style="s2">is the moral</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.280" end="00:42:58.640" style="s2">character as the great moral leaders</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.960" end="00:43:01.359" style="s2">have had throat history</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.640" end="00:43:02.480" style="s2">to go forward with the fight regardless</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.359" end="00:43:04.160" style="s2">of the analysis</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.480" end="00:43:06.720" style="s2">of the moment to some degree and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.160" end="00:43:07.440" style="s2">always i think leverage points right the</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.720" end="00:43:09.280" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.440" end="00:43:12.400" style="s2">the time of the so-called five good</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.280" end="00:43:14.400" style="s2">emperors right rome was on decline</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.400" end="00:43:16.240" style="s2">until one of the guys didn&#39;t have kids</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.400" end="00:43:17.839" style="s2">and decided the new process would be i</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.240" end="00:43:20.000" style="s2">hire and train an apprentice</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.839" end="00:43:21.200" style="s2">yeah exactly the fortunes of the empire</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.000" end="00:43:22.960" style="s2">started going up again because you</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.200" end="00:43:24.960" style="s2">weren&#39;t just handing it off to your kid</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.960" end="00:43:27.200" style="s2">and assuming he&#39;d be a good emperor and</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.960" end="00:43:28.000" style="s2">that was just a that was one procedural</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.200" end="00:43:29.920" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.000" end="00:43:31.839" style="s2">but it it turned what could have been</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.920" end="00:43:32.720" style="s2">the empire&#39;s collapse into the empire&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.839" end="00:43:34.319" style="s2">resurgence</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.720" end="00:43:36.400" style="s2">yeah and it culminates in marcus</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.319" end="00:43:39.040" style="s2">aurelius who unfortunately was straight</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.400" end="00:43:40.880" style="s2">and that had commodus um you know i</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.040" end="00:43:43.760" style="s2">agree with you i mean</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.880" end="00:43:45.760" style="s2">i have come to the same conclusion uh i</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.760" end="00:43:46.720" style="s2">i am very unsure about the causal</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.760" end="00:43:50.079" style="s2">efficacy</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.720" end="00:43:52.640" style="s2">of what i&#39;m trying to do uh but and so</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.079" end="00:43:54.800" style="s2">and then i and then i i have the same</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.640" end="00:43:56.800" style="s2">sort of moral argument that you do well</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.800" end="00:43:58.160" style="s2">there is no alternative we have to try</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.800" end="00:44:01.520" style="s2">we have to try our best</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.160" end="00:44:03.760" style="s2">um but i also i also say that</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.520" end="00:44:05.119" style="s2">even if there&#39;s a way in which those two</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.760" end="00:44:08.960" style="s2">arguments can come together</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.119" end="00:44:10.400" style="s2">even if i fail causally</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.960" end="00:44:11.760" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.400" end="00:44:13.359" style="s2">complete failure and that&#39;s what i think</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.760" end="00:44:16.079" style="s2">of people like</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.359" end="00:44:18.319" style="s2">augustine and others that they right</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.079" end="00:44:20.560" style="s2">they they gather enough</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.319" end="00:44:21.520" style="s2">of the candles of culture and</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.560" end="00:44:23.359" style="s2">civilization</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.520" end="00:44:25.280" style="s2">and a new way of being in a new religion</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.359" end="00:44:28.079" style="s2">together uh so that</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.280" end="00:44:28.800" style="s2">something survives uh throughout the</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.079" end="00:44:30.800" style="s2">collapse</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.800" end="00:44:32.720" style="s2">and it actually affords a new</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.800" end="00:44:37.040" style="s2">civilization being born</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.720" end="00:44:39.599" style="s2">so i i i think</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.040" end="00:44:40.079" style="s2">we the reason why i want a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.599" end="00:44:42.400" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.079" end="00:44:43.599" style="s2">than just the moral argument is i i</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.400" end="00:44:45.839" style="s2">personally found that</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.599" end="00:44:47.599" style="s2">um and i consider myself somebody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.839" end="00:44:49.200" style="s2">often very strongly motivated by moral</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.599" end="00:44:51.280" style="s2">arguments</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.200" end="00:44:52.480" style="s2">i found that that has often not</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.280" end="00:44:55.680" style="s2">affectively</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.480" end="00:44:58.319" style="s2">been sufficient for me uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.680" end="00:44:58.319" style="s2">because it had</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.960" end="00:45:04.560" style="s2">it is the right thing to do but</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.000" end="00:45:05.200" style="s2">the sense that even if we don&#39;t stave</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.560" end="00:45:06.880" style="s2">off</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.200" end="00:45:08.319" style="s2">some kind and and i don&#39;t want it</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.880" end="00:45:09.280" style="s2">because you know it means millions of</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.319" end="00:45:11.280" style="s2">people die</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.280" end="00:45:12.720" style="s2">that that&#39;s that and that&#39;s horrible but</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.280" end="00:45:15.520" style="s2">even if we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.720" end="00:45:17.040" style="s2">forestall that possibility perhaps then</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.520" end="00:45:18.000" style="s2">at least we can lay the seeds of</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.040" end="00:45:21.440" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.000" end="00:45:25.200" style="s2">that will be grown out of it and</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.440" end="00:45:27.119" style="s2">so that also keeps me going personally</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.200" end="00:45:28.800" style="s2">yeah i mean i like i was saying it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.119" end="00:45:31.839" style="s2">multi-front battle so to speak</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.800" end="00:45:32.400" style="s2">right individually we&#39;re at different</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.839" end="00:45:34.640" style="s2">places</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.400" end="00:45:36.560" style="s2">right one place is we don&#39;t know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.640" end="00:45:38.480" style="s2">it will fail but maybe we can</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.560" end="00:45:40.960" style="s2">lay the seeds for ourselves or for</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.480" end="00:45:43.359" style="s2">something else in the future</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.960" end="00:45:45.440" style="s2">do that deep spiritual work that is</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.359" end="00:45:47.680" style="s2">independent of the historical moment</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.440" end="00:45:49.680" style="s2">and hope that that contributes to the</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.680" end="00:45:52.240" style="s2">betterment of the future</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.680" end="00:45:53.920" style="s2">uh at the same time we can you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.240" end="00:45:55.760" style="s2">engage in all kinds of social</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.920" end="00:45:57.359" style="s2">experiments and practices not knowing if</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.760" end="00:45:58.319" style="s2">they will succeed but having a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.359" end="00:46:00.720" style="s2">good idea</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.319" end="00:46:02.079" style="s2">of which ones will work better and that</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.720" end="00:46:03.359" style="s2">we&#39;re not in a situation</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.079" end="00:46:05.040" style="s2">here&#39;s where i think we often make a</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.359" end="00:46:06.240" style="s2">mistake is we think we&#39;re in a single</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.040" end="00:46:07.520" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.240" end="00:46:09.599" style="s2">and that system&#39;s either going to</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.520" end="00:46:11.920" style="s2">improve or fail right</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.599" end="00:46:13.599" style="s2">but really we&#39;re in multiple interactive</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.920" end="00:46:15.520" style="s2">systems yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.599" end="00:46:17.680" style="s2">modern sense right there&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.520" end="00:46:18.400" style="s2">primitive operating systems at work in</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.680" end="00:46:20.000" style="s2">society</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.400" end="00:46:22.640" style="s2">and there&#39;s more advanced operating</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.000" end="00:46:25.200" style="s2">systems at work they&#39;re interpenetrating</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.640" end="00:46:26.000" style="s2">and any one of them could gain the upper</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.200" end="00:46:28.319" style="s2">hand or</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.000" end="00:46:29.920" style="s2">you know get a 10 boost under any given</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.319" end="00:46:32.800" style="s2">conditions</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.920" end="00:46:34.319" style="s2">those conditions involve doing practices</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.800" end="00:46:36.800" style="s2">and gaining clarity</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.319" end="00:46:37.680" style="s2">personally and interpersonally about</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.800" end="00:46:40.880" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.680" end="00:46:42.079" style="s2">um specific clear things might make a</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.880" end="00:46:45.200" style="s2">huge improvement</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.079" end="00:46:46.560" style="s2">yeah and also having the classic sangha</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.200" end="00:46:49.200" style="s2">relationship of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.560" end="00:46:51.280" style="s2">the inter-subjective community of people</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.200" end="00:46:53.200" style="s2">who are working on their being</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.280" end="00:46:54.640" style="s2">i think that&#39;s very well said so i like</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.200" end="00:46:58.160" style="s2">the way this goes</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.640" end="00:47:00.319" style="s2">what i was proposing to you is i i guess</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.160" end="00:47:03.839" style="s2">to bring it back to the practicalities</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.319" end="00:47:07.920" style="s2">that it might i i like the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.839" end="00:47:10.480" style="s2">you know we we choose specific policies</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.920" end="00:47:12.079" style="s2">that are basically wisdom affording both</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.480" end="00:47:14.960" style="s2">individually and</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.079" end="00:47:15.520" style="s2">and collectively and some of those might</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.960" end="00:47:18.560" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.520" end="00:47:21.599" style="s2">socioeconomic like um ubi</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.560" end="00:47:23.119" style="s2">uh some of them i i would be</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.599" end="00:47:24.720" style="s2">a little bit different like trying to</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.119" end="00:47:26.640" style="s2">get people to recommit</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.720" end="00:47:27.839" style="s2">uh to an opponent processing model of</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.640" end="00:47:29.599" style="s2">distributed cognition</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.839" end="00:47:31.359" style="s2">rather than an adversarial one and you</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.599" end="00:47:33.599" style="s2">might need those two together</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.359" end="00:47:35.680" style="s2">and i think all of that is good but i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.599" end="00:47:38.720" style="s2">also wondering if</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.680" end="00:47:40.319" style="s2">we need to also decide like we need to</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.720" end="00:47:44.160" style="s2">have a repertoire of politic</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.319" end="00:47:46.640" style="s2">policy choices between ones that</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.160" end="00:47:47.599" style="s2">and i&#39;m proposing a mixture of them ones</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.640" end="00:47:50.480" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.599" end="00:47:52.079" style="s2">might bring about the change now and</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.480" end="00:47:54.160" style="s2">also ones that were</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.079" end="00:47:56.160" style="s2">have a kind of longevity to them that</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.160" end="00:47:59.200" style="s2">would see the future</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.160" end="00:48:00.160" style="s2">if things ultimately don&#39;t succeed yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.200" end="00:48:01.839" style="s2">i think we need to</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.160" end="00:48:03.760" style="s2">think in the meta sense we need to think</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.839" end="00:48:05.359" style="s2">about multiple time scales</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.760" end="00:48:08.000" style="s2">yeah but also about these layered</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.359" end="00:48:10.400" style="s2">multiple epistemic approaches</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.000" end="00:48:12.160" style="s2">and get really clear about what are the</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.400" end="00:48:13.920" style="s2">principles that operate at the different</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.160" end="00:48:14.880" style="s2">time scales and at the different social</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.920" end="00:48:16.880" style="s2">operating systems</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.880" end="00:48:18.880" style="s2">yes yes from my point of view one of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.880" end="00:48:20.319" style="s2">biggest difficulties in meta modern and</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.880" end="00:48:22.720" style="s2">integral thinking</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.319" end="00:48:24.480" style="s2">is we over identify the epistemic</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.720" end="00:48:26.720" style="s2">cultural operating systems with the</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.480" end="00:48:28.000" style="s2">stated values of the people who identify</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.720" end="00:48:30.240" style="s2">with those systems</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.000" end="00:48:31.200" style="s2">and not the deeper analysis of how those</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.240" end="00:48:33.839" style="s2">systems actually</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.200" end="00:48:35.359" style="s2">behave right that&#39;s very well said like</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.839" end="00:48:36.960" style="s2">that comes back to what i was saying</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.359" end="00:48:38.880" style="s2">how do you figure out the optimal grip</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.960" end="00:48:39.920" style="s2">are we using the right categories of</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.880" end="00:48:41.520" style="s2">analysis</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.920" end="00:48:43.280" style="s2">to understand what the political</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.520" end="00:48:46.319" style="s2">situation is</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.280" end="00:48:48.960" style="s2">right so this would cash out then for</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.319" end="00:48:49.359" style="s2">it sounds to me like this would cash out</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.960" end="00:48:51.839" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.359" end="00:48:53.839" style="s2">to people having kind of a fluid</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.839" end="00:48:55.119" style="s2">political in the narrower sense that we</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.839" end="00:48:56.160" style="s2">excluded at the beginning of our</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.119" end="00:48:59.440" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.160" end="00:49:01.280" style="s2">uh having a very sort of having a</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.440" end="00:49:02.720" style="s2">a very fluid political allegiance</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.280" end="00:49:05.680" style="s2">because it sounds to me</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.720" end="00:49:06.240" style="s2">like people would be voting much more in</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.680" end="00:49:09.200" style="s2">terms</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.240" end="00:49:11.040" style="s2">of policies than they necessarily would</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.200" end="00:49:13.760" style="s2">in terms of a particular party</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.040" end="00:49:15.359" style="s2">or a particular personality well we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.760" end="00:49:18.160" style="s2">definitely got to get off the</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.359" end="00:49:19.920" style="s2">celebrity and team sports models yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.160" end="00:49:22.319" style="s2">that that&#39;s so ancient in us</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.920" end="00:49:24.400" style="s2">it&#39;ll always be there to some degree yes</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.319" end="00:49:26.160" style="s2">but we do have to develop a critique of</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.400" end="00:49:27.839" style="s2">that that&#39;s strong enough to emotionally</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.160" end="00:49:29.359" style="s2">free us to think differently about our</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.839" end="00:49:30.400" style="s2">political allegiances and</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.359" end="00:49:31.920" style="s2">i think you&#39;re right they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.400" end="00:49:33.359" style="s2">have to be more nuanced and more</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.920" end="00:49:34.720" style="s2">flexible going forward</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.359" end="00:49:36.960" style="s2">and the more clear you are on the</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.720" end="00:49:38.559" style="s2">underlying principles the more leeway</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.960" end="00:49:39.280" style="s2">you have to look for where those are</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.559" end="00:49:42.000" style="s2">showing up</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.280" end="00:49:42.960" style="s2">at the moment that&#39;s very good i like</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.000" end="00:49:45.200" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.960" end="00:49:46.880" style="s2">i like that that&#39;s very good</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.200" end="00:49:48.160" style="s2">unfortunately we have a shorter time</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.880" end="00:49:51.760" style="s2">today and uh but</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.160" end="00:49:54.240" style="s2">that&#39;s it let&#39;s let&#39;s continue</p>
