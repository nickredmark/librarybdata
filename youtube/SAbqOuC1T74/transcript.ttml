<p begin="00:02:06.740" end="00:02:11.239" style="s2">turned that into a benefit now I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.170" end="00:02:13.190" style="s2">going to use Marxist dialectic in every</p>

<p begin="00:02:14.989" end="00:02:19.069" style="s2">much I&#39;m going to throw multiple</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.879" end="00:02:21.830" style="s2">critical theories at it so this one is</p>

<p begin="00:02:21.830" end="00:02:27.610" style="s2">is going to be the inverse of logic and</p>

<p begin="00:02:48.190" end="00:02:52.960" style="s2">to invert them this one were going to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.230" end="00:02:55.360" style="s2">focusing on the types of logic that the</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.960" end="00:02:57.340" style="s2">blue church tends to promote and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.360" end="00:02:59.920" style="s2">types of logic that in umber slee then</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.340" end="00:03:09.489" style="s2">denies and pretends doesn&#39;t exist so</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.920" end="00:03:11.830" style="s2">without further ado let us start okay so</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.489" end="00:03:16.780" style="s2">served logic I think two dates right</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.830" end="00:03:19.300" style="s2">what&#39;s wrong whatever okay so season one</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.780" end="00:03:21.160" style="s2">is we&#39;re still exploring this meme this</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.300" end="00:03:24.670" style="s2">was season one Gnostic warfare for those</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.160" end="00:03:26.650" style="s2">who are new season two is devouring</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.670" end="00:03:29.860" style="s2">humanism as I said in Episode two is</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.650" end="00:03:32.170" style="s2">going to focus on these parts of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.860" end="00:03:34.239" style="s2">meme so it&#39;s gonna focus on the saying</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.170" end="00:03:35.830" style="s2">terrorism it&#39;s like car accidents ergo</p>

<p begin="00:03:44.530" end="00:03:49.120" style="s2">are unable to resolve and that&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.030" end="00:03:51.040" style="s2">purpose sciencism which is the idea of</p>

<p begin="00:03:54.160" end="00:04:00.940" style="s2">to blend together orthogonality which</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.370" end="00:04:03.940" style="s2">means trying to represent multiple</p>

<p begin="00:04:03.940" end="00:04:08.170" style="s2">technically overlapping but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.980" end="00:04:10.209" style="s2">lot more to that and this is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.170" end="00:04:12.730" style="s2">critical part of the blue church and</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.209" end="00:04:15.549" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna examine why that&#39;s the case</p>

<p begin="00:04:19.959" end="00:04:25.210" style="s2">on it and it&#39;s effectively not liable</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.960" end="00:04:26.979" style="s2">for its actions as we see in things like</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.210" end="00:04:29.710" style="s2">you know social media and Twitter and</p>

<p begin="00:04:41.050" end="00:04:47.590" style="s2">of subsystems which means if you take a</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.699" end="00:04:49.419" style="s2">complex machine and you break it down</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.590" end="00:04:53.050" style="s2">into subsystems you make those</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.419" end="00:04:55.870" style="s2">subsystems intentionally simple to</p>

<p begin="00:05:03.699" end="00:05:07.539" style="s2">core part of how the blue church</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.080" end="00:05:08.080" style="s2">infiltrates and takes over everything it</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.539" end="00:05:10.389" style="s2">touches</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.080" end="00:05:13.659" style="s2">so we&#39;ll be exploring all of this</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.389" end="00:05:15.669" style="s2">hilarious nests let&#39;s start with</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.659" end="00:05:17.770" style="s2">orthogonally which is the first and</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.669" end="00:05:20.860" style="s2">final oppressor of mankind that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.770" end="00:05:22.840" style="s2">weird thing to say but I promised Alex</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.860" end="00:05:25.690" style="s2">I&#39;ll get to it we&#39;ll start with the L</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.840" end="00:05:27.789" style="s2">which is an ancient name for the cubit</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.690" end="00:05:31.360" style="s2">the cubit was a very old way of</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.789" end="00:05:34.479" style="s2">measuring wealth so if you had stacks of</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.360" end="00:05:36.639" style="s2">cloth or stacks of gold or whichever you</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.479" end="00:05:38.740" style="s2">would use cubits to determine how much</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.639" end="00:05:41.620" style="s2">your trade was going to be especially on</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.740" end="00:05:44.349" style="s2">the Silk Road in antiquity now the thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.620" end="00:05:46.330" style="s2">about trying to measure how much gold is</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.349" end="00:05:48.310" style="s2">worth how much silk is worth how much</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.330" end="00:05:51.520" style="s2">cotton is that you don&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.310" end="00:05:53.199" style="s2">have an international standard to for</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.520" end="00:05:55.599" style="s2">metrics at this time in the Bronze Age</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.199" end="00:05:57.909" style="s2">the Chinese have one metric the Middle</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.599" end="00:05:59.800" style="s2">East as another Europe has another how</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.909" end="00:06:02.349" style="s2">do you bring it all together it&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.800" end="00:06:04.539" style="s2">it&#39;s not easy to say you know my cubits</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.349" end="00:06:06.940" style="s2">more cubit than your cubit and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.539" end="00:06:08.620" style="s2">that&#39;s just an endless argument so what</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.940" end="00:06:10.690" style="s2">they did is they started looking at</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.620" end="00:06:11.379" style="s2">their own bodies and they said well you</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.690" end="00:06:13.569" style="s2">know what</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.379" end="00:06:15.879" style="s2">no that&#39;s the spot between my elbow my</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.569" end="00:06:17.949" style="s2">finger that&#39;s pretty much the same</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.879" end="00:06:20.680" style="s2">everywhere we go in the world so we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.949" end="00:06:21.909" style="s2">just use that and this became the</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.680" end="00:06:24.669" style="s2">standard in which you measured your</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.909" end="00:06:27.039" style="s2">trade in you would you would measure you</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.669" end="00:06:29.409" style="s2">know how how many lengths between my</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.039" end="00:06:32.080" style="s2">elbow and my finger were we actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.409" end="00:06:35.259" style="s2">trading here and this was as close as</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.080" end="00:06:37.539" style="s2">you could get as at a universal metric</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.259" end="00:06:40.349" style="s2">system to conduct trade in a fair manner</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.539" end="00:06:43.180" style="s2">across systems which had totally</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.349" end="00:06:45.310" style="s2">incompatible metric systems between one</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.180" end="00:06:47.889" style="s2">another and it plus it was intuitive and</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.310" end="00:06:49.690" style="s2">it was hard to skimp on you know he</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.889" end="00:06:51.460" style="s2">couldn&#39;t just like grow your arm wasn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:06:52.700" end="00:06:58.820" style="s2">it&#39;s worked for a long time of course</p>

<p begin="00:06:58.820" end="00:07:03.860" style="s2">in the biblical and Bible as well being</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.890" end="00:07:06.200" style="s2">mentioned there and something</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.860" end="00:07:08.150" style="s2">interesting about this is that in</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.200" end="00:07:10.490" style="s2">addition to this being the the source of</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.150" end="00:07:12.920" style="s2">accounting this counting naturally leads</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.490" end="00:07:17.180" style="s2">to mathematics in fact that bone is</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.920" end="00:07:19.850" style="s2">called the radius and you know these two</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.180" end="00:07:22.460" style="s2">things we start to see that okay there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.850" end="00:07:25.670" style="s2">a variableness between the humerus and</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.460" end="00:07:27.770" style="s2">the radius now it looks like that oh my</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.670" end="00:07:29.750" style="s2">god we just figured out some basic</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.770" end="00:07:31.310" style="s2">geometry using our arm and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.750" end="00:07:32.780" style="s2">incentivized to do so because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.310" end="00:07:34.430" style="s2">already using this part of our arm for</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.780" end="00:07:35.750" style="s2">trade so now we start to see that</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.430" end="00:07:38.510" style="s2">there&#39;s a relationship between these</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.750" end="00:07:40.130" style="s2">lines because we&#39;re just doing all of</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.510" end="00:07:41.870" style="s2">our trade here all the time anyway and</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.130" end="00:07:43.580" style="s2">it&#39;s a reason that bone the radius is</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.870" end="00:07:46.010" style="s2">the radius here in mathematics as well</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.580" end="00:07:47.630" style="s2">this is the origin of the etymology or</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.010" end="00:07:52.100" style="s2">watching the origin of mathematics being</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.630" end="00:07:55.940" style="s2">born see the radius is right there now</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.100" end="00:07:57.500" style="s2">where do we get the orthogonal stuff</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.940" end="00:07:58.910" style="s2">this is very you know the radius could</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.500" end="00:08:00.710" style="s2">be anywhere in the circle but just like</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.910" end="00:08:02.930" style="s2">the arm could be anywhere within reason</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.710" end="00:08:04.970" style="s2">it&#39;s not like I can bend it this way and</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.930" end="00:08:06.500" style="s2">break myself but for the most part the</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.970" end="00:08:08.420" style="s2">idea that it was adjustable was a</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.500" end="00:08:10.160" style="s2">concept so where do we get two</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.420" end="00:08:13.070" style="s2">orthogonal means where do we get two</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.160" end="00:08:15.200" style="s2">intersecting lines or or right angles</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.070" end="00:08:17.900" style="s2">well again put ourselves in</p>

<p begin="00:08:17.900" end="00:08:24.260" style="s2">antiquity is almost impossible there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.290" end="00:08:26.480" style="s2">actually no way you a human being can</p>

<p begin="00:08:39.020" end="00:08:42.170" style="s2">measurements are off then everything you</p>

<p begin="00:08:57.440" end="00:09:01.190" style="s2">it is you&#39;re trying to do in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.970" end="00:09:02.960" style="s2">architecture in particular so how do we</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.190" end="00:09:04.730" style="s2">know this is a straight line well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.960" end="00:09:06.290" style="s2">because of gravity if we tie a</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.730" end="00:09:08.060" style="s2">heavyweight to this rope</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.290" end="00:09:10.100" style="s2">get a straight line the only straight</p>

<p begin="00:09:10.100" end="00:09:15.560" style="s2">antiquity so we can actually create we</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.130" end="00:09:17.630" style="s2">took this Platonic ideal of mathematics</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.560" end="00:09:19.639" style="s2">and we can actually create it in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.630" end="00:09:21.889" style="s2">real world we have a we have this</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.639" end="00:09:23.589" style="s2">mathematic ideal represented using this</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.889" end="00:09:26.420" style="s2">technique known as the plumb line</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.589" end="00:09:30.350" style="s2">now from this plumb line I can then</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.420" end="00:09:33.079" style="s2">figure out okay how straight how level</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.350" end="00:09:35.360" style="s2">am I am I being level we see this right</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.079" end="00:09:37.130" style="s2">now and like well not leveling it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.360" end="00:09:39.860" style="s2">different story but but this plumb line</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.130" end="00:09:41.600" style="s2">is a way to determine okay is anything</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.860" end="00:09:43.550" style="s2">off here if this was tilted this way</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.600" end="00:09:45.860" style="s2">then I wouldn&#39;t have the parallel that</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.550" end="00:09:48.680" style="s2">I&#39;m looking for so my building will</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.860" end="00:09:50.329" style="s2">collapse if these aren&#39;t parallel so I</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.680" end="00:09:52.220" style="s2">can very tightly carefully measure each</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.329" end="00:09:54.040" style="s2">brick as I go along the line and make</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.220" end="00:09:56.209" style="s2">sure that I&#39;m paralyzed with this</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.040" end="00:09:58.220" style="s2">reproducible constant that I can throw</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.209" end="00:09:59.779" style="s2">everywhere I need to throw it down this</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.220" end="00:10:02.240" style="s2">is incredibly useful and still used to</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.779" end="00:10:04.790" style="s2">this day in construction in fact this</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.240" end="00:10:07.279" style="s2">was so useful that very old</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.790" end="00:10:10.130" style="s2">civilizations and modern ones used it as</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.279" end="00:10:12.380" style="s2">well and you&#39;ll see this that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.130" end="00:10:15.649" style="s2">plumb line as well this is the point of</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.380" end="00:10:18.230" style="s2">reference in which you can do additional</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.649" end="00:10:21.370" style="s2">mathematics you can actually figure out</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.230" end="00:10:25.639" style="s2">ok how far is the star from where I&#39;m at</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.370" end="00:10:27.680" style="s2">the Patek could figure this out just</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.639" end="00:10:29.930" style="s2">from the plumb line alone and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.680" end="00:10:31.639" style="s2">you&#39;ll see in the medieval periods</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.930" end="00:10:34.639" style="s2">trying to measure how tall building is</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.639" end="00:10:37.120" style="s2">from the plumb line alone so this is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.639" end="00:10:39.769" style="s2">this is where we actually cross the</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.120" end="00:10:42.110" style="s2">ideals of mathematics and bring them</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.769" end="00:10:44.510" style="s2">into realities from this part alone and</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.110" end="00:10:45.920" style="s2">this is an orthogonal line by default</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.510" end="00:10:46.430" style="s2">this is why this line exists we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.920" end="00:10:48.500" style="s2">trying to create</p>

<p begin="00:10:48.500" end="00:10:53.660" style="s2">gravity itself so you have all of</p>

<p begin="00:10:53.660" end="00:10:57.230" style="s2">it&#39;s crazy to think about that but</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.399" end="00:11:01.310" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s absolutely the case it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.230" end="00:11:05.120" style="s2">one line and then furthermore about why</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.310" end="00:11:06.740" style="s2">the arm is used humans are pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.120" end="00:11:08.300" style="s2">at watching each other and observing</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.740" end="00:11:10.670" style="s2">each other and when they&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.300" end="00:11:12.560" style="s2">figure out this problem of of measuring</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.670" end="00:11:14.689" style="s2">how to conduct trade and make sure it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.560" end="00:11:15.860" style="s2">fair but they looked at all parts of</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.689" end="00:11:18.050" style="s2">their body they didn&#39;t just pick the</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.860" end="00:11:19.519" style="s2">radius because they it&#39;s bored one day</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.050" end="00:11:20.000" style="s2">and they said hey that&#39;s a good part of</p>

<p begin="00:11:20.000" end="00:11:25.010" style="s2">use it turns out when you measure the</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.520" end="00:11:28.570" style="s2">average distance differences between</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.010" end="00:11:31.160" style="s2">bodies and body links at the same age</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.570" end="00:11:32.930" style="s2">the radius is the least variation of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.160" end="00:11:35.420" style="s2">average so if you use the tibia the</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.930" end="00:11:37.070" style="s2">fibula or the humerus you have a greater</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.420" end="00:11:39.260" style="s2">variation of the average and so you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.070" end="00:11:41.150" style="s2">have more unfair trade the radius was</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.260" end="00:11:42.680" style="s2">actually the most stable out of all the</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.150" end="00:11:44.240" style="s2">bones and or I should say the least</p>

<p begin="00:18:55.109" end="00:19:00.340" style="s2">so i&#39;m gonna focus my criticism has been</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.999" end="00:19:03.759" style="s2">flippant so far so i&#39;m gonna focus on a</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.340" end="00:19:07.539" style="s2">very specific part of it i&#39;m gonna focus</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.759" end="00:19:11.200" style="s2">on that word right there now you might</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.539" end="00:19:13.239" style="s2">say pat come on you&#39;re just splitting</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.200" end="00:19:15.669" style="s2">hairs how are you gonna focus on a word</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.239" end="00:19:18.789" style="s2">to take down a comprehensive philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.669" end="00:19:21.340" style="s2">who really really got it right like how</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.789" end="00:19:23.320" style="s2">do you how how can you even do that and</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.340" end="00:19:27.489" style="s2">here&#39;s how i can do that because level</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.320" end="00:19:30.220" style="s2">implies measuring happiness right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.489" end="00:19:32.919" style="s2">the idea that we can put a number i have</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.220" end="00:19:34.869" style="s2">seven Happy&#39;s and tomorrow i have nine</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.919" end="00:19:38.710" style="s2">Happy&#39;s right so we&#39;re putting this</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.869" end="00:19:42.399" style="s2">level on it and why is this a problem</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.710" end="00:19:44.289" style="s2">well again the criticisms fair yes me</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.399" end="00:19:46.929" style="s2">fixating on a single word might be out</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.289" end="00:19:49.749" style="s2">of order but bear with me i&#39;m not the</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.929" end="00:19:53.190" style="s2">first to do this let&#39;s look at fellows</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.749" end="00:19:56.169" style="s2">cific calculus that was a thing so like</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.190" end="00:19:58.899" style="s2">john Daria&#39;s jeremy bentham once again</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.169" end="00:20:03.070" style="s2">coming up with an attempt to force fuck</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.899" end="00:20:06.460" style="s2">mathematics to comport to this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.070" end="00:20:07.749" style="s2">measuring happiness they believed the</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.460" end="00:20:09.580" style="s2">new moral rightness and wrongness of an</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.749" end="00:20:11.139" style="s2">action to be a function of the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.580" end="00:20:12.460" style="s2">pleasure or pain that is a function</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.139" end="00:20:15.039" style="s2">right a mathematical function a</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.460" end="00:20:17.289" style="s2">transformation of inputs to outputs as</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.039" end="00:20:19.690" style="s2">utility calculus he missed a calculus</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.289" end="00:20:22.059" style="s2">this type of thing here&#39;s all the things</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.690" end="00:20:24.549" style="s2">you know the duration and certainty and</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.059" end="00:20:26.580" style="s2">all the all the arbitrary factors that</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.549" end="00:20:28.749" style="s2">he put into this calculate or e method</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.580" end="00:20:30.429" style="s2">so basically that&#39;s forces the</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.749" end="00:20:32.049" style="s2">association of pleasure and pain as an</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.429" end="00:20:33.729" style="s2">orthogonal and I&#39;ll give you a</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.049" end="00:20:36.009" style="s2">demonstration of that because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.729" end="00:20:38.169" style="s2">enough to simply say that that pain is</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.009" end="00:20:39.429" style="s2">over here and pleasure is over here</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.169" end="00:20:43.090" style="s2">that&#39;s not enough it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.429" end="00:20:45.129" style="s2">orthogonal and I&#39;ll get into that and</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.090" end="00:20:47.799" style="s2">then exploit that mathematical Authority</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.129" end="00:20:49.359" style="s2">because it&#39;s math of course math is if</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.799" end="00:20:50.919" style="s2">you find anything in map and it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.359" end="00:20:52.179" style="s2">true for ever and ever right and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.919" end="00:20:54.489" style="s2">gonna turn pleasure-seeking into a</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.179" end="00:20:56.380" style="s2">full-blown political system that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.489" end="00:20:58.960" style="s2">it ends so look at that</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.380" end="00:21:00.820" style="s2">back here again Wow kind of strange it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.960" end="00:21:03.450" style="s2">your peak utility once again if heroin</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.820" end="00:21:05.920" style="s2">isn&#39;t enough call Epstein he&#39;ll up yep</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.450" end="00:21:09.700" style="s2">okay so here&#39;s that orthogonality I was</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.920" end="00:21:12.550" style="s2">talking about so this is much joy very</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.700" end="00:21:15.520" style="s2">pleased small join join should be join</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.550" end="00:21:18.190" style="s2">tiny pleased small pain tiny ouch much</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.520" end="00:21:20.860" style="s2">pain very out right so real bad a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.190" end="00:21:22.720" style="s2">pain not a lot of pain really a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.860" end="00:21:24.250" style="s2">pleasure not a lot of pleasure right so</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.720" end="00:21:27.280" style="s2">here&#39;s your orthogonality because again</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.250" end="00:21:28.690" style="s2">you can&#39;t just simply say pain is the</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.280" end="00:21:31.930" style="s2">absence of pleasure it&#39;s very possible</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.690" end="00:21:33.430" style="s2">to experience both at the same time if</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.930" end="00:21:36.250" style="s2">you&#39;re into that stuff it&#39;s also very</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.430" end="00:21:38.080" style="s2">positive it&#39;s also you know if you have</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.250" end="00:21:40.270" style="s2">not a lot of pleasure and not a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.080" end="00:21:42.220" style="s2">pain you&#39;re probably asleep you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.270" end="00:21:47.680" style="s2">that&#39;s a reality too so things happen</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.220" end="00:21:52.390" style="s2">right so it&#39;s orthogonal and this this</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.680" end="00:21:55.390" style="s2">right here is the line this is the plumb</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.390" end="00:21:58.150" style="s2">line of the blue church</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.390" end="00:22:00.370" style="s2">right so this is the plumb line that</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.150" end="00:22:02.530" style="s2">once I can establish it I can build the</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.370" end="00:22:05.140" style="s2">entirety of the right side of history</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.530" end="00:22:07.690" style="s2">narrative because I am getting I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.140" end="00:22:10.179" style="s2">maximizing pleasure and I am reducing</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.690" end="00:22:13.030" style="s2">pain and that is my moral authority and</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.179" end="00:22:16.990" style="s2">from that plumb line I can extract the</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.030" end="00:22:18.880" style="s2">entirety of everything afterwards so</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.990" end="00:22:19.990" style="s2">again it&#39;s called a blue church and</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.880" end="00:22:22.750" style="s2">there&#39;s a reason for that</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.990" end="00:22:24.910" style="s2">once you from a line you can create</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.750" end="00:22:26.559" style="s2">shapes from shapes you can make symbols</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.910" end="00:22:29.380" style="s2">and from symbols you can make churches</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.559" end="00:22:31.600" style="s2">so from this line I will be able to show</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.380" end="00:22:34.419" style="s2">you how to build a blue Church of your</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.600" end="00:22:35.919" style="s2">own oh and by the way and if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.419" end="00:22:37.330" style="s2">outside of that line you&#39;re your North</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.919" end="00:22:39.400" style="s2">Sea which I can&#39;t say anymore because</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.330" end="00:22:40.390" style="s2">you know everyone&#39;s listening so if</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.400" end="00:22:42.010" style="s2">you&#39;re if you don&#39;t like pain or</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.390" end="00:22:43.750" style="s2">pleasure you&#39;re still ignored see if you</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.010" end="00:22:46.240" style="s2">if you like a lot of pain and no joy</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.750" end="00:22:48.340" style="s2">you&#39;re a Protestant and satanic Nazis</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.240" end="00:22:50.169" style="s2">are apparently a thing now so you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.340" end="00:22:51.520" style="s2">just keep the hits coming but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.169" end="00:22:52.630" style="s2">supposed to stay here right this is</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.520" end="00:22:53.950" style="s2">where you&#39;re gonna be and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.630" end="00:22:56.290" style="s2">whole medley of reasons why you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.950" end="00:22:58.510" style="s2">forced here even against your will just</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.290" end="00:22:59.530" style="s2">like that Bentham prison where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.510" end="00:23:03.040" style="s2">gonna measure that happiness and</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.530" end="00:23:07.030" style="s2">goddamnit we&#39;re gonna keep you here so</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.040" end="00:23:09.549" style="s2">let&#39;s start with how a civilization kind</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.030" end="00:23:11.440" style="s2">of appears at a high level heuristic</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.549" end="00:23:13.030" style="s2">start with linguistics just people</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.440" end="00:23:15.490" style="s2">talking gratulations</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.030" end="00:23:16.870" style="s2">we&#39;re talking awesome we&#39;re green we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.490" end="00:23:18.070" style="s2">not being violent we&#39;re talking so</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.870" end="00:23:20.440" style="s2">that&#39;s a start we can probably build</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.070" end="00:23:23.049" style="s2">from there further so we get a you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.440" end="00:23:25.000" style="s2">we figure out political things just just</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.049" end="00:23:27.400" style="s2">a block button nowadays but we figure</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.000" end="00:23:30.250" style="s2">out political stuff cultural studies</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.400" end="00:23:32.049" style="s2">education we start to grow this</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.250" end="00:23:34.299" style="s2">linguistic capacity into these other</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.049" end="00:23:36.669" style="s2">ways of trying to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.299" end="00:23:40.140" style="s2">manage ourselves as our populations grow</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.669" end="00:23:42.520" style="s2">and as our experiences with nature grows</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.140" end="00:23:44.890" style="s2">education and linguistics naturally lead</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.520" end="00:23:46.059" style="s2">to philosophy philosophy leads and</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.890" end="00:23:47.830" style="s2">mathematics and the political process</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.059" end="00:23:49.990" style="s2">and cultural studies lead the geography</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.830" end="00:23:52.240" style="s2">because this is how you allocate your</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.990" end="00:23:54.669" style="s2">collective resources to claim land and</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.240" end="00:23:56.710" style="s2">have a base and a presence in these type</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.669" end="00:23:58.059" style="s2">of things meanwhile mathematics is over</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.710" end="00:24:00.160" style="s2">here just fucking off from philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.059" end="00:24:01.960" style="s2">Shen leaves the Natural Sciences</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.160" end="00:24:03.820" style="s2">geography then leads to economics and</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.960" end="00:24:04.840" style="s2">these lines flow back into each other by</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.820" end="00:24:06.910" style="s2">the way I should have pointed that out</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.840" end="00:24:08.530" style="s2">so it&#39;s not like linguistics leads a</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.910" end="00:24:09.159" style="s2">political process political process can</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.530" end="00:24:10.599" style="s2">also influence</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.159" end="00:24:11.830" style="s2">linguistics it&#39;s all back-and-forth</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.599" end="00:24:15.039" style="s2">everything can influence everything here</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.830" end="00:24:17.979" style="s2">an attention relationship to economics</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.039" end="00:24:20.499" style="s2">is a byproduct of geography as multiple</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.979" end="00:24:22.720" style="s2">actors upon the geographic sphere are</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.499" end="00:24:25.720" style="s2">now forced to use their arms to trade</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.720" end="00:24:27.970" style="s2">with one another natural natural</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.720" end="00:24:30.549" style="s2">sciences comes from mathematics finance</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.970" end="00:24:32.979" style="s2">as a result of economics this poor guy</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.549" end="00:24:34.479" style="s2">he just can&#39;t print fast enough gotta</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.979" end="00:24:36.789" style="s2">measure all that money in the debt and</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.479" end="00:24:39.279" style="s2">all that stuff that leads to the trades</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.789" end="00:24:41.080" style="s2">people were building stuff before all of</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.279" end="00:24:43.889" style="s2">this complicated thing yeah that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.080" end="00:24:46.720" style="s2">but in terms of like properly</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.889" end="00:24:48.970" style="s2">configurating and deploying labor in a</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.720" end="00:24:50.859" style="s2">way that was profitable you needed all</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.970" end="00:24:53.109" style="s2">this stuff in place first so you get to</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.859" end="00:24:54.970" style="s2">the trades and as like this like this</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.109" end="00:24:57.729" style="s2">vehicle this function of civilization</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.970" end="00:24:59.769" style="s2">that comes roughly after finance</p>

<p begin="00:25:01.239" end="00:25:06.519" style="s2">organized them as a fist then you have</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.359" end="00:25:08.499" style="s2">material sciences as the trades interact</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.519" end="00:25:10.809" style="s2">with the earth and find more stuff about</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.499" end="00:25:12.729" style="s2">nature they have questions and you want</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.809" end="00:25:14.739" style="s2">better things about the earth like I</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.729" end="00:25:17.049" style="s2">find some dirt now what if I apply fire</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.739" end="00:25:18.609" style="s2">to it oh I get no hardened clay and I</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.049" end="00:25:20.109" style="s2">can do stuff so these two things work</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.609" end="00:25:24.340" style="s2">together to actually generate material</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.109" end="00:25:28.299" style="s2">sciences and once we get here once we</p>

<p begin="00:25:36.249" end="00:25:42.159" style="s2">where the blue church line kinda comes</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.970" end="00:25:44.590" style="s2">from trying to figure out okay</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.159" end="00:25:47.080" style="s2">there&#39;s humans in this system how do i</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.590" end="00:25:47.590" style="s2">optimize for each one how do i make them</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.080" end="00:25:50.649" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.590" end="00:25:52.450" style="s2">how do i increase pleasure and reduce</p>

<p begin="00:25:52.450" end="00:25:58.040" style="s2">now it infects linguistics first we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:25:58.040" end="00:26:01.550" style="s2">linguistics and reduce the pain of</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.780" end="00:26:03.380" style="s2">linguistics we&#39;re gonna say there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:26:04.730" end="00:26:08.060" style="s2">and then we&#39;re gonna constantly change</p>

<p begin="00:26:08.060" end="00:26:11.510" style="s2">never really know what&#39;s going on and</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.290" end="00:26:14.030" style="s2">once we&#39;re successfully able to put a</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.510" end="00:26:16.760" style="s2">blue plumb line there well then we could</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.030" end="00:26:18.710" style="s2">spread out then we can do the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.760" end="00:26:20.810" style="s2">to the political process how do we</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.710" end="00:26:23.120" style="s2">maximize the pleasure of the political</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.810" end="00:26:24.500" style="s2">process and minimize the pain well we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.120" end="00:26:26.960" style="s2">gonna make sure you only vote for things</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.500" end="00:26:28.760" style="s2">that are good for you who cares who else</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.960" end="00:26:30.320" style="s2">gets affected it&#39;s your pain and your</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.760" end="00:26:32.390" style="s2">pleasure that matters so we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.320" end="00:26:33.950" style="s2">make that to normal now for cultural</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.390" end="00:26:36.140" style="s2">studies we want to increase the pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.950" end="00:26:38.360" style="s2">and reduce the pain how do we do that</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.140" end="00:26:40.610" style="s2">well there&#39;s certain there&#39;s certain</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.360" end="00:26:41.780" style="s2">cultures that we want to focus on and if</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.610" end="00:26:43.580" style="s2">certain cultures we&#39;re not gonna focus</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.780" end="00:26:46.670" style="s2">on because it&#39;s painful we&#39;re not gonna</p>

<p begin="00:26:46.670" end="00:26:51.920" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna focus on some some abstract</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.270" end="00:26:53.090" style="s2">representation of it some scapegoat</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.920" end="00:26:54.950" style="s2">version of it but we&#39;re not gonna focus</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.090" end="00:26:56.480" style="s2">on the real thing cuz if we did that</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.950" end="00:26:58.910" style="s2">we&#39;d be there all day so we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.480" end="00:27:01.220" style="s2">maximize the pleasure and not talk about</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.910" end="00:27:02.960" style="s2">that shit then we&#39;re gonna do the same</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.220" end="00:27:05.120" style="s2">thing to psychology and education and</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.960" end="00:27:07.160" style="s2">philosophy and before you know it it</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.120" end="00:27:09.350" style="s2">doesn&#39;t get here yet you&#39;d think it</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.160" end="00:27:10.910" style="s2">would go here but we saved this one for</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.350" end="00:27:12.260" style="s2">last cuz you got to get the whole of</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.910" end="00:27:14.390" style="s2">civilization before he can actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.260" end="00:27:16.250" style="s2">change it to you the geography of it so</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.390" end="00:27:17.900" style="s2">now we got to go from mathematics we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.250" end="00:27:19.730" style="s2">already targeted philosophy we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.900" end="00:27:22.550" style="s2">already got you to the utility guys in</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.730" end="00:27:24.590" style="s2">control of philosophy here great now</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.550" end="00:27:27.350" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna do math now we&#39;re coming to</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.590" end="00:27:30.110" style="s2">the realm of absurd logic where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.350" end="00:27:32.600" style="s2">selecting for math that makes us more</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.110" end="00:27:35.660" style="s2">pleasurable and math that creat that</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.600" end="00:27:37.700" style="s2">crease that drives pain throw it out the</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.660" end="00:27:39.920" style="s2">window so it&#39;s not enough to say well</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.700" end="00:27:42.230" style="s2">I&#39;m logical so I win that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.920" end="00:27:44.300" style="s2">sufficient the fact is there are plenty</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.230" end="00:27:45.710" style="s2">of logical conclusions in mathematics</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.300" end="00:27:47.870" style="s2">that are not the highlight or focus of</p>

<p begin="00:27:47.870" end="00:27:51.590" style="s2">ones that have been selected are those</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.340" end="00:27:55.040" style="s2">that have followed this blue line this</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.590" end="00:27:57.470" style="s2">plumb line mathematics that increase the</p>

<p begin="00:28:03.770" end="00:28:06.940" style="s2">I would say</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.220" end="00:28:12.710" style="s2">let&#39;s take relativity for example</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.679" end="00:28:15.059" style="s2">relativity has all kinds of fun</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.710" end="00:28:17.640" style="s2">terminology and concepts associated with</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.059" end="00:28:20.429" style="s2">it that are directly built somehow on</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.640" end="00:28:22.790" style="s2">all of these other pre-cut herb Lew</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.429" end="00:28:25.200" style="s2">Church plumb lines the idea that oh</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.790" end="00:28:27.059" style="s2">there is no fixed points there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.200" end="00:28:28.950" style="s2">fixed morality there&#39;s no fixed universe</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.059" end="00:28:30.809" style="s2">there&#39;s only everything in relation to</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.950" end="00:28:34.650" style="s2">each other well you can come to that</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.809" end="00:28:37.290" style="s2">conclusion as long as you can pre</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.650" end="00:28:39.540" style="s2">subvert all of these other effects of</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.290" end="00:28:41.550" style="s2">civilization because then when this guy</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.540" end="00:28:43.320" style="s2">makes its claim and says ah well we</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.550" end="00:28:44.730" style="s2">could take relativity and say yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.320" end="00:28:46.580" style="s2">here&#39;s some actual math behind it that</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.730" end="00:28:49.710" style="s2">works but then we&#39;re gonna create a</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.580" end="00:28:51.390" style="s2">sciencism culture about relativity and</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.710" end="00:28:53.790" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna use that as a narrative to</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.390" end="00:28:56.070" style="s2">to reinforce that everything&#39;s relative</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.790" end="00:28:57.900" style="s2">man lay back and chill what are you</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.070" end="00:28:59.910" style="s2">doing so that we&#39;d push that to the</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.900" end="00:29:01.530" style="s2">Natural Sciences let me push it the</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.910" end="00:29:03.990" style="s2">material then we push it to the trades</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.530" end="00:29:05.520" style="s2">before you know it you have finance with</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.990" end="00:29:09.660" style="s2">Goldman Sachs out there running around</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.520" end="00:29:11.700" style="s2">caring about what the LBG LGBT flag all</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.660" end="00:29:14.790" style="s2">of a sudden like where were they 30</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.700" end="00:29:17.700" style="s2">years ago right there&#39;s economics and</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.790" end="00:29:19.950" style="s2">then finally you get the geography so</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.700" end="00:29:23.309" style="s2">this is how a blue church infiltrates an</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.950" end="00:29:25.800" style="s2">entire civilization by simply selecting</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.309" end="00:29:27.809" style="s2">for what&#39;s pleasurable and preventing</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.800" end="00:29:29.700" style="s2">what&#39;s painful it&#39;s all it has to do</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.809" end="00:29:31.950" style="s2">let&#39;s see it&#39;s not this complicated</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.700" end="00:29:33.750" style="s2">conspiracy it&#39;s not like moo-ha-ha the</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.950" end="00:29:36.929" style="s2">top of the throne room and smoky cigar</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.750" end="00:29:39.210" style="s2">rooms it&#39;s a simple selection criteria</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.929" end="00:29:43.110" style="s2">you infiltrate a group and you simply</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.210" end="00:29:45.929" style="s2">say does this cause pleasure no get out</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.110" end="00:29:47.460" style="s2">yes you win all you have to do is define</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.929" end="00:29:49.140" style="s2">what pleasure is of course but then you</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.460" end="00:29:51.000" style="s2">got to stick to your guns and it&#39;s easy</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.140" end="00:29:53.700" style="s2">to do because well everybody wants</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.000" end="00:29:56.070" style="s2">pleasure it&#39;s like it&#39;s like arguing for</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.700" end="00:29:58.080" style="s2">the for the lowest IQ least Age person</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.070" end="00:29:59.340" style="s2">in the entirety of civilization using</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.080" end="00:30:01.350" style="s2">that as your foundation which is why</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.340" end="00:30:02.520" style="s2">this shit works all the time so this is</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.350" end="00:30:04.650" style="s2">how this is a blue church just</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.520" end="00:30:06.059" style="s2">infiltrates everything they use they use</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.650" end="00:30:11.000" style="s2">pleasure that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.059" end="00:30:11.000" style="s2">device no magic trick no nothing</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.100" end="00:30:18.160" style="s2">so now once they start infiltrating</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.049" end="00:30:19.929" style="s2">signs with this technique they there is</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.160" end="00:30:22.210" style="s2">a fun side effect where they can</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.929" end="00:30:23.830" style="s2">actually conflate science to moral</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.210" end="00:30:25.750" style="s2">authority so you could say well</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.830" end="00:30:27.070" style="s2">mathematics isn&#39;t biased and science</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.750" end="00:30:30.039" style="s2">isn&#39;t biased we have a whole team of</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.070" end="00:30:34.840" style="s2">people who aren&#39;t princes and kings and</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.039" end="00:30:36.370" style="s2">and people who aren&#39;t in the political</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.840" end="00:30:37.960" style="s2">process they&#39;re just scientists are</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.370" end="00:30:40.150" style="s2">observing nature and it&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.960" end="00:30:41.320" style="s2">make sure that we bind our behavior to</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.150" end="00:30:42.700" style="s2">what we know about nature and we</p>

<p begin="00:30:42.700" end="00:30:47.140" style="s2">because that&#39;s how we can get a moral</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.650" end="00:30:48.880" style="s2">authority that isn&#39;t corruptible because</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.140" end="00:30:51.150" style="s2">I can&#39;t Crump an atom I mean what&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:31:29.820" end="00:31:33.880" style="s2">okay so some scientists answer and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.110" end="00:31:36.010" style="s2">just a wall of crap that happens bro I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:32:11.350" end="00:32:17.500" style="s2">quality piece and man so now had this</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.230" end="00:32:18.850" style="s2">moral champion running around and then</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.500" end="00:32:20.440" style="s2">you have this block of text which</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.850" end="00:32:22.570" style="s2">actually has the answer in here</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.440" end="00:32:24.400" style="s2">somewhere in this mess is probably a</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.570" end="00:32:25.840" style="s2">pretty damn good argument of why you</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.400" end="00:32:28.210" style="s2">actually starved good</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.840" end="00:32:29.409" style="s2">been a crop storm or global warming or</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.210" end="00:32:31.450" style="s2">whatever is probably good answer in here</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.409" end="00:32:33.610" style="s2">but but this is what actually works now</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.450" end="00:32:35.770" style="s2">why does this work well that here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.610" end="00:32:38.289" style="s2">two people user who&#39;s our scientists who</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.770" end="00:32:39.760" style="s2">double as moral authorities who don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.289" end="00:32:41.380" style="s2">know it of course then they pretend to</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.760" end="00:32:45.039" style="s2">not know it and here&#39;s why they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.380" end="00:32:47.440" style="s2">liars because they made this piece they</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.039" end="00:32:51.090" style="s2">turned this motherfucker out and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.440" end="00:32:54.309" style="s2">right yeah but this is the audience</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.090" end="00:32:56.169" style="s2">man they hate words have you seen these</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.309" end="00:32:58.809" style="s2">people they hate where words hurt them</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.169" end="00:33:02.110" style="s2">like it like it hurt like physically</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.809" end="00:33:04.240" style="s2">causes pain to them to see words but</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.110" end="00:33:07.029" style="s2">they listen to the sad girl oh so sad so</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.240" end="00:33:08.440" style="s2">now the the whims of the people they</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.029" end="00:33:11.590" style="s2">don&#39;t care about this they care about</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.440" end="00:33:14.679" style="s2">this so how do I increase my public</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.590" end="00:33:16.690" style="s2">funding well I care about that tada</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.679" end="00:33:18.610" style="s2">so now you had these these supposedly</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.690" end="00:33:20.980" style="s2">impartial scientists and their moral</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.610" end="00:33:24.490" style="s2">authority well now they&#39;re just populist</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.980" end="00:33:25.809" style="s2">populist opportunists that&#39;s it so</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.490" end="00:33:27.279" style="s2">they&#39;re no longer outside of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.809" end="00:33:28.029" style="s2">political process they are part of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.279" end="00:33:29.830" style="s2">political process</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.029" end="00:33:35.080" style="s2">they are the political process</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.830" end="00:33:39.250" style="s2">effectively this of course leads to</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.080" end="00:33:41.080" style="s2">pattern recognition problems so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.250" end="00:33:44.020" style="s2">only certain people who are allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.080" end="00:33:46.659" style="s2">see patterns and everyone else is not</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.020" end="00:33:48.029" style="s2">authorized to see the pattern you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.659" end="00:33:49.720" style="s2">allowed to see the pattern only</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.029" end="00:33:50.980" style="s2">scientists are allowed to see the</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.720" end="00:33:53.110" style="s2">pattern the rest of your conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.980" end="00:33:56.580" style="s2">theorists here&#39;s what that looks like</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.110" end="00:33:59.380" style="s2">right side of history has some opinions</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.580" end="00:34:00.669" style="s2">says for maximum happiness because</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.380" end="00:34:02.799" style="s2">that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing we&#39;re increasing</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.669" end="00:34:05.260" style="s2">maximum happiness we&#39;ve forced racial</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.799" end="00:34:06.789" style="s2">integration not for most people that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.260" end="00:34:08.589" style="s2">probably like all right that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.789" end="00:34:09.790" style="s2">thing yeah that is a good thing I mean</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.589" end="00:34:11.619" style="s2">aside for the fact that it totally</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.790" end="00:34:13.720" style="s2">destroyed black communities and their</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.619" end="00:34:16.300" style="s2">ability to be economically you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.720" end="00:34:18.220" style="s2">robust aside from that then yeah it was</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.300" end="00:34:19.960" style="s2">great No it gave cheap labor to Ford</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.220" end="00:34:21.310" style="s2">gave cheap labor for the entire north</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.960" end="00:34:25.149" style="s2">yeah I made a lot of money off that</p>

<p begin="00:35:09.060" end="00:35:12.300" style="s2">you can&#39;t talk about the pattern and</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.200" end="00:35:14.070" style="s2">because you can&#39;t talk about the pattern</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.300" end="00:35:18.200" style="s2">we just gonna keep going</p>

<p begin="00:43:00.020" end="00:43:03.050" style="s2">you can actually actually simulate</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.640" end="00:43:05.240" style="s2">choice we can create the veneer of</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.050" end="00:43:07.730" style="s2">choice but what you&#39;re actually doing is</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.240" end="00:43:08.930" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re getting reactive safety</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.730" end="00:43:11.000" style="s2">because you&#39;re going to the safe to</p>

<p begin="00:43:11.000" end="00:43:14.390" style="s2">when you do this this actually allows</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.350" end="00:43:15.190" style="s2">for unlimited violence and let me let me</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.390" end="00:43:17.840" style="s2">show you how</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.190" end="00:43:21.350" style="s2">so here&#39;s right here&#39;s our poor NPCs</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.840" end="00:43:24.580" style="s2">options you can go to war he can deal</p>

<p begin="00:43:34.580" end="00:43:37.820" style="s2">did he really choose that or did he just</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.830" end="00:43:40.400" style="s2">not want to go to war</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.820" end="00:43:42.680" style="s2">did he really choose her did he just not</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.400" end="00:43:45.560" style="s2">want to lynch someone you know I mean</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.680" end="00:43:48.320" style="s2">was there choice what was the revelation</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.560" end="00:43:50.810" style="s2">of preferences here so we&#39;ve made our</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.320" end="00:43:52.160" style="s2">choice now we got a bum and having the</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.810" end="00:43:56.540" style="s2">shit kicked out of you now look another</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.160" end="00:43:58.340" style="s2">Victoria model did I choose her</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.540" end="00:44:01.520" style="s2">I didn&#39;t choose her I just didn&#39;t choose</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.340" end="00:44:04.790" style="s2">this guy I didn&#39;t know I&#39;m not making</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.520" end="00:44:07.369" style="s2">choices here look at this burning</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.790" end="00:44:09.020" style="s2">building and starving kidding some sex</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.369" end="00:44:11.630" style="s2">kitten okay there bang</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.020" end="00:44:12.109" style="s2">okay look connected the NPC to pornhub</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.630" end="00:44:14.900" style="s2">we did it</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.109" end="00:44:17.060" style="s2">did he make these choices he didn&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.900" end="00:44:19.550" style="s2">those choices we just know what he</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.060" end="00:44:21.080" style="s2">didn&#39;t pick what if you replaced this</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.550" end="00:44:23.600" style="s2">low stuff he probably would have picked</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.080" end="00:44:25.910" style="s2">that too but these were hurt his choices</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.600" end="00:44:28.670" style="s2">so what you&#39;re doing is this is a</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.910" end="00:44:31.430" style="s2">simulation of happiness this isn&#39;t real</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.670" end="00:44:33.109" style="s2">happiness not by a long shot it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.430" end="00:44:34.820" style="s2">that this guy is a pervert who needs to</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.109" end="00:44:37.130" style="s2">fucking you know crank it every couple</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.820" end="00:44:38.710" style="s2">days or minutes or whatever this is a</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.130" end="00:44:40.780" style="s2">guy</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.710" end="00:44:42.369" style="s2">has no choice but to pick this because</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.780" end="00:44:43.839" style="s2">the option tree is laid before him from</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.369" end="00:44:45.670" style="s2">the morality machines and the blue line</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.839" end="00:44:47.980" style="s2">reinforcement has forced him down this</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.670" end="00:44:49.359" style="s2">road and as a result he&#39;s going down</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.980" end="00:44:51.730" style="s2">this road of false happiness and</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.359" end="00:44:53.770" style="s2">everything else is just collapsing</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.730" end="00:44:54.730" style="s2">around him and there&#39;s nothing he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.770" end="00:44:56.859" style="s2">going to do about it because he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.730" end="00:44:59.040" style="s2">obviously not going to pick the mess so</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.859" end="00:45:02.970" style="s2">he&#39;s allowing for unlimited violence and</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.040" end="00:45:02.970" style="s2">he&#39;s telling himself he&#39;s happy</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.540" end="00:45:09.830" style="s2">so now that he&#39;s established his happy</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.070" end="00:45:11.690" style="s2">path through the mess and the noise any</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.830" end="00:45:13.790" style="s2">threat to it becomes is equivalent to a</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.690" end="00:45:15.470" style="s2">mortal threat because he doesn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.790" end="00:45:19.820" style="s2">get dragged into that high conflict</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.470" end="00:45:21.710" style="s2">scenario so he doesn&#39;t want to get</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.820" end="00:45:23.180" style="s2">involved with this cuz you&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.710" end="00:45:24.440" style="s2">racist forever and there&#39;s no cure</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.180" end="00:45:26.030" style="s2">there&#39;s no there&#39;s nothing you just</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.440" end="00:45:27.740" style="s2">raises forever that&#39;s it right so he</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.030" end="00:45:30.800" style="s2">doesn&#39;t want to partake in that so he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.740" end="00:45:31.880" style="s2">not going to the more debt you rack up</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.800" end="00:45:36.440" style="s2">the more people they have to shoot</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.880" end="00:45:38.420" style="s2">that&#39;s a losing game I don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.440" end="00:45:42.320" style="s2">work to stay alive that&#39;s your job like</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.420" end="00:45:44.300" style="s2">oh man that&#39;s really it&#39;s like nothing</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.320" end="00:45:48.290" style="s2">you do matters everything you build will</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.300" end="00:45:49.940" style="s2">burn these are things if he was forced</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.290" end="00:45:52.190" style="s2">to address any of these it&#39;s just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.940" end="00:45:54.170" style="s2">be like oh man he has no experience in</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.190" end="00:45:56.750" style="s2">dealing with this stuff either there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.170" end="00:45:57.980" style="s2">no point of reference you know then</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.750" end="00:45:59.240" style="s2">there&#39;s you know the suffering of this</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.980" end="00:46:00.890" style="s2">person&#39;s more important than yours so</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.240" end="00:46:03.770" style="s2">now you&#39;re rationalizing why you should</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.890" end="00:46:05.060" style="s2">dehumanize yourself and if you do speak</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.770" end="00:46:06.440" style="s2">up well there&#39;s always this guy waiting</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.060" end="00:46:08.990" style="s2">to pull me into the ground for not</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.440" end="00:46:11.240" style="s2">speaking correctly at the right turn and</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.990" end="00:46:13.760" style="s2">so what we&#39;ve done is by creating by</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.240" end="00:46:17.780" style="s2">optimizing for happiness by selecting</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.760" end="00:46:19.280" style="s2">the maximum amount of happiness what</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.780" end="00:46:23.530" style="s2">we&#39;ve done is we&#39;ve created a blue</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.280" end="00:46:26.810" style="s2">church Pei Pig that&#39;s what we&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.530" end="00:46:28.670" style="s2">we&#39;ve created this dog in a human the</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.810" end="00:46:31.670" style="s2">stack is right there all he has to do is</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.670" end="00:46:36.770" style="s2">bite it but we won&#39;t let him it&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.670" end="00:46:38.990" style="s2">there he&#39;s a pay Pig pay me you Pig or</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.770" end="00:46:40.970" style="s2">this will happen to you so this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.990" end="00:46:43.490" style="s2">happiness he&#39;s not selecting for</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.970" end="00:46:46.430" style="s2">happiness but the blue church can tell</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.490" end="00:46:47.720" style="s2">you that he is because we&#39;ve optimized</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.430" end="00:46:49.910" style="s2">for it and this is what it is this is</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.720" end="00:46:53.180" style="s2">the Bentham prison this is the Bentham&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.910" end="00:46:57.190" style="s2">panopticon prison established to create</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.180" end="00:46:57.190" style="s2">this self monitoring prisoner</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.560" end="00:47:01.860" style="s2">so now that we know how the prison works</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.480" end="00:47:03.600" style="s2">and we know the problems of selecting</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.860" end="00:47:07.620" style="s2">for the blue line above all other things</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.600" end="00:47:10.950" style="s2">and selecting for happiness how do we</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.620" end="00:47:13.290" style="s2">undo it how do we reverse all that now</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.950" end="00:47:15.810" style="s2">yeah we could approach this with a a</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.290" end="00:47:18.030" style="s2">very structured philosophical view and</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.810" end="00:47:19.770" style="s2">we could use Marxism and we can do</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.030" end="00:47:21.030" style="s2">critical theory and we can do right side</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.770" end="00:47:22.260" style="s2">of it yeah we could do more blue chart</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.030" end="00:47:25.050" style="s2">shit sure yeah we could do that too a</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.260" end="00:47:28.110" style="s2">blue in the face but what I&#39;m doing is</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.050" end="00:47:29.730" style="s2">is pointing out absurd logic and the</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.110" end="00:47:31.110" style="s2">only way to beat logic is use something</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.730" end="00:47:33.270" style="s2">that is absolutely not logical at all</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.110" end="00:47:35.700" style="s2">and I&#39;m gonna use alchemy because</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.270" end="00:47:37.980" style="s2">there&#39;s no logic in alchemy because if</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.700" end="00:47:39.780" style="s2">the people who are selecting for certain</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.980" end="00:47:43.530" style="s2">types of logic this absurd logic system</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.780" end="00:47:46.560" style="s2">that I&#39;ve pointed out they have no skill</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.530" end="00:47:48.480" style="s2">no no understanding of this stuff they</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.560" end="00:47:50.100" style="s2">have no talent in it whatsoever and they</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.480" end="00:47:52.590" style="s2">can&#39;t actually use it and fight against</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.100" end="00:47:55.320" style="s2">it so what I&#39;m gonna show you is how to</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.590" end="00:47:58.140" style="s2">use alchemical comprehension a very</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.320" end="00:48:01.410" style="s2">small snippet of it to reverse the</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.140" end="00:48:02.970" style="s2">domestication of human beings now some</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.410" end="00:48:04.890" style="s2">people would call this radicalizing</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.970" end="00:48:07.560" style="s2">terrorists I call it temporarily</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.890" end="00:48:09.300" style="s2">suspending domestication I intend for</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.560" end="00:48:12.720" style="s2">people to go back to being domesticated</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.300" end="00:48:16.410" style="s2">afterwards but this is how you do it</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.720" end="00:48:19.290" style="s2">from an alchemical position a wolf pack</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.410" end="00:48:22.920" style="s2">plus copper I&#39;m pretty sure I just lost</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.290" end="00:48:24.810" style="s2">you a wolf pack plus copper equals R Pei</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.920" end="00:48:28.020" style="s2">Pig</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.810" end="00:48:31.500" style="s2">the inverse is also true if I remove the</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.020" end="00:48:33.270" style="s2">copper I get the Wolfpack back now what</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.500" end="00:48:34.440" style="s2">the fuck does that mean right that all</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.270" end="00:48:36.450" style="s2">right now I&#39;ve already jump the ship of</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.440" end="00:48:38.100" style="s2">logic but I told you I would I said I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.450" end="00:48:40.110" style="s2">not going to use logic I&#39;m going to use</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.100" end="00:48:42.350" style="s2">like semblances of it but I&#39;m not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.110" end="00:48:44.820" style="s2">use like this like structured thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.350" end="00:48:46.380" style="s2">first you&#39;re probably stuck here right</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.820" end="00:48:48.030" style="s2">you don&#39;t know what copper what I what I</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.380" end="00:48:49.680" style="s2">mean copper like like I hit you in a</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.030" end="00:48:51.960" style="s2">penny like I hit a wolf with a penny and</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.680" end="00:48:54.650" style="s2">you know that&#39;s not what I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.960" end="00:48:57.510" style="s2">gotta understand the alchemy of copper</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.650" end="00:48:59.270" style="s2">so this is a modern alchemical symbol</p>

<p begin="00:49:53.880" end="00:49:59.960" style="s2">was intrinsic but Venus was never a</p>

<p begin="00:50:14.820" end="00:50:19.530" style="s2">pigs back in the Wolves this is what I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:50:31.410" end="00:50:36.420" style="s2">line mechanism and we realize that</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.290" end="00:50:40.400" style="s2">instead of selecting for any one of</p>

<p begin="00:50:40.400" end="00:50:46.560" style="s2">happiness any one of these directions is</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.320" end="00:50:48.450" style="s2">actually straight up dehumanization only</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.560" end="00:50:50.970" style="s2">the feminine energy would pick this</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.450" end="00:50:53.580" style="s2">because to them and to that energy in</p>

<p begin="00:50:53.580" end="00:50:59.700" style="s2">but did I energy maximizing happiness is</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.760" end="00:51:04.470" style="s2">what you want to do that&#39;s exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.700" end="00:51:08.160" style="s2">you want to do maybe a mother watching</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.470" end="00:51:09.330" style="s2">over children a woman trying to piece</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.160" end="00:51:12.360" style="s2">together a community that&#39;s been</p>

<p begin="00:51:26.850" end="00:51:30.720" style="s2">is dehumanization you go further in any</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.820" end="00:51:33.980" style="s2">one of these just straight-up</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.720" end="00:51:37.560" style="s2">dehumanization that&#39;s where you end up</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.980" end="00:51:40.320" style="s2">let&#39;s just start with being alive let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.560" end="00:51:42.230" style="s2">not talk about optimizing or trying to</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.320" end="00:51:45.240" style="s2">create a better or anything let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.230" end="00:51:47.700" style="s2">just start with alive right where</p>

<p begin="00:51:49.830" end="00:51:56.010" style="s2">and then if you find that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.760" end="00:51:58.260" style="s2">drifting towards here everything syncing</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.010" end="00:51:59.970" style="s2">issues you&#39;re trying to bring it back</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.260" end="00:52:01.290" style="s2">you&#39;re not trying to eliminate pain</p>

<p begin="00:52:01.290" end="00:52:06.780" style="s2">pleasure you&#39;re trying to understand why</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.870" end="00:52:08.250" style="s2">your model of the world isn&#39;t sinking so</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.780" end="00:52:10.170" style="s2">much with what you think it should be</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.250" end="00:52:11.780" style="s2">and you got to work that you need some</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.170" end="00:52:13.890" style="s2">tools to help you figure that one out</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.780" end="00:52:15.150" style="s2">and if you just say fuck and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.890" end="00:52:16.440" style="s2">need the tools you just keep going</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.150" end="00:52:17.970" style="s2">that&#39;s just straight applies you just</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.440" end="00:52:19.440" style="s2">you know you care about you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.970" end="00:52:20.790" style="s2">maximizing for any one of these things</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.440" end="00:52:22.230" style="s2">that supposed to bring you back and then</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.790" end="00:52:24.270" style="s2">that will always cascade in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.230" end="00:52:28.800" style="s2">dehumanization until an opposing force</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.270" end="00:52:31.380" style="s2">drags you back in and by the way this is</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.800" end="00:52:34.510" style="s2">inverting by removing the leylines Venus</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.380" end="00:52:36.670" style="s2">what we end up with is the</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.510" end="00:52:38.410" style="s2">we end up with no longer selecting for</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.670" end="00:52:41.710" style="s2">happiness we&#39;re actually selecting for</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.410" end="00:52:44.260" style="s2">equilibrium instead now that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.710" end="00:52:46.300" style="s2">that&#39;s transitory it&#39;s not that Venus is</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.260" end="00:52:48.220" style="s2">removed and thus everything&#39;s cure if</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.300" end="00:52:49.450" style="s2">you remove the leylines of Venus</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.220" end="00:52:51.430" style="s2">something is obviously going to take its</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.450" end="00:52:52.960" style="s2">place but for enough time to actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.430" end="00:52:54.550" style="s2">get our you know get our act together</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.960" end="00:52:55.840" style="s2">and think about all the stuff that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.550" end="00:52:57.910" style="s2">been going through in the past 200 years</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.840" end="00:53:00.370" style="s2">it&#39;s probably a good start to just get</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.910" end="00:53:04.240" style="s2">rid of that copper completely and by the</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.370" end="00:53:05.980" style="s2">way the inverse of copper was a less</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.240" end="00:53:09.990" style="s2">antimony</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.980" end="00:53:12.670" style="s2">which is actually known as the gray wolf</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.990" end="00:53:14.829" style="s2">so that&#39;s how you that&#39;s how you end up</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.670" end="00:53:17.740" style="s2">with that&#39;s how you use alchemy to get</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.829" end="00:53:19.420" style="s2">to the scenario that I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.740" end="00:53:22.119" style="s2">where you can undo the blue church line</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.420" end="00:53:23.650" style="s2">you remove the copper and you end up</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.119" end="00:53:25.660" style="s2">with the gray wolf you end up with the</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.650" end="00:53:27.460" style="s2">wolf pack that has to constantly balance</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.660" end="00:53:29.380" style="s2">itself out it has to stay alive it has</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.460" end="00:53:30.609" style="s2">to synchronize with each of its own and</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.380" end="00:53:32.710" style="s2">if any of them step in the bicep that</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.609" end="00:53:34.720" style="s2">that community will pull you back in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.710" end="00:53:36.640" style="s2">Wolves work together the Wolves work in</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.720" end="00:53:38.170" style="s2">a pack when you were selecting for</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.640" end="00:53:40.030" style="s2">maximization you were working as an</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.170" end="00:53:40.990" style="s2">individual you were working alone of</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.030" end="00:53:42.369" style="s2">course it&#39;s gonna maximize your</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.990" end="00:53:45.040" style="s2">happiness because you don&#39;t have a pack</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.369" end="00:53:47.500" style="s2">so remove the leylines</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.040" end="00:53:58.150" style="s2">you get the gray wolf and that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.500" end="00:54:00.460" style="s2">thanks for listening alright so um if</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.150" end="00:54:04.750" style="s2">you have any questions drop them in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.460" end="00:54:06.579" style="s2">chat box for Pat and if you want me to</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.750" end="00:54:09.940" style="s2">read on your behalf I will do so just to</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.579" end="00:54:12.339" style="s2">indicate that so yeah that was um not</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.940" end="00:54:14.740" style="s2">even where to begin with that maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.339" end="00:54:16.119" style="s2">could like imagine some people watching</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.740" end="00:54:19.000" style="s2">this and I think okay jump the shark</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.119" end="00:54:21.040" style="s2">when you mentioned alchemy stuff could</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.000" end="00:54:23.140" style="s2">you like I like a 101 and alchemy and</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.040" end="00:54:25.960" style="s2">how you personally came across that in</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.140" end="00:54:28.390" style="s2">your journey yes my usage of alchemy</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.960" end="00:54:30.069" style="s2">isn&#39;t to be some warlock or some witch</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.390" end="00:54:30.880" style="s2">moo-ha-ha with burning candles that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.069" end="00:54:33.940" style="s2">not what I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.880" end="00:54:37.300" style="s2">alchemy is a very old system of</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.940" end="00:54:40.079" style="s2">epistemic very old so imagine once upon</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.300" end="00:54:43.060" style="s2">a time that humans didn&#39;t have science</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.079" end="00:54:44.859" style="s2">and so they don&#39;t have science so</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.060" end="00:54:46.300" style="s2">therefore they can&#39;t make sense at the</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.859" end="00:54:48.339" style="s2">universe that&#39;s not true you can&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.300" end="00:54:49.750" style="s2">that statement they do make sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.339" end="00:54:52.089" style="s2">universe and we know that because we</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.750" end="00:54:53.800" style="s2">exist now they made sense they made</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.089" end="00:54:55.750" style="s2">enough sense of the universe to breed us</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.800" end="00:54:57.670" style="s2">into existence they did that without</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.750" end="00:55:00.010" style="s2">science so therefore they had some</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.670" end="00:55:03.069" style="s2">comprehension of epistemic stew get us</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.010" end="00:55:04.839" style="s2">to this point the clean cut that&#39;s tried</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.069" end="00:55:06.069" style="s2">that Newt that the blue church likes to</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.839" end="00:55:07.569" style="s2">say and says oh everything is</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.069" end="00:55:10.839" style="s2">superstitious except my blue line</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.569" end="00:55:11.680" style="s2">science that&#39;s just them ashamed of</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.839" end="00:55:13.960" style="s2">their point of origin</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.680" end="00:55:16.810" style="s2">alchemy is how they got that science for</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.960" end="00:55:19.600" style="s2">starters so the other reason I pick it</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.810" end="00:55:22.060" style="s2">is because it is such a massive</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.600" end="00:55:23.740" style="s2">thousands of years of epistemic s&#39; if I</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.060" end="00:55:25.660" style="s2">had an AI and I was trying to understand</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.740" end="00:55:27.550" style="s2">human epistemic s&#39; I wouldn&#39;t start with</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.660" end="00:55:29.560" style="s2">now I wouldn&#39;t look at now and say oh</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.550" end="00:55:31.210" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna use now as a snapshot to</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.560" end="00:55:33.760" style="s2">figure out the entire epistemic base of</p>

<p begin="00:56:28.720" end="00:56:33.700" style="s2">alchemy because the blue church has no</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.640" end="00:56:34.780" style="s2">fucking idea how to deal with it and how</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.700" end="00:56:38.170" style="s2">did you stumble on it</p>

<p begin="00:56:38.170" end="00:56:43.140" style="s2">something that was huge and I realized</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.970" end="00:56:46.000" style="s2">my entire approach was wrong and so I</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.140" end="00:56:49.540" style="s2">concluded that to get what I want I had</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.000" end="00:56:51.130" style="s2">to steer civilization and the only way</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.540" end="00:56:53.500" style="s2">to do that was through alchemy which is</p>

<p begin="00:56:53.500" end="00:56:55.990" style="s2">I had to deal with which has no</p>

<p begin="00:56:57.190" end="00:57:03.630" style="s2">stupid soul alchemy is the specific kind</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.290" end="00:57:06.070" style="s2">that I picked</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.630" end="00:57:10.150" style="s2">do you ever explain it like I&#39;m five</p>

<p begin="00:57:18.580" end="00:57:22.680" style="s2">that system was built upon you have to</p>

<p begin="00:57:22.680" end="00:57:28.619" style="s2">what&#39;s the alchemy stuff so everything I</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.069" end="00:57:33.029" style="s2">was just saying before before the chat</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.619" end="00:57:37.309" style="s2">now still went over my head I see so</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.029" end="00:57:37.309" style="s2">imagine a world where you had 200 words</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.730" end="00:57:43.140" style="s2">so instead of the 20,000 words you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.380" end="00:57:47.040" style="s2">now on average you only have 200 can you</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.140" end="00:57:48.410" style="s2">describe the universe the answer is yes</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.040" end="00:57:50.700" style="s2">you can</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.410" end="00:57:52.410" style="s2">adding more words doesn&#39;t describe the</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.700" end="00:57:54.510" style="s2">universe better it just describes it at</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.410" end="00:57:56.430" style="s2">a better resolution it doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.510" end="00:57:58.260" style="s2">there&#39;s parts of the universe you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.430" end="00:58:00.150" style="s2">conceive of all the stuff we&#39;re running</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.260" end="00:58:01.920" style="s2">around today with or just rehashes of</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.150" end="00:58:04.730" style="s2">the Grecians anyway from 2,000 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.920" end="00:58:09.060" style="s2">and they didn&#39;t even have a telescope so</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.730" end="00:58:11.490" style="s2">what is what is our reasoning capability</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.060" end="00:58:13.380" style="s2">is it bits is it bytes is it science is</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.490" end="00:58:15.900" style="s2">it math is it logic no it&#39;s none of</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.380" end="00:58:18.000" style="s2">those things that is derivative of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.900" end="00:58:20.370" style="s2">human cognition derivative of human</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.000" end="00:58:22.860" style="s2">experience so if you want to start with</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.370" end="00:58:25.680" style="s2">how we got to science you have to start</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.860" end="00:58:27.510" style="s2">with where we started with which was our</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.680" end="00:58:33.840" style="s2">chemical understanding incomplete</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.510" end="00:58:35.120" style="s2">knowledge dark fragmented artisanal</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.840" end="00:58:37.560" style="s2">guilds of knowledge and information</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.120" end="00:58:42.600" style="s2">that&#39;s how we got started on knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.560" end="00:58:45.090" style="s2">so alchemy is a is a ecosystem of</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.600" end="00:58:49.370" style="s2">attempts it&#39;s like proto epistemology</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.090" end="00:58:49.370" style="s2">it&#39;s probably easiest way to describing</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.420" end="00:58:55.290" style="s2">so 10 generals lost asked about explain</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.940" end="00:58:57.140" style="s2">it like I&#39;m five about the copper thing</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.290" end="00:58:59.850" style="s2">and Andrea also had a related question</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.140" end="00:59:02.520" style="s2">which was I was hoping to follow up on</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.850" end="00:59:04.380" style="s2">what if you can reactivate the copper</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.520" end="00:59:09.540" style="s2">but Andrew maybe you can go off mute and</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.380" end="00:59:13.550" style="s2">ask your question to Pat okay my video</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.540" end="00:59:16.980" style="s2">on um what are some like practical like</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.550" end="00:59:19.290" style="s2">examples of what it would mean to remove</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.980" end="00:59:21.470" style="s2">the copper like what&#39;s like a practical</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.290" end="00:59:21.470" style="s2">everyday</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.280" end="00:59:29.760" style="s2">yeah what&#39;s what like what&#39;s practical</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.110" end="00:59:33.360" style="s2">everyday examples of removing the copper</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.760" end="00:59:37.250" style="s2">of like not maximizing happiness sure so</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.360" end="00:59:39.780" style="s2">a very simple trick you would do is</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.250" end="00:59:41.580" style="s2">whether any action you you would start</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.780" end="00:59:42.990" style="s2">with picking a random action not even</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.580" end="00:59:44.730" style="s2">every action that&#39;s too much discipline</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.990" end="00:59:46.500" style="s2">pick a random one like one a day or</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.730" end="00:59:49.710" style="s2">whatever you&#39;re about to do something</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.500" end="00:59:51.520" style="s2">and you&#39;d stop yourself and you say you</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.710" end="00:59:53.350" style="s2">know you do the do the the net flow</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.520" end="00:59:54.610" style="s2">does this bring joy right that all that</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.350" end="00:59:57.130" style="s2">old meme that was floating around for a</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.610" end="00:59:58.870" style="s2">while but instead of asking that quest</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.130" end="01:00:00.430" style="s2">that question but instead of using it as</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.870" end="01:00:01.570" style="s2">a filter to say okay well I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.430" end="01:00:04.600" style="s2">keep doing this or I&#39;m going to throw</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.570" end="01:00:06.529" style="s2">stuff out if it does bring you joy don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.600" end="01:00:09.779" style="s2">do it</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.529" end="01:00:11.609" style="s2">just don&#39;t do it and the reason you do</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.779" end="01:00:13.769" style="s2">that is to start training your brain and</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.609" end="01:00:14.579" style="s2">to understand reality from a different</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.769" end="01:00:17.039" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.579" end="01:00:18.809" style="s2">not necessarily to end up like Diogenes</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.039" end="01:00:21.200" style="s2">on the street with you know no clothes</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.809" end="01:00:24.210" style="s2">and dirt and stuff like that but to deny</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.200" end="01:00:27.059" style="s2">yourself on your own terms</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.210" end="01:00:28.079" style="s2">pleasure will give you access to parts</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.059" end="01:00:30.390" style="s2">your brain you never thought possible</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.079" end="01:00:31.740" style="s2">you have to keep doing it though it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.390" end="01:00:33.869" style="s2">not obvious and it&#39;s not easy because</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.740" end="01:00:35.460" style="s2">most of us are trained to if people are</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.869" end="01:00:37.200" style="s2">coming after our ability to maximize</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.460" end="01:00:39.299" style="s2">pressure we are trained with every</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.200" end="01:00:41.490" style="s2">manner of fight in us to prevent that</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.299" end="01:00:43.200" style="s2">from happening we can go to the state we</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.490" end="01:00:44.609" style="s2">can go to the we can go to social media</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.200" end="01:00:46.380" style="s2">we can do all these things and say oh</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.609" end="01:00:48.869" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna get you you stop my happiness</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.380" end="01:00:50.220" style="s2">how dare you I&#39;m tell Dad but in reality</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.869" end="01:00:52.440" style="s2">the only one who can stop you from</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.220" end="01:00:54.809" style="s2">pursuing happiness is yourself and if</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.440" end="01:00:58.200" style="s2">you don&#39;t know how to do that</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.809" end="01:00:59.880" style="s2">it&#39;s a good skill to learn and so I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.200" end="01:01:01.349" style="s2">start there for a daily practical stuff</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.880" end="01:01:07.859" style="s2">it&#39;s small stuff but it builds up over</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.349" end="01:01:09.900" style="s2">time okay there&#39;s a question to wait on</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.859" end="01:01:12.390" style="s2">someone&#39;s behalf Patrick give you copper</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.900" end="01:01:16.039" style="s2">removal as imminent and if so how do you</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.390" end="01:01:16.039" style="s2">feel about Kipling&#39;s law of the jungle</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.730" end="01:01:25.019" style="s2">law of the law of the jungle is that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.579" end="01:01:28.109" style="s2">rehash of Hobbes Leviathan so it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.019" end="01:01:29.519" style="s2">kind of the idea that someone has to</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.109" end="01:01:31.019" style="s2">maximize the happiness because if</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.519" end="01:01:33.239" style="s2">everybody&#39;s maximizing their happiness</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.019" end="01:01:35.190" style="s2">then it&#39;s a mess but it&#39;s even a mess</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.239" end="01:01:36.779" style="s2">even if it is just one person maximizing</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.190" end="01:01:41.190" style="s2">happiness maximizing the happiness is</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.779" end="01:01:45.509" style="s2">what causes the messes so I mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.190" end="01:01:47.579" style="s2">there&#39;s many of many arguments that is</p>

<p begin="01:01:47.579" end="01:01:51.809" style="s2">of that blue line but in terms of</p>

<p begin="01:02:07.380" end="01:02:17.440" style="s2">patches O&#39;Malley you had a question yeah</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.350" end="01:02:19.650" style="s2">so it seems like the the tree on the</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.440" end="01:02:22.090" style="s2">dog&#39;s nose is analogous to the</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.650" end="01:02:23.920" style="s2">transcendent identity or like authentic</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.090" end="01:02:25.840" style="s2">mode of being one that would produce</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.920" end="01:02:27.340" style="s2">meaning that would inoculate the</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.840" end="01:02:30.609" style="s2">individual from the system like this</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.340" end="01:02:31.930" style="s2">this blue Turk system it seemed like</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.609" end="01:02:33.609" style="s2">that the treat on its nose it seemed</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.930" end="01:02:35.160" style="s2">like it&#39;s always waiting there for us to</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.609" end="01:02:37.990" style="s2">embrace it but it would require</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.160" end="01:02:39.640" style="s2">embracing pain for something that&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.990" end="01:02:41.920" style="s2">more important than happiness and if</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.640" end="01:02:43.900" style="s2">suffering is de facto bad then you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.920" end="01:02:45.820" style="s2">then stretching your belief systems is</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.900" end="01:02:48.280" style="s2">bad and doesn&#39;t take place so</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.820" end="01:02:50.260" style="s2">essentially you&#39;re saying getting people</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.280" end="01:02:52.119" style="s2">to believe and act out the notion that</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.260" end="01:02:54.730" style="s2">they&#39;re more than their identity is what</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.119" end="01:02:57.220" style="s2">we humanize is that that&#39;s right you are</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.730" end="01:03:00.250" style="s2">more than your identity because as in</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.220" end="01:03:02.470" style="s2">the in the previous episode we go very</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.250" end="01:03:04.119" style="s2">deeply into identity and heuristics of</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.470" end="01:03:07.420" style="s2">it and how that becomes control systems</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.119" end="01:03:11.140" style="s2">and that type of stuff so the treat is</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.420" end="01:03:12.970" style="s2">exactly as it&#39;s pretty close to it might</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.140" end="01:03:17.140" style="s2">be identical to what you&#39;re describing</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.970" end="01:03:18.520" style="s2">there the idea that hey you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.140" end="01:03:20.710" style="s2">to keep playing this game if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.520" end="01:03:22.060" style="s2">want to you can leave it anytime you</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.710" end="01:03:23.680" style="s2">just have to normal you don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.060" end="01:03:25.750" style="s2">normalize yourself to pain and invite</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.680" end="01:03:27.640" style="s2">abuse that&#39;s some blue church thinking</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.750" end="01:03:30.160" style="s2">bullshit where if you&#39;re allowed oh I</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.640" end="01:03:31.780" style="s2">took pain once and so now therefore</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.160" end="01:03:33.490" style="s2">there&#39;s an a million abusers around me</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.780" end="01:03:35.260" style="s2">come on give me a break that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.490" end="01:03:37.660" style="s2">mature relationship with you know your</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.260" end="01:03:39.790" style="s2">own goddamn existence pain happens it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.660" end="01:03:41.440" style="s2">real there&#39;s all shit&#39;s things dying on</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.790" end="01:03:43.150" style="s2">your body all the time my skin cells are</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.440" end="01:03:45.369" style="s2">dying every 7 seconds there&#39;s all kinds</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.150" end="01:03:49.210" style="s2">of death happening around me it&#39;s if</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.369" end="01:03:50.859" style="s2">this is part of being here we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.210" end="01:03:52.960" style="s2">have a choice we&#39;re kind of born here we</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.859" end="01:03:55.869" style="s2">it&#39;s we just along for the ride for the</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.960" end="01:03:58.090" style="s2">most part so being pain is okay it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.869" end="01:04:00.160" style="s2">okay like it&#39;s okay to say you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.090" end="01:04:02.109" style="s2">need pleasure all the goddamn time like</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.160" end="01:04:05.350" style="s2">that shouldn&#39;t be too radical of an ass</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.109" end="01:04:06.490" style="s2">but for most people at this so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.350" end="01:04:09.280" style="s2">really clever way of tricking people</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.490" end="01:04:11.710" style="s2">into enslaving themselves and like just</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.280" end="01:04:13.359" style="s2">by denying parts of reality I also think</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.710" end="01:04:16.470" style="s2">that the theological allegories to this</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.359" end="01:04:19.579" style="s2">are like suspicious and coincidental</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.470" end="01:04:21.289" style="s2">yeah I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.579" end="01:04:23.660" style="s2">it&#39;s definitely that to be said but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.289" end="01:04:25.609" style="s2">one of the more ideal control mechanisms</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.660" end="01:04:27.469" style="s2">for populations because it&#39;s insidious</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.609" end="01:04:28.910" style="s2">and because it gets buy-in so early on</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.469" end="01:04:30.349" style="s2">and you could just keep doing it as long</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.910" end="01:04:32.269" style="s2">as you put the veneer of happiness up</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.349" end="01:04:33.709" style="s2">all times for the maximum happiness bla</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.269" end="01:04:35.950" style="s2">bla bla we&#39;ve already seen what that</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.709" end="01:04:35.950" style="s2">looks like</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.200" end="01:04:47.869" style="s2">Lucas you had a question hey I was just</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.079" end="01:04:50.740" style="s2">wondering both the overlaps of alchemy</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.869" end="01:04:53.599" style="s2">and cybernetics theory because as I was</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.740" end="01:04:56.720" style="s2">going through my development I was more</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.599" end="01:04:59.059" style="s2">into the esoteric mystery traditions and</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.720" end="01:05:00.890" style="s2">then when I went over into cybernetic</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.059" end="01:05:03.200" style="s2">theory I know it&#39;s a lot of parallels I</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.890" end="01:05:05.329" style="s2">just want to know if you saw a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.200" end="01:05:08.690" style="s2">parallels and if you did where do you</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.329" end="01:05:10.609" style="s2">think they they were yes the other</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.690" end="01:05:12.319" style="s2">reason I picked alchemy I mean just to</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.609" end="01:05:14.450" style="s2">reiterate and reassert I&#39;m not picking</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.319" end="01:05:15.980" style="s2">alchemy for moo-ha-ha mystical points</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.450" end="01:05:18.230" style="s2">it&#39;s not like I&#39;m approaching this from</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.980" end="01:05:20.089" style="s2">a material human material humanist</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.230" end="01:05:21.740" style="s2">perspective so the reason I another</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.089" end="01:05:23.299" style="s2">reason I picked alchemy in addition to</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.740" end="01:05:25.430" style="s2">it being a massive collection of</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.299" end="01:05:27.529" style="s2">unexplored epistemology that you can you</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.430" end="01:05:31.099" style="s2">know do some good research on especially</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.529" end="01:05:33.499" style="s2">in pre science what human cognition is</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.099" end="01:05:35.140" style="s2">capable of which is the inverse of today</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.499" end="01:05:37.249" style="s2">because there&#39;s only a handful of</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.140" end="01:05:39.980" style="s2">variations of human cognition that are</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.249" end="01:05:42.049" style="s2">allowed to be present the other benefit</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.980" end="01:05:45.319" style="s2">of alchemy is that it exclusively sees</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.049" end="01:05:48.980" style="s2">the world as black boxes exclusively so</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.319" end="01:05:50.989" style="s2">I poke this thing I don&#39;t know what that</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.980" end="01:05:53.779" style="s2">thing is I may never know what that</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.989" end="01:05:55.700" style="s2">thing is but it produced an output so I</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.779" end="01:05:58.549" style="s2">poke the jellyfish and it moved away and</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.700" end="01:06:00.799" style="s2">it stung me okay I have a rough idea of</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.549" end="01:06:03.289" style="s2">what that black box now is I never turn</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.799" end="01:06:04.789" style="s2">around and try to get it&#39;ll open the</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.289" end="01:06:05.480" style="s2">damn thing and see what&#39;s going on in</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.789" end="01:06:06.890" style="s2">the black box</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.480" end="01:06:08.210" style="s2">alchemy gets you comfortable with the</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.890" end="01:06:10.069" style="s2">idea that you&#39;ll never know and you</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.210" end="01:06:11.930" style="s2">don&#39;t need to know there&#39;s no point in</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.069" end="01:06:13.190" style="s2">that but you need to know is that you</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.930" end="01:06:15.650" style="s2">poke it you get the output and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.190" end="01:06:17.839" style="s2">what cybernetics is - cybernetics is the</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.650" end="01:06:19.789" style="s2">study of saying I what is a population</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.839" end="01:06:21.440" style="s2">right what what is a hundred million</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.789" end="01:06:23.329" style="s2">people do I poke a hundred million</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.440" end="01:06:24.380" style="s2">people do I need to open up every person</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.329" end="01:06:26.420" style="s2">to figure out a pond no you don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.380" end="01:06:28.279" style="s2">to do any of that stuff so you poke you</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.420" end="01:06:30.440" style="s2">treat the population as a black box you</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.279" end="01:06:32.210" style="s2">poke it out you go the same things true</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.440" end="01:06:33.619" style="s2">of neural networks unexplained neural</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.210" end="01:06:36.079" style="s2">networks are identical to the process</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.619" end="01:06:38.359" style="s2">I&#39;m talking about where I send its input</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.079" end="01:06:40.039" style="s2">it does its categorizations it finds the</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.359" end="01:06:41.930" style="s2">correlations and it has its output I</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.039" end="01:06:43.460" style="s2">don&#39;t actually know what those hidden</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.930" end="01:06:46.249" style="s2">layers are called it&#39;s literally called</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.460" end="01:06:47.839" style="s2">hidden layers so I can&#39;t even know so</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.249" end="01:06:49.280" style="s2">how come he gets you comfortable with</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.839" end="01:06:51.530" style="s2">the idea that you don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.280" end="01:06:53.510" style="s2">as opposed to science which says I need</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.530" end="01:06:54.830" style="s2">infinite data at all times I don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.510" end="01:06:57.110" style="s2">how many data centers I have to build</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.830" end="01:06:59.270" style="s2">every five seconds and that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.110" end="01:07:00.410" style="s2">absurd that&#39;s an absurd unsustainable</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.270" end="01:07:02.300" style="s2">proposition when it comes to</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.410" end="01:07:06.650" style="s2">epistemology so alchemy is a much better</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.300" end="01:07:09.950" style="s2">suited well thank you yeah I appreciate</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.650" end="01:07:10.640" style="s2">it so here&#39;s a question I read on</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.950" end="01:07:12.800" style="s2">someone&#39;s behalf</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.640" end="01:07:14.960" style="s2">what would a wolf society look like is</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.800" end="01:07:18.230" style="s2">it like one Vulcans drop emotions and</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.960" end="01:07:19.460" style="s2">switch to logic no emotions that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.230" end="01:07:21.740" style="s2">they work well so that&#39;s how they work</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.460" end="01:07:23.180" style="s2">so well together they use their emotions</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.740" end="01:07:26.120" style="s2">their emotions are actually functional</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.180" end="01:07:27.560" style="s2">as opposed to being vanity the emotions</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.120" end="01:07:30.710" style="s2">we have are are purely for pleasure</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.560" end="01:07:33.200" style="s2">these days I have an emotion it&#39;s it&#39;s D</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.710" end="01:07:34.820" style="s2">hinge its unhinged from social</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.200" end="01:07:36.680" style="s2">consequence for the most part it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.820" end="01:07:38.210" style="s2">tied to my existence I just happen to</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.680" end="01:07:40.310" style="s2">have emotions it sounds like punishment</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.210" end="01:07:41.810" style="s2">if you ask me emotions not serving a</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.310" end="01:07:43.880" style="s2">function where they just happen to exist</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.810" end="01:07:45.140" style="s2">and it interferes with my ability to get</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.880" end="01:07:47.030" style="s2">high that sounds terrible that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.140" end="01:07:48.830" style="s2">absolutely that&#39;s punishment</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.030" end="01:07:51.500" style="s2">I don&#39;t want emotions in that context</p>

<p begin="01:11:40.490" end="01:11:45.590" style="s2">made that were really popularized were</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.590" end="01:11:49.130" style="s2">of like Syrian refugee camps for example</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.590" end="01:11:50.930" style="s2">that were really about kind of exposing</p>

<p begin="01:11:54.080" end="01:11:59.680" style="s2">think about the ability for the blue</p>

<p begin="01:11:59.680" end="01:12:08.330" style="s2">kind of its own ends they will that is</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.330" end="01:12:09.620" style="s2">when it comes to blue church every</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.330" end="01:12:11.450" style="s2">options on the table at all times</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.620" end="01:12:13.520" style="s2">because they only know one play and that</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.450" end="01:12:14.180" style="s2">is to maximize happiness by any means</p>

<p begin="01:12:14.180" end="01:12:21.050" style="s2">so yes VR is definitely leveraged in</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.030" end="01:12:23.450" style="s2">that regard but at the same time the</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.050" end="01:12:26.740" style="s2">thing about empathy is that if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.450" end="01:12:30.630" style="s2">misplaced it also breeds resentment</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.740" end="01:12:30.630" style="s2">it&#39;s got to be real careful with that</p>

<p begin="01:14:48.440" end="01:14:52.340" style="s2">actually actually using the separation</p>

<p begin="01:15:04.760" end="01:15:10.190" style="s2">they saw they saw Christ as just another</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.180" end="01:15:11.540" style="s2">Jewish radical and so they weren&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:15:11.540" end="01:15:16.160" style="s2">eyes they were they were killing Jews so</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.719" end="01:15:19.010" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s that whole part of it</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.160" end="01:15:20.350" style="s2">but there&#39;s a lot of that period of</p>

<p begin="01:15:50.469" end="01:15:54.159" style="s2">ask about the contrast between the</p>

<p begin="01:15:54.159" end="01:15:59.139" style="s2">versus the pursuit of pleasure because I</p>

<p begin="01:16:09.099" end="01:16:13.389" style="s2">this um I kind of think part of the</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.829" end="01:16:15.729" style="s2">dying the reason they&#39;re dying breed is</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.389" end="01:16:19.479" style="s2">also that they they fail to find a</p>

<p begin="01:16:21.039" end="01:16:28.689" style="s2">bridge the is op divide so do you think</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.659" end="01:16:30.909" style="s2">there could be a new philosophy or</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.689" end="01:16:33.550" style="s2">metaphysics to resolve this problem and</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.909" end="01:16:36.399" style="s2">is that what you&#39;re doing yes that is</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.550" end="01:16:38.019" style="s2">exactly what I&#39;m doing because this is</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.399" end="01:16:41.409" style="s2">how I was trying to solve the problem</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.019" end="01:16:43.659" style="s2">that I couldn&#39;t solve before the idea</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.409" end="01:16:46.030" style="s2">was to trick an AI into solving it for</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.659" end="01:16:47.349" style="s2">me and so I think that my approach is</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.030" end="01:16:50.289" style="s2">something that more people should be</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.349" end="01:16:52.899" style="s2">doing not just because I want the ego</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.289" end="01:16:56.320" style="s2">trip I don&#39;t I&#39;ll probably disappear</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.899" end="01:16:59.349" style="s2">into the woods somewhere but I think</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.320" end="01:17:01.689" style="s2">it&#39;s useful to consider that we are</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.349" end="01:17:04.629" style="s2">about to walk into a world where we have</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.689" end="01:17:06.579" style="s2">multipolar cognitions it&#39;s not just a</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.629" end="01:17:08.829" style="s2">monopoly on cognition that the human</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.579" end="01:17:10.929" style="s2">mind has had for five thousand years</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.829" end="01:17:14.050" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna have a eyes of various</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.929" end="01:17:15.969" style="s2">capacity and neuro chimera and all kinds</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.050" end="01:17:18.070" style="s2">of genetic horror shows that are just on</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.969" end="01:17:19.510" style="s2">display at all times and they&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.070" end="01:17:21.490" style="s2">to be solving problems that we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.510" end="01:17:23.590" style="s2">even see</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.490" end="01:17:25.750" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna be wild like you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.590" end="01:17:27.970" style="s2">have this like this ant bat slug banana</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.750" end="01:17:31.090" style="s2">brain bananas on that branch but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.970" end="01:17:33.490" style="s2">gonna be solving problems that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.090" end="01:17:35.020" style="s2">gonna be like the fuckin like n</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.490" end="01:17:39.340" style="s2">dimensional things we can&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.020" end="01:17:41.020" style="s2">comprehend so how do you make not even</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.340" end="01:17:42.700" style="s2">make sense of this world at that point</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.020" end="01:17:44.020" style="s2">making sense it&#39;s the last thing you</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.700" end="01:17:45.580" style="s2">want to do because you&#39;ll be too busy</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.020" end="01:17:46.900" style="s2">focusing all your resources on making</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.580" end="01:17:50.910" style="s2">sense you won&#39;t even be able to survive</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.900" end="01:17:53.140" style="s2">it so you&#39;re probably better off just</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.910" end="01:17:55.480" style="s2">embracing the idea that this is a</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.140" end="01:17:57.550" style="s2">possibility and you may have to go a</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.480" end="01:17:59.830" style="s2">little black box for a while just to get</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.550" end="01:18:03.070" style="s2">your footing and it&#39;s okay we have the</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.830" end="01:18:05.530" style="s2">neural equipment to do that but in terms</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.070" end="01:18:07.090" style="s2">of blue chairs scientists eventually you</p>

<p begin="01:18:11.640" end="01:18:18.280" style="s2">they are already fighting AI right now</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.370" end="01:18:19.660" style="s2">they&#39;re demanding explainable AI well</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.280" end="01:18:21.670" style="s2">you need to explain your stuff in</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.660" end="01:18:23.800" style="s2">scientific terms but man these damn AI</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.670" end="01:18:25.600" style="s2">is right now they they find correlation</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.800" end="01:18:28.570" style="s2">of the weirdest stuff stuff that you</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.600" end="01:18:30.010" style="s2">would never have even seen as useful so</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.570" end="01:18:31.630" style="s2">they&#39;re still approaching this from a</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.010" end="01:18:32.860" style="s2">scientific methodology where you where</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.630" end="01:18:34.870" style="s2">you create this white paper that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.860" end="01:18:37.030" style="s2">defensible for all of time when in</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.870" end="01:18:39.340" style="s2">reality you just need the correlation</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.030" end="01:18:41.320" style="s2">for that moment in time you just need a</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.340" end="01:18:43.450" style="s2">correlation for that for that for those</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.320" end="01:18:45.010" style="s2">60 days and then you throw it aside and</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.450" end="01:18:46.660" style="s2">then a new correlation comes in and you</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.010" end="01:18:48.220" style="s2">need that for three days and you toss it</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.660" end="01:18:49.570" style="s2">aside and then a new correlation comes</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.220" end="01:18:51.430" style="s2">in you&#39;re not trying to find the</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.570" end="01:18:53.440" style="s2">fundamental axiom that you can then</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.430" end="01:18:55.420" style="s2">extrapolate not trying to find the plumb</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.440" end="01:18:57.850" style="s2">line and then defend it for all of time</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.420" end="01:18:59.800" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to find the stints the</p>

<p begin="01:18:59.800" end="01:19:04.720" style="s2">continue to move forward in an adaptive</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.900" end="01:19:09.070" style="s2">space where you have lost the monopoly</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.720" end="01:19:10.420" style="s2">on cognition and if they don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.070" end="01:19:12.460" style="s2">play that game and they dig their heels</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.420" end="01:19:17.010" style="s2">and I got 6,000 and of all brains</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.460" end="01:19:17.010" style="s2">they&#39;re coming so fuck you that&#39;s it</p>

<p begin="01:19:22.350" end="01:19:28.420" style="s2">there&#39;s another one passes near fuck</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.610" end="01:19:32.380" style="s2">brain cyclist that shit all day okay</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.420" end="01:19:34.930" style="s2">topi had a clarification question yeah</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.380" end="01:19:38.530" style="s2">sure so I was just wondering if I got</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.930" end="01:19:40.900" style="s2">essence right so pain of transformation</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.530" end="01:19:44.110" style="s2">has been weaponized by the humanistic</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.900" end="01:19:46.960" style="s2">hedonism for suppression and the cure is</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.110" end="01:19:49.480" style="s2">a no chemical process both because it is</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.960" end="01:19:53.350" style="s2">transformation and copper is the</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.480" end="01:19:54.880" style="s2">inhibiting factor in the fact that the</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.350" end="01:20:00.820" style="s2">blue church has no idea how to make</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.880" end="01:20:04.060" style="s2">sense about coming yeah sure yes so the</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.820" end="01:20:06.370" style="s2">copper as a symbol as a ley line for</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.060" end="01:20:07.960" style="s2">Venus the feminine energy being</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.370" end="01:20:10.350" style="s2">everywhere at all times and we are just</p>

<p begin="01:20:10.350" end="01:20:14.800" style="s2">that is a alchemical description that if</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.450" end="01:20:16.000" style="s2">you bring it to actual alchemists and</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.800" end="01:20:17.380" style="s2">people who study this stuff they&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.000" end="01:20:18.940" style="s2">like oh well I didn&#39;t think about it</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.380" end="01:20:20.890" style="s2">like that right so now it&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.940" end="01:20:22.480" style="s2">poof now they can work with that in</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.890" end="01:20:24.490" style="s2">their own logic in their own context</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.480" end="01:20:26.590" style="s2">that&#39;s a logic and context step by the</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.490" end="01:20:28.630" style="s2">way the blue church doesn&#39;t even can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.590" end="01:20:30.010" style="s2">even begin to penetrate or understand so</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.630" end="01:20:31.780" style="s2">these people will come up with solutions</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.010" end="01:20:33.550" style="s2">and I know this because in the Bronze</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.780" end="01:20:35.170" style="s2">Age people with identical ways of</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.550" end="01:20:37.960" style="s2">thinking still came up with solutions</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.170" end="01:20:40.060" style="s2">that worked I know this because history</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.960" end="01:20:41.560" style="s2">is a thing so I don&#39;t need to sit there</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.060" end="01:20:44.110" style="s2">and defend white papers all day it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.560" end="01:20:45.970" style="s2">stupid I know that it works I can hand</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.110" end="01:20:47.710" style="s2">us off to people who do think like this</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.970" end="01:20:49.870" style="s2">and they&#39;ll find solutions that will</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.710" end="01:20:52.330" style="s2">justify a reason meanwhile they actually</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.870" end="01:20:54.160" style="s2">get results so yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.330" end="01:20:59.170" style="s2">benefits of alchemy there to fight that</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.160" end="01:21:00.580" style="s2">blue line maximization okay this might</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.170" end="01:21:15.910" style="s2">be our last question</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.580" end="01:21:17.890" style="s2">key and bring us home yeah I&#39;m feeling a</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.910" end="01:21:22.090" style="s2">lot of nervousness so I&#39;m just taking a</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.890" end="01:21:26.410" style="s2">cue from Peter it&#39;s check-ins but the</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.090" end="01:21:31.680" style="s2">question the question is about into</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.410" end="01:21:39.310" style="s2">antimony of the the alchemy of that</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.680" end="01:21:41.280" style="s2">because you mentioned the you mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.310" end="01:21:44.920" style="s2">the word equilibrium and so I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.280" end="01:21:48.310" style="s2">trying to understand this the last</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.920" end="01:21:52.810" style="s2">couple slides of those symbols</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.310" end="01:21:55.930" style="s2">the e plus and minus and also saying</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.810" end="01:22:02.760" style="s2">it&#39;s really funny to see two plus two</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.930" end="01:22:07.180" style="s2">equals five yep that&#39;s my question I</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.760" end="01:22:09.940" style="s2">think I I think I I think I understand</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.180" end="01:22:11.620" style="s2">the alchemy so everyone here is</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.940" end="01:22:13.540" style="s2">currently confused by a lot of the</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.620" end="01:22:16.930" style="s2">alchemy stuff</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.540" end="01:22:17.430" style="s2">and that&#39;s my point that&#39;s exactly my</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.930" end="01:22:20.890" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.430" end="01:22:21.700" style="s2">you can&#39;t make sense of it you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.890" end="01:22:23.410" style="s2">figure it out</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.700" end="01:22:24.640" style="s2">you can&#39;t apply your logic and your</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.410" end="01:22:26.200" style="s2">science and your reason and your</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.640" end="01:22:28.180" style="s2">intellectual and your experiences and</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.200" end="01:22:30.670" style="s2">everything you&#39;ve been trained to do you</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.180" end="01:22:32.650" style="s2">can&#39;t figure it out so if I came up with</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.670" end="01:22:34.600" style="s2">attacks using that vector</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.650" end="01:22:35.910" style="s2">there ain&#39;t fuck all you can do about it</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.600" end="01:22:38.560" style="s2">cuz you don&#39;t even know where to start</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.910" end="01:22:41.260" style="s2">so the confusion you&#39;re having now yes</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.560" end="01:22:43.600" style="s2">that&#39;s the goal that&#39;s the purpose it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.260" end="01:22:45.580" style="s2">hiding the attack vector in absurdity</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.600" end="01:22:47.170" style="s2">and hiding it in things that you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.580" end="01:22:49.750" style="s2">trained to understand and train to</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.170" end="01:22:51.220" style="s2">dismiss so as a result I have free</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.750" end="01:22:54.460" style="s2">attack advantage while you&#39;re just like</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.220" end="01:22:56.920" style="s2">I don&#39;t get it so that&#39;s why I was stats</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.460" end="01:22:58.840" style="s2">is why I&#39;m selecting for alchemy in this</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.920" end="01:23:00.730" style="s2">example to show you that even from</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.840" end="01:23:02.940" style="s2">absurdity I can still attack the blue</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.730" end="01:23:02.940" style="s2">church</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.000" end="01:23:07.480" style="s2">but I think the question I mean like I</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.590" end="01:23:10.420" style="s2">just wanted to know a little bit of more</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.480" end="01:23:12.790" style="s2">about antimony but also it&#39;s reminding</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.420" end="01:23:17.860" style="s2">me about a series that I haven&#39;t read</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.790" end="01:23:20.530" style="s2">yet by Brandon Sanderson I think um do</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.860" end="01:23:23.320" style="s2">you have a familiarity with that I do</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.530" end="01:23:26.590" style="s2">not have regarding intima antimony it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.320" end="01:23:28.390" style="s2">um the antimony is it it is an</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.590" end="01:23:30.310" style="s2">interesting inversion of copper</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.390" end="01:23:32.650" style="s2">now how copper and Venus got bound</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.310" end="01:23:34.660" style="s2">together that was I think I was Roman</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.650" end="01:23:36.130" style="s2">Roman times you can look that one up I</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.660" end="01:23:38.350" style="s2">don&#39;t I don&#39;t have that one off the top</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.130" end="01:23:41.220" style="s2">of my head but I found it very</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.350" end="01:23:43.510" style="s2">interesting that that the inverse of</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.220" end="01:23:54.850" style="s2">Venus was actually the Great Wolf I</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.510" end="01:23:57.790" style="s2">found that to be like oh wow okay sorry</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.850" end="01:24:00.910" style="s2">I it&#39;s it&#39;s this is a hard one this is a</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.790" end="01:24:03.820" style="s2">hard talk no no the attack is hilarious</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.910" end="01:24:05.650" style="s2">and fun and now I get to really think</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.820" end="01:24:12.070" style="s2">through these things that&#39;s what&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.650" end="01:24:14.500" style="s2">so thank you oh cool so we&#39;ll end it</p>

<p begin="01:24:19.870" end="01:24:27.640" style="s2">see that there is no amount of</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.700" end="01:24:29.650" style="s2">creativity and skill that can be</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.640" end="01:24:32.020" style="s2">deployed to really really bring pain to</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.650" end="01:24:33.400" style="s2">the blue church for all the monstrous</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.020" end="01:24:36.370" style="s2">things they have been doing for the past</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.400" end="01:24:38.740" style="s2">hundred and fifty years I will use</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.370" end="01:24:41.020" style="s2">science we use not science how we use</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.740" end="01:24:43.570" style="s2">absurdity I will use clowns and cars</p>
