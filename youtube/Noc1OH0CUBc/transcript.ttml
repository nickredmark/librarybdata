<p begin="00:01:53.820" end="00:01:59.500" style="s2">because descartes gives us two competing</p>

<p begin="00:03:18.050" end="00:03:23.030" style="s2">Pascal talked about and we talked about</p>

<p begin="00:03:39.560" end="00:03:46.150" style="s2">ruin as we&#39;ve said instead what Pascal</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.930" end="00:03:48.680" style="s2">pointed out is that we have lost all</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.150" end="00:03:51.050" style="s2">these other ways of knowing that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.680" end="00:03:53.090" style="s2">so central to the axial revolution we</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.050" end="00:03:56.030" style="s2">all we have left is a spirit of geometry</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.090" end="00:03:57.560" style="s2">we have lost the spirit of finesse we</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.030" end="00:03:58.700" style="s2">have lost the procedural knowing the</p>

<p begin="00:04:08.600" end="00:04:13.670" style="s2">and of course Pascal himself had such a</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.180" end="00:04:15.740" style="s2">transformative experience and found the</p>

<p begin="00:06:57.659" end="00:07:05.060" style="s2">explore is why a secular solution for</p>

<p begin="00:07:26.159" end="00:07:31.680" style="s2">to argue that is to try and show the</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.370" end="00:07:35.699" style="s2">responses to the meaning crisis that</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.680" end="00:07:37.050" style="s2">come after Descartes and I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.699" end="00:07:41.639" style="s2">talk about them in terms of the pseudo</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.050" end="00:07:46.800" style="s2">religious ideologies and how we have</p>

<p begin="00:07:48.539" end="00:07:52.770" style="s2">socially because these ideologies have</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.949" end="00:07:54.959" style="s2">led to Titanic warfare and genocide all</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.770" end="00:07:59.219" style="s2">bloodshed and so we&#39;re trapped between</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.959" end="00:08:01.620" style="s2">we can&#39;t return to religion and we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.219" end="00:08:03.539" style="s2">move to its political secular</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.620" end="00:08:06.209" style="s2">alternatives because of the trauma that</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.539" end="00:08:09.509" style="s2">has been inflicted by their history and</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.209" end="00:08:11.370" style="s2">so we are stuck right there is no</p>

<p begin="00:08:11.370" end="00:08:19.110" style="s2">and yet we also are not willing to</p>

<p begin="00:08:19.110" end="00:08:29.550" style="s2">impotent religious framework so we sit</p>

<p begin="00:08:29.550" end="00:08:36.449" style="s2">we have to move rapidly and I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.260" end="00:08:38.699" style="s2">don&#39;t want to trespass on your time this</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.449" end="00:08:40.440" style="s2">video series is already long but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.699" end="00:08:45.029" style="s2">moving through Titanic figures here and</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.440" end="00:08:47.040" style="s2">it always is I feel a difficult thing to</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.029" end="00:08:49.470" style="s2">do but I well I want to talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.040" end="00:08:53.310" style="s2">figure of Conte and we&#39;ll talk about</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.470" end="00:08:55.519" style="s2">Conte in a couple places so I need to</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.310" end="00:08:59.639" style="s2">introduce them here anyways</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.519" end="00:09:02.610" style="s2">so Conte is trying to deal with this</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.639" end="00:09:08.339" style="s2">fracturing in realness that Descartes</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.610" end="00:09:10.949" style="s2">has left right and the the the the the</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.339" end="00:09:12.380" style="s2">two sides the inner subjective mind</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.949" end="00:09:19.620" style="s2">touching itself and the outer</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.380" end="00:09:23.130" style="s2">mathematical and caught brings up a</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.620" end="00:09:24.509" style="s2">question that is very important and</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.130" end="00:09:28.050" style="s2">there&#39;s been other people who have given</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.509" end="00:09:32.519" style="s2">voice to this and this is an important</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.050" end="00:09:34.940" style="s2">one which is how is it how is it that</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.519" end="00:09:38.040" style="s2">math is so good at describing reality</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.940" end="00:09:40.319" style="s2">why just accept Galileo&#39;s claim that</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.040" end="00:09:43.170" style="s2">it&#39;s the language of the universe we</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.319" end="00:09:45.899" style="s2">have we know long si at one point we had</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.170" end="00:09:48.329" style="s2">an answer to why math is so descriptive</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.899" end="00:09:51.180" style="s2">reality we had the Neoplatonic answer</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.329" end="00:09:53.670" style="s2">the idea that reality is ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.180" end="00:09:55.709" style="s2">grounded in intelligible form and those</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.670" end="00:09:57.120" style="s2">intelligible forms you remember the I</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.709" end="00:09:59.610" style="s2">das the structural functional</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.120" end="00:10:01.800" style="s2">organizations are ultimately abstract</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.610" end="00:10:04.199" style="s2">eternal etc and that&#39;s the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.800" end="00:10:07.350" style="s2">grounding that&#39;s why many people who are</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.199" end="00:10:09.600" style="s2">realists in mathematics formally and</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.350" end="00:10:11.699" style="s2">explicitly label themselves as platanus</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.600" end="00:10:14.639" style="s2">because that is a way of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.699" end="00:10:17.220" style="s2">explain how mathematics gives you access</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.639" end="00:10:20.329" style="s2">to reality when it is nothing like</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.220" end="00:10:23.190" style="s2">spatio-temporal material reality I mean</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.329" end="00:10:25.529" style="s2">why is it that something like math</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.190" end="00:10:28.139" style="s2">describes physics so well and and what</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.529" end="00:10:29.939" style="s2">Kant was really trying to get at is how</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.139" end="00:10:31.769" style="s2">do I get those two sides of Descartes</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.939" end="00:10:36.870" style="s2">together how do I get the side that says</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.769" end="00:10:38.880" style="s2">math is real but all I have math gives</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.870" end="00:10:42.870" style="s2">me access to reality but all I really</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.880" end="00:10:48.540" style="s2">have is access to my own mind how do I</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.870" end="00:10:53.639" style="s2">get those together and current comes up</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.540" end="00:10:55.920" style="s2">with a really radical proposal he calls</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.639" end="00:10:57.930" style="s2">it a Copernican revolution</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.920" end="00:11:00.480" style="s2">he thinks it&#39;s as important as</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.930" end="00:11:01.170" style="s2">Copernicus revolution of the external</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.480" end="00:11:05.620" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.170" end="00:11:08.949" style="s2">and the content proposal is a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.620" end="00:11:10.180" style="s2">very interesting one because what I</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.949" end="00:11:15.550" style="s2">think it does is is it really</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.180" end="00:11:18.250" style="s2">radicalizes things even more so Kant&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.550" end="00:11:21.069" style="s2">proposal is these categories these</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.250" end="00:11:23.190" style="s2">patterns of intelligibility we find in</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.069" end="00:11:28.420" style="s2">the world the mathematical properties</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.190" end="00:11:30.790" style="s2">aren&#39;t actually they&#39;re not in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.420" end="00:11:32.860" style="s2">we think they are so what caught does is</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.790" end="00:11:35.620" style="s2">he basically makes use of a move that</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.860" end="00:11:38.110" style="s2">akka made if you remember Occam&#39;s razor</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.620" end="00:11:40.060" style="s2">and remember I often say people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.110" end="00:11:43.209" style="s2">understand what they&#39;re invoking when</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.060" end="00:11:45.250" style="s2">they invoke Occam&#39;s razor Occam&#39;s razor</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.209" end="00:11:47.050" style="s2">basically says that all these patterns</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.250" end="00:11:51.190" style="s2">of intelligibility you think are in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.050" end="00:11:55.990" style="s2">world are actually in your mind right</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.190" end="00:11:59.350" style="s2">what what Kant does is says well these</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.990" end="00:12:02.470" style="s2">these ways of measuring the world</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.350" end="00:12:06.430" style="s2">mathematically they aren&#39;t the features</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.470" end="00:12:09.250" style="s2">of the world they are the way in which</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.430" end="00:12:12.040" style="s2">experience has to be organized in order</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.250" end="00:12:14.079" style="s2">to make sense to the mind so let me try</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.040" end="00:12:18.009" style="s2">and give you an analogy for</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.079" end="00:12:20.290" style="s2">understanding that right so I&#39;m gonna do</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.009" end="00:12:21.579" style="s2">a reverse on the analogy you see me use</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.290" end="00:12:23.860" style="s2">when we were talking about Siddhartha</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.579" end="00:12:25.180" style="s2">Gautama the Buddha right so let&#39;s do it</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.860" end="00:12:27.970" style="s2">the other way around the world is very</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.180" end="00:12:30.819" style="s2">blurry there&#39;s too much and so what I</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.970" end="00:12:33.370" style="s2">have to do is I have to filter it I have</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.819" end="00:12:36.790" style="s2">to filter it so that it will fit my eye</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.370" end="00:12:40.060" style="s2">and my brain and I can make sense of it</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.790" end="00:12:45.930" style="s2">so these filters have to be put into</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.060" end="00:12:48.639" style="s2">place and so Kant&#39;s idea was there are</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.930" end="00:12:52.630" style="s2">structures in the mind that basically</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.639" end="00:12:54.610" style="s2">act as these filtering frames it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.630" end="00:12:58.589" style="s2">of both a combination of a filter and a</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.610" end="00:13:02.829" style="s2">frame and what they do is they impose a</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.589" end="00:13:05.670" style="s2">structure of intelligibility on</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.829" end="00:13:05.670" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.060" end="00:13:12.380" style="s2">so this is opposite to the platonic this</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.520" end="00:13:14.360" style="s2">is why it&#39;s a Copernican revolution it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.380" end="00:13:28.760" style="s2">a complete reversal of the Platonic</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.360" end="00:13:31.160" style="s2">model so the idea is I&#39;m not discovering</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.760" end="00:13:32.930" style="s2">the patterns of intelligibility that</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.160" end="00:13:35.810" style="s2">structurally functionally organized the</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.930" end="00:13:39.200" style="s2">world what&#39;s actually happening is this</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.810" end="00:13:44.420" style="s2">right this pattern is being imposed on</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.200" end="00:13:47.300" style="s2">the information coming in so that it</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.420" end="00:13:55.760" style="s2">will fit my mind and make sense to my</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.300" end="00:13:57.770" style="s2">mind and that&#39;s the basis of my capacity</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.760" end="00:14:00.890" style="s2">for reasoning about the world I can</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.770" end="00:14:02.360" style="s2">reason about the world not because the</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.890" end="00:14:05.240" style="s2">world is ultimately rationally</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.360" end="00:14:09.140" style="s2">structured but like Arkham said the</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.240" end="00:14:11.810" style="s2">world is a absurd in itself I can reason</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.140" end="00:14:14.330" style="s2">about the world because I have filtered</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.810" end="00:14:16.790" style="s2">it in such a way that my mind can</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.330" end="00:14:21.140" style="s2">process it according to its own internal</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.790" end="00:14:22.970" style="s2">grammar so see how this is this is why</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.140" end="00:14:25.010" style="s2">it&#39;s a Copernican reversal I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.970" end="00:14:27.290" style="s2">discovering in the world the</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.010" end="00:14:29.450" style="s2">mathematical properties of things my</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.290" end="00:14:32.360" style="s2">mind is filtering and imposing a</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.450" end="00:14:34.010" style="s2">structure on them so that it can make</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.360" end="00:14:36.890" style="s2">sense and think about them so you have</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.010" end="00:14:38.990" style="s2">to take this word and this phrase and</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.890" end="00:14:45.980" style="s2">make it really really strong your mind</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.990" end="00:14:50.290" style="s2">is making sense of things and it&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.980" end="00:14:52.400" style="s2">whereas when we talk about relevance</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.290" end="00:14:56.390" style="s2">we&#39;re going to see that there&#39;s a deep</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.400" end="00:14:59.060" style="s2">sway in which con is I think right you</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.390" end="00:15:00.890" style="s2">say okay so yeah I see how he&#39;s he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.060" end="00:15:03.770" style="s2">sort of int completly inverting the</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.890" end="00:15:06.350" style="s2">world from Plato I get that right so</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.770" end="00:15:08.840" style="s2">math isn&#39;t discovering reality math is</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.350" end="00:15:11.210" style="s2">ultimately about how the mind imposes a</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.840" end="00:15:16.720" style="s2">structure on reality so it can reason</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.210" end="00:15:19.090" style="s2">about it great all right</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.720" end="00:15:21.130" style="s2">what does that mean well notice we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.090" end="00:15:24.160" style="s2">got now the my remember we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.130" end="00:15:26.830" style="s2">this model of the contact with the world</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.160" end="00:15:30.910" style="s2">being withdrawn and it&#39;s being withdrawn</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.830" end="00:15:33.640" style="s2">inside the mind by Luther and then it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:15:33.640" end="00:15:42.190" style="s2">not only is it withdrawn it&#39;s in prison</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.350" end="00:15:45.190" style="s2">the mind is in here and all they can get</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.190" end="00:15:49.060" style="s2">in here always has to pass through this</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.190" end="00:15:51.490" style="s2">filtering frame and for caught that</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.060" end="00:15:53.590" style="s2">means we can never know the world as it</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.490" end="00:15:58.150" style="s2">is in itself as he famously said the</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.590" end="00:16:03.640" style="s2">thing in itself we can never know the</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.150" end="00:16:05.170" style="s2">world as it is this is why of course the</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.640" end="00:16:08.110" style="s2">Cartesian search for a certainty is</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.170" end="00:16:09.940" style="s2">going to be completely undermined so</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.110" end="00:16:12.220" style="s2">ultimately notice how this is all coming</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.940" end="00:16:15.160" style="s2">together the mind is ultimately only</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.220" end="00:16:17.230" style="s2">really touching itself it has no contact</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.160" end="00:16:19.360" style="s2">now at the world it&#39;s not only withdrawn</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.230" end="00:16:24.490" style="s2">from the world it&#39;s isolated and trapped</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.360" end="00:16:26.530" style="s2">within itself but it does answer the</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.490" end="00:16:28.570" style="s2">question well why does mouth work so</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.530" end="00:16:31.540" style="s2">well well math works so well according</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.570" end="00:16:35.500" style="s2">to Kant because that&#39;s the grammar of</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.540" end="00:16:38.350" style="s2">how our minds operate that&#39;s why math</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.500" end="00:16:41.340" style="s2">which seems such a mental and abstract</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.350" end="00:16:43.690" style="s2">and weird thing seems to make the world</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.340" end="00:16:45.250" style="s2">succeeds that give us access to the</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.690" end="00:16:46.750" style="s2">structure of the world it&#39;s not really</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.250" end="00:16:49.930" style="s2">giving a structure to the access of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.750" end="00:16:53.170" style="s2">world it&#39;s creating a structure in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.930" end="00:16:59.339" style="s2">world of experience that is makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.170" end="00:17:02.470" style="s2">to human beings now that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.339" end="00:17:04.870" style="s2">that&#39;s a really big price to pay the</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.470" end="00:17:06.970" style="s2">price you pay for getting the two sides</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.870" end="00:17:09.880" style="s2">of Descartes back together is to get</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.970" end="00:17:12.160" style="s2">them both inside the mind and to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.880" end="00:17:14.800" style="s2">radically radically out of touch with</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.160" end="00:17:21.130" style="s2">the world now then so you can imagine</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.800" end="00:17:25.870" style="s2">that people are upset with this this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.130" end="00:17:27.280" style="s2">a very challenging idea there&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.870" end="00:17:29.320" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s going to be some really</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.280" end="00:17:29.640" style="s2">important responses to this they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.320" end="00:17:32.370" style="s2">going to</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.640" end="00:17:34.110" style="s2">the romantics and Hegel but I want to</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.370" end="00:17:35.540" style="s2">concentrate on the romantic solution</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.110" end="00:17:37.920" style="s2">because I&#39;ve already mentioned it and</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.540" end="00:17:45.180" style="s2">we&#39;ll talk a little bit about Hegel when</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.920" end="00:17:48.680" style="s2">we talk about Marx so there&#39;s an idea</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.180" end="00:17:54.210" style="s2">here right that&#39;s sort of implicit in</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.680" end="00:17:56.510" style="s2">Conte right there&#39;s an idea of right</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.210" end="00:17:59.850" style="s2">information coming in from the world</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.510" end="00:18:02.160" style="s2">right so in the problem with this</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.850" end="00:18:04.680" style="s2">diagram is it&#39;s too simplistic so think</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.160" end="00:18:07.170" style="s2">of the filter as having sort of levels</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.680" end="00:18:10.200" style="s2">of processing right there&#39;s the raw</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.170" end="00:18:12.570" style="s2">information from the thing in itself and</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.200" end="00:18:15.810" style="s2">it&#39;s getting processed it&#39;s coming in</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.570" end="00:18:19.290" style="s2">right and that right and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.810" end="00:18:21.480" style="s2">all of this structure being imposed on</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.290" end="00:18:24.600" style="s2">it now this by the way is the most</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.480" end="00:18:27.030" style="s2">prevalent model in most of cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.600" end="00:18:28.830" style="s2">psychology and cognitive science where</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.030" end="00:18:30.960" style="s2">you see this Contin</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.830" end="00:18:33.480" style="s2">grammar of trying to understand the mind</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.960" end="00:18:40.950" style="s2">is in current contrast between bottom-up</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.480" end="00:18:42.750" style="s2">processing versus top-down so the idea</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.950" end="00:18:43.830" style="s2">of bottom-up processing we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.750" end="00:18:47.610" style="s2">this when we talked about attention</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.830" end="00:18:49.260" style="s2">right is this is this is processing that</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.610" end="00:18:51.930" style="s2">starts in perception and moves towards</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.260" end="00:18:53.820" style="s2">cognition top-down is processing that</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.930" end="00:18:55.500" style="s2">starts in cognition starts from your</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.820" end="00:18:57.390" style="s2">knowledge and moves down into perception</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.500" end="00:18:59.900" style="s2">remember we talked about this when we</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.390" end="00:19:05.760" style="s2">talked about how you do how you do this</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.900" end="00:19:08.040" style="s2">right the cat right you see this is an H</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.760" end="00:19:10.050" style="s2">and this is an A and how do you do that</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.040" end="00:19:12.870" style="s2">well you use the knowledge of the word</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.050" end="00:19:14.430" style="s2">to disambiguate the letters and you use</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.870" end="00:19:16.110" style="s2">the knowledge of the letters to</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.430" end="00:19:18.480" style="s2">construct the word and the two are</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.110" end="00:19:20.010" style="s2">completely interpenetrating in a</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.480" end="00:19:22.350" style="s2">completely self-organizing manner</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.010" end="00:19:26.400" style="s2">outside of your cognitive awareness it</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.350" end="00:19:27.270" style="s2">actually makes your reading possible for</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.400" end="00:19:29.940" style="s2">you it&#39;s a conditioned on the</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.270" end="00:19:33.420" style="s2">possibility of you reading and so right</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.940" end="00:19:38.130" style="s2">this is the same model here the mind is</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.420" end="00:19:40.530" style="s2">imposing a structure and it&#39;s filtering</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.130" end="00:19:42.870" style="s2">and framing and structuring the</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.530" end="00:19:43.290" style="s2">information coming in from the world so</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.870" end="00:19:45.450" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.290" end="00:19:47.910" style="s2">tn model is pervasive through all of</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.450" end="00:19:50.550" style="s2">cognitive science and for a good reason</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.910" end="00:19:52.130" style="s2">it turns out to be a very very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.550" end="00:19:57.810" style="s2">way of looking at things</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.130" end="00:20:01.860" style="s2">but as I move this way as I move into</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.810" end="00:20:04.740" style="s2">the mind right because I get inside the</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.860" end="00:20:07.260" style="s2">framework my cognition of course becomes</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.740" end="00:20:10.500" style="s2">more and more rational becomes more and</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.260" end="00:20:13.800" style="s2">more mathematically logically</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.500" end="00:20:18.120" style="s2">intelligible but think about it notice</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.800" end="00:20:20.570" style="s2">you&#39;ve got is this weird idea now as my</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.120" end="00:20:23.100" style="s2">processing becomes more rational more</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.570" end="00:20:25.290" style="s2">logically mathematical I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.100" end="00:20:28.950" style="s2">getting farther and farther away from</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.290" end="00:20:31.680" style="s2">being in contact with the world now is</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.950" end="00:20:35.790" style="s2">not a seek notice the platonic aversion</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.680" end="00:20:37.350" style="s2">that the Platonic right reversion make a</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.790" end="00:20:39.960" style="s2">complete reversal of the Platonic</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.350" end="00:20:43.500" style="s2">structure is bringing with it a reverse</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.960" end="00:20:45.240" style="s2">consequence so for Plato as you pursue</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.500" end="00:20:50.040" style="s2">rationality you move deeper and deeper</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.240" end="00:20:52.290" style="s2">into reality but for current right</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.040" end="00:20:56.870" style="s2">notice as I move more and more</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.290" end="00:21:02.340" style="s2">interaction ality I&#39;m moving away from</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.870" end="00:21:05.850" style="s2">being in contact with reality now what</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.340" end="00:21:10.140" style="s2">comes to mind is well isn&#39;t the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.850" end="00:21:14.670" style="s2">then the case and think about how this</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.140" end="00:21:16.320" style="s2">is going to make Freud and Jung possible</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.670" end="00:21:19.770" style="s2">I mean you know how you get Carl Jung</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.320" end="00:21:23.820" style="s2">take part if you don&#39;t know can&#39;t stop</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.770" end="00:21:27.180" style="s2">talking about young because Jung</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.820" end="00:21:28.050" style="s2">repeatedly tells his readers I am a</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.180" end="00:21:30.780" style="s2">neo-kantian</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.050" end="00:21:33.150" style="s2">I&#39;m through and through a content he</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.780" end="00:21:35.700" style="s2">tells you that repeatedly and so if you</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.150" end="00:21:37.710" style="s2">don&#39;t know can&#39;t shut up about Jung</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.700" end="00:21:41.010" style="s2">because you&#39;re not understanding Jung</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.710" end="00:21:43.350" style="s2">properly the way you get Jung is you</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.010" end="00:21:45.900" style="s2">take car and you take Karnes</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.350" end="00:21:48.330" style="s2">epistemology and you addict to gnostic</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.900" end="00:21:51.260" style="s2">mythology and that&#39;s how you get that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.330" end="00:21:51.260" style="s2">the equation for Jung</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.450" end="00:21:57.829" style="s2">so why do I say this we&#39;ll think about</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.159" end="00:22:00.919" style="s2">this because if I go the other way if I</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.829" end="00:22:04.669" style="s2">open the mind up to these more</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.919" end="00:22:06.950" style="s2">irrational less fully processed parts of</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.669" end="00:22:09.229" style="s2">cognition the boundary between the</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.950" end="00:22:12.649" style="s2">conscious and the unconscious aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.229" end="00:22:16.399" style="s2">my experience as I move into the right</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.649" end="00:22:19.389" style="s2">the imaginary irrational dreamlike</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.399" end="00:22:21.829" style="s2">aspects of my cognition I&#39;m gonna lose</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.389" end="00:22:24.709" style="s2">rationality but notice what I&#39;m gaining</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.829" end="00:22:27.799" style="s2">I&#39;m gaining back that lost contact with</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.709" end="00:22:29.149" style="s2">the world lakshman talks about this in a</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.799" end="00:22:31.759" style="s2">really good book called the lost</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.149" end="00:22:35.209" style="s2">knowledge of the imagination right and</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.759" end="00:22:37.249" style="s2">so I think this is a misunderstanding</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.209" end="00:22:38.749" style="s2">but notice what&#39;s going on here and this</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.249" end="00:22:40.159" style="s2">is this is why my attitude towards the</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.749" end="00:22:42.109" style="s2">romantics is so ambivalent they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.159" end="00:22:44.469" style="s2">picking up on Pascal they&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.109" end="00:22:47.659" style="s2">recapture the lost perspective all</p>

<p begin="00:22:50.209" end="00:22:55.219" style="s2">because they&#39;re inside this content</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.519" end="00:22:59.989" style="s2">framework the way that&#39;s gonna happen is</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.219" end="00:23:02.419" style="s2">by moving into right the depths of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.989" end="00:23:04.339" style="s2">irrational aspects of the mind because</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.419" end="00:23:10.940" style="s2">those are the parts of the mind that are</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.339" end="00:23:12.019" style="s2">closer to reality and so of course what</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.940" end="00:23:13.700" style="s2">Jung and Freud are going to do is</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.019" end="00:23:15.649" style="s2">they&#39;re going to take that what the</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.700" end="00:23:18.349" style="s2">Romantics do about how to reach out into</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.649" end="00:23:19.639" style="s2">the world and they&#39;re gonna make it well</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.349" end="00:23:22.039" style="s2">at least for Freud is completely</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.639" end="00:23:23.749" style="s2">reaching down to the psyche for Jung</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.039" end="00:23:25.849" style="s2">it&#39;s reaching down into the psyche and</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.749" end="00:23:29.869" style="s2">back out into the world we&#39;ll come back</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.849" end="00:23:33.019" style="s2">to that later so this this is the main</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.869" end="00:23:35.059" style="s2">idea of Romanticism romanticism</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.019" end="00:23:38.419" style="s2">ultimately isn&#39;t about loving your</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.059" end="00:23:44.299" style="s2">sexual partner in a particular way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.419" end="00:23:47.359" style="s2">the idea that we can recapture contact</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.299" end="00:23:50.179" style="s2">with reality by moving away from the</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.359" end="00:23:52.369" style="s2">rational layers of cognition and into</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.179" end="00:23:55.849" style="s2">the irrational layers why does that get</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.369" end="00:23:57.529" style="s2">associated with love because remember in</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.849" end="00:24:00.619" style="s2">the neo platonic tradition with the</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.529" end="00:24:02.029" style="s2">romantics in this twisted way are trying</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.619" end="00:24:04.339" style="s2">to get back to they&#39;re trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.029" end="00:24:07.450" style="s2">back to gnosis and participatory knowing</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.339" end="00:24:11.000" style="s2">in a platonic tradition</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.450" end="00:24:15.230" style="s2">the quintessential form of participatory</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.000" end="00:24:20.030" style="s2">perspectival knowing is love the</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.230" end="00:24:26.270" style="s2">romantics have they get that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.030" end="00:24:29.630" style="s2">remembering that so we move into the</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.270" end="00:24:33.140" style="s2">irrational and will regain contact and</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.630" end="00:24:35.270" style="s2">of course that that relationship to the</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.140" end="00:24:37.310" style="s2">world where we&#39;re actually in touch with</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.270" end="00:24:39.200" style="s2">the other and there&#39;s mutual disclosure</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.310" end="00:24:42.950" style="s2">between myself and the other that&#39;s love</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.200" end="00:24:44.810" style="s2">and so the romantic return to reality</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.950" end="00:24:47.540" style="s2">through irrationality gets connected</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.810" end="00:24:50.120" style="s2">with love and that&#39;s how we get romantic</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.540" end="00:24:53.300" style="s2">love and we get the idea of it as a</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.120" end="00:24:56.570" style="s2">fundamentally irrational force right and</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.300" end="00:24:59.510" style="s2">you get romanticism and then you get the</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.570" end="00:25:02.930" style="s2">idea that well what is the Faculty that</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.510" end="00:25:05.860" style="s2">stands between perception and reason</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.930" end="00:25:08.390" style="s2">what&#39;s perception here</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.860" end="00:25:10.640" style="s2">the part where the thing in itself the</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.390" end="00:25:12.550" style="s2">world and here&#39;s reason up here what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.640" end="00:25:14.570" style="s2">the faculty in between that</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.550" end="00:25:17.240" style="s2">mathematically intelligible and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.570" end="00:25:24.410" style="s2">sensuously experienced right well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.240" end="00:25:29.380" style="s2">imagination imagination is where the</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.410" end="00:25:35.510" style="s2">mind initially imposes that order on the</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.380" end="00:25:37.280" style="s2">the raw data of experience see for us</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.510" end="00:25:39.230" style="s2">and the romantics were very critical of</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.280" end="00:25:41.150" style="s2">this and this is something that they</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.230" end="00:25:43.610" style="s2">were right about we understand the</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.150" end="00:25:47.090" style="s2">imagination just as moving mental images</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.610" end="00:25:48.680" style="s2">around in our head and the and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.090" end="00:25:51.320" style="s2">romantics made a big distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.680" end="00:25:54.770" style="s2">imagination and that faculty which they</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.320" end="00:25:59.720" style="s2">called fancy right or like phantasm</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.770" end="00:26:04.400" style="s2">right no no for them imagination right</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.720" end="00:26:06.830" style="s2">is how the mind imposes structure on raw</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.400" end="00:26:10.760" style="s2">data so that it becomes available to</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.830" end="00:26:14.470" style="s2">reason and so the imagination is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.760" end="00:26:17.780" style="s2">place in which we can get closer</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.470" end="00:26:19.530" style="s2">outside of reason to the access to</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.780" end="00:26:23.480" style="s2">reality so music</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.530" end="00:26:26.460" style="s2">and art are going to be understood as</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.480" end="00:26:28.760" style="s2">giving us access through the imagination</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.460" end="00:26:32.940" style="s2">to what&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.760" end="00:26:37.040" style="s2">why because music and art are where the</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.940" end="00:26:40.680" style="s2">mind seems to be imposing an order in</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.040" end="00:26:44.070" style="s2">such a way that meaning is made that we</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.680" end="00:26:46.620" style="s2">can then rationally reflect upon so</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.070" end="00:26:48.630" style="s2">you&#39;re getting you&#39;re getting two views</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.620" end="00:26:53.390" style="s2">now right that are coming into</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.630" end="00:26:56.220" style="s2">opposition one the older view</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.390" end="00:26:57.600" style="s2">represented by the Enlightenment I mean</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.220" end="00:26:59.520" style="s2">that in the scientific sense not the</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.600" end="00:27:03.030" style="s2">Buddhist enlightenment people like John</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.520" end="00:27:05.730" style="s2">Locke the mind is an empty canvas and</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.030" end="00:27:06.060" style="s2">sense experience comes in and writes on</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.730" end="00:27:10.140" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.060" end="00:27:12.510" style="s2">right that&#39;s empiricism so the mind is a</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.140" end="00:27:14.760" style="s2">blank slate the romantics have exactly</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.510" end="00:27:16.590" style="s2">the opposite view we don&#39;t actually ever</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.760" end="00:27:21.440" style="s2">know what the world is in and of itself</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.590" end="00:27:24.900" style="s2">the world is an empty canvas on which</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.440" end="00:27:28.140" style="s2">imagination expresses presses itself out</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.900" end="00:27:31.680" style="s2">is why expression is so important to the</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.140" end="00:27:35.370" style="s2">romantics to press yourself to press out</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.680" end="00:27:37.260" style="s2">the mind in imagination presses itself</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.370" end="00:27:39.060" style="s2">on to the world and of course that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.260" end="00:27:43.700" style="s2">where Jung and Freud are gonna get the</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.060" end="00:27:46.560" style="s2">notion of projecting onto the world from</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.700" end="00:27:48.060" style="s2">so you have these two connects why the</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.560" end="00:27:51.390" style="s2">romantics see themselves in deep</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.060" end="00:27:54.000" style="s2">competition with the empiricists who of</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.390" end="00:27:59.190" style="s2">course are part of what becomes known as</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.000" end="00:28:01.710" style="s2">the scientific model so what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.190" end="00:28:03.380" style="s2">here is these two views the mind is a</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.710" end="00:28:06.180" style="s2">blank slate upon which the world</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.380" end="00:28:08.820" style="s2">impresses itself Locke uses the term</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.180" end="00:28:11.340" style="s2">impressions the world impresses itself</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.820" end="00:28:13.950" style="s2">on your mind or the romantics no no the</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.340" end="00:28:16.860" style="s2">world is a blank canvas upon which the</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.950" end="00:28:20.010" style="s2">mind expresses itself and both are wrong</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.860" end="00:28:22.710" style="s2">I mean I I very rarely just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.010" end="00:28:24.810" style="s2">state things but I&#39;m really confident of</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.710" end="00:28:26.850" style="s2">this both of these models the mind of a</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.810" end="00:28:28.440" style="s2">blank slate is just overwhelmingly wrong</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.850" end="00:28:30.480" style="s2">way too much argument and evidence</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.440" end="00:28:32.880" style="s2">against it and this model of the world</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.480" end="00:28:35.430" style="s2">as a blank slate</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.880" end="00:28:39.870" style="s2">that we merely express herself on to is</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.430" end="00:28:44.520" style="s2">also wrong but what we get is we get</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.870" end="00:28:49.170" style="s2">this weird new thing everybody is swept</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.520" end="00:28:52.140" style="s2">up in Romanticism see romanticism is</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.170" end="00:28:54.990" style="s2">becomes a pan-european movement it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.140" end="00:28:56.310" style="s2">movement of the arts it&#39;s a movement in</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.990" end="00:28:58.500" style="s2">literature good too writes The Sorrows</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.310" end="00:29:01.680" style="s2">of Young Werther you have people like</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.500" end="00:29:06.330" style="s2">Beethoven bringing in write a romantic</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.680" end="00:29:09.210" style="s2">element to music right you have lots of</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.330" end="00:29:12.380" style="s2">romantic poetry you know think of Blake</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.210" end="00:29:14.790" style="s2">think of Wordsworth so you have this</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.380" end="00:29:18.000" style="s2">movement it gets taken up into religion</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.790" end="00:29:21.230" style="s2">by slur mocker as a way of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.000" end="00:29:31.350" style="s2">understand religion it&#39;s a pan-european</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.230" end="00:29:36.120" style="s2">movement alright and it does or it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.350" end="00:29:37.830" style="s2">hard to be fair to this but at least at</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.120" end="00:29:43.650" style="s2">least it appears to do what religion</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.830" end="00:29:45.990" style="s2">used to do it integrates music and art</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.650" end="00:29:48.600" style="s2">and literature and the project of trying</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.990" end="00:29:50.460" style="s2">to find and make meaning in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.600" end="00:29:53.660" style="s2">scientific worldview by giving you this</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.460" end="00:29:56.340" style="s2">whole framework of how you regain</p>

<p begin="00:30:10.230" end="00:30:14.780" style="s2">we&#39;ll talk about this later of religion</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.080" end="00:30:17.960" style="s2">and what it&#39;s going to do is</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.780" end="00:30:23.700" style="s2">irrationally take you into contact with</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.960" end="00:30:27.060" style="s2">reality so romanticism is the first and</p>

<p begin="00:36:33.200" end="00:36:41.420" style="s2">would the romantics be attracted to</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.450" end="00:36:43.280" style="s2">Napoleon you see we have to be careful</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.420" end="00:36:46.250" style="s2">here there&#39;s some very good podcast you</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.280" end="00:36:50.120" style="s2">can listen to comparing Napoleon to</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.250" end="00:36:51.200" style="s2">Hitler oh right that&#39;s your reaction</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.120" end="00:36:56.690" style="s2">soon as I mentioned the word Hitler</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.200" end="00:36:58.640" style="s2">that&#39;s fine but right why like of course</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.690" end="00:37:02.210" style="s2">Napoleon didn&#39;t engage in genocide but</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.640" end="00:37:06.800" style="s2">he drenches Europe and blood he launches</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.210" end="00:37:09.740" style="s2">imperial conquests there&#39;s lots of good</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.800" end="00:37:13.180" style="s2">historians would say maybe we only like</p>

<p begin="00:37:13.180" end="00:37:20.450" style="s2">but why do they like him look what</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.800" end="00:37:24.310" style="s2">Napoleon is doing by force of will and</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.450" end="00:37:26.920" style="s2">that&#39;s what the imagination is he is</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.310" end="00:37:29.620" style="s2">passing a structure on the world he is</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.920" end="00:37:35.440" style="s2">restructuring the world he is painting</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.620" end="00:37:40.330" style="s2">his picture onto the world here is the</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.440" end="00:37:45.250" style="s2">isolated self pressing itself out on the</p>

<p begin="00:37:49.980" end="00:37:55.080" style="s2">so of course Napoleon is defeated and</p>

<p begin="00:38:03.790" end="00:38:14.140" style="s2">happens is right there&#39;s a response to</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.620" end="00:38:16.270" style="s2">the failure of Romanticism it ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.140" end="00:38:18.070" style="s2">fails now here here&#39;s the thing that we</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.270" end="00:38:19.240" style="s2">have to understand romanticist and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.070" end="00:38:23.770" style="s2">tried to indicate this to you</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.240" end="00:38:26.560" style="s2">romanticism fails it fails to actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.770" end="00:38:29.530" style="s2">do what it wants it sets out to do it</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.560" end="00:38:37.330" style="s2">fails to be the replacement for</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.530" end="00:38:40.210" style="s2">Christianity and in that but it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.330" end="00:38:42.880" style="s2">go away so the way I put those two</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.210" end="00:38:45.160" style="s2">together the fact that it fails which I</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.880" end="00:38:47.320" style="s2">tried to show you but it doesn&#39;t go away</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.160" end="00:38:50.040" style="s2">which I tried to show you in the notion</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.320" end="00:38:52.780" style="s2">that we live with decadent Romanticism</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.040" end="00:38:55.230" style="s2">we live in decadent Romanticism and</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.780" end="00:38:58.870" style="s2">romantic comedies are the quintessential</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.230" end="00:39:06.330" style="s2">form of pornography in which we indulge</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.870" end="00:39:06.330" style="s2">in decadent Romanticism so</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.599" end="00:39:17.160" style="s2">what happens after the failure of this</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.819" end="00:39:20.059" style="s2">great pseudo religious ideology well</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.160" end="00:39:27.769" style="s2">there are further attempts to try and</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.059" end="00:39:30.630" style="s2">understand these romantic the irrational</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.769" end="00:39:34.259" style="s2">aspects of the psyche and its world</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.630" end="00:39:36.269" style="s2">making capacity and the way and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.259" end="00:39:40.500" style="s2">it&#39;s we still carrying this remember</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.269" end="00:39:48.410" style="s2">from Wacom and Aquinas the priority of</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.500" end="00:39:52.650" style="s2">the will the priority of the will so</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.410" end="00:39:56.849" style="s2">here romanticism very quickly passes</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.650" end="00:40:01.769" style="s2">into Schopenhauer who is the Godfather</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.849" end="00:40:03.269" style="s2">of nihilism and notice that a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.769" end="00:40:06.539" style="s2">these names are now going to be German</p>

<p begin="00:40:22.880" end="00:40:34.980" style="s2">what does Schopenhauer argue right well</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.279" end="00:40:37.440" style="s2">he completely internalizes that model of</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.980" end="00:40:43.049" style="s2">the world that we saw around the time of</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.440" end="00:40:47.339" style="s2">our command even in Luther he picks up</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.049" end="00:40:50.130" style="s2">on corn but he says right let&#39;s net note</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.339" end="00:40:53.009" style="s2">let&#39;s use an up-down model here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.130" end="00:40:54.269" style="s2">rational part remember and it&#39;s out of</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.009" end="00:40:56.809" style="s2">touch with reality and like the</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.269" end="00:41:00.240" style="s2">romantics here&#39;s the irrational part</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.809" end="00:41:02.549" style="s2">right and the romantics saw that this as</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.240" end="00:41:04.289" style="s2">imagination and they saw it sort of</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.549" end="00:41:06.630" style="s2">spontaneously happening but it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.289" end="00:41:09.710" style="s2">an act of will because they talk about</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.630" end="00:41:12.000" style="s2">expression pressing out right but</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.710" end="00:41:15.319" style="s2">Schopenhauer really zeroes in on this</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.000" end="00:41:18.180" style="s2">and he says no no what&#39;s down here is</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.319" end="00:41:20.610" style="s2">arbitrary we&#39;ll notice that that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.180" end="00:41:24.000" style="s2">God it&#39;s like that God</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.610" end="00:41:26.910" style="s2">that we get after akhom here&#39;s arbitrary</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.000" end="00:41:33.090" style="s2">will this is the this is the will to</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.910" end="00:41:36.210" style="s2">live the raw let&#39;s just put it the will</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.090" end="00:41:38.220" style="s2">to live the raw will this is what drives</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.210" end="00:41:42.330" style="s2">you this is what structures this is what</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.220" end="00:41:46.110" style="s2">filters in frame it&#39;s all of your</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.330" end="00:41:48.690" style="s2">experience this will to live of course</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.110" end="00:41:51.500" style="s2">this is gonna be important to a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.690" end="00:41:56.250" style="s2">modern discourse it&#39;s relentless and</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.500" end="00:42:00.810" style="s2">it&#39;s pointless because it is not</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.250" end="00:42:03.780" style="s2">rational and here&#39;s where Schopenhauer</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.810" end="00:42:06.120" style="s2">does a twist it&#39;s doing this but not</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.780" end="00:42:07.980" style="s2">fundamentally in service of your</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.120" end="00:42:12.780" style="s2">rational mind it makes reasoning</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.980" end="00:42:15.060" style="s2">possible but all of this right so Kant</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.780" end="00:42:17.310" style="s2">does the Copernican revolution he</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.060" end="00:42:18.840" style="s2">inverts Protestantism and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.310" end="00:42:20.880" style="s2">Schopenhauer inverts Caunt</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.840" end="00:42:23.760" style="s2">thought was it that this is processing</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.880" end="00:42:25.620" style="s2">is for the sake of this but what</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.760" end="00:42:27.390" style="s2">Schopenhauer says is no no this is</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.620" end="00:42:30.360" style="s2">actually who&#39;s in charge he says the</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.390" end="00:42:33.990" style="s2">will is like a huge man and the ego is</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.360" end="00:42:35.790" style="s2">sitting on his shoulders right this is a</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.990" end="00:42:37.680" style="s2">little machine in the service of this</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.790" end="00:42:39.120" style="s2">and if you don&#39;t think that&#39;s Carl Jung</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.680" end="00:42:40.980" style="s2">you&#39;d better go back and read some more</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.120" end="00:42:42.600" style="s2">Jung that&#39;s what I mean if you don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.980" end="00:42:47.810" style="s2">this Conti and heritage you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.600" end="00:42:47.810" style="s2">reading Jung very well right so</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.380" end="00:42:51.750" style="s2">Schopenhauer let&#39;s use one of</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.070" end="00:42:53.700" style="s2">Schopenhauer&#39;s quotes because it really</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.750" end="00:42:56.070" style="s2">really brings this out and you can see</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.700" end="00:42:58.830" style="s2">how it prefigures Freud in such a</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.070" end="00:43:02.940" style="s2">powerful way Schopenhauer says that sex</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.830" end="00:43:07.110" style="s2">is the cruel joke that the species plays</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.940" end="00:43:09.570" style="s2">on the individual because what sex is is</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.110" end="00:43:11.760" style="s2">this will to live this irrational will</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.570" end="00:43:13.950" style="s2">to live and it filters and frames all of</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.760" end="00:43:16.710" style="s2">your experience and it promises you</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.950" end="00:43:19.230" style="s2">meaning and you know fulfillment in</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.710" end="00:43:21.180" style="s2">everything that God and religion and</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.230" end="00:43:28.230" style="s2">history profit and then you have it and</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.180" end="00:43:29.490" style="s2">none of that accrues to you any and he</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.230" end="00:43:31.890" style="s2">says and then what&#39;s the difference</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.490" end="00:43:35.780" style="s2">between you who do that for 40 years and</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.890" end="00:43:35.780" style="s2">a mayfly that does it for one</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.480" end="00:43:46.200" style="s2">so we&#39;re restlessly driven by these Iraq</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.309" end="00:43:48.119" style="s2">look at look at how again everything&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.200" end="00:43:50.460" style="s2">being drawn into the mind and now drawn</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.119" end="00:43:52.619" style="s2">into the unconscious irrational parts of</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.460" end="00:43:54.270" style="s2">this is where that arbitrary God has now</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.619" end="00:43:56.910" style="s2">withdrawn you know in that Lutheran</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.270" end="00:43:59.250" style="s2">Cartesian now Kantian now Schopenhauer</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.910" end="00:44:02.970" style="s2">away it&#39;s inside and then and we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.250" end="00:44:07.050" style="s2">all machines and you get Richard Dawkins</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.970" end="00:44:09.960" style="s2">right we&#39;re all just replicator machines</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.050" end="00:44:14.510" style="s2">for our selfish genes it&#39;s not a radical</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.960" end="00:44:14.510" style="s2">idea right</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.040" end="00:44:21.140" style="s2">we think we&#39;re doing all of this for AI</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.650" end="00:44:23.270" style="s2">but it&#39;s actually all and so for</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.140" end="00:44:29.090" style="s2">Schopenhauer is it&#39;s this nihilism it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.270" end="00:44:33.190" style="s2">this pessimism because he saw that once</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.090" end="00:44:35.840" style="s2">you remove the connection between</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.190" end="00:44:40.210" style="s2">meaning-making and rationality you pay a</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.840" end="00:44:43.160" style="s2">very very devastating price for it and</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.210" end="00:44:48.560" style="s2">so what do you have there well what do</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.160" end="00:44:53.570" style="s2">you have you have a meaningless</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.560" end="00:44:56.180" style="s2">existence because it&#39;s being shaped and</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.570" end="00:44:59.290" style="s2">framed not in contact with reality all</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.180" end="00:45:02.890" style="s2">not even contact with your rational</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.290" end="00:45:06.890" style="s2">egocentric wave it&#39;s just an irrational</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.890" end="00:45:10.250" style="s2">unconscious arbitrary will to live that</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.890" end="00:45:12.770" style="s2">is shaping filtering and framing all of</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.250" end="00:45:18.550" style="s2">your experience with the world and then</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.770" end="00:45:20.690" style="s2">you die and what was it all for</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.550" end="00:45:22.820" style="s2">Schopenhauer ax has enough of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.690" end="00:45:26.770" style="s2">romantics left in him that he has this</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.820" end="00:45:29.600" style="s2">idea that in art and music we can become</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.770" end="00:45:33.140" style="s2">disinterested enough in our own self we</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.600" end="00:45:36.560" style="s2">can quiet the will to live enough that</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.140" end="00:45:39.080" style="s2">we can get momentary breaks momentary</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.560" end="00:45:47.000" style="s2">vacation momentary respite from this</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.080" end="00:45:50.500" style="s2">Restless pointless will to live so this</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.000" end="00:45:53.060" style="s2">is how this is the godfather this is how</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.500" end="00:45:56.750" style="s2">romanticism as a pseudo religious</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.060" end="00:46:01.400" style="s2">ideology and nihilism as an existential</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.750" end="00:46:03.200" style="s2">response become inextricably linked</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.400" end="00:46:05.780" style="s2">together even though most people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.200" end="00:46:09.260" style="s2">realize it most people don&#39;t realize</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.780" end="00:46:11.330" style="s2">that that these two things romanticism</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.260" end="00:46:13.970" style="s2">and nihilism are actually deeply</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.330" end="00:46:15.620" style="s2">intertwined and closely related to each</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.970" end="00:46:18.160" style="s2">other so think about that when</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.620" end="00:46:23.150" style="s2">Valentine&#39;s Day rolls around</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.160" end="00:46:25.670" style="s2">are you actually expressing right the</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.150" end="00:46:28.559" style="s2">contact with reality or are you merely</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.670" end="00:46:42.209" style="s2">being pushed around by the irrational</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.559" end="00:46:49.559" style="s2">will to live so Schopenhauer of course</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.209" end="00:46:52.469" style="s2">has a great follower right a person who</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.559" end="00:46:55.640" style="s2">is now very prominent because if he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.469" end="00:46:57.479" style="s2">the Godfather right of nihilism</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.640" end="00:46:59.900" style="s2">Nietzsche is the Godfather of</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.479" end="00:46:59.900" style="s2">post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.059" end="00:47:11.819" style="s2">so Nietzsche is a disciple of</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.229" end="00:47:14.880" style="s2">Schopenhauer he&#39;s actually a disciple of</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.819" end="00:47:18.419" style="s2">both Schopenhauer and Wagner and Wagner</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.880" end="00:47:23.400" style="s2">represents romanticism in music breaking</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.419" end="00:47:25.919" style="s2">down so vogner takes romanticism and he</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.400" end="00:47:27.900" style="s2">sort of breaks the last vestiges of</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.919" end="00:47:30.299" style="s2">grammar he breaks the connection to the</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.900" end="00:47:32.159" style="s2">HOME key all kinds of things he opens up</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.299" end="00:47:33.989" style="s2">the possibility for music becoming</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.159" end="00:47:35.609" style="s2">untethered from its tradition in very</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.989" end="00:47:37.409" style="s2">powerful ways and of course the problem</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.609" end="00:47:41.939" style="s2">with Wagner is he&#39;s also a very vicious</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.409" end="00:47:43.709" style="s2">anti-semite and you might say what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.939" end="00:47:44.909" style="s2">going on like what&#39;s what&#39;s just going</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.709" end="00:47:47.209" style="s2">on with Germany in this anti-semitism</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.909" end="00:47:49.679" style="s2">thing well first of all we&#39;ve seen how</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.209" end="00:47:51.809" style="s2">Gnosticism which is running as an</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.679" end="00:47:53.609" style="s2">undercurrent as I mentioned right</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.809" end="00:47:57.269" style="s2">underneath the Rhineland mystics and</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.609" end="00:47:59.369" style="s2">other things right has I possible I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.269" end="00:48:02.729" style="s2">not equated the two but Gnosticism has a</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.369" end="00:48:11.239" style="s2">possible version of it that is deeply</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.729" end="00:48:17.119" style="s2">anti-semitic but more importantly right</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.239" end="00:48:17.119" style="s2">you have a connection back to Luther</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.769" end="00:48:28.679" style="s2">why would Luther say that well Luther</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.640" end="00:48:30.719" style="s2">would say that because the Jews in</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.679" end="00:48:35.099" style="s2">Luther&#39;s mind are followers of the law</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.719" end="00:48:36.779" style="s2">and people and remember Luther has an</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.099" end="00:48:39.749" style="s2">interpretation following Augustine and</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.779" end="00:48:42.989" style="s2">Paul and his own exacerbation of it</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.749" end="00:48:44.640" style="s2">right people who follow the law are</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.989" end="00:48:47.489" style="s2">people who are trying to earn their</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.640" end="00:48:49.259" style="s2">salvation the point of the law is to</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.489" end="00:48:52.169" style="s2">reveal to you that you&#39;re completely</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.259" end="00:48:56.219" style="s2">incapable of earning your salvation and</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.169" end="00:48:58.679" style="s2">so the Jews who reject Jesus reject</p>

<p begin="00:51:49.900" end="00:51:53.890" style="s2">self-transcendence because Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.970" end="00:51:56.710" style="s2">tries to understand the will to power as</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.890" end="00:51:59.170" style="s2">exactly that desire from the actual</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.710" end="00:52:03.610" style="s2">revolution to transcend oneself to go</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.170" end="00:52:07.360" style="s2">above oneself to create beyond oneself</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.610" end="00:52:11.620" style="s2">and he had his father&#39;s a Lutheran</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.360" end="00:52:13.780" style="s2">pastor mm-hmm so he understands</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.620" end="00:52:17.520" style="s2">Christianity in a totally Lutheran way</p>

<p begin="00:52:20.050" end="00:52:25.950" style="s2">it&#39;s an unfair reading of Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.410" end="00:52:30.910" style="s2">it certainly doesn&#39;t capture Neoplatonic</p>

<p begin="00:52:30.910" end="00:52:34.570" style="s2">influenced by the Stoics and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.530" end="00:52:36.370" style="s2">axial age thinkers and he&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.570" end="00:52:42.330" style="s2">bring it back but he&#39;s right he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.370" end="00:52:45.960" style="s2">blocked in some important ways by this</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.330" end="00:52:50.110" style="s2">Lutheran interpretation of Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.960" end="00:52:52.630" style="s2">so Nietzsche says Christianity repressed</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.110" end="00:52:56.260" style="s2">this and that is why we suffer but if we</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.630" end="00:53:00.160" style="s2">remove the Christian condemnation of</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.260" end="00:53:03.520" style="s2">this then the pessimistic world wearying</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.160" end="00:53:05.560" style="s2">will to live becomes the active creative</p>

<p begin="00:53:05.560" end="00:53:14.370" style="s2">back the meaning that was lost in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.710" end="00:53:14.370" style="s2">meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.500" end="00:53:35.620" style="s2">but that&#39;s a very dangerous way to start</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.810" end="00:53:38.440" style="s2">thinking and a lot of ways because</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.620" end="00:53:41.680" style="s2">here&#39;s my deepest critique of nature and</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.440" end="00:53:42.640" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s really hard to critique</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.680" end="00:53:46.270" style="s2">Nietzsche because he doesn&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.640" end="00:53:48.100" style="s2">single voice he has many voices and they</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.270" end="00:53:50.380" style="s2">and they undermine and criticize each</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.100" end="00:53:51.790" style="s2">other it&#39;s maddening and that&#39;s why if</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.380" end="00:53:52.840" style="s2">anybody says they have sort of singled</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.790" end="00:53:54.700" style="s2">interpretation of nature you have to</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.840" end="00:53:56.230" style="s2">really be careful and cautious about it</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.700" end="00:53:58.930" style="s2">because reading needs like reading the</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.230" end="00:54:01.000" style="s2">Bible purposefully he purposely modeled</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.930" end="00:54:03.430" style="s2">himself he wrote also sprach zarathustra</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.000" end="00:54:06.130" style="s2">to try and replace the bible because he</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.430" end="00:54:08.410" style="s2">understood the role of myth and imagery</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.130" end="00:54:10.330" style="s2">and symbol because he&#39;s still influenced</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.410" end="00:54:12.580" style="s2">by the romantics but here&#39;s my criticism</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.330" end="00:54:16.510" style="s2">see Nietzsche gets this he understands</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.580" end="00:54:18.280" style="s2">how self-deceptive we are he constantly</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.510" end="00:54:21.160" style="s2">is criticizing human beings for being</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.280" end="00:54:22.290" style="s2">self deceptive but he he can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.160" end="00:54:24.820" style="s2">anything about it</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.290" end="00:54:27.790" style="s2">he can&#39;t do anything about it because he</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.820" end="00:54:29.740" style="s2">is reduced in his mind reason has gone</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.790" end="00:54:32.140" style="s2">through this content thing and this</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.740" end="00:54:36.640" style="s2">Cartesian thing and reason is this</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.140" end="00:54:39.370" style="s2">logical framing thing he&#39;s lost</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.640" end="00:54:41.560" style="s2">something because the problem for</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.370" end="00:54:43.630" style="s2">Nietzsche is you have self transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.560" end="00:54:45.850" style="s2">without the machinery of dealing with</p>
