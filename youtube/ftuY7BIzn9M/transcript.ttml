<p begin="00:00:03.199" end="00:00:07.440" style="s2">hi john thank you so much for making</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.200" end="00:00:08.720" style="s2">time for this conversation i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.440" end="00:00:12.000" style="s2">really looking forward to it because</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.720" end="00:00:14.559" style="s2">i&#39;ve uh feel like i quite frequently</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.000" end="00:00:15.040" style="s2">quote one particular sentence of yours</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.559" end="00:00:17.600" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.040" end="00:00:19.279" style="s2">and it&#39;d be wonderful to have uh that</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.600" end="00:00:22.320" style="s2">explained a little deeper by you</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.279" end="00:00:23.840" style="s2">um but i&#39;ll get to that later so thank</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.320" end="00:00:25.279" style="s2">you so much for making time and</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.840" end="00:00:27.119" style="s2">normally i start these conversations</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.279" end="00:00:30.000" style="s2">with giving my my guest or my</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.119" end="00:00:31.279" style="s2">conversation partner an opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.000" end="00:00:33.520" style="s2">tell a little bit about themselves</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.279" end="00:00:37.040" style="s2">rather than me reading out a bio</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.520" end="00:00:38.480" style="s2">um so you&#39;re one of</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.040" end="00:00:40.800" style="s2">to my mind one of the leading</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.480" end="00:00:43.280" style="s2">researchers in evolution and</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.800" end="00:00:44.879" style="s2">complexity and i particularly like that</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.280" end="00:00:48.800" style="s2">you come in from a complexity</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.879" end="00:00:51.520" style="s2">angle to the study of evolution and so</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.800" end="00:00:53.840" style="s2">yeah please introduce yourself and how</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.520" end="00:00:57.199" style="s2">do you get into this</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.840" end="00:00:57.199" style="s2">yeah well it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.280" end="00:01:00.640" style="s2">not a direct path that brought me here</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.000" end="00:01:03.039" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.640" end="00:01:04.320" style="s2">and i don&#39;t know really what just where</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.039" end="00:01:05.760" style="s2">to start but</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.320" end="00:01:07.600" style="s2">probably the most significant event in</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.760" end="00:01:12.000" style="s2">my life was when i</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.600" end="00:01:14.080" style="s2">uh in grade 11 in school i did a there</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.000" end="00:01:17.520" style="s2">was a new physics course</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.080" end="00:01:19.360" style="s2">that emphasized problem solving uh an</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.520" end="00:01:22.640" style="s2">open book approach and so on so</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.360" end="00:01:24.320" style="s2">it emphasized uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.640" end="00:01:26.960" style="s2">not right learning but bringing your</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.320" end="00:01:30.400" style="s2">intelligence to physical issues</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.960" end="00:01:31.200" style="s2">um and i i got 12 out of 20 in the first</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.400" end="00:01:33.040" style="s2">test</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.200" end="00:01:34.720" style="s2">and i&#39;d never done so badly in science</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.040" end="00:01:35.759" style="s2">before and it sort of completely rocked</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.720" end="00:01:37.680" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.759" end="00:01:39.119" style="s2">um but i&#39;ve been reading a book called</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.680" end="00:01:42.159" style="s2">psycho cybernetics</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.119" end="00:01:45.600" style="s2">which was a book about</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.159" end="00:01:47.920" style="s2">the russian work on cybernetics</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.600" end="00:01:49.840" style="s2">and the russians you know that was in</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.920" end="00:01:52.159" style="s2">the 60s the russians were</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.840" end="00:01:54.320" style="s2">extraordinarily advanced and i read</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.159" end="00:01:57.280" style="s2">about algorithms for the first time</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.320" end="00:01:58.799" style="s2">so the 1960s you could go a long way</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.280" end="00:02:01.840" style="s2">through a library and never encountered</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.799" end="00:02:03.759" style="s2">the word algorithm unlike today</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.840" end="00:02:05.040" style="s2">and i heard that they were teaching</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.759" end="00:02:07.040" style="s2">people algorithms</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.040" end="00:02:09.200" style="s2">school students algorithms for problem</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.040" end="00:02:11.200" style="s2">solving and they were doing far better</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.200" end="00:02:15.840" style="s2">on problem solving tests so i thought</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.200" end="00:02:19.200" style="s2">aha i&#39;ve got to work out the algorithms</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.840" end="00:02:20.239" style="s2">that can be used to solve these physics</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.200" end="00:02:22.080" style="s2">problems</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.239" end="00:02:24.800" style="s2">and i went went and interviewed the the</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.080" end="00:02:28.319" style="s2">kids who did really well in class and um</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.800" end="00:02:30.480" style="s2">and i i extracted their their algorithms</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.319" end="00:02:31.920" style="s2">and then i examined my own thinking so i</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.480" end="00:02:34.480" style="s2">turned attention inwards</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.920" end="00:02:36.160" style="s2">to my own thinking compared it with</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.480" end="00:02:38.800" style="s2">ideal algorithms</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.160" end="00:02:39.680" style="s2">corrected my implicit algorithms and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.800" end="00:02:42.800" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.680" end="00:02:44.560" style="s2">and after that the all sciences at</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.800" end="00:02:47.440" style="s2">school were easy</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.560" end="00:02:48.560" style="s2">um if it was like locking the unlocking</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.440" end="00:02:52.319" style="s2">the door</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.560" end="00:02:54.080" style="s2">to um uh intellectual understanding and</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.319" end="00:02:57.519" style="s2">so on in science</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.080" end="00:02:58.800" style="s2">um so that that was a major event in my</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.519" end="00:03:01.640" style="s2">life and and</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.800" end="00:03:04.200" style="s2">so that led to a long history of</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.640" end="00:03:08.319" style="s2">self-examination self-correction</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.200" end="00:03:12.159" style="s2">self-mastery uh remaking oneself</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.319" end="00:03:15.040" style="s2">um and i remade myself to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.159" end="00:03:18.400" style="s2">more and more intellectual um so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.040" end="00:03:20.000" style="s2">like the singularity where the ai</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.400" end="00:03:21.760" style="s2">is so intelligent it can make a more</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.000" end="00:03:23.920" style="s2">intelligent version of itself</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.760" end="00:03:25.360" style="s2">and so on and bootstraps itself up into</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.920" end="00:03:27.200" style="s2">the singularity</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.360" end="00:03:28.959" style="s2">individuals can actually do that in my</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.200" end="00:03:31.280" style="s2">experience so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.959" end="00:03:32.480" style="s2">but my other great passion was fishing</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.280" end="00:03:36.159" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.480" end="00:03:37.760" style="s2">uh i went to university doing uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.159" end="00:03:39.200" style="s2">to become a marine biologist because i</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.760" end="00:03:42.480" style="s2">could go fishing all the time</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.200" end="00:03:46.159" style="s2">how logical is that you know and um</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.480" end="00:03:47.040" style="s2">then i uh and then halfway through uni i</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.159" end="00:03:49.599" style="s2">thought</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.040" end="00:03:51.440" style="s2">god the barrier reefs you know just 500</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.599" end="00:03:53.360" style="s2">miles north of here</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.440" end="00:03:54.879" style="s2">i&#39;m silly sitting in lectures you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.360" end="00:03:58.480" style="s2">for nine months of the year i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.879" end="00:03:58.959" style="s2">i&#39;ll go uh so i went i went fishing and</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.480" end="00:04:00.480" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.959" end="00:04:02.480" style="s2">soon earned enough money to buy my own</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.480" end="00:04:04.560" style="s2">fishing boat and i was</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.480" end="00:04:05.840" style="s2">mackerel fishing which is line fishing</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.560" end="00:04:06.640" style="s2">it&#39;s an extraordinary way to make a</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.840" end="00:04:08.000" style="s2">living</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.640" end="00:04:09.680" style="s2">if you love fishing because you actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.000" end="00:04:12.480" style="s2">catch them one by one</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.680" end="00:04:12.879" style="s2">trolling around the reefs the reefs of</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.480" end="00:04:16.079" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.879" end="00:04:16.479" style="s2">great barrier reef um but when the wind</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.079" end="00:04:18.479" style="s2">blew</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.479" end="00:04:20.560" style="s2">i used to you can&#39;t take your boat out</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.479" end="00:04:22.160" style="s2">so i&#39;d go to the library the library in</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.560" end="00:04:24.479" style="s2">cairns</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.160" end="00:04:26.560" style="s2">and i started reading the books at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.479" end="00:04:28.560" style="s2">beginning of the dewey system double o</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.560" end="00:04:30.880" style="s2">double oh one or whatever they are</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.560" end="00:04:32.560" style="s2">and they&#39;re all the philosophy books so</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.880" end="00:04:34.000" style="s2">at 18</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.560" end="00:04:37.360" style="s2">when the wind blew and i couldn&#39;t took</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.000" end="00:04:37.360" style="s2">my take my boat out i</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.440" end="00:04:42.080" style="s2">was reading philosophy and i fell in</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.199" end="00:04:44.160" style="s2">love with it and i knew then that</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.080" end="00:04:45.360" style="s2">the life i&#39;d foreseen which was having a</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.160" end="00:04:47.759" style="s2">boat</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.360" end="00:04:49.120" style="s2">rambling around the pacific around the</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.759" end="00:04:50.639" style="s2">islands and so on</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.120" end="00:04:53.040" style="s2">that wasn&#39;t going to be my life it was</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.639" end="00:04:56.720" style="s2">going to be an intellectual life</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.040" end="00:04:58.960" style="s2">a philosopher&#39;s life and soon after as i</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.720" end="00:05:01.520" style="s2">read about evolution i realized that</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.960" end="00:05:04.000" style="s2">i came to this intuition that a</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.520" end="00:05:06.240" style="s2">comprehensive theory of evolution</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.000" end="00:05:07.440" style="s2">must cover everything must cover all</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.240" end="00:05:09.440" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.440" end="00:05:10.720" style="s2">must cover not just biology but you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.440" end="00:05:11.919" style="s2">everything that preceded it and</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.720" end="00:05:14.400" style="s2">everything after it</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.919" end="00:05:17.360" style="s2">including you know comprehensive theory</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.400" end="00:05:20.080" style="s2">of evolution must deal with politics</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.360" end="00:05:21.759" style="s2">it must deal with global warming which</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.080" end="00:05:24.720" style="s2">was an issue at the time but hardly</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.759" end="00:05:26.479" style="s2">what it is now and how you organize</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.720" end="00:05:27.759" style="s2">society to deal with issues like global</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.479" end="00:05:31.759" style="s2">warming so</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.759" end="00:05:35.199" style="s2">so that led me into evolution and uh the</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.759" end="00:05:36.880" style="s2">but the</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.199" end="00:05:38.639" style="s2">this is still early in my life but i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.880" end="00:05:41.120" style="s2">just i&#39;m not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.639" end="00:05:42.400" style="s2">it i won&#39;t go for every year like this</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.120" end="00:05:45.520" style="s2">don&#39;t worry but</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.400" end="00:05:47.520" style="s2">but the um uh but i</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.520" end="00:05:49.360" style="s2">graduated went back to uni graduated got</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.520" end="00:05:52.720" style="s2">my bachelor of science degree</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.360" end="00:05:54.400" style="s2">and then i saw that in evolution science</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.720" end="00:05:55.440" style="s2">which now i was in love with it was my</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.400" end="00:05:57.120" style="s2">passion</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.440" end="00:05:58.880" style="s2">in evolution science there was no room</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.120" end="00:06:00.479" style="s2">for intellectuality</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.880" end="00:06:02.560" style="s2">very little room for intelligence no</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.479" end="00:06:03.520" style="s2">room for creativity no big picture</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.560" end="00:06:06.319" style="s2">thinking</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.520" end="00:06:08.319" style="s2">it was narrow what i would now call</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.319" end="00:06:09.440" style="s2">analytical rational thinking mechanistic</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.319" end="00:06:12.319" style="s2">thinking</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.440" end="00:06:13.039" style="s2">um thinking that can only understand</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.319" end="00:06:16.000" style="s2">those</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.039" end="00:06:16.479" style="s2">those limited phenomena in the world</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.000" end="00:06:18.000" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.479" end="00:06:20.560" style="s2">which happen to be able to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.000" end="00:06:22.319" style="s2">approximated by mechanical models</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.560" end="00:06:23.759" style="s2">when the great part of reality is far</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.319" end="00:06:25.440" style="s2">too complex to be understood by</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.759" end="00:06:26.880" style="s2">mechanical models that would have been</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.440" end="00:06:29.039" style="s2">roughly around the time of</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.880" end="00:06:31.840" style="s2">the selfish gene and richard dawkins</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.039" end="00:06:35.840" style="s2">taking evolutionary signs onto a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.840" end="00:06:37.360" style="s2">genetic reductionism that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.840" end="00:06:39.280" style="s2">well the turning point as i didn&#39;t learn</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.360" end="00:06:42.960" style="s2">until many years later was that in</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.280" end="00:06:44.560" style="s2">the early 40s um</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.960" end="00:06:46.479" style="s2">the great evolutionary scientists of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.560" end="00:06:48.160" style="s2">time actually had a meeting</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.479" end="00:06:50.160" style="s2">and a series of meetings and they</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.160" end="00:06:52.880" style="s2">decided that to become</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.160" end="00:06:54.080" style="s2">a professional academic discipline they</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.880" end="00:06:56.720" style="s2">had to narrow down</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.080" end="00:06:58.319" style="s2">evolution evolutionary science to</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.720" end="00:07:00.800" style="s2">mathematical models</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.319" end="00:07:02.960" style="s2">the mechanical models uh and they</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.800" end="00:07:06.479" style="s2">decided to use their</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.960" end="00:07:08.800" style="s2">editor editorship of the key journals of</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.479" end="00:07:10.880" style="s2">evolutionary journals of the era to</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.800" end="00:07:12.720" style="s2">banish big picture thinking</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.880" end="00:07:14.319" style="s2">even though most of these guys were big</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.720" end="00:07:17.919" style="s2">picture thinkers</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.319" end="00:07:20.639" style="s2">so they i say that evolutionary biology</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.919" end="00:07:23.199" style="s2">put a gun to its head in the 1940s</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.639" end="00:07:24.160" style="s2">and blew its brains out and we&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.199" end="00:07:27.440" style="s2">in the shadow</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.160" end="00:07:28.840" style="s2">of that event today so i decided that</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.440" end="00:07:31.039" style="s2">you know i was vitally interested in</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.840" end="00:07:33.039" style="s2">evolution i was vitally</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.039" end="00:07:34.639" style="s2">interested in the big picture i was</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.039" end="00:07:35.680" style="s2">vitally interested in intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.639" end="00:07:38.720" style="s2">creativity</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.680" end="00:07:41.360" style="s2">and therefore i should leave university</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.720" end="00:07:41.919" style="s2">and not be an academic so everything</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.360" end="00:07:45.039" style="s2">i&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.919" end="00:07:48.639" style="s2">since then i&#39;ve written a book uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.039" end="00:07:50.400" style="s2">you know i&#39;ve had about 14 i think now</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.639" end="00:07:51.680" style="s2">papers big picture papers published in</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.400" end="00:07:53.280" style="s2">international science journals</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.680" end="00:07:56.960" style="s2">peer-reviewed science journals</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.280" end="00:08:00.240" style="s2">but all that has been has been</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.960" end="00:08:04.000" style="s2">uh not the way i earn my money</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.240" end="00:08:05.840" style="s2">so i&#39;ve i&#39;ve been a trade union official</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.000" end="00:08:08.319" style="s2">a government advisor</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.840" end="00:08:10.319" style="s2">on wages policy and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.319" end="00:08:10.800" style="s2">that&#39;s how i had my money then i retired</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.319" end="00:08:14.479" style="s2">early</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.800" end="00:08:17.759" style="s2">and and but all this has been done</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.479" end="00:08:18.800" style="s2">uh where i had intellectual freedom you</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.759" end="00:08:20.960" style="s2">in my experience you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.800" end="00:08:22.960" style="s2">intellectual freedom in the academy</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.960" end="00:08:24.960" style="s2">in the university you know you get</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.960" end="00:08:27.039" style="s2">intellectual freedom by finding</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.960" end="00:08:28.560" style="s2">an easy way to make the sufficient money</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.039" end="00:08:31.840" style="s2">to live</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.560" end="00:08:33.120" style="s2">happily on and raise a family and use</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.840" end="00:08:36.240" style="s2">your spare time to</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.120" end="00:08:39.599" style="s2">um to do the thinking</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.240" end="00:08:41.120" style="s2">so your your affiliation with the free</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.599" end="00:08:44.080" style="s2">university of brussels</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.120" end="00:08:45.839" style="s2">is is just to give you an academic home</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.080" end="00:08:47.040" style="s2">when you do need to have an affiliation</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.839" end="00:08:49.360" style="s2">to publish a paper or</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.040" end="00:08:52.640" style="s2">how did that link establish it well i</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.360" end="00:08:54.160" style="s2">wrote my book evolutions arrow</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.640" end="00:08:56.399" style="s2">which is a book largely about the</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.160" end="00:08:58.240" style="s2">evolution of cooperation</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.399" end="00:09:00.560" style="s2">and as my daughters pointed out to me</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.240" end="00:09:02.560" style="s2">you know the irony is that</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.560" end="00:09:04.959" style="s2">no one i never worked with anyone on my</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.560" end="00:09:08.800" style="s2">my ideas it was</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.959" end="00:09:12.000" style="s2">it was a totally solid</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.800" end="00:09:15.040" style="s2">that&#39;s right so it was</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.000" end="00:09:16.720" style="s2">yeah i never uh no one else read it i</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.040" end="00:09:17.279" style="s2">never discussed the ideas with anyone or</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.720" end="00:09:19.279" style="s2">any</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.279" end="00:09:21.920" style="s2">any anything else so anyway when the</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.279" end="00:09:25.040" style="s2">book came out and i circulated and so on</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.920" end="00:09:26.560" style="s2">francis haligan who&#39;s the head of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.040" end="00:09:28.560" style="s2">research group at the university of</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.560" end="00:09:30.080" style="s2">brussels the evolution complexity and</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.560" end="00:09:32.720" style="s2">cognition research group</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.080" end="00:09:34.080" style="s2">and he developed principia cybernetica</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.720" end="00:09:38.240" style="s2">which was</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.080" end="00:09:40.399" style="s2">uh you know a site a</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.240" end="00:09:42.720" style="s2">complex set of resources on complexity</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.399" end="00:09:44.160" style="s2">thinking cybernetics and so on a major</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.720" end="00:09:47.200" style="s2">achievement in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.160" end="00:09:48.880" style="s2">90s so he he read the book</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.200" end="00:09:51.279" style="s2">and knew that i had no affiliation and</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.880" end="00:09:54.720" style="s2">said well come and join us and you can</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.279" end="00:09:55.440" style="s2">yeah that can be your formal affiliation</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.720" end="00:09:59.440" style="s2">and so on</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.440" end="00:10:01.920" style="s2">so that gives me some some status within</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.440" end="00:10:03.760" style="s2">academia but my main status within</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.920" end="00:10:06.640" style="s2">academia is that</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.760" end="00:10:07.760" style="s2">that i&#39;m not part of academia yet i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.640" end="00:10:11.440" style="s2">had these</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.760" end="00:10:12.959" style="s2">despite that i&#39;ve successfully had</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.440" end="00:10:14.720" style="s2">significant papers published in</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.959" end="00:10:17.600" style="s2">international peer-reviewed journals</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.720" end="00:10:19.200" style="s2">so in a way you know i would say my</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.600" end="00:10:21.040" style="s2">credentials are better than those who</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.200" end="00:10:24.399" style="s2">simply got them by</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.040" end="00:10:26.079" style="s2">passing exams and so on yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.399" end="00:10:28.720" style="s2">well i mean i i resonate in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.079" end="00:10:30.959" style="s2">that that i i also always felt that</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.720" end="00:10:32.160" style="s2">to really do the the research i wanted</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.959" end="00:10:34.160" style="s2">to do um</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.160" end="00:10:36.000" style="s2">i was better off outside of the normal</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.160" end="00:10:36.959" style="s2">conventional academic system rather than</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.000" end="00:10:39.200" style="s2">inside and</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.959" end="00:10:40.640" style="s2">i mean i also started as a marine</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.200" end="00:10:42.399" style="s2">biologist and then the</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.640" end="00:10:43.920" style="s2">masters in holistic science and then a</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.399" end="00:10:45.360" style="s2">phd in design</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.920" end="00:10:46.959" style="s2">because i thought that design would give</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.360" end="00:10:50.160" style="s2">me more freedom but then</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.959" end="00:10:51.600" style="s2">um yeah the funding landscape was very</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.160" end="00:10:54.959" style="s2">difficult at the time and</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.600" end="00:10:57.360" style="s2">i i felt a lot more freedom um</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.959" end="00:10:58.480" style="s2">reaching into academia rather than being</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.360" end="00:11:01.279" style="s2">in it um</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.480" end="00:11:02.160" style="s2">that&#39;s right well well academia i think</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.279" end="00:11:05.440" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.160" end="00:11:08.160" style="s2">named tron chomsky said that the inside</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.440" end="00:11:10.079" style="s2">of a modern major corporation</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.160" end="00:11:12.160" style="s2">is the most totalitarian environment</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.079" end="00:11:15.839" style="s2">that&#39;s ever existed in history</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.160" end="00:11:18.320" style="s2">um but you know i would say that</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.839" end="00:11:19.120" style="s2">corpora corporations are trumped by</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.320" end="00:11:21.680" style="s2">academia</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.120" end="00:11:22.959" style="s2">academic academic departments are feudal</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.680" end="00:11:23.839" style="s2">you know they&#39;re designed by feudal</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.959" end="00:11:26.640" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.839" end="00:11:27.279" style="s2">they&#39;re not designed to reward and</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.640" end="00:11:30.079" style="s2">generate</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.279" end="00:11:31.440" style="s2">creativity and innovative thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.079" end="00:11:35.600" style="s2">so on</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.440" end="00:11:38.079" style="s2">i mean i often lamented that and then i</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.600" end="00:11:39.519" style="s2">i also trying to kind of sort of turn it</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.079" end="00:11:42.959" style="s2">around and understand why</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.519" end="00:11:45.519" style="s2">is this why has this pattern evolved</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.959" end="00:11:47.279" style="s2">um it&#39;s it&#39;s very it takes a very</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.519" end="00:11:48.079" style="s2">special kind of person if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.279" end="00:11:50.399" style="s2">professor</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.079" end="00:11:52.800" style="s2">and you&#39;ve been slowly climbing on the</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.399" end="00:11:56.079" style="s2">top of that heap of academia</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.800" end="00:11:59.279" style="s2">and um you spent 30 40 years</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.079" end="00:12:00.880" style="s2">based on a certain set of core ideas</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.279" end="00:12:02.639" style="s2">doing your research publishing your</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.880" end="00:12:04.800" style="s2">books publishing your paper</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.639" end="00:12:06.000" style="s2">papers and then you get a bright young</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.800" end="00:12:08.639" style="s2">student</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.000" end="00:12:09.440" style="s2">publisher paper that completely derails</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.639" end="00:12:12.800" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.440" end="00:12:13.279" style="s2">that you&#39;ve you&#39;ve done and while on the</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.800" end="00:12:16.639" style="s2">one hand</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.279" end="00:12:18.480" style="s2">in theory that&#39;s how science goes in</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.639" end="00:12:20.000" style="s2">human practice there it is</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.480" end="00:12:22.320" style="s2">understandable that</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.000" end="00:12:23.839" style="s2">that professors are then going who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.320" end="00:12:24.800" style="s2">this young up start and they don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.839" end="00:12:27.839" style="s2">what they&#39;re doing and</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.800" end="00:12:31.200" style="s2">and and so there&#39;s this suppression of</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.839" end="00:12:32.800" style="s2">of new insight um because people find it</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.200" end="00:12:34.399" style="s2">hard to admit that</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.800" end="00:12:36.320" style="s2">they might have spent 30 years barking</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.399" end="00:12:39.120" style="s2">up the wrong tree</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.320" end="00:12:40.560" style="s2">and it is a you know a hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.120" end="00:12:42.959" style="s2">system where</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.560" end="00:12:43.920" style="s2">that person who has his reputation to</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.959" end="00:12:45.760" style="s2">protect</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.920" end="00:12:47.360" style="s2">actually has happens to have the power</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.760" end="00:12:50.959" style="s2">to suppress you</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.360" end="00:12:52.639" style="s2">um so they can yeah it&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.959" end="00:12:54.399" style="s2">if they act in their own interests then</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.639" end="00:12:55.120" style="s2">rather than that act as an invisible</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.399" end="00:12:57.279" style="s2">hand that</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.120" end="00:12:59.040" style="s2">you know produces good in the world</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.279" end="00:12:59.920" style="s2">they&#39;re more likely to use it to</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.040" end="00:13:01.360" style="s2">suppress you</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.920" end="00:13:03.279" style="s2">and and then there&#39;s another layer not</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.360" end="00:13:04.959" style="s2">that i want to go into critiquing</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.279" end="00:13:06.880" style="s2">university in academia</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.959" end="00:13:08.480" style="s2">in this conversation but but what i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.880" end="00:13:11.120" style="s2">also noticed is that</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.480" end="00:13:13.200" style="s2">those people who make political power</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.120" end="00:13:16.079" style="s2">careers within the university system</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.200" end="00:13:17.680" style="s2">as organizations are often not the</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.079" end="00:13:19.600" style="s2">passionate researchers not</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.680" end="00:13:21.680" style="s2">the people who are there to share with</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.600" end="00:13:23.760" style="s2">their students their love for</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.680" end="00:13:25.680" style="s2">for knowledge and inquiry but it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.760" end="00:13:26.720" style="s2">the the political beasts who want to get</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.680" end="00:13:30.320" style="s2">the bigger paycheck</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.720" end="00:13:33.279" style="s2">and um so i i often feel like in</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.320" end="00:13:33.279" style="s2">universities the</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.360" end="00:13:37.200" style="s2">four-let four letter gap floats to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.480" end="00:13:40.320" style="s2">top</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.200" end="00:13:42.160" style="s2">um that is is very often</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.320" end="00:13:44.160" style="s2">unfortunately the case and then you get</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.160" end="00:13:47.040" style="s2">the really brilliant researchers</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.160" end="00:13:50.079" style="s2">being managed by not so brilliant and</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.040" end="00:13:50.079" style="s2">slightly um</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.839" end="00:13:55.440" style="s2">mistakenly motivated individuals that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.160" end="00:13:56.959" style="s2">right the power</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.440" end="00:13:58.800" style="s2">but but i would like to come come back</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.959" end="00:14:00.480" style="s2">to the because you already mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.800" end="00:14:03.839" style="s2">that word that that makes me</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.480" end="00:14:05.279" style="s2">so interested in your take on evolution</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.839" end="00:14:07.680" style="s2">i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.279" end="00:14:09.680" style="s2">the word cooperation and that in your</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.680" end="00:14:12.880" style="s2">work you you very clearly</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.680" end="00:14:14.800" style="s2">are building models of an understanding</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.880" end="00:14:18.160" style="s2">of evolution that</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.800" end="00:14:21.279" style="s2">goes beyond this to my mind fallacy</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.160" end="00:14:23.279" style="s2">that we um focus on</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.279" end="00:14:25.519" style="s2">or have focus for far too long on</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.279" end="00:14:28.800" style="s2">competition as the main driver</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.519" end="00:14:31.279" style="s2">um of of evolution and don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.800" end="00:14:33.120" style="s2">the the cooperative dynamics that</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.279" end="00:14:34.480" style="s2">actually underlie in a much more</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.120" end="00:14:38.079" style="s2">substantial way</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.480" end="00:14:41.040" style="s2">um the the kind of competitive behaviors</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.079" end="00:14:42.160" style="s2">that that float on the top um so i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.040" end="00:14:44.560" style="s2">love i&#39;d love to hear</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.160" end="00:14:45.440" style="s2">more about your take on the role of</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.560" end="00:14:48.000" style="s2">cooperation</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.440" end="00:14:50.160" style="s2">in in the evolutionary process right</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.000" end="00:14:53.920" style="s2">because that yeah that is the main theme</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.160" end="00:14:55.279" style="s2">of my work um so i suppose</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.920" end="00:14:57.120" style="s2">you know the first general principle is</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.279" end="00:14:59.199" style="s2">it&#39;s obvious in human affairs</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.120" end="00:15:01.120" style="s2">that an organized group cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.199" end="00:15:03.920" style="s2">group of humans</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.120" end="00:15:05.440" style="s2">can beat an individual human at almost</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.920" end="00:15:08.320" style="s2">any activity</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.440" end="00:15:09.279" style="s2">so the you know the most competitive the</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.320" end="00:15:12.320" style="s2">fittest</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.279" end="00:15:14.160" style="s2">is going to be the cooperative so that</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.320" end="00:15:16.000" style="s2">and it&#39;s easy to see why i mean a</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.160" end="00:15:19.120" style="s2">cooperative group</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.000" end="00:15:21.440" style="s2">uh has command over more resources uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.120" end="00:15:23.839" style="s2">can act on a larger scale</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.440" end="00:15:24.480" style="s2">uh can do many things that an isolated</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.839" end="00:15:26.880" style="s2">individual</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.480" end="00:15:29.839" style="s2">can&#39;t now that that general principle</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.880" end="00:15:32.959" style="s2">applies at every level</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.839" end="00:15:36.160" style="s2">so it applies at the molecular level</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.959" end="00:15:37.759" style="s2">so you have uh an autopoetic or auto</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.160" end="00:15:40.880" style="s2">catalytic set</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.759" end="00:15:43.920" style="s2">of molecular processes that can</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.880" end="00:15:48.320" style="s2">collectively reproduce themselves</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.920" end="00:15:48.320" style="s2">and they will persist where individual</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.959" end="00:15:52.959" style="s2">individuals that aren&#39;t part of an auto</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.639" end="00:15:55.279" style="s2">catalytic set</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.959" end="00:15:56.160" style="s2">won&#39;t persist so an auto catalytic set</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.279" end="00:15:58.240" style="s2">because this</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.160" end="00:16:00.240" style="s2">is highly related to autopilosis which i</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.240" end="00:16:03.440" style="s2">know you&#39;ve written and thought about</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.240" end="00:16:06.800" style="s2">considerably an auto catalytic set is a</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.440" end="00:16:10.320" style="s2">set of entities at any level where</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.800" end="00:16:12.320" style="s2">every member of the set uh is catalyzed</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.320" end="00:16:14.240" style="s2">or supported by at least one other</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.320" end="00:16:16.800" style="s2">member of the set</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.240" end="00:16:17.759" style="s2">so in in ecosystems you get these auto</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.800" end="00:16:21.759" style="s2">catalytic</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.759" end="00:16:25.040" style="s2">assemblages of species where species a</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.759" end="00:16:29.360" style="s2">promotes the existence of b and b c and</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.040" end="00:16:31.600" style="s2">and c d and then d promotes a</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.360" end="00:16:33.839" style="s2">so once you get the closing of that</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.600" end="00:16:37.199" style="s2">autocad catalytic system</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.839" end="00:16:39.600" style="s2">then every member of it&#39;s pumped up uh</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.199" end="00:16:41.680" style="s2">by by other members of the set and it</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.600" end="00:16:45.519" style="s2">becomes a self-sustaining</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.680" end="00:16:48.639" style="s2">auto poetic self-producing system</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.519" end="00:16:50.720" style="s2">uh so that&#39;s that&#39;s the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.639" end="00:16:53.920" style="s2">beginning of life</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.720" end="00:16:55.040" style="s2">was the auto catalytic set of uh</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.920" end="00:16:57.199" style="s2">catalysts</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.040" end="00:16:59.120" style="s2">of protein catalysts that supported each</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.199" end="00:17:02.160" style="s2">other this is linked to</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.120" end="00:17:05.360" style="s2">prior genes work or</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.160" end="00:17:08.400" style="s2">no it&#39;s no it&#39;s more stewart kaufman</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.360" end="00:17:12.079" style="s2">uh yeah he was the</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.400" end="00:17:12.480" style="s2">the key the um the first one to you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.079" end="00:17:15.760" style="s2">write</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.480" end="00:17:18.480" style="s2">extensively about this in his uh i think</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.760" end="00:17:20.640" style="s2">his 1992 or three book</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.480" end="00:17:21.520" style="s2">uh where he talks about all getting</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.640" end="00:17:24.000" style="s2">order for free</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.520" end="00:17:25.679" style="s2">and order for free is when the snake</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.000" end="00:17:28.160" style="s2">hits its tail</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.679" end="00:17:28.960" style="s2">so you&#39;ve seen the the esoteric symbol</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.160" end="00:17:31.600" style="s2">of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.960" end="00:17:33.200" style="s2">the snake in his tail that&#39;s where the</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.600" end="00:17:36.000" style="s2">set of catalysts</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.200" end="00:17:37.600" style="s2">eat their own tail clo become a closed</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.000" end="00:17:39.520" style="s2">system that pumps itself up</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.600" end="00:17:41.200" style="s2">it&#39;s also you know the clearest example</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.520" end="00:17:43.120" style="s2">of autopilosis</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.200" end="00:17:46.240" style="s2">in the sense that it&#39;s self-producing</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.120" end="00:17:48.480" style="s2">because everything is produced</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.240" end="00:17:50.880" style="s2">by other members of that set and it</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.480" end="00:17:52.480" style="s2">becomes a self-producing system</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.880" end="00:17:54.080" style="s2">uh so you can get that at any level you</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.480" end="00:17:55.760" style="s2">get in ecosystems</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.080" end="00:17:57.200" style="s2">you can see it in human activities all</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.760" end="00:18:00.799" style="s2">the time where</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.200" end="00:18:03.840" style="s2">you know someone someone</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.799" end="00:18:06.000" style="s2">in in economic systems where a</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.840" end="00:18:07.840" style="s2">corporation assists cooperates with</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.000" end="00:18:11.440" style="s2">another and then another and another and</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.840" end="00:18:15.280" style="s2">and so on the cycles closed so you</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.440" end="00:18:18.000" style="s2">so that happens at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.280" end="00:18:18.480" style="s2">that&#39;s the first uh beginnings of life</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.000" end="00:18:21.440" style="s2">at</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.480" end="00:18:23.120" style="s2">the auto catalytic set of of proteins</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.440" end="00:18:24.880" style="s2">but it&#39;s not yet living as i&#39;ll go into</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.120" end="00:18:26.320" style="s2">a little bit more detail but</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.880" end="00:18:29.120" style="s2">that&#39;s the first cooperative system that</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.320" end="00:18:31.360" style="s2">you use it starts with cooperation</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.120" end="00:18:32.480" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t start with a naked molecule a</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.360" end="00:18:35.200" style="s2">naked gene</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.480" end="00:18:37.039" style="s2">reproducing itself because the</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.200" end="00:18:40.160" style="s2">probability of that arising is</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.039" end="00:18:42.000" style="s2">you know is infinitesimal it&#39;s from the</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.160" end="00:18:43.520" style="s2">system that reproduces through</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.000" end="00:18:47.039" style="s2">cooperation</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.520" end="00:18:50.400" style="s2">uh is far more likely to arise</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.039" end="00:18:54.000" style="s2">as kaufman demonstrates um than</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.400" end="00:18:57.039" style="s2">the naked self-replicating molecule</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.000" end="00:19:00.080" style="s2">briefly and to get back to</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.039" end="00:19:02.880" style="s2">the way you described it sort of m a b</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.080" end="00:19:04.400" style="s2">c d and d d then gets help from a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.880" end="00:19:08.160" style="s2">sort of linear chain but</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.400" end="00:19:08.720" style="s2">isn&#39;t there also where the activities of</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.160" end="00:19:11.679" style="s2">a b</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.720" end="00:19:13.440" style="s2">c and d collectively change the</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.679" end="00:19:16.400" style="s2">conditions in the environment</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.440" end="00:19:16.960" style="s2">that then actually support all all of</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.400" end="00:19:19.840" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.960" end="00:19:20.160" style="s2">um through the change in the environment</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.840" end="00:19:23.760" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.160" end="00:19:26.960" style="s2">i&#39;m just thinking about um the phases</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.760" end="00:19:30.320" style="s2">in terms of planetary shifts where</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.960" end="00:19:33.200" style="s2">we went from a um</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.320" end="00:19:35.840" style="s2">atmosphere that was full of methane and</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.200" end="00:19:37.039" style="s2">and co2 to more oxygen that was actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.840" end="00:19:39.600" style="s2">generated by the</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.039" end="00:19:40.400" style="s2">early like the cells in the early oceans</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.600" end="00:19:43.360" style="s2">they then</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.400" end="00:19:43.919" style="s2">allowed the possibility for life on land</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.360" end="00:19:47.039" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.919" end="00:19:49.600" style="s2">to evolve um is that that&#39;s right so</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.039" end="00:19:51.120" style="s2">so and that&#39;s that becomes a really</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.600" end="00:19:54.160" style="s2">important issue in what i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.120" end="00:19:57.919" style="s2">what i&#39;ll discuss next but the</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.160" end="00:19:59.679" style="s2">but yes there can be uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.919" end="00:20:01.360" style="s2">you know other events that are created</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.679" end="00:20:05.039" style="s2">by this auto permit except</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.360" end="00:20:08.960" style="s2">that feed back and support its existence</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.039" end="00:20:12.480" style="s2">um the problem becomes uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.960" end="00:20:15.919" style="s2">that there is</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.480" end="00:20:19.360" style="s2">there is nothing in the system that</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.919" end="00:20:20.000" style="s2">that encourages that behavior or fixes</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.360" end="00:20:21.679" style="s2">it or</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.000" end="00:20:24.159" style="s2">pumps up that behavior it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.679" end="00:20:25.679" style="s2">self-sustaining but it can easily just</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.159" end="00:20:27.200" style="s2">break down as well and there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.679" end="00:20:29.440" style="s2">to bring it back into</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.200" end="00:20:30.240" style="s2">alignment but but i&#39;ll i&#39;ll get into</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.440" end="00:20:32.960" style="s2">that so</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.240" end="00:20:34.000" style="s2">anyway so the critical thing is you get</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.960" end="00:20:37.360" style="s2">self-reproducing</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.000" end="00:20:40.640" style="s2">molecular processes and then you get</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.360" end="00:20:43.679" style="s2">cooperative groups of self replica</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.640" end="00:20:47.280" style="s2">of self-producing molecular processes to</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.679" end="00:20:48.799" style="s2">to form the uh the first simple cells</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.280" end="00:20:50.400" style="s2">and then you get groups of those simple</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.799" end="00:20:53.360" style="s2">cells to form the</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.400" end="00:20:54.960" style="s2">eukaryote cell uh and then you get</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.360" end="00:20:56.799" style="s2">cooperative groups of cells to form</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.960" end="00:20:58.400" style="s2">multicellular organisms</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.799" end="00:21:00.000" style="s2">and then you get cooperative groups of</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.400" end="00:21:01.360" style="s2">multicellular organisms to form animal</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.000" end="00:21:04.080" style="s2">societies</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.360" end="00:21:05.600" style="s2">of which humans are you know the example</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.080" end="00:21:07.280" style="s2">most significant to us</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.600" end="00:21:09.760" style="s2">and the human society started off as</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.280" end="00:21:11.440" style="s2">little kin groups little family groups</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.760" end="00:21:13.679" style="s2">uh and then you&#39;ve got assemblages of</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.440" end="00:21:16.960" style="s2">kin cooperatives of kin groups</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.679" end="00:21:18.480" style="s2">to form bands then cooperatives of bands</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.960" end="00:21:20.960" style="s2">to form tribes</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.480" end="00:21:22.799" style="s2">and cooperative of tribes to form</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.960" end="00:21:25.039" style="s2">agricultural societies</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.799" end="00:21:27.600" style="s2">and eventually empires and then you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.039" end="00:21:28.640" style="s2">got cooperatives to form nations nation</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.600" end="00:21:31.840" style="s2">states</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.640" end="00:21:32.640" style="s2">which are now the biggest organisms on</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.840" end="00:21:34.159" style="s2">the planet</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.640" end="00:21:36.080" style="s2">but that&#39;s interesting because the last</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.159" end="00:21:39.520" style="s2">three stages you you named from</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.080" end="00:21:42.320" style="s2">from my perspective um aren&#39;t entirely</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.520" end="00:21:44.720" style="s2">like they&#39;ve enabled a lot of amazing</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.320" end="00:21:46.559" style="s2">things to happen in in human history</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.720" end="00:21:48.000" style="s2">but but they&#39;re also to some extent</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.559" end="00:21:51.600" style="s2">where we started</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.000" end="00:21:52.000" style="s2">to uh like a step towards agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.600" end="00:21:53.679" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.000" end="00:21:55.039" style="s2">stepped towards cities in the step</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.679" end="00:21:58.159" style="s2">towards nation states</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.039" end="00:22:00.960" style="s2">um we we actually started to create</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.159" end="00:22:02.400" style="s2">more competitive structures um rather</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.960" end="00:22:04.400" style="s2">than cooperative structures and</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.400" end="00:22:06.080" style="s2">what comes well that&#39;s what that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.400" end="00:22:09.200" style="s2">drives the trajectory</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.080" end="00:22:10.640" style="s2">so i mean the most startling thing in</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.200" end="00:22:13.440" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.640" end="00:22:15.600" style="s2">trajectory of the evolution of life is</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.440" end="00:22:18.640" style="s2">that the first cooperatives</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.600" end="00:22:19.760" style="s2">were a micron less than a micron in</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.640" end="00:22:21.520" style="s2">diameter</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.760" end="00:22:23.760" style="s2">less than a million for the meter so</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.520" end="00:22:27.840" style="s2">these first little protocells</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.760" end="00:22:27.840" style="s2">you know invisible to the human eye</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.919" end="00:22:31.760" style="s2">and successfully throughout that process</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.760" end="00:22:34.559" style="s2">because you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.760" end="00:22:35.440" style="s2">cooperation of of entities at one level</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.559" end="00:22:37.280" style="s2">producing the</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.440" end="00:22:38.559" style="s2">entities at a new level that then forms</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.280" end="00:22:41.039" style="s2">cooperatives</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.559" end="00:22:42.880" style="s2">you get this increase in scale so now we</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.039" end="00:22:45.919" style="s2">have cooperatives</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.880" end="00:22:47.520" style="s2">that can span a continent and</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.919" end="00:22:49.360" style="s2">the next step&#39;s obvious you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.520" end="00:22:51.440" style="s2">extrapolate that process it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.360" end="00:22:52.880" style="s2">a cooperative on the scale of the planet</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.440" end="00:22:56.080" style="s2">you know it&#39;s a planetary</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.880" end="00:22:58.320" style="s2">society um</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.080" end="00:23:00.640" style="s2">so the so that you know the trend the</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.320" end="00:23:03.039" style="s2">trend is startling undeniable</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.640" end="00:23:04.159" style="s2">clear but so what drive so what drives</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.039" end="00:23:06.240" style="s2">it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.159" end="00:23:07.520" style="s2">what drives it is the cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.240" end="00:23:10.960" style="s2">advantage</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.520" end="00:23:12.400" style="s2">uh the advantages of cooperation of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.960" end="00:23:14.480" style="s2">the new entities are formed out of</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.400" end="00:23:15.600" style="s2">cooperatives then they start to form</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.480" end="00:23:17.840" style="s2">cooperatives</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.600" end="00:23:18.880" style="s2">and those cooperatives beat the isolated</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.840" end="00:23:21.039" style="s2">entities</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.880" end="00:23:22.159" style="s2">and then those cooperatives form new</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.039" end="00:23:24.480" style="s2">entities</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.159" end="00:23:25.919" style="s2">and then they form cooperatives which</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.480" end="00:23:29.440" style="s2">are more effective so</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.919" end="00:23:32.240" style="s2">so it is a dance between cooperation and</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.440" end="00:23:33.360" style="s2">competition yeah the sentence just</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.240" end="00:23:34.000" style="s2">because it fits really well here the</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.360" end="00:23:36.240" style="s2">sentence i</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.000" end="00:23:37.440" style="s2">alluded to earlier that i um it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.240" end="00:23:40.799" style="s2">kind of um</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.440" end="00:23:41.840" style="s2">not a direct quote but uh um based on</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.799" end="00:23:45.039" style="s2">your work is</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.840" end="00:23:46.080" style="s2">i love the way you&#39;ve put it in one of</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.039" end="00:23:49.360" style="s2">your papers that the</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.080" end="00:23:53.760" style="s2">um i think it was the bio systems</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.360" end="00:23:57.120" style="s2">paper on the evolution of cooperation in</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.760" end="00:23:58.640" style="s2">you say evolution functions by a pattern</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.120" end="00:24:00.960" style="s2">of diversification</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.640" end="00:24:03.840" style="s2">and subsequent reintegration of that</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.960" end="00:24:06.320" style="s2">diversity at higher levels of complexity</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.840" end="00:24:08.559" style="s2">and comes the most important sentence</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.320" end="00:24:08.559" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.200" end="00:24:14.320" style="s2">in most situations that jump to that new</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.400" end="00:24:16.640" style="s2">level of organizations and higher levels</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.320" end="00:24:20.159" style="s2">of complexity is a cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.640" end="00:24:22.559" style="s2">a new form of cooperation and and</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.159" end="00:24:24.000" style="s2">it&#39;s just from listening to you now i</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.559" end="00:24:26.000" style="s2">haven&#39;t really clicked on that</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.000" end="00:24:27.200" style="s2">the scale of it actually grows in each</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.000" end="00:24:30.559" style="s2">step because</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.200" end="00:24:33.679" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of starting with the indus</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.559" end="00:24:36.880" style="s2">symbiosis theory of of two non-nu</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.679" end="00:24:38.960" style="s2">um pro two prokaryotes okay</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.880" end="00:24:40.640" style="s2">together and not digesting each other</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.960" end="00:24:43.679" style="s2">completely but forming the first</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.640" end="00:24:47.279" style="s2">proto-euka you carry a nucleated cell</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.679" end="00:24:50.799" style="s2">and then at each step you you get larger</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.279" end="00:24:53.440" style="s2">um cooperative organizations yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.799" end="00:24:54.960" style="s2">and that and the it actually yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.440" end="00:24:58.880" style="s2">precedes the um</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.960" end="00:25:00.960" style="s2">you know the margulies uh endosymbiosis</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.880" end="00:25:05.120" style="s2">story as well in the sense that the</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.960" end="00:25:06.640" style="s2">a cell is is so it&#39;s the auto catalytic</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.120" end="00:25:08.880" style="s2">set of proteins</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.640" end="00:25:10.400" style="s2">which are then governed by rna so the</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.880" end="00:25:13.919" style="s2">first symbiosis</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.400" end="00:25:14.640" style="s2">the first big cooperation was the rna</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.919" end="00:25:17.760" style="s2">with the</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.640" end="00:25:22.400" style="s2">metabolism the the the protein</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.760" end="00:25:22.400" style="s2">uh now um</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.799" end="00:25:27.039" style="s2">the so at every level the quad you get</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.279" end="00:25:29.360" style="s2">the cooperatives formed</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.039" end="00:25:30.559" style="s2">and then they compete with other they</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.360" end="00:25:33.760" style="s2">breed diversity</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.559" end="00:25:37.760" style="s2">diversify and compete with one another</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.760" end="00:25:42.480" style="s2">and that that competition um</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.760" end="00:25:46.400" style="s2">uh they can be</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.480" end="00:25:48.880" style="s2">won by a larger scale cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.400" end="00:25:50.559" style="s2">formed out of those cooperatives so</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.880" end="00:25:51.360" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s what drives the process</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.559" end="00:25:54.480" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.360" end="00:25:56.559" style="s2">there&#39;s um the formation of a</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.480" end="00:26:00.000" style="s2">cooperative at a particular level</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.559" end="00:26:02.159" style="s2">only solves the cooperation problem</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.000" end="00:26:03.840" style="s2">and only exploits the advantages of</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.159" end="00:26:07.200" style="s2">cooperation</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.840" end="00:26:09.120" style="s2">at that level at that scale there are</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.200" end="00:26:10.400" style="s2">further advantages that haven&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.120" end="00:26:11.840" style="s2">exploited</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.400" end="00:26:13.919" style="s2">and those advantages can only be</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.840" end="00:26:16.000" style="s2">exploited by a yet larger scale</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.919" end="00:26:20.320" style="s2">cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.000" end="00:26:23.039" style="s2">and then those cooperatives compete uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.320" end="00:26:25.279" style="s2">and that leaves uh unexploited</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.039" end="00:26:27.760" style="s2">advantages of cooperation</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.279" end="00:26:30.480" style="s2">um at a higher level formed of</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.760" end="00:26:34.240" style="s2">cooperatives of those cooperatives</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.480" end="00:26:36.080" style="s2">um so the now and the important thing is</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.240" end="00:26:37.440" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.080" end="00:26:39.279" style="s2">at any point in time through</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.440" end="00:26:41.039" style="s2">evolutionary history</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.279" end="00:26:43.919" style="s2">the largest scale cooperatives that</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.039" end="00:26:45.200" style="s2">exist compete with one another</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.919" end="00:26:47.760" style="s2">and from their point of view that</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.200" end="00:26:52.000" style="s2">competition is destructive</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.760" end="00:26:55.039" style="s2">um so when you get uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.000" end="00:26:56.400" style="s2">uh tribes you know there never was a</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.039" end="00:26:58.240" style="s2">period</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.400" end="00:27:01.039" style="s2">uh you know the green and spiral</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.240" end="00:27:04.000" style="s2">dynamics terms fantasy</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.039" end="00:27:05.600" style="s2">the tribal societies were harmony it was</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.000" end="00:27:07.679" style="s2">a time of like the garden of eden where</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.600" end="00:27:10.400" style="s2">they&#39;re harmonious and so on</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.679" end="00:27:11.840" style="s2">so they&#39;re the highest level</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.400" end="00:27:13.760" style="s2">cooperatives of a particular level</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.840" end="00:27:14.880" style="s2">are harmonious and cooperative within</p>

<p begin="00:27:14.880" end="00:27:19.679" style="s2">but they compete so australian</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.919" end="00:27:22.799" style="s2">aborigines for example i remember being</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.679" end="00:27:25.919" style="s2">startled many years ago to</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.799" end="00:27:27.679" style="s2">to be told that it&#39;s very common in in</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.919" end="00:27:29.279" style="s2">aboriginal languages and there are many</p>

<p begin="00:27:29.279" end="00:27:34.080" style="s2">that whatever the language the term that</p>

<p begin="00:27:34.080" end="00:27:40.159" style="s2">tribes often is translated best</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.159" end="00:27:43.919" style="s2">translated as</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.159" end="00:27:45.760" style="s2">sub-human or animal</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.919" end="00:27:48.320" style="s2">and that of course legitimates you</p>

<p begin="00:27:48.399" end="00:27:51.840" style="s2">and you have to because you know imagine</p>

<p begin="00:27:51.840" end="00:27:57.120" style="s2">aborigines come to australia they expand</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.120" end="00:27:59.760" style="s2">fill the available volumes so to speak</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.120" end="00:28:02.559" style="s2">they form tribes and so on</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.760" end="00:28:03.440" style="s2">um you&#39;re going to get overpopulation</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.559" end="00:28:06.880" style="s2">any any</p>

<p begin="00:28:31.039" end="00:28:34.960" style="s2">um so that on that larger scale you get</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.279" end="00:28:36.480" style="s2">cooperation within it but you still get</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.960" end="00:28:38.320" style="s2">competition</p>

<p begin="00:31:30.320" end="00:31:34.159" style="s2">that&#39;s why in my work i work a lot with</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.039" end="00:31:37.120" style="s2">bioregionalism</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.159" end="00:31:38.000" style="s2">as as one attempt like watersheds just</p>

<p begin="00:31:38.000" end="00:31:42.799" style="s2">rough pattern because at least a</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.399" end="00:31:45.440" style="s2">watershed is a biophysical pattern</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.799" end="00:31:47.360" style="s2">not a sociopolitical pattern but then of</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.440" end="00:31:49.519" style="s2">course in our culture we we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.360" end="00:31:50.399" style="s2">we&#39;ve divorced from the biological</p>

<p begin="00:31:56.320" end="00:31:59.519" style="s2">many of the people sitting in those</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.840" end="00:32:00.320" style="s2">academic ivory towers we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.519" end="00:32:02.720" style="s2">earlier</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.320" end="00:32:05.519" style="s2">that honestly believe that culture and</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.720" end="00:32:09.840" style="s2">nature can be separated that somehow</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.519" end="00:32:13.360" style="s2">where we could develop technologies that</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.840" end="00:32:15.519" style="s2">would make us independent of our</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.360" end="00:32:18.000" style="s2">nature as biological beings which which</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.519" end="00:32:21.519" style="s2">i think is a bit deluded</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.000" end="00:32:23.279" style="s2">well yeah that that brings up</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.519" end="00:32:24.720" style="s2">probably the most critically important</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.279" end="00:32:27.600" style="s2">point that</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.720" end="00:32:28.720" style="s2">comes out of you know the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.600" end="00:32:31.200" style="s2">worldview that i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.720" end="00:32:32.399" style="s2">that i&#39;ve been developing and that is</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.200" end="00:32:35.840" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.399" end="00:32:36.880" style="s2">at lower levels when you had very large</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.840" end="00:32:39.840" style="s2">populations</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.880" end="00:32:41.279" style="s2">of cooperatives competing so the</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.840" end="00:32:44.000" style="s2">multicellular organisms</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.279" end="00:32:44.000" style="s2">you know and you have</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.559" end="00:32:48.720" style="s2">you know population sizes in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.240" end="00:32:52.240" style="s2">millions or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.720" end="00:32:53.120" style="s2">then you have you have competition</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.240" end="00:32:55.679" style="s2">between those</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.120" end="00:32:56.559" style="s2">cooperatives and the most effective ones</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.679" end="00:32:58.080" style="s2">survive</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.559" end="00:32:59.760" style="s2">and you get feedback loops from the</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.080" end="00:33:01.120" style="s2">environment and so on that wipe out</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.760" end="00:33:02.640" style="s2">those that destroy their local</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.120" end="00:33:05.679" style="s2">environment</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.640" end="00:33:07.360" style="s2">uh and so on so the in effect you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.679" end="00:33:09.200" style="s2">one way of saying it is is that natural</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.360" end="00:33:11.519" style="s2">selection disciplines</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.200" end="00:33:14.880" style="s2">the behavior of those you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.519" end="00:33:16.799" style="s2">multicellular cooperatives</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.880" end="00:33:18.399" style="s2">the problem we&#39;ve got in the world today</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.799" end="00:33:22.480" style="s2">is that there are</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.399" end="00:33:22.480" style="s2">under i think 200 nation states</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.799" end="00:33:27.039" style="s2">there is not a you know great turnover</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.559" end="00:33:28.799" style="s2">of nation states nation states don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.039" end="00:33:30.240" style="s2">you know have a thousand offspring that</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.799" end="00:33:32.320" style="s2">then compete and</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.240" end="00:33:33.679" style="s2">and and the most effective nation states</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.320" end="00:33:35.519" style="s2">survive and so on</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.679" end="00:33:38.480" style="s2">so you don&#39;t have that big discipline in</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.519" end="00:33:40.320" style="s2">that big feedback loop or anything else</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.480" end="00:33:41.919" style="s2">so so what you&#39;re pointing to this</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.320" end="00:33:44.320" style="s2">mismatch</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.919" end="00:33:45.600" style="s2">between nation states and their</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.320" end="00:33:48.240" style="s2">effective</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.600" end="00:33:49.039" style="s2">uh persistence in an environment in a</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.240" end="00:33:52.640" style="s2">way that</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.039" end="00:33:53.279" style="s2">is sustainable um you point to that</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.640" end="00:33:55.919" style="s2">mismatch</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.279" end="00:33:56.640" style="s2">yes if natural selection was operating</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.919" end="00:33:58.960" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.640" end="00:34:00.240" style="s2">populations of a million competing</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.960" end="00:34:04.159" style="s2">nation states</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.240" end="00:34:05.279" style="s2">it would sort all that out and only the</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.159" end="00:34:07.840" style="s2">the nation states that weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.279" end="00:34:09.599" style="s2">mismatched would survive</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.840" end="00:34:11.040" style="s2">but that&#39;s not happening there are only</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.599" end="00:34:13.200" style="s2">200 nation states</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.040" end="00:34:14.240" style="s2">it gets far worse when you take the next</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.200" end="00:34:18.320" style="s2">step</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.240" end="00:34:18.320" style="s2">because the next step is a global system</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.639" end="00:34:23.280" style="s2">there is no population of global systems</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.800" end="00:34:25.240" style="s2">there&#39;s only one</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.280" end="00:34:27.440" style="s2">so the you cannot have this continual</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.240" end="00:34:30.639" style="s2">experimentation</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.440" end="00:34:32.079" style="s2">which is the only way nature&#39;s ever</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.639" end="00:34:35.119" style="s2">discovered</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.079" end="00:34:38.560" style="s2">um to uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.119" end="00:34:40.159" style="s2">choose between complex systems uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.560" end="00:34:42.159" style="s2">and when i say the only way nature&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.159" end="00:34:43.520" style="s2">discovered i&#39;m including the human mind</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.159" end="00:34:47.040" style="s2">in that which is</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.520" end="00:34:48.879" style="s2">clearly part of nature uh the human mind</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.040" end="00:34:51.679" style="s2">is incapable</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.879" end="00:34:52.320" style="s2">uh of understanding complexity in</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.679" end="00:34:56.399" style="s2">general</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.320" end="00:34:59.040" style="s2">and uh designing and</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.399" end="00:35:00.160" style="s2">well designing is the wrong word anyway</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.040" end="00:35:02.400" style="s2">but growing</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.160" end="00:35:03.760" style="s2">complex systems that have particular</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.400" end="00:35:05.520" style="s2">effects that are predictable and</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.760" end="00:35:08.800" style="s2">controllable and so on</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.520" end="00:35:11.119" style="s2">um so the only way</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.800" end="00:35:11.839" style="s2">in in one of your more recent papers you</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.119" end="00:35:14.960" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.839" end="00:35:14.960" style="s2">what did you call it i</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.200" end="00:35:19.440" style="s2">i found it here hold on a minute um</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.040" end="00:35:28.079" style="s2">consequence capture yeah and and</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.320" end="00:35:28.560" style="s2">um that kind of fitted well for me or</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.079" end="00:35:30.960" style="s2">even</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.560" end="00:35:32.240" style="s2">also what you just said would again in</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.960" end="00:35:34.640" style="s2">my mind say</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.240" end="00:35:36.560" style="s2">if we want to create a global</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.640" end="00:35:39.680" style="s2">cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.560" end="00:35:42.240" style="s2">entity that coordinates</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.680" end="00:35:44.400" style="s2">fitting human patterns back into the</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.240" end="00:35:45.040" style="s2">biophysical patterns of the life support</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.400" end="00:35:46.800" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.040" end="00:35:48.079" style="s2">where part of emerge from and are</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.800" end="00:35:51.119" style="s2">dependent on</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.079" end="00:35:54.320" style="s2">then um we need to create</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.119" end="00:35:56.720" style="s2">our patterns in a scale linked way from</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.320" end="00:35:59.280" style="s2">from local to regional to global</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.720" end="00:36:00.800" style="s2">um but most of the patterns need to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.280" end="00:36:04.160" style="s2">at the regional scale</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.800" end="00:36:07.119" style="s2">so the feedback is quick enough and and</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.160" end="00:36:08.480" style="s2">you could easily then see how different</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.119" end="00:36:12.400" style="s2">cooperatives</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.480" end="00:36:15.119" style="s2">of different bioregions the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.400" end="00:36:15.839" style="s2">would have patterns that regenerate and</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.119" end="00:36:18.800" style="s2">restore</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.839" end="00:36:19.839" style="s2">and support the ecosystems health of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.800" end="00:36:22.880" style="s2">region they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.839" end="00:36:26.000" style="s2">will out compete the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.880" end="00:36:28.400" style="s2">draw too much on on their um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.000" end="00:36:29.200" style="s2">by region so so it&#39;s it&#39;s almost like</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.400" end="00:36:33.280" style="s2">we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.200" end="00:36:35.920" style="s2">we&#39;ve jumped to nation</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.280" end="00:36:37.599" style="s2">state scale without paying attention</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.920" end="00:36:39.280" style="s2">with losing like in the in the move</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.599" end="00:36:41.839" style="s2">towards globalization</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.280" end="00:36:42.960" style="s2">we sort of lost the multi-level</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.839" end="00:36:44.800" style="s2">redundancies</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.960" end="00:36:46.160" style="s2">at local and regional level that</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.800" end="00:36:47.920" style="s2">actually builds</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.160" end="00:36:49.200" style="s2">in terms of patterning of life as a</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.920" end="00:36:52.320" style="s2">planetary process</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.200" end="00:36:54.720" style="s2">builds the um resilience into the system</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.320" end="00:36:57.599" style="s2">that we can continue evolving</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.720" end="00:37:00.320" style="s2">yeah consequence capture has to follow</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.599" end="00:37:04.480" style="s2">the principle of subsidiarity</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.320" end="00:37:07.200" style="s2">which is you have you have the um</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.480" end="00:37:08.560" style="s2">you deal with issues at the most local</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.200" end="00:37:10.079" style="s2">level possible</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.560" end="00:37:12.000" style="s2">now some issues can&#39;t be dealt with</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.079" end="00:37:15.119" style="s2">except at the global level</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.000" end="00:37:16.560" style="s2">um and basically the definition of a of</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.119" end="00:37:19.599" style="s2">an issue that can&#39;t be</p>

<p begin="00:37:19.599" end="00:37:24.160" style="s2">an issue that has</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.839" end="00:37:25.119" style="s2">impacts beyond the borders of nation</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.160" end="00:37:27.040" style="s2">states</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.119" end="00:37:28.640" style="s2">so it&#39;s only through action across</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.040" end="00:37:30.560" style="s2">nation states</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.640" end="00:37:32.560" style="s2">that you can implement consequence</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.560" end="00:37:35.760" style="s2">capture</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.560" end="00:37:37.280" style="s2">in other words deal effectively with</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.760" end="00:37:39.440" style="s2">those sorts of issues and global warming</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.280" end="00:37:41.119" style="s2">is the classic one you know if america</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.440" end="00:37:41.680" style="s2">produces a stack of carbon dioxide</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.119" end="00:37:43.839" style="s2">there&#39;s no</p>

<p begin="00:37:43.839" end="00:37:48.320" style="s2">that can insulate it from</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.280" end="00:37:50.320" style="s2">those actions of america so it needs you</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.320" end="00:37:51.520" style="s2">need a system that reaches across nation</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.320" end="00:37:53.760" style="s2">states</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.520" end="00:37:55.280" style="s2">and coordinates their behavior and</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.760" end="00:37:58.560" style="s2">implements consequence capture</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.280" end="00:38:00.000" style="s2">so that&#39;s a good segue into constant</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.560" end="00:38:01.680" style="s2">capture consequence capture is the</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.000" end="00:38:03.520" style="s2">principle</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.680" end="00:38:05.839" style="s2">that i would argue applies at every</p>

<p begin="00:38:05.920" end="00:38:10.320" style="s2">to produce cooperatives that then evolve</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.200" end="00:38:13.599" style="s2">effectively</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.320" end="00:38:16.400" style="s2">as a coherent whole and evolving</p>

<p begin="00:38:16.400" end="00:38:22.560" style="s2">means that they develop agency plans</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.920" end="00:38:23.119" style="s2">uh actions on the outside world and so</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.560" end="00:38:24.480" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.119" end="00:38:26.960" style="s2">that&#39;s what happens to all these</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.480" end="00:38:29.359" style="s2">cooperatives that emerge at each step</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.960" end="00:38:31.440" style="s2">in the evolution of life on earth so</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.359" end="00:38:33.440" style="s2">consequence capture is simply that you</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.440" end="00:38:34.640" style="s2">they have to be mechanisms in place that</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.440" end="00:38:36.960" style="s2">ensure</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.640" end="00:38:38.800" style="s2">that the actions at every level within a</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.960" end="00:38:40.560" style="s2">cooperative organization</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.800" end="00:38:43.599" style="s2">uh the actions of any entity at any</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.560" end="00:38:47.200" style="s2">level um</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.599" end="00:38:49.599" style="s2">feedback or reflect back onto the entity</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.200" end="00:38:52.160" style="s2">the consequences of the effects of its</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.599" end="00:38:55.920" style="s2">actions on the entity as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.160" end="00:38:58.720" style="s2">so to give a more concrete example</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.920" end="00:39:00.560" style="s2">what it would mean for human beings if</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.720" end="00:39:03.440" style="s2">if we lived in societies that</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.560" end="00:39:04.400" style="s2">implemented consequence capture uh that</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.440" end="00:39:06.480" style="s2">ensured that</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.400" end="00:39:08.079" style="s2">individuals captured the consequences of</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.480" end="00:39:09.839" style="s2">their actions on the whole</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.079" end="00:39:11.119" style="s2">it would mean that if they acted in any</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.839" end="00:39:12.960" style="s2">in any way that</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.119" end="00:39:15.440" style="s2">you know had a detrimental impact on the</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.960" end="00:39:17.200" style="s2">environment then</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.440" end="00:39:20.000" style="s2">they there would be feedback mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.200" end="00:39:22.240" style="s2">which deterred them from doing that</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.000" end="00:39:24.960" style="s2">similarly if they acted in ways that had</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.240" end="00:39:26.480" style="s2">positive effects for the</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.960" end="00:39:28.240" style="s2">cooperative of humanity as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.480" end="00:39:32.640" style="s2">they&#39;d be rewarded for doing it</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.240" end="00:39:36.400" style="s2">so one one simple example is that</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.640" end="00:39:40.000" style="s2">in a properly organized planetary system</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.400" end="00:39:41.119" style="s2">you and i would be wealthy</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.000" end="00:39:43.680" style="s2">because we would capture the</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.119" end="00:39:46.880" style="s2">consequences of our actions on the</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.680" end="00:39:48.079" style="s2">whole um because because what we do is</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.880" end="00:39:50.160" style="s2">not profitable</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.079" end="00:39:52.240" style="s2">you know in fact we have to sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.160" end="00:39:55.119" style="s2">our opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.240" end="00:39:57.440" style="s2">you know to achieve the the things that</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.119" end="00:39:59.599" style="s2">society says of the supreme goals</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.440" end="00:40:00.720" style="s2">that is to make lots of money we have to</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.599" end="00:40:04.319" style="s2">we have to give that up</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.720" end="00:40:07.280" style="s2">we&#39;re deterred p far from being</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.319" end="00:40:08.880" style="s2">uh capturing the consequences of of</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.280" end="00:40:12.720" style="s2">trying to design</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.880" end="00:40:14.480" style="s2">systems that benefit humanity as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.720" end="00:40:16.880" style="s2">you know it costs us to do so we have to</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.480" end="00:40:20.400" style="s2">forego other opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.880" end="00:40:23.119" style="s2">um the another example i give is that</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.400" end="00:40:24.000" style="s2">so so what i generally do when i talk to</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.119" end="00:40:27.040" style="s2">people overseas</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.000" end="00:40:29.230" style="s2">is i apologize</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.040" end="00:40:31.280" style="s2">for rupert murdoch</p>

<p begin="00:40:52.640" end="00:40:56.319" style="s2">media empire but but the example i give</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.680" end="00:40:59.359" style="s2">is that if</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.319" end="00:41:02.400" style="s2">if a young rupert murdoch was in a</p>

<p begin="00:41:02.400" end="00:41:06.560" style="s2">capture applied then and he was plotting</p>

<p begin="00:41:06.560" end="00:41:10.000" style="s2">path you know in order to be uh he</p>

<p begin="00:41:14.640" end="00:41:18.800" style="s2">then instead of saying oh you know the</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.880" end="00:41:20.160" style="s2">way to make my billion is to uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.800" end="00:41:22.160" style="s2">have a media empire and manipulate</p>

<p begin="00:41:23.760" end="00:41:28.720" style="s2">capture applies then it will be</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.760" end="00:41:30.560" style="s2">might be far more profitable to uh</p>

<p begin="00:41:42.240" end="00:41:49.040" style="s2">a world in which uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.839" end="00:41:49.599" style="s2">when individuals within that system look</p>

<p begin="00:43:07.280" end="00:43:13.119" style="s2">would um would have consequence capture</p>

<p begin="00:44:38.800" end="00:44:44.000" style="s2">and to some extent i mean</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.920" end="00:44:45.599" style="s2">you mentioned aboriginal culture and in</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.000" end="00:44:47.040" style="s2">general indigenous culture is not</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.599" end="00:44:50.240" style="s2">necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.040" end="00:44:50.480" style="s2">living this what what is often portrayed</p>

<p begin="00:44:50.480" end="00:44:54.000" style="s2">as this this sort of um golden past</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.359" end="00:44:57.280" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.000" end="00:44:59.040" style="s2">everything was was fine but but they</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.280" end="00:45:01.359" style="s2">even if they were competing tribe</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.040" end="00:45:04.960" style="s2">against tribe um</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.359" end="00:45:08.240" style="s2">the common</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.960" end="00:45:11.040" style="s2">understanding that</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.240" end="00:45:12.960" style="s2">they were in our modern language</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.040" end="00:45:15.440" style="s2">emerging properties of the land</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.960" end="00:45:17.119" style="s2">that um they walked on that that they</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.440" end="00:45:18.240" style="s2">belonged to the land rather than the</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.119" end="00:45:21.920" style="s2">land belonging to them</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.240" end="00:45:25.280" style="s2">that ultimately um</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.920" end="00:45:27.440" style="s2">as they were doing their hunter-gatherer</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.280" end="00:45:29.359" style="s2">migrations in a certain regions that</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.440" end="00:45:30.839" style="s2">they that today we would maybe call</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.359" end="00:45:34.079" style="s2">their territory</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.839" end="00:45:36.880" style="s2">um they were stewards</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.079" end="00:45:38.560" style="s2">of the biological processes their myths</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.880" end="00:45:40.480" style="s2">and storytelling</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.560" end="00:45:42.240" style="s2">and their dances all their practices</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.480" end="00:45:43.440" style="s2">were ways of communicating to the next</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.240" end="00:45:46.640" style="s2">generation</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.440" end="00:45:48.400" style="s2">um where not to go in certain times of</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.640" end="00:45:51.520" style="s2">the breeding season in order to</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.400" end="00:45:52.319" style="s2">get to keep that species um able to</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.520" end="00:45:54.400" style="s2">reproduce</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.319" end="00:45:56.720" style="s2">they might have closed the clothes that</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.400" end="00:45:58.319" style="s2">in the spirits are there doing whatever</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.720" end="00:45:59.119" style="s2">and so you don&#39;t go there because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.319" end="00:46:02.400" style="s2">taboo</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.119" end="00:46:04.720" style="s2">um but if we do the research</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.400" end="00:46:06.560" style="s2">yeah so the point i&#39;d make is no they</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.720" end="00:46:10.160" style="s2">didn&#39;t clothe it</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.560" end="00:46:12.640" style="s2">in taboos and so on</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.160" end="00:46:14.640" style="s2">they believe the taboos and they pass</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.640" end="00:46:18.560" style="s2">the taboos on</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.640" end="00:46:21.599" style="s2">uh and the tribes that had taboos</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.560" end="00:46:22.800" style="s2">that were produced harmony with their</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.599" end="00:46:26.240" style="s2">environment</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.800" end="00:46:27.040" style="s2">those tribes persisted so the key point</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.240" end="00:46:28.640" style="s2">here is</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.040" end="00:46:30.160" style="s2">a very important distinction in</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.640" end="00:46:32.640" style="s2">knowledge is between</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.160" end="00:46:33.599" style="s2">procedural knowledge and declarative</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.640" end="00:46:35.599" style="s2">knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.599" end="00:46:37.520" style="s2">and procedural knowledge is the</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.599" end="00:46:40.800" style="s2">knowledge you have about</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.520" end="00:46:42.319" style="s2">when you ride a bicycle</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.800" end="00:46:44.800" style="s2">and people basically don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.319" end="00:46:46.319" style="s2">they&#39;re doing when they ride a bicycle</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.800" end="00:46:48.319" style="s2">but they do it and it works and the</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.319" end="00:46:51.200" style="s2">bicycle off they go</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.319" end="00:46:53.040" style="s2">swimming um people don&#39;t know what it is</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.200" end="00:46:54.480" style="s2">that enables them to actually swim when</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.040" end="00:46:56.480" style="s2">they learn how to swim</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.480" end="00:46:57.920" style="s2">that&#39;s it&#39;s procedural knowledge that</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.480" end="00:46:59.599" style="s2">they&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.920" end="00:47:01.280" style="s2">it&#39;s not declarative knowledge so</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.599" end="00:47:04.400" style="s2">declarative knowledge is when</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.280" end="00:47:07.599" style="s2">when you can put into words a model</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.400" end="00:47:10.640" style="s2">of what riding a bike involves</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.599" end="00:47:12.960" style="s2">and interestingly enough most physical</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.640" end="00:47:15.280" style="s2">activities are so complex</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.960" end="00:47:16.880" style="s2">that procedure we&#39;re not very good at</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.280" end="00:47:19.760" style="s2">putting into procedural knowledge but</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.880" end="00:47:23.440" style="s2">but the emergence of sports science</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.760" end="00:47:25.200" style="s2">is the emergence of the translation of</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.440" end="00:47:26.640" style="s2">procedural knowledge into declarative</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.200" end="00:47:30.079" style="s2">knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.640" end="00:47:31.520" style="s2">so the the tribes had procedural</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.079" end="00:47:33.599" style="s2">knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.520" end="00:47:35.040" style="s2">they you couldn&#39;t sit down with a tribal</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.599" end="00:47:36.000" style="s2">member and say you know what is it that</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.040" end="00:47:39.280" style="s2">you do</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.000" end="00:47:41.200" style="s2">um that ensures that you have</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.280" end="00:47:42.319" style="s2">uh sustainable relationships with your</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.200" end="00:47:43.760" style="s2">environment</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.319" end="00:47:45.680" style="s2">they wouldn&#39;t that language would mean</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.760" end="00:47:47.599" style="s2">absolutely not those concepts would mean</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.680" end="00:47:49.520" style="s2">absolutely nothing to them</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.599" end="00:47:51.520" style="s2">what they would say is is that oh well</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.520" end="00:47:53.440" style="s2">we um you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.520" end="00:47:55.119" style="s2">we believe that in you know if event a</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.440" end="00:47:57.280" style="s2">occurs that&#39;s because we&#39;ve angered some</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.119" end="00:47:58.880" style="s2">god over here and that causes</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.280" end="00:48:00.800" style="s2">to do something else and blah blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.880" end="00:48:03.040" style="s2">blah</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.800" end="00:48:05.200" style="s2">and us coming along with our procedural</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.040" end="00:48:07.119" style="s2">knowledge and our science could say oh</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.200" end="00:48:08.880" style="s2">if you look at how all that adds up that</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.119" end="00:48:10.800" style="s2">ensures that they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.880" end="00:48:12.319" style="s2">um over exploit you know particular</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.800" end="00:48:16.079" style="s2">resources</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.319" end="00:48:19.040" style="s2">um so and this you know as i said</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.079" end="00:48:20.800" style="s2">my ideas are you know clash with</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.040" end="00:48:23.680" style="s2">post-modernist thought</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.800" end="00:48:24.640" style="s2">and green and sphero dynamics thought uh</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.680" end="00:48:26.160" style="s2">because they want to</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.640" end="00:48:27.920" style="s2">you know hold up indigenous people has</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.160" end="00:48:30.800" style="s2">been able to teach us a lot</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.920" end="00:48:32.079" style="s2">no teaching is declarative knowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.800" end="00:48:32.640" style="s2">they don&#39;t have the declarative</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.079" end="00:48:35.119" style="s2">knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.640" end="00:48:35.920" style="s2">they have the procedural knowledge the</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.119" end="00:48:39.839" style="s2">best</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.920" end="00:48:43.040" style="s2">books that i&#39;ve that make this clear</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.839" end="00:48:44.800" style="s2">is one of the the few anthropologists</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.040" end="00:48:47.520" style="s2">who was also a</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.800" end="00:48:49.520" style="s2">cybernetician and a systems thinker and</p>

<p begin="00:49:28.160" end="00:49:31.839" style="s2">anyway the the guy i did is a guy called</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.480" end="00:49:35.200" style="s2">rapper paw</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.839" end="00:49:37.359" style="s2">um and uh and he i think his first book</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.200" end="00:49:40.559" style="s2">was pigs for ancestors</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.359" end="00:49:44.400" style="s2">and there he traces through</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.559" end="00:49:48.079" style="s2">these rituals and um uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.400" end="00:49:50.319" style="s2">processes involving pigs um</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.079" end="00:49:51.920" style="s2">that in certain circumstances and only</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.319" end="00:49:53.680" style="s2">those circumstances where they actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.920" end="00:49:57.040" style="s2">slaughter pigs and so on</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.680" end="00:49:59.599" style="s2">and he shows how wise</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.040" end="00:50:01.440" style="s2">the effects of those were but how none</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.599" end="00:50:03.839" style="s2">of the participants none of the tribal</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.440" end="00:50:06.079" style="s2">members in these new guinea tribes</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.839" end="00:50:07.680" style="s2">um you know understood it as wise action</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.079" end="00:50:09.680" style="s2">they unders they</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.680" end="00:50:13.040" style="s2">it was because of you know myths and</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.680" end="00:50:15.520" style="s2">beliefs and taboos</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.040" end="00:50:18.240" style="s2">but isn&#39;t that maybe precisely the less</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.520" end="00:50:18.240" style="s2">like like i mean</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.599" end="00:50:23.680" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s my own tinge of of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.160" end="00:50:26.079" style="s2">green meme speaking here but i</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.680" end="00:50:26.880" style="s2">i i sense that there is a both and that</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.079" end="00:50:30.880" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.880" end="00:50:34.400" style="s2">in terms of um it&#39;s not a going back</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.880" end="00:50:34.960" style="s2">to indigenous wisdom and saying oh now</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.400" end="00:50:36.720" style="s2">we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.960" end="00:50:39.200" style="s2">we&#39;ve got it wrong with modernity we</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.720" end="00:50:39.680" style="s2">should now put our tools down and and</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.200" end="00:50:42.960" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.680" end="00:50:44.640" style="s2">humbly say we&#39;re stupid and go to um the</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.960" end="00:50:46.559" style="s2">remaining</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.640" end="00:50:47.839" style="s2">ancestral wisdom keepers on the on the</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.559" end="00:50:50.880" style="s2">planet and say</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.839" end="00:50:52.800" style="s2">teachers and tell us um a</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.880" end="00:50:55.680" style="s2">my question there is how many of them</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.800" end="00:50:56.960" style="s2">are truly unadulterated wisdom carriers</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.680" end="00:50:58.880" style="s2">of the ancients</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.960" end="00:51:00.079" style="s2">or the ancestral knowledge and to what</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.880" end="00:51:03.680" style="s2">extent have they all</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.079" end="00:51:05.760" style="s2">been also affected by modernity to</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.680" end="00:51:08.000" style="s2">to the point that they&#39;re not really</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.760" end="00:51:09.440" style="s2">speaking from that yeah i&#39;m saying that</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.000" end="00:51:11.359" style="s2">i&#39;m saying that&#39;s that&#39;s not the big</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.440" end="00:51:13.200" style="s2">problem the big problem is</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.359" end="00:51:16.640" style="s2">the is that the wisdom was never in</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.200" end="00:51:18.000" style="s2">declarative knowledge yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.640" end="00:51:20.400" style="s2">but you keep going yeah because i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.000" end="00:51:23.280" style="s2">interested my question there</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.400" end="00:51:23.599" style="s2">is it&#39;s just what you were just speaking</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.280" end="00:51:26.720" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.599" end="00:51:30.000" style="s2">that example that rappapo tells about um</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.720" end="00:51:31.680" style="s2">that particular tribe um is similar to</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.000" end="00:51:32.720" style="s2">what you were saying is how how do we</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.680" end="00:51:36.400" style="s2">create</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.720" end="00:51:38.640" style="s2">without having to get everybody up to um</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.400" end="00:51:40.319" style="s2">why can&#39;t you think like gregory bateson</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.640" end="00:51:41.599" style="s2">and we all should and then we would be a</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.319" end="00:51:44.960" style="s2">wiser species</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.599" end="00:51:47.680" style="s2">um creating frameworks</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.960" end="00:51:48.400" style="s2">that allow for that consequence capture</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.680" end="00:51:52.480" style="s2">to actually be</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.400" end="00:51:54.960" style="s2">inbuilt into our human societies</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.480" end="00:51:55.680" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s that&#39;s the challenge so</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.960" end="00:51:58.319" style="s2">so just</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.680" end="00:52:00.240" style="s2">to continue along with the bad news the</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.319" end="00:52:04.000" style="s2">really bad news that</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.240" end="00:52:05.680" style="s2">um but bad news is</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.000" end="00:52:07.760" style="s2">in my view essential to understand if</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.680" end="00:52:10.640" style="s2">we&#39;re to move the other side of it</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.760" end="00:52:11.520" style="s2">so the future will not involve a return</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.640" end="00:52:13.200" style="s2">to the past</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.520" end="00:52:14.640" style="s2">it&#39;ll be going through the bad news to</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.200" end="00:52:17.119" style="s2">the other side</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.640" end="00:52:17.760" style="s2">through hierarchy it&#39;ll be and through</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.119" end="00:52:20.240" style="s2">markets</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.760" end="00:52:21.680" style="s2">so markets will be very important but</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.240" end="00:52:23.599" style="s2">they won&#39;t be like our current markets</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.680" end="00:52:25.839" style="s2">and hierarchy will be very important</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.599" end="00:52:27.119" style="s2">but anyway coming to this so the new</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.839" end="00:52:29.839" style="s2">guinea tribes and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.119" end="00:52:31.440" style="s2">a fantastic laboratory that&#39;s why you</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.839" end="00:52:32.800" style="s2">know margaret mead and gregory bateson</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.440" end="00:52:34.480" style="s2">and these guys</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.800" end="00:52:37.119" style="s2">jared diamond and someone cut their</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.480" end="00:52:40.000" style="s2">teeth as anthropologists</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.119" end="00:52:40.559" style="s2">in new guinea tribes because there are</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.000" end="00:52:42.319" style="s2">there are</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.559" end="00:52:44.400" style="s2">you know there are thousands upon</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.319" end="00:52:45.440" style="s2">thousands of them a great population of</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.400" end="00:52:48.160" style="s2">tribes</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.440" end="00:52:49.119" style="s2">and the and hidden and separated by</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.160" end="00:52:50.160" style="s2">valleys</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.119" end="00:52:52.800" style="s2">and therefore they&#39;re wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.160" end="00:52:55.440" style="s2">experiments for watching in effect</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.800" end="00:52:57.839" style="s2">the processes of mutation you know like</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.440" end="00:53:00.480" style="s2">new taboos arising new</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.839" end="00:53:01.839" style="s2">myths arising and so on and seen how</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.480" end="00:53:04.480" style="s2">they were selected</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.839" end="00:53:06.240" style="s2">you know by the environment and produced</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.480" end="00:53:09.040" style="s2">this procedural knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.240" end="00:53:10.880" style="s2">that isn&#39;t declarative knowledge so it</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.040" end="00:53:13.359" style="s2">was in effect natural selection large</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.880" end="00:53:15.280" style="s2">populations competing and so on</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.359" end="00:53:17.520" style="s2">but throughout the whole evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.280" end="00:53:21.040" style="s2">evolutionary history of life on earth</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.520" end="00:53:24.480" style="s2">that&#39;s driven this spreading</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.040" end="00:53:27.119" style="s2">widening of of cooperation on increasing</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.480" end="00:53:27.920" style="s2">increasing higher scale but when you get</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.119" end="00:53:31.119" style="s2">to the</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.920" end="00:53:32.319" style="s2">situation where you&#39;ve got uh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.119" end="00:53:36.559" style="s2">increased on scale</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.319" end="00:53:38.480" style="s2">so much that you only have 200 of these</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.559" end="00:53:40.079" style="s2">cooperative entities to cover the whole</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.480" end="00:53:42.160" style="s2">planet</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.079" end="00:53:43.680" style="s2">uh then that mechanism of that</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.160" end="00:53:45.200" style="s2">automatically</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.680" end="00:53:47.280" style="s2">without declarative knowledge without</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.200" end="00:53:48.920" style="s2">insight without intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.280" end="00:53:50.480" style="s2">produced behavior that was</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.920" end="00:53:53.520" style="s2">extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.480" end="00:53:54.880" style="s2">intelligent extraordinarily systemically</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.520" end="00:53:57.680" style="s2">intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.880" end="00:53:58.480" style="s2">like all these processes in your body</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.680" end="00:54:01.119" style="s2">that digest</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.480" end="00:54:01.839" style="s2">food moves stuff around your body and</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.119" end="00:54:04.160" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.839" end="00:54:05.760" style="s2">the human mind is totally incapable of</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.160" end="00:54:07.760" style="s2">understanding</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.760" end="00:54:09.040" style="s2">how that happens it&#39;s just a fantasy to</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.760" end="00:54:10.160" style="s2">think that we are anywhere near</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.040" end="00:54:12.480" style="s2">understanding</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.160" end="00:54:13.359" style="s2">all that was produced by trial and error</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.480" end="00:54:16.400" style="s2">and selection</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.359" end="00:54:17.599" style="s2">all produced by automatic evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.400" end="00:54:22.079" style="s2">processes</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.599" end="00:54:25.200" style="s2">so um this is what it amounts to</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.079" end="00:54:26.400" style="s2">evolution on a planet and similar things</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.200" end="00:54:28.000" style="s2">happen on</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.400" end="00:54:30.720" style="s2">you know billions of planets i can</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.000" end="00:54:30.720" style="s2">guarantee it</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.880" end="00:54:35.119" style="s2">um evolution on a planet proceeds up to</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.160" end="00:54:38.280" style="s2">a certain point</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.119" end="00:54:41.359" style="s2">unconsciously through selection</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.280" end="00:54:44.559" style="s2">experimentation and so on then when it</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.359" end="00:54:46.880" style="s2">gets to the stage we&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.559" end="00:54:48.480" style="s2">the processes that drove it</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.880" end="00:54:51.839" style="s2">unconsciously</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.480" end="00:54:54.240" style="s2">fail and the only way it can proceed</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.839" end="00:54:57.440" style="s2">from here on in</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.240" end="00:54:59.680" style="s2">uh is consciously</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.440" end="00:55:01.440" style="s2">intentionally through declarative</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.680" end="00:55:05.760" style="s2">knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.440" end="00:55:08.079" style="s2">so that&#39;s that&#39;s really bad news</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.760" end="00:55:10.160" style="s2">the good news is that it means that</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.079" end="00:55:11.119" style="s2">humanity has enormous work to do on this</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.160" end="00:55:14.400" style="s2">planet</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.119" end="00:55:17.040" style="s2">it means individuals you know once you</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.400" end="00:55:20.160" style="s2">see this bigger game</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.040" end="00:55:22.000" style="s2">that you&#39;re embedded in uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.160" end="00:55:24.240" style="s2">and a human life&#39;s like this you you</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.000" end="00:55:25.200" style="s2">start off in a family game</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.240" end="00:55:28.240" style="s2">you know where you&#39;re a member of a</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.200" end="00:55:29.839" style="s2">little family and then you go to school</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.240" end="00:55:32.240" style="s2">and you&#39;re in the school game and then</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.839" end="00:55:36.079" style="s2">you graduate and so on and</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.240" end="00:55:38.400" style="s2">you&#39;re entering wider scale systems</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.079" end="00:55:39.839" style="s2">uh and unless you commit suicide to</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.400" end="00:55:43.040" style="s2">those</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.839" end="00:55:45.280" style="s2">you know the future potentials you</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.040" end="00:55:46.319" style="s2">you realize you&#39;re in a wider game and a</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.280" end="00:55:48.000" style="s2">wider game and you</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.319" end="00:55:49.440" style="s2">join in that game positively and you</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.000" end="00:55:51.280" style="s2">make a contribution</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.440" end="00:55:52.559" style="s2">to it and while you believe in that game</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.280" end="00:55:56.559" style="s2">you it gives you</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.559" end="00:55:58.240" style="s2">meaning and purpose in your life well</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.559" end="00:56:01.839" style="s2">the biggest game we&#39;re in the greatest</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.240" end="00:56:04.240" style="s2">game of all the evolutionary game</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.839" end="00:56:05.760" style="s2">and we&#39;re so lucky that there&#39;s a role</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.240" end="00:56:07.839" style="s2">for us</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.760" end="00:56:09.200" style="s2">in that game an intentional role we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.839" end="00:56:10.960" style="s2">not like</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.200" end="00:56:13.599" style="s2">you know the the process that&#39;s led up</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.960" end="00:56:16.640" style="s2">to now where it all happens blindly</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.599" end="00:56:18.480" style="s2">through trial and error and selection we</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.640" end="00:56:21.680" style="s2">actually have to</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.480" end="00:56:23.440" style="s2">our role is to to understand where it</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.680" end="00:56:26.559" style="s2">needs to go</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.440" end="00:56:28.240" style="s2">which is global consequence capture</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.559" end="00:56:30.880" style="s2">until you have global consequence</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.240" end="00:56:33.280" style="s2">capture you have global warming</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.880" end="00:56:34.640" style="s2">global environmental degradation the</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.280" end="00:56:36.640" style="s2">threat of nuclear war</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.640" end="00:56:38.000" style="s2">which is the threat of nuclear war is</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.640" end="00:56:41.119" style="s2">extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.000" end="00:56:44.400" style="s2">i mean pakistan and india have</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.119" end="00:56:46.000" style="s2">nuclear weapons donald trump and i hate</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.400" end="00:56:47.839" style="s2">to be disparaging about red-headed</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.000" end="00:56:51.920" style="s2">people but</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.839" end="00:56:56.880" style="s2">he&#39;s not he&#39;s everything about him</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.920" end="00:57:00.079" style="s2">category he&#39;s a fake redhead</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.880" end="00:57:01.119" style="s2">but but he has yeah he has new nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.079" end="00:57:04.319" style="s2">weapons</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.119" end="00:57:06.559" style="s2">so there again something that</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.319" end="00:57:07.599" style="s2">no individual nation state can insulate</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.559" end="00:57:10.079" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.599" end="00:57:11.520" style="s2">against other countries handling of</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.079" end="00:57:13.760" style="s2">nuclear weapons</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.520" end="00:57:16.319" style="s2">no individual nation state can insulate</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.760" end="00:57:19.200" style="s2">itself unilaterally against</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.319" end="00:57:20.400" style="s2">the production of global environmental</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.200" end="00:57:22.880" style="s2">degradation</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.400" end="00:57:23.520" style="s2">from carbon dioxide emissions or many</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.880" end="00:57:26.880" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.520" end="00:57:28.960" style="s2">actions of other nation states</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.880" end="00:57:30.799" style="s2">only a global system can implement</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.960" end="00:57:33.839" style="s2">consequence capture</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.799" end="00:57:35.359" style="s2">um and of course then</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.839" end="00:57:37.760" style="s2">so the question is how do you introduce</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.359" end="00:57:40.480" style="s2">how do you this magical</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.760" end="00:57:41.520" style="s2">process of consequence capture that</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.480" end="00:57:43.280" style="s2">results in</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.520" end="00:57:45.200" style="s2">individual entities not having any</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.280" end="00:57:47.200" style="s2">concern for the whole</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.200" end="00:57:48.960" style="s2">but finding that when they when they</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.200" end="00:57:51.599" style="s2">pursue their own little individual</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.960" end="00:57:52.880" style="s2">interests it benefits it&#39;s all aligned</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.599" end="00:57:54.000" style="s2">with the interests of the hull that</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.880" end="00:57:56.319" style="s2">benefits the whole</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.000" end="00:57:57.920" style="s2">how do you introduce this magical</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.319" end="00:57:59.839" style="s2">consequence capture</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.920" end="00:58:02.160" style="s2">and that&#39;s very bad news for the green</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.839" end="00:58:02.160" style="s2">meme</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.040" end="00:58:07.760" style="s2">because it&#39;s all done by power and</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.079" end="00:58:11.680" style="s2">hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.760" end="00:58:13.839" style="s2">so this this is where we autopolisis</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.680" end="00:58:16.559" style="s2">isn&#39;t enough so</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.839" end="00:58:18.240" style="s2">returning to the uh autocatalytic set</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.559" end="00:58:21.839" style="s2">the autopoetic</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.240" end="00:58:24.240" style="s2">system of of proteins</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.839" end="00:58:25.760" style="s2">you know to take the simple one and i</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.240" end="00:58:28.400" style="s2">it&#39;s a network not a</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.760" end="00:58:29.839" style="s2">a circle but the reason why i describe</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.400" end="00:58:30.880" style="s2">it as a circle</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.839" end="00:58:33.119" style="s2">is because that&#39;s the only way</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.880" end="00:58:33.760" style="s2">declarative knowledge can transmit it</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.119" end="00:58:38.640" style="s2">between us</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.760" end="00:58:42.720" style="s2">easily um so the circle abcda</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.640" end="00:58:46.240" style="s2">um you know pumps itself up</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.720" end="00:58:50.079" style="s2">uh is autopoetic it can it</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.240" end="00:58:51.839" style="s2">produces itself through time</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.079" end="00:58:54.079" style="s2">but it&#39;s not life because it&#39;s not very</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.839" end="00:58:56.240" style="s2">evolvable at all so</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.079" end="00:58:58.640" style="s2">so for to explore the possibilities of</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.240" end="00:59:01.839" style="s2">cooperative organization</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.640" end="00:59:05.119" style="s2">then any uh</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.839" end="00:59:09.680" style="s2">catalyst that can contribute</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.119" end="00:59:12.960" style="s2">to the uh to the little auto poetic part</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.680" end="00:59:14.640" style="s2">uh has to be integratable into that</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.960" end="00:59:18.160" style="s2">organization</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.640" end="00:59:20.559" style="s2">so if uh hg</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.160" end="00:59:22.160" style="s2">zed you know happened to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.559" end="00:59:23.760" style="s2">really give the</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.160" end="00:59:25.839" style="s2">the system a boost but they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.760" end="00:59:28.640" style="s2">catalyzed by any</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.839" end="00:59:30.000" style="s2">any member of that uh existing auto</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.640" end="00:59:33.200" style="s2">catalytic system</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.000" end="00:59:37.280" style="s2">then that boost can never be realized</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.200" end="00:59:39.280" style="s2">um and just to make a leap uh</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.280" end="00:59:41.520" style="s2">just briefly because that to me speaks</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.280" end="00:59:42.799" style="s2">exactly to the the the bit that i&#39;m so</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.520" end="00:59:46.799" style="s2">searching for which is</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.799" end="00:59:49.839" style="s2">the um not coming</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.799" end="00:59:52.960" style="s2">from the division</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.839" end="00:59:55.760" style="s2">of life into</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.960" end="00:59:57.440" style="s2">individuals and species which clearly is</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.760" end="00:59:58.160" style="s2">one way of seeing and gives lots of</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.440" end="01:00:00.799" style="s2">insights</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.160" end="01:00:01.359" style="s2">but coming from the opposite coming from</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.799" end="01:00:04.640" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.359" end="01:00:05.119" style="s2">the allen rayner calls it inclusionality</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.640" end="01:00:08.240" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.119" end="01:00:12.960" style="s2">from from true um dynamic</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.240" end="01:00:16.640" style="s2">wholeness where all of it is actually</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.960" end="01:00:19.040" style="s2">a evolving um yeah</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.640" end="01:00:20.960" style="s2">unity might be like but i&#39;ll i&#39;ll get to</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.040" end="01:00:23.359" style="s2">that so</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.960" end="01:00:25.440" style="s2">shoot me if i don&#39;t you know sort of</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.359" end="01:00:26.640" style="s2">wave and accuse me of being a child and</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.440" end="01:00:28.000" style="s2">a fraud if i</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.640" end="01:00:30.559" style="s2">forget it so bring me back onto the</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.000" end="01:00:33.040" style="s2">track but but this builds to that so</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.559" end="01:00:34.400" style="s2">so you&#39;ve got the little autocoder</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.040" end="01:00:35.280" style="s2">catalytic cycle</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.400" end="01:00:37.359" style="s2">and there&#39;s a whole lot of</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.280" end="01:00:38.240" style="s2">potentialities that it can&#39;t integrate</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.359" end="01:00:39.680" style="s2">because there are all these other</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.240" end="01:00:40.880" style="s2">chemicals</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.680" end="01:00:43.520" style="s2">that could contribute to the</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.880" end="01:00:45.760" style="s2">functionality of that little cycle</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.520" end="01:00:47.680" style="s2">but can&#39;t be but can&#39;t because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.760" end="01:00:50.960" style="s2">not catalyzed</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.680" end="01:00:52.319" style="s2">um by the integratable into the cycle</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.960" end="01:00:54.319" style="s2">because they&#39;re not catalyzed</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.319" end="01:00:56.319" style="s2">so what was the solution so that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.319" end="01:00:57.040" style="s2">like the metabolism in the protocell</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.319" end="01:01:00.400" style="s2">let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.040" end="01:01:02.480" style="s2">that&#39;s like your cells without dna and</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.400" end="01:01:06.799" style="s2">rna</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.480" end="01:01:09.200" style="s2">pure autopilosis pure autocatalysis</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.799" end="01:01:10.640" style="s2">so what introduced consequence</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.200" end="01:01:11.599" style="s2">consequence captures when any other</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.640" end="01:01:14.160" style="s2">chemical</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.599" end="01:01:15.599" style="s2">that can benefit the whole captures the</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.160" end="01:01:17.839" style="s2">benefits of that so it does get</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.599" end="01:01:21.280" style="s2">supported</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.839" end="01:01:23.359" style="s2">anything that would harm the whole</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.280" end="01:01:24.799" style="s2">consequence capture means it gets</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.359" end="01:01:27.119" style="s2">punished for</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.799" end="01:01:28.640" style="s2">say a free rider that extracts benefit</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.119" end="01:01:30.799" style="s2">from the cycle</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.640" end="01:01:33.200" style="s2">but gives nothing in return consequence</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.799" end="01:01:34.880" style="s2">capture means it&#39;s harmed by doing that</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.200" end="01:01:37.119" style="s2">so what introduces that consequence</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.880" end="01:01:39.359" style="s2">capture and the answer is</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.119" end="01:01:41.200" style="s2">you you know at the beginning of life</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.359" end="01:01:44.720" style="s2">you had the autopoetic</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.200" end="01:01:44.720" style="s2">system of um</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.119" end="01:01:52.000" style="s2">catalytic proteins rna came along</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.720" end="01:01:54.960" style="s2">rna was the governor of the cell</p>

<p begin="01:02:36.400" end="01:02:42.480" style="s2">then you so that&#39;s that&#39;s the prokaryote</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.839" end="01:02:44.240" style="s2">then the story of you know the that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.480" end="01:02:47.760" style="s2">really fascinating to me the</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.240" end="01:02:49.280" style="s2">the metaphors used uh in biology are</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.760" end="01:02:50.799" style="s2">clearly a result of people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.280" end="01:02:52.400" style="s2">developmental levels and where they are</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.799" end="01:02:56.799" style="s2">in the spiral</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.400" end="01:02:59.200" style="s2">so the best thinkers in biology um</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.799" end="01:03:01.280" style="s2">uh are generally the ones who are common</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.200" end="01:03:02.799" style="s2">not not the real system series but the</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.280" end="01:03:06.400" style="s2">the best thinkers</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.799" end="01:03:10.160" style="s2">you know are green and so they see it as</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.400" end="01:03:11.680" style="s2">collaboration as um the equal partners</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.160" end="01:03:13.039" style="s2">you know the prokaryotes getting</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.680" end="01:03:16.160" style="s2">together and</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.039" end="01:03:18.799" style="s2">and producing a whole no</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.160" end="01:03:20.079" style="s2">no what what happened was that the the</p>

<p begin="01:03:20.079" end="01:03:24.799" style="s2">who has the power it&#39;s its dna rna has</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.599" end="01:03:26.799" style="s2">the power over</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.799" end="01:03:28.480" style="s2">everything that goes on in that cell it</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.799" end="01:03:31.440" style="s2">introduces consequence capture</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.480" end="01:03:33.039" style="s2">the cell engulfs the little the small</p>

<p begin="01:03:33.039" end="01:03:42.559" style="s2">and then the rna dna the governor of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.280" end="01:03:42.559" style="s2">that cell then manipulates</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.440" end="01:03:47.839" style="s2">that bacteria that became mitochondria</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.480" end="01:03:50.559" style="s2">in its own interests</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.839" end="01:03:51.920" style="s2">it enslaves it it introduces consequence</p>

<p begin="01:03:51.920" end="01:03:55.440" style="s2">so when so the mitochondria the</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.559" end="01:03:59.200" style="s2">internalized</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.440" end="01:04:01.039" style="s2">small bacteria still do what</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.200" end="01:04:03.920" style="s2">you know still pursue their own</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.039" end="01:04:06.079" style="s2">interests but you&#39;ve got this</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.920" end="01:04:09.280" style="s2">consequence capture implemented by the</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.079" end="01:04:11.039" style="s2">the rna dna the genetic apparatus</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.280" end="01:04:12.559" style="s2">that ensures that the only way it can</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.039" end="01:04:15.839" style="s2">pursue its interests is if it</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.559" end="01:04:19.200" style="s2">if as if it serves the whole and</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.839" end="01:04:22.960" style="s2">so it is each of these steps so it</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.200" end="01:04:24.480" style="s2">so but isn&#39;t it i mean i i hear you and</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.960" end="01:04:27.839" style="s2">i agree with you</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.480" end="01:04:30.160" style="s2">kind of somehow the the enslaving bit</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.839" end="01:04:31.839" style="s2">um was maybe a strong metaphor that that</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.160" end="01:04:35.520" style="s2">i&#39;m not quite sure whether</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.839" end="01:04:38.960" style="s2">i would um on the right because</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.520" end="01:04:41.280" style="s2">because it isn&#39;t it goes both ways um</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.960" end="01:04:42.480" style="s2">like it the mitochondria actually needs</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.280" end="01:04:45.440" style="s2">the context</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.480" end="01:04:46.319" style="s2">of that larger cell in order to um</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.440" end="01:04:50.240" style="s2">continue</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.319" end="01:04:52.079" style="s2">as a mitochondria so so um</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.240" end="01:04:53.680" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a mutualism rather than an</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.079" end="01:04:55.839" style="s2">enslavement to some extent well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.680" end="01:04:57.760" style="s2">well that&#39;s what that&#39;s what certain</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.839" end="01:04:59.280" style="s2">yeah most biologists</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.760" end="01:05:02.799" style="s2">the bigger picture ones you know the</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.280" end="01:05:05.839" style="s2">green ones because the mechanical ones</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.799" end="01:05:06.960" style="s2">you know don&#39;t have this no but the the</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.839" end="01:05:10.880" style="s2">bigger picture ones</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.960" end="01:05:12.720" style="s2">uh they see it as yeah mutualism</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.880" end="01:05:14.079" style="s2">um but there is clearly a power</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.720" end="01:05:16.799" style="s2">relationship there</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.079" end="01:05:17.680" style="s2">yeah i mean that i did one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.799" end="01:05:19.680" style="s2">that i found</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.680" end="01:05:22.000" style="s2">very useful because you bring in spiral</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.680" end="01:05:25.039" style="s2">dynamics in that framing with the green</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.000" end="01:05:28.400" style="s2">meme regularly is</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.039" end="01:05:30.079" style="s2">one of the issues that that ken wilbur</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.400" end="01:05:31.839" style="s2">kind of identified of like the</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.079" end="01:05:33.359" style="s2">hierarchy being such a trigger for</p>

<p begin="01:05:41.119" end="01:05:45.200" style="s2">hierarchies is is very important there</p>

<p begin="01:05:45.200" end="01:05:48.559" style="s2">you need that structure of hierarchical</p>

<p begin="01:05:48.559" end="01:05:53.039" style="s2">but they they can actually be enabling</p>

<p begin="01:05:53.039" end="01:05:56.079" style="s2">the the top dominates the bottom which</p>

<p begin="01:05:56.079" end="01:05:59.680" style="s2">my understanding that&#39;s right so so a</p>

<p begin="01:06:15.200" end="01:06:20.960" style="s2">farms the uh the auto catalytic set of</p>

<p begin="01:08:31.279" end="01:08:35.279" style="s2">that&#39;s right at the lower level so so it</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.080" end="01:08:38.719" style="s2">they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.279" end="01:08:41.520" style="s2">all powerful they they&#39;re only there</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.719" end="01:08:42.400" style="s2">as as long as what they&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.520" end="01:08:44.480" style="s2">enabling</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.400" end="01:08:45.440" style="s2">the whole to continue to grow grow and</p>

<p begin="01:08:45.440" end="01:08:48.640" style="s2">and that&#39;s where in in my framing it</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.759" end="01:08:50.480" style="s2">it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.640" end="01:08:52.560" style="s2">and and i feel like that&#39;s where we can</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.480" end="01:08:55.279" style="s2">make peace with the green meme</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.560" end="01:08:56.000" style="s2">um in a in a kind of healthy expression</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.279" end="01:08:58.159" style="s2">of meme and</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.000" end="01:08:59.279" style="s2">uh the green meme and move beyond it</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.159" end="01:09:02.319" style="s2">yeah is is</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.279" end="01:09:04.880" style="s2">um to to just be sensitive around</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.319" end="01:09:06.640" style="s2">the language use and and see them more</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.880" end="01:09:09.359" style="s2">as enablers rather than</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.640" end="01:09:11.120" style="s2">dominators even if they have a certain</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.359" end="01:09:13.199" style="s2">power over</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.120" end="01:09:14.239" style="s2">yeah they will well they do have power</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.199" end="01:09:16.719" style="s2">over</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.239" end="01:09:17.600" style="s2">so that&#39;s and that&#39;s an essential part</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.719" end="01:09:20.719" style="s2">of it so</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.600" end="01:09:22.239" style="s2">so if if in translating it into dealing</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.719" end="01:09:24.640" style="s2">with green people</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.239" end="01:09:27.279" style="s2">um you know you lose sight of the fact</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.640" end="01:09:29.600" style="s2">that there is a power relationship</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.279" end="01:09:31.440" style="s2">then you lose sight of an element that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.600" end="01:09:35.839" style="s2">absolutely essential</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.440" end="01:09:35.839" style="s2">so to introduce consequence capture</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.080" end="01:09:43.279" style="s2">in the on the planet you need</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.839" end="01:09:45.199" style="s2">global governance that is powerful but</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.279" end="01:09:47.759" style="s2">in the absence of competition between</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.199" end="01:09:50.000" style="s2">you know all these global</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.759" end="01:09:52.400" style="s2">systems competing and therefore being</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.000" end="01:09:55.360" style="s2">disciplined by the need to be effective</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.400" end="01:09:56.640" style="s2">and not be exploitative and you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.360" end="01:09:59.280" style="s2">global governance that</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.640" end="01:10:02.400" style="s2">that is exploitative will produce a far</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.280" end="01:10:02.960" style="s2">less effective super organism than one</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.400" end="01:10:05.280" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.960" end="01:10:06.480" style="s2">which governs and promotes cooperation</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.280" end="01:10:08.400" style="s2">and so on</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.480" end="01:10:10.480" style="s2">but but if but if it if you leave out</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.400" end="01:10:11.040" style="s2">the the element of power then it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.480" end="01:10:14.000" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.040" end="01:10:15.679" style="s2">it all becomes uh you can&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.000" end="01:10:17.679" style="s2">consequence capture</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.679" end="01:10:20.080" style="s2">you is you need power you need</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.679" end="01:10:22.320" style="s2">constraint but then what you do</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.080" end="01:10:24.880" style="s2">is you need to constrain in the absence</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.320" end="01:10:28.000" style="s2">of competition to constrain the</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.880" end="01:10:30.000" style="s2">you know the governance um you need</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.000" end="01:10:31.440" style="s2">you need systems to then constrain that</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.000" end="01:10:34.239" style="s2">governance</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.440" end="01:10:36.800" style="s2">so arguably uh if you look at the</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.239" end="01:10:39.520" style="s2">history of human societies</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.800" end="01:10:41.360" style="s2">a key evolutionary event in the</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.520" end="01:10:45.280" style="s2">evolution of human societies was the</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.360" end="01:10:48.320" style="s2">magna carta</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.280" end="01:10:50.960" style="s2">and then then</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.320" end="01:10:54.080" style="s2">the introduction of democracy because</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.960" end="01:10:58.000" style="s2">the magna carta was a form of constraint</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.080" end="01:10:59.840" style="s2">on the king to make sure that the king</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.000" end="01:11:01.440" style="s2">governed in the interests of the whole</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.840" end="01:11:04.800" style="s2">or more so he</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.440" end="01:11:08.000" style="s2">is massively overblown um but</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.800" end="01:11:10.800" style="s2">but the story of the magna carta but</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.000" end="01:11:12.000" style="s2">in but it was a constraining of the king</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.800" end="01:11:15.679" style="s2">uh democracy</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.000" end="01:11:17.760" style="s2">is a is an attempt to constrain</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.679" end="01:11:19.920" style="s2">uh government so that it has to act in</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.760" end="01:11:24.000" style="s2">the interest of the whole</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.920" end="01:11:25.760" style="s2">so so when you lose natural selection</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.000" end="01:11:28.080" style="s2">and competition as a way of</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.760" end="01:11:30.080" style="s2">constraining the cooperatives you need</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.080" end="01:11:32.640" style="s2">the cooperatives to include mechanisms</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.080" end="01:11:35.520" style="s2">that constrain its governance</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.640" end="01:11:36.159" style="s2">to ensure that it&#39;s not abused but it</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.520" end="01:11:38.719" style="s2">still is</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.159" end="01:11:40.000" style="s2">it still is all about power and but when</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.719" end="01:11:42.159" style="s2">i listen to you like it it</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.000" end="01:11:43.760" style="s2">does to some extent i mean language use</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.159" end="01:11:46.800" style="s2">is slightly slightly</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.760" end="01:11:47.600" style="s2">different than than i fully resonate</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.800" end="01:11:50.960" style="s2">with but but</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.600" end="01:11:53.520" style="s2">what you&#39;re explaining is um very</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.960" end="01:11:54.000" style="s2">linked like for example earlier when you</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.520" end="01:11:55.760" style="s2">said that</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.000" end="01:11:57.760" style="s2">that in order to have consequences</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.760" end="01:12:00.400" style="s2">capture you need subsidiarity</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.760" end="01:12:00.800" style="s2">that is fully aligned with where where</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.400" end="01:12:02.719" style="s2">my</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.800" end="01:12:04.159" style="s2">and i&#39;m i&#39;m not saying i&#39;ve got anything</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.719" end="01:12:07.920" style="s2">i&#39;m just i&#39;m searching</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.159" end="01:12:08.880" style="s2">for yeah yes but but increasingly i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.920" end="01:12:12.080" style="s2">i&#39;m realizing if</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.880" end="01:12:13.760" style="s2">if on this planet we want to i call it</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.080" end="01:12:15.520" style="s2">redesign the human impact on</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.760" end="01:12:17.199" style="s2">on earth within the lifetime of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.520" end="01:12:20.320" style="s2">generations alive today</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.199" end="01:12:20.719" style="s2">um but being fully aware that design is</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.320" end="01:12:24.640" style="s2">never</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.719" end="01:12:26.960" style="s2">a kind of um fully</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.640" end="01:12:28.640" style="s2">prediction and control based type of</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.960" end="01:12:30.159" style="s2">design it doesn&#39;t like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.640" end="01:12:31.760" style="s2">dancing it&#39;s a dancing with the</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.159" end="01:12:35.760" style="s2">complexity um</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.760" end="01:12:39.040" style="s2">and and like brian goodwin was one of my</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.760" end="01:12:40.880" style="s2">mentors in understanding complexity</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.040" end="01:12:42.080" style="s2">said that with the insights from</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.880" end="01:12:45.440" style="s2">complexity</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.080" end="01:12:47.120" style="s2">the the the purpose of science of the</p>

<p begin="01:12:50.880" end="01:12:54.400" style="s2">to appropriate participation and and i</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.840" end="01:12:56.719" style="s2">find that</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.400" end="01:12:58.000" style="s2">that&#39;s very useful and if we if we want</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.719" end="01:13:00.000" style="s2">to create</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.000" end="01:13:02.080" style="s2">a global system that has this</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.000" end="01:13:04.640" style="s2">consequence capture built into it then</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.080" end="01:13:08.600" style="s2">we actually need to</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.640" end="01:13:11.199" style="s2">redesign governance to enable</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.600" end="01:13:12.080" style="s2">subsidiarity at the local and regional</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.199" end="01:13:16.000" style="s2">scale</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.080" end="01:13:16.000" style="s2">but we need to have a very clear</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.199" end="01:13:22.000" style="s2">system of disincentivization of any of</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.320" end="01:13:26.080" style="s2">the bioregions</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.000" end="01:13:28.960" style="s2">um like basically i think the healing</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.080" end="01:13:30.239" style="s2">of our relationship with the planet so</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.960" end="01:13:32.000" style="s2">we can continue</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.239" end="01:13:34.320" style="s2">as one of the species on this planet</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.000" end="01:13:38.239" style="s2">would would be we need to</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.320" end="01:13:39.360" style="s2">everywhere regenerate healthy ecosystems</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.239" end="01:13:41.840" style="s2">functions</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.360" end="01:13:42.640" style="s2">um we need to increase bioproductivity</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.840" end="01:13:45.120" style="s2">and heat heal</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.640" end="01:13:46.800" style="s2">heal the soils bring back the forests</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.120" end="01:13:50.000" style="s2">heal the water</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.800" end="01:13:54.080" style="s2">waterways both um marine</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.000" end="01:13:56.159" style="s2">and and freshwater systems and</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.080" end="01:13:58.320" style="s2">to my mind that can only be done at the</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.159" end="01:14:01.360" style="s2">local and bioregional scale</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.320" end="01:14:04.560" style="s2">and the global entity of coordination</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.360" end="01:14:06.400" style="s2">would be as long as you people in your</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.560" end="01:14:08.560" style="s2">region can demonstrate</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.400" end="01:14:10.719" style="s2">the regenerative impact on your</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.560" end="01:14:11.440" style="s2">bioregions you get the benefit of the</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.719" end="01:14:14.320" style="s2">global</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.440" end="01:14:16.880" style="s2">um system because we&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.320" end="01:14:18.719" style="s2">fall back into producing everything</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.880" end="01:14:20.400" style="s2">at the local level or the by regional</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.719" end="01:14:23.040" style="s2">level yeah um</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.400" end="01:14:24.320" style="s2">but but the minute you you fall out of</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.040" end="01:14:27.440" style="s2">that you you</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.320" end="01:14:30.640" style="s2">then then the the sort of</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.440" end="01:14:33.920" style="s2">um stick rather than the carrot is</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.640" end="01:14:36.880" style="s2">consonants yeah yeah yeah and you</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.920" end="01:14:39.199" style="s2">you both say you have a hierarchy of so</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.880" end="01:14:41.120" style="s2">i don&#39;t use the term dominator</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.199" end="01:14:42.560" style="s2">i&#39;m not that provocative so i call it</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.120" end="01:14:45.520" style="s2">just management</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.560" end="01:14:46.400" style="s2">and you know and you can have you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.520" end="01:14:48.320" style="s2">idiot</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.400" end="01:14:49.440" style="s2">mechanistic management or you can have</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.320" end="01:14:52.159" style="s2">extremely effective</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.440" end="01:14:53.199" style="s2">subtle management that hardly seems to</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.159" end="01:14:56.960" style="s2">be there</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.199" end="01:14:59.440" style="s2">you know like the the uh</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.960" end="01:15:00.719" style="s2">the chinese wisdom tradition says that</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.440" end="01:15:03.360" style="s2">the way to govern a country</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.719" end="01:15:04.960" style="s2">is the same way you cook a fish you cook</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.360" end="01:15:09.199" style="s2">it lightly</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.960" end="01:15:11.600" style="s2">um and the uh as if it&#39;s not there</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.199" end="01:15:13.120" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s you know so there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.600" end="01:15:15.120" style="s2">of wisdom in how to actually govern and</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.120" end="01:15:16.800" style="s2">how to introduce consequence capture</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.120" end="01:15:18.800" style="s2">but but broadly speaking there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.800" end="01:15:22.480" style="s2">hierarchy of governance</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.800" end="01:15:24.719" style="s2">uh and the and consequence capture is</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.480" end="01:15:26.480" style="s2">uh kept to the lowest level that is</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.719" end="01:15:29.840" style="s2">where it&#39;s effective</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.480" end="01:15:33.679" style="s2">um and every level of power</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.840" end="01:15:36.320" style="s2">has to be constrained uh to ensure</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.679" end="01:15:38.640" style="s2">so this consequence capture has to apply</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.320" end="01:15:40.640" style="s2">to those processes that implement</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.640" end="01:15:42.480" style="s2">governance and consequence capture</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.640" end="01:15:44.159" style="s2">and then there it has to apply more than</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.480" end="01:15:46.800" style="s2">anywhere else because</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.159" end="01:15:48.480" style="s2">there&#39;s power there so you absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.800" end="01:15:51.040" style="s2">have to constrain it otherwise it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.480" end="01:15:51.760" style="s2">potential for doing harm is far greater</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.040" end="01:15:55.120" style="s2">so you</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.760" end="01:15:58.080" style="s2">you have to subject it to constraints uh</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.120" end="01:16:00.800" style="s2">and design these processes where the</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.080" end="01:16:05.120" style="s2">only way the governors</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.800" end="01:16:06.480" style="s2">can act uh effectively for themselves</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.120" end="01:16:08.239" style="s2">is to govern in the interests of the</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.480" end="01:16:10.960" style="s2">whole</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.239" end="01:16:12.480" style="s2">um at whatever level they&#39;re at but</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.960" end="01:16:12.800" style="s2">whether it&#39;s you know at a lower level</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.480" end="01:16:15.679" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.800" end="01:16:17.280" style="s2">at a higher scale but yeah just just to</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.679" end="01:16:21.040" style="s2">to sort of have</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.280" end="01:16:24.960" style="s2">now probably have the most difficult um</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.040" end="01:16:27.440" style="s2">issue of all raised so so</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.960" end="01:16:29.199" style="s2">the big insight i had that led to my</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.440" end="01:16:30.800" style="s2">views was</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.199" end="01:16:33.120" style="s2">you know i can remember to this day it</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.800" end="01:16:34.000" style="s2">was in my fam in the family room of my</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.120" end="01:16:37.920" style="s2">house in canberra</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.000" end="01:16:41.040" style="s2">where i was living at the time</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.920" end="01:16:42.800" style="s2">and i had this and it is a vision</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.040" end="01:16:44.320" style="s2">it&#39;s a vision of equivalence and the</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.800" end="01:16:47.280" style="s2">vision was that</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.320" end="01:16:48.480" style="s2">the cell managed by the genetic</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.280" end="01:16:50.320" style="s2">apparatus</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.480" end="01:16:51.760" style="s2">introducing consequence capture for the</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.320" end="01:16:56.159" style="s2">cell</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.760" end="01:16:59.199" style="s2">was equivalent to the globe</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.159" end="01:17:00.880" style="s2">uh managed by humanity</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.199" end="01:17:03.360" style="s2">introducing consequence capture for the</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.880" end="01:17:06.960" style="s2">globe</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.360" end="01:17:10.320" style="s2">now uh so</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.960" end="01:17:12.719" style="s2">the planet probably the the end point</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.320" end="01:17:14.320" style="s2">of evolution for the planet is</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.719" end="01:17:18.080" style="s2">equivalent to</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.320" end="01:17:21.360" style="s2">the way a cell is organized um</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.080" end="01:17:24.159" style="s2">where that gets sort of difficult um</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.360" end="01:17:25.760" style="s2">for probably most people is that so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.159" end="01:17:27.520" style="s2">not talking about</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.760" end="01:17:28.880" style="s2">consequence capture only for human</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.520" end="01:17:32.080" style="s2">society</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.880" end="01:17:33.760" style="s2">yeah yeah so coming back to you</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.080" end="01:17:35.840" style="s2">it&#39;s your fundamental thing that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.760" end="01:17:37.679" style="s2">been</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.840" end="01:17:39.360" style="s2">trying to raise and emphasize throughout</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.679" end="01:17:40.880" style="s2">this and i&#39;ve sort of</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.360" end="01:17:42.880" style="s2">moved off into other things but i</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.880" end="01:17:46.159" style="s2">intended to come back to it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.880" end="01:17:49.679" style="s2">yeah i mean humanity the only</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.159" end="01:17:49.679" style="s2">in any way the only</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.840" end="01:17:54.320" style="s2">to believe that humanity is somehow</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.840" end="01:17:57.440" style="s2">separate or separable or imaginable</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.320" end="01:18:00.000" style="s2">as separable uh to everything else</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.440" end="01:18:01.600" style="s2">in the whole universe in fact is to have</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.000" end="01:18:03.280" style="s2">a mental illness</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.600" end="01:18:05.600" style="s2">so it&#39;s only the analytical rational</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.280" end="01:18:07.760" style="s2">philosophers who are manifestations in</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.600" end="01:18:10.480" style="s2">my view of a mental illness</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.760" end="01:18:11.280" style="s2">who can think you know can think oh yeah</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.480" end="01:18:13.760" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.280" end="01:18:15.120" style="s2">humanity is separate so so how should we</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.760" end="01:18:16.640" style="s2">behave and what are the consequences of</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.120" end="01:18:19.440" style="s2">that i mean it&#39;s just crazy</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.640" end="01:18:21.040" style="s2">so so consequence capture has to apply</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.440" end="01:18:24.960" style="s2">to the whole system so</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.040" end="01:18:27.199" style="s2">so the the emergent</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.960" end="01:18:29.040" style="s2">uh you know next step in the evolution</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.199" end="01:18:32.080" style="s2">of life on this planet</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.040" end="01:18:35.600" style="s2">is not human society it&#39;s it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.080" end="01:18:38.320" style="s2">global super organism uh</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.600" end="01:18:40.400" style="s2">with humanity in relation to the other</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.320" end="01:18:41.679" style="s2">living processes and the physical</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.400" end="01:18:43.679" style="s2">processes</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.679" end="01:18:44.960" style="s2">the you know biogeochemical cycles on</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.679" end="01:18:46.719" style="s2">the planet and everything else</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.960" end="01:18:48.080" style="s2">the relationship of humanity to them is</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.719" end="01:18:49.840" style="s2">the same</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.080" end="01:18:51.440" style="s2">as the relationship of you know the</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.840" end="01:18:54.880" style="s2">genetic apparatus</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.440" end="01:18:56.640" style="s2">to the cell so uh so consequence capture</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.880" end="01:18:58.320" style="s2">has to apply to the whole thing but then</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.640" end="01:19:01.520" style="s2">then the really bad news comes in so</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.320" end="01:19:03.520" style="s2">i&#39;ll just get that off my chest</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.520" end="01:19:05.760" style="s2">because because then if you step back</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.520" end="01:19:08.400" style="s2">and look at the whole shebang</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.760" end="01:19:10.480" style="s2">from the beginning of living processes</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.400" end="01:19:13.920" style="s2">cooperatives</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.480" end="01:19:15.120" style="s2">of smaller than a millionth of a meter</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.920" end="01:19:17.120" style="s2">across</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.120" end="01:19:19.120" style="s2">and gradually increasing in scale and</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.120" end="01:19:22.320" style="s2">christening scale until you have</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.120" end="01:19:24.640" style="s2">a cooperative for the whole planet</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.320" end="01:19:24.640" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.520" end="01:19:28.560" style="s2">if you look back at that whole process</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.199" end="01:19:33.520" style="s2">and say what the hell is it</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.560" end="01:19:36.960" style="s2">what it what it is what is analogous to</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.520" end="01:19:39.840" style="s2">is an egg</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.960" end="01:19:42.080" style="s2">so and i take the old chicken egg so so</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.840" end="01:19:45.760" style="s2">the chicken egg begins</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.080" end="01:19:50.480" style="s2">with you know a fertilized egg</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.760" end="01:19:53.920" style="s2">a cell infinitesimal on the scale of the</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.480" end="01:19:55.360" style="s2">the egg and then that reproduces and</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.920" end="01:20:00.159" style="s2">forms structures and</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.360" end="01:20:04.880" style="s2">so on and so forth using up the yolk</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.159" end="01:20:08.560" style="s2">and the yolk is the coal and</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.880" end="01:20:10.080" style="s2">uh the coal and fuel</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.560" end="01:20:11.920" style="s2">and you&#39;ve got to use up the yolk</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.080" end="01:20:13.040" style="s2">otherwise you&#39;d never get you know if</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.920" end="01:20:14.960" style="s2">there&#39;s a revolution</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.040" end="01:20:16.719" style="s2">within an egg you know when you got a</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.960" end="01:20:19.360" style="s2">few thousand cells and they said</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.719" end="01:20:20.800" style="s2">sit there and they say shit we&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.360" end="01:20:23.840" style="s2">up this yolk</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.800" end="01:20:25.600" style="s2">you know that&#39;s not sustainable we&#39;ll uh</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.840" end="01:20:28.320" style="s2">we&#39;ll run out of yolk and we&#39;ll all die</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.600" end="01:20:28.320" style="s2">we&#39;ll be finished</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.560" end="01:20:33.280" style="s2">to an extent you know we need to use our</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.920" end="01:20:35.360" style="s2">yoke</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.280" end="01:20:36.639" style="s2">but we you need it to build the next</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.360" end="01:20:39.199" style="s2">bill to the next level where we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.639" end="01:20:39.199" style="s2">need the yogurt</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.760" end="01:20:43.520" style="s2">right is it yeah you said that the</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.239" end="01:20:46.719" style="s2">fossil fuels were</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.520" end="01:20:47.520" style="s2">like the starter engine on on spaceship</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.719" end="01:20:50.239" style="s2">earth that we</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.520" end="01:20:51.199" style="s2">we needed it to get to that next level</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.239" end="01:20:53.920" style="s2">of making the whole thing</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.199" end="01:20:54.800" style="s2">all right oh well isn&#39;t that wonderful</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.920" end="01:20:56.560" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.800" end="01:20:57.840" style="s2">yeah i use the yolk analogy but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.560" end="01:20:59.679" style="s2">exactly the same</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.840" end="01:21:02.159" style="s2">so i like yours better because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.679" end="01:21:04.159" style="s2">biological rather than mechanistic</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.159" end="01:21:05.840" style="s2">and you can imagine these smart cells</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.159" end="01:21:07.199" style="s2">waking up and saying fuck we&#39;re you know</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.840" end="01:21:08.320" style="s2">we&#39;re eating our way out of house and</p>

<p begin="01:21:11.679" end="01:21:14.239" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.080" end="01:21:15.920" style="s2">i just wanted to make this analogy from</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.239" end="01:21:17.440" style="s2">what you said earlier and what very much</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.920" end="01:21:20.239" style="s2">relates to this is that</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.440" end="01:21:20.719" style="s2">um if you look at buzz holling&#39;s work on</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.239" end="01:21:24.400" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.719" end="01:21:27.840" style="s2">resilience uh and and</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.400" end="01:21:28.480" style="s2">maintaining health in ecological systems</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.840" end="01:21:31.280" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.480" end="01:21:32.000" style="s2">taking that to socioecological systems</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.280" end="01:21:33.679" style="s2">very often</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.000" end="01:21:35.600" style="s2">resilience gets a bad word because of</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.679" end="01:21:37.040" style="s2">course we&#39;ve we&#39;ve now seen that part of</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.600" end="01:21:38.719" style="s2">the the problem that we&#39;ve had is that</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.040" end="01:21:40.880" style="s2">the old system we built is incredibly</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.719" end="01:21:43.440" style="s2">resilient and keeps bouncing back</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.880" end="01:21:45.199" style="s2">but this the distinction between three</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.440" end="01:21:48.800" style="s2">levels of resilience of the</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.199" end="01:21:51.520" style="s2">the kind of um persistence level</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.800" end="01:21:52.639" style="s2">so in the face of this disruption i stay</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.520" end="01:21:55.600" style="s2">the same</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.639" end="01:21:58.400" style="s2">and then then if that disruption gets</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.600" end="01:22:01.440" style="s2">too strong and i get</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.400" end="01:22:03.920" style="s2">temporarily pushed out of balance</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.440" end="01:22:05.040" style="s2">then there&#39;s an adaptive part of</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.920" end="01:22:07.360" style="s2">resilience where you</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.040" end="01:22:08.719" style="s2">where you can adapt a little bit and</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.360" end="01:22:11.120" style="s2">bounce back to</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.719" end="01:22:11.840" style="s2">more or less status quo those are the</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.120" end="01:22:14.480" style="s2">two</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.840" end="01:22:16.800" style="s2">two levels of resilience that you</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.480" end="01:22:18.760" style="s2">observe also in ecosystems</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.800" end="01:22:20.719" style="s2">but when you when you take the jump to</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.760" end="01:22:21.600" style="s2">socioecological systems where you</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.719" end="01:22:24.960" style="s2">include</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.600" end="01:22:25.360" style="s2">our human affairs as we&#39;re obviously</p>

<p begin="01:22:28.880" end="01:22:35.199" style="s2">that important dimension of foresight of</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.239" end="01:22:36.639" style="s2">awareness of what&#39;s coming into the</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.199" end="01:22:39.360" style="s2">system and that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.639" end="01:22:39.920" style="s2">you can have transformative resilience</p>

<p begin="01:22:39.920" end="01:22:44.880" style="s2">the evolutionary jump um that actually</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.560" end="01:22:48.560" style="s2">necessitates our human awareness</p>

<p begin="01:22:48.560" end="01:22:54.080" style="s2">in order to say okay we&#39;ve we&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="01:23:08.000" end="01:23:12.159" style="s2">um but with that foresight we can now</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.880" end="01:23:16.000" style="s2">begin to</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.159" end="01:23:17.360" style="s2">establish that um global consequence</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.000" end="01:23:20.320" style="s2">capture which which to me</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.360" end="01:23:21.679" style="s2">that&#39;s why i&#39;m hopeful that this notion</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.320" end="01:23:24.480" style="s2">of planetary health is</p>

<p begin="01:23:27.600" end="01:23:34.239" style="s2">journey is actually if we</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.600" end="01:23:37.040" style="s2">um create a growth hierarchy system that</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.239" end="01:23:37.600" style="s2">enables where our human actions enable</p>

<p begin="01:27:46.480" end="01:27:50.960" style="s2">developing the capacities that enable us</p>

<p begin="01:27:50.960" end="01:27:57.600" style="s2">act first and foremost act</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.080" end="01:28:00.239" style="s2">with one voice so you&#39;ve probably heard</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.600" end="01:28:03.199" style="s2">of the fermi paradox which is um</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.239" end="01:28:05.040" style="s2">the fermi paradoxes well you know if all</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.199" end="01:28:06.480" style="s2">this life is everywhere well</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.040" end="01:28:08.239" style="s2">elsewhere in the universe why haven&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.480" end="01:28:09.360" style="s2">seen it you know why don&#39;t we detect it</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.239" end="01:28:11.760" style="s2">why</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.360" end="01:28:12.719" style="s2">and and i would say the answer is is</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.760" end="01:28:16.000" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.719" end="01:28:20.320" style="s2">um for the same reason that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.000" end="01:28:23.679" style="s2">uh you know interfere in</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.320" end="01:28:25.440" style="s2">embryos and try and talk to them and</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.679" end="01:28:27.840" style="s2">deal with them and so on</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.440" end="01:28:29.440" style="s2">uh we don&#39;t exist yet you know we&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.840" end="01:28:33.280" style="s2">babble</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.440" end="01:28:36.560" style="s2">we&#39;re subplanetary we we</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.280" end="01:28:37.600" style="s2">uh yeah it&#39;s like i just have to share</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.560" end="01:28:39.440" style="s2">this because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.600" end="01:28:41.440" style="s2">for me you know that calvin and hobbes</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.440" end="01:28:44.080" style="s2">cartoons</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.440" end="01:28:45.600" style="s2">yeah the little boy and the tiger um</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.080" end="01:28:47.600" style="s2">there&#39;s a wonderful cartoon where they</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.600" end="01:28:49.280" style="s2">they stand in front of a bunch of um</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.600" end="01:28:50.639" style="s2">chopped off trees just tree trunks and</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.280" end="01:28:52.880" style="s2">litter everywhere</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.639" end="01:28:54.320" style="s2">and calvin says to hobbs i think the</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.880" end="01:28:56.239" style="s2">most convincing</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.320" end="01:28:57.520" style="s2">evidence for higher intelligence and</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.239" end="01:28:58.800" style="s2">outer space is that they haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.520" end="01:29:02.239" style="s2">contacted us yet</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.800" end="01:29:04.320" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s good that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.239" end="01:29:05.840" style="s2">but the but the key reason why they</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.320" end="01:29:07.520" style="s2">don&#39;t you know so</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.840" end="01:29:11.840" style="s2">so people say well you know won&#39;t they</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.520" end="01:29:11.840" style="s2">help us over these difficulties</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.239" end="01:29:17.840" style="s2">because they&#39;re systems thinkers</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.440" end="01:29:19.600" style="s2">these other planetary organisms because</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.840" end="01:29:21.280" style="s2">you don&#39;t get to their stage without</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.600" end="01:29:23.760" style="s2">having</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.280" end="01:29:26.400" style="s2">you know the success of at least some</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.760" end="01:29:28.480" style="s2">systems thinkers to imbue the</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.400" end="01:29:30.880" style="s2">the hatching super organism with systems</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.480" end="01:29:33.760" style="s2">thinking if they&#39;re systems thinking</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.880" end="01:29:35.280" style="s2">thinkers they know that the only way we</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.760" end="01:29:38.400" style="s2">will develop</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.280" end="01:29:40.159" style="s2">the global structures the constraints on</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.400" end="01:29:42.080" style="s2">those global structures the consequence</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.159" end="01:29:46.159" style="s2">capture for the whole planet</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.080" end="01:29:49.440" style="s2">is if we go through these uh challenges</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.159" end="01:29:53.440" style="s2">that evoke and call for</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.440" end="01:29:56.639" style="s2">those emergencies so they would be</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.440" end="01:30:00.080" style="s2">killing us to intervene</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.639" end="01:30:04.800" style="s2">uh it&#39;ll be totally false concern</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.080" end="01:30:07.440" style="s2">for us to take away these stimuli</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.800" end="01:30:08.560" style="s2">and challenges that we need to develop</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.440" end="01:30:11.440" style="s2">the structures that we</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.560" end="01:30:13.199" style="s2">that that will help actualize us at the</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.440" end="01:30:14.880" style="s2">next level</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.199" end="01:30:16.560" style="s2">but coming back to the bad news i know</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.880" end="01:30:19.760" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to distract me but the</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.560" end="01:30:23.280" style="s2">um so coming coming back to the</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.760" end="01:30:27.360" style="s2">embryo uh and the yolk</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.280" end="01:30:30.560" style="s2">um and the</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.360" end="01:30:35.120" style="s2">it hatching as a</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.560" end="01:30:37.040" style="s2">uh as a chicken and as i said in</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.120" end="01:30:38.719" style="s2">well you know we started on very small</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.040" end="01:30:41.280" style="s2">scale and</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.719" end="01:30:43.600" style="s2">diversified integrated progressively and</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.280" end="01:30:46.560" style="s2">you know now we&#39;re covering the whole</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.600" end="01:30:47.280" style="s2">shebang and we&#39;re on the verge of of</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.560" end="01:30:49.679" style="s2">hatching</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.280" end="01:30:53.040" style="s2">a global organism which is not just</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.679" end="01:30:53.040" style="s2">humanity but humanity</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.199" end="01:31:01.199" style="s2">and the whole living system the</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.440" end="01:31:03.600" style="s2">the uh the chicken</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.199" end="01:31:05.280" style="s2">leaves behind it you know the broken</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.600" end="01:31:08.320" style="s2">eggshell</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.280" end="01:31:11.280" style="s2">uh quite a bit of gunk</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.320" end="01:31:12.639" style="s2">i&#39;ll just call it gunk but that was part</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.280" end="01:31:16.800" style="s2">of the living</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.639" end="01:31:18.719" style="s2">part of the egg because what what</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.800" end="01:31:20.320" style="s2">quite a lot of the processes were in the</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.719" end="01:31:22.880" style="s2">egg including the</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.320" end="01:31:25.679" style="s2">shell itself was scaffold with</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.880" end="01:31:28.639" style="s2">scaffolding</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.679" end="01:31:28.639" style="s2">and scaffolding</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.520" end="01:31:32.560" style="s2">you uh you believe behind that when you</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.360" end="01:31:37.920" style="s2">hatch</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.560" end="01:31:41.440" style="s2">you know um so all the living processes</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.920" end="01:31:44.560" style="s2">on this planet uh you know when</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.440" end="01:31:46.080" style="s2">humanity governs them</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.560" end="01:31:47.840" style="s2">and that and implements consequence</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.080" end="01:31:52.880" style="s2">capture it&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.840" end="01:31:54.639" style="s2">and and looks at how to you know make</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.880" end="01:31:56.159" style="s2">the planetary organism into a viable</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.639" end="01:31:58.880" style="s2">system that&#39;s as good a</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.159" end="01:31:59.360" style="s2">good a model as you know most people</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.880" end="01:32:02.800" style="s2">would have</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.360" end="01:32:06.159" style="s2">staff would be this viable system um</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.800" end="01:32:08.239" style="s2">when we do that then some of the living</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.159" end="01:32:11.360" style="s2">processes and</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.239" end="01:32:12.719" style="s2">parts of the ecosystems and so on uh</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.360" end="01:32:15.440" style="s2">it&#39;ll become evident that they were</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.719" end="01:32:15.440" style="s2">scaffolding</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.239" end="01:32:20.719" style="s2">and we they won&#39;t come with us on our</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.000" end="01:32:22.480" style="s2">journey</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.719" end="01:32:23.760" style="s2">spin that analogy a bit further what</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.480" end="01:32:28.000" style="s2">does that</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.760" end="01:32:33.199" style="s2">mean in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.000" end="01:32:37.120" style="s2">the complex ecosystems and planetary</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.199" end="01:32:39.920" style="s2">well some yeah some but some of it</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.120" end="01:32:40.480" style="s2">what proportion of it i have no idea but</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.920" end="01:32:42.719" style="s2">some of it</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.480" end="01:32:44.239" style="s2">won&#39;t be necessary for the flourishing</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.719" end="01:32:47.120" style="s2">and might actually be</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.239" end="01:32:50.000" style="s2">detrimental on a waste of resources for</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.120" end="01:32:52.159" style="s2">the flourishing of the super organism</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.000" end="01:32:52.159" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.120" end="01:32:56.480" style="s2">just was a little bit conscious of time</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.520" end="01:33:00.159" style="s2">we&#39;ve got about another</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.480" end="01:33:02.080" style="s2">yeah in 15 minutes and and this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.159" end="01:33:03.600" style="s2">edges onto something that also there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.080" end="01:33:04.239" style="s2">two things and maybe we have another</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.600" end="01:33:06.320" style="s2">call</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.239" end="01:33:08.000" style="s2">um because it&#39;s been really insightful</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.320" end="01:33:11.199" style="s2">for me and interesting</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.000" end="01:33:12.960" style="s2">uh the the the two things that i kind of</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.199" end="01:33:16.239" style="s2">wanted to ask you</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.960" end="01:33:20.719" style="s2">in this context one is how</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.239" end="01:33:24.320" style="s2">does like um</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.719" end="01:33:28.800" style="s2">the whole pro social evolution</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.320" end="01:33:31.600" style="s2">idea um square with with your take</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.800" end="01:33:32.320" style="s2">but but this this might be for the next</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.600" end="01:33:35.840" style="s2">call</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.320" end="01:33:36.560" style="s2">um but the the role of technology in all</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.840" end="01:33:41.120" style="s2">of this</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.560" end="01:33:41.120" style="s2">um i have a sense that we</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.320" end="01:33:48.400" style="s2">we were betting too much on technology</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.360" end="01:33:50.159" style="s2">to to save us in in this because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.400" end="01:33:51.520" style="s2">it&#39;s actually part of that process that</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.159" end="01:33:53.680" style="s2">takes us away from</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.520" end="01:33:56.480" style="s2">understanding the um</p>

<p begin="01:33:56.480" end="01:34:03.199" style="s2">the dynamics at the lower levels of this</p>

<p begin="01:34:11.679" end="01:34:15.199" style="s2">and well i suppose the second point</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.840" end="01:34:19.440" style="s2">first</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.199" end="01:34:22.239" style="s2">my my view is is that um</p>

<p begin="01:34:48.159" end="01:34:51.760" style="s2">isn&#39;t part of that at all but just just</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.119" end="01:34:53.360" style="s2">to be clear</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.760" end="01:34:55.520" style="s2">when you when you speak of the chicken</p>

<p begin="01:34:59.199" end="01:35:02.800" style="s2">which which and let me just quickly</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.440" end="01:35:06.239" style="s2">emphasize</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.800" end="01:35:08.800" style="s2">um it won&#39;t be humanity</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.239" end="01:35:10.239" style="s2">and it won&#39;t have humanity&#39;s values it</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.800" end="01:35:12.560" style="s2">would be</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.239" end="01:35:14.800" style="s2">just imagine if if the cells becoming</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.560" end="01:35:16.960" style="s2">multicellular organisms</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.800" end="01:35:18.000" style="s2">you know i sometimes imagine they had a</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.960" end="01:35:19.199" style="s2">conference you know</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.000" end="01:35:21.600" style="s2">and they said shit you know we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.199" end="01:35:23.760" style="s2">want to group together and</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.600" end="01:35:25.040" style="s2">eating each other&#39;s shit you know you</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.760" end="01:35:27.040" style="s2">know you know</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.040" end="01:35:28.320" style="s2">all stuck to one another you yeah</p>
<p begin="01:35:27.040" end="01:35:32.639" style="s2">they&#39;re like americans yeah</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.320" end="01:35:35.199" style="s2">we want freedom we want freedom</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.639" end="01:35:36.960" style="s2">basically to summon it up their values</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.199" end="01:35:39.040" style="s2">as individual cells would be quite</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.960" end="01:35:41.920" style="s2">inconsistent with the values</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.040" end="01:35:43.520" style="s2">of the next stage you know of the well</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.920" end="01:35:47.280" style="s2">unimaginable</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.520" end="01:35:50.560" style="s2">to you know the so</p>
<p begin="01:35:47.280" end="01:35:52.159" style="s2">the idea that somehow uh</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.560" end="01:35:54.320" style="s2">you know the super organism will be a</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.159" end="01:35:55.280" style="s2">manifestation of human values you know</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.320" end="01:36:00.159" style="s2">is just</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.280" end="01:36:01.920" style="s2">insane the</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.159" end="01:36:03.520" style="s2">however the super organism will look at</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.920" end="01:36:04.320" style="s2">look after humans at whatever level</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.520" end="01:36:06.880" style="s2">they&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.320" end="01:36:08.000" style="s2">and make use of them as part of its</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.880" end="01:36:11.119" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="01:36:08.000" end="01:36:13.280" style="s2">but it&#39;ll try and develop humans</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.119" end="01:36:14.159" style="s2">and one of the key steps in the</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.280" end="01:36:16.880" style="s2">development of an</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.159" end="01:36:18.719" style="s2">individual human being is to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:36:16.880" end="01:36:20.560" style="s2">transcend their</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.719" end="01:36:23.600" style="s2">the values and impulses they get from</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.560" end="01:36:25.280" style="s2">their biological and cultural past</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.600" end="01:36:26.800" style="s2">so it&#39;s the capacity to move at right</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.280" end="01:36:28.400" style="s2">angles</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.800" end="01:36:29.920" style="s2">to their biological and cultural past</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.400" end="01:36:30.719" style="s2">and i don&#39;t know if it&#39;s happened to you</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.920" end="01:36:32.800" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.719" end="01:36:34.480" style="s2">to pursue the path that i&#39;ve both</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.800" end="01:36:37.040" style="s2">pursued</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.480" end="01:36:37.840" style="s2">then my original motivations which were</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.040" end="01:36:41.159" style="s2">you know as a t</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.840" end="01:36:43.119" style="s2">as a 20 year old you know large part of</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.159" end="01:36:44.000" style="s2">self-aggrandizement and you know wanting</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.119" end="01:36:45.840" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.000" end="01:36:47.440" style="s2">be a successful philosopher and be</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.840" end="01:36:49.199" style="s2">revered and you know</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.440" end="01:36:51.679" style="s2">nearly every scientist dreams have been</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.199" end="01:36:54.800" style="s2">galileo or darwin</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.679" end="01:36:56.880" style="s2">but you know that&#39;s i&#39;ve had to</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.800" end="01:36:59.040" style="s2">to to achieve the goals the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.880" end="01:37:00.320" style="s2">goals yeah i&#39;ve had to</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.040" end="01:37:02.080" style="s2">you know and there&#39;s various techniques</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.320" end="01:37:03.119" style="s2">you can do do it do for it but you know</p>
<p begin="01:37:02.080" end="01:37:06.639" style="s2">i meditate and</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.119" end="01:37:09.920" style="s2">and so on and i become try to become</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.639" end="01:37:11.600" style="s2">transparent to my emotions and so on uh</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.920" end="01:37:13.280" style="s2">in other words they flow through me i</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.600" end="01:37:15.040" style="s2">note them but</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.280" end="01:37:17.440" style="s2">they they&#39;re not me i don&#39;t i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.040" end="01:37:19.600" style="s2">captured by them i&#39;m not jerked around</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.440" end="01:37:21.840" style="s2">by them i can move in any direction that</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.600" end="01:37:24.480" style="s2">evolution demands of me</p>
<p begin="01:37:21.840" end="01:37:26.480" style="s2">uh and that could be you know totally</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.480" end="01:37:28.560" style="s2">different uh</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.480" end="01:37:29.520" style="s2">human values uh we we won&#39;t get into</p>
<p begin="01:37:28.560" end="01:37:30.960" style="s2">that now but</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.520" end="01:37:32.840" style="s2">you know it might mean that i&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="01:37:30.960" end="01:37:34.480" style="s2">traitor i have to become a traitor to</p>
<p begin="01:37:32.840" end="01:37:38.159" style="s2">australia</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.480" end="01:37:39.520" style="s2">um to you know to advance the</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.159" end="01:37:42.560" style="s2">evolutionary process</p>
<p begin="01:37:39.520" end="01:37:44.159" style="s2">so whatever it demands of me i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.560" end="01:37:46.080" style="s2">developed you know tried to develop the</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.159" end="01:37:49.520" style="s2">capacity so so yeah the</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.080" end="01:37:51.920" style="s2">the um so what green people</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.520" end="01:37:54.480" style="s2">or orange people or blue people or</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.920" end="01:37:58.159" style="s2">whatever value now</p>
<p begin="01:37:54.480" end="01:38:03.440" style="s2">uh is highly unlikely to be</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.159" end="01:38:05.040" style="s2">the values of this planetary organism</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.440" end="01:38:06.800" style="s2">but there&#39;s it&#39;s important because you</p>
<p begin="01:38:05.040" end="01:38:08.320" style="s2">know you made a in the use of spiral</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.800" end="01:38:10.719" style="s2">dynamics you made a common</p>
<p begin="01:38:08.320" end="01:38:12.560" style="s2">um you&#39;re probably not thinking of it</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.719" end="01:38:14.320" style="s2">that way but the way you phrased it</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.560" end="01:38:16.000" style="s2">and there aren&#39;t any green people there</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.320" end="01:38:17.199" style="s2">aren&#39;t any blue people there aren&#39;t any</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.000" end="01:38:19.280" style="s2">orange people it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:17.199" end="01:38:20.320" style="s2">types in people rather than types of</p>
<p begin="01:38:19.280" end="01:38:22.800" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.320" end="01:38:23.440" style="s2">yeah yeah just people that are arrested</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.800" end="01:38:26.960" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="01:38:23.440" end="01:38:29.040" style="s2">their perspective in on that</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.960" end="01:38:30.000" style="s2">particular value immune cluster um but</p>
<p begin="01:38:29.040" end="01:38:31.760" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.000" end="01:38:33.360" style="s2">once you&#39;re a green person you&#39;ll you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:38:31.760" end="01:38:33.679" style="s2">have to stay a green person you can you</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.360" end="01:38:36.480" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.679" end="01:38:37.360" style="s2">actually make that&#39;s right and clearly</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.480" end="01:38:39.600" style="s2">clearly the</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.360" end="01:38:42.239" style="s2">uh consequence capture would operate in</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.600" end="01:38:45.440" style="s2">the global super organism to</p>
<p begin="01:38:42.239" end="01:38:46.880" style="s2">to organize processes that that maximize</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.440" end="01:38:48.880" style="s2">the potential</p>
<p begin="01:38:46.880" end="01:38:50.880" style="s2">development of of every human being</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.880" end="01:38:55.440" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:38:50.880" end="01:38:57.280" style="s2">the uh you know they&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="01:38:55.440" end="01:38:58.800" style="s2">highly intelligent potentially creative</p>
<p begin="01:38:57.280" end="01:39:00.880" style="s2">components</p>
<p begin="01:38:58.800" end="01:39:03.600" style="s2">that will enable the super organism to</p>
<p begin="01:39:00.880" end="01:39:07.040" style="s2">be highly adaptive and highly available</p>
<p begin="01:39:03.600" end="01:39:08.960" style="s2">um coming back to pro pro social</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.040" end="01:39:11.119" style="s2">were you talking about was that an</p>
<p begin="01:39:08.960" end="01:39:13.760" style="s2">allusion to david slain wilson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.119" end="01:39:14.639" style="s2">yeah and right because it it seems</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.760" end="01:39:17.360" style="s2">somewhat</p>
<p begin="01:39:14.639" end="01:39:18.000" style="s2">related but but i i sense that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:39:17.360" end="01:39:21.199" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.000" end="01:39:23.840" style="s2">same take at all</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.199" end="01:39:24.639" style="s2">he speaks like that the summary is is</p>
<p begin="01:39:23.840" end="01:39:26.320" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.639" end="01:39:28.080" style="s2">between individuals competitive</p>
<p begin="01:39:26.320" end="01:39:29.920" style="s2">individuals will beat</p>
<p begin="01:39:28.080" end="01:39:32.000" style="s2">collaborative individuals but between</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.920" end="01:39:34.880" style="s2">groups collaborative groups will be</p>
<p begin="01:39:32.000" end="01:39:35.600" style="s2">beat competitive groups sort of and</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.880" end="01:39:37.600" style="s2">therefore</p>
<p begin="01:39:35.600" end="01:39:39.119" style="s2">there&#39;s an evolutionary pressure towards</p>
<p begin="01:39:37.600" end="01:39:42.239" style="s2">pro-social behavior</p>
<p begin="01:39:39.119" end="01:39:43.040" style="s2">um it kind of links to some of what</p>
<p begin="01:39:42.239" end="01:39:44.880" style="s2">you&#39;ve been saying</p>
<p begin="01:39:43.040" end="01:39:46.639" style="s2">but yeah he has no concept like</p>
<p begin="01:39:44.880" end="01:39:47.600" style="s2">governance so he doesn&#39;t recognize</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.639" end="01:39:51.119" style="s2">management as</p>
<p begin="01:39:47.600" end="01:39:54.560" style="s2">as or anything like consequence capture</p>
<p begin="01:39:51.119" end="01:39:57.360" style="s2">but no recently um over the last year</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.560" end="01:39:59.600" style="s2">i tried to get the 15 top evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.360" end="01:40:03.119" style="s2">scientists in the world</p>
<p begin="01:39:59.600" end="01:40:07.280" style="s2">to to say that evolutionary science now</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.119" end="01:40:10.320" style="s2">can say something to humanity about</p>
<p begin="01:40:07.280" end="01:40:14.159" style="s2">uh the evolutionary imperative</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.320" end="01:40:17.040" style="s2">being that we move to a global society</p>
<p begin="01:40:14.159" end="01:40:18.639" style="s2">with global governance and so on and and</p>
<p begin="01:40:17.040" end="01:40:21.920" style="s2">i think</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.639" end="01:40:23.679" style="s2">that whilst hardly any evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:40:21.920" end="01:40:26.480" style="s2">scientist has</p>
<p begin="01:40:23.679" end="01:40:28.719" style="s2">you know said that directly except</p>
<p begin="01:40:26.480" end="01:40:31.440" style="s2">davidson wilson in his latest book</p>
<p begin="01:40:28.719" end="01:40:32.480" style="s2">did talk about a super organism it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.440" end="01:40:34.880" style="s2">small step</p>
<p begin="01:40:32.480" end="01:40:36.159" style="s2">so they re most of my story except for</p>
<p begin="01:40:34.880" end="01:40:37.600" style="s2">the data the pattern</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.159" end="01:40:39.440" style="s2">so let&#39;s put it this way the pattern of</p>
<p begin="01:40:37.600" end="01:40:42.239" style="s2">successive integration</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.440" end="01:40:43.360" style="s2">is recognized by evolution science what</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.239" end="01:40:45.280" style="s2">does it</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.360" end="01:40:46.800" style="s2">you know what produces that pattern is</p>
<p begin="01:40:45.280" end="01:40:48.480" style="s2">controversial</p>
<p begin="01:40:46.800" end="01:40:51.280" style="s2">but for the point of view of saving</p>
<p begin="01:40:48.480" end="01:40:54.960" style="s2">fucking the planet and humanity</p>
<p begin="01:40:51.280" end="01:40:56.719" style="s2">um they can all sign up in my view to</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.960" end="01:40:59.280" style="s2">the proposition that we need to go to</p>
<p begin="01:40:56.719" end="01:41:00.639" style="s2">the next step as a global system global</p>
<p begin="01:40:59.280" end="01:41:02.560" style="s2">coordination</p>
<p begin="01:41:00.639" end="01:41:04.960" style="s2">so i tried to get davidson wilson to</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.560" end="01:41:06.320" style="s2">lead it because i i don&#39;t have the um</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.960" end="01:41:08.400" style="s2">you know the recognition and so on</p>
<p begin="01:41:06.320" end="01:41:12.080" style="s2">delete it um</p>
<p begin="01:41:08.400" end="01:41:15.760" style="s2">basically declined uh</p>
<p begin="01:41:12.080" end="01:41:18.960" style="s2">the uh</p>
<p begin="01:41:15.760" end="01:41:19.760" style="s2">it got a bit so and no one else put</p>
<p begin="01:41:18.960" end="01:41:22.880" style="s2">their hand up</p>
<p begin="01:41:19.760" end="01:41:25.760" style="s2">so now i&#39;m i&#39;ll never give up i mean the</p>
<p begin="01:41:22.880" end="01:41:27.119" style="s2">you know the the intentional move to a</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.760" end="01:41:30.880" style="s2">global society is</p>
<p begin="01:41:27.119" end="01:41:32.800" style="s2">you know the the goal of all</p>
<p begin="01:41:30.880" end="01:41:34.080" style="s2">intentional conscious evolutionaries in</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.800" end="01:41:37.280" style="s2">my view</p>
<p begin="01:41:34.080" end="01:41:41.760" style="s2">um so i&#39;m trying a different tech but</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.280" end="01:41:43.360" style="s2">but um so david&#39;s pro-social</p>
<p begin="01:41:41.760" end="01:41:45.520" style="s2">things which are all good you know all</p>
<p begin="01:41:43.360" end="01:41:46.880" style="s2">one is his movement is evolution</p>
<p begin="01:41:45.520" end="01:41:50.080" style="s2">institute and everything else</p>
<p begin="01:41:46.880" end="01:41:52.880" style="s2">is all wonderful stuff but i did make</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.080" end="01:41:55.920" style="s2">a sort of provocative comment in a in an</p>
<p begin="01:41:52.880" end="01:41:58.639" style="s2">email to him where i basically said well</p>
<p begin="01:41:55.920" end="01:42:01.040" style="s2">um you know yeah you&#39;re working at the</p>
<p begin="01:41:58.639" end="01:42:04.239" style="s2">lower level and that&#39;s admirable</p>
<p begin="01:42:01.040" end="01:42:07.119" style="s2">but the whole system&#39;s faced with</p>
<p begin="01:42:04.239" end="01:42:08.800" style="s2">collapse and i said it&#39;s a bit like a</p>
<p begin="01:42:07.119" end="01:42:12.080" style="s2">person whose</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.800" end="01:42:12.840" style="s2">house is burning down and spends his</p>
<p begin="01:42:12.080" end="01:42:15.600" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="01:42:12.840" end="01:42:16.880" style="s2">gardening and i say it&#39;s it&#39;s nice to</p>
<p begin="01:42:15.600" end="01:42:19.280" style="s2">have a nice garden</p>
<p begin="01:42:16.880" end="01:42:20.239" style="s2">around your house but if your house is</p>
<p begin="01:42:19.280" end="01:42:22.080" style="s2">burning down</p>
<p begin="01:42:20.239" end="01:42:25.520" style="s2">and you&#39;re focusing only on the</p>
<p begin="01:42:22.080" end="01:42:29.440" style="s2">gardening then that&#39;s dysfunctional</p>
<p begin="01:42:25.520" end="01:42:32.000" style="s2">so that was that was where we ended up</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.440" end="01:42:33.600" style="s2">he didn&#39;t take too kindly to that ism no</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.000" end="01:42:37.600" style="s2">no he didn&#39;t but um</p>
<p begin="01:42:33.600" end="01:42:38.480" style="s2">still anyway yeah that must be your 15</p>

<p begin="01:42:38.480" end="01:42:44.639" style="s2">yeah unfortunately</p>
<p begin="01:42:41.520" end="01:42:49.760" style="s2">because there&#39;s so many questions left</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.639" end="01:42:52.719" style="s2">but in terms of leaving people with a</p>

<p begin="01:44:17.199" end="01:44:21.440" style="s2">um part of the decision-making process</p>
<p begin="01:44:20.480" end="01:44:24.719" style="s2">down to</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.440" end="01:44:26.960" style="s2">the scale at which people have</p>

<p begin="01:44:36.480" end="01:44:41.199" style="s2">then feedback is imminent is much faster</p>
<p begin="01:44:39.360" end="01:44:44.159" style="s2">part of our problem is that we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:44:41.199" end="01:44:44.719" style="s2">building this global society that that</p>
<p begin="01:44:44.159" end="01:44:47.520" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:44:44.719" end="01:44:48.320" style="s2">on not society but global system that</p>
<p begin="01:44:47.520" end="01:44:51.520" style="s2">has</p>
<p begin="01:44:48.320" end="01:44:54.400" style="s2">um meant that</p>
<p begin="01:44:51.520" end="01:44:55.840" style="s2">so many of our actions in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:44:54.400" end="01:44:58.159" style="s2">driving climate change</p>
<p begin="01:44:55.840" end="01:44:59.199" style="s2">um have been buffered by the larger</p>

<p begin="01:44:59.199" end="01:45:05.280" style="s2">and we spent 50 years</p>
<p begin="01:45:02.480" end="01:45:06.239" style="s2">denying that we were running fast</p>
<p begin="01:45:05.280" end="01:45:10.000" style="s2">against the wall</p>
<p begin="01:45:06.239" end="01:45:13.440" style="s2">um so because yeah</p>
<p begin="01:45:10.000" end="01:45:16.880" style="s2">because um you know our</p>
<p begin="01:45:13.440" end="01:45:19.040" style="s2">current systems are perfectly organized</p>
<p begin="01:45:16.880" end="01:45:21.840" style="s2">to result in the self-organization of</p>

<p begin="01:45:21.840" end="01:45:27.119" style="s2">so consequence capture</p>
<p begin="01:45:24.960" end="01:45:29.520" style="s2">consequent capture rewards and punishes</p>
<p begin="01:45:27.119" end="01:45:31.679" style="s2">in relation to the</p>
<p begin="01:45:29.520" end="01:45:33.920" style="s2">interest of the whole but our current</p>
<p begin="01:45:31.679" end="01:45:35.440" style="s2">system rewards and punishes but what it</p>
<p begin="01:45:33.920" end="01:45:38.800" style="s2">rewards is</p>
<p begin="01:45:35.440" end="01:45:41.920" style="s2">behavior that kills other people</p>
<p begin="01:45:38.800" end="01:45:44.639" style="s2">that uh destroys ecosystems that</p>
<p begin="01:45:41.920" end="01:45:45.199" style="s2">you know is producing global warming so</p>
<p begin="01:45:44.639" end="01:45:49.119" style="s2">you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:45:45.199" end="01:45:51.600" style="s2">so what what an activist is is um</p>
<p begin="01:45:49.119" end="01:45:52.719" style="s2">is confronted with today is the exact</p>
<p begin="01:45:51.600" end="01:45:56.000" style="s2">opposite of</p>
<p begin="01:45:52.719" end="01:45:57.920" style="s2">the system the reward of bad behavior</p>
<p begin="01:45:56.000" end="01:46:00.239" style="s2">the self-organization the system</p>
<p begin="01:45:57.920" end="01:46:02.800" style="s2">self-organizes and rewards the bad</p>
<p begin="01:46:00.239" end="01:46:04.480" style="s2">not the good so what chance have you got</p>
<p begin="01:46:02.800" end="01:46:06.800" style="s2">so that that brings up in a whole</p>
<p begin="01:46:04.480" end="01:46:08.080" style="s2">another area is because this yeah we can</p>
<p begin="01:46:06.800" end="01:46:11.280" style="s2">have these ideas we</p>
<p begin="01:46:08.080" end="01:46:12.800" style="s2">we can we can convince ourselves that we</p>
<p begin="01:46:11.280" end="01:46:13.520" style="s2">know exactly where everything needs to</p>
<p begin="01:46:12.800" end="01:46:16.400" style="s2">go</p>
<p begin="01:46:13.520" end="01:46:16.719" style="s2">but how the hell do you get there um so</p>
<p begin="01:46:16.400" end="01:46:19.679" style="s2">i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:46:16.719" end="01:46:21.600" style="s2">i&#39;ve a you know paper a companion to the</p>
<p begin="01:46:19.679" end="01:46:23.840" style="s2">evolutionary manifesto was a</p>
<p begin="01:46:21.600" end="01:46:24.960" style="s2">paper called strategies for advancing</p>
<p begin="01:46:23.840" end="01:46:28.320" style="s2">evolution</p>
<p begin="01:46:24.960" end="01:46:30.880" style="s2">and that&#39;s what it addresses and uh</p>
<p begin="01:46:28.320" end="01:46:31.600" style="s2">and it takes into account the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:46:30.880" end="01:46:34.800" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="01:46:31.600" end="01:46:35.119" style="s2">all revolutionary movements which have</p>
<p begin="01:46:34.800" end="01:46:37.840" style="s2">con</p>
<p begin="01:46:35.119" end="01:46:39.040" style="s2">which basically uh you know experiments</p>
<p begin="01:46:37.840" end="01:46:41.440" style="s2">for what we&#39;re talking about all</p>
<p begin="01:46:39.040" end="01:46:44.719" style="s2">revolutionary movements have</p>
<p begin="01:46:41.440" end="01:46:46.480" style="s2">have uh you know failed they&#39;ve achieved</p>
<p begin="01:46:44.719" end="01:46:48.880" style="s2">revolution</p>
<p begin="01:46:46.480" end="01:46:51.440" style="s2">uh but then the old crap self-organized</p>
<p begin="01:46:48.880" end="01:46:52.880" style="s2">self-organized again like russia and</p>
<p begin="01:46:51.440" end="01:46:54.560" style="s2">and so on so how do you break out of</p>
<p begin="01:46:52.880" end="01:46:56.239" style="s2">that dynamic you know that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:46:54.560" end="01:46:58.560" style="s2">a fundamental issue that we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:46:56.239" end="01:47:01.360" style="s2">touched on uh</p>
<p begin="01:46:58.560" end="01:47:01.840" style="s2">and that&#39;s where i say i might have to</p>
<p begin="01:47:01.360" end="01:47:05.600" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="01:47:01.840" end="01:47:07.280" style="s2">um uh you know</p>
<p begin="01:47:05.600" end="01:47:08.639" style="s2">be a traitor to australia somewhere</p>
<p begin="01:47:07.280" end="01:47:10.960" style="s2">along the line because there might be</p>
<p begin="01:47:08.639" end="01:47:13.360" style="s2">forces</p>
<p begin="01:47:10.960" end="01:47:14.480" style="s2">well for me it is this this um and again</p>
<p begin="01:47:13.360" end="01:47:16.639" style="s2">i might be stuck into</p>
<p begin="01:47:14.480" end="01:47:18.320" style="s2">my own groove on my own record here but</p>
<p begin="01:47:16.639" end="01:47:21.920" style="s2">but the the</p>
<p begin="01:47:18.320" end="01:47:22.800" style="s2">i spent a lot of time working on</p>
<p begin="01:47:21.920" end="01:47:25.040" style="s2">creating more</p>
<p begin="01:47:22.800" end="01:47:26.159" style="s2">sustainable regenerative models at the</p>
<p begin="01:47:25.040" end="01:47:27.600" style="s2">community scale</p>
<p begin="01:47:26.159" end="01:47:30.480" style="s2">working with the ecovillage movement</p>
<p begin="01:47:27.600" end="01:47:31.760" style="s2">yeah that small scale and at some point</p>
<p begin="01:47:30.480" end="01:47:35.199" style="s2">realized that</p>
<p begin="01:47:31.760" end="01:47:38.560" style="s2">from the sort of whole systems design</p>
<p begin="01:47:35.199" end="01:47:40.159" style="s2">building synergy perspective</p>
<p begin="01:47:38.560" end="01:47:42.320" style="s2">those scales were actually not big</p>
<p begin="01:47:40.159" end="01:47:45.679" style="s2">enough to accommodate</p>
<p begin="01:47:42.320" end="01:47:48.560" style="s2">certain ways of meeting human need needs</p>
<p begin="01:47:45.679" end="01:47:49.280" style="s2">and that the regional scale made much</p>
<p begin="01:47:48.560" end="01:47:51.840" style="s2">more sense</p>
<p begin="01:47:49.280" end="01:47:54.080" style="s2">and was also much more aligned to the</p>
<p begin="01:47:51.840" end="01:47:56.159" style="s2">larger part of our species history</p>
<p begin="01:47:54.080" end="01:47:57.520" style="s2">um because the the sort of nation state</p>
<p begin="01:47:56.159" end="01:48:00.800" style="s2">as i alluded to earlier</p>
<p begin="01:47:57.520" end="01:48:04.000" style="s2">is really a relatively recent operation</p>
<p begin="01:48:00.800" end="01:48:06.800" style="s2">and and of course that is um</p>
<p begin="01:48:04.000" end="01:48:07.840" style="s2">kind of treasonous in some countries if</p>
<p begin="01:48:06.800" end="01:48:10.320" style="s2">you if you say</p>
<p begin="01:48:07.840" end="01:48:11.840" style="s2">um you know that&#39;s why david sloane</p>
<p begin="01:48:10.320" end="01:48:14.800" style="s2">wilson i think</p>
<p begin="01:48:11.840" end="01:48:16.400" style="s2">was not going to sign up to a you know a</p>
<p begin="01:48:14.800" end="01:48:17.360" style="s2">move to global governance because in</p>
<p begin="01:48:16.400" end="01:48:19.040" style="s2">america</p>
<p begin="01:48:17.360" end="01:48:20.480" style="s2">yeah they&#39;ll shoot you for that i mean</p>
<p begin="01:48:19.040" end="01:48:21.440" style="s2">it&#39;s worse than being a black man in</p>
<p begin="01:48:20.480" end="01:48:24.000" style="s2">america</p>
<p begin="01:48:21.440" end="01:48:25.520" style="s2">is you&#39;re more disadvantaged than if</p>
<p begin="01:48:24.000" end="01:48:27.199" style="s2">you&#39;re an african-american</p>
<p begin="01:48:25.520" end="01:48:29.119" style="s2">if you support global governance you</p>
<p begin="01:48:27.199" end="01:48:29.840" style="s2">know everyone will be united against you</p>
<p begin="01:48:29.119" end="01:48:32.960" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:48:29.840" end="01:48:37.360" style="s2">yeah yeah so for me yeah that</p>
<p begin="01:48:32.960" end="01:48:37.360" style="s2">there&#39;s just something in um</p>
<p begin="01:48:38.000" end="01:48:44.320" style="s2">learning from biological pattern that</p>
<p begin="01:48:41.920" end="01:48:46.000" style="s2">is exactly that rather than dominate the</p>
<p begin="01:48:44.320" end="01:48:47.840" style="s2">hierarchy&#39;s growth hierarchies</p>
<p begin="01:48:46.000" end="01:48:49.280" style="s2">enabling hierarchies with some</p>
<p begin="01:48:47.840" end="01:48:52.159" style="s2">coordination function which</p>
<p begin="01:48:49.280" end="01:48:52.560" style="s2">which you would call consequence capture</p>
<p begin="01:48:52.159" end="01:48:56.000" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:48:52.560" end="01:48:58.480" style="s2">that we need to re-build</p>
<p begin="01:48:56.000" end="01:49:00.000" style="s2">into our settlement patterns in our</p>
<p begin="01:48:58.480" end="01:49:02.080" style="s2">relationship with the wider</p>
<p begin="01:49:00.000" end="01:49:03.440" style="s2">context and part of that to my mind is</p>
<p begin="01:49:02.080" end="01:49:06.480" style="s2">also that letting go</p>
<p begin="01:49:03.440" end="01:49:08.320" style="s2">of being so speciesist and understanding</p>
<p begin="01:49:06.480" end="01:49:09.679" style="s2">that we have a key role to play that we</p>
<p begin="01:49:08.320" end="01:49:11.600" style="s2">can be um</p>
<p begin="01:49:09.679" end="01:49:12.960" style="s2">keystone species in the ecosystems that</p>
<p begin="01:49:11.600" end="01:49:16.080" style="s2">we inhabit in</p>
<p begin="01:49:12.960" end="01:49:18.000" style="s2">and do what life does best creating</p>
<p begin="01:49:16.080" end="01:49:20.400" style="s2">conditions conducive to life</p>
<p begin="01:49:18.000" end="01:49:22.000" style="s2">in those systems but that it that in</p>
<p begin="01:49:20.400" end="01:49:25.760" style="s2">order to have the feedback</p>
<p begin="01:49:22.000" end="01:49:27.920" style="s2">of our actions</p>
<p begin="01:49:25.760" end="01:49:29.280" style="s2">inform us quickly enough where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:49:27.920" end="01:49:32.480" style="s2">going off track</p>
<p begin="01:49:29.280" end="01:49:34.719" style="s2">it needs to be both scaled up</p>
<p begin="01:49:32.480" end="01:49:36.400" style="s2">and scaled down at the same time it like</p>
<p begin="01:49:34.719" end="01:49:39.360" style="s2">scale up our global awareness</p>
<p begin="01:49:36.400" end="01:49:41.360" style="s2">and coordination and cooperation and we</p>
<p begin="01:49:39.360" end="01:49:44.960" style="s2">actually need to redesign</p>
<p begin="01:49:41.360" end="01:49:48.400" style="s2">the patterns of meeting our needs</p>
<p begin="01:49:44.960" end="01:49:51.920" style="s2">at a much sub national level</p>
<p begin="01:49:48.400" end="01:49:56.400" style="s2">a regional level by regional level two</p>
<p begin="01:49:51.920" end="01:49:58.639" style="s2">two final points i&#39;d make then</p>
<p begin="01:49:56.400" end="01:49:58.639" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="01:50:00.400" end="01:50:03.920" style="s2">i don&#39;t know that i was trying i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:50:02.800" end="01:50:06.719" style="s2">getting tired</p>
<p begin="01:50:03.920" end="01:50:08.320" style="s2">um no so the general the technological</p>
<p begin="01:50:06.719" end="01:50:10.080" style="s2">one uh because you&#39;ve raised that a</p>
<p begin="01:50:08.320" end="01:50:13.440" style="s2">number of times and</p>
<p begin="01:50:10.080" end="01:50:17.360" style="s2">the so what i would say broadly is that</p>
<p begin="01:50:13.440" end="01:50:18.960" style="s2">the one thing one certain thing about</p>
<p begin="01:50:17.360" end="01:50:20.159" style="s2">complexity is you can&#39;t predict the</p>
<p begin="01:50:18.960" end="01:50:22.080" style="s2">future</p>
<p begin="01:50:20.159" end="01:50:24.239" style="s2">of everything impossible you know</p>
<p begin="01:50:22.080" end="01:50:26.719" style="s2">complex systems are unpredictable</p>
<p begin="01:50:24.239" end="01:50:27.440" style="s2">um like stuart kaufman for example says</p>
<p begin="01:50:26.719" end="01:50:30.480" style="s2">there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:50:27.440" end="01:50:33.280" style="s2">pre-stateable uh</p>
<p begin="01:50:30.480" end="01:50:33.840" style="s2">you know rules about how the future will</p>
<p begin="01:50:33.280" end="01:50:37.040" style="s2">unfold</p>
<p begin="01:50:33.840" end="01:50:38.080" style="s2">it&#39;s all unknown i don&#39;t go as far as</p>
<p begin="01:50:37.040" end="01:50:40.560" style="s2">that i say there are</p>
<p begin="01:50:38.080" end="01:50:43.360" style="s2">attractors you can identify attractors</p>
<p begin="01:50:40.560" end="01:50:45.280" style="s2">so an attractor is the global</p>
<p begin="01:50:43.360" end="01:50:46.800" style="s2">uh the you know the global super</p>
<p begin="01:50:45.280" end="01:50:48.239" style="s2">organism the hatching</p>
<p begin="01:50:46.800" end="01:50:49.679" style="s2">of what this whole process has been</p>
<p begin="01:50:48.239" end="01:50:50.960" style="s2">headed towards the hatching of global</p>
<p begin="01:50:49.679" end="01:50:52.800" style="s2">super organism</p>
<p begin="01:50:50.960" end="01:50:55.199" style="s2">isn&#39;t a tractor so you can predict that</p>
<p begin="01:50:52.800" end="01:50:58.320" style="s2">any planet that survives where</p>
<p begin="01:50:55.199" end="01:51:00.719" style="s2">life survives and flourishes there will</p>
<p begin="01:50:58.320" end="01:51:04.080" style="s2">be global governance and there will be</p>
<p begin="01:51:00.719" end="01:51:05.840" style="s2">you know a global cooperative system but</p>
<p begin="01:51:04.080" end="01:51:07.119" style="s2">the detail of how to get there is</p>
<p begin="01:51:05.840" end="01:51:09.119" style="s2">unpredictable</p>
<p begin="01:51:07.119" end="01:51:12.000" style="s2">so the most that has really important</p>
<p begin="01:51:09.119" end="01:51:14.000" style="s2">consequences for the systems you set up</p>
<p begin="01:51:12.000" end="01:51:16.159" style="s2">that you don&#39;t try and design the future</p>
<p begin="01:51:14.000" end="01:51:18.719" style="s2">and you know in terms of mental models</p>
<p begin="01:51:16.159" end="01:51:20.719" style="s2">predicting the detail the best you can</p>
<p begin="01:51:18.719" end="01:51:24.719" style="s2">do is set up systems</p>
<p begin="01:51:20.719" end="01:51:28.239" style="s2">that select uh and evolve</p>
<p begin="01:51:24.719" end="01:51:32.320" style="s2">in the right directions so they</p>
<p begin="01:51:28.239" end="01:51:35.440" style="s2">they work by um</p>
<p begin="01:51:32.320" end="01:51:38.719" style="s2">there&#39;s no predetermined you know</p>
<p begin="01:51:35.440" end="01:51:41.520" style="s2">ironclad plan there is instead</p>
<p begin="01:51:38.719" end="01:51:42.800" style="s2">the setting up of complex systems which</p>
<p begin="01:51:41.520" end="01:51:45.520" style="s2">develop and adapt</p>
<p begin="01:51:42.800" end="01:51:48.480" style="s2">and evolve those plans so what that</p>
<p begin="01:51:45.520" end="01:51:51.760" style="s2">means is to be more specific is</p>
<p begin="01:51:48.480" end="01:51:53.199" style="s2">you can&#39;t a priority work out what the</p>
<p begin="01:51:51.760" end="01:51:57.040" style="s2">role of technology will be</p>
<p begin="01:51:53.199" end="01:51:58.960" style="s2">relative to the role of the ecosystem</p>
<p begin="01:51:57.040" end="01:52:02.560" style="s2">um you don&#39;t know which parts of the</p>
<p begin="01:51:58.960" end="01:52:04.000" style="s2">ecosystem are scaffolding that have</p>
<p begin="01:52:02.560" end="01:52:06.400" style="s2">fulfilled their purpose and can be</p>
<p begin="01:52:04.000" end="01:52:08.000" style="s2">dropped you can&#39;t do that any more than</p>
<p begin="01:52:06.400" end="01:52:09.599" style="s2">you can say</p>
<p begin="01:52:08.000" end="01:52:11.119" style="s2">you know that there will be some new</p>
<p begin="01:52:09.599" end="01:52:13.199" style="s2">technology that we should focus on that</p>
<p begin="01:52:11.119" end="01:52:16.560" style="s2">will solve all our problems</p>
<p begin="01:52:13.199" end="01:52:18.480" style="s2">you have to but on that basis maybe</p>
<p begin="01:52:16.560" end="01:52:21.040" style="s2">large parts of our technologies are the</p>
<p begin="01:52:18.480" end="01:52:25.280" style="s2">extra</p>
<p begin="01:52:21.040" end="01:52:27.280" style="s2">are the eggshell exactly</p>
<p begin="01:52:25.280" end="01:52:29.840" style="s2">technology the fact that we can talk and</p>
<p begin="01:52:27.280" end="01:52:30.639" style="s2">have this kind of level of conversation</p>
<p begin="01:52:29.840" end="01:52:33.520" style="s2">across</p>
<p begin="01:52:30.639" end="01:52:34.719" style="s2">basically spanning the globe literally</p>
<p begin="01:52:33.520" end="01:52:37.840" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:52:34.719" end="01:52:38.719" style="s2">yeah i&#39;d say 90 of of where technology&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:52:37.840" end="01:52:40.400" style="s2">gone</p>
<p begin="01:52:38.719" end="01:52:43.280" style="s2">is what i refer to as simply the</p>
<p begin="01:52:40.400" end="01:52:46.560" style="s2">masturbation of stone age desires</p>
<p begin="01:52:43.280" end="01:52:47.280" style="s2">so it&#39;s satisfying human desires which</p>
<p begin="01:52:46.560" end="01:52:48.719" style="s2">came</p>
<p begin="01:52:47.280" end="01:52:50.400" style="s2">which were fixed at one point in our</p>
<p begin="01:52:48.719" end="01:52:53.520" style="s2">evolutionary history</p>
<p begin="01:52:50.400" end="01:52:56.000" style="s2">that served little purpose now uh and</p>
<p begin="01:52:53.520" end="01:52:57.920" style="s2">the developing the using of oil the yolk</p>
<p begin="01:52:56.000" end="01:52:59.280" style="s2">to produce you know all these structures</p>
<p begin="01:52:57.920" end="01:53:01.760" style="s2">of buildings and</p>
<p begin="01:52:59.280" end="01:53:03.199" style="s2">institutions and everything else to make</p>
<p begin="01:53:01.760" end="01:53:06.800" style="s2">people happy</p>
<p begin="01:53:03.199" end="01:53:09.920" style="s2">well you know humans being happy is</p>
<p begin="01:53:06.800" end="01:53:11.280" style="s2">not the you know what won&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:53:09.920" end="01:53:13.520" style="s2">lead to the emergence of the super</p>
