<p begin="00:00:03.419" end="00:00:10.170" style="s2">one today I feel like trying to make a</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.400" end="00:00:12.120" style="s2">bigger move Lucic to say to do something</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.170" end="00:00:15.210" style="s2">which requires already having a couple</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.120" end="00:00:18.480" style="s2">of the other concepts in place so today</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.210" end="00:00:22.580" style="s2">I will be importing concepts of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.480" end="00:00:28.529" style="s2">complicated the complex that&#39;s episode 2</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.580" end="00:00:29.939" style="s2">and to a lesser extent some of the other</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.529" end="00:00:32.669" style="s2">concepts that you can find in my</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.939" end="00:00:35.190" style="s2">immediate posts I&#39;ll try to keep that</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.669" end="00:00:37.620" style="s2">relatively light but if you haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.190" end="00:00:39.300" style="s2">really read and understood the concepts</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.620" end="00:00:42.899" style="s2">the complicated complex and the kinetic</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.300" end="00:00:44.670" style="s2">model you might want to do that first so</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.899" end="00:00:46.079" style="s2">we&#39;ll be talking about today is</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.670" end="00:00:50.280" style="s2">something that I referred to as the</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.079" end="00:00:52.920" style="s2">Tainter plus model this is a extension</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.280" end="00:00:54.840" style="s2">or an effort to be an extension of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.920" end="00:01:00.059" style="s2">model that was put forward by Joseph</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.840" end="00:01:01.829" style="s2">Tainter I should point out that painter</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.059" end="00:01:03.270" style="s2">has no idea what I&#39;m doing here and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.829" end="00:01:07.140" style="s2">this is not something that he has any</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.270" end="00:01:10.409" style="s2">particular endorsement of so by ordinary</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.140" end="00:01:12.299" style="s2">deep code rules if any of this sounds</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.409" end="00:01:15.500" style="s2">good or interesting then you should have</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.299" end="00:01:17.880" style="s2">seen this entire the kids and it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.500" end="00:01:21.210" style="s2">bad foolish you should assume that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.880" end="00:01:25.140" style="s2">entirely minor or ours all right so with</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.210" end="00:01:26.759" style="s2">that caveat this idea requires a little</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.140" end="00:01:28.470" style="s2">bit of exposition so it might take</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.759" end="00:01:30.869" style="s2">longer than usual I hope you bear with</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.470" end="00:01:33.390" style="s2">me but I do actually think it&#39;s more the</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.869" end="00:01:36.240" style="s2">more interesting and incisive concepts</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.390" end="00:01:41.659" style="s2">that&#39;s out there it begins with the</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.240" end="00:01:46.070" style="s2">observation of the fact that the way we</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.659" end="00:01:49.549" style="s2">humans so far in civilization typically</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.070" end="00:01:51.960" style="s2">get what we need from the complex</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.549" end="00:01:56.790" style="s2">natural world which is to say the way</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.960" end="00:02:01.820" style="s2">that we access and make use of resources</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.790" end="00:02:05.040" style="s2">of complex nature is that we innovate</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.820" end="00:02:09.810" style="s2">construct and manage complicated</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.040" end="00:02:11.730" style="s2">structures to do it and we might say</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.810" end="00:02:12.930" style="s2">that the the Tainter plus model is an</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.730" end="00:02:16.230" style="s2">observation</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.930" end="00:02:19.189" style="s2">how this dynamic seems to continually</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.230" end="00:02:21.769" style="s2">play out I&#39;m going to use a particular</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.189" end="00:02:27.359" style="s2">metaphor throughout the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.769" end="00:02:29.579" style="s2">which is the oil system the oil industry</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.359" end="00:02:32.549" style="s2">of the oil economy excetera is an</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.579" end="00:02:34.560" style="s2">example of a complicated system and oil</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.549" end="00:02:39.659" style="s2">in this case being a complex natural</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.560" end="00:02:41.849" style="s2">resource so it begins with the discovery</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.659" end="00:02:43.680" style="s2">of a possibility of an opportunity you</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.849" end="00:02:46.409" style="s2">already have some kind of social</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.680" end="00:02:48.900" style="s2">environment that is more or less getting</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.409" end="00:02:52.169" style="s2">its needs met and you come across some</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.900" end="00:02:56.639" style="s2">capability of accessing some useful</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.169" end="00:02:59.159" style="s2">resource that can add value to your</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.639" end="00:03:02.700" style="s2">social environment so it is discovered</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.159" end="00:03:05.790" style="s2">that oil can be used safe for example</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.700" end="00:03:07.829" style="s2">for energy I&#39;m going to simplify the</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.790" end="00:03:09.359" style="s2">example arrived I know that petroleum</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.829" end="00:03:11.030" style="s2">has lots and lots of different uses and</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.359" end="00:03:14.519" style="s2">I don&#39;t know the exact history perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.030" end="00:03:15.689" style="s2">so let&#39;s just imagine that it&#39;s a route</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.519" end="00:03:20.310" style="s2">of origin the story starts with energy</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.689" end="00:03:21.359" style="s2">in the beginning you don&#39;t really need</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.310" end="00:03:22.440" style="s2">it anywhere you&#39;ve already got the</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.359" end="00:03:24.569" style="s2">energy sources that you need your</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.440" end="00:03:26.069" style="s2">society it&#39;s not built around access to</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.569" end="00:03:28.919" style="s2">the meat and well just discover people</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.069" end="00:03:31.290" style="s2">to do that so it&#39;s all upside and in</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.919" end="00:03:33.419" style="s2">fact it&#39;s generally almost by definition</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.290" end="00:03:34.739" style="s2">relatively easy to cat because otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.419" end="00:03:36.389" style="s2">you didn&#39;t spend any time looking for</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.739" end="00:03:39.269" style="s2">it&#39;s not something that&#39;s currently</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.389" end="00:03:42.150" style="s2">deeply deeply valuable so let&#39;s say you</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.269" end="00:03:44.459" style="s2">can go out with a shovel to some fields</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.150" end="00:03:45.870" style="s2">and dig up some sand and through some</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.459" end="00:03:48.540" style="s2">relatively simple process have yourself</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.870" end="00:03:51.449" style="s2">a barrel of oil and then you can use it</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.540" end="00:03:55.139" style="s2">for running lamps or lubricating axles</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.449" end="00:03:57.269" style="s2">or whatnot and the energy return is</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.139" end="00:03:59.269" style="s2">quite substantial compared to the energy</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.269" end="00:04:02.729" style="s2">investment let&#39;s say maybe you get a</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.269" end="00:04:04.979" style="s2">hundred barrels of oil of useful value</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.729" end="00:04:07.409" style="s2">for the equivalent of one barrel of oil</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.979" end="00:04:10.409" style="s2">of energy expended because there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.409" end="00:04:12.689" style="s2">a lot of low-hanging fruit this space of</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.409" end="00:04:14.639" style="s2">resource has not been yet meaningfully</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.689" end="00:04:15.989" style="s2">explored and for some reason you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.639" end="00:04:20.370" style="s2">entered into the possibility of getting</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.989" end="00:04:23.259" style="s2">there and so it began</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.370" end="00:04:25.720" style="s2">what happens here is that because the</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.259" end="00:04:28.300" style="s2">the resource shows up is that not being</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.720" end="00:04:30.280" style="s2">useful and in fact because of the ratio</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.300" end="00:04:35.110" style="s2">between energy expenditure net returned</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.280" end="00:04:37.990" style="s2">it shows it as being attractive more</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.110" end="00:04:40.120" style="s2">people begin to spend more time getting</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.990" end="00:04:41.830" style="s2">it using it and as a consequence it</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.120" end="00:04:43.900" style="s2">begins to add value to the social</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.830" end="00:04:47.289" style="s2">infrastructure the possibilities become</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.900" end="00:04:50.949" style="s2">actualities and it becomes useful and</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.289" end="00:04:54.940" style="s2">interesting to build more things on this</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.949" end="00:04:57.610" style="s2">foundation you might for example begin</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.940" end="00:05:00.699" style="s2">to innovate things that require the use</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.610" end="00:05:03.090" style="s2">of oil so you debate the internal</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.699" end="00:05:05.710" style="s2">combustion engine and this gives rise to</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.090" end="00:05:08.199" style="s2">airplanes and to shifting farmers</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.710" end="00:05:10.150" style="s2">feeding double oil or to a motive</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.199" end="00:05:14.349" style="s2">industries I&#39;m in a fashion if stiff the</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.150" end="00:05:16.539" style="s2">wooden existed before and so on the one</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.349" end="00:05:18.580" style="s2">hand you see is an expansion of social</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.539" end="00:05:23.490" style="s2">capability not on the basis of this new</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.580" end="00:05:26.620" style="s2">bathing&#39;s new reservoir of potential on</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.490" end="00:05:30.970" style="s2">the other hand what you begin to see</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.620" end="00:05:33.760" style="s2">also is that the low-hanging fruit get</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.970" end="00:05:36.729" style="s2">picked relatively quickly and you find</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.760" end="00:05:40.300" style="s2">it becomes a little bit harder to access</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.729" end="00:05:41.500" style="s2">the underlying resource so now instead</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.300" end="00:05:43.000" style="s2">of being able to just kind of dig it up</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.500" end="00:05:46.449" style="s2">with a shovel you have to actually build</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.000" end="00:05:48.460" style="s2">some kind of structure and maybe because</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.449" end="00:05:51.250" style="s2">it&#39;s being used more broadly you also</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.460" end="00:05:53.620" style="s2">have to build ways of distributing it</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.250" end="00:05:55.720" style="s2">more broadly and perhaps if the use</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.620" end="00:05:57.400" style="s2">cases are in fact more diverse gifted</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.720" end="00:06:00.009" style="s2">actually start in certain processing</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.400" end="00:06:02.050" style="s2">mechanisms to pull out the distillates</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.009" end="00:06:05.490" style="s2">and to convert into plastics and whatnot</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.050" end="00:06:09.180" style="s2">and so it as if happening is in order to</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.490" end="00:06:12.159" style="s2">take advantage of the increasing</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.180" end="00:06:14.560" style="s2">possibilities in order to maintain an</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.159" end="00:06:18.669" style="s2">increasing demand you have to increase</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.560" end="00:06:21.820" style="s2">your intensity of extraction what is</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.669" end="00:06:23.919" style="s2">becoming a more challenging to extract</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.820" end="00:06:26.050" style="s2">process and distribute resource which</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.919" end="00:06:28.570" style="s2">means you end up having to build a more</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.050" end="00:06:35.490" style="s2">complicated structure to do all this</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.570" end="00:06:35.490" style="s2">work that&#39;s the major move</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.520" end="00:06:43.750" style="s2">and there are a couple of consequences</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.850" end="00:06:46.570" style="s2">to this one which I think it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.750" end="00:06:49.390" style="s2">to note up front is that as far as I can</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.570" end="00:06:54.480" style="s2">tell any interaction of the complicated</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.390" end="00:06:58.690" style="s2">of the complex will result in some</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.480" end="00:07:02.740" style="s2">externality to the complex some waste</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.690" end="00:07:04.900" style="s2">product or some disruption to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.740" end="00:07:07.540" style="s2">homeostatic feedback loops that maintain</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.900" end="00:07:09.550" style="s2">the integrity to complex system so in</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.540" end="00:07:11.950" style="s2">this case for example and the minimum</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.550" end="00:07:13.330" style="s2">you are going to be destroying the</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.950" end="00:07:16.210" style="s2">physical environment where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.330" end="00:07:17.650" style="s2">extracting oil and at least in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.210" end="00:07:20.050" style="s2">narrowband air like the ground is no</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.650" end="00:07:22.540" style="s2">longer what it used to be and of course</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.050" end="00:07:25.120" style="s2">you see broader consequences at the</p>

<p begin="00:08:21.280" end="00:08:26.560" style="s2">involved you can imagine that you have</p>

<p begin="00:08:41.290" end="00:08:46.220" style="s2">of time you get a whole lot of carrying</p>

<p begin="00:08:46.220" end="00:08:52.529" style="s2">so then we get to the the next move</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.779" end="00:08:55.860" style="s2">would be the ratio of energy returned</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.529" end="00:08:58.829" style="s2">for an energy expended goes through a</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.860" end="00:09:01.139" style="s2">curve in the beginning you&#39;ll see a</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.829" end="00:09:05.610" style="s2">situation where the ability to get</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.139" end="00:09:07.649" style="s2">better at doing it pays dividends and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.610" end="00:09:10.769" style="s2">as you&#39;re becoming more complicated</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.649" end="00:09:12.899" style="s2">you&#39;re actually also becoming more</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.769" end="00:09:15.089" style="s2">efficient so maybe ratio goes from one</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.899" end="00:09:16.980" style="s2">pair with ten barrels of energy returned</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.089" end="00:09:19.709" style="s2">from one barrel energy expended to a</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.980" end="00:09:21.660" style="s2">hundred to one because you just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.709" end="00:09:23.279" style="s2">pick the low-hanging fruit in what you</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.660" end="00:09:24.809" style="s2">might call innovation space not the</p>

<p begin="00:09:24.809" end="00:09:28.800" style="s2">oil but the low-hanging fruit and</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.430" end="00:09:31.410" style="s2">getting better at finding the oil and</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.800" end="00:09:36.449" style="s2">this is the classic acceleration part of</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.410" end="00:09:38.279" style="s2">an innovation s-curve and so this has by</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.449" end="00:09:39.269" style="s2">the way the consequence of making you</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.279" end="00:09:41.339" style="s2">want to double down if you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.269" end="00:09:44.449" style="s2">getting better and better better so keep</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.339" end="00:09:47.129" style="s2">doing it extend up until you build out</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.449" end="00:09:49.259" style="s2">but at a certain point there&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.129" end="00:09:52.410" style="s2">be a tipping point where the low-hanging</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.259" end="00:09:55.350" style="s2">fruit in innovation space and sound</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.410" end="00:10:01.410" style="s2">start to get harder to get and so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.350" end="00:10:04.019" style="s2">now spending more and more to get the</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.410" end="00:10:06.089" style="s2">same amount or even a declining amount</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.019" end="00:10:08.399" style="s2">of innovation which is still shown</p>

<p begin="00:10:19.850" end="00:10:28.889" style="s2">you&#39;re spending a barrel of oil to get</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.610" end="00:10:31.620" style="s2">innovation that say increases your rate</p>

<p begin="00:10:31.620" end="00:10:36.809" style="s2">by 10% and then in the next year it only</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.949" end="00:10:39.959" style="s2">increases your rate of return in oil by</p>

<p begin="00:10:42.600" end="00:10:44.939" style="s2">now it&#39;s happening is you&#39;re getting</p>

<p begin="00:10:44.939" end="00:10:50.339" style="s2">means the top is coming but at the same</p>

<p begin="00:11:13.620" end="00:11:19.530" style="s2">have an entire transportation sector</p>

<p begin="00:17:28.459" end="00:17:33.110" style="s2">to keep in mind obviously I&#39;ve mentioned</p>

<p begin="00:17:36.110" end="00:17:42.340" style="s2">and the fact that innovation has its own</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.920" end="00:17:44.480" style="s2">decreasing returns in particular domains</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.340" end="00:17:46.910" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting about this is that it</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.480" end="00:17:48.770" style="s2">actually is domain specific that once</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.910" end="00:17:50.980" style="s2">you&#39;ve created a bounded complicated</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.770" end="00:17:55.280" style="s2">domain the complicated is by definition</p>

<p begin="00:17:57.670" end="00:18:02.000" style="s2">then the less that territory is finite</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.260" end="00:18:04.310" style="s2">and this is one of the primary reasons</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.000" end="00:18:04.880" style="s2">why you get decreasing returns to</p>
