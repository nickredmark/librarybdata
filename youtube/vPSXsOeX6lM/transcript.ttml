<p begin="00:01:30.299" end="00:01:35.189" style="s2">his experience of going to live with the</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.490" end="00:01:38.159" style="s2">Pueblo Indians and how it completely</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.189" end="00:01:41.100" style="s2">just blew apart his conception of what</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.159" end="00:01:43.440" style="s2">was natural and how the Western world</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.100" end="00:01:47.280" style="s2">view is different from other worldviews</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.440" end="00:01:50.340" style="s2">and he noticed that they were so happy</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.280" end="00:01:52.080" style="s2">and serene and they felt themselves as</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.340" end="00:01:53.640" style="s2">one with their environment and they had</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.080" end="00:01:55.590" style="s2">this very special relationship with the</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.640" end="00:01:57.690" style="s2">Sun and it was just it was very</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.590" end="00:01:59.729" style="s2">beautiful but at the same time he</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.690" end="00:02:02.970" style="s2">realized how they were very vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.729" end="00:02:05.340" style="s2">to you know the invasion of the Western</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.970" end="00:02:07.319" style="s2">civilization so if we create a new</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.340" end="00:02:09.750" style="s2">civilization operating system that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.319" end="00:02:11.489" style="s2">not oriented towards winning wars then</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.750" end="00:02:14.280" style="s2">how do we ensure that it doesn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.489" end="00:02:15.959" style="s2">destroyed by those who are imagine</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.280" end="00:02:18.270" style="s2">there&#39;s a group of people that get a</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.959" end="00:02:21.360" style="s2">stronger theory of causation so they</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.270" end="00:02:23.250" style="s2">learn Newton&#39;s physics and so now they</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.360" end="00:02:24.480" style="s2">can use calculus to plot a ballistic</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.250" end="00:02:26.220" style="s2">curve and make the cannon ball hit the</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.480" end="00:02:27.750" style="s2">right spot every time rather than the</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.220" end="00:02:30.090" style="s2">pendulum dowsing which is kind of a hit</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.750" end="00:02:32.250" style="s2">or miss that belief is going to catch on</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.090" end="00:02:33.900" style="s2">and that&#39;s why science really caught on</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.250" end="00:02:36.510" style="s2">took us out of the Dark Ages was because</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.900" end="00:02:38.099" style="s2">it led to better weapons and better</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.510" end="00:02:39.660" style="s2">agriculture tech and better like real</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.099" end="00:02:41.849" style="s2"> so it proliferated because it was</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.660" end="00:02:43.650" style="s2">proliferative if we increased our theory</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.849" end="00:02:46.800" style="s2">of causation that ends up catching on</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.650" end="00:02:48.750" style="s2">but if we could increase our theory of</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.800" end="00:02:50.250" style="s2">causation and our theory of choice and</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.750" end="00:02:52.349" style="s2">the relationship between them that would</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.250" end="00:02:54.090" style="s2">actually be the most adaptive especially</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.349" end="00:02:57.569" style="s2">in the presence of where a particular</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.090" end="00:02:59.190" style="s2">game theoretic model of choice with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.569" end="00:03:00.900" style="s2">extension of causation we have is</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.190" end="00:03:03.810" style="s2">definitely self terminating definitely</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.900" end="00:03:05.489" style="s2">anti adaptive and so I know we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.810" end="00:03:07.260" style="s2">on for a long time so there&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.489" end="00:03:09.150" style="s2">only one more thing that I want to share</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.260" end="00:03:12.499" style="s2">that kind of closes this set of concepts</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.150" end="00:03:14.459" style="s2">so remember we said that any source of</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.499" end="00:03:17.040" style="s2">asymmetric advantage competitive</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.459" end="00:03:19.260" style="s2">advantage in a win-lose game will end up</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.040" end="00:03:20.819" style="s2">once it&#39;s deployed being figured out in</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.260" end="00:03:24.090" style="s2">utilized by everybody you just up the</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.819" end="00:03:26.459" style="s2">level of fancy and playing field so but</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.090" end="00:03:27.720" style="s2">we also said the Indians you were just</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.459" end="00:03:31.349" style="s2">mentioning and many of the treasures</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.720" end="00:03:33.239" style="s2">we&#39;ve mentioned lost win lose games we</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.349" end="00:03:35.129" style="s2">don&#39;t want to try and build something</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.239" end="00:03:37.920" style="s2">that&#39;s just going to lose at a win-lose</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.129" end="00:03:39.599" style="s2">game but we know that if it tries to win</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.920" end="00:03:41.129" style="s2">at win-lose games it&#39;s just still part</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.599" end="00:03:44.849" style="s2">of the same existential curve that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.129" end="00:03:47.190" style="s2">on so it has to not lose at a win-lose</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.849" end="00:03:49.170" style="s2">game while also not seeking to win but</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.190" end="00:03:51.120" style="s2">do it so it&#39;s basically not playing the</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.170" end="00:03:53.579" style="s2">game but it is oriented about how not to</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.120" end="00:03:57.870" style="s2">lose this is a very important thing and</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.579" end="00:03:59.250" style="s2">so we can think about power the way we</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.870" end="00:04:02.069" style="s2">have traditionally thought of power is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.250" end="00:04:04.140" style="s2">power over or power against type dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.069" end="00:04:06.329" style="s2">a game theoretic win-lose dynamic and</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.140" end="00:04:07.709" style="s2">that that any agent that deploys a</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.329" end="00:04:09.569" style="s2">particular kind of power leads to other</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.709" end="00:04:11.609" style="s2">agents for you on how to deploy the same</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.569" end="00:04:13.769" style="s2">and other kinds of powered power keeps</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.609" end="00:04:15.269" style="s2">it anting up till we get to problems but</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.769" end="00:04:17.160" style="s2">we could think about another term we</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.269" end="00:04:19.169" style="s2">might call strength which is not the</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.160" end="00:04:21.150" style="s2">power to beat someone else but it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.169" end="00:04:23.340" style="s2">ability to not be beat by someone else</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.150" end="00:04:25.320" style="s2">it&#39;s the ability to maintain our own</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.340" end="00:04:28.500" style="s2">sovereignty and our own coherence in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.320" end="00:04:29.910" style="s2">presence of outside forces and so we can</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.500" end="00:04:31.830" style="s2">talk about my power like can I go beat</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.910" end="00:04:36.870" style="s2">somebody up but my strength is can my</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.830" end="00:04:38.639" style="s2">body fend off viruses and can I fend off</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.870" end="00:04:40.260" style="s2">cancers and can I actually protect</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.639" end="00:04:41.340" style="s2">myself if I need to protect myself which</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.260" end="00:04:44.760" style="s2">is different than can I go beat other</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.340" end="00:04:47.130" style="s2">people up and now the power game is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.760" end="00:04:48.990" style="s2">game we actually have to cure power over</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.130" end="00:04:50.820" style="s2">dynamics mean rivalry sign AMEX mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.990" end="00:04:52.770" style="s2">when loose dynamics is the source of</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.820" end="00:04:54.840" style="s2">evil it&#39;s not that money is the source</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.770" end="00:04:58.530" style="s2">of evil it&#39;s that power over where I</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.840" end="00:05:00.660" style="s2">think my well-being is ante coupled to</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.530" end="00:05:02.310" style="s2">yours ends up being the source of evil</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.660" end="00:05:04.979" style="s2">and money&#39;s just very deep in the stack</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.310" end="00:05:07.020" style="s2">of power dynamics but statuses and</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.979" end="00:05:08.550" style="s2">certain ways of relating to sex and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.020" end="00:05:10.289" style="s2">number of things are so we have to get</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.550" end="00:05:11.490" style="s2">rid of the power over dynamics but it</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.289" end="00:05:14.130" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that I can&#39;t develop</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.490" end="00:05:16.889" style="s2">strength that makes me anti fragile in</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.130" end="00:05:19.500" style="s2">the presence of rivalry and then I say</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.889" end="00:05:21.419" style="s2">well what kind of capacity can I</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.500" end="00:05:23.789" style="s2">developed it doesn&#39;t get weaponized by</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.419" end="00:05:25.950" style="s2">somebody else and used against me given</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.789" end="00:05:26.640" style="s2">that any asymmetric capacity I get can</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.950" end="00:05:29.039" style="s2">be weaponized</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.640" end="00:05:30.389" style="s2">there&#39;s really only one and this is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.039" end="00:05:34.620" style="s2">really interesting thing</p>

<p begin="00:22:54.049" end="00:22:59.480" style="s2">okay I wasn&#39;t thinking about rival risk</p>

<p begin="00:23:21.880" end="00:23:26.320" style="s2">things that are wrong wrong what is</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.680" end="00:23:28.090" style="s2">going on and then go deeper keep going</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.320" end="00:23:29.320" style="s2">deeper with that and don&#39;t look for one</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.090" end="00:23:31.390" style="s2">answer are there a number of different</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.320" end="00:23:33.490" style="s2">things that come together that are</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.390" end="00:23:36.610" style="s2">partial answers to this and what would</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.490" end="00:23:38.230" style="s2">solving that look like and there are</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.610" end="00:23:39.970" style="s2">resources of other people&#39;s thinking on</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.230" end="00:23:42.160" style="s2">these things but they won&#39;t replace they</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.970" end="00:23:43.780" style="s2">will inspire they won&#39;t replace your own</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.160" end="00:23:45.940" style="s2">deep thinking on these things for your</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.780" end="00:23:49.210" style="s2">own sense making and so the resource</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.940" end="00:23:51.550" style="s2">that I would offer the most is when you</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.210" end="00:23:54.070" style="s2">are bothered by something where you wish</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.550" end="00:23:55.900" style="s2">some beautiful thing existed more than</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.070" end="00:23:58.330" style="s2">it does really think hard about why</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.900" end="00:23:59.920" style="s2">things are the way they are and know</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.330" end="00:24:02.200" style="s2">that the first thought you will come up</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.920" end="00:24:04.360" style="s2">with are not that good but if you stop</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.200" end="00:24:05.710" style="s2">you won&#39;t get beyond there but if you</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.360" end="00:24:07.540" style="s2">really keep working on and thinking</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.710" end="00:24:09.760" style="s2">about it and then going and researching</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.540" end="00:24:11.020" style="s2">in light of that question and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.760" end="00:24:13.390" style="s2">thinking about it more you actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.020" end="00:24:15.730" style="s2">start to get novel and meaningful and</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.390" end="00:24:17.590" style="s2">deeper sense making that is aligned with</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.730" end="00:24:20.140" style="s2">what is yours to pay attention to a</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.590" end="00:24:23.380" style="s2">marker to relate to what you said</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.140" end="00:24:26.290" style="s2">earlier I think it really helps to use</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.380" end="00:24:28.390" style="s2">different modes of inquiry people can</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.290" end="00:24:32.080" style="s2">get stuck in just intellectual enquiry</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.390" end="00:24:34.600" style="s2">or just spiritual inquiry but you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.080" end="00:24:36.340" style="s2">all are valuable and when we can see the</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.600" end="00:24:38.530" style="s2">same thing from several different</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.340" end="00:24:41.260" style="s2">perspectives it becomes a 3d object</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.530" end="00:24:43.600" style="s2">rather than just being flat you just</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.260" end="00:24:46.840" style="s2">actually mentioned one of my favorite</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.600" end="00:24:48.490" style="s2">practices is really endeavoring to see</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.840" end="00:24:51.720" style="s2">and experience the world through the</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.490" end="00:24:54.160" style="s2">perspective of someone else and actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.720" end="00:24:56.290" style="s2">see and experience it and if I&#39;m still</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.160" end="00:24:57.820" style="s2">thinking no if I was in their position I</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.290" end="00:24:59.710" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t do that I haven&#39;t got it yet so</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.820" end="00:25:01.270" style="s2">I was in that position would be if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.710" end="00:25:02.740" style="s2">really putting myself in a position I</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.270" end="00:25:04.420" style="s2">would get enraged by the things they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.740" end="00:25:06.490" style="s2">enraged by I would get excited by the</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.420" end="00:25:09.580" style="s2">things are excited by and so this both</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.490" end="00:25:11.980" style="s2">has a practice of empathy in connection</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.580" end="00:25:13.750" style="s2">as a practice of understanding as a</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.980" end="00:25:15.610" style="s2">practice of intelligence and learning</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.750" end="00:25:17.170" style="s2">because I see different things if I look</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.610" end="00:25:18.730" style="s2">at the world through the lens of a</p>

<p begin="00:25:22.450" end="00:25:25.390" style="s2">than if you look through the lens of a</p>

<p begin="00:25:38.750" end="00:25:42.980" style="s2">of spiritual technology of getting out</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.910" end="00:25:45.470" style="s2">of the default mode of what you think</p>

<p begin="00:26:00.140" end="00:26:03.500" style="s2">personality and then I get some more</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.940" end="00:26:06.830" style="s2">spaciousness around it and less reactive</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.500" end="00:26:08.300" style="s2">by it and this also relates to not just</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.830" end="00:26:10.340" style="s2">looking through the lens of different</p>

<p begin="00:26:17.240" end="00:26:20.990" style="s2">very useful as well because if we look</p>

<p begin="00:34:51.429" end="00:34:56.619" style="s2">itself which is why in a utilitarian and</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.730" end="00:34:57.820" style="s2">instrumental dynamic we&#39;re getting ahead</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.619" end="00:35:00.099" style="s2">while feeling utterly</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.820" end="00:35:02.680" style="s2">meaningless and destroying everything</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.099" end="00:35:06.310" style="s2">that is meaningful in the process that</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.680" end="00:35:08.589" style="s2">is us being hooked to addiction to a</p>

<p begin="00:35:13.839" end="00:35:19.359" style="s2">Omni stupid thing and this is why you</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.780" end="00:35:21.160" style="s2">know like the the Hindu concept of</p>

<p begin="00:35:21.160" end="00:35:26.140" style="s2">utilitarian ethic and and there was a</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.410" end="00:35:28.630" style="s2">very meaningful set of concepts if do</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.140" end="00:35:31.599" style="s2">what is inherently right in your</p>

<p begin="00:35:34.300" end="00:35:37.510" style="s2">outcome is gonna be and if you try and</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.220" end="00:35:39.130" style="s2">just figure out the outcome is gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.510" end="00:35:40.660" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna be wrong a lot of times and</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.130" end="00:35:44.320" style="s2">you&#39;re also gonna justify a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.660" end="00:35:46.960" style="s2">unethical styles and utilitarianism is</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.320" end="00:35:48.220" style="s2">kind of the rampant ethics that anyone</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.960" end="00:35:49.690" style="s2">who&#39;s paying attention to ethics pays</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.220" end="00:35:52.420" style="s2">attention to right now and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.690" end="00:35:54.580" style="s2">without any merit but it is also</p>

<p begin="00:35:58.900" end="00:36:03.220" style="s2">a problematic thing to be the dominant</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.970" end="00:36:04.869" style="s2">system because we cannot actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.220" end="00:36:07.800" style="s2">predict and complex systems well enough</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.869" end="00:36:11.560" style="s2">to do a utilitarian thing and they</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.800" end="00:36:13.750" style="s2">intrinsic dynamics of a relationship and</p>

<p begin="00:36:17.130" end="00:36:22.990" style="s2">and as soon as I start factoring</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.650" end="00:36:24.730" style="s2">everything meaningful along the chain of</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.990" end="00:36:26.740" style="s2">whatever I think my howcome is to where</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.730" end="00:36:28.810" style="s2">my outcome is actually being in a way</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.740" end="00:36:31.690" style="s2">that is an integrity with an honoring of</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.810" end="00:36:34.170" style="s2">all life now it&#39;s the virtue of it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.690" end="00:36:35.900" style="s2">I I was having this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.170" end="00:36:38.539" style="s2">recently</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.900" end="00:36:40.910" style="s2">about people who are obsessed with life</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.539" end="00:36:42.140" style="s2">hacking and optimizing everything and</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.910" end="00:36:44.270" style="s2">when they get into that mindset</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.140" end="00:36:46.579" style="s2">eventually they get to what what they</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.270" end="00:36:48.380" style="s2">call optimizing relationships and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.579" end="00:36:50.089" style="s2">they start putting people on a value</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.380" end="00:36:51.799" style="s2">hierarchy where they want to interact</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.089" end="00:36:53.510" style="s2">with high-value people and they want to</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.799" end="00:36:55.819" style="s2">get a high value woman and they&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.510" end="00:36:58.369" style="s2">these tactics to find and attract the</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.819" end="00:37:01.880" style="s2">most high-value woman and it&#39;s funny</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.369" end="00:37:03.980" style="s2">because those people in my experience</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.880" end="00:37:06.319" style="s2">are some of the most existentially</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.980" end="00:37:09.230" style="s2">unhappy people that I&#39;ve met and they</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.319" end="00:37:11.329" style="s2">will never demonstrate it outward in an</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.230" end="00:37:13.430" style="s2">outward way but that&#39;s what I&#39;ve noticed</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.329" end="00:37:15.440" style="s2">that you know people who try to optimize</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.430" end="00:37:17.710" style="s2">everything in this kind of utilitarian</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.440" end="00:37:20.650" style="s2">way end up really profoundly unhappy</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.710" end="00:37:23.720" style="s2">yeah what&#39;s the same thing as</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.650" end="00:37:25.460" style="s2">continuously pursuing a better hi it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.720" end="00:37:26.990" style="s2">I&#39;m getting a hit from winning at a</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.460" end="00:37:27.829" style="s2">particular thing so I got to try and win</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.990" end="00:37:30.710" style="s2">at it all the time</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.829" end="00:37:32.059" style="s2">but I need the hit because my baseline</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.710" end="00:37:33.410" style="s2">is the lay feels meaningless</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.059" end="00:37:35.059" style="s2">because I don&#39;t actually have any real</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.410" end="00:37:37.460" style="s2">relationships and there I don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.059" end="00:37:40.000" style="s2">know what meaning needs I don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.460" end="00:37:43.190" style="s2">know what intimacy means and so that</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.000" end="00:37:45.559" style="s2">hypo normal environment needs a hyper</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.190" end="00:37:47.119" style="s2">normal stimuli to feel anything and then</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.559" end="00:37:49.069" style="s2">the fact that I used people</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.119" end="00:37:50.990" style="s2">instrumentally has people end up not</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.069" end="00:37:52.539" style="s2">liking me which makes me hurt even more</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.990" end="00:37:56.150" style="s2">which makes me want another hit II</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.539" end="00:37:58.039" style="s2">people like you make it super DC you</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.150" end="00:37:59.450" style="s2">just come on and it&#39;s like we listen to</p>
