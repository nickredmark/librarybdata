<p begin="00:00:15.900" end="00:00:26.240" style="s2">get a worse storm I think than what</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.060" end="00:00:28.529" style="s2">Texas got and the positive side the</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.240" end="00:00:30.150" style="s2">human story of people coming together</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.529" end="00:00:32.520" style="s2">and rest meet each other I think they</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.150" end="00:00:33.750" style="s2">learned from Hurricane Katrina that you</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.520" end="00:00:36.630" style="s2">can&#39;t just leave things up to the</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.750" end="00:00:38.520" style="s2">government they are human and failed and</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.630" end="00:00:40.739" style="s2">don&#39;t necessarily have the resources to</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.520" end="00:00:42.870" style="s2">respond to a natural disaster like they</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.739" end="00:00:46.800" style="s2">probably would want to and that people</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.870" end="00:00:48.770" style="s2">need them too there&#39;s a prison I believe</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.800" end="00:00:51.870" style="s2">it was in Texas I was reading about that</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.770" end="00:00:54.090" style="s2">the prisoners there are just living in</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.870" end="00:00:56.670" style="s2">abhorrent conditions drinking toilet</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.090" end="00:00:58.140" style="s2">water because they haven&#39;t been allowed</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.670" end="00:01:00.000" style="s2">out of their cells their cells are</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.140" end="00:01:01.710" style="s2">flooded they&#39;ve been eating - sound</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.000" end="00:01:03.780" style="s2">which is a day they get no hot food they</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.710" end="00:01:06.930" style="s2">have a minute of their cells only know</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.780" end="00:01:08.850" style="s2">this from front of the wives and last</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.930" end="00:01:10.530" style="s2">feel good story but I feel like two</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.850" end="00:01:14.220" style="s2">things one of which is we need a way to</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.530" end="00:01:16.979" style="s2">keep tabs on prisoners and I don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.220" end="00:01:19.680" style="s2">tabs like the state does I mean tabs</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.979" end="00:01:22.080" style="s2">like to know that prisoners are okay</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.680" end="00:01:24.540" style="s2">watching the which I realize is fiction</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.080" end="00:01:28.290" style="s2">but based on some truth the orange is</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.540" end="00:01:31.710" style="s2">the new black latest season of them in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.290" end="00:01:33.479" style="s2">prison riot for the whole season and</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.710" end="00:01:34.890" style="s2">these things can go on in prison and we</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.479" end="00:01:38.340" style="s2">need to be able to have accountability</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.890" end="00:01:40.020" style="s2">to know how prisoners are being treated</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.340" end="00:01:42.479" style="s2">especially when they&#39;re being treated as</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.020" end="00:01:47.430" style="s2">a quantity the other thing that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.479" end="00:01:50.369" style="s2">feeling right now is that as tragic as</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.430" end="00:01:54.890" style="s2">these storms are they&#39;re just gonna keep</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.369" end="00:01:58.909" style="s2">happening until we do something about</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.890" end="00:02:01.920" style="s2">how we&#39;re causing it there&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.909" end="00:02:04.409" style="s2">more and more frequent more devastating</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.920" end="00:02:07.290" style="s2">and as much as we love to pull together</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.409" end="00:02:09.989" style="s2">for people that are here in the West</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.290" end="00:02:13.020" style="s2">with us and donate money that could only</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.989" end="00:02:14.850" style="s2">happen so often we can&#39;t not</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.020" end="00:02:17.610" style="s2">everyone can donate every forest fire</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.850" end="00:02:20.760" style="s2">and every flood and every hurricane and</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.610" end="00:02:23.670" style="s2">every tornado we just need to stop them</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.760" end="00:02:25.740" style="s2">from happening we need to stop it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.670" end="00:02:28.440" style="s2">insanity if not listening to scientists</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.740" end="00:02:30.150" style="s2">and we&#39;re clear they not gonna listen to</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.440" end="00:02:32.250" style="s2">the government nor should we because</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.150" end="00:02:33.600" style="s2">they aren&#39;t necessarily trustworthy the</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.250" end="00:02:36.900" style="s2">media is in it for profit</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.600" end="00:02:40.530" style="s2">so we need to do it we need to collect</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.900" end="00:02:41.910" style="s2">the data and figure out what needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.530" end="00:02:46.110" style="s2">done and how much carbon is being</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.910" end="00:02:48.510" style="s2">released by what it parts of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.110" end="00:02:50.370" style="s2">industry and how can we do better and</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.510" end="00:02:52.950" style="s2">that&#39;s a lot of what I want the global</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.370" end="00:02:55.770" style="s2">cooperative to do and it just I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.950" end="00:02:57.330" style="s2">know I don&#39;t find it realized he puts</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.770" end="00:03:00.480" style="s2">bloodying these hurricanes aren&#39;t about</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.330" end="00:03:02.880" style="s2">me I&#39;m here safe and Vancouver we have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.480" end="00:03:05.940" style="s2">hazy day and I&#39;m having difficulty</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.880" end="00:03:07.770" style="s2">breathing outside and just low energy</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.940" end="00:03:09.300" style="s2">because of forest fires that again are</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.770" end="00:03:11.670" style="s2">directly affecting me their secondary</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.300" end="00:03:15.900" style="s2">affecting me the smoke that drifts into</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.670" end="00:03:18.930" style="s2">my city is affecting me and I can only</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.900" end="00:03:22.920" style="s2">imagine losing my home worried about my</p>

<p begin="00:03:24.420" end="00:03:29.160" style="s2">do is still having to pay rent when you</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.740" end="00:03:31.740" style="s2">don&#39;t have somewhere to live and knowing</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.160" end="00:03:35.670" style="s2">that this idea I have for a global</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.740" end="00:03:39.240" style="s2">cooperative if I had started it five</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.670" end="00:03:43.020" style="s2">years ago maybe I mean it would&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.240" end="00:03:46.110" style="s2">helped the actual flooding ends but we</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.020" end="00:03:48.450" style="s2">would have had systems in place to help</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.110" end="00:03:50.459" style="s2">a readily and to know that in the future</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.450" end="00:03:54.600" style="s2">there&#39;s gonna be less and less storms</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.459" end="00:03:57.209" style="s2">instead of more and more and better ways</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.600" end="00:04:01.020" style="s2">of helping knowing where the nonprofit</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.209" end="00:04:02.400" style="s2">money is going and how much is being</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.020" end="00:04:03.990" style="s2">donated and where it&#39;s actually going</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.400" end="00:04:05.670" style="s2">and what&#39;s the best use right if you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:04:38.639" end="00:04:43.980" style="s2">knowledge and make up for the ways that</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.610" end="00:04:46.620" style="s2">we ourselves lack knowledge so if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.980" end="00:04:47.930" style="s2">not a great interpersonal person if you</p>

<p begin="00:04:59.340" end="00:05:02.910" style="s2">those people who are definitely lonely</p>
