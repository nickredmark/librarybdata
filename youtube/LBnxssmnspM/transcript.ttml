<p begin="00:00:18.510" end="00:00:25.330" style="s2">so this is what I wrote on Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.710" end="00:00:27.760" style="s2">which got me more attention and comments</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.330" end="00:00:30.400" style="s2">and discussion than anything I&#39;ve ever</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.760" end="00:00:34.330" style="s2">practically written before this is what</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.400" end="00:00:37.720" style="s2">I wrote if your only image of a man is a</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.330" end="00:00:38.640" style="s2">domineering male oppressor and this is</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.720" end="00:00:41.500" style="s2">what you get</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.640" end="00:00:44.830" style="s2">monster demigods like Harvey Weinstein</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.500" end="00:00:46.870" style="s2">and Donald Trump I suggest that we at</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.830" end="00:00:50.440" style="s2">the very least need to cultivate a more</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.870" end="00:00:55.750" style="s2">positive view of men and perhaps more</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.440" end="00:00:58.300" style="s2">noble gentle men will arise we need to</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.750" end="00:01:02.310" style="s2">remember that despite the glass ceiling</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.300" end="00:01:07.119" style="s2">for women men have been traditionally</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.310" end="00:01:11.110" style="s2">disposable and more time they die about</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.119" end="00:01:16.960" style="s2">six years younger on average they do</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.110" end="00:01:21.360" style="s2">most of the dangerous jobs they keep the</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.960" end="00:01:24.370" style="s2">infrastructure running they&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.360" end="00:01:29.530" style="s2">susceptible to drugs and alcohol and</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.370" end="00:01:36.430" style="s2">violent crime and suicide suicide among</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.530" end="00:01:38.770" style="s2">young men is astronomical and of course</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.430" end="00:01:42.570" style="s2">it&#39;s mostly men who are filling up our</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.770" end="00:01:42.570" style="s2">prisons and learn thick asylums</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.540" end="00:01:49.370" style="s2">so even though a man have a lot of power</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.490" end="00:01:56.470" style="s2">and often use their power and negative</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.370" end="00:01:56.470" style="s2">ways towards women at the same time men</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.390" end="00:02:07.450" style="s2">kind of suffer in in ways that is not</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.620" end="00:02:09.680" style="s2">always acknowledged I feel and and</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.450" end="00:02:12.380" style="s2">because often men don&#39;t have the courage</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.680" end="00:02:16.270" style="s2">to talk about it or else they talk about</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.380" end="00:02:16.270" style="s2">it in this cheesy kind of aggressive way</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.960" end="00:02:21.140" style="s2">so anyway is there anything to love</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.100" end="00:02:29.020" style="s2">about men since men do all the bad</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.140" end="00:02:31.730" style="s2">things in the world apparently surely</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.020" end="00:02:36.580" style="s2">there is a place for men you know and</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.730" end="00:02:36.580" style="s2">for men&#39;s vitality and even virility</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.910" end="00:02:47.230" style="s2">ensure that our job is not merely to</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.180" end="00:02:51.020" style="s2">tame and chastise and socialize and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.230" end="00:02:56.630" style="s2">would say all that means castrate men</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.020" end="00:02:59.180" style="s2">mmm I think the first couple ways of</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.630" end="00:03:03.110" style="s2">feminism and I&#39;ve been very good for men</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.180" end="00:03:05.390" style="s2">and women generally and helped us to</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.110" end="00:03:10.120" style="s2">understand as I said before that men are</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.390" end="00:03:10.120" style="s2">the same and that men are different</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.620" end="00:03:21.370" style="s2">maybe the third and fourth wave of</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.239" end="00:03:27.760" style="s2">feminism has been problematic in some</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.370" end="00:03:31.360" style="s2">ways so maybe we need a fifth wave of</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.760" end="00:03:34.060" style="s2">feminism so I&#39;d say there&#39;s a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.360" end="00:03:38.130" style="s2">negative view of men these days and in</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.060" end="00:03:38.130" style="s2">the media and for probably good reason</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.190" end="00:03:48.430" style="s2">at the same time I think gender bashing</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.420" end="00:03:51.030" style="s2">is unappropriate and has to go you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.430" end="00:03:51.030" style="s2">on all fronts</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.360" end="00:03:58.299" style="s2">our image of men&#39;s to be balanced and</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.290" end="00:04:03.280" style="s2">I&#39;m not talking about some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.299" end="00:04:07.330" style="s2">cheesy conservative men&#39;s movement or</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.280" end="00:04:15.459" style="s2">for their polarization but I am talking</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.330" end="00:04:17.709" style="s2">about cherishing loving men more and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.459" end="00:04:19.269" style="s2">would like to suggest that real men are</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.709" end="00:04:27.150" style="s2">not interested in mere powered</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.269" end="00:04:30.070" style="s2">domination mere fucking I&#39;d say real men</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.150" end="00:04:35.620" style="s2">don&#39;t give a shit about power unless</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.070" end="00:04:38.110" style="s2">it&#39;s when I say real men I mean a real</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.620" end="00:04:43.720" style="s2">manliness is about not giving a shit</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.110" end="00:04:47.500" style="s2">about of power actually it&#39;s about being</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.720" end="00:04:49.539" style="s2">noble self-sacrificing and it&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.500" end="00:04:51.600" style="s2">about power in the senses about the</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.539" end="00:04:57.370" style="s2">power of maybe creativity and</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.600" end="00:04:58.840" style="s2">transformation intelligence of course</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.370" end="00:05:01.320" style="s2">what that the same thing goes for women</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.840" end="00:05:01.320" style="s2">as well</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.990" end="00:05:08.640" style="s2">but nobody&#39;s saying that when it comes</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.190" end="00:05:08.640" style="s2">to men</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.160" end="00:05:18.310" style="s2">so all these men who get caught with</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.960" end="00:05:22.860" style="s2">their dick in their hand engaged in</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.310" end="00:05:27.880" style="s2">disgusting acts why are they so</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.860" end="00:05:31.690" style="s2">powerless surely they need to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.880" end="00:05:34.900" style="s2">empowered when it comes to their</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.690" end="00:05:40.960" style="s2">relationship to nubile young women for</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.900" end="00:05:48.610" style="s2">instance and why are women so powerless</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.960" end="00:05:50.440" style="s2">in front of real or imagined power it</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.610" end="00:05:54.460" style="s2">seems like so many men seem to be at</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.440" end="00:05:56.920" style="s2">this level of arrested emotional sexual</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.460" end="00:05:59.590" style="s2">development and apparently they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.920" end="00:06:01.330" style="s2">incapable of saying yes or no and these</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.590" end="00:06:03.430" style="s2">are the same people with immense worldly</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.330" end="00:06:07.570" style="s2">power so with the Nick Euler codes and</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.430" end="00:06:10.480" style="s2">and whatnot which is rather scary and it</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.570" end="00:06:13.090" style="s2">seems to me that there are many people</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.480" end="00:06:15.700" style="s2">in high places that are not really men</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.090" end="00:06:22.750" style="s2">or not really women they&#39;re more like</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.700" end="00:06:24.610" style="s2">girls and boys and that&#39;s also scary so</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.750" end="00:06:26.860" style="s2">what should we do about all this I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.610" end="00:06:29.170" style="s2">the remedy is to become a complete</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.860" end="00:06:34.330" style="s2">person and what does that mean that</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.170" end="00:06:36.790" style="s2">means meeting the other could be the</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.330" end="00:06:40.300" style="s2">other sex or the other just the other</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.790" end="00:06:44.370" style="s2">person and as deep away as possible</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.300" end="00:06:44.370" style="s2">I&#39;m not isolating oneself</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.450" end="00:06:55.890" style="s2">we should meet the other in all her his</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.090" end="00:06:55.890" style="s2">glorious other nests that&#39;s how we</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.430" end="00:07:08.610" style="s2">destroy the immature person note I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.840" end="00:07:16.050" style="s2">exclude any other kind of relationship</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.610" end="00:07:20.080" style="s2">here relationship is always about</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.050" end="00:07:26.140" style="s2">polarity no matter what kind of bodies</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.080" end="00:07:28.690" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about there&#39;s what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.140" end="00:07:33.550" style="s2">Taoists call a flowery war I really like</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.690" end="00:07:39.130" style="s2">that expression between men and women</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.550" end="00:07:44.020" style="s2">between the two polarities well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.130" end="00:07:51.450" style="s2">pretty obvious these days but such a war</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.020" end="00:07:56.980" style="s2">should be not nasty and underhanded but</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.450" end="00:08:01.900" style="s2">more like a dance not something</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.980" end="00:08:08.110" style="s2">beautiful which requires humility rather</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.900" end="00:08:12.040" style="s2">than gender bashing so I hear a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.110" end="00:08:14.620" style="s2">people talk about how we&#39;re moving from</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.040" end="00:08:21.820" style="s2">this patriarchal age into a matriarchal</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.620" end="00:08:26.250" style="s2">age that gets people pretty excited but</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.820" end="00:08:30.100" style="s2">that&#39;s still polarity that&#39;s still about</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.250" end="00:08:32.320" style="s2">dominating others so men have dominated</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.100" end="00:08:34.330" style="s2">others for thousands of years apparently</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.320" end="00:08:40.420" style="s2">you know women would like to dominate</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.330" end="00:08:42.290" style="s2">men or would they if you&#39;re only talking</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.420" end="00:08:47.500" style="s2">about power</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.290" end="00:08:52.540" style="s2">and if women suddenly ruled the world</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.500" end="00:08:52.540" style="s2">then we would still be in a dynamic of</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.630" end="00:09:05.000" style="s2">domination it would be the same game</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.840" end="00:09:08.420" style="s2">just upside down so I&#39;d like to suggest</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.000" end="00:09:12.250" style="s2">that ruling is not about power but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.420" end="00:09:12.250" style="s2">about complementarity and</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.470" end="00:09:24.110" style="s2">complementarity as is that the root of</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.550" end="00:09:26.720" style="s2">all positive transformation it exists</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.110" end="00:09:33.920" style="s2">when we consider the other bow rather</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.720" end="00:09:38.000" style="s2">than it to refer to Martin Buber the it</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.920" end="00:09:46.340" style="s2">is the object okay we are not objects we</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.000" end="00:09:48.230" style="s2">are sacred to each other so I would say</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.340" end="00:09:49.040" style="s2">that we need to actually worship each</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.230" end="00:09:52.310" style="s2">other again</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.040" end="00:09:55.730" style="s2">to restore the positive archetype of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.310" end="00:10:01.160" style="s2">noble heroic man along with the noble</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.730" end="00:10:06.800" style="s2">and heroic woman so that we can both</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.160" end="00:10:11.980" style="s2">rule and this is the I would say that</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.800" end="00:10:11.980" style="s2">primarily religious impulse it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.430" end="00:10:15.790" style="s2">symbol behind</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.840" end="00:10:22.400" style="s2">spiritual truth it&#39;s the union of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.270" end="00:10:29.660" style="s2">the male and the and the female the</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.400" end="00:10:33.400" style="s2">masculine and the feminine we tend to</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.660" end="00:10:33.400" style="s2">think that evolution is about progress</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.490" end="00:10:42.410" style="s2">our Ahmet emancipation from these</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.920" end="00:10:44.060" style="s2">tyrannical demigods or men of power but</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.410" end="00:10:46.010" style="s2">the next question is you know what will</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.060" end="00:10:48.740" style="s2">we do when we&#39;re free of all these</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.010" end="00:10:53.150" style="s2">tyrannical men when we&#39;ve rid the world</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.740" end="00:10:55.510" style="s2">of psychopathic men of power what comes</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.150" end="00:10:55.510" style="s2">next</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.400" end="00:11:04.610" style="s2">we love stories of emancipation and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.810" end="00:11:06.380" style="s2">downfall of the tyrant but we&#39;re much</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.610" end="00:11:08.840" style="s2">less attracted to stories about the</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.380" end="00:11:12.290" style="s2">morning after but that&#39;s when the real</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.840" end="00:11:15.200" style="s2">work begins the problem is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.290" end="00:11:20.120" style="s2">emancipation is only half the story the</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.200" end="00:11:22.270" style="s2">second half is less dramatic the second</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.120" end="00:11:25.970" style="s2">half is about responsibility and</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.270" end="00:11:28.390" style="s2">complementarity I would argue not just</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.970" end="00:11:28.390" style="s2">rights</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.510" end="00:11:36.750" style="s2">Nietzsche may have been wrong when he</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.529" end="00:11:38.160" style="s2">said we&#39;ve killed God maybe we&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.750" end="00:11:44.250" style="s2">anesthetized him</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.160" end="00:11:47.399" style="s2">maybe the patriarch Jehovah doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.250" end="00:11:51.510" style="s2">really die he just goes underground if</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.399" end="00:11:54.570" style="s2">he is repressed that is it&#39;s not a good</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.510" end="00:11:58.260" style="s2">thing to repress the patriarch or the</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.570" end="00:12:00.180" style="s2">matriarch if you repress the patriarch</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.260" end="00:12:03.450" style="s2">you get a lot of powerless and</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.180" end="00:12:06.690" style="s2">unconscious men in power that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.450" end="00:12:10.649" style="s2">happening the tyrannical unconscious men</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.690" end="00:12:13.950" style="s2">of power have whole armies at their</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.649" end="00:12:16.380" style="s2">beckoning and yet they appear to be so</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.950" end="00:12:18.300" style="s2">out of touch with their bodies and minds</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.380" end="00:12:24.870" style="s2">to put it mildly and that is not a good</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.300" end="00:12:26.490" style="s2">thing to understate the case again so</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.870" end="00:12:29.250" style="s2">it&#39;s not really my place to make this</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.490" end="00:12:35.010" style="s2">kind of declaration but I hope somebody</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.250" end="00:12:37.650" style="s2">will soon I propose that fist the fifth</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.010" end="00:12:43.470" style="s2">wave of feminism should be characterized</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.650" end="00:12:47.670" style="s2">by women adoring men again and also men</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.470" end="00:12:50.310" style="s2">adoring women of course other forms of</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.670" end="00:12:55.130" style="s2">adoration should be welcomed as well</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.310" end="00:12:55.130" style="s2">that goes without saying in my book</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.120" end="00:13:03.170" style="s2">the fact is that most men benefit most</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.300" end="00:13:07.249" style="s2">from adoring women and women benefit by</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.170" end="00:13:09.410" style="s2">adoring men that&#39;s how the polarities of</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.249" end="00:13:13.129" style="s2">the universe are dying to to meet and</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.410" end="00:13:18.559" style="s2">come together in and clash and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.129" end="00:13:21.399" style="s2">how the child of creativity is born if</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.559" end="00:13:28.459" style="s2">there is no adoration then people remain</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.399" end="00:13:32.319" style="s2">angry and bitter and polarized they</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.459" end="00:13:36.139" style="s2">remain impotent half people</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.319" end="00:13:38.059" style="s2">revolutionaries or bloodthirsty I would</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.139" end="00:13:41.629" style="s2">just like to smash the the system but</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.059" end="00:13:43.339" style="s2">don&#39;t really have anything to to offer</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.629" end="00:13:46.240" style="s2">after they&#39;ve destroyed the the</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.339" end="00:13:46.240" style="s2">patriarchy</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.740" end="00:14:03.900" style="s2">so when the tyrant is finally overthrown</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.320" end="00:14:05.970" style="s2">who and and what and how will we put the</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.900" end="00:14:11.030" style="s2">highest in that place whatever that</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.970" end="00:14:15.150" style="s2">happens to be what just probably beyond</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.030" end="00:14:20.820" style="s2">male and female in some sense it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.150" end="00:14:22.920" style="s2">the principle of the highest and that</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.820" end="00:14:25.500" style="s2">needs to be reinstated otherwise you</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.920" end="00:14:31.830" style="s2">have a flat world where everybody is</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.500" end="00:14:37.470" style="s2">just one gender and that&#39;s a natural and</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.830" end="00:14:43.040" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t work at least that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.470" end="00:14:43.040" style="s2">think anyway so thank you for listening</p>
