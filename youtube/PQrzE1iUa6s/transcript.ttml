<p begin="00:04:06.799" end="00:04:13.549" style="s2">Big Ten big time wrestling program in</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.560" end="00:04:16.459" style="s2">the Midwest men like big old farm boys</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.549" end="00:04:18.739" style="s2">corn-fed the whole thing but you</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.459" end="00:04:20.479" style="s2">literally just showed up one day like</p>

<p begin="00:04:20.479" end="00:04:23.870" style="s2">well one program well that&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.580" end="00:04:27.139" style="s2">is there&#39;s not really money</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.870" end="00:04:30.260" style="s2">and wrestling most guys are walk-ons</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.139" end="00:04:32.570" style="s2">joining as a walk-on so we had like 17</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.260" end="00:04:34.280" style="s2">guys that came out with the freshmen</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.570" end="00:04:36.520" style="s2">team that year we had like two guys on</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.280" end="00:04:38.540" style="s2">scholarship three guys on scholarship</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.520" end="00:04:43.310" style="s2">because it&#39;s not morning you can</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.540" end="00:04:45.080" style="s2">rustling so you know but after the first</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.310" end="00:04:48.979" style="s2">two weeks like more than 50% of those</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.080" end="00:04:50.360" style="s2">guys quit right no so nobody&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.979" end="00:04:54.050" style="s2">wrestling that&#39;s sort of like the story</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.360" end="00:04:55.669" style="s2">of the UFC fight or two is now kind of I</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.050" end="00:04:58.250" style="s2">think it&#39;s a little different things are</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.669" end="00:05:00.500" style="s2">changing now with the internet I believe</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.250" end="00:05:02.539" style="s2">in social media because people people</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.500" end="00:05:04.460" style="s2">are following along with wrestling more</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.539" end="00:05:07.039" style="s2">now it&#39;s easier to know who people are</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.460" end="00:05:08.539" style="s2">and see matches across the world so I</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.039" end="00:05:10.460" style="s2">think I think there&#39;s slowly money</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.539" end="00:05:13.070" style="s2">coming into wrestling right because I</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.460" end="00:05:14.660" style="s2">remember in the early days like half the</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.070" end="00:05:15.979" style="s2">guys who ended up in the UFC really yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.660" end="00:05:17.870" style="s2">I wrestled and then there was no money</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.979" end="00:05:20.000" style="s2">in that so what was I gonna do next</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.870" end="00:05:21.560" style="s2">gonna start fighting people yep kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.000" end="00:05:24.289" style="s2">what kind of what I did yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.560" end="00:05:29.150" style="s2">so I saw after that after that bad</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.289" end="00:05:31.310" style="s2">season I got a our coach came out with a</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.150" end="00:05:32.810" style="s2">workout journals so we keep ourselves</p>

<p begin="00:22:16.070" end="00:22:19.130" style="s2">of the things I really like about the</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.850" end="00:22:24.350" style="s2">book it&#39;s a time capsule of like us</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.130" end="00:22:26.210" style="s2">building the methods of how people train</p>

<p begin="00:22:28.070" end="00:22:31.910" style="s2">just sergeant but there&#39;s a lot of gyms</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.270" end="00:22:34.550" style="s2">that for big gyms that created things</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.910" end="00:22:36.170" style="s2">that other people bit off of no because</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.550" end="00:22:38.540" style="s2">they worked so right you know the</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.170" end="00:22:39.830" style="s2">training strategies the styles you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.540" end="00:22:41.540" style="s2">not just the techniques but the way of</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.830" end="00:22:44.000" style="s2">training and conditioning and getting</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.540" end="00:22:45.800" style="s2">ready for fights at all that all was</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.000" end="00:22:48.740" style="s2">being developed in those early 2000</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.800" end="00:22:50.090" style="s2">years and he was a little bit about that</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.740" end="00:22:51.200" style="s2">like what</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.090" end="00:22:53.000" style="s2">what would you how would you</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.200" end="00:22:55.100" style="s2">characterize like the training meso or</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.000" end="00:22:57.320" style="s2">they counted one of the things that is</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.100" end="00:22:59.630" style="s2">in the book is you know I I&#39;m a big</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.320" end="00:23:02.570" style="s2">advocate of lifting weights it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.630" end="00:23:05.110" style="s2">important you know but lifting weights</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.570" end="00:23:09.590" style="s2">the way I did in high school and college</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.110" end="00:23:12.680" style="s2">was kind of geared for bodybuilding and</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.590" end="00:23:14.600" style="s2">football okay right so short term</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.680" end="00:23:19.460" style="s2">explosive it wasn&#39;t built for you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.600" end="00:23:21.770" style="s2">endurance type stuff so there&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.460" end="00:23:23.930" style="s2">more recovery needed for those types of</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.770" end="00:23:25.910" style="s2">lifts so when I went out to California</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.930" end="00:23:27.650" style="s2">I&#39;m doing those types of lifts in trying</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.910" end="00:23:29.660" style="s2">to do jujitsu than I have am a trained</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.650" end="00:23:31.220" style="s2">in jiu-jitsu again and then some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.660" end="00:23:33.260" style="s2">mid trainers like three or four workouts</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.220" end="00:23:35.420" style="s2">in that day plus them weight training</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.260" end="00:23:36.830" style="s2">like I couldn&#39;t do it body couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.420" end="00:23:39.740" style="s2">handle it your body doesn&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.830" end="00:23:42.230" style="s2">time to recover so I stopped lifting and</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.740" end="00:23:44.720" style="s2">then that transferred into we started</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.230" end="00:23:46.280" style="s2">doing Crossfit just like 2003 it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.720" end="00:23:47.990" style="s2">there&#39;s only a few CrossFit&#39;s around we</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.280" end="00:23:49.000" style="s2">had to drive to Santa Cruz to go do it</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.990" end="00:23:51.960" style="s2">and drive half hour</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.000" end="00:23:54.220" style="s2">do it so we really like some of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.960" end="00:23:56.679" style="s2">training stuff that was done in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.220" end="00:23:58.960" style="s2">CrossFit but the cost fits like its own</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.679" end="00:24:01.960" style="s2">sport you do that and you wiped out the</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.960" end="00:24:03.820" style="s2">rest of the day right so we had to stop</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.960" end="00:24:05.500" style="s2">doing that I&#39;ve done CrossFit a long</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.820" end="00:24:07.270" style="s2">time I would do the twelve o&#39;clock and I</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.500" end="00:24:09.280" style="s2">come back at 1:30 I&#39;d be like no I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.270" end="00:24:11.320" style="s2">done I just want to get yeah so I you</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.280" end="00:24:13.330" style="s2">know we would do that and then jiu-jitsu</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.320" end="00:24:15.789" style="s2">and then training it&#39;s fine it&#39;s just we</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.330" end="00:24:18.100" style="s2">were done there&#39;s nothing so that we</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.789" end="00:24:20.260" style="s2">stop that but we started taking things</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.100" end="00:24:22.510" style="s2">from those workouts and putting them</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.260" end="00:24:25.120" style="s2">together and like I didn&#39;t get back to</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.510" end="00:24:27.429" style="s2">lifting weights again and finding a good</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.120" end="00:24:30.039" style="s2">way to do it into like 2013 I think is</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.429" end="00:24:33.120" style="s2">why I finally I finally figured out the</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.039" end="00:24:35.289" style="s2">way to do it right for MMA in my opinion</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.120" end="00:24:37.630" style="s2">but yeah so like there&#39;s things like</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.289" end="00:24:39.490" style="s2">that that were developed our cardio we</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.630" end="00:24:41.230" style="s2">had this bike workout that were there</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.490" end="00:24:43.510" style="s2">were that I think everybody does now</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.230" end="00:24:45.940" style="s2">it&#39;s a circuit training bike workout and</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.510" end="00:24:48.070" style="s2">that kind of came stemming from a K and</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.940" end="00:24:51.220" style="s2">it&#39;s taking some stuff from CrossFit and</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.070" end="00:24:54.760" style="s2">putting it together so you guys do spin</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.220" end="00:24:56.289" style="s2">classes oh I&#39;m hearing no there&#39;s I have</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.760" end="00:24:59.830" style="s2">a video on my youtube official John</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.289" end="00:25:02.710" style="s2">Fitch YouTube page and uh it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.830" end="00:25:05.559" style="s2">it&#39;s a sample of a bike workout and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.710" end="00:25:07.330" style="s2">only 15 minutes but it&#39;s one-minute</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.559" end="00:25:09.610" style="s2">sprint on the bike one minute like box</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.330" end="00:25:12.220" style="s2">jumps limited of some other thing and</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.610" end="00:25:14.590" style="s2">then go back to the bike and do that and</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.220" end="00:25:16.450" style="s2">it&#39;ll it&#39;ll it&#39;ll kill you it&#39;ll kill</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.590" end="00:25:17.500" style="s2">you and it&#39;ll lead to more and better</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.450" end="00:25:19.330" style="s2">body composition</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.500" end="00:25:22.120" style="s2">they&#39;re not just thing that grow in a</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.330" end="00:25:24.789" style="s2">mile right yeah well the Sprint finisher</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.120" end="00:25:26.530" style="s2">so MMA is interesting because you also</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.789" end="00:25:28.570" style="s2">you have to have that explosive power</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.530" end="00:25:30.100" style="s2">but you&#39;ll need that grinding endurance</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.570" end="00:25:32.350" style="s2">too so it must be hard to really balance</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.100" end="00:25:35.080" style="s2">that out yes and a lot of guys are just</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.350" end="00:25:36.820" style="s2">way too lazy to condition themselves to</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.080" end="00:25:40.659" style="s2">handle it and that&#39;s why I like to fight</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.820" end="00:25:43.690" style="s2">inside yeah 99.9% of the guys out there</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.659" end="00:25:46.600" style="s2">will get exhausted in a thirty second</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.690" end="00:25:48.970" style="s2">arm hand fight with me right I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.600" end="00:25:50.679" style="s2">they&#39;re just not used to it right much</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.970" end="00:25:52.419" style="s2">less you on top of them on the ground</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.679" end="00:25:54.039" style="s2">pounding them in the face oh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.419" end="00:25:57.950" style="s2">that&#39;s when they start getting really</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.039" end="00:26:00.050" style="s2">tired then I start taking them down and</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.950" end="00:26:02.120" style="s2">when when you get a guy down on the</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.050" end="00:26:05.840" style="s2">ground can you tell can you tell when</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.120" end="00:26:07.730" style="s2">they like they give up um I mean yes</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.840" end="00:26:09.740" style="s2">yeah you can tell them the guys kind</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.730" end="00:26:13.340" style="s2">given up but things have changed like</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.740" end="00:26:16.550" style="s2">sometime around 2008 the UFC started</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.340" end="00:26:19.190" style="s2">pushing commissions and referees to</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.550" end="00:26:20.750" style="s2">start standing fights up faster right it</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.190" end="00:26:22.490" style="s2">used to be if you got taken down the</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.750" end="00:26:24.320" style="s2">only way to get up was if you submitted</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.490" end="00:26:27.050" style="s2">the guy you swept the guy or you fought</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.320" end="00:26:30.950" style="s2">up and got to your feet right now they</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.050" end="00:26:32.660" style="s2">started changing things so that if you</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.950" end="00:26:34.100" style="s2">can hold on to the guys you keep your</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.660" end="00:26:37.310" style="s2">guard closed and you can hold on to his</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.100" end="00:26:39.380" style="s2">arms long enough and stop all action the</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.310" end="00:26:42.530" style="s2">ref will stop you up and reward you all</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.380" end="00:26:45.110" style="s2">right so it used to be guys time would</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.530" end="00:26:46.460" style="s2">give up a submission to give to get out</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.110" end="00:26:48.980" style="s2">of the fight because they couldn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.460" end="00:26:50.600" style="s2">away all right then stick an arm up in</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.980" end="00:26:52.820" style="s2">the air they stick their neck out stick</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.600" end="00:26:54.200" style="s2">an arm out yeah basically that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.820" end="00:26:56.780" style="s2">easy you want to just make put your head</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.200" end="00:26:58.520" style="s2">out in a bad position right you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.780" end="00:27:00.200" style="s2">getting punched anymore but that</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.520" end="00:27:01.640" style="s2">outsider&#39;s perspective that looks like</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.200" end="00:27:03.950" style="s2">the most terrifying position in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.640" end="00:27:05.930" style="s2">whole world to billon but when you get</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.950" end="00:27:08.060" style="s2">guys who get rewarded for not fighting</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.930" end="00:27:09.770" style="s2">for stopping the fight and it slows</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.060" end="00:27:12.020" style="s2">things down so now I can feel when I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.770" end="00:27:13.430" style="s2">broken the guy but he&#39;s not giving me</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.020" end="00:27:15.140" style="s2">the submissions that&#39;s to get his neck</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.430" end="00:27:17.420" style="s2">out he&#39;s holding on and he&#39;s just trying</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.140" end="00:27:20.300" style="s2">to shut me down until the ref stands me</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.420" end="00:27:21.800" style="s2">up got it that must be frustrating for</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.300" end="00:27:24.050" style="s2">it&#39;s very frustrating because I&#39;m the</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.800" end="00:27:26.060" style="s2">one he gets blamed for it right right</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.050" end="00:27:29.150" style="s2">you you look like you&#39;re slowing down</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.060" end="00:27:31.460" style="s2">the action but I saw I get criticized</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.150" end="00:27:33.620" style="s2">for being a boring fighter but I am</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.460" end="00:27:36.010" style="s2">still currently number two all-time</p>

<p begin="00:32:36.880" end="00:32:41.289" style="s2">way my strategy is generalized so like</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.740" end="00:32:44.289" style="s2">one thing I can focus on is don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.289" end="00:32:46.240" style="s2">hit right hands up yeah hand illegal</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.289" end="00:32:47.919" style="s2">don&#39;t get it so that&#39;s you move it</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.240" end="00:32:49.240" style="s2">that&#39;s a conscious thing goes right</p>

<p begin="00:33:16.840" end="00:33:21.970" style="s2">that but I don&#39;t I don&#39;t really need to</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.909" end="00:33:23.950" style="s2">be overwhelming myself with a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.970" end="00:33:26.380" style="s2">things I could be doing okay maybe that</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.950" end="00:33:27.100" style="s2">parry the jab moved left until this like</p>

<p begin="00:38:47.140" end="00:38:51.790" style="s2">oftentimes it seems sort of hocus-pocus</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.000" end="00:38:54.460" style="s2">or whatever but there really is</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.790" end="00:38:56.650" style="s2">something to be said for for really</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.460" end="00:38:58.540" style="s2">trying hard to imagine what it&#39;s like to</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.650" end="00:39:00.460" style="s2">be in those situations and to really</p>

<p begin="00:39:20.350" end="00:39:24.460" style="s2">and think about throwing strikes man I</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.700" end="00:39:27.850" style="s2">mean I think there&#39;s been research that</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.460" end="00:39:30.280" style="s2">showed it something like mirror mirror</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.850" end="00:39:33.100" style="s2">neurons but there&#39;s neurons that will</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.280" end="00:39:36.250" style="s2">fire the same way if you&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.100" end="00:39:37.720" style="s2">about doing something what even if</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.250" end="00:39:39.970" style="s2">you&#39;re not physically doing it so you</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.720" end="00:39:42.580" style="s2">can it&#39;s like you can train your motor</p>

<p begin="00:48:36.010" end="00:48:42.940" style="s2">differential between the champion - yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.370" end="00:48:44.860" style="s2">pay-per-view points yeah right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.940" end="00:48:51.130" style="s2">like almost having equity and the thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.860" end="00:48:53.800" style="s2">and some delays and its really what</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.130" end="00:48:57.370" style="s2">fighter purses are they even the most</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.800" end="00:48:58.090" style="s2">well paid guys are being robbed lately</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.370" end="00:49:00.580" style="s2">robbed</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.090" end="00:49:03.010" style="s2">yes let&#39;s talk about that a little bit I</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.580" end="00:49:06.460" style="s2">mean later later on an ear in your UFC</p>

<p begin="00:49:06.460" end="00:49:09.730" style="s2">your mind right but then you started</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.900" end="00:49:11.650" style="s2">thinking about the sport in general</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.730" end="00:49:15.010" style="s2">right and you&#39;ve gotten involved now in</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.650" end="00:49:17.230" style="s2">lawsuits I believe and sort of general</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.010" end="00:49:19.060" style="s2">advocacy for for fighters and fighters</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.230" end="00:49:20.260" style="s2">benefits and rights and stuff so why</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.060" end="00:49:25.210" style="s2">don&#39;t you tell us a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.260" end="00:49:26.710" style="s2">that yeah man so right from the</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.210" end="00:49:29.440" style="s2">beginning I can tell there was something</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.710" end="00:49:32.830" style="s2">off with you know seeing how they did</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.440" end="00:49:35.110" style="s2">business didn&#39;t make any sense why this</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.830" end="00:49:37.300" style="s2">sporting organization treated its</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.110" end="00:49:41.170" style="s2">athletes this way and no one else did</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.300" end="00:49:44.500" style="s2">and it wasn&#39;t until you know Carlos</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.170" end="00:49:46.330" style="s2">Newton former UFC champ started doing</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.500" end="00:49:48.670" style="s2">the groundwork to get some lawyers and</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.330" end="00:49:51.400" style="s2">people involved he found this guy Rob</p>

<p begin="00:49:52.780" end="00:50:02.260" style="s2">around over a decade a member of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.160" end="00:50:03.760" style="s2">board but we can tell if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.260" end="00:50:05.200" style="s2">something wrong carlos started he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.760" end="00:50:07.150" style="s2">smart guy I started studying so to</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.200" end="00:50:08.490" style="s2">figure it out and you know price</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.150" end="00:50:10.830" style="s2">fighting has been around you</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.490" end="00:50:13.230" style="s2">for over 100 years and there&#39;s laws</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.830" end="00:50:18.510" style="s2">about promised price fighting but</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.230" end="00:50:20.040" style="s2">they&#39;re not enforced in MMA there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.510" end="00:50:21.570" style="s2">reason but a clear distinction made</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.040" end="00:50:23.369" style="s2">between boxing and MMA even though</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.570" end="00:50:25.350" style="s2">they&#39;re both combat sports they try to</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.369" end="00:50:26.520" style="s2">say that the same sport but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.350" end="00:50:28.230" style="s2">interesting because they&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.520" end="00:50:34.410" style="s2">generally regulated and sanctioned by</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.230" end="00:50:36.990" style="s2">the same bodies - right</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.410" end="00:50:41.490" style="s2">and so like the disparity what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.990" end="00:50:45.200" style="s2">talking about here is that like this no</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.490" end="00:50:48.290" style="s2">sport no sport worldwide has this</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.200" end="00:50:53.340" style="s2">because it&#39;s illegal because it prevents</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.290" end="00:50:56.010" style="s2">competition right and that is the event</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.340" end="00:50:59.220" style="s2">organiser or promoter is not allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.010" end="00:51:03.330" style="s2">own exclusive contracts and control the</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.220" end="00:51:05.010" style="s2">title right job because they have too</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.330" end="00:51:06.540" style="s2">much leverage they have all the leverage</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.010" end="00:51:07.680" style="s2">they get to decide who fights for the</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.540" end="00:51:10.500" style="s2">championships they get to decide</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.680" end="00:51:12.000" style="s2">rankings it doesn&#39;t have to do anything</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.500" end="00:51:14.130" style="s2">to do with the skill has to do with how</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.000" end="00:51:15.990" style="s2">much money that promoter or event person</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.130" end="00:51:20.970" style="s2">is making if you look at every sport</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.990" end="00:51:23.910" style="s2">they all have you know the NFL NHL those</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.970" end="00:51:25.410" style="s2">are all NBA those distinction bodies the</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.910" end="00:51:28.380" style="s2">sanctioning body controls the title the</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.410" end="00:51:30.030" style="s2">team owner is the promoter he doesn&#39;t so</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.380" end="00:51:33.150" style="s2">you have each team is a promotion and</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.030" end="00:51:34.530" style="s2">you have a saint-jean body this is</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.150" end="00:51:35.910" style="s2">different because it&#39;s not common sports</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.530" end="00:51:38.760" style="s2">so the sanctioning body is also the</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.910" end="00:51:42.240" style="s2">regulator they regulate the sport we</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.760" end="00:51:45.119" style="s2">have a Athletic Commission which</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.240" end="00:51:48.000" style="s2">regulates a sport and it&#39;s a conflict of</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.119" end="00:51:50.609" style="s2">interest for them to control the title</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.000" end="00:51:52.350" style="s2">also that&#39;s what happened basically in</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.609" end="00:51:54.600" style="s2">the late 18-hundreds the US government</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.350" end="00:51:56.970" style="s2">said nope promoters can&#39;t control titles</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.600" end="00:51:58.650" style="s2">anymore so the athletic commissions to</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.970" end="00:52:00.660" style="s2">come over the New York State Athletic</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.650" end="00:52:01.650" style="s2">boxing title became the biggest one</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.660" end="00:52:03.420" style="s2">because it was the biggest day to add</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.650" end="00:52:05.220" style="s2">the most money they&#39;re like well this</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.420" end="00:52:06.780" style="s2">this eliminates competition because all</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.220" end="00:52:09.030" style="s2">the boxers have to go to New York to</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.780" end="00:52:10.740" style="s2">fight in order to win real money because</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.030" end="00:52:12.480" style="s2">it&#39;s the biggest title and all the</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.740" end="00:52:14.070" style="s2">promotions and all promoters have to</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.480" end="00:52:15.480" style="s2">promote in New York because if they want</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.070" end="00:52:17.670" style="s2">to make money they have to fight for the</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.480" end="00:52:21.410" style="s2">highest belt so they&#39;re like I was it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.670" end="00:52:26.690" style="s2">not fair it&#39;s not it&#39;s not a free market</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.410" end="00:52:28.100" style="s2">so in 1925 the New York State Athletic</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.690" end="00:52:31.190" style="s2">Commission created a sanction body</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.100" end="00:52:33.830" style="s2">license that&#39;s what the WBC WBO all</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.190" end="00:52:36.110" style="s2">those boxing titles popped up well that</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.830" end="00:52:39.170" style="s2">that&#39;s a huge advantage for those</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.110" end="00:52:41.390" style="s2">athletes to be able to fight for a</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.170" end="00:52:42.830" style="s2">promoter have a title it would be like I</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.390" end="00:52:45.830" style="s2">don&#39;t want to work with you anymore</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.830" end="00:52:48.710" style="s2">leave or hand keep his title and keep</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.830" end="00:52:50.660" style="s2">the title we don&#39;t have that you just</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.710" end="00:52:53.210" style="s2">you just sort of experience this very</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.660" end="00:52:55.400" style="s2">same thing just like with in the recent</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.210" end="00:52:57.890" style="s2">past and to where you were a title</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.400" end="00:52:59.930" style="s2">holder and and then there was like a new</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.890" end="00:53:02.600" style="s2">promoter came again no I was stripped of</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.930" end="00:53:04.160" style="s2">a title yeah I would go with the BB has</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.600" end="00:53:06.800" style="s2">they changed the name they changed your</p>

<p begin="00:53:45.800" end="00:53:51.170" style="s2">they they have everything in-house and</p>

<p begin="00:54:20.870" end="00:54:26.950" style="s2">less but they they puff up the numbers</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.320" end="00:54:29.480" style="s2">by paying the entry level people more</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.950" end="00:54:31.850" style="s2">right and even so man that&#39;s not even</p>

<p begin="00:58:40.170" end="00:58:45.270" style="s2">point you know that yeah there was</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.430" end="00:58:48.660" style="s2">horrible feeling like the second time I</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.270" end="00:58:51.480" style="s2">fought Thiago I was supposed to be a</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.660" end="00:58:53.370" style="s2">title for a title fight a condition the</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.480" end="00:58:56.490" style="s2">winner was supposed to go fight GSP next</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.370" end="00:58:57.750" style="s2">well I fought the fight I dominated I</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.490" end="00:58:59.040" style="s2">thought I&#39;d performed well to one of my</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.750" end="00:59:00.349" style="s2">it&#39;s on my list of one of my best</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.040" end="00:59:02.539" style="s2">performances</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.349" end="00:59:06.380" style="s2">and afterwards at the press conference</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.539" end="00:59:09.410" style="s2">they took the shot away they took away</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.380" end="00:59:11.059" style="s2">and they started pushing this that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.410" end="00:59:15.259" style="s2">when they really started pushing hard on</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.059" end="00:59:17.029" style="s2">the excitement over winning oh is that</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.259" end="00:59:18.529" style="s2">when the boring John four yep that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.029" end="00:59:21.140" style="s2">when I started was leading up to that</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.529" end="00:59:23.479" style="s2">fight was well he maybe he wins fights</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.140" end="00:59:25.609" style="s2">but he&#39;s boring so he doesn&#39;t deserve a</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.479" end="00:59:27.499" style="s2">title shot I think that was the argument</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.609" end="00:59:29.930" style="s2">and they started pushing that that some</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.499" end="00:59:33.200" style="s2">reason that you know entertainment is</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.930" end="00:59:36.289" style="s2">way more important than skill what how</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.200" end="00:59:38.299" style="s2">do you think that the there&#39;s obviously</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.289" end="00:59:39.799" style="s2">just the super casual UFC fan who</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.299" end="00:59:42.349" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really know anything just wants</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.799" end="00:59:44.239" style="s2">to see dudes get beat up yep but I think</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.349" end="00:59:46.549" style="s2">that there&#39;s a pretty solid class of</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.239" end="00:59:48.799" style="s2">guys out there and fans that understand</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.549" end="00:59:52.220" style="s2">understand the sport yeah and I would</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.799" end="00:59:53.989" style="s2">say that your style what may have not</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.220" end="01:00:00.049" style="s2">been as flashy as others but it wasn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:00:21.410" end="01:00:24.589" style="s2">the big things why he lost the title shy</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.910" end="01:00:26.359" style="s2">or whatever after that thing was they</p>

<p begin="01:08:37.040" end="01:08:41.650" style="s2">started to realize that all mainstream</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.080" end="01:08:45.700" style="s2">news media and a lot of media was fake</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.650" end="01:08:47.990" style="s2">because of because of the Iraq war and</p>

<p begin="01:08:50.270" end="01:08:54.320" style="s2">I would take everything with a grain of</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.470" end="01:08:57.470" style="s2">salt if the media was saying something I</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.320" end="01:08:58.700" style="s2">was like eh maybe maybe the stories has</p>

<p begin="01:09:04.850" end="01:09:08.420" style="s2">months into his presidency when he just</p>

<p begin="01:09:40.940" end="01:09:44.990" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting how our lives have</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.859" end="01:09:46.880" style="s2">we&#39;re basically the same age we become</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.990" end="01:09:49.040" style="s2">from the same city and we had similar</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.880" end="01:09:50.839" style="s2">experiences in terms of the politics and</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.040" end="01:09:52.790" style="s2">the away these are raised to believe</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.839" end="01:09:55.700" style="s2">that man we can do whatever they want</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.790" end="01:09:57.890" style="s2">that your skin color doesn&#39;t matter is</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.700" end="01:09:59.600" style="s2">gender that your genitals and what you</p>

<p begin="01:10:01.370" end="01:10:06.090" style="s2">now we&#39;re bad</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.020" end="01:10:08.100" style="s2">if we don&#39;t think they matter like you</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.090" end="01:10:10.020" style="s2">have to put weight on those things it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.100" end="01:10:11.730" style="s2">bizarre and hundreds in backwards to</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.020" end="01:10:14.280" style="s2">what we were taught and brought up as</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.730" end="01:10:16.200" style="s2">right yeah I had a tweet the other day</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.280" end="01:10:18.030" style="s2">do pretty well that was like Gen X the</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.200" end="01:10:20.160" style="s2">only generation ever raised to believe</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.030" end="01:10:23.250" style="s2">neo does not think about gender and race</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.160" end="01:10:25.110" style="s2">yes right you know like everybody before</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.250" end="01:10:27.600" style="s2">us was thinking about it and sort of in</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.110" end="01:10:28.890" style="s2">in the negative ways and sort of like</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.600" end="01:10:31.440" style="s2">trying to get people rights which is a</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.890" end="01:10:32.940" style="s2">good thing and then afterwards after us</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.440" end="01:10:34.530" style="s2">now they&#39;re all just talking about it</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.940" end="01:10:37.470" style="s2">constantly harping on it constantly and</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.530" end="01:10:39.540" style="s2">it&#39;s been such a a whipsaw at least from</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.470" end="01:10:41.040" style="s2">my perspective I mean I I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.540" end="01:10:42.480" style="s2">what it&#39;s like for prior generations but</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.040" end="01:10:43.680" style="s2">it really seems like everything changed</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.480" end="01:10:46.470" style="s2">really fast</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.680" end="01:10:48.720" style="s2">and it changed like starting to me it</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.470" end="01:10:51.210" style="s2">seemed like around 2000 I became aware</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.720" end="01:10:53.490" style="s2">like 2014 or so and then everything just</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.210" end="01:10:56.700" style="s2">sort of whipped around yeah and then and</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.490" end="01:10:58.020" style="s2">then here we are and it&#39;s been a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.700" end="01:11:01.500" style="s2">been really challenging for a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.020" end="01:11:03.300" style="s2">people do you find which way do you and</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.500" end="01:11:04.680" style="s2">maybe I know the answer to this question</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.300" end="01:11:06.840" style="s2">but you don&#39;t know but which way do you</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.680" end="01:11:08.820" style="s2">find like your fellow and then make eyes</p>
