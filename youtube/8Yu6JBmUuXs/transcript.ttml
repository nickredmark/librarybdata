<p begin="00:02:59.530" end="00:03:08.490" style="s2">and we will begin when I say begin begin</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.020" end="00:18:15.559" style="s2">slowly come out of your practice trying</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.000" end="00:18:17.990" style="s2">as best you can dating to great leisure</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.559" end="00:18:20.390" style="s2">cultivated in your practice if your</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.990" end="00:18:23.360" style="s2">everyday consciousness and cognition</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.390" end="00:18:25.720" style="s2">perhaps by reciting the five promises to</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.360" end="00:18:25.720" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.490" end="00:19:45.950" style="s2">all right so we have time for maybe one</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.179" end="00:19:47.390" style="s2">question the reason what I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.950" end="00:19:53.059" style="s2">say only one question is I want to</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.390" end="00:19:55.580" style="s2">answer this question in depth both to</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.059" end="00:19:57.830" style="s2">answer the question trinsic ly to answer</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.580" end="00:20:02.120" style="s2">the question but also extrinsic ly to</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.830" end="00:20:04.309" style="s2">afford what we&#39;re going to be doing</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.120" end="00:20:04.880" style="s2">later when we go through the wisdom of</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.309" end="00:20:09.380" style="s2">Hypatia</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.880" end="00:20:13.400" style="s2">course together so let&#39;s say seminar</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.380" end="00:20:14.990" style="s2">welcome again Aleksey by the way as says</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.400" end="00:20:17.510" style="s2">I can focus one of the pasta but</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.990" end="00:20:19.400" style="s2">struggling and meta keep drifting away</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.510" end="00:20:22.820" style="s2">into conversation with whoever I bring</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.400" end="00:20:25.940" style="s2">up anyway to make it easier yes I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.820" end="00:20:27.740" style="s2">gonna recommend and this is non-buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.940" end="00:20:31.010" style="s2">I&#39;m not gonna be drawing upon the stoic</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.740" end="00:20:34.429" style="s2">tradition stoicism which as I said we</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.010" end="00:20:37.220" style="s2">will come back to and it&#39;s more and more</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.429" end="00:20:40.659" style="s2">deeply the wisdom to Hypatia</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.220" end="00:20:44.179" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna recommend a practice from</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.659" end="00:20:45.890" style="s2">stoicism that is an alternative way to</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.179" end="00:20:49.250" style="s2">get to a place where you can exercise</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.890" end="00:20:52.159" style="s2">meta that has good cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.250" end="00:20:54.710" style="s2">behind it it&#39;s based on control level</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.159" end="00:20:56.960" style="s2">theory as I said I&#39;ll unpack that much</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.710" end="00:21:00.350" style="s2">later in greater detail and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.960" end="00:21:04.520" style="s2">practice of the view from above and so</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.350" end="00:21:09.710" style="s2">what you do is obviously you find your</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.520" end="00:21:12.530" style="s2">core for right and then you see yourself</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.710" end="00:21:14.809" style="s2">as you are like you might imagine Utley</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.530" end="00:21:18.080" style="s2">not in might not not imaginary but</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.809" end="00:21:20.299" style="s2">imagine alee right you&#39;re in this riff</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.080" end="00:21:23.000" style="s2">I&#39;m in this room first-person</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.299" end="00:21:27.289" style="s2">perspective and then I imagine myself</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.000" end="00:21:33.409" style="s2">above this building looking down on this</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.289" end="00:21:37.340" style="s2">body then I rise up higher and I see the</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.409" end="00:21:37.900" style="s2">City of Toronto that&#39;s where I am that</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.340" end="00:21:41.830" style="s2">Kobuk</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.900" end="00:21:41.830" style="s2">and I see the comment</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.450" end="00:21:47.400" style="s2">and I see the whole earth I&#39;m gonna cool</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.800" end="00:21:53.040" style="s2">back</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.400" end="00:21:58.650" style="s2">I started get a sense of the universe as</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.040" end="00:22:04.500" style="s2">a whole I&#39;m seeing the earth within that</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.650" end="00:22:08.880" style="s2">context and I also host open up time not</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.500" end="00:22:11.070" style="s2">just this present moment the deep past</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.880" end="00:22:13.400" style="s2">all the lives that have been lived</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.070" end="00:22:19.860" style="s2">before all the creatures all the</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.400" end="00:22:31.710" style="s2">organisms all the events inanimate and</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.860" end="00:22:36.210" style="s2">animate now feel how that changes the</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.710" end="00:22:42.120" style="s2">sense of self and sense of world a</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.210" end="00:22:45.150" style="s2">process of Co identification and now</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.120" end="00:22:47.670" style="s2">direct meta towards it the reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.150" end="00:22:48.960" style="s2">opening you&#39;ve opened up to the morning</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.670" end="00:22:52.580" style="s2">it&#39;s already been happening you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.960" end="00:22:55.680" style="s2">opened up to the mourners of the world</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.580" end="00:22:58.020" style="s2">perhaps initially yourself seems a son</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.680" end="00:23:00.510" style="s2">but there was something in yourself not</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.020" end="00:23:02.640" style="s2">your ego something in yourself that was</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.510" end="00:23:06.570" style="s2">able to respond there was a more earnest</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.640" end="00:23:09.270" style="s2">in you that could respond to that that</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.570" end="00:23:12.300" style="s2">could be in that that was cyclical</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.270" end="00:23:15.030" style="s2">opening that meta the mourners of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.300" end="00:23:19.230" style="s2">world the more nests of yourself and do</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.030" end="00:23:28.400" style="s2">meta they&#39;re direct meta towards all</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.230" end="00:23:28.400" style="s2">being all beings all and all being</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.880" end="00:23:36.180" style="s2">so try that as a different way of</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.260" end="00:23:38.820" style="s2">getting into meta because it takes you</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.180" end="00:23:40.530" style="s2">out of the direct interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.820" end="00:23:43.200" style="s2">situation that as you said often</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.530" end="00:23:45.990" style="s2">triggers conversations interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.200" end="00:23:49.020" style="s2">emotions are specific socio-cultural</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.990" end="00:23:50.700" style="s2">roles I still think the other meta is a</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.020" end="00:23:54.440" style="s2">very important practice that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.700" end="00:23:57.300" style="s2">taught it to you but the view from above</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.440" end="00:24:00.330" style="s2">practice is independently powerful and</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.300" end="00:24:03.120" style="s2">is a different way of getting into meta</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.330" end="00:24:04.740" style="s2">I&#39;m much more extensive kind of meta and</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.120" end="00:24:06.540" style="s2">really emphasizing the reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.740" end="00:24:10.110" style="s2">opening that&#39;s at the heart of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.540" end="00:24:12.030" style="s2">Buddhist form of meta so try that as I</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.110" end="00:24:14.850" style="s2">said like I said I&#39;m going to recommend</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.030" end="00:24:16.410" style="s2">it to all of us later as we do the</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.850" end="00:24:19.020" style="s2">wisdom of Hypatia of course but this is</p>
