<p begin="00:00:59.100" end="00:01:06.780" style="s2">back and look at the previous teaching</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.210" end="00:01:08.850" style="s2">for teaching sessions so that&#39;s like day</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.780" end="00:01:10.920" style="s2">one day three and Monday&#39;s previous one</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.850" end="00:01:12.720" style="s2">will certainly believe the videos that</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.920" end="00:01:14.189" style="s2">are teaching sessions and you could</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.720" end="00:01:17.159" style="s2">catch up and it was one yesterday as</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.189" end="00:01:19.619" style="s2">well you can catch up on the principles</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.159" end="00:01:24.479" style="s2">that have been taught and then join us</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.619" end="00:01:26.640" style="s2">as you wish we do meet every day at 9:30</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.479" end="00:01:28.170" style="s2">a.m. every weekday we do not meet on</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.640" end="00:01:30.240" style="s2">Saturdays and Sundays we meet every</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.170" end="00:01:33.210" style="s2">weekday Mondays through Fridays and</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.240" end="00:01:35.759" style="s2">there is a teaching session every Monday</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.210" end="00:01:37.259" style="s2">so Monday is Dharma day I will teach you</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.759" end="00:01:38.970" style="s2">a principle take you through an exercise</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.259" end="00:01:40.590" style="s2">so you get a direct perfect spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.970" end="00:01:42.299" style="s2">understanding and explain to you how you</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.590" end="00:01:44.700" style="s2">can incorporate it into your practice</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.299" end="00:01:46.890" style="s2">and build on the previous skills and</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.700" end="00:01:52.229" style="s2">sensitivities that have helped you to</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.890" end="00:01:54.390" style="s2">cultivate so today is not a teaching day</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.229" end="00:01:56.340" style="s2">today is just a sitting day but even on</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.390" end="00:01:58.200" style="s2">the sitting days after we sitting I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.340" end="00:02:00.659" style="s2">do a quick review of where we&#39;re at and</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.200" end="00:02:04.229" style="s2">and there are even on the sitting days</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.659" end="00:02:07.500" style="s2">and as well there will be a period at</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.229" end="00:02:10.140" style="s2">the end for Q&amp;A s so it&#39;s a personal to</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.500" end="00:02:11.459" style="s2">meet in the sits we have good research</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.140" end="00:02:13.140" style="s2">that have you sense that you&#39;re meeting</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.459" end="00:02:13.770" style="s2">with other people you will keep up a</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.140" end="00:02:14.970" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.770" end="00:02:18.000" style="s2">where it&#39;s much more difficult to do</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.970" end="00:02:20.490" style="s2">this on your own and also there will be</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.000" end="00:02:22.410" style="s2">the review and probably most importantly</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.490" end="00:02:24.600" style="s2">while you&#39;re learning there will be the</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.410" end="00:02:28.050" style="s2">Cuban ace so attending the Sitz is also</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.600" end="00:02:31.470" style="s2">a very good idea and one other thing and</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.050" end="00:02:32.790" style="s2">I&#39;m very pleased to see this in the blue</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.470" end="00:02:35.070" style="s2">tradition we talked about the Buddha the</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.790" end="00:02:36.900" style="s2">Dharma and the Sangha assigned as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.070" end="00:02:38.850" style="s2">community and a community is starting to</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.900" end="00:02:41.570" style="s2">form and a community is very very</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.850" end="00:02:49.080" style="s2">helpful for getting people into a</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.570" end="00:02:53.850" style="s2">transformative way of life please set</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.080" end="00:02:56.100" style="s2">your phones to do not disturb so you can</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.850" end="00:03:00.180" style="s2">give your full attention to this</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.100" end="00:03:02.370" style="s2">practice I&#39;ll now do a quick review the</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.180" end="00:03:05.100" style="s2">first lesson was about finding your</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.370" end="00:03:07.470" style="s2">Center but the back side to side with</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.100" end="00:03:09.720" style="s2">your torso in your head if you Center</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.470" end="00:03:11.100" style="s2">really savoring it that centering your</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.720" end="00:03:13.410" style="s2">attention by stepping back and looking</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.100" end="00:03:16.320" style="s2">at your mind labeling your distractions</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.410" end="00:03:17.910" style="s2">with an ING word returning your</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.320" end="00:03:19.980" style="s2">attention to your breath centering your</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.910" end="00:03:22.680" style="s2">attitude neither fighting nor feeding</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.980" end="00:03:24.750" style="s2">that distracted monkey mind the second</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.680" end="00:03:27.330" style="s2">last the second lesson teaching session</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.750" end="00:03:29.550" style="s2">was on rooting the appropriate form of</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.330" end="00:03:31.490" style="s2">relaxation not a relaxation that takes</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.550" end="00:03:34.500" style="s2">you into sleep but that takes you into</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.490" end="00:03:37.020" style="s2">mindfulness and we had you know three</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.500" end="00:03:40.890" style="s2">lines front center and back where we did</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.020" end="00:03:42.930" style="s2">the process of looking listening</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.890" end="00:03:46.440" style="s2">loosening letting it flow letting it go</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.930" end="00:03:49.560" style="s2">finding your route then we learned how</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.440" end="00:03:51.630" style="s2">to find our flow in meditation you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.560" end="00:03:53.459" style="s2">we did that in the abdomen expanding</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.630" end="00:03:55.470" style="s2">both the cross and in interceptive</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.459" end="00:03:57.270" style="s2">awareness noticing different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.470" end="00:04:00.450" style="s2">sensations putting a real challenge on</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.270" end="00:04:02.190" style="s2">our attention really deeply integrating</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.450" end="00:04:05.340" style="s2">introspection and interception together</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.190" end="00:04:07.890" style="s2">we did that here the heart area the</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.340" end="00:04:09.060" style="s2">shoulders the back and then one flow so</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.890" end="00:04:10.680" style="s2">that we have a peripheral awareness</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.060" end="00:04:13.050" style="s2">we&#39;re following the whole of the breath</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.680" end="00:04:15.510" style="s2">through the whole of the torso or focal</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.050" end="00:04:17.220" style="s2">awareness isn&#39;t rdn where we&#39;re without</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.510" end="00:04:19.709" style="s2">force to get without force and yet</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.220" end="00:04:21.150" style="s2">trying to do baby breathing and we have</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.709" end="00:04:22.370" style="s2">a focal awareness here at a field</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.150" end="00:04:24.540" style="s2">awareness throughout our bodies</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.370" end="00:04:26.340" style="s2">yesterday we learned about the proper</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.540" end="00:04:27.240" style="s2">right concentration that it&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.340" end="00:04:29.250" style="s2">Eightfold Path</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.240" end="00:04:31.380" style="s2">that there&#39;s right concentration which</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.250" end="00:04:32.880" style="s2">means there is wrong concentration we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.380" end="00:04:35.460" style="s2">trying to break and it will take time</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.880" end="00:04:37.169" style="s2">while trying to break the habit of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.460" end="00:04:40.199" style="s2">concentration we have Leonard which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.169" end="00:04:41.789" style="s2">people yelling at us pulling our mind in</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.199" end="00:04:45.690" style="s2">from the outside sticking it onto</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.789" end="00:04:48.630" style="s2">something instead we pursued the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.690" end="00:04:51.780" style="s2">the correct form of concentration is a</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.630" end="00:04:54.599" style="s2">constant noticing a constant renewing of</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.780" end="00:04:56.490" style="s2">interest by trying to be you know not</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.599" end="00:04:58.770" style="s2">just being present but being present at</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.490" end="00:05:01.770" style="s2">differing present - but be present in</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.770" end="00:05:03.840" style="s2">and through and with our stimulus</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.770" end="00:05:05.659" style="s2">constantly opening it up with soft</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.840" end="00:05:09.180" style="s2">vigilance the term that Ellen Langer</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.659" end="00:05:12.000" style="s2">introduced we do that of course by after</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.180" end="00:05:14.060" style="s2">we begin meditation we count our breaths</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.000" end="00:05:16.740" style="s2">not because we&#39;re entering into any</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.060" end="00:05:18.270" style="s2">judgment what we&#39;re doing is we count</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.740" end="00:05:19.889" style="s2">our breaths so that when we are</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.270" end="00:05:21.810" style="s2">distracted we take a quick moment and</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.889" end="00:05:25.139" style="s2">note that&#39;s what it was like to have</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.810" end="00:05:29.009" style="s2">that continuity that momentum of</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.139" end="00:05:31.110" style="s2">mindfulness that entering the stream all</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.009" end="00:05:34.199" style="s2">right so that&#39;s the review so please</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.110" end="00:05:36.870" style="s2">remember always in that order to find</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.199" end="00:05:39.240" style="s2">your Center find your route find your</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.870" end="00:05:40.949" style="s2">flow find your focus don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.240" end="00:05:43.139" style="s2">hyperventilate don&#39;t force your</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.949" end="00:05:45.030" style="s2">breathing like you have to sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.139" end="00:05:47.250" style="s2">make minor adjustments if you feel like</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.030" end="00:05:50.219" style="s2">you&#39;ve lost your Center like if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.250" end="00:05:51.810" style="s2">having a more pressing distraction try</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.219" end="00:05:53.550" style="s2">initially like maybe two three or four</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.810" end="00:05:55.590" style="s2">times it&#39;s just label and return to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.550" end="00:05:57.690" style="s2">breath it gets to be too compulsive</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.590" end="00:05:59.130" style="s2">though right remember the principle</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.690" end="00:06:02.099" style="s2">we&#39;re performing ourselves we do not</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.130" end="00:06:04.560" style="s2">want to be merely enduring okay with</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.099" end="00:06:07.979" style="s2">this is an educational situation not an</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.560" end="00:06:10.020" style="s2">imprisonment situation so if like if you</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.979" end="00:06:11.849" style="s2">got a pain and you&#39;ve tried it four</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.020" end="00:06:13.409" style="s2">times to label it return to the bus and</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.849" end="00:06:14.940" style="s2">it&#39;s just getting overwhelming then do</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.409" end="00:06:17.849" style="s2">what you need to do to alleviate it and</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.940" end="00:06:20.250" style="s2">that return to your breath all right I</p>

<p begin="00:22:08.040" end="00:22:12.630" style="s2">I guess I haven&#39;t really thought about</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.010" end="00:22:16.830" style="s2">it that much</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.630" end="00:22:19.020" style="s2">I also go through a phase where I&#39;ll be</p>

<p begin="00:22:27.360" end="00:22:31.830" style="s2">distancing I&#39;m sort of trying to go</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.400" end="00:22:34.680" style="s2">through all of my wardrobe right now to</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.830" end="00:22:37.410" style="s2">reduce the laundry I live in an</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.680" end="00:22:38.940" style="s2">apartment and so the laundry is communal</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.410" end="00:22:41.070" style="s2">so I have to stretch things out to try</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.940" end="00:22:44.730" style="s2">and reduce social distancing so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.070" end="00:22:48.750" style="s2">why you&#39;ll see maybe proud a variety of</p>

<p begin="00:22:56.190" end="00:23:05.450" style="s2">influenced by other teachers I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.950" end="00:23:07.170" style="s2">teaching both I was taught as I said by</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.450" end="00:23:10.920" style="s2">what was called the Taichi and</p>

<p begin="00:23:31.020" end="00:23:39.270" style="s2">and and bringing that to bear so it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:23:53.400" end="00:24:00.419" style="s2">there&#39;s sort of three three sources</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.169" end="00:24:06.870" style="s2">coming together and I hope a way that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:24:33.299" end="00:24:39.660" style="s2">store fact it stores the context in</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.730" end="00:24:42.179" style="s2">which facts are stored and it fuses</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.660" end="00:24:45.330" style="s2">those together and it really like their</p>

<p begin="00:24:52.200" end="00:24:57.270" style="s2">so your brain will try like when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.630" end="00:25:00.450" style="s2">trying to get in between falling asleep</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.270" end="00:25:03.419" style="s2">which is familiar to you and moving</p>

<p begin="00:25:14.220" end="00:25:19.500" style="s2">there&#39;ll be quite a bit of like Oh to</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.049" end="00:25:21.690" style="s2">try and get you out truck I know what</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.500" end="00:25:24.059" style="s2">that&#39;s like and it&#39;s very familiar to</p>

<p begin="00:25:27.450" end="00:25:31.559" style="s2">be mindful of it and then try to go</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.130" end="00:25:33.540" style="s2">right back in if you can&#39;t and then next</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.559" end="00:25:35.250" style="s2">time you get the impulse see if you can</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.540" end="00:25:36.870" style="s2">label that for maybe four or five</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.250" end="00:25:38.760" style="s2">breaths before you have to do it into it</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.870" end="00:25:41.520" style="s2">and again like always slowly try to</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.760" end="00:25:46.919" style="s2">erode away the resistance until you</p>

<p begin="00:25:52.429" end="00:26:03.059" style="s2">no I do not I suspect it might not</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.169" end="00:26:07.739" style="s2">because I what I know about this is it</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.059" end="00:26:11.669" style="s2">tends to have a tunneling effect on on</p>

<p begin="00:26:11.669" end="00:26:16.950" style="s2">improving your focus but generally what</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.460" end="00:26:20.039" style="s2">it&#39;s doing is it&#39;s actually reducing the</p>

<p begin="00:26:20.039" end="00:26:25.830" style="s2">manner and it tends to perhaps conduced</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.659" end="00:26:28.739" style="s2">towards being a little bit more a</p>

<p begin="00:26:31.559" end="00:26:40.470" style="s2">thirdly I strongly recommend trying not</p>

<p begin="00:29:24.519" end="00:29:27.129" style="s2">and I&#39;m having trouble coaxing the puppy</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.109" end="00:29:29.440" style="s2">back to the breath do you have any</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.129" end="00:29:32.190" style="s2">suggestions for dealing with that one of</p>

<p begin="00:29:34.809" end="00:29:41.580" style="s2">contemplation and then the day I the</p>

<p begin="00:29:48.399" end="00:29:55.059" style="s2">then maybe you know reroute tap into the</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.859" end="00:29:57.580" style="s2">fact that you&#39;ve started to build up</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.059" end="00:29:59.739" style="s2">some skilled momentum for the rooting</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.580" end="00:30:01.509" style="s2">and the eccentric recenter even if</p>

<p begin="00:30:13.809" end="00:30:18.429" style="s2">through time but we will have specific</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.059" end="00:30:20.619" style="s2">things that I will teach you about how</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.429" end="00:30:22.720" style="s2">to deal with both distractions hindrance</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.619" end="00:30:23.370" style="s2">and hindrances things that cause you to</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.720" end="00:30:27.450" style="s2">resist</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.370" end="00:30:29.370" style="s2">yep your practice Andre affair as well</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.450" end="00:30:30.960" style="s2">as getting led away from focusing on my</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.370" end="00:30:32.790" style="s2">breath my my market and I realize that</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.960" end="00:30:34.500" style="s2">labeling and returning I&#39;ve also know</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.790" end="00:30:35.910" style="s2">that I tend to zone out and almost</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.500" end="00:30:36.420" style="s2">forget that I&#39;m meditating is that I</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.910" end="00:30:39.120" style="s2">can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.420" end="00:30:41.190" style="s2">is that okay should I label zoning out</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.120" end="00:30:42.870" style="s2">forgetting yes label that and catching</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.190" end="00:30:45.150" style="s2">yourself from zoning out that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.870" end="00:30:47.460" style="s2">that&#39;s a really that&#39;s sort of you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.150" end="00:30:50.010" style="s2">that&#39;s the trippy monkeymod instead of</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.460" end="00:30:52.860" style="s2">chattering that&#39;s distraction it sort of</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.010" end="00:30:55.650" style="s2">lows you into right zoning out and</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.860" end="00:30:56.280" style="s2">losing that continuity of contact with</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.650" end="00:30:58.620" style="s2">your breath</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.280" end="00:31:01.800" style="s2">definitely label that come back you</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.620" end="00:31:03.750" style="s2">might want to reengage flow because it</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.800" end="00:31:12.059" style="s2">might be also that your brain is trying</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.750" end="00:31:13.920" style="s2">to take you towards sleep okay this is</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.059" end="00:31:15.270" style="s2">from McCready any tips on keeping your</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.920" end="00:31:16.350" style="s2">breath natural when I&#39;m focusing on</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.270" end="00:31:17.850" style="s2">their breath I tend to force my</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.350" end="00:31:19.590" style="s2">breathing and what I noticed I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.850" end="00:31:21.450" style="s2">returned to natural breathing I start to</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.590" end="00:31:26.970" style="s2">force it again yeah so this is a</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.450" end="00:31:29.850" style="s2">difficulty some people face so so what</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.970" end="00:31:30.960" style="s2">are the things that recommend this for</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.850" end="00:31:33.059" style="s2">other reasons but one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.960" end="00:31:36.120" style="s2">that&#39;s very helpful for this is to get</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.059" end="00:31:38.520" style="s2">into a moving mindfulness practice where</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.120" end="00:31:41.400" style="s2">you Center your attention where your</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.520" end="00:31:42.960" style="s2">breath will be regulated right with the</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.400" end="00:31:44.820" style="s2">practice but the focus of your attention</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.960" end="00:31:47.730" style="s2">for examples on movement I strongly</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.820" end="00:31:50.220" style="s2">recommend and there&#39;s online courses you</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.730" end="00:31:52.470" style="s2">take up some cheek on or some Tai Chi</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.220" end="00:31:55.070" style="s2">because those moving mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.470" end="00:31:57.630" style="s2">practices help to break up that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.070" end="00:32:00.210" style="s2">self-fulfilling prophecy of anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.630" end="00:32:03.990" style="s2">around the breath and then when she get</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.210" end="00:32:05.370" style="s2">that moving mindfulness and you can sort</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.990" end="00:32:07.440" style="s2">of focus on your body in a different way</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.370" end="00:32:09.150" style="s2">and your your breathing is natural you</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.440" end="00:32:10.650" style="s2">can build up a different association</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.150" end="00:32:13.950" style="s2">between mindfulness and breath in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.650" end="00:32:17.630" style="s2">body so if this is a pervasive issue for</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.950" end="00:32:19.520" style="s2">you you need to consider taking that out</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.630" end="00:32:22.440" style="s2">Nick Kennedy</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.520" end="00:32:24.540" style="s2">hi Nick good to see you again should our</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.440" end="00:32:26.550" style="s2">counting be resting at a count of ten or</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.540" end="00:32:29.190" style="s2">continuent until we are away from it</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.550" end="00:32:30.840" style="s2">when should we go back to only following</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.190" end="00:32:34.350" style="s2">their breath yeah accounted</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.840" end="00:32:37.710" style="s2">10 is a good idea I think that&#39;s good if</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.350" end="00:32:39.300" style="s2">you feel that you get it if I can&#39;t tell</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.710" end="00:32:41.640" style="s2">you this but when you get that sense</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.300" end="00:32:43.670" style="s2">that you&#39;re getting that momentum of</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.640" end="00:32:45.960" style="s2">mindfulness that it starts becoming a</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.670" end="00:32:48.090" style="s2">self-organizing process rather than a</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.960" end="00:32:50.010" style="s2">process you&#39;re forcing into place it</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.090" end="00:32:51.660" style="s2">won&#39;t ever it with the wheel a long time</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.010" end="00:32:53.570" style="s2">before that&#39;s completely the case but if</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.660" end="00:32:56.370" style="s2">you got a sense that at least some of</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.570" end="00:33:00.360" style="s2">your attention is now self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.370" end="00:33:03.720" style="s2">rather than forced then that&#39;s you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.360" end="00:33:05.160" style="s2">counted for long enough so sorry I</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.720" end="00:33:07.010" style="s2">rushed through some of those questions</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.160" end="00:33:09.210" style="s2">that are not trying to be insensitive I</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.010" end="00:33:10.460" style="s2">was trying to do today is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.210" end="00:33:14.010" style="s2">answer as many questions as I can</p>
