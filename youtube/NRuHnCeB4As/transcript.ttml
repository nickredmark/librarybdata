<p begin="00:01:01.289" end="00:01:11.780" style="s2">so I am an artist and I&#39;m involved in</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.400" end="00:01:15.479" style="s2">the arts community I am one half of a</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.780" end="00:01:17.070" style="s2">small company named legend ear in the US</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.479" end="00:01:19.229" style="s2">and we are building an art community</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.070" end="00:01:22.830" style="s2">around the philosophy that we call</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.229" end="00:01:26.460" style="s2">embedded art or the embedded artist that</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.830" end="00:01:29.040" style="s2">deals with problems related to artists</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.460" end="00:01:31.380" style="s2">being disconnected from self</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.040" end="00:01:33.810" style="s2">disconnected from planet disconnected</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.380" end="00:01:36.900" style="s2">from community and the effect that this</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.810" end="00:01:38.820" style="s2">has had on young artists that are</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.900" end="00:01:40.350" style="s2">growing up to be illustrators or working</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.820" end="00:01:42.450" style="s2">in entertainment and stuff like that and</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.350" end="00:01:45.869" style="s2">so we deal with a number of issues</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.450" end="00:01:48.930" style="s2">around these communities being stuck</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.869" end="00:01:51.720" style="s2">behind computers being validating the</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.930" end="00:01:53.549" style="s2">work that they do through watching other</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.720" end="00:01:55.049" style="s2">artists on Instagram and so on and we</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.549" end="00:01:56.880" style="s2">encourage them to get back out into the</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.049" end="00:02:00.380" style="s2">world whether that&#39;s in nature or inner</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.880" end="00:02:04.049" style="s2">cities or in families or in any context</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.380" end="00:02:05.189" style="s2">but to investigate the kinds of cyclic</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.049" end="00:02:08.009" style="s2">relationships that they&#39;re establishing</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.189" end="00:02:10.200" style="s2">through their practice rather than going</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.009" end="00:02:11.940" style="s2">somewhere extracting something making</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.200" end="00:02:13.890" style="s2">art about it and showing it in a gallery</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.940" end="00:02:15.870" style="s2">it&#39;s about actually creating</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.890" end="00:02:18.209" style="s2">projects where that art feeds back into</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.870" end="00:02:20.580" style="s2">the community strengthens the community</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.209" end="00:02:23.040" style="s2">strengthens themselves physically</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.580" end="00:02:25.380" style="s2">mentally so we&#39;re at a where quite a</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.040" end="00:02:27.000" style="s2">beginning stage but with on running</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.380" end="00:02:30.180" style="s2">events and building our community</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.000" end="00:02:32.010" style="s2">directly we&#39;ve done four events in</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.180" end="00:02:34.770" style="s2">ditional in different national parks in</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.010" end="00:02:36.570" style="s2">the US and Canada of about 50</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.770" end="00:02:38.730" style="s2">participants each where we went out for</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.570" end="00:02:40.290" style="s2">a week and went hiking with artists and</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.730" end="00:02:42.630" style="s2">did a lot of talking about our</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.290" end="00:02:48.660" style="s2">industries and how they could be better</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.630" end="00:02:50.700" style="s2">and now because of this situation in in</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.660" end="00:02:53.700" style="s2">alignment with our what we were already</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.700" end="00:02:56.160" style="s2">planning to do we&#39;re kind of speeding up</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.700" end="00:02:58.290" style="s2">our plans for our online community and</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.160" end="00:02:59.910" style="s2">to get those people that have come to</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.290" end="00:03:02.400" style="s2">events and who understand the philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.910" end="00:03:05.670" style="s2">that we&#39;re we&#39;re talking about to begin</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.400" end="00:03:08.580" style="s2">to extend those ideas outwards and offer</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.670" end="00:03:10.650" style="s2">support the young artists and also to</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.580" end="00:03:12.989" style="s2">support a broader community with an art</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.650" end="00:03:14.790" style="s2">practice people that may not have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.989" end="00:03:18.150" style="s2">creative outlet may not write or make</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.790" end="00:03:20.010" style="s2">music or draw do anything like that and</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.150" end="00:03:23.880" style="s2">right now I&#39;m looking at the potential</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.010" end="00:03:26.370" style="s2">for some non verbal and non intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.880" end="00:03:28.920" style="s2">artistic modalities to be a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.370" end="00:03:30.600" style="s2">pressure valve for what people are going</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.920" end="00:03:32.190" style="s2">to be going through emotionally and</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.600" end="00:03:34.860" style="s2">psychologically over the next couple of</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.190" end="00:03:36.989" style="s2">months so giving people just very basic</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.860" end="00:03:39.630" style="s2">practices of how to keep a sketchbook or</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.989" end="00:03:41.850" style="s2">a journal or you know do some</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.630" end="00:03:43.709" style="s2">improvisation just as a way to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.850" end="00:03:47.700" style="s2">release that energy and record their</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.709" end="00:03:49.590" style="s2">thoughts and make sense over time so</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.700" end="00:03:53.190" style="s2">that&#39;s a little bit about me and my</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.590" end="00:03:54.870" style="s2">community I love that I love I love the</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.190" end="00:03:56.760" style="s2">use of art to build community I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.870" end="00:03:58.470" style="s2">think that&#39;s fundamentally what</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.760" end="00:04:00.269" style="s2">community is about is doing stuff</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.470" end="00:04:01.590" style="s2">together which feels meaningful and</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.269" end="00:04:03.540" style="s2">worthwhile right I mean that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.590" end="00:04:06.690" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s I think not a bad</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.540" end="00:04:07.890" style="s2">definition of what community is Kevin</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.690" end="00:04:10.049" style="s2">and I were on a call recently we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.890" end="00:04:12.690" style="s2">talking about singing as a mode for</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.049" end="00:04:15.900" style="s2">better as a modality through which one</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.690" end="00:04:17.400" style="s2">could build community and you know we</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.900" end="00:04:18.930" style="s2">were actually talking about it in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.400" end="00:04:20.310" style="s2">context of squashing flattening</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.930" end="00:04:22.289" style="s2">hierarchies right because when you come</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.310" end="00:04:23.760" style="s2">together and sing where you exist in any</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.289" end="00:04:26.340" style="s2">particular hierarchy becomes completely</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.760" end="00:04:27.450" style="s2">irrelevant right it takes you out of all</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.340" end="00:04:29.670" style="s2">of that</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.450" end="00:04:30.840" style="s2">so yeah I think art does the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.670" end="00:04:32.070" style="s2">I&#39;m really interested in talking to you</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.840" end="00:04:33.270" style="s2">more Adam this is not the time and place</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.070" end="00:04:37.650" style="s2">but I&#39;m really interested in talking to</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.270" end="00:04:42.060" style="s2">you more about what you&#39;re doing did we</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.650" end="00:04:44.040" style="s2">lose do believe yeah I&#39;m not sure she</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.060" end="00:04:45.600" style="s2">ducked out for something or we seem to</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.040" end="00:04:48.750" style="s2">be gaining at State the other there</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.600" end="00:04:50.460" style="s2">there I&#39;m playing around so I thought</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.750" end="00:04:51.930" style="s2">that only Eric would be joining me for</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.460" end="00:04:54.210" style="s2">this conversation because nobody else</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.930" end="00:04:55.770" style="s2">else RSVP&#39;d if I had known never gonna</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.210" end="00:04:57.300" style="s2">be this many people I would have</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.770" end="00:04:59.100" style="s2">switched it on to zoom and then we would</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.300" end="00:05:00.150" style="s2">have broken up into two groups because</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.100" end="00:05:02.670" style="s2">it&#39;s too hard to have this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.150" end="00:05:03.870" style="s2">with even six people but let alone more</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.670" end="00:05:05.100" style="s2">than s so just for everyone to know</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.870" end="00:05:07.170" style="s2">there is a Facebook group called</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.100" end="00:05:08.640" style="s2">solution raising and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.170" end="00:05:10.710" style="s2">spreadsheet so we can sign up and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.640" end="00:05:12.360" style="s2">we can more coordinate how to have these</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.710" end="00:05:14.460" style="s2">conversations going to have like a fun</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.360" end="00:05:16.080" style="s2">fun conversation for the people having</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.460" end="00:05:18.300" style="s2">the conversation and have it be</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.080" end="00:05:26.550" style="s2">generative which is easier with less</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.300" end="00:05:27.900" style="s2">people so I&#39;m gonna drop you off to zoom</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.550" end="00:05:29.040" style="s2">right now could we don&#39;t still do that</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.900" end="00:05:31.740" style="s2">is there any reason we couldn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.040" end="00:05:33.690" style="s2">already live online so we&#39;ll just call</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.740" end="00:05:38.400" style="s2">this what it what it is for now and see</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.690" end="00:05:40.260" style="s2">about the issue is Stacy&#39;s not on camera</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.400" end="00:05:41.760" style="s2">so even if you&#39;re on the bottom I can</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.260" end="00:05:43.170" style="s2">still see you if you raise your hand and</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.760" end="00:05:44.670" style="s2">you have something you want to say I can</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.170" end="00:05:46.560" style="s2">rotate us out and what they&#39;ll see how</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.670" end="00:05:50.280" style="s2">it works so maybe we&#39;ll try to be more</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.560" end="00:05:51.990" style="s2">succinct and more just because the</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.280" end="00:05:55.740" style="s2">videos also when you&#39;re practicing rule</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.990" end="00:05:56.940" style="s2">omega2 to be doing um a little bit like</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.740" end="00:05:58.140" style="s2">the glass feed game where you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.940" end="00:05:59.700" style="s2">thinking what you&#39;re gonna say and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.140" end="00:06:01.610" style="s2">say it more succinctly and not put all</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.700" end="00:06:05.070" style="s2">the filler but you know I&#39;m not great at</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.610" end="00:06:06.030" style="s2">conversation so talking about we only</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.070" end="00:06:07.320" style="s2">have 10 more minutes to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.030" end="00:06:08.370" style="s2">what&#39;s currently happening in community</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.320" end="00:06:10.110" style="s2">and the most which phone to what</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.370" end="00:06:13.410" style="s2">community could look like in a better</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.110" end="00:06:16.200" style="s2">world but so I vote I guess we can&#39;t add</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.410" end="00:06:18.720" style="s2">Stacy now one more very very quick thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.200" end="00:06:19.980" style="s2">in in terms of just putting the</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.720" end="00:06:22.020" style="s2">community thing in context of</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.980" end="00:06:23.850" style="s2">coronavirus this everyone having to stay</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.020" end="00:06:25.290" style="s2">home could be really really good for</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.850" end="00:06:26.610" style="s2">local community building it could be a</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.290" end="00:06:28.410" style="s2">really positive officer this whole</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.610" end="00:06:30.170" style="s2">coronavirus thing that was all I want to</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.410" end="00:06:33.330" style="s2">say yeah I agree</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.170" end="00:06:35.670" style="s2">before coronavirus ever hit us or at</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.330" end="00:06:38.400" style="s2">least hit more close to home for me</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.670" end="00:06:40.350" style="s2">community is both like where I find my</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.400" end="00:06:40.740" style="s2">solace I have a lot of community in my</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.350" end="00:06:42.870" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.740" end="00:06:44.669" style="s2">even before I didn&#39;t even necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.870" end="00:06:46.650" style="s2">realize where I had community in my life</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.669" end="00:06:48.360" style="s2">because I wanted it to look exactly like</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.650" end="00:06:49.740" style="s2">it did online like I want our story</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.360" end="00:06:52.139" style="s2">exactly like I did on the media like I</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.740" end="00:06:54.300" style="s2">wanted friends I wanted I wanted friends</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.139" end="00:06:55.680" style="s2">I wanted like six core people that hung</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.300" end="00:06:57.000" style="s2">out together all the time even though</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.680" end="00:07:00.270" style="s2">that&#39;s not actually conducive with my</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.000" end="00:07:01.710" style="s2">personality but for me the difficult</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.270" end="00:07:04.680" style="s2">part about community right now is that</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.710" end="00:07:06.810" style="s2">it is on the individual to find it so we</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.680" end="00:07:08.370" style="s2">have to fake our personalities to a</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.810" end="00:07:10.169" style="s2">certain degree in order to be palatable</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.370" end="00:07:12.240" style="s2">to the masses in order to find people so</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.169" end="00:07:14.880" style="s2">we can be our true selves and then start</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.240" end="00:07:17.460" style="s2">seeing are we actually compatible and I</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.880" end="00:07:20.280" style="s2">would like I think that that is already</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.460" end="00:07:21.539" style="s2">broken because we enjoy authentic seeing</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.280" end="00:07:23.990" style="s2">other people and the more we&#39;re able to</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.539" end="00:07:26.789" style="s2">be authentic and then find out are</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.990" end="00:07:28.190" style="s2">people that we align with the better we</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.789" end="00:07:30.210" style="s2">are going to be happier and the better</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.190" end="00:07:33.889" style="s2">cohesion our groups are gonna have I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.210" end="00:07:33.889" style="s2">gonna let the people speak televisions</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.050" end="00:07:47.460" style="s2">hmm so I guess what I&#39;m doing for</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.780" end="00:07:53.940" style="s2">community of recently has been very</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.460" end="00:07:55.949" style="s2">online focused all right no last number</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.940" end="00:07:57.509" style="s2">of years I became pretty like housebound</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.949" end="00:07:59.219" style="s2">and reclusive from having been pretty</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.509" end="00:08:03.780" style="s2">gregarious and that flowed into online</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.219" end="00:08:05.520" style="s2">and in reaching out online here in</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.780" end="00:08:08.729" style="s2">recent months it&#39;s turned into like an</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.520" end="00:08:10.710" style="s2">active focus of making an effort to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.729" end="00:08:13.139" style="s2">in touch and you know connect through</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.710" end="00:08:16.050" style="s2">Facebook groups and this cords actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.139" end="00:08:17.819" style="s2">been a great one for me a friend Richie</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.050" end="00:08:19.650" style="s2">and some friends of him started a game</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.819" end="00:08:21.900" style="s2">be parallax group a while back that a</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.650" end="00:08:24.060" style="s2">lot of relationships formed through and</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.900" end="00:08:27.479" style="s2">some of us have been meeting up on a</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.060" end="00:08:28.949" style="s2">weekly and now by monthly basis on just</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.479" end="00:08:30.630" style="s2">for personal conversations it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.949" end="00:08:32.909" style="s2">connect and form individual community</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.630" end="00:08:34.039" style="s2">that spurred off of that and grew out of</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.909" end="00:08:37.079" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.039" end="00:08:39.719" style="s2">and I&#39;ve just found myself even just</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.079" end="00:08:41.010" style="s2">being here for friends you know somebody</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.719" end="00:08:42.810" style="s2">I hadn&#39;t talked to in years got hold me</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.010" end="00:08:43.950" style="s2">the other day and had stuff on their</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.810" end="00:08:45.779" style="s2">mind and they wanted somebody they knew</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.950" end="00:08:49.050" style="s2">that had a philosophical bent to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.779" end="00:08:52.610" style="s2">and you know I pop to mind and we talked</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.050" end="00:08:52.610" style="s2">for three and a half hours or something</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.240" end="00:08:58.480" style="s2">right now specifically we have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.770" end="00:09:00.640" style="s2">there&#39;s some even going around it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.480" end="00:09:02.290" style="s2">introverts put down your book and checks</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.640" end="00:09:04.780" style="s2">all your extrovert friends they are not</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.290" end="00:09:06.670" style="s2">doing okay and I know when I had to</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.780" end="00:09:08.460" style="s2">start self isolating non-for virus</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.670" end="00:09:12.850" style="s2">reasons but for mental health and</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.460" end="00:09:14.710" style="s2">sensory reason I even though I&#39;m an</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.850" end="00:09:17.890" style="s2">introvert I went through a long period</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.710" end="00:09:18.940" style="s2">of needing something some kind of human</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.890" end="00:09:20.590" style="s2">connection and then when I would get</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.940" end="00:09:22.180" style="s2">together with people I had like all of</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.590" end="00:09:24.640" style="s2">this puppy energy that I was just like</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.180" end="00:09:26.440" style="s2">putting all over everyone and so it was</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.640" end="00:09:27.640" style="s2">a hard to find that balance of like okay</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.440" end="00:09:29.530" style="s2">I still need some kind of outside</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.640" end="00:09:32.320" style="s2">connection but I need to remain at home</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.530" end="00:09:33.790" style="s2">and then finding online finding online</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.320" end="00:09:35.950" style="s2">real community that I communicate with</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.790" end="00:09:37.180" style="s2">online gives me the best of both worlds</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.950" end="00:09:38.710" style="s2">because then when I do show up in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.180" end="00:09:41.830" style="s2">real world in a few months when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.710" end="00:09:43.270" style="s2">all back to doing that then I can talk</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.830" end="00:09:45.130" style="s2">about what they want to talk about and</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.270" end="00:09:46.900" style="s2">not just saving the world and game B</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.130" end="00:09:49.330" style="s2">type stuff because I found people to</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.900" end="00:09:54.490" style="s2">talk about that with because it&#39;s a more</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.330" end="00:09:56.080" style="s2">I think it&#39;s like focused I found people</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.490" end="00:10:00.570" style="s2">to talk about my special interest with</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.080" end="00:10:03.400" style="s2">and so I can talk about other things I</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.570" end="00:10:05.380" style="s2">resonate with that strongly by reducing</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.400" end="00:10:13.120" style="s2">the urgency of it in other contexts and</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.380" end="00:10:16.000" style="s2">yeah I felt that for me I have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.120" end="00:10:18.100" style="s2">community that I participate in that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.000" end="00:10:22.740" style="s2">not online but I but I have been moving</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.100" end="00:10:26.140" style="s2">more towards online even prior to</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.740" end="00:10:28.840" style="s2">coronavirus because I had that same</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.140" end="00:10:30.760" style="s2">problem of like the people I was around</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.840" end="00:10:32.320" style="s2">I couldn&#39;t talk about the subjects that</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.760" end="00:10:36.760" style="s2">I wanted to you know that I was</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.320" end="00:10:39.220" style="s2">interested in and so I would get</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.760" end="00:10:40.720" style="s2">painfully bored and so like I just</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.220" end="00:10:42.580" style="s2">couldn&#39;t participate in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.720" end="00:10:45.370" style="s2">conversations that people wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.580" end="00:10:50.170" style="s2">participate in real in real time but um</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.370" end="00:10:52.450" style="s2">you know I spoken in this group in these</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.170" end="00:10:54.510" style="s2">groups before about spending a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.450" end="00:11:01.090" style="s2">time in like 12-step groups and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.510" end="00:11:06.579" style="s2">and how that is definitely a place where</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.090" end="00:11:08.920" style="s2">I can go and be myself and like</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.579" end="00:11:09.910" style="s2">show everything that&#39;s you knows</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.920" end="00:11:13.929" style="s2">everything that&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.910" end="00:11:15.670" style="s2">within these hour-long you know meetings</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.929" end="00:11:16.089" style="s2">and there&#39;s something to be said about</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.670" end="00:11:19.720" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.089" end="00:11:22.720" style="s2">and yesterday I got to participate in</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.720" end="00:11:24.369" style="s2">something that was hosted by rebel</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.720" end="00:11:27.220" style="s2">wisdom that was kind of a similar type</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.369" end="00:11:28.509" style="s2">feel and I and I really like that</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.220" end="00:11:30.879" style="s2">because it was talking about more than</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.509" end="00:11:36.569" style="s2">just what we talked about in 12-step</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.879" end="00:11:40.029" style="s2">groups and you know kind of figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.569" end="00:11:46.199" style="s2">like how do you set you know how do you</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.029" end="00:11:49.149" style="s2">show up authentically and with you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.199" end="00:11:52.480" style="s2">bringing everything that you are into a</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.149" end="00:11:57.329" style="s2">group and not scaring the out of</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.480" end="00:11:57.329" style="s2">people or you know running them off and</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.360" end="00:12:02.439" style="s2">and and how do you you know I mean art</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.639" end="00:12:05.139" style="s2">is a tremendous way of bringing people</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.439" end="00:12:06.910" style="s2">together suffering is another way of</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.139" end="00:12:08.679" style="s2">bringing people together that&#39;s what you</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.910" end="00:12:10.809" style="s2">know 12-step is is people coming</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.679" end="00:12:16.540" style="s2">together around you know very deep</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.809" end="00:12:24.369" style="s2">painful painful stuff and but community</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.540" end="00:12:27.009" style="s2">like other than 12-step I haven&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.369" end="00:12:31.089" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s hard to and that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.009" end="00:12:32.559" style="s2">specific format it&#39;s hard it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.089" end="00:12:34.629" style="s2">find community in the real world because</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.559" end="00:12:37.449" style="s2">I it&#39;s really hard to get along with</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.629" end="00:12:43.299" style="s2">people or let me rephrase that</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.449" end="00:12:45.819" style="s2">I find people very annoying and but here</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.299" end="00:12:48.249" style="s2">in this ike it&#39;s like it&#39;s a limited</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.819" end="00:12:50.619" style="s2">amount of input and so I can handle this</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.249" end="00:12:54.160" style="s2">I can handle being an account in a group</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.619" end="00:12:56.470" style="s2">of six people versus in the real world I</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.160" end="00:12:59.259" style="s2">just get flat overwhelmed and have to</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.470" end="00:13:01.419" style="s2">run end up running away and so like</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.259" end="00:13:04.149" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s I think for a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.419" end="00:13:08.559" style="s2">people there are a lot of a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.149" end="00:13:11.679" style="s2">people like me introverts who actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.559" end="00:13:15.009" style="s2">aren&#39;t introvert but we get overwhelmed</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.679" end="00:13:18.220" style="s2">by being around people you know about</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.009" end="00:13:20.350" style="s2">too much stimulus and so like this</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.220" end="00:13:22.180" style="s2">opportunity of everybody being forced</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.350" end="00:13:24.430" style="s2">communicate this way I think is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.180" end="00:13:31.050" style="s2">probably change how people interact and</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.430" end="00:13:34.990" style="s2">I like that oh sorry no you go ahead</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.050" end="00:13:36.190" style="s2">and I I wanted to just anecdotally share</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.990" end="00:13:39.460" style="s2">something that happened this morning</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.190" end="00:13:42.960" style="s2">I&#39;ve been doing a three-week morning</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.460" end="00:13:46.780" style="s2">challenge pranayama breathing related</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.960" end="00:13:48.280" style="s2">physically in a studio here in Berlin we</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.780" end="00:13:51.580" style="s2">finished the first week and then we had</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.280" end="00:13:56.770" style="s2">to move to online because we&#39;ve entered</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.580" end="00:13:59.350" style="s2">the semi lockdown and this morning was</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.770" end="00:14:01.360" style="s2">the first of the online sessions and I</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.350" end="00:14:03.790" style="s2">noticed two responses from people</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.360" end="00:14:05.830" style="s2">there&#39;s a group of about 25 and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.790" end="00:14:07.090" style="s2">first thing that came up was in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.830" end="00:14:10.060" style="s2">beginning when everyone logged on</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.090" end="00:14:12.610" style="s2">someone said this is amazing this is the</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.060" end="00:14:14.800" style="s2">first time since we started this a week</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.610" end="00:14:16.930" style="s2">ago that we&#39;ve actually looked at each</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.800" end="00:14:18.970" style="s2">other&#39;s faces so there was a physical</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.930" end="00:14:20.800" style="s2">connection of coming into that studio</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.970" end="00:14:22.630" style="s2">together every morning and you did feel</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.800" end="00:14:25.930" style="s2">like you were there with other people</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.630" end="00:14:27.580" style="s2">but it was only when we came online that</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.930" end="00:14:29.710" style="s2">we actually acknowledged that we hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.580" end="00:14:32.460" style="s2">really sat face to face and so there was</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.710" end="00:14:34.900" style="s2">a surprising amount of connection</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.460" end="00:14:36.820" style="s2">through that digital medium that we</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.900" end="00:14:38.830" style="s2">didn&#39;t expect just because our heads</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.820" end="00:14:40.000" style="s2">were close to the cameras but then the</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.830" end="00:14:41.680" style="s2">other thing that happened was a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.000" end="00:14:43.630" style="s2">people felt like throughout the class</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.680" end="00:14:45.940" style="s2">they started to feel like they were</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.630" end="00:14:48.070" style="s2">watching a YouTube video and so there</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.940" end="00:14:50.650" style="s2">was this kind of flicking between</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.070" end="00:14:52.900" style="s2">feeling presence of that community and</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.650" end="00:14:54.790" style="s2">then kind of tuning out because it felt</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.900" end="00:14:56.770" style="s2">like something pre-recorded that you</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.790" end="00:14:58.900" style="s2">were just watching the teacher do and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.770" end="00:15:00.730" style="s2">I think there&#39;s there&#39;s something really</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.900" end="00:15:04.060" style="s2">interesting in the potential of these</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.730" end="00:15:06.400" style="s2">crossover digital and offline things</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.060" end="00:15:08.290" style="s2">that&#39;s even more interesting than you</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.400" end="00:15:09.640" style="s2">know I have my my real life friends and</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.290" end="00:15:11.920" style="s2">that I have these online communities and</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.640" end="00:15:14.740" style="s2">they both serve these very unique</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.920" end="00:15:17.140" style="s2">purposes there&#39;s also something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.740" end="00:15:19.450" style="s2">happening uniquely now we&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.140" end="00:15:21.610" style="s2">tight-knit offline communities are</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.450" end="00:15:24.070" style="s2">transitioning online and being like wow</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.610" end="00:15:25.510" style="s2">this is we&#39;re sharing ideas in a new way</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.070" end="00:15:27.130" style="s2">we&#39;re sharing documents in a new way</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.510" end="00:15:29.050" style="s2">we&#39;re looking at each other&#39;s faces in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.130" end="00:15:32.380" style="s2">new way so it&#39;s a it&#39;s a two-way street</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.050" end="00:15:34.209" style="s2">and I think it goes both ways the other</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.380" end="00:15:35.920" style="s2">thing just briefly to Kiera&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.209" end="00:15:38.889" style="s2">when you said that art is a great way to</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.920" end="00:15:41.649" style="s2">connect and suffering also is in</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.889" end="00:15:44.499" style="s2">building this community of artists what</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.649" end="00:15:46.600" style="s2">I found was the does if if I was to</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.499" end="00:15:49.470" style="s2">simplify two poles into those categories</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.600" end="00:15:51.999" style="s2">is that we had both in that community</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.470" end="00:15:54.399" style="s2">which is to say that we were a group of</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.999" end="00:15:57.639" style="s2">people that bonded around a shared love</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.399" end="00:15:59.410" style="s2">of art and the pursuit of technique and</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.639" end="00:16:02.110" style="s2">all of these things that are fun and</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.410" end="00:16:03.970" style="s2">exciting about art but if it was only</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.110" end="00:16:05.740" style="s2">that then it would devolve into a kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.970" end="00:16:07.660" style="s2">of an ego game and people would start to</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.740" end="00:16:10.240" style="s2">get wrapped up and trying to impress</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.660" end="00:16:12.069" style="s2">each other with their artworks and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.240" end="00:16:13.990" style="s2">what would then spontaneously come up</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.069" end="00:16:16.660" style="s2">would be more catharsis and more</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.990" end="00:16:18.610" style="s2">campfire discussion and people bringing</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.660" end="00:16:20.019" style="s2">up a lot of their fear around why am i</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.610" end="00:16:21.819" style="s2">an artist is this useful to the world</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.019" end="00:16:24.369" style="s2">what am I doing with my life kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.819" end="00:16:26.170" style="s2">stuff and that would sort of belt up you</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.369" end="00:16:29.350" style="s2">go but if it went all that way and there</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.170" end="00:16:31.269" style="s2">was nothing to to kind of congeal around</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.350" end="00:16:33.699" style="s2">then people wouldn&#39;t stick with the</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.269" end="00:16:35.559" style="s2">community after the events and so there</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.699" end="00:16:37.990" style="s2">was something about coming together</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.559" end="00:16:42.639" style="s2">around a shared love of something and</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.990" end="00:16:44.429" style="s2">also facilitating ways for people to</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.639" end="00:16:46.660" style="s2">open up their vulnerability and that</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.429" end="00:16:50.290" style="s2">community of a shared interest would</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.660" end="00:16:52.119" style="s2">sort of be a fallback and guarantee that</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.290" end="00:16:53.920" style="s2">that community would stick together even</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.119" end="00:16:56.170" style="s2">when people started showing all of their</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.920" end="00:16:57.670" style="s2">their and their shadows you know it</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.170" end="00:16:59.709" style="s2">was like well we can fall back on the</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.670" end="00:17:01.149" style="s2">fact that we both love drawing and we</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.709" end="00:17:03.939" style="s2">can talk about that for a while and</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.149" end="00:17:08.380" style="s2">bring the volume down so balancing those</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.939" end="00:17:10.569" style="s2">forces does powerfully so I should</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.380" end="00:17:12.329" style="s2">transition into now we get it created</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.569" end="00:17:14.649" style="s2">our beautiful world our world that is</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.329" end="00:17:16.390" style="s2">what community would look like for the</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.649" end="00:17:18.459" style="s2">planet or for ourselves that every want</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.390" end="00:17:19.750" style="s2">to focus on in however long in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.459" end="00:17:20.169" style="s2">future you need it to be afraid to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.750" end="00:17:22.390" style="s2">feasible</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.169" end="00:17:33.549" style="s2">five ten hundred years what does that</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.390" end="00:17:35.049" style="s2">look like to you um my young one I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.549" end="00:17:39.429" style="s2">had bumping around might had a lot for a</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.049" end="00:17:42.100" style="s2">while now is I really really really like</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.429" end="00:17:44.440" style="s2">the idea that pops around of the sub</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.100" end="00:17:47.750" style="s2">Dunbar number micro-communities</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.440" end="00:17:49.130" style="s2">like I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.750" end="00:17:51.110" style="s2">a little bit the Dunbar number things a</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.130" end="00:17:52.730" style="s2">little bit arbitrary is like I connect</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.110" end="00:17:54.950" style="s2">to it for its truthiness an intuitive</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.730" end="00:17:56.630" style="s2">connection like you know I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.950" end="00:17:58.790" style="s2">it&#39;s any kind of you know how well that</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.630" end="00:18:01.270" style="s2">original study holds up or anything but</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.790" end="00:18:04.370" style="s2">for a matter of personal aesthetic I</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.270" end="00:18:07.580" style="s2">like it regardless of whether the</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.370" end="00:18:10.220" style="s2">science adds up so much for that core</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.580" end="00:18:13.490" style="s2">idea of it being a unit of people where</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.220" end="00:18:17.930" style="s2">one can form close knowing connection</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.490" end="00:18:21.230" style="s2">yeah oh and I see those relating to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.930" end="00:18:24.320" style="s2">coronavirus stuff how like if we already</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.230" end="00:18:26.330" style="s2">had those tight communities we would be</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.320" end="00:18:28.520" style="s2">leaning on those right now especially</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.330" end="00:18:30.200" style="s2">like if they were like the physical ones</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.520" end="00:18:32.710" style="s2">organic farming out in the boonies or</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.200" end="00:18:35.090" style="s2">something but also the urban you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.710" end="00:18:37.910" style="s2">shared benefit corporation kind of idea</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.090" end="00:18:42.770" style="s2">as well we&#39;d be leaning on them for</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.910" end="00:18:44.540" style="s2">support and it would also be a way to</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.770" end="00:18:46.790" style="s2">set the wall up a little farther out</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.540" end="00:18:48.590" style="s2">than just the nuclear family you know to</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.790" end="00:18:50.060" style="s2">have something more than nuclear family</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.590" end="00:18:53.510" style="s2">but still having a semi permeable</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.060" end="00:18:55.880" style="s2">barrier to protect oneself from pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.510" end="00:18:57.710" style="s2">concerns and so on you know tuck away</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.880" end="00:18:59.360" style="s2">with 50 people maybe instead of five</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.710" end="00:19:02.810" style="s2">people would be a possibility and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.360" end="00:19:04.520" style="s2">kind of a setting yeah um where that</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.810" end="00:19:06.350" style="s2">micro community could kind of close its</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.520" end="00:19:08.570" style="s2">gates for awhile and pull into itself</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.350" end="00:19:10.280" style="s2">and you know live off its own food</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.570" end="00:19:15.290" style="s2">stores and things like that for a couple</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.280" end="00:19:17.360" style="s2">of months and still have something more</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.290" end="00:19:19.370" style="s2">of a vibrant human village community</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.360" end="00:19:23.870" style="s2">going on within itself and somewhere in</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.370" end="00:19:26.810" style="s2">that you know 15 to 150 people unit you</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.870" end="00:19:28.370" style="s2">know I imagine getting up to the higher</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.810" end="00:19:30.650" style="s2">end of that might be problematic on the</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.370" end="00:19:32.840" style="s2">pandemic scale but you know I think it&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.650" end="00:19:35.150" style="s2">be reasonable at 25 people could kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.840" end="00:19:36.470" style="s2">cloister together and if they were you</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.150" end="00:19:38.720" style="s2">know cutting off contact with the</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.470" end="00:19:42.700" style="s2">external world still have a reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.720" end="00:19:42.700" style="s2">effect on slowing down pandemic spread</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.030" end="00:19:47.000" style="s2">yeah I like these I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.560" end="00:19:48.680" style="s2">actually exactly the same thing just</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.000" end="00:19:50.750" style="s2">before you started talking Kevin I was</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.680" end="00:19:52.790" style="s2">thinking yeah yeah yeah that&#39;s that very</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.750" end="00:19:55.010" style="s2">very similar vision I have I would just</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.790" end="00:19:57.800" style="s2">take it one step further and say that</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.010" end="00:20:00.710" style="s2">those communities not only have strong</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.800" end="00:20:01.760" style="s2">social bonds between them but also rely</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.710" end="00:20:04.640" style="s2">on each other</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.760" end="00:20:07.160" style="s2">again my grand vision is that each of</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.640" end="00:20:10.610" style="s2">these communities would be so a very</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.160" end="00:20:13.450" style="s2">large extent self-sustaining right you</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.610" end="00:20:15.800" style="s2">know they would grow much of the most of</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.450" end="00:20:17.780" style="s2">their own deal with their own waste</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.800" end="00:20:19.580" style="s2">generate their own power you know all of</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.780" end="00:20:22.040" style="s2">this kind of stuff would be done within</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.580" end="00:20:24.290" style="s2">that community in this builds massive</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.040" end="00:20:27.110" style="s2">resilience into the society as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.290" end="00:20:29.300" style="s2">right because obviously communities can</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.110" end="00:20:30.860" style="s2">share with each other as well as each</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.300" end="00:20:32.360" style="s2">being independently you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.860" end="00:20:34.700" style="s2">self-sustaining they also have the</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.360" end="00:20:36.050" style="s2">opportunity to to share an exchange with</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.700" end="00:20:37.970" style="s2">each other and help each other out in</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.050" end="00:20:42.290" style="s2">hard times and all that kind of stuff so</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.970" end="00:20:45.580" style="s2">yeah that that builds a huge amount of</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.290" end="00:20:48.980" style="s2">redundancy and extra capacity and and</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.580" end="00:20:52.540" style="s2">slack if you like into in into the</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.980" end="00:20:54.800" style="s2">system to be updated to be taken up I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.540" end="00:20:57.290" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting as I was hearing you</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.800" end="00:20:59.870" style="s2">guys talk there&#39;s there&#39;s a part of me</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.290" end="00:21:05.230" style="s2">that really loves that idea and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.870" end="00:21:07.850" style="s2">also the reality of the lack of</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.230" end="00:21:10.070" style="s2">emotional resilience that most people</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.850" end="00:21:12.860" style="s2">have to live in that close of proximity</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.070" end="00:21:18.920" style="s2">with that many people it took my husband</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.860" end="00:21:23.060" style="s2">and I like six or seven years before we</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.920" end="00:21:25.880" style="s2">could like work through all of our stuff</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.060" end="00:21:30.260" style="s2">in terms of communicating with each</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.880" end="00:21:34.070" style="s2">other to be able to not want to kill</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.260" end="00:21:36.830" style="s2">each other at times and you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.070" end="00:21:39.920" style="s2">amount of you know that then I think my</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.830" end="00:21:45.190" style="s2">biggest concern is I don&#39;t know if I</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.920" end="00:21:48.680" style="s2">could count that many people that I know</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.190" end="00:21:56.770" style="s2">within Proximus is achill proximity of</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.680" end="00:22:00.830" style="s2">me that have the emotional intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.770" end="00:22:03.230" style="s2">to be able to like have the</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.830" end="00:22:06.470" style="s2">conversations of you know in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.230" end="00:22:08.030" style="s2">working through the emotional stuff you</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.470" end="00:22:10.550" style="s2">know I like at what Adam was talking</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.030" end="00:22:12.770" style="s2">about in terms of okay when when it gets</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.550" end="00:22:14.800" style="s2">to be too much in terms of you know the</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.770" end="00:22:18.460" style="s2">interpersonal stuff we can we</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.800" end="00:22:23.260" style="s2">divert to you know talking about art and</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.460" end="00:22:26.010" style="s2">I you know if if there was a situation</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.260" end="00:22:28.690" style="s2">where somebody had a homestead or</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.010" end="00:22:30.640" style="s2">acreage and stuff like that and like if</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.690" end="00:22:32.680" style="s2">you couldn&#39;t hit if if for a while it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.640" end="00:22:36.280" style="s2">like okay I can&#39;t talk to you right now</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.680" end="00:22:38.020" style="s2">let&#39;s go plant from corn like then there</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.280" end="00:22:41.110" style="s2">that there&#39;s something else to focus the</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.020" end="00:22:43.300" style="s2">energy on but there is I mean if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.110" end="00:22:45.700" style="s2">talking about if we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.300" end="00:22:47.230" style="s2">Jubilees idea of you know a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.700" end="00:22:51.910" style="s2">thousand dollars and ten thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.230" end="00:22:56.380" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if we could even buy one</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.910" end="00:22:56.800" style="s2">property for $100,000 so okay we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.380" end="00:22:58.630" style="s2">there yet</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.800" end="00:23:00.360" style="s2">River talking to about our ideal in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.630" end="00:23:02.650" style="s2">future oh and you know what does your</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.360" end="00:23:04.570" style="s2">ideal in the future look like for you</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.650" end="00:23:06.880" style="s2">for community kara okay what what does</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.570" end="00:23:11.350" style="s2">my ideal look like for me in the future</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.880" end="00:23:17.200" style="s2">that&#39;s um so I was skipping ahead a step</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.350" end="00:23:24.960" style="s2">sorry that&#39;s for me it&#39;s I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.200" end="00:23:24.960" style="s2">something similar along those lines i I</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.050" end="00:23:30.580" style="s2">think for me technology plays more of a</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.390" end="00:23:38.160" style="s2">role in it and I don&#39;t know quite what</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.580" end="00:23:44.740" style="s2">that how that plays into it um and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.160" end="00:23:46.210" style="s2">my ideal I think it you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.740" end="00:23:47.710" style="s2">definitely something about communal</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.210" end="00:23:50.080" style="s2">living there is definitely something</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.710" end="00:23:52.110" style="s2">about being more in touch with nature</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.080" end="00:23:56.830" style="s2">but there&#39;s also the inclusion of</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.110" end="00:23:59.680" style="s2">technology and you know looking at maybe</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.830" end="00:24:07.060" style="s2">looking at Quakers as a model I&#39;m I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.680" end="00:24:09.310" style="s2">not yeah that&#39;s one where I&#39;m having I I</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.060" end="00:24:11.740" style="s2">have a hard time committing to what it</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.310" end="00:24:13.360" style="s2">is that I the what my ideal is unless an</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.740" end="00:24:15.760" style="s2">interesting thing for me to observe so</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.360" end="00:24:17.410" style="s2">yeah I think that is also it having lots</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.760" end="00:24:18.730" style="s2">of for me it&#39;s still having a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.410" end="00:24:21.130" style="s2">possibility because I know there are</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.730" end="00:24:22.330" style="s2">things that I want to like I really want</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.130" end="00:24:23.860" style="s2">this and then I get it and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.330" end="00:24:26.140" style="s2">wait no no I actually don&#39;t want this</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.860" end="00:24:28.300" style="s2">and I think community especially is that</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.140" end="00:24:29.740" style="s2">for a lot of people they think</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.300" end="00:24:31.960" style="s2">they want intentional community and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.740" end="00:24:34.240" style="s2">they&#39;re in it and it&#39;s a lot of work</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.960" end="00:24:36.430" style="s2">it&#39;s a lot of emotional work and</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.240" end="00:24:38.290" style="s2">interrelated work that you don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.430" end="00:24:40.150" style="s2">you can&#39;t control other people and so</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.290" end="00:24:42.520" style="s2">what are you gonna what are you going to</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.150" end="00:24:43.870" style="s2">build a community around and having for</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.520" end="00:24:45.820" style="s2">me it&#39;s having diversity of communities</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.870" end="00:24:48.280" style="s2">so not just my community but I know I</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.820" end="00:24:51.190" style="s2">can always leave and therefore I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.280" end="00:24:53.320" style="s2">willing to stay and so also having a</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.190" end="00:24:55.360" style="s2">Dunbar community size that I would like</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.320" end="00:24:56.650" style="s2">to have is also focused on technical</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.360" end="00:24:58.630" style="s2">creating technology just because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.650" end="00:25:00.850" style="s2">what I&#39;m here to do but I know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.630" end="00:25:03.130" style="s2">pro and con towards having like a game</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.850" end="00:25:04.780" style="s2">be community then if you drop game B or</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.130" end="00:25:05.830" style="s2">you dropped for the community right or</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.780" end="00:25:09.820" style="s2">vice versa</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.830" end="00:25:12.460" style="s2">and but having an ace a place that I</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.820" end="00:25:13.360" style="s2">live and eat and play with so that when</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.460" end="00:25:14.860" style="s2">something like the Khurana buyers</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.360" end="00:25:16.210" style="s2">happens we can insulate when someone</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.860" end="00:25:18.970" style="s2">goes traveling it comes back we can</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.210" end="00:25:20.350" style="s2">quarantine them and at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.970" end="00:25:23.290" style="s2">being able to connect to people online</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.350" end="00:25:26.560" style="s2">and to have my special interests I can</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.290" end="00:25:28.990" style="s2">talk about or to connect over a very my</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.560" end="00:25:30.730" style="s2">new part that I might I might be into</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.990" end="00:25:33.280" style="s2">and so to be able to have these like</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.730" end="00:25:35.110" style="s2">what does it make what makes sense to me</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.280" end="00:25:36.820" style="s2">to live in community maybe I&#39;m a golf</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.110" end="00:25:39.100" style="s2">feeding person I&#39;m not but maybe</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.820" end="00:25:40.150" style="s2">and so I I love horses so I&#39;d love to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.100" end="00:25:41.560" style="s2">around horses even though I&#39;m not a</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.150" end="00:25:42.610" style="s2">Whore like I&#39;ve never had a horse I</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.560" end="00:25:44.860" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t know how to care for one by</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.610" end="00:25:46.210" style="s2">myself but having access to a horse I</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.860" end="00:25:47.980" style="s2">would love that and so I would look for</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.210" end="00:25:49.660" style="s2">a community that has that my daughter</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.980" end="00:25:51.190" style="s2">would probably love that too she want a</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.660" end="00:25:53.320" style="s2">dance studio so they look for that and</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.190" end="00:25:55.090" style="s2">then I would find people online to make</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.320" end="00:25:57.070" style="s2">technology with or it&#39;s been to do a</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.090" end="00:25:59.230" style="s2">project with and to be able to easily</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.070" end="00:26:01.270" style="s2">find any kind of community whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.230" end="00:26:02.770" style="s2">an artistic community at whatever level</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.270" end="00:26:05.110" style="s2">you&#39;re at whether it&#39;s a sporting</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.770" end="00:26:06.970" style="s2">community and being able to coordinate</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.110" end="00:26:09.880" style="s2">my life so I can have these interactions</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.970" end="00:26:11.770" style="s2">but also I personally want a small</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.880" end="00:26:14.320" style="s2">insulated group of people just because</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.770" end="00:26:16.570" style="s2">that&#39;s how I want to build relationships</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.320" end="00:26:17.950" style="s2">I want more deeper relationships with a</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.570" end="00:26:20.260" style="s2">few people rather than a surface level</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.950" end="00:26:23.260" style="s2">with a bunch of people and I want them</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.260" end="00:26:25.090" style="s2">in person and I want them online sorry</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.260" end="00:26:26.890" style="s2">that reminds me of something Kyra was</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.090" end="00:26:29.800" style="s2">saying before about being able to bring</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.890" end="00:26:32.290" style="s2">everything you are to your community and</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.800" end="00:26:34.060" style="s2">it got it just made me think it in in</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.290" end="00:26:35.590" style="s2">the time this is what you&#39;ve said just</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.060" end="00:26:37.900" style="s2">reminds me made me think in the moment</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.590" end="00:26:39.700" style="s2">that I guess it depends on what you mean</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.900" end="00:26:41.789" style="s2">by community by community do you mean</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.700" end="00:26:43.950" style="s2">like the one community in</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.789" end="00:26:46.379" style="s2">which you live in geographically because</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.950" end="00:26:48.389" style="s2">really we are members of multiple</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.379" end="00:26:49.919" style="s2">communities right and so you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.389" end="00:26:52.379" style="s2">necessarily need to bring everything you</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.919" end="00:26:54.899" style="s2">are to all of them right the some of</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.379" end="00:26:59.159" style="s2">them gives you what you need and you</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.899" end="00:27:00.960" style="s2">know that you see what I mean that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.159" end="00:27:03.149" style="s2">have to rely on one for everything is</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.960" end="00:27:12.450" style="s2">the point and equally it doesn&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.149" end="00:27:14.789" style="s2">expect everything of you do it now go</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.450" end="00:27:17.960" style="s2">for it you know I was just thinking that</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.789" end="00:27:20.340" style="s2">we quite often find ourselves in</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.960" end="00:27:23.369" style="s2">physical proximity communities</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.340" end="00:27:25.559" style="s2">involuntarily so you know we moved into</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.369" end="00:27:26.820" style="s2">an apartment building and suddenly we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.559" end="00:27:29.489" style="s2">in a building with a bunch of people</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.820" end="00:27:31.229" style="s2">that we we have no idea who they are we</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.489" end="00:27:33.419" style="s2">didn&#39;t choose them there was no there</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.229" end="00:27:35.909" style="s2">was no social contract there at all or</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.419" end="00:27:38.340" style="s2">as an artist many times I&#39;ve moved into</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.909" end="00:27:39.960" style="s2">big shared studios again you know I</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.340" end="00:27:41.549" style="s2">found a space that was the right price I</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.960" end="00:27:45.119" style="s2">have no idea who else is in there</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.549" end="00:27:46.799" style="s2">and where I spend all of my time doing</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.119" end="00:27:48.509" style="s2">the thing that I&#39;m passionate about I</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.799" end="00:27:51.899" style="s2">may or may not want to be around those</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.509" end="00:27:54.989" style="s2">people artistically speaking so I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.899" end="00:27:57.869" style="s2">that what the online world has given us</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.989" end="00:28:00.379" style="s2">is this gigantic selection of people</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.869" end="00:28:04.139" style="s2">from which we can compose our own</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.379" end="00:28:06.690" style="s2">entirely voluntary interactive group and</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.139" end="00:28:08.460" style="s2">then we&#39;re still in this messy offline</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.690" end="00:28:11.119" style="s2">world where we have to deal with all of</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.460" end="00:28:13.950" style="s2">these people that we have no Sara Lee</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.119" end="00:28:17.190" style="s2">like-minded relationship with so I can</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.950" end="00:28:19.440" style="s2">see an ideal future where I can split my</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.190" end="00:28:21.509" style="s2">world into two downbar groups there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.440" end="00:28:23.489" style="s2">Dunbar group that I choose based on</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.509" end="00:28:25.590" style="s2">wanting to live with them but having a</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.489" end="00:28:27.869" style="s2">wide variety of personality types and</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.590" end="00:28:29.639" style="s2">interests and there&#39;s my online Dunbar</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.869" end="00:28:32.070" style="s2">group which may also be from a wide</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.639" end="00:28:33.509" style="s2">variety of interests but it&#39;s connected</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.070" end="00:28:37.320" style="s2">around the things that are important to</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.509" end="00:28:41.309" style="s2">me and that online my my individual</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.320" end="00:28:44.489" style="s2">online Dunbar 100 or 150 does not have</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.309" end="00:28:46.320" style="s2">to be shared between that 150 people I</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.489" end="00:28:48.720" style="s2">can be one of a completely different</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.320" end="00:28:50.399" style="s2">Dunbar group for that individual which</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.720" end="00:28:52.259" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work if you&#39;re creating a</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.399" end="00:28:53.789" style="s2">physical community and so I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.259" end="00:28:55.500" style="s2">there&#39;s two different structures that</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.789" end="00:28:58.590" style="s2">you&#39;re building there one is how do I</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.500" end="00:29:00.750" style="s2">limit this massive online selection to a</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.590" end="00:29:02.790" style="s2">group that&#39;s that&#39;s really in line with</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.750" end="00:29:05.310" style="s2">what I&#39;m trying to do and then how do I</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.790" end="00:29:06.990" style="s2">expand myself offline to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.310" end="00:29:09.750" style="s2">interact with very different individuals</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.990" end="00:29:14.010" style="s2">in a local community two different</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.750" end="00:29:17.160" style="s2">challenges I like that I think it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.010" end="00:29:19.770" style="s2">important to in that it adds a extra</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.160" end="00:29:22.080" style="s2">layer of anti fragility the online</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.770" end="00:29:24.150" style="s2">network helps build some kind of meta</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.080" end="00:29:26.400" style="s2">layer of connections like when you have</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.150" end="00:29:29.280" style="s2">fibers biased in different directions to</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.400" end="00:29:30.480" style="s2">form a stronger you know like they do</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.280" end="00:29:31.530" style="s2">with that building plywood where they</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.480" end="00:29:33.150" style="s2">put the different grain of the wood</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.530" end="00:29:35.280" style="s2">alternating directions because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.150" end="00:29:37.560" style="s2">stronger overall that way you get some</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.280" end="00:29:41.300" style="s2">kind of a layered you know different</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.560" end="00:29:43.920" style="s2">biases interconnecting and so it takes</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.300" end="00:29:45.660" style="s2">it helps absorb one can help absorb</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.920" end="00:29:48.270" style="s2">stresses from the other and distribute</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.660" end="00:29:50.700" style="s2">them and it makes the whole network more</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.270" end="00:29:55.410" style="s2">anti fragile overall and all larger</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.700" end="00:29:57.990" style="s2">community of community since I think UTS</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.410" end="00:30:00.240" style="s2">is having them not be so insular that</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.990" end="00:30:02.010" style="s2">people aren&#39;t connecting outside I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.240" end="00:30:04.590" style="s2">people have to connect outside those</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.010" end="00:30:06.150" style="s2">insular communities to some extent just</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.590" end="00:30:07.920" style="s2">for the survival of those insular</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.150" end="00:30:10.170" style="s2">communities and of humanity as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.920" end="00:30:12.150" style="s2">you know it can&#39;t be just disappear and</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.170" end="00:30:14.430" style="s2">pretend the world doesn&#39;t exist right I</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.150" end="00:30:16.650" style="s2">would not want to be living in a group</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.430" end="00:30:18.690" style="s2">of 150 people with one doctor unless</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.650" end="00:30:20.040" style="s2">that one doctor was connected to another</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.690" end="00:30:24.210" style="s2">hundred and fifty doctors who could</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.040" end="00:30:26.340" style="s2">share some ideas hmm yeah absolutely and</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.210" end="00:30:27.720" style="s2">having that one physical location you</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.340" end="00:30:30.270" style="s2">can do things like insulate yourself</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.720" end="00:30:32.010" style="s2">from a pandemic or just any you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.270" end="00:30:34.140" style="s2">even the flu be like no when you come</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.010" end="00:30:35.580" style="s2">back you are in a house for a week can</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.140" end="00:30:36.990" style="s2">you take care of you and that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.580" end="00:30:38.580" style="s2">if you decide to travel you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.990" end="00:30:40.650" style="s2">this and then some communities might be</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.580" end="00:30:42.060" style="s2">no all the international people live</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.650" end="00:30:43.140" style="s2">here and we&#39;re jet setters and we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.060" end="00:30:45.450" style="s2">over the place</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.140" end="00:30:47.550" style="s2">where the disease vectors for the world</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.450" end="00:30:49.170" style="s2">but at least they&#39;re not because right</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.550" end="00:30:50.760" style="s2">now our complexity our</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.170" end="00:30:52.680" style="s2">interconnectedness that we don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.760" end="00:30:55.770" style="s2">understand is showcasing all of our</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.680" end="00:30:57.330" style="s2">fragility and all of our that like even</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.770" end="00:30:58.620" style="s2">my community that is absolutely amazing</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.330" end="00:31:01.590" style="s2">they&#39;re the ones who&#39;ve taken the most</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.620" end="00:31:03.330" style="s2">steps forward they cancel their common</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.590" end="00:31:04.679" style="s2">meals for a month they&#39;re having an</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.330" end="00:31:06.240" style="s2">online meeting this Thursday to discuss</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.679" end="00:31:08.240" style="s2">it even though they&#39;re five feet away</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.240" end="00:31:09.440" style="s2">from each other right there and</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.240" end="00:31:11.179" style="s2">talking about counsel in the playroom</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.440" end="00:31:13.100" style="s2">they&#39;re looking after each other they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.179" end="00:31:15.800" style="s2">able to have that capacity to do that</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.100" end="00:31:17.090" style="s2">but there&#39;s four nurses who live there</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.800" end="00:31:18.530" style="s2">there&#39;s you know I mean everyone&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.090" end="00:31:20.960" style="s2">leaving and going to their work the kids</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.530" end="00:31:21.920" style="s2">are still if they&#39;re on spring break but</p>

<p begin="00:31:21.920" end="00:31:28.640" style="s2">and so having an enslaved community that</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.380" end="00:31:30.679" style="s2">you play with eat with learn with and</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.640" end="00:31:32.780" style="s2">then having outside connected</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.679" end="00:31:34.100" style="s2">communities that are hey I have my</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.780" end="00:31:35.870" style="s2">special interests here you go and play</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.100" end="00:31:37.190" style="s2">sports and stuff but you&#39;re also you can</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.870" end="00:31:39.860" style="s2">pull it back and if there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.190" end="00:31:42.890" style="s2">going around and I I went over to the 30</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.860" end="00:31:46.220" style="s2">minutes I&#39;m sure that I like this having</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.890" end="00:31:48.260" style="s2">a place to retreat to being yeah and so</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.220" end="00:31:49.790" style="s2">now we can move on to the adjacent</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.260" end="00:31:52.179" style="s2">possible which we give the majority of</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.790" end="00:31:55.910" style="s2">the time to so what could we actually do</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.179" end="00:32:00.290" style="s2">right now in the world if we had 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.910" end="00:32:02.510" style="s2">people and $100,000 we are we talking</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.290" end="00:32:04.160" style="s2">about we have 10,000 people to work on a</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.510" end="00:32:07.250" style="s2">project or we&#39;re doing something with</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.160" end="00:32:08.210" style="s2">those 10,000 people so 10,000 people</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.250" end="00:32:10.670" style="s2">work here a project we&#39;re pretty</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.210" end="00:32:12.530" style="s2">difficult but it&#39;s it&#39;s solving it for</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.670" end="00:32:14.870" style="s2">those 10,000 people so 10,000 members</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.530" end="00:32:17.330" style="s2">10,000 customers 10,000 people that are</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.870" end="00:32:18.950" style="s2">involved at some level in funding it</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.330" end="00:32:20.750" style="s2">that&#39;s where the hundred thousand 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.950" end="00:32:22.340" style="s2">is for 10,000 people to put in ten</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.750" end="00:32:24.350" style="s2">dollars it&#39;s not gonna break the bank</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.340" end="00:32:25.700" style="s2">but they&#39;re probably not going to do the</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.350" end="00:32:28.010" style="s2">work they&#39;re not gonna want to do the</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.700" end="00:32:30.830" style="s2">work it&#39;ll be maybe a 10,000 putting in</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.010" end="00:32:32.990" style="s2">money a hunt and having conversations</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.830" end="00:32:35.690" style="s2">and doing surface level work 100 doing</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.990" end="00:32:38.840" style="s2">actual work and maybe 10 doing full-time</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.690" end="00:32:40.929" style="s2">paid work yeah I mean based on that kind</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.840" end="00:32:43.370" style="s2">of model I think I think you could</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.929" end="00:32:45.920" style="s2">something that seems an experimentation</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.370" end="00:32:48.679" style="s2">is always is always key to my thinking</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.920" end="00:32:50.000" style="s2">right and with $100,000 we tend to I</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.679" end="00:32:51.440" style="s2">mean not all 10,000 people could</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.000" end="00:32:52.910" style="s2">actually participate in the experiment</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.440" end="00:32:54.200" style="s2">right but they could fund it and they</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.910" end="00:32:58.550" style="s2">could observe it they could comment on</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.200" end="00:33:01.780" style="s2">it and suggest and and and so on but you</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.550" end="00:33:03.860" style="s2">you could you could define a set of</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.780" end="00:33:06.559" style="s2">parameters characteristics goals</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.860" end="00:33:08.120" style="s2">whatever it might be and and that is</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.559" end="00:33:10.670" style="s2">what you build a community around I</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.120" end="00:33:12.290" style="s2">think that notion of being able to step</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.670" end="00:33:14.059" style="s2">away from the interpersonal stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.290" end="00:33:15.800" style="s2">just have to get on with right and</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.059" end="00:33:17.179" style="s2">come back to that later when you&#39;ve all</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.800" end="00:33:19.330" style="s2">had time to off-gas I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.179" end="00:33:22.130" style="s2">really really important so having a</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.330" end="00:33:24.200" style="s2">thing whatever it is be it</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.130" end="00:33:25.550" style="s2">upbeat music permaculture it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.200" end="00:33:29.780" style="s2">matter whatever is a bit but have a</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.550" end="00:33:31.990" style="s2">clear thing you know that it&#39;s built</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.780" end="00:33:36.170" style="s2">around and then you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.990" end="00:33:38.840" style="s2">strategies are all aligned to that</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.170" end="00:33:40.370" style="s2">central mission if you like and and</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.840" end="00:33:43.040" style="s2">experiment with it and see what works</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.370" end="00:33:44.570" style="s2">and what doesn&#39;t and $100,000 I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.040" end="00:33:47.120" style="s2">allows you to run that experiment with</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.570" end="00:33:48.890" style="s2">say 50 people write something like that</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.120" end="00:33:51.350" style="s2">50 people 20 households something in</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.890" end="00:33:53.330" style="s2">something on that kind of scale and and</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.350" end="00:33:56.420" style="s2">and just see what you can do just see</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.330" end="00:33:57.770" style="s2">what you can do I didn&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.420" end="00:34:01.070" style="s2">understand that what are the 50 people</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.770" end="00:34:01.580" style="s2">doing living living together in a</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.070" end="00:34:08.120" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.580" end="00:34:09.889" style="s2">ah I was giving some thought to this</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.120" end="00:34:12.919" style="s2">came up in conversation with a friend</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.889" end="00:34:15.879" style="s2">relational in a way on how I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.919" end="00:34:18.909" style="s2">envisioned possible like doing a</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.879" end="00:34:21.770" style="s2">transition be oriented community as a</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.909" end="00:34:23.659" style="s2">research project you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.770" end="00:34:26.960" style="s2">literally have the people that are in it</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.659" end="00:34:28.879" style="s2">commit to like Big Brother journaling</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.960" end="00:34:30.590" style="s2">and and even things like we&#39;re gonna try</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.879" end="00:34:31.669" style="s2">this decision-making method for six</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.590" end="00:34:33.409" style="s2">months then we&#39;re gonna try a different</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.669" end="00:34:36.580" style="s2">decision-making method and compare and</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.409" end="00:34:38.780" style="s2">contrast and you could I even I think</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.580" end="00:34:40.159" style="s2">incorporate it there might be advantages</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.780" end="00:34:42.590" style="s2">to even officially having an academic</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.159" end="00:34:44.540" style="s2">somebody that studies people systems</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.590" end="00:34:46.399" style="s2">whether it be Dave Snowden or but either</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.540" end="00:34:48.080" style="s2">ROI or whoever you know have somebody</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.399" end="00:34:52.879" style="s2">that&#39;s already like God academic</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.080" end="00:34:55.220" style="s2">standing even writing it up you know and</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.879" end="00:34:57.470" style="s2">framing it and getting academic grants</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.220" end="00:34:59.930" style="s2">and stuff for it bring in as well as the</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.470" end="00:35:01.040" style="s2">ten dollars per 10,000 people also see</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.930" end="00:35:03.640" style="s2">if you can just pull in some straight-up</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.040" end="00:35:08.960" style="s2">you know grant funding money for it and</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.640" end="00:35:12.410" style="s2">and put somewhere in the 15 to 50 or</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.960" end="00:35:16.760" style="s2">whatever people in some kind of coaling</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.410" end="00:35:19.370" style="s2">situation and yeah and then record it</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.760" end="00:35:21.470" style="s2">and learn from their iterations can I</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.370" end="00:35:23.540" style="s2">ask out of the five people over here cuz</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.470" end="00:35:26.690" style="s2">Stacy&#39;s on mute cell is um</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.540" end="00:35:28.580" style="s2">weather would you be one of the non</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.690" end="00:35:31.670" style="s2">fifty would you want to fund other</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.580" end="00:35:33.170" style="s2">people to live in the fifty like which</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.670" end="00:35:35.040" style="s2">side of that do you want to be on how do</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.170" end="00:35:37.980" style="s2">you envision yourself participating</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.040" end="00:35:39.270" style="s2">if we win 10 bucks then yes and just</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.980" end="00:35:41.100" style="s2">because I&#39;m not one of the 50 does not</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.270" end="00:35:43.860" style="s2">mean I&#39;m not participating right I am</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.100" end="00:35:46.500" style="s2">I&#39;m involved in the experiment you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.860" end="00:35:48.350" style="s2">I&#39;m a curious interested party who will</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.500" end="00:35:52.020" style="s2">offer my comments observations</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.350" end="00:35:53.490" style="s2">suggestions criticisms etc of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.020" end="00:35:55.050" style="s2">going on along with everybody else I</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.490" end="00:35:56.100" style="s2">mean that&#39;s part of being the 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.050" end="00:35:58.500" style="s2">right is you&#39;re involved in this</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.100" end="00:36:00.030" style="s2">experiment even though you may not be</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.500" end="00:36:03.630" style="s2">one of the 50 that&#39;s actually living it</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.030" end="00:36:05.460" style="s2">up with that I would say I would not</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.630" end="00:36:11.000" style="s2">want to be one of the fifty because I</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.460" end="00:36:11.000" style="s2">would not want to have 950 other people</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.420" end="00:36:18.600" style="s2">the other people being able to have an</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.390" end="00:36:21.870" style="s2">input on how the 50 people live their</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.600" end="00:36:23.220" style="s2">lives like it would be inviting to nine</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.870" end="00:36:25.620" style="s2">hundred and fifty nine thousand nine</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.220" end="00:36:28.830" style="s2">hundred fifty people they would be</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.620" end="00:36:33.990" style="s2">contributing $10 and the the 50 people</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.830" end="00:36:36.270" style="s2">would would be you give like I would I</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.990" end="00:36:38.610" style="s2">would only want to participate if that</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.270" end="00:36:40.440" style="s2">meant that the 50 people were autonomous</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.610" end="00:36:44.700" style="s2">and other people were not giving their</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.440" end="00:36:46.400" style="s2">input on that other people were more a</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.700" end="00:36:48.270" style="s2">YouTube channel where they passively</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.400" end="00:36:50.400" style="s2">kick in but they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.270" end="00:37:02.670" style="s2">decision-making power but they can still</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.400" end="00:37:05.070" style="s2">offer suggestions but then but then the</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.670" end="00:37:07.110" style="s2">thing that comes to mind is like this or</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.070" end="00:37:14.990" style="s2">what came to mind add from that</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.110" end="00:37:14.990" style="s2">description was hello MTV the TV show</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.290" end="00:37:23.660" style="s2">like I agreed to send into that I agree</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.330" end="00:37:26.430" style="s2">that is a dangerous Adam looks like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.660" end="00:37:27.960" style="s2">something so what if you were to split</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.430" end="00:37:30.420" style="s2">out those parts of the process and you</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.960" end="00:37:33.360" style="s2">said okay we need our privacy and our</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.420" end="00:37:39.060" style="s2">autonomy to live this experiment out but</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.360" end="00:37:42.180" style="s2">we need 9950 backers at $10 h and your</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.060" end="00:37:47.100" style="s2">buy-in is $10 and along with that you</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.180" end="00:37:48.720" style="s2">make some brief succinct recommendations</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.100" end="00:37:51.780" style="s2">for how you think this experiment should</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.720" end="00:37:54.780" style="s2">run we collect all of that aggregate</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.780" end="00:37:57.000" style="s2">that data formulate the experiment</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.780" end="00:37:58.410" style="s2">through that with in agreement with the</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.000" end="00:38:02.340" style="s2">50 people that say yes we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.410" end="00:38:04.230" style="s2">comfortable to try this right and then</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.340" end="00:38:07.260" style="s2">and then what you get back at the end is</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.230" end="00:38:08.790" style="s2">proper well-documented research okay we</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.260" end="00:38:10.680" style="s2">ran the experiment this is how the</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.790" end="00:38:12.720" style="s2">community worked who are the problems we</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.680" end="00:38:15.410" style="s2">encountered and that information is</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.720" end="00:38:17.610" style="s2">given back as your reward for</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.410" end="00:38:19.620" style="s2">kick-starting this experiment and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.610" end="00:38:21.900" style="s2">even quarterly updates or something you</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.620" end="00:38:24.630" style="s2">know like some I think updates would be</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.900" end="00:38:26.130" style="s2">yeah I was feeling like atom two is like</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.630" end="00:38:30.270" style="s2">I was thinking along those lines a bit</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.130" end="00:38:31.710" style="s2">too is having the initial stage not have</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.270" end="00:38:33.930" style="s2">the two concurrent have the first</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.710" end="00:38:36.150" style="s2">bringing people in and then committing</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.930" end="00:38:37.710" style="s2">to because oh also part of it that the</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.150" end="00:38:39.630" style="s2">attend thousand could take part in would</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.710" end="00:38:42.570" style="s2">be like you know finding site location</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.630" end="00:38:43.770" style="s2">and helping research zoning and you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.570" end="00:38:45.780" style="s2">like I&#39;d like to try building a</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.770" end="00:38:47.640" style="s2">compressed earth house you know but</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.780" end="00:38:48.240" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna be finding a county where</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.640" end="00:38:51.930" style="s2">the zonings</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.240" end="00:38:54.600" style="s2">you know see this is to me I think</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.930" end="00:38:56.280" style="s2">actually that level is actually what we</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.600" end="00:38:57.420" style="s2">would want to do with ten thousand</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.280" end="00:38:58.890" style="s2">people at a hundred thousand dollars</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.420" end="00:39:00.030" style="s2">because I wouldn&#39;t want to find other</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.890" end="00:39:01.320" style="s2">people like I want to live in that</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.030" end="00:39:04.530" style="s2">community and I want to be part of that</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.320" end="00:39:05.820" style="s2">first of all there&#39;s hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.530" end="00:39:07.380" style="s2">intentional communities around the world</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.820" end="00:39:09.450" style="s2">right now and there&#39;s thousands that</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.380" end="00:39:11.040" style="s2">have been tried and failed and so</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.450" end="00:39:12.750" style="s2">getting those people together to have a</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.040" end="00:39:14.610" style="s2">conversation and the experiments already</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.750" end="00:39:16.560" style="s2">been run so asking what worked what</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.610" end="00:39:17.670" style="s2">didn&#39;t work what decision-making policy</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.560" end="00:39:19.110" style="s2">and all of that seems like more</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.670" end="00:39:21.330" style="s2">effective than watching this community</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.110" end="00:39:23.070" style="s2">fall apart and do its own thing for</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.330" end="00:39:25.500" style="s2">however long it&#39;s it&#39;s able to do that</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.070" end="00:39:26.790" style="s2">but having if we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.500" end="00:39:29.730" style="s2">concentrating almost physical</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.790" end="00:39:32.970" style="s2">communities having a resource to be able</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.730" end="00:39:34.620" style="s2">to say hey I how do we find a group of</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.970" end="00:39:35.850" style="s2">how do we find our 50 people we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.620" end="00:39:38.250" style="s2">have to put in way more than ten dollars</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.850" end="00:39:41.070" style="s2">to form our community right you have to</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.250" end="00:39:43.260" style="s2">put in $10,000 or $100,000 or how do we</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.070" end="00:39:44.340" style="s2">fund it but how do I find people to</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.260" end="00:39:46.080" style="s2">create a community with what are we</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.340" end="00:39:48.450" style="s2">creating it around how do we decide on</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.080" end="00:39:49.740" style="s2">what kind of shelter to create what how</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.450" end="00:39:51.720" style="s2">do we decide on plumbing and how do we</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.740" end="00:39:53.420" style="s2">decide on what is out there right now</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.720" end="00:39:56.010" style="s2">and what&#39;s best how does OE work in my</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.420" end="00:39:58.230" style="s2">province versus your state right like</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.010" end="00:40:00.990" style="s2">how do we actually create the</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.230" end="00:40:02.700" style="s2">information sharing and resources the</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.990" end="00:40:05.760" style="s2">infrastructure to find and create</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.700" end="00:40:08.670" style="s2">in me Eric there&#39;s another way we could</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.760" end="00:40:10.320" style="s2">utilize the tenth L the 10,000 people in</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.670" end="00:40:12.030" style="s2">this group as well Kevin said something</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.320" end="00:40:13.470" style="s2">which made me think this that you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.030" end="00:40:15.930" style="s2">in that group of ten thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.470" end="00:40:17.340" style="s2">will be all kinds of people with</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.930" end="00:40:19.740" style="s2">expertise in all kinds of things right</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.340" end="00:40:21.210" style="s2">how to make automatic composting toilets</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.740" end="00:40:22.980" style="s2">and and and and and turn that into</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.210" end="00:40:24.810" style="s2">fertilizer and how to purify your water</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.980" end="00:40:27.330" style="s2">and how to heat your blah blah blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.810" end="00:40:31.080" style="s2">blah blah blah right and so these people</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.330" end="00:40:33.060" style="s2">could a contribute technology and ideas</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.080" end="00:40:34.500" style="s2">for technology and actual stuff in</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.060" end="00:40:35.850" style="s2">addition to their ten dollars and</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.500" end="00:40:37.500" style="s2">remember it&#39;s not every single person</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.850" end="00:40:39.630" style="s2">paying exactly ten dollars right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.500" end="00:40:41.400" style="s2">you invite contributions and some people</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.630" end="00:40:43.620" style="s2">contribute more than others and in this</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.400" end="00:40:44.640" style="s2">sphere also some people will contribute</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.620" end="00:40:46.290" style="s2">more than others some people will</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.640" end="00:40:48.060" style="s2">actually give you stuff which you can</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.290" end="00:40:49.920" style="s2">use in the community you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.060" end="00:40:51.450" style="s2">mean with it and so you know the hundred</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.920" end="00:40:52.860" style="s2">thousand dollar startup cash you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.450" end="00:40:55.950" style="s2">would be something that supplement to a</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.860" end="00:40:57.840" style="s2">very large extent by stuff that people</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.950" end="00:41:03.120" style="s2">will give you to crack on and use and</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.840" end="00:41:04.980" style="s2">experiment with how it goes right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.120" end="00:41:06.680" style="s2">not just the engineering of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.980" end="00:41:09.240" style="s2">community as a whole there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.680" end="00:41:11.730" style="s2">hundreds and hundreds of sub experiments</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.240" end="00:41:14.580" style="s2">in you know the actualities of living</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.730" end="00:41:16.590" style="s2">you know the engine the physics and</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.580" end="00:41:18.630" style="s2">engineering of living which need to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.590" end="00:41:19.710" style="s2">undertaken as well right techniques</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.630" end="00:41:23.370" style="s2">which need to be refined and improved</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.710" end="00:41:26.640" style="s2">and blah blah blah so yeah III still</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.370" end="00:41:28.320" style="s2">don&#39;t know I completely agree with you</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.640" end="00:41:29.700" style="s2">that there&#39;s going to be clamoring to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.320" end="00:41:31.680" style="s2">one of the 50 there&#39;s gonna be way more</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.700" end="00:41:33.630" style="s2">than 50 who want to be one of the fifty</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.680" end="00:41:35.130" style="s2">I I completely agree with that and some</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.630" end="00:41:36.330" style="s2">kind of selection process and some</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.130" end="00:41:38.310" style="s2">people are going to resent the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.330" end="00:41:40.110" style="s2">they didn&#39;t get selected and all of that</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.310" end="00:41:42.030" style="s2">I agree is a problem with this I I</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.110" end="00:41:44.160" style="s2">accept all of that but nevertheless I</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.030" end="00:41:45.870" style="s2">still think that community of 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.160" end="00:41:47.790" style="s2">would have a really significant</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.870" end="00:41:49.110" style="s2">contribution to make in an ongoing way</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.790" end="00:41:50.490" style="s2">right because one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.110" end="00:41:52.440" style="s2">might come out of the community is our</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.490" end="00:41:53.970" style="s2">plumbing system doesn&#39;t work right for</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.440" end="00:41:55.410" style="s2">whatever reason because of this terrain</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.970" end="00:41:56.910" style="s2">blah blah blah we&#39;ve run across this</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.410" end="00:42:02.760" style="s2">problem you put that out to the</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.910" end="00:42:05.100" style="s2">community and you got nice nice yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.760" end="00:42:06.450" style="s2">when the community when the test</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.100" end="00:42:08.940" style="s2">community has problems they can</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.450" end="00:42:11.730" style="s2">crowdsource to the PS large code</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.940" end="00:42:13.650" style="s2">interest sauce I want to hang on away</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.730" end="00:42:15.269" style="s2">possibly to avoid that selection process</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.650" end="00:42:17.579" style="s2">uncomfortable this</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.269" end="00:42:19.890" style="s2">ah one way to avoid that selection</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.579" end="00:42:22.169" style="s2">process uncomfortableness might be for</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.890" end="00:42:24.929" style="s2">the 50 to come together in the first</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.169" end="00:42:27.809" style="s2">place and then present the project right</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.929" end="00:42:29.789" style="s2">from the very beginning as we this 50</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.809" end="00:42:31.229" style="s2">are asking for patrons that are</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.789" end="00:42:33.390" style="s2">interested in this experiment we would</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.229" end="00:42:35.819" style="s2">like to hold and then it&#39;s already done</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.390" end="00:42:38.999" style="s2">and there&#39;s no fighting for a slot you</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.819" end="00:42:40.769" style="s2">know one the same sense of ownership</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.999" end="00:42:42.839" style="s2">though sorry I don&#39;t even racing</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.769" end="00:42:43.559" style="s2">throughout I do apologize a problem at</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.839" end="00:42:46.799" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.559" end="00:42:47.880" style="s2">my my first thought because of just</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.799" end="00:42:50.069" style="s2">everything that&#39;s happening at the</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.880" end="00:42:52.799" style="s2">moment when this question came up my</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.069" end="00:42:55.349" style="s2">mind just jumps to technology to apps to</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.799" end="00:42:56.909" style="s2">this online communication thing where</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.349" end="00:43:00.539" style="s2">all of the innovations going and it</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.909" end="00:43:03.239" style="s2">jumps there because I think $100,000</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.539" end="00:43:05.459" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about physically setting</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.239" end="00:43:08.429" style="s2">up a community those numbers don&#39;t match</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.459" end="00:43:09.899" style="s2">to me so ok like like if we can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.429" end="00:43:12.059" style="s2">anything physical with a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.899" end="00:43:14.039" style="s2">thousand dollars what can we build with</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.059" end="00:43:17.640" style="s2">that that will then flow into something</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.039" end="00:43:20.429" style="s2">physical so in my mind I see 100</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.640" end="00:43:23.969" style="s2">thousand dollar build a platform for</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.429" end="00:43:26.339" style="s2">10,000 people a digital platform which</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.969" end="00:43:29.880" style="s2">is a dunbar of Dunbar&#39;s 100 groups of</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.339" end="00:43:32.339" style="s2">100 people each each of those 100 groups</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.880" end="00:43:34.859" style="s2">takes a problem that needs to be solved</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.339" end="00:43:39.359" style="s2">for a large sustainable network of</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.859" end="00:43:41.009" style="s2">communities so imagine 100 communities</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.359" end="00:43:43.529" style="s2">spread out among different countries</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.009" end="00:43:45.929" style="s2">with a hundred people each from mixed</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.529" end="00:43:48.599" style="s2">professions but it begins with 100</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.929" end="00:43:51.209" style="s2">groups of 100 people in each profession</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.599" end="00:43:54.239" style="s2">problem solving what what does it take</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.209" end="00:43:56.329" style="s2">to run these communities cooling all of</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.239" end="00:43:58.829" style="s2">those solutions so a solution for</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.329" end="00:44:00.959" style="s2">sanitation a solution to education</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.829" end="00:44:03.689" style="s2">learnt the food all of these groups</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.959" end="00:44:05.399" style="s2">focusing on that the results are all</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.689" end="00:44:08.099" style="s2">pulled together and then those</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.399" end="00:44:10.289" style="s2">communities of 100 can start to form</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.099" end="00:44:12.779" style="s2">geographically and begin their own</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.289" end="00:44:15.359" style="s2">funding mechanisms and say we now have</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.779" end="00:44:16.769" style="s2">not only a group of 100 people that are</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.359" end="00:44:19.139" style="s2">ready to come together and form a</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.769" end="00:44:21.689" style="s2">community but each one of those 100</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.139" end="00:44:23.249" style="s2">people give or take is connected to an</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.689" end="00:44:25.229" style="s2">active group of a hundred people around</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.249" end="00:44:27.389" style="s2">the world all focused on that part of</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.229" end="00:44:28.649" style="s2">community building and it&#39;s the platform</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.389" end="00:44:29.250" style="s2">that&#39;s the key here</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.649" end="00:44:31.320" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.250" end="00:44:33.540" style="s2">collect information which which holds</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.320" end="00:44:37.260" style="s2">the accountability which gives the proof</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.540" end="00:44:38.910" style="s2">of concept I love that atom I think that</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.260" end="00:44:43.560" style="s2">was I don&#39;t even want to change the</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.910" end="00:44:45.360" style="s2">topic now cuz I was shopping around an</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.560" end="00:44:47.610" style="s2">idea that is very similar to that for</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.360" end="00:44:50.160" style="s2">about well I but actively shopping the</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.610" end="00:44:52.140" style="s2">idea around for about six weeks the</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.160" end="00:44:55.890" style="s2">overall dream of it little goes back a</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.140" end="00:44:58.140" style="s2">little farther but I like the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.890" end="00:45:00.510" style="s2">incorporating something as a class-b</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.140" end="00:45:03.090" style="s2">benefit corporation or nonprofit and</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.510" end="00:45:08.000" style="s2">calling it the pet name I&#39;ve had for it</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.090" end="00:45:13.260" style="s2">is becoming be becoming be incorporated</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.000" end="00:45:15.720" style="s2">and the idea for that stirred around the</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.260" end="00:45:17.280" style="s2">software platform I think to start with</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.720" end="00:45:19.980" style="s2">would be to leverage something called</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.280" end="00:45:23.820" style="s2">MediaWiki which is the software which</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.980" end="00:45:25.410" style="s2">wikipedia uses you can do more than just</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.820" end="00:45:27.950" style="s2">an information with you with the</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.410" end="00:45:30.990" style="s2">software it has a fairly extensive</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.950" end="00:45:33.510" style="s2">social interaction element under the</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.990" end="00:45:35.940" style="s2">hood that the editors of Wikipedia used</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.510" end="00:45:37.740" style="s2">to interact with each other that could</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.940" end="00:45:40.230" style="s2">be brought more to the forefront and</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.740" end="00:45:42.540" style="s2">made a side-by-side thing with the</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.230" end="00:45:44.790" style="s2">information sharing in a way to where</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.540" end="00:45:46.800" style="s2">you can leverage both the hub to store</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.790" end="00:45:51.120" style="s2">information and also a hub to interact</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.800" end="00:45:53.000" style="s2">and form relationships one could have</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.120" end="00:45:55.440" style="s2">those</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.000" end="00:45:57.360" style="s2">what were you saying like 200 silos of</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.440" end="00:45:59.910" style="s2">100 or the different little subgroups</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.360" end="00:46:02.100" style="s2">one could do those of subdomains within</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.910" end="00:46:04.590" style="s2">a central wiki they could each then</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.100" end="00:46:06.120" style="s2">branch off and have their own separate</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.590" end="00:46:09.990" style="s2">server which is still linked to the</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.120" end="00:46:13.590" style="s2">course or server as things grow I had</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.990" end="00:46:15.210" style="s2">originally envisioned it as becoming</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.590" end="00:46:16.770" style="s2">more of a sort of a meaning hub in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.210" end="00:46:18.510" style="s2">first place but then I started thinking</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.770" end="00:46:20.400" style="s2">about the hands on people that actually</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.510" end="00:46:24.210" style="s2">are doing attempts at intentional</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.400" end="00:46:25.800" style="s2">community and are doing ecological like</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.210" end="00:46:27.930" style="s2">house building and da-da-da-da-da and</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.800" end="00:46:29.970" style="s2">how it would be nice to bring them in</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.930" end="00:46:33.360" style="s2">with the meaning space people as well</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.970" end="00:46:35.430" style="s2">where I was imagining this MediaWiki</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.360" end="00:46:37.110" style="s2">instance called meaning hub I&#39;ve now</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.430" end="00:46:39.960" style="s2">been thinking of calling it being hub</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.110" end="00:46:42.640" style="s2">and incorporate a wider variety of</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.960" end="00:46:44.499" style="s2">people into its original foundation</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.640" end="00:46:46.779" style="s2">with the understanding that as it grows</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.499" end="00:46:48.609" style="s2">it will branch out into people having</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.779" end="00:46:50.799" style="s2">their own freestanding semi-autonomous</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.609" end="00:46:52.869" style="s2">servers which still have a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.799" end="00:46:54.609" style="s2">with the central hub you know which to</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.869" end="00:46:56.829" style="s2">link to and share information and have a</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.609" end="00:46:59.789" style="s2">bit of elbow running and chats and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.829" end="00:47:02.739" style="s2">there and part of that was to facilitate</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.789" end="00:47:05.079" style="s2">people forming actual real world</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.739" end="00:47:08.140" style="s2">community as part of the idea of this as</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.079" end="00:47:10.539" style="s2">well as facilitating idea exchange my</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.140" end="00:47:11.319" style="s2">idea was if I get like game be having a</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.539" end="00:47:13.660" style="s2">sub-domain</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.319" end="00:47:16.630" style="s2">and also integral having a sub-domain</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.660" end="00:47:18.999" style="s2">and the portal having a sub-domain and</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.630" end="00:47:21.400" style="s2">meta modernism having a sub-domain and</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.999" end="00:47:23.650" style="s2">this group of people in like what the</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.400" end="00:47:25.989" style="s2">open source ecology project say having a</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.650" end="00:47:27.609" style="s2">subdomain yada yada yada if you get</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.989" end="00:47:29.680" style="s2">these starting from this central place</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.609" end="00:47:33.039" style="s2">and then you know diversifying a bit out</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.680" end="00:47:36.900" style="s2">from there it&#39;s going to help facilitate</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.039" end="00:47:40.900" style="s2">a higher percentage of relationships in</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.900" end="00:47:42.940" style="s2">physical reasonable proximity like I</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.900" end="00:47:44.499" style="s2">don&#39;t like like those ideas Kevin but</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.940" end="00:47:49.440" style="s2">also I want to concentrate on like not</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.499" end="00:47:49.440" style="s2">the technology sorry I&#39;ll get it done</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.869" end="00:48:04.749" style="s2">it&#39;s generating the dream of what 200</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.440" end="00:48:07.480" style="s2">bucks if anybody would like the original</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.749" end="00:48:09.190" style="s2">incarnation I&#39;m getting ready to do it</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.480" end="00:48:11.589" style="s2">on a computer in my house as an example</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.190" end="00:48:13.599" style="s2">but if I would love to skip that step</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.589" end="00:48:15.549" style="s2">and go straight to a shared cloud server</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.599" end="00:48:17.880" style="s2">if somebody wants to help crowd fund the</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.549" end="00:48:20.259" style="s2">200 bucks and make this happen</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.880" end="00:48:23.710" style="s2">Belva Kathy that&#39;s my challenge to</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.259" end="00:48:27.460" style="s2">everybody listing it like I love the</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.710" end="00:48:29.890" style="s2">tech solutions but I love the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.460" end="00:48:31.390" style="s2">the hundreds hundred because one you</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.890" end="00:48:33.400" style="s2">just need the first hundred to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.390" end="00:48:35.650" style="s2">talk about fighting the other hundred</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.400" end="00:48:37.839" style="s2">like everybody we each 500 people or how</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.650" end="00:48:39.369" style="s2">do we grow this to be bigger then how do</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.839" end="00:48:41.470" style="s2">we keep growing it to be bigger because</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.369" end="00:48:43.420" style="s2">technology can solve many of our complex</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.470" end="00:48:45.759" style="s2">problems but if we don&#39;t have that</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.420" end="00:48:47.410" style="s2">10,000 people we haven&#39;t solved it right</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.759" end="00:48:49.480" style="s2">we can&#39;t easily get a hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.410" end="00:48:51.549" style="s2">we can&#39;t split it into 100 and so</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.480" end="00:48:53.499" style="s2">technology&#39;s not the problem it&#39;s how do</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.549" end="00:48:55.359" style="s2">you actually get a group of people to</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.499" end="00:48:56.140" style="s2">know that this thing exists how do you</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.359" end="00:48:57.580" style="s2">get</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.140" end="00:49:00.730" style="s2">how do you build from there but I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.580" end="00:49:03.060" style="s2">this 100 hundred is like so many people</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.730" end="00:49:06.120" style="s2">want to live in community how do we</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.060" end="00:49:08.290" style="s2">start from that place right of like</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.120" end="00:49:10.720" style="s2">getting 10,000 people watching this</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.290" end="00:49:12.760" style="s2">video right or getting 10,000 people to</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.720" end="00:49:15.880" style="s2">participate in this type of conversation</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.760" end="00:49:17.740" style="s2">or how do we like yeah so I think there</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.880" end="00:49:19.720" style="s2">are two problems that this solves and I</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.740" end="00:49:21.790" style="s2">think that there&#39;s an existing way that</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.720" end="00:49:23.590" style="s2">we can approach collecting this</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.790" end="00:49:26.470" style="s2">community the first problem is if you</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.590" end="00:49:27.550" style="s2">take a an intentional community and you</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.470" end="00:49:29.410" style="s2">look at all of the different reasons</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.550" end="00:49:33.220" style="s2">that they have their life cycle and</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.410" end="00:49:34.690" style="s2">eventually fall apart one is how do you</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.220" end="00:49:36.430" style="s2">get the right distribution of people</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.690" end="00:49:38.890" style="s2">with enough expertise to make that</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.430" end="00:49:40.960" style="s2">community self-sufficient and this</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.890" end="00:49:42.820" style="s2">solves that by saying you don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.960" end="00:49:44.800" style="s2">have a hundred doctors you need to have</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.820" end="00:49:47.980" style="s2">one doctor connected to another 99</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.800" end="00:49:51.370" style="s2">doctors and to share that expertise the</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.980" end="00:49:54.160" style="s2">other problem is how much power and</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.370" end="00:49:56.980" style="s2">sovereignty can we wield as a group of a</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.160" end="00:49:59.110" style="s2">hundred or 150 people on our land and</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.980" end="00:50:01.030" style="s2">all of the problems to do with land</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.110" end="00:50:02.590" style="s2">ownership and government and everything</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.030" end="00:50:05.530" style="s2">that comes up around a community of that</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.590" end="00:50:09.040" style="s2">size that doesn&#39;t have the power to to</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.530" end="00:50:10.870" style="s2">fight back or to maintain stability and</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.040" end="00:50:13.060" style="s2">so you&#39;re solving these things you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.870" end="00:50:16.030" style="s2">saying well we have physical community</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.060" end="00:50:18.100" style="s2">with a network and we can actually say</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.030" end="00:50:19.900" style="s2">we&#39;re a community of 10,000 where</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.100" end="00:50:21.670" style="s2">physically distributed but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.900" end="00:50:23.920" style="s2">10,000 of us that can get behind</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.670" end="00:50:26.550" style="s2">something that needs to be done in an</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.920" end="00:50:28.570" style="s2">emergency we can pull resources we can</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.550" end="00:50:30.880" style="s2">you know I don&#39;t know how that would</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.570" end="00:50:32.590" style="s2">work legally and everything like that</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.880" end="00:50:34.330" style="s2">but I&#39;m sure that 10,000 people</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.590" end="00:50:36.430" style="s2">connected with some kind of social</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.330" end="00:50:39.520" style="s2">contract makes a much bigger difference</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.430" end="00:50:42.490" style="s2">than 150 and so potentially a place that</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.520" end="00:50:44.950" style="s2">you can start is existing intentional</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.490" end="00:50:46.900" style="s2">communities and intentional communities</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.950" end="00:50:49.690" style="s2">that are about to start up and say don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.900" end="00:50:51.220" style="s2">stop what you&#39;re doing don&#39;t change to</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.690" end="00:50:53.950" style="s2">our project keep doing what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.220" end="00:50:55.690" style="s2">but join this group of 10,000 so that</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.950" end="00:50:58.510" style="s2">you can start to link up all of these</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.690" end="00:51:00.280" style="s2">communities each of which physically is</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.510" end="00:51:02.650" style="s2">going to have their own modus operandi</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.280" end="00:51:04.180" style="s2">their own particular set of interests</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.650" end="00:51:06.580" style="s2">some will be more environmental some</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.180" end="00:51:08.350" style="s2">will be more creative and so on but say</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.580" end="00:51:09.700" style="s2">you know get all of your people that are</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.350" end="00:51:11.350" style="s2">in that community</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.700" end="00:51:12.580" style="s2">into one of these subgroups around</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.350" end="00:51:15.040" style="s2">whatever it is that they&#39;re passionate</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.580" end="00:51:18.010" style="s2">about and start distributing those ideas</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.040" end="00:51:20.350" style="s2">to this bigger group and I think 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.010" end="00:51:22.990" style="s2">is a perfect kind of limit on the number</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.350" end="00:51:25.960" style="s2">of people that could network online in</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.990" end="00:51:28.870" style="s2">these small groups and still say we are</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.960" end="00:51:30.460" style="s2">a network of communities there is 100</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.870" end="00:51:36.670" style="s2">communities of a hundred people each</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.460" end="00:51:37.780" style="s2">approximately does that make sense you</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.670" end="00:51:38.860" style="s2">could even have because I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.780" end="00:51:43.000" style="s2">there&#39;s a hundred problems that need to</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.860" end="00:51:45.160" style="s2">be solved there probably are is having</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.000" end="00:51:47.380" style="s2">like redundancy right so you&#39;re on a</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.160" end="00:51:49.090" style="s2">group of ten and there&#39;s ten groups</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.380" end="00:51:51.040" style="s2">working on that problem and so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.090" end="00:51:53.170" style="s2">sharing interieur you&#39;re working as a</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.040" end="00:51:56.320" style="s2">more cohesive unit and then you&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.170" end="00:51:57.910" style="s2">connected with other ones and/or you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.320" end="00:51:59.500" style="s2">on different circles right so maybe I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.910" end="00:52:00.700" style="s2">on marketing if marketing is a thing</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.500" end="00:52:02.260" style="s2">right how do we end it is how do we</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.700" end="00:52:05.920" style="s2">attract people for our community when we</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.260" end="00:52:08.260" style="s2">have it and then it all the plumbing one</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.920" end="00:52:10.090" style="s2">right and so I might be on multiple ones</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.260" end="00:52:12.340" style="s2">that are within my capacity to be on</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.090" end="00:52:13.930" style="s2">them within my interest and because</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.340" end="00:52:14.950" style="s2">maybe that group of ten meets at Tuesday</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.930" end="00:52:16.840" style="s2">and I can meet with this one but not</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.950" end="00:52:18.310" style="s2">this one right and the more you&#39;re able</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.840" end="00:52:20.170" style="s2">to break it down but bring it back</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.310" end="00:52:24.130" style="s2">together as a cohesive whole for funding</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.170" end="00:52:26.680" style="s2">and information I love this yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.130" end="00:52:29.320" style="s2">only the only consideration with that is</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.680" end="00:52:32.050" style="s2">that if you if you do allow too much</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.320" end="00:52:33.640" style="s2">overlap then you&#39;ve lost the cohesion of</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.050" end="00:52:35.680" style="s2">the dunbar thing right because then all</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.640" end="00:52:37.450" style="s2">of a sudden you&#39;re in a big group of</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.680" end="00:52:39.220" style="s2">10,000 and you&#39;re in eighteen different</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.450" end="00:52:41.230" style="s2">check groups and so you&#39;ve lost that</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.220" end="00:52:43.660" style="s2">feeling of like right I&#39;m one of a one</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.230" end="00:52:46.540" style="s2">group inside a larger group so I can see</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.660" end="00:52:48.160" style="s2">some kind of process of checking in with</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.540" end="00:52:50.830" style="s2">these other groups but I think it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.160" end="00:52:52.810" style="s2">important to say like okay we are a</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.830" end="00:52:55.450" style="s2">group of a hundred and our problem to</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.810" end="00:52:57.970" style="s2">solve is food security that&#39;s it like</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.450" end="00:52:59.770" style="s2">that&#39;s my focus and I&#39;m sacrificing a</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.970" end="00:53:02.020" style="s2">little bit of my interest in other areas</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.770" end="00:53:04.000" style="s2">in this context in order to really make</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.020" end="00:53:06.220" style="s2">sure that I&#39;m solving that problem for</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.000" end="00:53:09.460" style="s2">the community and then maybe there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.220" end="00:53:11.020" style="s2">open forum for the arts group that I say</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.460" end="00:53:13.300" style="s2">you know I&#39;m really also interested in</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.020" end="00:53:15.250" style="s2">that but I&#39;m not responsible for it but</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.300" end="00:53:17.140" style="s2">I&#39;d love to be there at that open forum</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.250" end="00:53:19.120" style="s2">to talk to meet those people to talk</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.140" end="00:53:21.550" style="s2">about their ideas to throw in some ideas</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.120" end="00:53:23.140" style="s2">but I know what I&#39;m responsible for i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.550" end="00:53:23.559" style="s2">got clear marching orders and i know</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.140" end="00:53:26.469" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.559" end="00:53:28.479" style="s2">problems I need to solve but if I may if</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.469" end="00:53:30.789" style="s2">you&#39;re responsible for say food security</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.479" end="00:53:32.650" style="s2">then part of that is going it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.789" end="00:53:35.229" style="s2">necessarily going to be interfacing with</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.650" end="00:53:36.400" style="s2">waste management water production and</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.229" end="00:53:38.979" style="s2">you know what I mean you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.400" end="00:53:41.170" style="s2">gonna have to be and so I understand</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.979" end="00:53:42.339" style="s2">you&#39;ve got yeah I completely understand</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.170" end="00:53:44.469" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying about distributing</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.339" end="00:53:45.910" style="s2">your attention to widely so you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.469" end="00:53:48.549" style="s2">actually get on with the thing that is</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.910" end="00:53:50.469" style="s2">your primary goal but distributing your</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.549" end="00:53:53.079" style="s2">attention appropriately because it</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.469" end="00:53:55.809" style="s2">informs the thing that you&#39;re you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.079" end="00:53:58.180" style="s2">it forms your core purpose that that has</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.809" end="00:54:02.619" style="s2">to be done right yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.180" end="00:54:04.689" style="s2">personalities that tend to cross um like</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.619" end="00:54:06.279" style="s2">I do this and I&#39;ve noticed it&#39;s as part</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.689" end="00:54:09.910" style="s2">of social networks that I&#39;ve been in</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.279" end="00:54:11.289" style="s2">like um this arts activism and music</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.910" end="00:54:14.739" style="s2">scene I used to be at in Columbus Ohio</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.289" end="00:54:17.019" style="s2">um I was one of a hand you know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.739" end="00:54:19.029" style="s2">more than a handful maybe but well</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.019" end="00:54:21.189" style="s2">whatever one of the few one of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.029" end="00:54:25.209" style="s2">smaller percentage that crossed a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.189" end="00:54:27.519" style="s2">like nodes like I had punk friends I had</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.209" end="00:54:30.400" style="s2">goth friends I had hippie friends I had</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.519" end="00:54:34.539" style="s2">you know like classical music friends I</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.400" end="00:54:36.309" style="s2">had Food Not Bombs friends hemp campaign</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.539" end="00:54:38.439" style="s2">fan you know all these different little</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.309" end="00:54:40.059" style="s2">like small tight-knit little clusters of</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.439" end="00:54:43.119" style="s2">community in this various overlapping</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.059" end="00:54:45.429" style="s2">scenes I was one of the small percentage</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.119" end="00:54:48.249" style="s2">of people that crossed into lots of</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.429" end="00:54:49.900" style="s2">different ones you know like ran along</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.249" end="00:54:51.699" style="s2">the liminal spaces in-between and made</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.900" end="00:54:53.819" style="s2">interconnections and introduced people</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.699" end="00:54:56.049" style="s2">between those communities and</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.819" end="00:54:59.019" style="s2">transferred information between those</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.049" end="00:55:01.410" style="s2">communities I think there are other</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.019" end="00:55:04.269" style="s2">people like me that tend to do that um</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.410" end="00:55:07.509" style="s2">what we can do in a network of community</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.269" end="00:55:09.069" style="s2">of communities nested communities is you</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.509" end="00:55:10.569" style="s2">can have the people within the group</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.069" end="00:55:13.299" style="s2">that are tend to be a little more</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.569" end="00:55:17.349" style="s2">outreach broadly gregarious or broadly</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.299" end="00:55:18.759" style="s2">collecting interest um you could let</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.349" end="00:55:20.319" style="s2">them kind of be a facilitator that</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.759" end="00:55:22.059" style="s2">speaks a bit for that note you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.319" end="00:55:25.569" style="s2">ten people working on the food security</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.059" end="00:55:29.410" style="s2">issue one of them can kind of touch base</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.569" end="00:55:30.819" style="s2">with a group of you know five other</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.410" end="00:55:32.380" style="s2">people that come from groups they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.819" end="00:55:34.719" style="s2">also looking at food security from</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.380" end="00:55:37.239" style="s2">different angles and stay in touch on a</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.719" end="00:55:37.450" style="s2">shared page where they post updates and</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.239" end="00:55:38.920" style="s2">key</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.450" end="00:55:40.930" style="s2">a little bit of like a contact with each</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.920" end="00:55:43.150" style="s2">other to know a little bit of you of</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.930" end="00:55:46.270" style="s2">what all five groups are doing you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.150" end="00:55:49.000" style="s2">and so not everybody in the group has to</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.270" end="00:55:50.859" style="s2">be looking outward to the other groups</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.000" end="00:55:52.390" style="s2">that are working on food security you</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.859" end="00:55:54.640" style="s2">can have individuals that are naturally</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.390" end="00:55:56.530" style="s2">personality inclined to do so take</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.640" end="00:55:59.260" style="s2">responsible for building that inner mesh</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.530" end="00:56:01.359" style="s2">network the mycelium that connects the</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.260" end="00:56:02.829" style="s2">forest floor and moves resources when</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.359" end="00:56:05.829" style="s2">information from one part to the other</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.829" end="00:56:07.810" style="s2">yeah that might be its own</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.829" end="00:56:09.430" style="s2">problem-solving group is a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.810" end="00:56:11.170" style="s2">people who are like hey we&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.430" end="00:56:12.280" style="s2">interconnected part and you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.170" end="00:56:15.220" style="s2">figure out how do we bring in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.280" end="00:56:18.339" style="s2">information from plumbing and food</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.220" end="00:56:24.250" style="s2">safety and I got goose bumps on that</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.339" end="00:56:26.170" style="s2">Jubilee thank you yeah you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.250" end="00:56:29.020" style="s2">what I would love like if I just think</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.170" end="00:56:31.450" style="s2">about this right now in this situation</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.020" end="00:56:33.130" style="s2">with all the energy that I had to want</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.450" end="00:56:36.070" style="s2">to do something where is that blocked</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.130" end="00:56:39.070" style="s2">where could that be be more clearly</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.070" end="00:56:42.130" style="s2">transferred what I wouldn&#39;t love to have</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.070" end="00:56:45.099" style="s2">for ten dollars input is an app that I</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.130" end="00:56:47.170" style="s2">could open up and it had my group of 100</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.099" end="00:56:49.210" style="s2">people that I&#39;d chosen around the things</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.170" end="00:56:51.190" style="s2">that I&#39;m passionate about and I could</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.210" end="00:56:53.319" style="s2">see what they were doing I knew what my</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.190" end="00:56:55.650" style="s2">problem was that I was focusing on I</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.319" end="00:56:58.089" style="s2">knew who I was connected to and I said</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.650" end="00:57:01.270" style="s2">whether these people are sharing the</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.089" end="00:57:02.710" style="s2">same group as I am or not there&#39;s 100</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.270" end="00:57:06.369" style="s2">people here that I can limit this</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.710" end="00:57:08.290" style="s2">massive social choice to and I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.369" end="00:57:09.700" style="s2">keep checking in with them and they</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.290" end="00:57:11.980" style="s2">might be all working on different things</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.700" end="00:57:14.980" style="s2">but it&#39;s some kind of limiting function</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.980" end="00:57:17.050" style="s2">that&#39;s like they I have a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.980" end="00:57:20.220" style="s2">around my problem-solving with each of</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.050" end="00:57:24.160" style="s2">these people and 100 is more than enough</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.220" end="00:57:26.859" style="s2">relationships to focus on to maintain my</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.160" end="00:57:29.200" style="s2">focus on my goal and so that that like</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.859" end="00:57:30.819" style="s2">give me that right now so that I can</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.200" end="00:57:32.440" style="s2">focus and I think that that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.819" end="00:57:34.270" style="s2">everyone&#39;s looking for now is how can I</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.440" end="00:57:36.010" style="s2">help and how can I make sure that my</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.270" end="00:57:37.540" style="s2">energy isn&#39;t going into many different</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.010" end="00:57:41.740" style="s2">ways and that what I do is actually</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.540" end="00:57:43.690" style="s2">useful my first thought was like that</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.740" end="00:57:44.800" style="s2">could be done quick as a webpage but</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.690" end="00:57:47.260" style="s2">having it as a free-standing</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.800" end="00:57:50.140" style="s2">app means you can hop on without the</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.260" end="00:57:50.760" style="s2">distraction of extra browser tabs and</p>

<p begin="00:57:57.270" end="00:58:00.210" style="s2">okay even within the wiki software I was</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.040" end="00:58:03.240" style="s2">talking one could do that as a</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.210" end="00:58:05.130" style="s2">free-standing page and make it as a node</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.240" end="00:58:07.410" style="s2">within wiki software when they forgot a</p>

<p begin="00:58:50.400" end="00:58:55.320" style="s2">have I started a Facebook group last a</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.890" end="00:58:56.670" style="s2">few days ago called solution magazine so</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.320" end="00:58:57.840" style="s2">that I&#39;ll hopefully we will know how</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.670" end="00:58:59.430" style="s2">many people are participating and then</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.840" end="00:59:00.630" style="s2">we can do things like break out onto</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.430" end="00:59:02.850" style="s2">zoom because it&#39;s about having the</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.630" end="00:59:04.290" style="s2">conversation I would love to record them</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.850" end="00:59:06.270" style="s2">and provide them to the world so people</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.290" end="00:59:08.220" style="s2">can see what is possible but the main</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.270" end="00:59:10.380" style="s2">part is how do we have a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.220" end="00:59:12.120" style="s2">that&#39;s generative and then we&#39;ll start</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.380" end="00:59:14.250" style="s2">having the conversations up like great</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.120" end="00:59:16.680" style="s2">now how do we make it look how do we</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.250" end="00:59:18.750" style="s2">actually create one of these things now</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.680" end="00:59:20.610" style="s2">we will do a solution raising on</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.750" end="00:59:22.980" style="s2">solution raising like what are we</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.610" end="00:59:24.780" style="s2">currently doing ideal world what could</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.980" end="00:59:26.010" style="s2">we do at the tangent with the possible</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.780" end="00:59:28.620" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s our first project we</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.010" end="00:59:30.000" style="s2">actually actually concert on but I kind</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.620" end="00:59:39.810" style="s2">of gave my own closing statements any</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.000" end="00:59:42.240" style="s2">one spark of an idea what if we had a</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.810" end="00:59:45.090" style="s2">social media way you were limited to 100</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.240" end="00:59:47.460" style="s2">friends that&#39;s all I&#39;ll say and you had</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.090" end="00:59:50.400" style="s2">to choose those people wisely other than</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.460" end="00:59:52.290" style="s2">that this has been my first online sense</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.400" end="00:59:55.400" style="s2">making call and I just want to thank you</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.290" end="00:59:57.930" style="s2">all for welcoming me into that world and</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.400" end="00:59:59.190" style="s2">introducing yourselves all today yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.930" end="01:00:00.600" style="s2">thank you I don&#39;t know if we really</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.190" end="01:00:04.080" style="s2">introduced ourselves sorry about that</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.600" end="01:00:06.480" style="s2">but more focused Eric did you want to</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.080" end="01:00:08.850" style="s2">yeah two very very quick thoughts</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.480" end="01:00:10.710" style="s2">firstly excellent call really enjoyed it</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.850" end="01:00:14.940" style="s2">thought it was a genuinely constructive</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.710" end="01:00:16.920" style="s2">and generative call and secondly I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.940" end="01:00:19.170" style="s2">know if any of the 20 the rest of you</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.920" end="01:00:22.830" style="s2">but one notion which has been sort of</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.170" end="01:00:24.870" style="s2">tacitly accepted throughout is the idea</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.830" end="01:00:27.900" style="s2">of the Dunbar sized community right we</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.870" end="01:00:31.500" style="s2">all that we all seem to explicitly or</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.900" end="01:00:33.300" style="s2">tacitly agree with that notion so yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.500" end="01:00:37.110" style="s2">found that very interesting that seems</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.300" end="01:00:39.270" style="s2">to be an unquestioned truth somehow now</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.110" end="01:00:41.030" style="s2">whether it&#39;s just painted as Jamie</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.270" end="01:00:44.790" style="s2">describes it or whether there is</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.030" end="01:00:46.770" style="s2">actually an actual thing I&#39;m down with</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.790" end="01:00:48.690" style="s2">it as an aesthetic whether it holds up</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.770" end="01:00:50.460" style="s2">in an academic research or not you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.690" end="01:00:52.500" style="s2">well there is there is academic</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.460" end="01:00:54.450" style="s2">underpinning I do know something about</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.500" end="01:00:57.270" style="s2">Dunbar&#39;s research and it is to do with</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.450" end="01:01:00.480" style="s2">frontal lobe size in relation to overall</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.270" end="01:01:02.310" style="s2">brain size therefore so there is an</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.480" end="01:01:19.380" style="s2">actual underpinning it is it&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.310" end="01:01:21.510" style="s2">arbitrary number and watching so thank</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.380" end="01:01:23.940" style="s2">you I don&#39;t have you know that I had I</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.510" end="01:01:25.950" style="s2">had some various thoughts about you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.940" end="01:01:29.270" style="s2">in terms of personality profiling and</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.950" end="01:01:31.680" style="s2">stuff like that and but in but I think</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.270" end="01:01:33.110" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s more to be had on this</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.680" end="01:01:35.850" style="s2">conversation so I&#39;ve looked</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.110" end="01:01:37.230" style="s2">participating in more of it Stacy I saw</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.850" end="01:01:39.720" style="s2">you just unmuted did you want to say</p>

<p begin="01:01:52.560" end="01:01:58.530" style="s2">what it is it seriously could be I was</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.070" end="01:02:00.390" style="s2">sick two weeks ago for about eight days</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.530" end="01:02:02.820" style="s2">but at the time they were still saying</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.390" end="01:02:04.710" style="s2">that you could only get the corona virus</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.820" end="01:02:07.680" style="s2">if you had travelled so I figured okay</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.710" end="01:02:11.490" style="s2">then this can&#39;t be it Reavers and so by</p>
