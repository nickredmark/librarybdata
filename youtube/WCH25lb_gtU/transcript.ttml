<p begin="00:02:05.270" end="00:02:14.780" style="s2">you guys a a sense of what we&#39;re hoping</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.629" end="00:02:16.879" style="s2">for here um the social design or least</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.780" end="00:02:18.049" style="s2">the way that I think about social design</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.879" end="00:02:20.720" style="s2">all the people think about social design</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.049" end="00:02:23.090" style="s2">is kind of it&#39;s our own distinct field</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.720" end="00:02:24.799" style="s2">is different from UX design or graphic</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.090" end="00:02:26.719" style="s2">design or other aspects of design in</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.799" end="00:02:28.159" style="s2">that it&#39;s really dealing with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.719" end="00:02:29.390" style="s2">relationships between people and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.159" end="00:02:31.640" style="s2">relationships between communi</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.390" end="00:02:34.819" style="s2">and how the design you create shapes</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.640" end="00:02:37.400" style="s2">those and the hope is that we can kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.819" end="00:02:41.380" style="s2">of create a community of practice here</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.400" end="00:02:44.569" style="s2">where we can really improve our own</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.380" end="00:02:46.820" style="s2">designs and our own kind of skills and</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.569" end="00:02:49.010" style="s2">thinking about design both through the</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.820" end="00:02:51.020" style="s2">human systems lens with the frameworks</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.010" end="00:02:54.170" style="s2">that human systems offers but also just</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.020" end="00:02:58.010" style="s2">with people&#39;s own desire knowledge so</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.170" end="00:03:01.880" style="s2">this is the first very first one and</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.010" end="00:03:05.840" style="s2">we&#39;re very lucky to have Malcom ocean</p>

<p begin="00:03:05.840" end="00:03:10.190" style="s2">to do a lot you know a lot more of these</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.280" end="00:03:12.620" style="s2">and if you have a design that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.190" end="00:03:14.120" style="s2">interested in getting feedback on or</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.620" end="00:03:17.180" style="s2">presenting in front of the social design</p>

<p begin="00:03:33.620" end="00:03:38.150" style="s2">and he&#39;s probably the person who I spent</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.200" end="00:03:39.620" style="s2">the most time talking to in proportion</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.150" end="00:03:42.590" style="s2">to how much time I&#39;ve spent talking to a</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.620" end="00:03:44.390" style="s2">new person we have collaborated on a lot</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.590" end="00:03:45.709" style="s2">of things over the internet and he has</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.390" end="00:03:48.170" style="s2">built for the last several years a</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.709" end="00:03:50.840" style="s2">system called compass which is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.170" end="00:03:54.799" style="s2">productivity system that&#39;s aiming on</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.840" end="00:03:56.390" style="s2">aiming at helping you focus on what</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.799" end="00:03:59.660" style="s2">matters to you and your in your goals</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.390" end="00:04:01.010" style="s2">are in every everyday and so what we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:04:01.010" end="00:04:06.170" style="s2">present a bit about accomplice and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.590" end="00:04:08.840" style="s2">a feature that he&#39;s working on or</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.170" end="00:04:10.549" style="s2">workshopping um and then we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.840" end="00:04:12.970" style="s2">get a chance to really dive into that</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.549" end="00:04:16.150" style="s2">into some breakout rooms and give him</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.970" end="00:04:19.280" style="s2">some ideas and thoughts and everything</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.150" end="00:04:20.600" style="s2">and some feedback so I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.280" end="00:04:24.740" style="s2">Jonathas anything you want to add before</p>

<p begin="00:04:24.740" end="00:04:28.850" style="s2">say that um I think this is a really</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.169" end="00:04:30.820" style="s2">important community of practice to build</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.850" end="00:04:33.289" style="s2">and I&#39;m a little embarrassed that I</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.820" end="00:04:35.330" style="s2">wasn&#39;t part of building something like</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.289" end="00:04:38.000" style="s2">this earlier because I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.330" end="00:04:39.919" style="s2">complaining about social networks social</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.000" end="00:04:41.060" style="s2">apps have started like nonprofits that</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.919" end="00:04:42.580" style="s2">are about complaining about social</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.060" end="00:04:44.349" style="s2">networks</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.580" end="00:04:48.099" style="s2">more recently complaining about you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.349" end="00:04:51.009" style="s2">our systems for voting this the last</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.099" end="00:04:53.500" style="s2">weeks policing you know we have really</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.009" end="00:04:55.449" style="s2">bad social designs that are causing all</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.500" end="00:04:57.189" style="s2">sorts of problems at many different</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.449" end="00:05:00.310" style="s2">levels of society and yet there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.189" end="00:05:03.759" style="s2">very much of a community that&#39;s focused</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.310" end="00:05:07.319" style="s2">on getting better at this and I think we</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.759" end="00:05:10.479" style="s2">really need it right now and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.319" end="00:05:12.189" style="s2">that&#39;s super exciting for me too like I</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.479" end="00:05:19.479" style="s2">think this this this group could become</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.189" end="00:05:22.750" style="s2">a very powerful thing so I guess we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.479" end="00:05:25.479" style="s2">kick off with Malcolm he&#39;s just going to</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.750" end="00:05:28.840" style="s2">explain a little bit about compass and</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.479" end="00:05:31.150" style="s2">then afterwards we&#39;re gonna jump into a</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.840" end="00:05:33.940" style="s2">QA and so if you have questions that</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.150" end="00:05:36.190" style="s2">come up either while he&#39;s speaking or</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.940" end="00:05:40.719" style="s2">while we&#39;re asking some questions then</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.190" end="00:05:45.340" style="s2">pop them in the chat and we will we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.719" end="00:05:49.229" style="s2">take those questions yeah Malcolm you</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.340" end="00:05:49.229" style="s2">want to unmute yourself</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.540" end="00:05:59.930" style="s2">yeah hey can everybody hear me cool</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.210" end="00:06:02.180" style="s2">alright so um so yeah I&#39;m Malcolm ocean</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.930" end="00:06:05.330" style="s2">I created a system a number of years ago</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.180" end="00:06:07.280" style="s2">called com+ and I&#39;ll give you kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.330" end="00:06:09.680" style="s2">brief overview demo of kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.280" end="00:06:11.600" style="s2">system as a whole and and then I&#39;ll talk</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.680" end="00:06:13.220" style="s2">about a feature that I I started working</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.600" end="00:06:14.390" style="s2">on a few years ago and never launched</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.220" end="00:06:17.470" style="s2">and I was thinking it would be a cool</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.390" end="00:06:20.900" style="s2">thing to present at social design Club</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.470" end="00:06:32.330" style="s2">so let&#39;s see sure screen oh I need</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.900" end="00:06:35.390" style="s2">screen sharing abilities so yeah so so</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.330" end="00:06:39.020" style="s2">basically accomplice kind of looks a lot</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.390" end="00:06:41.960" style="s2">like a to-do list app but it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.020" end="00:06:43.520" style="s2">its kind of inside out compared to an</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.960" end="00:06:45.440" style="s2">ordinary to-do list app but most to-do</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.520" end="00:06:47.840" style="s2">list apps are like dumped in all of your</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.440" end="00:06:52.280" style="s2">things organize them that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.840" end="00:06:53.990" style="s2">com+ instead starts with what am I</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.280" end="00:06:57.770" style="s2">actually trying to achieve in the world</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.990" end="00:07:05.030" style="s2">and then each day you kind of focus on</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.770" end="00:07:06.650" style="s2">that and so so I&#39;ll just sort of show</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.030" end="00:07:10.580" style="s2">you the kind of the basic structure of</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.650" end="00:07:15.710" style="s2">the UI you have a list of kind of active</p>

<p begin="00:09:05.860" end="00:09:10.150" style="s2">workflows then a lot of sort of to-do</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.810" end="00:09:11.620" style="s2">list manager apps so it&#39;s like you go</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.150" end="00:09:12.970" style="s2">into next action mode and then it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.620" end="00:09:16.540" style="s2">like well here&#39;s just slow but the one</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.970" end="00:09:17.830" style="s2">thing I&#39;m doing right now and then so</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.540" end="00:09:19.570" style="s2">after setting your intentions for the</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.830" end="00:09:21.550" style="s2">day you know you do things you have a</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.570" end="00:09:23.920" style="s2">Pomodoro timer at the end of the day you</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.550" end="00:09:26.890" style="s2">submit your outcomes and you reflect on</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.920" end="00:09:29.950" style="s2">like how how is what I did towards each</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.890" end="00:09:32.590" style="s2">of these goals how does that connect</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.950" end="00:09:33.910" style="s2">with the goal um you know what was I in</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.590" end="00:09:35.830" style="s2">touch with the goal was I out of touch</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.910" end="00:09:37.480" style="s2">et cetera and there&#39;s a few different</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.830" end="00:09:38.740" style="s2">versions of questions here that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.480" end="00:09:40.480" style="s2">actually something I&#39;ll say I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.740" end="00:09:43.450" style="s2">designing but not what we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.480" end="00:09:44.560" style="s2">talk about today so then of course you</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.450" end="00:09:49.960" style="s2">have a history you know you can look</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.560" end="00:09:53.260" style="s2">back over what you&#39;ve what you&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.960" end="00:09:55.180" style="s2">in the course of you know the past days</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.260" end="00:09:58.270" style="s2">and weeks and then there&#39;s also kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.180" end="00:09:59.800" style="s2">reviews where you can reflect on you</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.270" end="00:10:00.940" style="s2">know here&#39;s how the whole week went you</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.800" end="00:10:02.410" style="s2">know and you ask yourself certain</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.940" end="00:10:07.090" style="s2">questions so that&#39;s kind of a high-level</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.410" end="00:10:08.500" style="s2">overview of the app itself and so a</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.090" end="00:10:09.880" style="s2">couple of years ago I started thinking</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.500" end="00:10:10.300" style="s2">well okay so it&#39;s like I&#39;ve got my</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.880" end="00:10:14.770" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.300" end="00:10:16.300" style="s2">goals but how do I want to relate to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.770" end="00:10:18.280" style="s2">idea that like some of my goals are just</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.300" end="00:10:20.560" style="s2">about my own life but other goals that I</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.280" end="00:10:23.230" style="s2">have are about changing things you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.560" end="00:10:30.550" style="s2">in the world so like you know maybe I</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.230" end="00:10:31.930" style="s2">have a goal that&#39;s about you know you</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.550" end="00:10:34.990" style="s2">know the environment or maybe I have a</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.930" end="00:10:36.970" style="s2">goal that&#39;s about helping people in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.990" end="00:10:38.680" style="s2">world be better at a particular skill or</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.970" end="00:10:40.440" style="s2">something like that well that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.680" end="00:10:42.940" style="s2">something that multiple people are</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.440" end="00:10:44.200" style="s2">trying to achieve like I&#39;m not the only</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.940" end="00:10:46.480" style="s2">one trying to care for the environment</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.200" end="00:10:48.100" style="s2">I&#39;m not the only person trying to you</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.480" end="00:10:51.010" style="s2">know reduce the chances of there being</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.100" end="00:10:52.180" style="s2">global catastrophic risks you know there</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.010" end="00:10:54.640" style="s2">are a lot of people out there right now</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.180" end="00:10:58.980" style="s2">who in many different ways are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.640" end="00:11:01.630" style="s2">mitigate the impacts of kovat right so</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.980" end="00:11:04.810" style="s2">so I was when I created the the shared</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.630" end="00:11:06.340" style="s2">purposes feature and the basic idea with</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.810" end="00:11:08.800" style="s2">the shared purposes feature is you have</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.340" end="00:11:10.600" style="s2">some something out there that multiple</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.800" end="00:11:12.100" style="s2">people care about and these are mostly</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.600" end="00:11:14.920" style="s2">just some examples I whipped up a while</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.100" end="00:11:20.590" style="s2">ago um but if we&#39;ll just take this one</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.920" end="00:11:22.300" style="s2">as an example so so basically you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.590" end="00:11:24.790" style="s2">there&#39;s multiple people who have been</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.300" end="00:11:28.290" style="s2">talking about metasomatism mehta</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.790" end="00:11:32.770" style="s2">rationality or fluid mode or so on and</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.290" end="00:11:34.570" style="s2">so this page then highlights kind of you</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.770" end="00:11:36.610" style="s2">know there&#39;s this shared purpose that</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.570" end="00:11:38.530" style="s2">people have of trying to convey to</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.610" end="00:11:41.410" style="s2">people how would we operate in fluid</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.530" end="00:11:43.930" style="s2">mode and so I can point this design goal</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.410" end="00:11:46.750" style="s2">that I have towards that and then it</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.930" end="00:11:48.430" style="s2">sort of shows you know here&#39;s here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.750" end="00:11:51.700" style="s2">what I&#39;m working on</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.430" end="00:11:54.640" style="s2">you know today for instance and and this</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.700" end="00:12:01.510" style="s2">box right here really think I&#39;m maybe</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.640" end="00:12:04.360" style="s2">going like a little fast or something so</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.510" end="00:12:05.950" style="s2">I was really trying like I want to take</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.360" end="00:12:07.270" style="s2">a step back and just say like the image</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.950" end="00:12:09.610" style="s2">I had in mind when I was thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.270" end="00:12:12.100" style="s2">this was almost like somebody like kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.610" end="00:12:14.130" style="s2">of plants a flag around an idea and says</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.100" end="00:12:16.540" style="s2">like hey this thing is important like</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.130" end="00:12:18.430" style="s2">you know what if we focused on this and</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.540" end="00:12:20.830" style="s2">other people recognized like hey I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.430" end="00:12:23.350" style="s2">also sort of focused on this so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.830" end="00:12:23.860" style="s2">a kind of like coming into connection</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.350" end="00:12:26.260" style="s2">with people</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.860" end="00:12:30.040" style="s2">who are already with people who are also</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.260" end="00:12:32.440" style="s2">oriented towards some shared purpose and</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.040" end="00:12:34.390" style="s2">my thinking with this was you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.440" end="00:12:35.950" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of you know productivity</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.390" end="00:12:38.470" style="s2">apps and whatnot that are like designed</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.950" end="00:12:40.480" style="s2">for like teams to coordinate towards</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.470" end="00:12:43.000" style="s2">like shared it like you know towards</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.480" end="00:12:46.540" style="s2">their company mission or that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.000" end="00:12:50.050" style="s2">thing but a lot of them have implicitly</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.540" end="00:12:52.149" style="s2">a kind of top-down this there&#39;s a the</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.050" end="00:12:54.970" style="s2">the thing in the middle is we&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.149" end="00:12:57.010" style="s2">company and and you know somebody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.970" end="00:12:58.329" style="s2">making decisions about what needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.010" end="00:13:01.149" style="s2">done and then we&#39;re kind of all doing it</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.329" end="00:13:03.430" style="s2">um and I said what does it look like to</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.149" end="00:13:05.200" style="s2">just like thinking about maybe Donella</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.430" end="00:13:07.360" style="s2">Meadows leverage points and the leverage</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.200" end="00:13:10.120" style="s2">point that like information flow is I</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.360" end="00:13:11.890" style="s2">think number five it&#39;s like what</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.120" end="00:13:14.470" style="s2">difference does it make to see other</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.890" end="00:13:16.060" style="s2">people working on projects that are</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.470" end="00:13:17.740" style="s2">trying to move the same needles in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.060" end="00:13:20.170" style="s2">world as you like how can that be both</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.740" end="00:13:22.480" style="s2">motivating or inspiring or create the</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.170" end="00:13:26.320" style="s2">context where people might come into</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.480" end="00:13:27.880" style="s2">relationship with each other and and</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.320" end="00:13:29.829" style="s2">possibly collaborate on different</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.880" end="00:13:31.000" style="s2">projects that that might be related</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.829" end="00:13:32.440" style="s2">there or be able to share other</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.000" end="00:13:34.600" style="s2">information like oh you&#39;re working on</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.440" end="00:13:36.220" style="s2">this well check out this article that</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.600" end="00:13:38.589" style="s2">might help you out so those are the</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.220" end="00:13:40.480" style="s2">kinds of like interactions that I was</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.589" end="00:13:42.880" style="s2">imagining happening from this I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.480" end="00:13:45.459" style="s2">think that the feature is at all at this</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.880" end="00:13:47.230" style="s2">point sort of capable of creating most</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.459" end="00:13:49.899" style="s2">of those interactions aside from just</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.230" end="00:13:51.399" style="s2">seeing other people working on the thing</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.899" end="00:13:51.760" style="s2">together and I&#39;ll show you what it looks</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.399" end="00:13:54.399" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.760" end="00:13:57.010" style="s2">when you go to you click a button point</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.399" end="00:13:58.570" style="s2">point a goal towards this purpose so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.010" end="00:14:00.430" style="s2">gonna say actually that you know I have</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.570" end="00:14:02.019" style="s2">a goal called system&#39;s thinking which is</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.430" end="00:14:03.670" style="s2">mostly about learning systems thinking</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.019" end="00:14:05.230" style="s2">but also about modeling systems and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.670" end="00:14:08.820" style="s2">forth and I&#39;m gonna say yeah this goal</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.230" end="00:14:12.250" style="s2">actually is um it&#39;s quite relevant to</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.820" end="00:14:17.579" style="s2">you know metasomatism curriculum because</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.250" end="00:14:24.510" style="s2">systems thinking seems like and fairly</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.579" end="00:14:30.579" style="s2">established discipline resonance with</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.510" end="00:14:32.589" style="s2">meta systematicity and this is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.579" end="00:14:35.350" style="s2">like a description of like how how is</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.589" end="00:14:37.480" style="s2">systems thinking related to metasomatism</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.350" end="00:14:40.180" style="s2">so you get to kind of write in there</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.480" end="00:14:42.940" style="s2">something that links your goal with this</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.180" end="00:14:45.280" style="s2">larger purpose and then what&#39;s cool is</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.940" end="00:14:47.860" style="s2">depending on your sense of like privacy</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.280" end="00:14:50.800" style="s2">of the goal you can actually click each</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.860" end="00:14:52.150" style="s2">of these items so this this line here is</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.800" end="00:14:55.090" style="s2">the description of my systems-thinking</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.150" end="00:14:56.680" style="s2">goal if that contained like private</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.090" end="00:14:58.180" style="s2">information I could hide that so it</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.680" end="00:15:00.430" style="s2">doesn&#39;t actually get shared as part of</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.180" end="00:15:01.630" style="s2">this purpose or I could say actually I</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.430" end="00:15:03.430" style="s2">don&#39;t want people to see what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.630" end="00:15:05.020" style="s2">working on I just want them to see that</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.430" end="00:15:06.010" style="s2">I&#39;m connected with this purpose that</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.020" end="00:15:07.720" style="s2">what I&#39;m working on contains</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.010" end="00:15:08.980" style="s2">confidential information but they can</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.720" end="00:15:11.290" style="s2">see that I&#39;m working on so then I could</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.980" end="00:15:14.170" style="s2">like I could I could hide these by</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.290" end="00:15:16.180" style="s2">clicking on them it also might be that</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.170" end="00:15:19.420" style="s2">under some circumstances that it makes</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.180" end="00:15:22.810" style="s2">sense to you know edit the name of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.420" end="00:15:25.060" style="s2">goal because the goal might might be</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.810" end="00:15:26.740" style="s2">named for me and I might want a</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.060" end="00:15:29.200" style="s2">different name for other people to see</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.740" end="00:15:32.110" style="s2">in relation to that so I do all of those</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.200" end="00:15:33.790" style="s2">and then I just hit save and now Systems</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.110" end="00:15:37.060" style="s2">thinking is kind of added to this pile</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.790" end="00:15:39.160" style="s2">of goals that are all pointed at the</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.060" end="00:15:40.840" style="s2">meta systematicity curriculum that is</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.160" end="00:15:42.610" style="s2">basically what exists so far but I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.840" end="00:15:43.870" style="s2">in the context of the social design Club</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.610" end="00:15:45.970" style="s2">it also makes sense to show you the</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.870" end="00:15:47.470" style="s2">settings page to give you just a little</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.970" end="00:15:50.560" style="s2">bit of a sense of how I&#39;ve been thinking</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.470" end="00:15:52.270" style="s2">if I go back um which is basically</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.560" end="00:15:54.150" style="s2">currently this you know just sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.270" end="00:15:58.360" style="s2">name and a description and so forth and</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.150" end="00:16:01.330" style="s2">then there is visibility so is this you</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.360" end="00:16:03.370" style="s2">know listed and discoverable or is it</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.330" end="00:16:05.860" style="s2">you know unlisted like but you can find</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.370" end="00:16:07.660" style="s2">it via a URL or private kind of pretty</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.860" end="00:16:09.400" style="s2">typical three categories that YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.660" end="00:16:12.790" style="s2">has as well and then there&#39;s also like</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.400" end="00:16:16.780" style="s2">joint ability has either anybody or</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.790" end="00:16:19.120" style="s2">invite-only or requests as in like this</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.780" end="00:16:21.490" style="s2">purpose is like kind of a is kind of my</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.120" end="00:16:23.290" style="s2">project right like so I&#39;m not like you</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.490" end="00:16:25.180" style="s2">can&#39;t just say hey I&#39;m also working on</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.290" end="00:16:26.320" style="s2">this project with you but you can say</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.180" end="00:16:28.180" style="s2">hey I&#39;d like to work on this project</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.320" end="00:16:31.870" style="s2">with you and so that way there can be</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.180" end="00:16:34.260" style="s2">kind of more of a membrane around who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.870" end="00:16:36.790" style="s2">working on a particular purpose so</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.260" end="00:16:38.320" style="s2">that&#39;s the shared purposes thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.790" end="00:16:40.120" style="s2">kind of all that exists so far I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.320" end="00:16:42.490" style="s2">it needs a little bit more in order for</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.120" end="00:16:43.840" style="s2">to be able be able to really be the</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.490" end="00:16:45.430" style="s2">thing that it wants to be and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.840" end="00:16:47.850" style="s2">I didn&#39;t take off when I try presenting</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.430" end="00:16:51.900" style="s2">it to a group of effective altruists</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.850" end="00:16:51.900" style="s2">back in 2017</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.120" end="00:16:58.390" style="s2">yeah but I think I think it has a</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.279" end="00:17:01.390" style="s2">powerful chance to potentially be a cool</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.390" end="00:17:03.339" style="s2">thing at the present you know even just</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.390" end="00:17:07.179" style="s2">like related to like Cova door related</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.339" end="00:17:08.860" style="s2">to you know the kinds of shared projects</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.179" end="00:17:12.480" style="s2">that people seem in some ways more</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.860" end="00:17:18.429" style="s2">oriented to under the with the whole</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.480" end="00:17:21.179" style="s2">meta-crisis and everything so yeah so I</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.429" end="00:17:24.939" style="s2">would invite people at this point to</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.179" end="00:17:27.189" style="s2">notice things that you are curious about</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.939" end="00:17:28.600" style="s2">or maybe didn&#39;t want to learn more about</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.189" end="00:17:32.200" style="s2">if there&#39;s anything in this that you</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.600" end="00:17:35.170" style="s2">kind of want to what would like mountain</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.200" end="00:17:38.650" style="s2">to kind of explain a bit more and pop</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.170" end="00:17:39.910" style="s2">those questions in the chat and Joe I</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.650" end="00:17:46.720" style="s2">don&#39;t know if you have any questions you</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.910" end="00:17:51.150" style="s2">want to start off with yeah I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.720" end="00:17:53.770" style="s2">a beautiful it&#39;s a beautiful idea I</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.150" end="00:17:55.990" style="s2">remember talking this Justin Rosenstein</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.770" end="00:17:58.360" style="s2">the one of the founders of asana once</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.990" end="00:18:01.570" style="s2">told me that this was kind of like his</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.360" end="00:18:03.640" style="s2">big dream goal of asana was to D</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.570" end="00:18:06.600" style="s2">aggregate the projects and goals and let</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.640" end="00:18:09.250" style="s2">people form cross cross organization</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.600" end="00:18:11.410" style="s2">goals like this but I guess he he hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.250" end="00:18:13.059" style="s2">gotten around to it yet yeah he made</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.410" end="00:18:16.240" style="s2">this thing called one project or</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.059" end="00:18:18.220" style="s2">something that was trying to frame all</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.240" end="00:18:20.679" style="s2">of what humanity was doing is one giant</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.220" end="00:18:22.330" style="s2">project and I really liked that frame I</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.679" end="00:18:26.140" style="s2">saw talk that he gave on that at Burning</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.330" end="00:18:27.640" style="s2">Man and I think I saw that talk actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.140" end="00:18:28.780" style="s2">just like a week or two after I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.640" end="00:18:31.900" style="s2">designing this so it&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.780" end="00:18:34.960" style="s2">convergent convergent thing cool yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.900" end="00:18:38.830" style="s2">I&#39;ll definitely send him the link to</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.960" end="00:18:41.350" style="s2">this recording so I&#39;m interested in a so</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.830" end="00:18:44.440" style="s2">when I look at at this I think about</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.350" end="00:18:46.300" style="s2">different kinds of collaboration values</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.440" end="00:18:49.090" style="s2">towards these kinds of beautiful meta</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.300" end="00:18:50.440" style="s2">goals that that I have one of them is</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.090" end="00:18:52.840" style="s2">that I like to encourage people to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.440" end="00:18:55.720" style="s2">like ambitious to reach for things try</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.840" end="00:18:58.410" style="s2">it ways to help out on a scale that they</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.720" end="00:19:00.820" style="s2">might not you know think about before so</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.410" end="00:19:03.680" style="s2">discoverability of these shared purposes</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.820" end="00:19:05.390" style="s2">is kind of like a relevant there right</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.680" end="00:19:07.160" style="s2">how would I start to become part of a</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.390" end="00:19:10.580" style="s2">shared purpose that I that I didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.160" end="00:19:12.250" style="s2">about before another thing is about</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.580" end="00:19:18.200" style="s2">getting real I think a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.250" end="00:19:19.880" style="s2">isolate themselves and work alone on on</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.200" end="00:19:21.680" style="s2">their project like they have you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.880" end="00:19:25.790" style="s2">their little</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.680" end="00:19:27.560" style="s2">I don&#39;t know idea about reinventing</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.790" end="00:19:29.890" style="s2">group process or something but they</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.560" end="00:19:32.570" style="s2">don&#39;t work with other people because</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.890" end="00:19:36.260" style="s2">that they&#39;re not really willing to do</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.570" end="00:19:38.720" style="s2">the kind of hard work of making things</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.260" end="00:19:44.750" style="s2">concrete that would be required to</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.720" end="00:19:46.910" style="s2">actually coordinate in a group and so I</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.750" end="00:19:48.350" style="s2">wonder about what kinds of design</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.910" end="00:19:52.460" style="s2">features would actually be necessary to</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.350" end="00:19:53.180" style="s2">support these kinds of things I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.460" end="00:19:58.190" style="s2">know if you have anything to say that</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.180" end="00:19:59.480" style="s2">that&#39;s quite yeah yeah um I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.190" end="00:20:01.340" style="s2">one of those things that has a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.480" end="00:20:03.980" style="s2">like a kind of chicken acting quality to</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.340" end="00:20:07.340" style="s2">it it&#39;s like I I love to imagine what</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.980" end="00:20:09.050" style="s2">this page would look like if if like</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.340" end="00:20:10.940" style="s2">this feature was being used by thousands</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.050" end="00:20:12.200" style="s2">of people I mean I think one thing is</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.940" end="00:20:13.550" style="s2">that would become unwieldy in its</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.200" end="00:20:15.350" style="s2">current form like you need a search</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.550" end="00:20:16.880" style="s2">feature you need a filter feature and</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.350" end="00:20:19.250" style="s2">you need like you know stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.880" end="00:20:21.980" style="s2">right so there&#39;s that but leaving that</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.250" end="00:20:25.580" style="s2">aside it&#39;s like what what kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.980" end="00:20:28.600" style="s2">things would we be seeing here and what</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.580" end="00:20:31.460" style="s2">kind of um I&#39;ve been thinking recently</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.600" end="00:20:33.200" style="s2">so I keep I keep trying out sticking new</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.460" end="00:20:35.960" style="s2">words in front of design and seeing what</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.200" end="00:20:38.240" style="s2">happens and the main one I&#39;ve been doing</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.960" end="00:20:40.250" style="s2">lately is metaphor design and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.240" end="00:20:43.900" style="s2">been a super powerful intuition pump for</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.250" end="00:20:49.520" style="s2">me like really great um a different</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.900" end="00:20:51.800" style="s2">thing I&#39;ve been thinking about is like</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.520" end="00:20:53.990" style="s2">something like situation design so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.800" end="00:20:57.140" style="s2">like when somebody is looking at this</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.990" end="00:20:59.570" style="s2">list what situation are they in you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.140" end="00:21:03.260" style="s2">one metaphor that we might use for that</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.570" end="00:21:04.310" style="s2">is like a university club&#39;s fair like</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.260" end="00:21:05.900" style="s2">you know during the first week of</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.310" end="00:21:07.340" style="s2">university there&#39;s a bunch of clubs</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.900" end="00:21:10.490" style="s2">right and they&#39;re kind of recruiting</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.340" end="00:21:11.780" style="s2">right so like and to some extent you</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.490" end="00:21:13.160" style="s2">know they&#39;re just recruiting random</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.780" end="00:21:15.770" style="s2">people but to also some extent you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.160" end="00:21:17.270" style="s2">the a cappella club wants singers right</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.770" end="00:21:18.710" style="s2">they want people who want to sing</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.270" end="00:21:20.680" style="s2">right so there&#39;s a kind of like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.710" end="00:21:22.550" style="s2">not just trying to recruit anybody</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.680" end="00:21:24.080" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to recruit you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.550" end="00:21:25.880" style="s2">people who already have a resonance with</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.080" end="00:21:28.280" style="s2">that so it&#39;s like you can think of this</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.880" end="00:21:29.870" style="s2">as kind of like a club sphere or you</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.280" end="00:21:32.000" style="s2">could think of it as kind of like a</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.870" end="00:21:33.590" style="s2">conference like ei global where a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.000" end="00:21:35.390" style="s2">of people come together and they say you</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.590" end="00:21:36.590" style="s2">know I&#39;m working on this project and I</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.390" end="00:21:37.790" style="s2">think it&#39;s really important and here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.590" end="00:21:38.900" style="s2">what I&#39;m doing about it and somebody</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.790" end="00:21:40.310" style="s2">else says I&#39;m working on this project</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.900" end="00:21:41.900" style="s2">and I think it&#39;s really important here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.310" end="00:21:43.700" style="s2">what I&#39;m doing about it and you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.900" end="00:21:45.320" style="s2">other people who aren&#39;t actively working</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.700" end="00:21:47.300" style="s2">on projects kind of go to these talks</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.320" end="00:21:49.580" style="s2">and find out like why why these things</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.300" end="00:21:50.630" style="s2">are important so even just saying that</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.580" end="00:21:52.040" style="s2">right now it&#39;s like I hadn&#39;t thought</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.630" end="00:21:54.260" style="s2">about in advance but saying that right</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.040" end="00:21:59.960" style="s2">now it gets me thinking about like oh</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.260" end="00:22:01.760" style="s2">the you know we&#39;re in here might people</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.960" end="00:22:04.070" style="s2">write about like why they think this</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.760" end="00:22:05.720" style="s2">thing is important for instance right</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.070" end="00:22:07.850" style="s2">like that&#39;s that&#39;s a thing that could be</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.720" end="00:22:11.270" style="s2">added right and so it&#39;s like okay you</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.850" end="00:22:12.680" style="s2">know there could be like there could be</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.270" end="00:22:15.440" style="s2">both like how does this how does this</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.680" end="00:22:17.180" style="s2">particular goal of mine relate to this</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.440" end="00:22:19.310" style="s2">and there&#39;s one thing I really like</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.180" end="00:22:23.450" style="s2">about this which is that you can&#39;t join</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.310" end="00:22:25.940" style="s2">you don&#39;t join a purpose as yourself you</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.450" end="00:22:27.230" style="s2">join it with one of your goals so</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.940" end="00:22:29.870" style="s2">there&#39;s no there&#39;s no way to just be in</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.230" end="00:22:31.370" style="s2">the fan club of a purpose like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.870" end="00:22:33.620" style="s2">no way to just be like yeah I care about</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.370" end="00:22:36.500" style="s2">that you have to say I&#39;m working on that</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.620" end="00:22:38.180" style="s2">with this goal like and that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.500" end="00:22:40.220" style="s2">that I find really delightful like</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.180" end="00:22:41.720" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s no like you know there</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.220" end="00:22:43.450" style="s2">are things I care about collect like</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.720" end="00:22:45.680" style="s2">globally but I don&#39;t have any particular</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.450" end="00:22:47.510" style="s2">goals that I&#39;m working on towards them</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.680" end="00:22:48.980" style="s2">and it&#39;s like okay you know and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.510" end="00:22:50.870" style="s2">there could be another relationship</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.980" end="00:22:52.850" style="s2">that&#39;s something like you know fan or</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.870" end="00:22:54.620" style="s2">subscribe or something like that where</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.850" end="00:22:56.240" style="s2">it&#39;s like I&#39;m curious what people are</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.620" end="00:22:58.730" style="s2">doing towards this I want to be a breast</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.240" end="00:22:59.810" style="s2">of it but I&#39;m not like I&#39;m in a totally</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.730" end="00:23:01.490" style="s2">different category than people who are</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.810" end="00:23:07.630" style="s2">like I&#39;m actively working on this every</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.490" end="00:23:09.500" style="s2">day so I&#39;ve got a question around the I</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.630" end="00:23:11.330" style="s2">think someone mentioned something about</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.500" end="00:23:14.330" style="s2">I&#39;m told you but I&#39;m basically that the</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.330" end="00:23:17.900" style="s2">distinction of of these shared purposes</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.330" end="00:23:21.740" style="s2">and how I a shared purpose might be I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.900" end="00:23:23.600" style="s2">just like collectively understood maybe</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.740" end="00:23:27.830" style="s2">a concrete way of saying it is if you</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.600" end="00:23:29.420" style="s2">name something like climate change and I</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.830" end="00:23:31.160" style="s2">name something climate change it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.420" end="00:23:35.300" style="s2">entirely possible and probably like</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.160" end="00:23:36.680" style="s2">we have very different ideas so what I</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.300" end="00:23:39.440" style="s2">guess maybe like what can you say a bit</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.680" end="00:23:43.490" style="s2">more about like how these addresses that</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.440" end="00:23:45.740" style="s2">or have my yeah so in as much as I&#39;ve in</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.490" end="00:23:47.540" style="s2">as much as I&#39;ve thought about that the</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.740" end="00:23:52.940" style="s2">thought that I had basically went</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.540" end="00:23:54.860" style="s2">something like you know in the same way</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.940" end="00:23:56.470" style="s2">that people find themselves into like</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.860" end="00:23:58.970" style="s2">fine you know there&#39;s a lot of different</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.470" end="00:24:01.490" style="s2">climate change oriented groups on</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.970" end="00:24:03.290" style="s2">Facebook say and so it&#39;s like what</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.490" end="00:24:06.620" style="s2">causes you to be in one versus in</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.290" end="00:24:09.200" style="s2">another and the answer to that might be</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.620" end="00:24:11.240" style="s2">something like you know who else is in</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.200" end="00:24:13.070" style="s2">it what kinds of conversations do they</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.240" end="00:24:15.350" style="s2">have like how do they talk about this</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.070" end="00:24:16.970" style="s2">topic how do they apparently understand</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.350" end="00:24:19.370" style="s2">it and sort of who are the moderators of</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.970" end="00:24:22.160" style="s2">it right and so I was kind of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.370" end="00:24:36.800" style="s2">about like like there&#39;s currently a</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.160" end="00:24:38.510" style="s2">thing where there&#39;s a thing where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.800" end="00:24:40.520" style="s2">like if you view if you view a purpose</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.510" end="00:24:42.410" style="s2">that was created by somebody else rather</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.520" end="00:24:44.330" style="s2">than you that instead of seeing settings</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.410" end="00:24:46.220" style="s2">in the top right here you see something</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.330" end="00:24:48.020" style="s2">like purpose holder and then like the</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.220" end="00:24:49.970" style="s2">name of the person holding it so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.020" end="00:24:53.240" style="s2">a sense in which leg I was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.970" end="00:24:55.670" style="s2">sort of as an initial stab at it to just</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.240" end="00:24:57.560" style="s2">try to say okay who&#39;s a vision of this</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.670" end="00:24:58.880" style="s2">purpose like who&#39;s articulation of what</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.560" end="00:25:00.500" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to do here do i resonate</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.880" end="00:25:03.710" style="s2">with and the idea that there could be</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.500" end="00:25:05.780" style="s2">multiple different versions and i think</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.710" end="00:25:08.150" style="s2">that yeah this is another thing that</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.780" end="00:25:09.950" style="s2">could become quite unwieldy at scale and</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.150" end="00:25:12.200" style="s2">another situation where it might make</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.950" end="00:25:14.480" style="s2">sense to have something like you know a</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.200" end="00:25:16.190" style="s2">list over here i don&#39;t if you guys can</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.480" end="00:25:18.950" style="s2">sort of see my mouse but over here on</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.190" end="00:25:22.250" style="s2">the left or something um actually can</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.950" end="00:25:24.860" style="s2">you see my mouse yeah okay cool so list</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.250" end="00:25:26.240" style="s2">somewhere over here that kind of you</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.860" end="00:25:27.890" style="s2">know says something like related</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.240" end="00:25:30.350" style="s2">purposes or something like that right so</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.890" end="00:25:31.820" style="s2">people could kind of like you know these</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.350" end="00:25:35.480" style="s2">purposes could kind of connect with each</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.820" end="00:25:37.040" style="s2">other themselves but but ya know the</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.480" end="00:25:39.740" style="s2">whole thing is an ontological nightmare</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.040" end="00:25:41.330" style="s2">of course because like purposes and</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.740" end="00:25:44.750" style="s2">goals and so on are not perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.330" end="00:25:47.090" style="s2">hierarchical you know I might</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.750" end="00:25:48.170" style="s2">goal half of which is totally related to</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.090" end="00:25:49.760" style="s2">this purpose and half of which is</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.170" end="00:25:51.860" style="s2">totally related to something else and</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.760" end="00:25:55.070" style="s2">it&#39;s currently pretty hard to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.860" end="00:25:56.600" style="s2">easily connect that here so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.070" end="00:25:58.130" style="s2">that&#39;s a design question that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.600" end="00:25:59.390" style="s2">sitting with like when I launched this</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.130" end="00:26:02.030" style="s2">with the effective altruists one of them</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.390" end="00:26:04.490" style="s2">said well I&#39;ve got this this goal like</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.030" end="00:26:06.440" style="s2">half of it goes to ei coordination but</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.490" end="00:26:08.840" style="s2">half of it is also related to this other</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.440" end="00:26:10.370" style="s2">thing which isn&#39;t know so I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.840" end="00:26:12.170" style="s2">how can you know do I link the goal or</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.370" end="00:26:13.310" style="s2">not like how do I think about that and</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.170" end="00:26:14.900" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s something I don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.310" end="00:26:16.810" style="s2">good answer for so that&#39;s I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.900" end="00:26:18.860" style="s2">another thing we could talk about today</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.810" end="00:26:20.660" style="s2">but I currently have that under</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.860" end="00:26:22.100" style="s2">questions we&#39;re probably not asking</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.660" end="00:26:23.720" style="s2">because it&#39;s like there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.100" end="00:26:25.910" style="s2">necessarily a straightforward answer to</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.720" end="00:26:34.610" style="s2">that given that it&#39;s an ontological</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.910" end="00:26:38.630" style="s2">problem Jess should I ask some more</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.610" end="00:26:40.660" style="s2">questions yeah maybe like one more or</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.630" end="00:26:43.580" style="s2">something and then we&#39;ll have to move on</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.660" end="00:26:45.500" style="s2">okay cool yeah so I kind of I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.580" end="00:26:48.020" style="s2">actually maybe don&#39;t don&#39;t answer them</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.500" end="00:26:50.180" style="s2">Malcolm I&#39;m gonna ask some questions</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.020" end="00:26:52.160" style="s2">that then in our breakout rooms we can</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.180" end="00:26:56.660" style="s2">kind of like maybe make some some</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.160" end="00:26:58.760" style="s2">progress towards so I noticed that in</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.660" end="00:27:00.470" style="s2">your design there&#39;s no sense of really</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.760" end="00:27:04.430" style="s2">being together with the people that are</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.470" end="00:27:06.680" style="s2">in your that are in your shared purpose</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.430" end="00:27:10.070" style="s2">right there&#39;s no presence even though</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.680" end="00:27:11.990" style="s2">you have this Pomodoro working room kind</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.070" end="00:27:15.200" style="s2">of thing that it does have a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.990" end="00:27:21.680" style="s2">being together and there&#39;s not really a</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.200" end="00:27:25.450" style="s2">way of vetting people except by maybe</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.680" end="00:27:28.460" style="s2">sharing the link or not for me</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.450" end="00:27:32.120" style="s2">you know hiring someone is like a way of</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.460" end="00:27:33.980" style="s2">trying to create a shared purpose and</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.120" end="00:27:35.690" style="s2">see how someone can do in a shared</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.980" end="00:27:38.870" style="s2">purpose and see if you can really divide</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.690" end="00:27:41.240" style="s2">up work within a shared purpose and this</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.870" end="00:27:44.810" style="s2">is for me very difficult like I&#39;ve often</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.240" end="00:27:47.570" style="s2">made hires that later I was like oh gosh</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.810" end="00:27:50.170" style="s2">this isn&#39;t working out or whatever and</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.570" end="00:27:53.030" style="s2">so there&#39;s this whole space in between</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.170" end="00:27:55.010" style="s2">just like working randomly under the</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.030" end="00:27:57.600" style="s2">same shared purpose and like deciding</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.010" end="00:27:59.549" style="s2">that you&#39;re a team which is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.600" end="00:28:04.679" style="s2">I don&#39;t know ignored in your design so</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.549" end="00:28:06.590" style="s2">far another area is feedback if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.679" end="00:28:08.549" style="s2">making progress towards the goal</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.590" end="00:28:11.039" style="s2">something that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of missing</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.549" end="00:28:14.210" style="s2">is is whether other people are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.039" end="00:28:17.340" style="s2">like noticing chiming in cheering me on</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.210" end="00:28:19.979" style="s2">whether people respect what my sub goal</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.340" end="00:28:22.169" style="s2">is as part of the you know do people</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.979" end="00:28:23.820" style="s2">like like if I&#39;m Elon Musk and I&#39;m using</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.169" end="00:28:25.830" style="s2">accomplice and I&#39;m trying to work on</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.820" end="00:28:27.960" style="s2">climate change and I ship electric cars</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.830" end="00:28:28.979" style="s2">or whatever probably other people are</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.960" end="00:28:33.119" style="s2">like oh yeah he&#39;s actually really</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.979" end="00:28:34.710" style="s2">helping or at least some of them are but</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.119" end="00:28:36.769" style="s2">you know if I&#39;m if I&#39;m somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.710" end="00:28:38.669" style="s2">people might have a different opinion so</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.769" end="00:28:41.849" style="s2">so there&#39;s like some question about</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.669" end="00:28:43.649" style="s2">feedback and I feel like there&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.849" end="00:28:49.289" style="s2">space of people finding each other</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.649" end="00:28:51.149" style="s2">that&#39;s maybe not explored between just</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.289" end="00:28:53.309" style="s2">sharing the link or making it public or</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.149" end="00:28:54.509" style="s2">whatever like the question about how -</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.309" end="00:28:57.720" style="s2">how would you actually want to find</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.509" end="00:29:01.679" style="s2">people that that you would trust to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.720" end="00:29:04.109" style="s2">pursuing a shared purpose together so I</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.679" end="00:29:06.059" style="s2">just said it four things in like human</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.109" end="00:29:09.989" style="s2">systems terminology I said time together</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.059" end="00:29:12.659" style="s2">feedback loyalty or trust and</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.989" end="00:29:14.549" style="s2">matchmaking are kind of like challenges</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.659" end="00:29:20.460" style="s2">that I see here that might be worth</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.549" end="00:29:22.470" style="s2">exploring and Jess do you want to say</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.460" end="00:29:29.460" style="s2">what the plan is for the breakout rooms</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.470" end="00:29:33.320" style="s2">yeah so Joe is gonna kind of drop some</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.460" end="00:29:37.559" style="s2">very quick knowledge on a structure for</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.320" end="00:29:40.379" style="s2">for the kind of discussions we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.559" end="00:29:42.749" style="s2">have in in breakout rooms but</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.379" end="00:29:45.090" style="s2">essentially what we&#39;re gonna do is send</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.749" end="00:29:49.349" style="s2">to our discussions around a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.090" end="00:29:51.450" style="s2">questions and I think we&#39;re gonna shoe</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.349" end="00:29:54.899" style="s2">inertia we scope that to the questions</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.450" end="00:29:57.749" style="s2">we&#39;re asking today or I think maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.899" end="00:30:00.179" style="s2">look at the doc again yes there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.749" end="00:30:02.849" style="s2">questions we&#39;re asking today and then</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.179" end="00:30:06.799" style="s2">there&#39;s these structural features that I</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.849" end="00:30:09.389" style="s2">that I put in which include I will</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.799" end="00:30:10.830" style="s2">highlight the ones that I just asked</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.389" end="00:30:14.610" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.830" end="00:30:16.470" style="s2">I just got it hmm okay but they&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.610" end="00:30:22.260" style="s2">kind of there in the dock like one of</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.470" end="00:30:24.210" style="s2">them is there yeah yeah so we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.260" end="00:30:26.340" style="s2">highlight those and so maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.210" end="00:30:28.470" style="s2">suggested in your breakout room you</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.340" end="00:30:30.890" style="s2">discuss one of these questions either</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.470" end="00:30:32.700" style="s2">under questions we&#39;re asking today or</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.890" end="00:30:34.230" style="s2">structural features that might be</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.700" end="00:30:36.840" style="s2">relevant so you can just take in your</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.230" end="00:30:42.930" style="s2">group yeah and so then what we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.840" end="00:30:45.990" style="s2">do is well in in that bracket room we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.930" end="00:30:49.040" style="s2">discuss those things I invite you to get</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.990" end="00:30:51.420" style="s2">at least one person to be writing down</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.040" end="00:30:54.030" style="s2">thoughts or response if it come up from</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.420" end="00:30:56.490" style="s2">your breakout group in in the section</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.030" end="00:30:58.560" style="s2">that&#39;s called breakout groups and then</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.490" end="00:31:01.590" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna join back in about ten</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.560" end="00:31:05.060" style="s2">minutes and we&#39;re gonna have kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.590" end="00:31:08.430" style="s2">more freeform discussion about that and</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.060" end="00:31:11.970" style="s2">and present kind of any any thoughts or</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.430" end="00:31:15.720" style="s2">feedback to Malcolm that that arose so</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.970" end="00:31:17.430" style="s2">Jo do you want to explain the totals yes</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.720" end="00:31:18.870" style="s2">this is just a way to have if you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.430" end="00:31:21.420" style="s2">a breakout room with like close friends</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.870" end="00:31:23.700" style="s2">don&#39;t don&#39;t bother to do this but unless</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.420" end="00:31:24.780" style="s2">you kind of don&#39;t trust them but if</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.700" end="00:31:27.030" style="s2">you&#39;re in a breakout room with strangers</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.780" end="00:31:29.550" style="s2">a good way to organize the discussion is</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.030" end="00:31:31.350" style="s2">to talk in a funny way but I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.550" end="00:31:34.980" style="s2">demonstrate right now so if people have</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.350" end="00:31:37.530" style="s2">a question they can make a like a turtle</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.980" end="00:31:40.890" style="s2">II gesture like I am if you if you look</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.530" end="00:31:44.910" style="s2">at my screen so this is like a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.890" end="00:31:47.970" style="s2">swimming tortoise something so if you</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.910" end="00:31:50.580" style="s2">have a question like a curiosity you</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.970" end="00:31:52.440" style="s2">make this shape if you have an idea you</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.580" end="00:31:54.840" style="s2">make this shape this is like a rabbit</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.440" end="00:31:57.030" style="s2">yeah if you have a clarifying question</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.840" end="00:31:58.650" style="s2">or something that&#39;s like just a point of</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.030" end="00:32:00.710" style="s2">order like we only have 30 seconds left</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.650" end="00:32:02.910" style="s2">or something you make a kind of a fungus</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.710" end="00:32:04.830" style="s2">rhizome kind of like little dance with</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.910" end="00:32:07.200" style="s2">your fingers so there&#39;s these three ways</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.830" end="00:32:10.800" style="s2">that you kind of like gesture as</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.200" end="00:32:12.960" style="s2">starting your your contribution and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.800" end="00:32:16.920" style="s2">the deal is that they the turtles rule</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.960" end="00:32:19.260" style="s2">so like if you make this the people who</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.920" end="00:32:22.680" style="s2">make the turtle thing the ideas are in</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.260" end="00:32:23.850" style="s2">surface to them so this keeps us from</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.680" end="00:32:26.370" style="s2">just like shouting out</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.850" end="00:32:29.309" style="s2">our ideas and keeps us kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.370" end="00:32:31.440" style="s2">focusing as a group on curiosity rather</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.309" end="00:32:32.100" style="s2">than like oh my dear oh my dear oh my</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.440" end="00:32:34.620" style="s2">dear</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.100" end="00:32:42.419" style="s2">because the turtles are in charge of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.620" end="00:32:46.530" style="s2">room so and if you have any questions</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.419" end="00:32:49.320" style="s2">about that you can I think you should be</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.530" end="00:32:51.360" style="s2">able to chat back at us from out from in</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.320" end="00:32:53.330" style="s2">your your breakout room so if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.360" end="00:32:57.570" style="s2">like I&#39;m lost or I don&#39;t understand then</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.330" end="00:33:01.220" style="s2">then chat and myself or joke so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.570" end="00:33:07.380" style="s2">gonna start the breakout rooms now and</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.220" end="00:33:08.039" style="s2">we&#39;ll be back in about ten minutes it</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.380" end="00:33:10.830" style="s2">was good</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.039" end="00:33:12.870" style="s2">our group is good okay cool well does</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.830" end="00:33:17.240" style="s2">someone in there I want to give us a bit</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.870" end="00:33:21.780" style="s2">of wisdom back what you all talked about</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.240" end="00:33:27.350" style="s2">that&#39;s the question or something I&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.780" end="00:33:31.080" style="s2">happy to okay does that make sense yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.350" end="00:33:35.450" style="s2">is everybody back in yet uh I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.080" end="00:33:39.600" style="s2">we&#39;re approaching most people being back</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.450" end="00:33:41.000" style="s2">cool okay so yeah our group discussion</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.600" end="00:33:43.200" style="s2">was really rich for such a short</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.000" end="00:33:48.059" style="s2">discussion between people who didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.200" end="00:33:49.049" style="s2">know each other we explored a few</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.059" end="00:33:52.500" style="s2">different directions</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.049" end="00:33:54.539" style="s2">the main one was we looked at taking we</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.500" end="00:33:55.919" style="s2">we looked at how to divide up people who</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.539" end="00:33:58.380" style="s2">care about the same goal like climate</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.919" end="00:34:00.480" style="s2">change or something like that in two</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.380" end="00:34:02.789" style="s2">different theories of change so one idea</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.480" end="00:34:04.860" style="s2">was to separate like have some</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.789" end="00:34:06.419" style="s2">discussions sections underneath the</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.860" end="00:34:08.280" style="s2">shared purpose like the climate change</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.419" end="00:34:10.560" style="s2">shared purpose with some like why</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.280" end="00:34:12.450" style="s2">discussion that we see thought would be</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.560" end="00:34:15.119" style="s2">pretty easy and then somehow discussion</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.450" end="00:34:18.859" style="s2">that would be very there would be a lot</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.119" end="00:34:21.810" style="s2">of disagreements and we thought about</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.859" end="00:34:23.460" style="s2">how people in the house section could</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.810" end="00:34:26.820" style="s2">find people who have similar theories of</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.460" end="00:34:28.619" style="s2">change or shared context so we talked</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.820" end="00:34:31.230" style="s2">about like maybe they could find people</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.619" end="00:34:36.089" style="s2">who agreed with same podcasts or social</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.230" end="00:34:37.679" style="s2">theories or yes they could somehow like</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.089" end="00:34:39.389" style="s2">aggregate around like</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.679" end="00:34:41.550" style="s2">not only am i working on climate change</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.389" end="00:34:44.369" style="s2">but I follow this social theory or at</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.550" end="00:34:47.010" style="s2">this view</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.369" end="00:34:49.230" style="s2">Michael Shellenberger or whatever you</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.010" end="00:34:51.059" style="s2">know we also looked at so this started</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.230" end="00:34:53.280" style="s2">to create a kind of a funny mix of a</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.059" end="00:34:55.470" style="s2">social network that was about work and</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.280" end="00:34:57.300" style="s2">also a social network that was more</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.470" end="00:34:59.790" style="s2">about like different kinds of theories</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.300" end="00:35:01.650" style="s2">and ideological positions on that work</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.790" end="00:35:03.510" style="s2">which I thought was quite beautiful and</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.650" end="00:35:05.579" style="s2">then we also talked very briefly about a</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.510" end="00:35:08.040" style="s2">payments Network like a patreon model</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.579" end="00:35:09.599" style="s2">where you support other people who are</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.040" end="00:35:13.170" style="s2">working to the same for the same goals</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.599" end="00:35:15.480" style="s2">yeah cool to someone from the Dussehra</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.170" end="00:35:18.540" style="s2">Malcom James Nathan Tanya group that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.480" end="00:35:23.250" style="s2">maybe not Malcolm want to just give like</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.540" end="00:35:26.099" style="s2">maybe one question you were asking that</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.250" end="00:35:29.130" style="s2">was particularly interesting or one kind</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.099" end="00:35:36.599" style="s2">of consideration that you had that came</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.130" end="00:35:40.530" style="s2">up one question you&#39;re asking is for all</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.599" end="00:35:43.260" style="s2">of the different features this would</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.530" end="00:35:44.970" style="s2">need to be like a whole organism like</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.260" end="00:35:46.650" style="s2">does it want to have those inside it or</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.970" end="00:35:50.660" style="s2">does it want to connect to something</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.650" end="00:36:04.170" style="s2">outside an interface that has those</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.660" end="00:36:05.880" style="s2">capabilities I guess like concretely</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.170" end="00:36:09.049" style="s2">like it could link to a discord server</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.880" end="00:36:13.920" style="s2">for instance like oh we talk over here</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.049" end="00:36:16.410" style="s2">okay I&#39;m just kind of jumping through</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.920" end="00:36:18.809" style="s2">people because we have I showed amount</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.410" end="00:36:20.460" style="s2">of time with the the Phil Dave Bulow of</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.809" end="00:36:22.740" style="s2">the Brawn group does someone want to</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.460" end="00:36:25.579" style="s2">kind of also offer a reflection and</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.740" end="00:36:30.020" style="s2">maybe questions or something that you</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.579" end="00:36:30.020" style="s2">were curious about during that time</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.040" end="00:36:38.220" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.460" end="00:36:40.410" style="s2">one okay</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.220" end="00:36:43.410" style="s2">I guess one of the well we had we had a</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.410" end="00:36:45.390" style="s2">lot of interesting discussion and some</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.410" end="00:36:47.460" style="s2">questions some of the questions that</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.390" end="00:36:49.230" style="s2">popped up I wish we had more time to</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.460" end="00:36:52.080" style="s2">discuss aviv mentioned this idea of like</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.230" end="00:36:54.350" style="s2">tools versus actions phil was talking</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.080" end="00:36:57.840" style="s2">about the the what versus the how and</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.350" end="00:37:00.180" style="s2">the thing that i remember discussing at</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.840" end="00:37:02.460" style="s2">the end was how a goal is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.180" end="00:37:04.230" style="s2">amorphous and and could be really really</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.460" end="00:37:06.530" style="s2">big and how at the very very bottom</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.230" end="00:37:10.250" style="s2">there&#39;s just an individual with a single</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.530" end="00:37:13.920" style="s2">intention or goal that might match and</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.250" end="00:37:16.050" style="s2">if there was a tearing process and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.920" end="00:37:17.280" style="s2">a goal holder like the SDGs actually has</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.050" end="00:37:19.620" style="s2">people i don&#39;t know what they&#39;re called</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.280" end="00:37:20.910" style="s2">exactly but they&#39;re like goal owners and</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.620" end="00:37:23.250" style="s2">they kind of own a goal and they try to</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.910" end="00:37:25.170" style="s2">make stuff happen around this particular</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.250" end="00:37:27.150" style="s2">thing and it was just this idea of like</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.170" end="00:37:28.380" style="s2">how is that tearing happening and how is</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.150" end="00:37:29.970" style="s2">that coordinating happening why there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.380" end="00:37:31.800" style="s2">like very very small actions and very</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.970" end="00:37:33.330" style="s2">very huge i&#39;d say like maybe there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.800" end="00:37:36.740" style="s2">something called a vision like is there</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.330" end="00:37:43.620" style="s2">any more levels that need to be created</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.740" end="00:37:46.980" style="s2">okay um maybe Benjamin Nick Elliott and</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.620" end="00:37:49.380" style="s2">starfish group if you want to if someone</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.980" end="00:37:53.720" style="s2">wants to offer something from your your</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.380" end="00:37:53.720" style="s2">group a question or a consideration</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.040" end="00:38:02.460" style="s2">um something that starfish brought up</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.260" end="00:38:05.310" style="s2">that I thought was really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.460" end="00:38:07.260" style="s2">and it&#39;s interesting is that um the</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.310" end="00:38:10.890" style="s2">accomplice seems like it could help with</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.260" end="00:38:12.480" style="s2">like decentralized power in projects</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.890" end="00:38:14.339" style="s2">where people are working together but</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.480" end="00:38:16.680" style="s2">that they&#39;re too sort of different ways</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.339" end="00:38:19.290" style="s2">so things can be decentralized either</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.680" end="00:38:21.030" style="s2">there can be a core community with no</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.290" end="00:38:22.710" style="s2">real leader but everybody is like</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.030" end="00:38:25.260" style="s2">committed and working on the project and</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.710" end="00:38:27.270" style="s2">the boundary is such that people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.260" end="00:38:30.300" style="s2">just pop in and out or there can be a</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.270" end="00:38:32.819" style="s2">more open source style decentralized set</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.300" end="00:38:34.650" style="s2">up where people are just able to drop in</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.819" end="00:38:36.210" style="s2">and out as they please and there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.650" end="00:38:39.089" style="s2">centralized authority in that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.210" end="00:38:41.000" style="s2">nature and I think most of our</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.089" end="00:38:45.750" style="s2">discussion just centered around how</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.000" end="00:38:48.119" style="s2">depending on which kinds of purposes you</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.750" end="00:38:50.040" style="s2">had behind having shared purposes in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.119" end="00:38:52.490" style="s2">first place you might use comp lists in</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.040" end="00:38:52.490" style="s2">different ways</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.180" end="00:39:02.220" style="s2">awesome and also if you guys have</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.420" end="00:39:04.440" style="s2">comments on the notes of any other group</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.220" end="00:39:07.740" style="s2">feel free to add like a comment in</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.440" end="00:39:09.240" style="s2">Google Docs on there and you can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.740" end="00:39:10.920" style="s2">continue that conversation so if you</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.240" end="00:39:13.410" style="s2">have a response that you we don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.920" end="00:39:15.960" style="s2">necessarily enough time to respond to in</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.410" end="00:39:19.250" style="s2">person right now yeah you can add a</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.960" end="00:39:26.060" style="s2">comment directly on there that groups</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.250" end="00:39:30.450" style="s2">reflection in the doc so a 5-second yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.060" end="00:39:31.740" style="s2">something that came up that I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.450" end="00:39:32.849" style="s2">thought would be interesting was it when</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.740" end="00:39:36.359" style="s2">you have this kind of overall</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.849" end="00:39:38.310" style="s2">overarching goals and be able to put in</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.359" end="00:39:39.690" style="s2">an individual one if there may be a slot</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.310" end="00:39:41.190" style="s2">but people who could put in where</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.690" end="00:39:43.320" style="s2">there&#39;s gaps like I see this giant</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.190" end="00:39:44.460" style="s2">project coming about and I see that</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.320" end="00:39:45.780" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of people are not easement</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.460" end="00:39:47.520" style="s2">projects and say there&#39;s room for this</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.780" end="00:39:49.470" style="s2">project but I once called it out maybe</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.520" end="00:39:51.900" style="s2">kind of having an alert and then that</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.470" end="00:39:53.220" style="s2">can match up if people who already have</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.900" end="00:39:55.770" style="s2">that written down as one of their own</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.220" end="00:39:57.240" style="s2">personal goals or people who want to</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.770" end="00:39:59.490" style="s2">take on a new goal and they see this</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.240" end="00:40:04.970" style="s2">huge project and I&#39;d see a whole gap</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.490" end="00:40:07.980" style="s2">here yeah cool thanks all right</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.970" end="00:40:10.109" style="s2">and Sebastian Nicolas and Robin if</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.980" end="00:40:15.359" style="s2">someone from that group wants to offer a</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.109" end="00:40:16.680" style="s2">question or an inflexion this is the</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.359" end="00:40:24.810" style="s2">moment where we would all stare at each</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.680" end="00:40:26.070" style="s2">other if we could so I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.810" end="00:40:27.900" style="s2">that I found really interesting was this</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.070" end="00:40:29.220" style="s2">you took some time to kind of resolve</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.900" end="00:40:31.740" style="s2">whether this is about working on</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.220" end="00:40:34.410" style="s2">something together quite concretely or</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.740" end="00:40:36.119" style="s2">about having a sense of like sharing the</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.410" end="00:40:37.680" style="s2">same forest those people you can&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.119" end="00:40:40.080" style="s2">because they walk in different paths of</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.680" end="00:40:42.000" style="s2">it&#39;s different part of it and how that</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.080" end="00:40:43.410" style="s2">might influence how you you would want</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.000" end="00:40:44.790" style="s2">to design around the difference more</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.410" end="00:40:46.650" style="s2">about like the sense of sharing</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.790" end="00:40:53.730" style="s2">something or the actual practicality of</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.650" end="00:40:55.980" style="s2">doing together anything else yeah we</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.730" end="00:40:57.800" style="s2">also talked about kind of some of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.980" end="00:41:00.150" style="s2">main issues that might come up are</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.800" end="00:41:04.109" style="s2">similar to in other groups like how do</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.150" end="00:41:06.330" style="s2">you have how do you for the people who</p>

<p begin="00:41:42.480" end="00:41:46.080" style="s2">do something about that maybe you could</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.950" end="00:41:48.300" style="s2">work together so how could we offline</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.080" end="00:41:50.520" style="s2">this from online to offline like how</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.300" end="00:41:52.050" style="s2">does that move and then how do you have</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.520" end="00:41:54.120" style="s2">enough difference in your group that</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.050" end="00:41:55.710" style="s2">it&#39;s not just an echo chamber we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.120" end="00:41:58.350" style="s2">really touch that one but that&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.710" end="00:42:02.300" style="s2">gonna be kind of an issue with any group</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.350" end="00:42:02.300" style="s2">that forms and so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.579" end="00:42:07.840" style="s2">you</p>

<p begin="00:42:18.310" end="00:42:24.190" style="s2">mean I think we just sort of begun to</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.470" end="00:42:25.630" style="s2">dive into a huge design space that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.190" end="00:42:28.920" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.630" end="00:42:31.690" style="s2">I think Malcolm maybe just with like</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.920" end="00:42:32.770" style="s2">like from all the way up to all the way</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.690" end="00:42:36.760" style="s2">down do you feel like this just like</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.770" end="00:42:38.620" style="s2">helpful investigation I&#39;m not sure I</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.760" end="00:42:41.080" style="s2">could summarize it like with it with an</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.620" end="00:42:42.820" style="s2">upper it down it has helped me think</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.080" end="00:42:44.890" style="s2">about this a lot but it&#39;s one of those</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.820" end="00:42:46.360" style="s2">situations where like you think you have</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.890" end="00:42:47.770" style="s2">like something that&#39;s like almost done</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.360" end="00:42:49.540" style="s2">and then you like think about it more</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.770" end="00:42:50.530" style="s2">and then you&#39;re like oh my god there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.540" end="00:42:54.310" style="s2">so much left to do</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.530" end="00:42:55.930" style="s2">so so I feel less close to done than</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.310" end="00:42:58.690" style="s2">when I came but that&#39;s not because I</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.930" end="00:43:00.280" style="s2">have more completely less information or</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.690" end="00:43:02.140" style="s2">something yeah I feel like I got a lot</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.280" end="00:43:04.150" style="s2">out of this I&#39;d love if people like</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.140" end="00:43:06.640" style="s2">recorded their breakout groups which I</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.150" end="00:43:08.140" style="s2">assume nobody did but like I would love</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.640" end="00:43:10.330" style="s2">to just like listen to each of them and</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.140" end="00:43:11.350" style="s2">be like why do people talk about um so</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.330" end="00:43:12.820" style="s2">I&#39;m just something like thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.350" end="00:43:14.350" style="s2">that as part of the design of future</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.820" end="00:43:15.460" style="s2">iterations of social design clubs or</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.350" end="00:43:17.290" style="s2">something like that because it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.460" end="00:43:18.880" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m looking at all these notes here</p>

<p begin="00:44:49.579" end="00:44:55.779" style="s2">ahead of us not just to redesign</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.180" end="00:45:01.309" style="s2">accomplice but like all the other stuff</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.779" end="00:45:03.259" style="s2">and and I would like to try to scale in</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.309" end="00:45:04.729" style="s2">that direction so if you think of a</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.259" end="00:45:05.720" style="s2">social design not necessarily something</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.729" end="00:45:07.220" style="s2">that you&#39;re working on even but</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.720" end="00:45:09.970" style="s2">something that&#39;s really frustrating for</p>

<p begin="00:45:14.329" end="00:45:18.589" style="s2">and you think about who would be the</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.400" end="00:45:22.069" style="s2">ideal people to do that redesign with</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.589" end="00:45:25.190" style="s2">and how can can you bring them here and</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.069" end="00:45:27.410" style="s2">how can we like make this thing grow in</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.190" end="00:45:32.989" style="s2">capacity so that we can help each other</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.410" end="00:45:34.880" style="s2">do this stuff I think that&#39;s it thank</p>
