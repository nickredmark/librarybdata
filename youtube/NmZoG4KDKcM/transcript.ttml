<p begin="00:00:08.390" end="00:00:13.769" style="s2">hey everyone this is an interview with</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.860" end="00:00:16.290" style="s2">Thomas Bjorkman Thomas is a Swedish</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.769" end="00:00:18.030" style="s2">businessman entrepreneur and philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.290" end="00:00:20.790" style="s2">so Thomas recently released a book</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.030" end="00:00:23.130" style="s2">called the Nordic secret looking at how</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.790" end="00:00:26.550" style="s2">the Scandinavian countries went from</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.130" end="00:00:27.900" style="s2">being the poorest in Europe the turn of</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.550" end="00:00:29.970" style="s2">the century to being some of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.900" end="00:00:31.770" style="s2">wealthiest and happiest at the end of</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.970" end="00:00:34.260" style="s2">the century and he found that they</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.770" end="00:00:36.690" style="s2">basically instituted a system of folk</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.260" end="00:00:38.820" style="s2">high schools that a large proportion of</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.690" end="00:00:40.500" style="s2">the population went to and what they</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.820" end="00:00:42.900" style="s2">taught was effectively self-development</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.500" end="00:00:44.250" style="s2">creating an inner compass and Thomas&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.900" end="00:00:46.890" style="s2">perspective is that something like that</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.250" end="00:00:48.840" style="s2">is desperately needed right now to deal</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.890" end="00:00:50.370" style="s2">with the pace of change but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.840" end="00:00:52.260" style="s2">more information we need it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.370" end="00:00:54.420" style="s2">ability to navigate and more ability to</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.260" end="00:00:56.550" style="s2">steer in this strange new world</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.420" end="00:00:59.070" style="s2">so Thomas we&#39;ve known each other quite a</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.550" end="00:01:01.440" style="s2">long time you&#39;re a philosopher and</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.070" end="00:01:04.470" style="s2">social entrepreneur we share a real</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.440" end="00:01:07.289" style="s2">interest and passion for developmental</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.470" end="00:01:09.479" style="s2">thinking systems change and also kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.289" end="00:01:11.420" style="s2">the deep stories of society you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.479" end="00:01:14.429" style="s2">written about those in various books</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.420" end="00:01:16.259" style="s2">including the world we create and for</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.429" end="00:01:19.619" style="s2">full transparency you were also an early</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.259" end="00:01:22.369" style="s2">investor in rebel wisdom and you wrote a</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.619" end="00:01:25.020" style="s2">book about building and how that</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.369" end="00:01:28.350" style="s2">transformed the Scandinavian Society I</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.020" end="00:01:29.939" style="s2">think it&#39;s worth just recapping the the</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.350" end="00:01:33.469" style="s2">basics of that cuz I think it&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.939" end="00:01:36.359" style="s2">great model for understanding how</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.469" end="00:01:38.009" style="s2">different people have gone through these</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.359" end="00:01:40.859" style="s2">major transitions in the past and</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.009" end="00:01:45.179" style="s2">actually thrived as a result of it so</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.859" end="00:01:48.840" style="s2">the book that I&#39;ve written together with</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.179" end="00:01:53.039" style="s2">my friend and colleague yeah the Danish</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.840" end="00:01:55.709" style="s2">philosopher and writer Liana Anderson is</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.039" end="00:01:57.679" style="s2">called the Nordic secret what we are</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.709" end="00:02:01.590" style="s2">trying to uncover in the book is</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.679" end="00:02:04.880" style="s2">political and and history of ideas of</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.590" end="00:02:07.979" style="s2">the Scandinavian countries that is not</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.880" end="00:02:10.300" style="s2">generally very well known not not even</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.979" end="00:02:12.410" style="s2">in in Scandinavia and</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.300" end="00:02:18.650" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.410" end="00:02:20.500" style="s2">it&#39;s all about the fact that I think we</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.650" end="00:02:25.070" style="s2">could say that the Nordic countries</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.500" end="00:02:28.280" style="s2">manage this transition from a pre-modern</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.070" end="00:02:35.510" style="s2">society into modernity better than any</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.280" end="00:02:38.360" style="s2">other societies we know of now I&#39;m the</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.510" end="00:02:40.760" style="s2">first one to say that we are loosing a</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.360" end="00:02:42.080" style="s2">little bit of this but what we did a</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.760" end="00:02:44.630" style="s2">hundred years ago was actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.080" end="00:02:47.420" style="s2">astonishing because at the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.630" end="00:02:52.270" style="s2">1800s all the Nordic countries were</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.420" end="00:02:56.480" style="s2">amongst the the poorest non democratic</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.270" end="00:03:00.620" style="s2">agrarian societies in Europe at the end</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.480" end="00:03:03.220" style="s2">of the 1800s 30% of the working</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.620" end="00:03:07.670" style="s2">population in Sweden for example</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.220" end="00:03:10.190" style="s2">emigrated mainly to the US because of</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.670" end="00:03:15.920" style="s2">terrible living conditions people were</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.190" end="00:03:19.880" style="s2">just like in Island at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.920" end="00:03:22.730" style="s2">where were starving and then just a few</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.880" end="00:03:25.370" style="s2">generations later all the Nordic</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.730" end="00:03:29.170" style="s2">countries were at the top of the list of</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.370" end="00:03:33.320" style="s2">the richest the happiest most stable</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.170" end="00:03:38.120" style="s2">industrial democracies and the question</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.320" end="00:03:40.010" style="s2">is what facilitated that transition and</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.120" end="00:03:42.650" style="s2">of course there are many reasons for</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.010" end="00:03:46.280" style="s2">that but one reason that has been mainly</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.650" end="00:03:50.360" style="s2">forgotten in in history is the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.280" end="00:03:53.780" style="s2">we had very visionary intellectuals and</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.360" end="00:03:58.010" style="s2">politicians in all the Nordic countries</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.780" end="00:04:01.700" style="s2">back then and they actually knew that in</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.010" end="00:04:04.700" style="s2">times of rapid societal change and they</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.700" end="00:04:08.420" style="s2">saw both industrialization and</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.700" end="00:04:10.430" style="s2">urbanization coming so they knew that we</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.420" end="00:04:12.950" style="s2">would have to prepare for rapid social</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.430" end="00:04:15.890" style="s2">change so in these times of turbulence</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.950" end="00:04:19.280" style="s2">it&#39;s just so natural for us humans to</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.890" end="00:04:20.880" style="s2">want to have an outside authority to</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.280" end="00:04:24.060" style="s2">hold on to</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.880" end="00:04:27.090" style="s2">that could be a dogmatic religion or an</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.060" end="00:04:28.890" style="s2">authoritarian leader but these</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.090" end="00:04:33.530" style="s2">intellectuals at least in Sweden were</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.890" end="00:04:37.610" style="s2">men mainly non-religious even atheistic</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.530" end="00:04:40.350" style="s2">and they certainly did not want to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.610" end="00:04:43.500" style="s2">authoritarian leaders they were firmly</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.350" end="00:04:44.970" style="s2">committed to build democracy and they</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.500" end="00:04:47.990" style="s2">knew that the only way to build</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.970" end="00:04:51.930" style="s2">democracy was to build it from bottom up</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.990" end="00:04:54.450" style="s2">so with today&#39;s language we could say</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.930" end="00:04:58.860" style="s2">that what they wanted to do was that</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.450" end="00:05:01.800" style="s2">they wanted to facilitate for enough</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.860" end="00:05:06.570" style="s2">many people in the population</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.800" end="00:05:09.900" style="s2">to create a critical mass of conscious</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.570" end="00:05:12.750" style="s2">co-creators of modernity that actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.900" end="00:05:16.160" style="s2">had come that far on their own inner</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.750" end="00:05:19.700" style="s2">personal development that they have gone</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.160" end="00:05:22.530" style="s2">from the state that we would today call</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.700" end="00:05:25.080" style="s2">that we are operating from a socialized</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.530" end="00:05:29.010" style="s2">mind where we are mainly dependent on</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.080" end="00:05:32.450" style="s2">outside confirmation and guidance for</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.010" end="00:05:37.260" style="s2">our for our values and direction to</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.450" end="00:05:41.070" style="s2">actually internalize our values and find</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.260" end="00:05:43.800" style="s2">our inner compass and be grounded enough</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.070" end="00:05:46.770" style="s2">in ourselves not to be dependent on</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.800" end="00:05:48.900" style="s2">outside Authority today we would say</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.770" end="00:05:51.570" style="s2">that that is the shift in professor</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.900" end="00:05:54.240" style="s2">Robert Kagan&#39;s language from a</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.570" end="00:05:57.390" style="s2">socialized mind to a self authoring mind</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.240" end="00:06:00.090" style="s2">and how they did this is quite</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.390" end="00:06:03.270" style="s2">extraordinary so what they actually did</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.090" end="00:06:05.760" style="s2">was that they created what perhaps could</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.270" end="00:06:08.580" style="s2">best today be described as retreat</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.760" end="00:06:12.360" style="s2">centers and they did this all over</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.580" end="00:06:16.320" style="s2">Scandinavia and on a massive scale so at</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.360" end="00:06:19.190" style="s2">the end of the 1800s year 1900 there</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.320" end="00:06:22.790" style="s2">were a hundred retreat centers</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.190" end="00:06:26.490" style="s2">established in Denmark alone</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.790" end="00:06:30.660" style="s2">seventy-five in Norway and a hundred and</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.490" end="00:06:33.750" style="s2">fifty in Sweden where young adults in</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.660" end="00:06:34.710" style="s2">their early twenties later on with full</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.750" end="00:06:40.170" style="s2">state such</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.710" end="00:06:45.150" style="s2">I could spend six months in retreat with</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.170" end="00:06:49.410" style="s2">the main aim of developing this self</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.150" end="00:06:52.200" style="s2">authoring capacity to be able to become</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.410" end="00:06:55.230" style="s2">conscious co-creators of modality and</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.200" end="00:06:59.880" style="s2">when this was at its height almost</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.230" end="00:07:02.280" style="s2">exactly 100 years ago then actually 10%</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.880" end="00:07:05.280" style="s2">of each young generation had the</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.280" end="00:07:09.660" style="s2">possibility to participate in in one of</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.280" end="00:07:12.690" style="s2">these half year-long retreats and of</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.660" end="00:07:16.530" style="s2">course that created some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.690" end="00:07:19.770" style="s2">critical mass especially since these 10%</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.530" end="00:07:23.720" style="s2">were not just sort of located in some</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.770" end="00:07:27.930" style="s2">small elite in society in its own bubble</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.720" end="00:07:33.660" style="s2">these 10% came from all different walks</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.930" end="00:07:36.210" style="s2">of life many middle middle class but the</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.660" end="00:07:40.440" style="s2">majority of the participants were</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.210" end="00:07:43.890" style="s2">actually working class or had a farming</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.440" end="00:07:48.450" style="s2">background and what sort of things were</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.890" end="00:07:50.580" style="s2">they learning so and the thing about</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.450" end="00:07:53.130" style="s2">personal development and you have</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.580" end="00:07:55.680" style="s2">yourself David spoken many times on on</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.130" end="00:07:58.590" style="s2">this channel about personal development</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.680" end="00:08:00.630" style="s2">and how you cannot really learn personal</p>

<p begin="00:08:20.670" end="00:08:25.520" style="s2">something like that and you really have</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.680" end="00:08:31.950" style="s2">a need to start to to question your</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.520" end="00:08:35.610" style="s2">fundamental assumptions so what they did</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.950" end="00:08:38.790" style="s2">there was not so much learning it was</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.610" end="00:08:42.000" style="s2">more trying to give the participants an</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.790" end="00:08:44.550" style="s2">embodied experience so they&#39;re these</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.000" end="00:08:48.020" style="s2">centers they were called fault high</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.550" end="00:08:51.110" style="s2">schools they were</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.020" end="00:08:54.470" style="s2">fairly small they had a living community</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.110" end="00:08:58.279" style="s2">of about 40 50 60 participants were</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.470" end="00:09:03.160" style="s2">often out in nature there was a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.279" end="00:09:06.080" style="s2">reading was a lot of singing a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.160" end="00:09:09.260" style="s2">experiencing nature but perhaps the most</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.080" end="00:09:11.450" style="s2">important part was to create a safe</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.260" end="00:09:14.810" style="s2">environment where you could actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.450" end="00:09:19.279" style="s2">have authentic discussions about</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.810" end="00:09:21.920" style="s2">anything in in in life so that that was</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.279" end="00:09:24.980" style="s2">really the the methodology and I guess</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.920" end="00:09:27.399" style="s2">that is not so different from what we</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.980" end="00:09:30.260" style="s2">are doing today a personal development</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.399" end="00:09:32.440" style="s2">retreats even if we do not today have</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.260" end="00:09:36.410" style="s2">the luxury usually to be able to spend</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.440" end="00:09:39.770" style="s2">six months in retreat it&#39;s always about</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.410" end="00:09:43.120" style="s2">creating this sort of safe environment</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.770" end="00:09:47.420" style="s2">where you can actually open up but then</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.120" end="00:09:50.899" style="s2">get enough challenge of your your hidden</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.420" end="00:09:54.589" style="s2">assumptions your root metaphors what you</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.899" end="00:09:58.220" style="s2">take for granted to really start some</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.589" end="00:10:00.770" style="s2">sort of on inner shift I should say say</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.220" end="00:10:03.320" style="s2">that even though the focus and the aim</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.770" end="00:10:07.360" style="s2">was on inner development there was also</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.320" end="00:10:12.140" style="s2">a bit of learning so at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.360" end="00:10:14.560" style="s2">you did learn about new technology so</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.140" end="00:10:17.839" style="s2">that you should be able to embrace</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.560" end="00:10:21.260" style="s2">modernity as it was coming and know that</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.839" end="00:10:23.060" style="s2">we as humans can actually use technology</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.260" end="00:10:24.829" style="s2">for good and bad and that we shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.060" end="00:10:29.360" style="s2">be afraid of technology but rather than</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.829" end="00:10:31.339" style="s2">brace technology and also they the</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.360" end="00:10:34.760" style="s2">participants were given the basic tools</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.339" end="00:10:38.510" style="s2">for organizing civil society to you you</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.760" end="00:10:43.660" style="s2">learned how to write an article perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.510" end="00:10:46.820" style="s2">even how to start a small civil society</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.660" end="00:10:50.779" style="s2">organization how to give a speech and</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.820" end="00:10:52.880" style="s2">and things like that so if we would do</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.779" end="00:10:54.470" style="s2">the same thing today it would be</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.880" end="00:10:56.440" style="s2">personal development it would be</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.470" end="00:10:59.990" style="s2">learning about artificial intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.440" end="00:11:01.400" style="s2">and automation and social media and</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.990" end="00:11:03.550" style="s2">things like that</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.400" end="00:11:09.380" style="s2">it would also mean how do you do a</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.550" end="00:11:13.340" style="s2">YouTube video how to argue for your case</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.380" end="00:11:16.460" style="s2">and how do you make a video go viral on</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.340" end="00:11:20.410" style="s2">social media and things like yeah like</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.460" end="00:11:26.810" style="s2">that so it was really a broad and deep</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.410" end="00:11:29.600" style="s2">program and one one thing of course one</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.810" end="00:11:33.170" style="s2">could ask is so where did the these</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.600" end="00:11:37.040" style="s2">ideas come from and the interesting</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.170" end="00:11:40.820" style="s2">thing is that these ideas came from the</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.040" end="00:11:42.920" style="s2">German idealist philosophers that wrote</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.820" end="00:11:47.810" style="s2">in the beginning of the 1800s</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.920" end="00:11:52.100" style="s2">so philosophers like gift Schiller</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.810" end="00:11:55.190" style="s2">Hera de from Humboldt Hegel these</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.100" end="00:11:58.040" style="s2">philosophers were all read in in German</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.190" end="00:12:00.290" style="s2">original by by the intellectuals in</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.040" end="00:12:02.720" style="s2">Sweden because back then German rostov</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.290" end="00:12:05.810" style="s2">was the first foreign language and and</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.720" end="00:12:09.620" style="s2">the academic language and of course</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.810" end="00:12:12.560" style="s2">these philosophers they all reacted</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.620" end="00:12:16.120" style="s2">against the enlightenment philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.560" end="00:12:19.010" style="s2">view of our mind as a rational machine</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.120" end="00:12:22.400" style="s2">so they said that no our mind is not a</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.010" end="00:12:27.560" style="s2">rational machine or our mind is actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.400" end="00:12:30.170" style="s2">a organic developing system and it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.560" end="00:12:32.870" style="s2">the mind is not just located in in our</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.170" end="00:12:35.720" style="s2">brain our mind is embodied in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.870" end="00:12:39.350" style="s2">totality of our bodies and embedded in</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.720" end="00:12:42.400" style="s2">societal culture and under the</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.350" end="00:12:45.590" style="s2">development throughout life and this</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.400" end="00:12:50.150" style="s2">developmental process they gave the</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.590" end="00:12:53.380" style="s2">German name building and they were quite</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.150" end="00:12:59.240" style="s2">specific on how one could facilitate</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.380" end="00:13:01.850" style="s2">this building process and the steps of</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.240" end="00:13:05.120" style="s2">consciousness development that for</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.850" end="00:13:08.510" style="s2">example Schiller and get wrote</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.120" end="00:13:12.620" style="s2">explicitly about is very very similar to</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.510" end="00:13:14.930" style="s2">what developmental psychologists today</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.620" end="00:13:18.350" style="s2">at Harvard University and other places</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.930" end="00:13:21.200" style="s2">our finding empirically that we as</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.350" end="00:13:23.350" style="s2">humans are capable of going through</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.200" end="00:13:26.570" style="s2">given they&#39;re in the right an</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.350" end="00:13:28.640" style="s2">environment so one could say that the</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.570" end="00:13:33.560" style="s2">the Nordic countries were were really</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.640" end="00:13:36.290" style="s2">ahead of of all the time a hundred years</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.560" end="00:13:38.540" style="s2">ago but as I said we are losing it a bit</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.290" end="00:13:40.279" style="s2">now and we have actually in all this can</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.540" end="00:13:43.160" style="s2">maybe in countries completely forgotten</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.279" end="00:13:46.810" style="s2">about this because after the Second</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.160" end="00:13:50.720" style="s2">World War we we changed world view and</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.810" end="00:13:52.970" style="s2">we stopped reading the German</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.720" end="00:13:55.850" style="s2">philosophers we turn to the anglo-saxon</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.970" end="00:13:58.130" style="s2">world which returned to Oxford and</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.850" end="00:14:00.580" style="s2">Cambridge and Harvard and there of</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.130" end="00:14:05.209" style="s2">course it was the enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.580" end="00:14:07.940" style="s2">philosophers like Locke and discard with</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.209" end="00:14:10.820" style="s2">again the tabula rasa the blank slate</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.940" end="00:14:13.339" style="s2">and the mind as a rational machine that</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.820" end="00:14:15.950" style="s2">was the model that was sort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.339" end="00:14:19.180" style="s2">dominating analytical philosophy and and</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.950" end="00:14:23.270" style="s2">other thinking so we wholeheartedly</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.180" end="00:14:23.570" style="s2">imported that and contributed a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.270" end="00:14:26.380" style="s2">our own</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.570" end="00:14:28.970" style="s2">positivistic thinking there as well so</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.380" end="00:14:31.040" style="s2">today we have two completely forgotten</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.970" end="00:14:34.100" style="s2">about the importance of of inner</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.040" end="00:14:37.120" style="s2">development and are only interested in</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.100" end="00:14:39.620" style="s2">again the things that are our measure</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.120" end="00:14:43.160" style="s2">measurable in a scientific or</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.620" end="00:14:47.360" style="s2">positivistic perspective is there</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.160" end="00:14:50.810" style="s2">anything that we we we missed so far</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.360" end="00:14:53.570" style="s2">Thomas so I could just add there that I</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.810" end="00:14:58.550" style="s2">don&#39;t see that the Nordic secret as a</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.570" end="00:15:01.520" style="s2">blueprint for how we should do this</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.550" end="00:15:06.980" style="s2">today but I certainly see it as a case</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.520" end="00:15:09.829" style="s2">study showing that this interest that is</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.980" end="00:15:11.750" style="s2">growing right now for understanding the</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.829" end="00:15:15.470" style="s2">connection between our personal in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.750" end="00:15:19.459" style="s2">development and societal change that</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.470" end="00:15:23.300" style="s2">that is not a new idea that is an idea</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.459" end="00:15:26.779" style="s2">that has actually been tested at large</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.300" end="00:15:27.860" style="s2">scale in three countries a hundred years</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.779" end="00:15:31.610" style="s2">ago</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.860" end="00:15:33.079" style="s2">and it did actually work something we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.610" end="00:15:36.920" style="s2">talked about before and I really value</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.079" end="00:15:39.110" style="s2">your your perspective on is so we&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.920" end="00:15:41.750" style="s2">conversations and we&#39;re part of networks</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.110" end="00:15:46.279" style="s2">that talk about a more conscious society</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.750" end="00:15:49.100" style="s2">and more developmental society and I am</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.279" end="00:15:53.019" style="s2">interested in how much to those network</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.100" end="00:15:54.890" style="s2">or how much do those interact with</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.019" end="00:15:57.260" style="s2">policymakers with people who actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.890" end="00:15:59.149" style="s2">have levers of power because you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.260" end="00:16:00.019" style="s2">in this in this game for a lot longer</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.149" end="00:16:03.110" style="s2">than I have</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.019" end="00:16:06.649" style="s2">how do you sense of where this broader</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.110" end="00:16:08.089" style="s2">conversation is because I get a sense</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.649" end="00:16:09.709" style="s2">sometimes there&#39;s a little bubble of</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.089" end="00:16:11.690" style="s2">people talking to themselves about all</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.709" end="00:16:15.350" style="s2">of these different models and some</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.690" end="00:16:17.540" style="s2">academics and I wonder where it where</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.350" end="00:16:19.750" style="s2">it&#39;s actually intersects with with the</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.540" end="00:16:22.490" style="s2">the people who actually have kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.750" end="00:16:24.320" style="s2">agency and power in this current system</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.490" end="00:16:26.570" style="s2">what&#39;s your sense of where the</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.320" end="00:16:28.420" style="s2">conversation is at and what are the sort</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.570" end="00:16:30.980" style="s2">of pressure points at the moment between</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.420" end="00:16:33.620" style="s2">this kind of conversation and one that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.980" end="00:16:35.540" style="s2">a bit more mainstream yeah I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.620" end="00:16:39.829" style="s2">thinking and writing about about this</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.540" end="00:16:45.079" style="s2">for for at least 10 years and I ice were</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.829" end="00:16:49.370" style="s2">very little happening out in mainstream</p>

<p begin="00:16:53.810" end="00:17:05.140" style="s2">started to to happen and I think that</p>

<p begin="00:18:54.179" end="00:19:02.370" style="s2">thought before so that&#39;s the good news</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.700" end="00:19:06.380" style="s2">that the bad news is that depending on</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.370" end="00:19:13.250" style="s2">how deep we believe that this shift is</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.380" end="00:19:18.510" style="s2">it might be necessary for us to also</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.250" end="00:19:21.990" style="s2">shift our world view not only shift the</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.510" end="00:19:27.660" style="s2">system and here I think it could be</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.990" end="00:19:30.120" style="s2">useful to go back to and build on what</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.660" end="00:19:34.500" style="s2">you&#39;re done Hall was talking about again</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.120" end="00:19:39.600" style="s2">during the rebel wisdom festival over</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.500" end="00:19:45.450" style="s2">the weekend he was elaborating therefore</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.600" end="00:19:49.740" style="s2">different levels of of systems shift or</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.450" end="00:19:52.660" style="s2">systems change so so the first level he</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.740" end="00:19:54.700" style="s2">was talking about was the shift</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.660" end="00:19:58.870" style="s2">that we&#39;ve seen in society during the</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.700" end="00:20:01.240" style="s2">last say 50 years in in the Western</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.870" end="00:20:03.630" style="s2">society and that can be the the</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.240" end="00:20:07.960" style="s2">fundamental shift that has happened in</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.630" end="00:20:10.570" style="s2">areas like civil rights or gay marriage</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.960" end="00:20:14.590" style="s2">and things like that and these are</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.570" end="00:20:18.280" style="s2">important shifts but they are not very</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.590" end="00:20:21.010" style="s2">deep looked in perspective of of</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.280" end="00:20:23.860" style="s2">humanity so if we call that level one</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.010" end="00:20:26.110" style="s2">shift then level two would be something</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.860" end="00:20:30.610" style="s2">like the shift during the Industrial</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.110" end="00:20:34.570" style="s2">Revolution where the whole world system</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.610" end="00:20:37.480" style="s2">more or less shifted but still it was</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.570" end="00:20:40.060" style="s2">not a shift in world view we were still</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.480" end="00:20:43.870" style="s2">sort of operating through that level to</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.060" end="00:20:47.530" style="s2">shift with with the same worldview so</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.870" end="00:20:51.130" style="s2">then level 3 as your nan pointed out but</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.530" end="00:20:54.430" style="s2">that could be done the Enlightenment as</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.130" end="00:20:58.180" style="s2">I mentioned before when we 250 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.430" end="00:21:03.450" style="s2">say really both changed the system we</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.180" end="00:21:07.890" style="s2">went from the feudal world system into a</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.450" end="00:21:11.800" style="s2">market-based system and we went from a</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.890" end="00:21:15.880" style="s2">religious dogmatic worldview in to a</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.800" end="00:21:21.310" style="s2">scientific rational worldview and that</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.880" end="00:21:25.780" style="s2">could sort of be a level-3 shift and but</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.310" end="00:21:28.210" style="s2">then we haven&#39;t we have deeper levels so</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.780" end="00:21:29.620" style="s2">a level for shift that could be and I</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.210" end="00:21:31.810" style="s2">think Jordan was mentioning there was</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.620" end="00:21:34.630" style="s2">the Roman Empire at the end of the Roman</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.810" end="00:21:38.920" style="s2">Empire I think better might be to to</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.630" end="00:21:41.440" style="s2">talk about the axial shift that both</p>

<p begin="00:21:41.440" end="00:21:50.560" style="s2">been lecturing about how important that</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.450" end="00:21:53.340" style="s2">shift was for Humanity when we</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.560" end="00:21:58.990" style="s2">essentially left our hunter-gathering</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.340" end="00:22:04.530" style="s2">anta gatherer society the society that</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.990" end="00:22:07.970" style="s2">we have our genes have evolved to to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.530" end="00:22:11.250" style="s2">fitted with instincts to navigate and to</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.970" end="00:22:16.380" style="s2">through written language and through the</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.250" end="00:22:18.510" style="s2">large religions create a new world view</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.380" end="00:22:22.050" style="s2">but also social imaginary that made it</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.510" end="00:22:26.910" style="s2">possible for us to live in cities with</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.050" end="00:22:30.690" style="s2">tens of thousands of strangers and to</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.910" end="00:22:36.780" style="s2">even form empires so a level four shift</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.690" end="00:22:40.500" style="s2">would be the axial age shift 2500 years</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.780" end="00:22:44.360" style="s2">ago and then to yordles four levels I</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.500" end="00:22:48.240" style="s2">would want to add a fifth level because</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.360" end="00:22:50.880" style="s2">Danny as master Berger has in in a few</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.240" end="00:22:54.330" style="s2">interviews on on rebel wisdom been</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.880" end="00:22:58.590" style="s2">talking about that he believes that the</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.330" end="00:23:02.040" style="s2">shift that we are facing now could be on</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.590" end="00:23:04.770" style="s2">the level of the shifting in evolution</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.040" end="00:23:10.530" style="s2">in biological evolution when we went</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.770" end="00:23:18.500" style="s2">from single-cell organisms to multiple</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.530" end="00:23:21.300" style="s2">cell organisms and of course what change</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.500" end="00:23:23.520" style="s2">depending on how deep do we think that</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.300" end="00:23:25.890" style="s2">this change that we are facing is then</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.520" end="00:23:28.800" style="s2">of course the demand on consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.890" end="00:23:30.360" style="s2">consciousness development shift in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.800" end="00:23:33.530" style="s2">collective imaginary and all of that</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.360" end="00:23:39.290" style="s2">will be very very different but I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.530" end="00:23:43.110" style="s2">that I agree with with Daniel that</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.290" end="00:23:46.230" style="s2">humanity is now facing a possibly a</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.110" end="00:23:49.380" style="s2">level-five shift I certainly believe</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.230" end="00:23:53.610" style="s2">that we are right now facing one of</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.380" end="00:23:58.350" style="s2">those phase shifts the main question for</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.610" end="00:24:01.350" style="s2">me is how deep that shift might be I</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.350" end="00:24:04.290" style="s2">believe that it is at least a level</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.350" end="00:24:09.450" style="s2">three shift meaning that it is a shift</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.290" end="00:24:12.540" style="s2">of of equal magnitude as the shift from</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.450" end="00:24:15.870" style="s2">a medieval society to modern society the</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.540" end="00:24:18.570" style="s2">shift during the Enlightenment that will</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.870" end="00:24:23.039" style="s2">both mean that we were totally</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.570" end="00:24:27.859" style="s2">have to rebuild our society but also at</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.039" end="00:24:34.589" style="s2">the same time shift our worldview I</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.859" end="00:24:37.949" style="s2">think that the deeper the shift we are</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.589" end="00:24:42.179" style="s2">going through the deeper we have to look</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.949" end="00:24:46.289" style="s2">into ourselves into society but also</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.179" end="00:24:48.659" style="s2">back into history and that is why deep</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.289" end="00:24:51.569" style="s2">history is becoming so popular</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.659" end="00:24:55.529" style="s2">Yuval Harare sapiens or david christian</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.569" end="00:25:00.440" style="s2">maps of times for example but also deep</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.529" end="00:25:04.079" style="s2">psychological adji and deep sociology</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.440" end="00:25:06.690" style="s2">the deeper the shift the deeper we have</p>

<p begin="00:25:06.690" end="00:25:16.309" style="s2">back into history and it will also</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.799" end="00:25:19.739" style="s2">demand more of our inner capacities I</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.309" end="00:25:21.899" style="s2">think we&#39;ve talked many times over a</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.739" end="00:25:24.739" style="s2">couple of years about a sort of a big</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.899" end="00:25:27.809" style="s2">shift in culture and in society and</p>

<p begin="00:25:27.809" end="00:25:32.759" style="s2">sort of sense of a big systems change I</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.269" end="00:25:34.219" style="s2">think we we all feel that something</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.759" end="00:25:36.659" style="s2">something is happening it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.219" end="00:25:38.099" style="s2">you&#39;ve put a lot of your energy and a</p>

<p begin="00:25:43.739" end="00:25:48.989" style="s2">kind of the deep source code of society</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.719" end="00:25:50.190" style="s2">and but I really want to hear from you</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.989" end="00:25:53.249" style="s2">because I think you bring this really</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.190" end="00:25:55.739" style="s2">interesting mix of philosophy and really</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.249" end="00:25:59.219" style="s2">deep understanding with a very practical</p>

<p begin="00:26:15.269" end="00:26:23.879" style="s2">the beginning and talk a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.229" end="00:26:26.249" style="s2">about a concept that I think this</p>

<p begin="00:27:17.009" end="00:27:23.220" style="s2">little bit in the history of sociology</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.919" end="00:27:29.669" style="s2">and look into something that might be</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.220" end="00:27:35.299" style="s2">called deep sociology and looking into</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.669" end="00:27:36.980" style="s2">the very mr. practical foundation of our</p>

<p begin="00:27:36.980" end="00:27:50.360" style="s2">so Charles Eisenstein recently wrote a</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.889" end="00:27:53.389" style="s2">medium article where he argued that the</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.360" end="00:27:56.970" style="s2">separate the myth of separation is</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.389" end="00:28:00.629" style="s2">holding us right now in in a grip so the</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.970" end="00:28:04.529" style="s2">book I wrote out of banking was called</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.629" end="00:28:08.070" style="s2">the market myth so I also had the same</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.529" end="00:28:11.759" style="s2">sort of answer as Charles that what is</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.070" end="00:28:16.950" style="s2">holding society in a grip is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.759" end="00:28:21.629" style="s2">myth and sociology and deep sociology is</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.950" end="00:28:26.789" style="s2">actually studying how these deep myths</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.629" end="00:28:33.499" style="s2">of society is creating what some</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.789" end="00:28:37.230" style="s2">sociologists like the the very famous</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.499" end="00:28:43.820" style="s2">social scientist Charles Taylor calls in</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.230" end="00:28:46.320" style="s2">his book from I think it&#39;s 2004 the</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.820" end="00:28:49.320" style="s2">modern social imaginaries is</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.320" end="00:28:52.279" style="s2">a book called and so he gives us the</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.320" end="00:28:58.110" style="s2">name the social imaginaries the</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.279" end="00:29:03.659" style="s2">french-canadian sociologist gerard</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.110" end="00:29:06.149" style="s2">Bouchard in his book social myths and</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.659" end="00:29:08.820" style="s2">collective imaginaries from just a few</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.149" end="00:29:11.899" style="s2">years ago he really connects this</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.820" end="00:29:15.080" style="s2">concept on these deep fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.899" end="00:29:18.149" style="s2">societal myths that every society has</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.080" end="00:29:21.000" style="s2">whether the society is aware of it or</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.149" end="00:29:24.419" style="s2">not with this concept of the collective</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.000" end="00:29:27.870" style="s2">imaginary so then what is this</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.419" end="00:29:31.679" style="s2">collective imaginary well it is</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.870" end="00:29:37.009" style="s2">something that is even deeper than what</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.679" end="00:29:41.299" style="s2">we usually mean by for example ideology</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.009" end="00:29:44.159" style="s2">so ideology we are at least partially</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.299" end="00:29:47.009" style="s2">aware of but these collective</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.159" end="00:29:51.330" style="s2">imaginaries the major part of them we</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.009" end="00:29:57.059" style="s2">are totally unaware of but but still</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.330" end="00:29:59.730" style="s2">they form our society in an unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.059" end="00:30:02.639" style="s2">way just like our own individual deep</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.730" end="00:30:06.809" style="s2">unconscious is forming the way that we</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.639" end="00:30:10.470" style="s2">act the social imaginaries are forming</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.809" end="00:30:14.970" style="s2">the way a society acts and this can</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.470" end="00:30:18.059" style="s2">sound very very abstract but I think it</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.970" end="00:30:25.019" style="s2">might be clearer if I if I give an</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.059" end="00:30:33.450" style="s2">example so a good example of a social</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.019" end="00:30:35.789" style="s2">imaginary is actually money and if we</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.450" end="00:30:39.870" style="s2">look at money from an individual</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.789" end="00:30:42.299" style="s2">perspective in the modern world we are</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.870" end="00:30:45.179" style="s2">equally one could argue that we as</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.299" end="00:30:50.070" style="s2">individuals are equally dependent on air</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.179" end="00:30:51.899" style="s2">or oxygen and on money to live in the in</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.070" end="00:30:58.500" style="s2">the modern world we need air to breathe</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.899" end="00:30:59.240" style="s2">and we need money to to survive but if</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.500" end="00:31:02.000" style="s2">we look at</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.240" end="00:31:05.299" style="s2">collective level there is a there is an</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.000" end="00:31:11.080" style="s2">important difference between money and</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.299" end="00:31:16.010" style="s2">oxygen because if we even if we</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.080" end="00:31:18.740" style="s2">collected all humans and collectively</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.010" end="00:31:23.390" style="s2">decided that we do not want to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.740" end="00:31:25.809" style="s2">dependent on oxygen we couldn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.390" end="00:31:28.370" style="s2">anything about that natural dependence</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.809" end="00:31:30.620" style="s2">but of course if we gathered all of</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.370" end="00:31:34.149" style="s2">humanity or even everyone in a</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.620" end="00:31:36.590" style="s2">nation-state and we decided that we</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.149" end="00:31:39.140" style="s2">wanted to have another way of allocating</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.590" end="00:31:42.820" style="s2">the goods in society then using money</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.140" end="00:31:45.919" style="s2">then money could be gone tomorrow and</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.820" end="00:31:51.110" style="s2">this sort of very fundamental difference</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.919" end="00:31:54.260" style="s2">between concepts like natural concepts</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.110" end="00:32:00.289" style="s2">like air and oxygen and socially</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.260" end="00:32:04.640" style="s2">constructed things that is really the</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.289" end="00:32:08.679" style="s2">the important learning from the concept</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.640" end="00:32:12.529" style="s2">of collective imagined imaginaries and</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.679" end="00:32:18.409" style="s2">as they are so different one could even</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.529" end="00:32:23.179" style="s2">say that oxygen and money have different</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.409" end="00:32:26.020" style="s2">ontologies to use a fancy word so they</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.179" end="00:32:28.309" style="s2">are so fundamentally different and</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.020" end="00:32:33.020" style="s2">because they are so fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.309" end="00:32:35.510" style="s2">different we also need different ways of</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.020" end="00:32:38.899" style="s2">understanding them we need different</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.510" end="00:32:41.110" style="s2">approaches to them and of course one of</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.899" end="00:32:45.049" style="s2">the problems with the science of RV</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.110" end="00:32:47.630" style="s2">economy is that one that science has for</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.049" end="00:32:52.730" style="s2">the last hundred years been using</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.630" end="00:32:58.429" style="s2">natural science as a model and I found</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.730" end="00:33:01.580" style="s2">it much more useful as an financial</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.429" end="00:33:05.630" style="s2">entrepreneur to understand the market</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.580" end="00:33:08.270" style="s2">not as a natural phenomenon trying to</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.630" end="00:33:12.679" style="s2">model it with natural science tool as</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.270" end="00:33:17.499" style="s2">the neoclassical economic thinking</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.679" end="00:33:20.179" style="s2">but rather look at the market as a</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.499" end="00:33:23.840" style="s2">sociological phenomenon as something</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.179" end="00:33:26.059" style="s2">that is socially constructed and as it</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.840" end="00:33:31.070" style="s2">is socially constructed it can actually</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.059" end="00:33:33.919" style="s2">be reconstructed by us humans and and</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.070" end="00:33:37.340" style="s2">that is a very very fundamental insight</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.919" end="00:33:40.549" style="s2">and is the is the idea of the social</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.340" end="00:33:42.740" style="s2">imaginary more than just the market yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.549" end="00:33:46.249" style="s2">I mean this is everything</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.740" end="00:33:48.769" style="s2">as I said it&#39;s deeper than is actually</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.249" end="00:33:56.149" style="s2">captured in the terms like zeitgeist or</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.769" end="00:33:59.990" style="s2">or or ideology it&#39;s more close to the</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.149" end="00:34:03.019" style="s2">popular term the popular culture term</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.990" end="00:34:07.249" style="s2">the matrix that comes much much closer</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.019" end="00:34:11.569" style="s2">to what we are talking about in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.249" end="00:34:16.760" style="s2">social imaginary is really to us like</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.569" end="00:34:20.299" style="s2">water is to the fish we can&#39;t see it but</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.760" end="00:34:25.069" style="s2">we are totally dependent on it so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.299" end="00:34:29.149" style="s2">it&#39;s really all our social myths it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.069" end="00:34:36.919" style="s2">all our collective values</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.149" end="00:34:40.760" style="s2">it&#39;s our root metaphors and we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.919" end="00:34:43.250" style="s2">usually see this but it is really when</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.760" end="00:34:46.309" style="s2">the social imaginaries become</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.250" end="00:34:49.549" style="s2">dysfunctional that we can start to</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.309" end="00:34:52.490" style="s2">capture a glimpse of them so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.549" end="00:34:56.990" style="s2">the the glitch in the matrix it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.490" end="00:34:59.000" style="s2">through the glitch that we start to to</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.990" end="00:35:02.150" style="s2">be aware of them and especially when</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.000" end="00:35:05.420" style="s2">they are not serving our our interests</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.150" end="00:35:07.880" style="s2">either as individuals or or collectively</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.420" end="00:35:10.819" style="s2">when we sort of start to feel that there</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.880" end="00:35:13.160" style="s2">is this strong force in society that we</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.819" end="00:35:16.040" style="s2">don&#39;t know where it&#39;s coming from but</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.160" end="00:35:21.589" style="s2">it&#39;s certainly not serving our interests</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.040" end="00:35:24.859" style="s2">then it is probably probably the the</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.589" end="00:35:26.490" style="s2">organizing the orchestrating power of</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.859" end="00:35:29.160" style="s2">the collective imaginary</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.490" end="00:35:31.590" style="s2">that we are feeling and when the stress</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.160" end="00:35:36.050" style="s2">on the collective imaginary becomes too</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.590" end="00:35:38.810" style="s2">large then like any again like any</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.050" end="00:35:42.119" style="s2">self-organizing collecting</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.810" end="00:35:45.030" style="s2">self-organizing complex system then we</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.119" end="00:35:49.140" style="s2">have a phase shift then something quite</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.030" end="00:35:52.260" style="s2">rapidly changes and the last time we had</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.140" end="00:35:54.869" style="s2">such a fundamental shift in in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.260" end="00:35:57.990" style="s2">matrix in the collective imaginary that</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.869" end="00:36:03.920" style="s2">was during the Enlightenment when we</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.990" end="00:36:10.140" style="s2">went from a dogmatic religious worldview</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.920" end="00:36:13.920" style="s2">into a scientific rational worldview and</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.140" end="00:36:17.580" style="s2">we left such a as ideas as for example</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.920" end="00:36:20.369" style="s2">the Divine Right of Kings that really</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.580" end="00:36:25.440" style="s2">nobody questioned during the Middle Ages</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.369" end="00:36:28.170" style="s2">and we got new myths instead like the</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.440" end="00:36:31.290" style="s2">market myth or the myth of separation</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.170" end="00:36:34.200" style="s2">and and the number of these wrote myths</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.290" end="00:36:37.590" style="s2">that we have that we cannot really see</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.200" end="00:36:42.359" style="s2">but that something like the coalbed</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.590" end="00:36:44.850" style="s2">crisis can start to make us conscious of</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.359" end="00:36:47.850" style="s2">and especially this myth of the step of</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.850" end="00:36:51.750" style="s2">separation I think the Kovach crisis has</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.850" end="00:36:53.640" style="s2">made many of us wake up to to the fact</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.750" end="00:36:58.320" style="s2">that we are much much more</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.640" end="00:37:01.770" style="s2">interdependent then we we usually think</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.320" end="00:37:04.800" style="s2">we we are so in that way the kovat</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.770" end="00:37:08.250" style="s2">crisis could be sort of a awakening up</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.800" end="00:37:10.950" style="s2">from from the collective imaginary that</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.250" end="00:37:16.080" style="s2">we are living in also I should mention</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.950" end="00:37:21.180" style="s2">that the collective imaginary is really</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.080" end="00:37:25.230" style="s2">important not only does it inform our</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.180" end="00:37:28.170" style="s2">sense making but it also shapes what</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.230" end="00:37:32.250" style="s2">john de vega is calling the our salience</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.170" end="00:37:35.190" style="s2">landscape so depending on our collective</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.250" end="00:37:37.980" style="s2">imaginary different things becomes</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.190" end="00:37:40.460" style="s2">important to us and we are using these</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.980" end="00:37:43.070" style="s2">route metaphors and these rule</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.460" end="00:37:47.450" style="s2">myths of the collective imaginary to</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.070" end="00:37:50.300" style="s2">make sense of the world but but not only</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.450" end="00:37:52.849" style="s2">does the collective imaginary inform our</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.300" end="00:37:56.780" style="s2">sense making and our salience landscape</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.849" end="00:37:58.640" style="s2">it also shapes our desire and that is</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.780" end="00:38:02.480" style="s2">what Daniel smashing burger point</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.640" end="00:38:06.020" style="s2">pointed out at the rebel wisdom festival</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.480" end="00:38:06.589" style="s2">last weekend with a reference to energy</p>

<p begin="00:38:06.589" end="00:38:13.940" style="s2">he said that desire is mimetic meaning</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.220" end="00:38:17.000" style="s2">that we do not even sort of own our own</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.940" end="00:38:19.400" style="s2">desire our desire is dependent on our</p>

<p begin="00:38:19.400" end="00:38:27.650" style="s2">imaginary so these things are super</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.820" end="00:38:31.930" style="s2">important and again as they are to us</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.650" end="00:38:36.470" style="s2">like water is to the fish it really</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.930" end="00:38:39.890" style="s2">demands an effort from us to start to</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.470" end="00:38:43.430" style="s2">see this collective imaginary but once</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.890" end="00:38:47.200" style="s2">you have weight woken up to see it then</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.430" end="00:38:52.670" style="s2">then you start to see it everywhere and</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.200" end="00:38:56.720" style="s2">I could almost point at a point where I</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.670" end="00:39:00.160" style="s2">in a more embodied way really became</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.720" end="00:39:04.880" style="s2">aware of this collective imaginary and</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.160" end="00:39:07.700" style="s2">that was actually when I a few years ago</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.880" end="00:39:12.200" style="s2">together with my then 21 year old son</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.700" end="00:39:13.910" style="s2">Alexander went to Burning Man and what</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.200" end="00:39:15.530" style="s2">God got me interested in going to</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.910" end="00:39:18.980" style="s2">Burning Man was that I had many friends</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.530" end="00:39:21.920" style="s2">coming back from Burning Man pointing</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.980" end="00:39:26.270" style="s2">out that they could not any longer</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.920" end="00:39:29.690" style="s2">look at this default reality with the</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.270" end="00:39:31.310" style="s2">same naive eyes because they&#39;re of</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.690" end="00:39:34.130" style="s2">course at Burning Man you start from</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.310" end="00:39:37.280" style="s2">scratch and you build a complete it</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.130" end="00:39:40.310" style="s2">together your co-create a completely</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.280" end="00:39:41.660" style="s2">different collective imaginary out in</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.310" end="00:39:45.160" style="s2">the desert and you live in that</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.660" end="00:39:49.160" style="s2">collective imaginary with other values</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.160" end="00:39:51.980" style="s2">without any money and you actually see</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.160" end="00:39:53.750" style="s2">that for yourself that you can shift the</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.980" end="00:39:56.480" style="s2">collective imaginary</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.750" end="00:39:58.790" style="s2">society is still functioning but in a</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.480" end="00:40:01.910" style="s2">different way so then when you come back</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.790" end="00:40:04.520" style="s2">to the default reality you you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.910" end="00:40:08.690" style="s2">really see the world with the same naive</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.520" end="00:40:12.460" style="s2">eyes so I think it&#39;s good that more and</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.690" end="00:40:15.070" style="s2">more people are waking up to to this</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.460" end="00:40:18.560" style="s2">concept and that we are not only</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.070" end="00:40:21.800" style="s2">rediscovering deep psychology but that</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.560" end="00:40:24.950" style="s2">we are also a bit rediscovering deep</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.800" end="00:40:27.800" style="s2">sociology you know there&#39;s a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.950" end="00:40:30.110" style="s2">thoughts that come to mind or questions</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.800" end="00:40:31.430" style="s2">that come to mind one of which is where</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.110" end="00:40:33.950" style="s2">do you think we&#39;re at in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.430" end="00:40:36.350" style="s2">Kovach crisis and the other question is</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.950" end="00:40:39.920" style="s2">do you think people are becoming more</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.350" end="00:40:41.990" style="s2">aware of the the nature of a collective</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.920" end="00:40:44.050" style="s2">imaginary because of the Cova crisis</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.990" end="00:40:46.430" style="s2">because so many things we thought were</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.050" end="00:40:51.320" style="s2">set in stone about the way we&#39;re living</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.430" end="00:40:54.020" style="s2">have shifted on a daily basis and if so</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.320" end="00:40:55.550" style="s2">what what relevance do you think that is</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.020" end="00:41:01.360" style="s2">and do you think that&#39;s an opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.550" end="00:41:06.140" style="s2">to change yeah so certainly I think that</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.360" end="00:41:09.260" style="s2">the kovat crisis makes more people wake</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.140" end="00:41:13.190" style="s2">up not not only to the myth of</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.260" end="00:41:16.430" style="s2">separation but also starting to to see</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.190" end="00:41:19.550" style="s2">the collective imaginary the problem</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.430" end="00:41:23.870" style="s2">there is that we don&#39;t really have an</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.550" end="00:41:26.770" style="s2">everyday or popular name for these</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.870" end="00:41:28.760" style="s2">things that anthropologists and</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.770" end="00:41:34.010" style="s2">sociologists have been talking about for</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.760" end="00:41:37.280" style="s2">at least 50 years and that is why I am</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.010" end="00:41:40.070" style="s2">trying to champion the collective</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.280" end="00:41:46.280" style="s2">imaginary there the term of Gerard</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.070" end="00:41:50.990" style="s2">Bouchard as a good name for this matrix</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.280" end="00:41:53.480" style="s2">and I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s that we are</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.990" end="00:41:55.790" style="s2">perhaps waking up and all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.480" end="00:41:58.490" style="s2">that we see this collective imaginary</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.790" end="00:42:01.730" style="s2">but we certainly get a feeling for that</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.490" end="00:42:04.370" style="s2">it&#39;s something is something is wrong and</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.730" end="00:42:07.160" style="s2">I think that that is one what again</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.370" end="00:42:10.910" style="s2">Charles Eisenstein was</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.160" end="00:42:14.480" style="s2">trying to convey in his medium article</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.910" end="00:42:16.910" style="s2">that a lot of people feel that something</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.480" end="00:42:22.970" style="s2">is wrong and then it&#39;s just so natural</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.910" end="00:42:27.920" style="s2">for us humans to start to look at so why</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.970" end="00:42:30.440" style="s2">do I feel this orchestrating power that</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.920" end="00:42:34.100" style="s2">is making things happen in a direction</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.440" end="00:42:36.680" style="s2">in in in society what is this and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.100" end="00:42:40.370" style="s2">again it&#39;s just so natural for us humans</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.680" end="00:42:42.500" style="s2">to then ascribe some human agency to</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.370" end="00:42:45.050" style="s2">that and of course sometimes there is a</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.500" end="00:42:47.960" style="s2">human agency behind of course but in</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.050" end="00:42:53.050" style="s2">many many cases these orchestrating</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.960" end="00:42:57.380" style="s2">power is actually the power of our</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.050" end="00:43:00.440" style="s2">unconscious social imaginary acting and</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.380" end="00:43:05.450" style="s2">making things happen and again when</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.440" end="00:43:08.210" style="s2">these things seems to not be helpful</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.450" end="00:43:11.780" style="s2">then of course you start to to question</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.210" end="00:43:15.410" style="s2">this so at least the cope with crisis is</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.780" end="00:43:18.440" style="s2">a starting point for bringing up the</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.410" end="00:43:21.170" style="s2">issue of our collective imaginary and</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.440" end="00:43:23.870" style="s2">how important it is to start to see it</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.170" end="00:43:27.280" style="s2">but also to realize that it is a human</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.870" end="00:43:30.410" style="s2">construct and that we we collectively</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.280" end="00:43:33.770" style="s2">can change it and that we throughout</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.410" end="00:43:35.690" style="s2">history collectively unconsciously most</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.770" end="00:43:39.410" style="s2">of the time but sometimes consciously</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.690" end="00:43:42.440" style="s2">have created it so now it&#39;s time for us</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.410" end="00:43:44.410" style="s2">to be consciously aware of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.440" end="00:43:47.210" style="s2">collective imaginary and actually take</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.410" end="00:43:50.420" style="s2">responsibility for the collective</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.210" end="00:43:53.530" style="s2">imaginary and again you were asking that</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.420" end="00:43:56.120" style="s2">about post-modernism of course this is</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.530" end="00:43:59.210" style="s2">actually a fundamentally postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.120" end="00:44:04.370" style="s2">insight that we have in society these</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.210" end="00:44:06.260" style="s2">power structures and that we need to to</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.370" end="00:44:09.380" style="s2">look carefully into these power</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.260" end="00:44:12.080" style="s2">structures where post-modernism goes</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.380" end="00:44:16.820" style="s2">goes wrong sometimes at least in its</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.080" end="00:44:20.290" style="s2">more extreme form that is when some post</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.820" end="00:44:23.860" style="s2">modernist philosophers claim that</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.290" end="00:44:26.980" style="s2">every aspect of the world is socially</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.860" end="00:44:30.610" style="s2">constructed even for example every</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.980" end="00:44:33.730" style="s2">single aspect of of gender is socially</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.610" end="00:44:36.580" style="s2">constructed and that even air and oxygen</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.730" end="00:44:39.190" style="s2">is socially constructed no of course not</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.580" end="00:44:41.770" style="s2">you need to make a separation that and</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.190" end="00:44:45.490" style="s2">understand that that sometimes you</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.770" end="00:44:48.670" style="s2">actually have to deal with with nature</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.490" end="00:44:53.200" style="s2">and the constraints of nature as a</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.670" end="00:44:57.400" style="s2">starting point and for example we were</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.200" end="00:44:59.950" style="s2">talking before about the fact that we</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.400" end="00:45:03.340" style="s2">feel as individuals that we are equally</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.950" end="00:45:04.840" style="s2">dependent on oxygen and money and that</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.340" end="00:45:07.660" style="s2">we can actually not do anything about</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.840" end="00:45:11.320" style="s2">oxygen or dependency on oxygen but we</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.660" end="00:45:14.140" style="s2">can do anything we want about the fact</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.320" end="00:45:19.540" style="s2">that we are dependent on money sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.140" end="00:45:23.500" style="s2">I feel like we understand the world</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.540" end="00:45:27.010" style="s2">exactly the opposite way that we somehow</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.500" end="00:45:32.830" style="s2">believe that the planetary boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.010" end="00:45:36.210" style="s2">are up for negotiation but that the</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.830" end="00:45:38.800" style="s2">market forces we just have to obey obey</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.210" end="00:45:41.740" style="s2">when of course it&#39;s it&#39;s completely the</p>

<p begin="00:45:52.830" end="00:45:58.240" style="s2">this is something that many philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.290" end="00:46:03.900" style="s2">throughout history has been pointing out</p>

<p begin="00:46:16.780" end="00:46:24.640" style="s2">the world of oxygen and gravitation the</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.370" end="00:46:28.630" style="s2">next one is our inner world the world of</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.640" end="00:46:32.410" style="s2">dreams and fantasies and values and</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.630" end="00:46:34.210" style="s2">meaning and purpose and then the third</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.410" end="00:46:37.260" style="s2">world that is the collective</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.210" end="00:46:41.710" style="s2">imaginary the socially constructed world</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.260" end="00:46:44.320" style="s2">that has got its own ontology something</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.710" end="00:46:48.220" style="s2">like between the natural world and and</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.320" end="00:46:51.790" style="s2">our and our inner world and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.220" end="00:46:53.800" style="s2">big problems with with the way that we</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.790" end="00:46:56.820" style="s2">have throughout history understood our</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.800" end="00:46:59.140" style="s2">human predicament has been that we have</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.820" end="00:47:01.780" style="s2">during most times of history been</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.140" end="00:47:05.349" style="s2">relying on one of these three</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.780" end="00:47:07.869" style="s2">perspectives too heavily so for example</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.349" end="00:47:11.170" style="s2">during the last hundreds hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.869" end="00:47:14.980" style="s2">years since the Enlightenment the</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.170" end="00:47:18.190" style="s2">scientific worldview that is very strong</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.980" end="00:47:20.880" style="s2">when it comes to investigating the the</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.190" end="00:47:24.580" style="s2">natural world has so completely</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.880" end="00:47:27.040" style="s2">dominated our understanding of of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.580" end="00:47:30.220" style="s2">world that we are even trying as I said</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.040" end="00:47:33.660" style="s2">before to understand the socially</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.220" end="00:47:37.690" style="s2">constructed market as a natural</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.660" end="00:47:42.180" style="s2">phenomenon and there of course post</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.690" end="00:47:45.520" style="s2">post-modernism was a good critique of</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.180" end="00:47:49.599" style="s2">our too much rely on us too much lying</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.520" end="00:47:51.880" style="s2">on on on the scientific perspective of</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.599" end="00:47:54.339" style="s2">the natural world but then again when</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.880" end="00:47:57.640" style="s2">post modernist thinking goes too far</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.339" end="00:48:00.339" style="s2">then you go wrong there as well and then</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.640" end="00:48:03.790" style="s2">even in some spiritual traditions there</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.339" end="00:48:06.820" style="s2">has been a focus on the inner world and</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.790" end="00:48:09.550" style="s2">in some cases too much focus on the</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.820" end="00:48:12.460" style="s2">inner world where you have perhaps the</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.550" end="00:48:14.710" style="s2">idea that the only thing that really</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.460" end="00:48:18.570" style="s2">matters and perhaps the only thing that</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.710" end="00:48:22.830" style="s2">really exists is your inner experience</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.570" end="00:48:26.560" style="s2">but I would say no that&#39;s not the case</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.830" end="00:48:28.660" style="s2">Society is real and society is causing</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.560" end="00:48:30.700" style="s2">real suffering so if you are only</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.660" end="00:48:33.160" style="s2">concentrating on the inner world you are</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.700" end="00:48:36.460" style="s2">missing important aspects of the world</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.160" end="00:48:40.750" style="s2">so in our complex sense making today if</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.460" end="00:48:43.540" style="s2">if I would give one recommendation that</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.750" end="00:48:47.340" style="s2">would really be to try to start to see</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.540" end="00:48:49.890" style="s2">the world from at least these three</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.340" end="00:48:51.770" style="s2">different perspectives and understand</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.890" end="00:48:54.420" style="s2">that we need different tools to</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.770" end="00:48:57.540" style="s2">understand the natural aspects of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.420" end="00:48:59.580" style="s2">human world the inner aspects of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.540" end="00:49:01.560" style="s2">human world including our consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.580" end="00:49:03.690" style="s2">and consciousness development our</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.560" end="00:49:06.240" style="s2">potential for consciousness development</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.690" end="00:49:09.720" style="s2">and then the socially constructed world</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.240" end="00:49:12.000" style="s2">our collective imaginary and try to hold</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.720" end="00:49:16.560" style="s2">all of those perspectives there at the</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.000" end="00:49:20.400" style="s2">same time and in all of the shifts level</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.560" end="00:49:23.460" style="s2">three or deeper we can really talk about</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.400" end="00:49:27.000" style="s2">that we are in a world between worlds in</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.460" end="00:49:29.790" style="s2">this shift and john de vega has pointed</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.000" end="00:49:34.260" style="s2">out that that in shifts like that</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.790" end="00:49:39.600" style="s2">we need new psycho technologies to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.260" end="00:49:41.130" style="s2">able to develop new inner capacities so</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.600" end="00:49:44.310" style="s2">i certainly think that that that is</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.130" end="00:49:46.740" style="s2">something that we need to urgently look</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.310" end="00:49:50.910" style="s2">into now at the same time as we are</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.740" end="00:49:55.470" style="s2">prototyping and trying to support this</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.910" end="00:49:59.070" style="s2">fundamental system shift that that is</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.470" end="00:50:02.280" style="s2">going to be emergent so we will not be</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.070" end="00:50:06.120" style="s2">able to plan it we will not be able to</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.280" end="00:50:09.510" style="s2">manage this shift but we might be able</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.120" end="00:50:12.750" style="s2">to facilitate this shift happening</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.510" end="00:50:17.180" style="s2">because we shall remember that in these</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.750" end="00:50:21.180" style="s2">systems shifts systems can go two ways</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.180" end="00:50:23.510" style="s2">we can either have a step up in</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.180" end="00:50:27.140" style="s2">complexity and in elegance of</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.510" end="00:50:29.460" style="s2">organization or we can have a break down</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.140" end="00:50:33.830" style="s2">so when we reach one of these</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.460" end="00:50:38.190" style="s2">bifurcation points we can either have a</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.830" end="00:50:42.740" style="s2">breakthrough or a breakdown and as many</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.190" end="00:50:46.770" style="s2">as pointed out on your channel</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.740" end="00:50:52.350" style="s2">civilizations tend to break down that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.770" end="00:50:54.240" style="s2">the normal development for civilizations</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.350" end="00:50:58.020" style="s2">the challenge right now is of course</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.240" end="00:51:01.250" style="s2">that our civilization this time is is</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.020" end="00:51:04.590" style="s2">global even when the Roman Empire</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.250" end="00:51:07.410" style="s2">collapse that there were that was not a</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.590" end="00:51:10.130" style="s2">global collapse that was a collapse of</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.410" end="00:51:12.390" style="s2">part of the globe but if we have a</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.130" end="00:51:14.870" style="s2">civilizational collapse now perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.390" end="00:51:18.330" style="s2">involving in an environmental disaster</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.870" end="00:51:20.760" style="s2">or a nuclear disaster or something then</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.330" end="00:51:24.000" style="s2">then it&#39;s really the whole world so we</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.760" end="00:51:27.480" style="s2">can&#39;t rely on the way that humanity has</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.000" end="00:51:31.940" style="s2">sort of managed these transitions before</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.480" end="00:51:35.550" style="s2">in a more or less trial and error manner</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.940" end="00:51:39.390" style="s2">so this this time we have to somehow do</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.550" end="00:51:42.660" style="s2">this consciously even if we cannot plan</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.390" end="00:51:45.720" style="s2">it and even if we cannot even see what</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.660" end="00:51:48.470" style="s2">the next civilization so some people</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.720" end="00:51:53.120" style="s2">would call game B but there what that</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.470" end="00:51:56.460" style="s2">implementation might actually look like</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.120" end="00:52:00.120" style="s2">but we can facilitate it and again I</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.460" end="00:52:02.640" style="s2">agree with John delay here that trying</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.120" end="00:52:05.130" style="s2">and experimenting with different psycho</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.640" end="00:52:09.000" style="s2">technologies that will help us develop</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.130" end="00:52:12.540" style="s2">new capacities to to both see the world</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.000" end="00:52:13.560" style="s2">but also to relate to ourselves relate</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.540" end="00:52:16.320" style="s2">to each other</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.560" end="00:52:20.220" style="s2">relate to society and relate to nature</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.320" end="00:52:22.460" style="s2">in deeper ways that I think is a is at</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.220" end="00:52:27.660" style="s2">least a requisite for a successful</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.460" end="00:52:30.390" style="s2">transition so I think that in this</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.660" end="00:52:33.210" style="s2">transition that we are facing now</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.390" end="00:52:35.460" style="s2">that we don&#39;t know how deep it will be I</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.210" end="00:52:38.640" style="s2">certainly think it will be a at least a</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.460" end="00:52:42.360" style="s2">level 3 trend transition and that we</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.640" end="00:52:45.410" style="s2">then again need to focus on inner</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.360" end="00:52:48.120" style="s2">development developing the capacities to</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.410" end="00:52:51.330" style="s2">understand and to handle the world and</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.120" end="00:52:55.350" style="s2">to relate in in deeper and more complex</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.330" end="00:52:58.590" style="s2">ways and that that is not just something</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.350" end="00:52:59.850" style="s2">that a few people in some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.590" end="00:53:03.780" style="s2">intellectual elite</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.850" end="00:53:05.790" style="s2">need to do for this to shift to happen a</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.780" end="00:53:07.860" style="s2">large part of</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.790" end="00:53:12.930" style="s2">the population actually needs to be able</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.860" end="00:53:16.140" style="s2">to hold this shift so Kristen is how can</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.930" end="00:53:18.510" style="s2">we do that today and and there I want to</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.140" end="00:53:22.650" style="s2">mention one initiative that my</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.510" end="00:53:25.740" style="s2">foundation is involved with together</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.650" end="00:53:30.870" style="s2">with the nauseum foundation in Sweden</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.740" end="00:53:34.590" style="s2">called 29k 29k dot org which is a</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.870" end="00:53:40.230" style="s2">digital platform where we are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.590" end="00:53:44.090" style="s2">see if we can successfully use a digital</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.230" end="00:53:45.960" style="s2">platform to replicate some of these</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.090" end="00:53:48.720" style="s2">facilitation techniques and</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.960" end="00:53:51.960" style="s2">interventions that we have been using at</p>

<p begin="00:53:58.110" end="00:54:06.690" style="s2">than 50 years if we can try to replicate</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.210" end="00:54:09.000" style="s2">that in a digital environment that is of</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.690" end="00:54:11.690" style="s2">course scalable in a completely</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.000" end="00:54:15.900" style="s2">different way than these in real life</p>

<p begin="00:54:15.900" end="00:54:22.370" style="s2">deep change you do need the in real life</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.740" end="00:54:27.890" style="s2">experience that you can certainly</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.370" end="00:54:32.370" style="s2">increase the interest and also do some</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.890" end="00:54:35.880" style="s2">work on on a digital platform we have to</p>
