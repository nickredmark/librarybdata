<p begin="00:00:00.170" end="00:00:07.379" style="s2">all right we are live well to project</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.400" end="00:00:09.599" style="s2">raising for culture creation</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.379" end="00:00:13.980" style="s2">Thank You Richie and Kylie for joining</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.599" end="00:00:15.330" style="s2">us you&#39;d realize like always here do you</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.980" end="00:00:18.840" style="s2">want to give us a brief rundown Richie</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.330" end="00:00:21.240" style="s2">of what culture creation is or if I said</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.840" end="00:00:22.730" style="s2">it wrong the actual name of it and then</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.240" end="00:00:25.619" style="s2">what you&#39;re out of Road</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.730" end="00:00:28.529" style="s2">yeah sure I&#39;m so this culture create it</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.619" end="00:00:32.189" style="s2">and yeah it&#39;s just a small project of</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.529" end="00:00:35.280" style="s2">mine the idea is to get a group of</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.189" end="00:00:39.780" style="s2">people together and see if we can refine</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.280" end="00:00:46.260" style="s2">a culture together that is directed more</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.780" end="00:00:50.480" style="s2">at building stronger bonds taking care</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.260" end="00:00:51.860" style="s2">of one another more effectively becoming</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.480" end="00:00:58.949" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.860" end="00:01:01.079" style="s2">more of fictive it is a great just you</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.949" end="00:01:02.910" style="s2">know it&#39;s it&#39;s pretty broad in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.079" end="00:01:05.670" style="s2">the things that I&#39;m hoping to achieve</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.910" end="00:01:08.909" style="s2">with it which means it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.670" end="00:01:11.159" style="s2">quite difficult to really communicate to</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.909" end="00:01:13.799" style="s2">the people went to other people you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.159" end="00:01:19.920" style="s2">what the scope is but my hope is that we</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.799" end="00:01:23.430" style="s2">can find a few that make the project</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.920" end="00:01:25.290" style="s2">kind of self-sustaining I&#39;d like it to</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.430" end="00:01:27.119" style="s2">be really goal orientated so that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.290" end="00:01:30.560" style="s2">always doing something new and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.119" end="00:01:35.159" style="s2">learning new skills and developing</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.560" end="00:01:40.409" style="s2">anything personal growth yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.159" end="00:01:45.390" style="s2">kind of it all right for those the</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.409" end="00:01:52.200" style="s2">aspirations in there that&#39;s part of it</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.390" end="00:01:53.520" style="s2">you yeah yeah my pen wasn&#39;t working so I</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.200" end="00:01:58.020" style="s2">didn&#39;t really and I can&#39;t read my</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.520" end="00:02:00.540" style="s2">writing now but to find a way to make it</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.020" end="00:02:03.869" style="s2">self-sustaining and you want to remain</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.540" end="00:02:05.850" style="s2">cool oriented I believe when I read the</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.869" end="00:02:09.569" style="s2">paper you had written it&#39;s very like</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.850" end="00:02:12.690" style="s2">personal development meets actual like a</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.569" end="00:02:13.250" style="s2">project but not a long-term project more</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.690" end="00:02:16.570" style="s2">of like a</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.250" end="00:02:22.640" style="s2">project or I&#39;m something that you can</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.570" end="00:02:24.440" style="s2">get right away is that crap yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.640" end="00:02:26.780" style="s2">well well what I&#39;m hoping to have what</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.440" end="00:02:29.330" style="s2">the different projects</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.780" end="00:02:31.850" style="s2">over the span of time so at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.330" end="00:02:34.670" style="s2">in the document that&#39;s up there I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.850" end="00:02:38.090" style="s2">divided decisions to the the</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.670" end="00:02:39.770" style="s2">conversation side so that&#39;s what we do</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.090" end="00:02:42.440" style="s2">like a medic group meditation we can</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.770" end="00:02:45.530" style="s2">come up with a an ecology of practices</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.440" end="00:02:52.190" style="s2">that we can you know do together and</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.530" end="00:02:53.420" style="s2">then do some sense making to learn to</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.190" end="00:02:56.390" style="s2">really communicate with one another and</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.420" end="00:03:01.220" style="s2">build some some overlapping semantic</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.390" end="00:03:05.900" style="s2">mapping and then the second week or you</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.220" end="00:03:07.459" style="s2">know we&#39;ve we&#39;ve spaced it out is sends</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.900" end="00:03:09.170" style="s2">it around going out and doing something</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.459" end="00:03:13.010" style="s2">so we might go and clean like a river</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.170" end="00:03:14.750" style="s2">like clear rubbish or we might learn a</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.010" end="00:03:16.310" style="s2">skill maybe there&#39;s someone in the group</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.750" end="00:03:19.580" style="s2">who&#39;s got a skill that they could teach</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.310" end="00:03:21.049" style="s2">the group and part of part of the point</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.580" end="00:03:23.690" style="s2">of that is that we have this rolling</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.049" end="00:03:26.630" style="s2">leadership ethos about it so rather than</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.690" end="00:03:28.280" style="s2">any one person being the leader or like</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.630" end="00:03:30.320" style="s2">the core organizer or something like</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.280" end="00:03:32.890" style="s2">that everyone takes the turn at</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.320" end="00:03:36.140" style="s2">developing those skills and have</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.890" end="00:03:39.260" style="s2">responsibility so that they can you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.140" end="00:03:42.799" style="s2">if it&#39;s if there&#39;s a thing that comes up</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.260" end="00:03:45.890" style="s2">and we need to organize then the most</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.799" end="00:03:49.340" style="s2">competent person in that domain can step</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.890" end="00:03:53.989" style="s2">up and take the leadership and then you</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.340" end="00:03:56.000" style="s2">know lead the group and yeah yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.989" end="00:03:59.030" style="s2">yeah so I yeah I guess part of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.000" end="00:04:02.780" style="s2">challenge will be figuring out what has</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.030" end="00:04:06.170" style="s2">group we can go out and go there are a</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.780" end="00:04:07.700" style="s2">couple of ideas but yeah but it&#39;s yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.170" end="00:04:10.310" style="s2">they&#39;ve been the balance between finding</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.700" end="00:04:14.780" style="s2">things that are useful and finding</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.310" end="00:04:17.209" style="s2">things that are fondant injuries it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.780" end="00:04:18.890" style="s2">there so where are you in this process</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.209" end="00:04:21.019" style="s2">do you have a group and you&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.890" end="00:04:23.300" style="s2">for things to do or you&#39;re looking to</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.019" end="00:04:26.500" style="s2">start the group or you want things to do</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.300" end="00:04:26.500" style="s2">before you recruit the group</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.900" end="00:04:35.419" style="s2">so I have a small group that we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.889" end="00:04:37.250" style="s2">started practicing yet I have one of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.419" end="00:04:40.639" style="s2">people in the group who I&#39;m gonna have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.250" end="00:04:44.570" style="s2">conversation with sometimes so and just</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.639" end="00:04:46.130" style="s2">to lay out all of the details and get</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.570" end="00:04:51.410" style="s2">her thoughts on them</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.130" end="00:04:53.020" style="s2">I initially spoke to her a while ago</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.410" end="00:04:56.990" style="s2">just saying that I was concerned about</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.020" end="00:04:58.850" style="s2">you know the trajectory of things and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.990" end="00:05:02.600" style="s2">was like we need to come up with some</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.850" end="00:05:07.310" style="s2">kind of solution so that we can you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.600" end="00:05:09.919" style="s2">whether the future better and she said</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.310" end="00:05:18.470" style="s2">that she&#39;s you know people thinking same</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.919" end="00:05:20.330" style="s2">sorts of things so yeah I mean because I</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.470" end="00:05:23.289" style="s2">have a lot of ideas but it also depends</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.330" end="00:05:26.660" style="s2">on what other people are interested in</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.289" end="00:05:28.039" style="s2">yeah but yeah in any kind of feedback</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.660" end="00:05:33.889" style="s2">any kind of thought could be would be</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.039" end="00:05:35.840" style="s2">good I know it&#39;s I can figure out we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.889" end="00:05:37.370" style="s2">brainstorm we can do both really but</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.840" end="00:05:42.080" style="s2">like brainstorm how you find those</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.370" end="00:05:44.330" style="s2">people or we can also brainstorm some of</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.080" end="00:05:46.820" style="s2">those activities that are both useful</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.330" end="00:05:51.080" style="s2">and enjoyable to do or ways to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.820" end="00:05:55.060" style="s2">co-create them um or any other thing you</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.080" end="00:06:02.169" style="s2">would like us to work on for the project</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.060" end="00:06:05.300" style="s2">hmm yeah so so I think in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.169" end="00:06:08.780" style="s2">the growth of the group I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.300" end="00:06:10.250" style="s2">that&#39;ll be too difficult but the key is</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.780" end="00:06:13.970" style="s2">really to call it slowly in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.250" end="00:06:17.570" style="s2">beginning to really yeah get the culture</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.970" end="00:06:19.610" style="s2">locked in but activities yeah maybe</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.570" end="00:06:23.780" style="s2">brainstorm some ideas about things that</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.610" end="00:06:25.160" style="s2">we can actually go out and do it alright</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.780" end="00:06:27.889" style="s2">that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.160" end="00:06:31.270" style="s2">and you&#39;re looking to do these meetings</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.889" end="00:06:33.400" style="s2">how often are they every week everybody</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.270" end="00:06:36.050" style="s2">yeah so at the moment I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.400" end="00:06:39.559" style="s2">weekly but it might be better to the</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.050" end="00:06:43.039" style="s2">sort of twice a week</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.559" end="00:06:45.049" style="s2">sorry what twice every month and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.039" end="00:06:46.249" style="s2">you want to mop it depends like we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.049" end="00:06:48.129" style="s2">have to play around with the potency</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.249" end="00:06:50.809" style="s2">just to make sure that it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.129" end="00:06:55.129" style="s2">interesting yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.809" end="00:06:56.749" style="s2">is it um just four at a project raising</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.129" end="00:06:58.209" style="s2">and part of what inspired the project</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.749" end="00:07:00.559" style="s2">raising was the idea of a barn raising</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.209" end="00:07:05.299" style="s2">right where all of your neighbors come</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.559" end="00:07:06.529" style="s2">and help you raise a barn and then when</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.299" end="00:07:09.589" style="s2">you need a barn raise theoretically</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.529" end="00:07:11.869" style="s2">there to help you would it interest you</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.589" end="00:07:14.719" style="s2">to do something like that where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.869" end="00:07:19.369" style="s2">actually putting a call out to neighbors</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.719" end="00:07:23.899" style="s2">on like what do you need done right a</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.369" end="00:07:26.389" style="s2">paint brush fence painted a garden</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.899" end="00:07:31.279" style="s2">started and so that&#39;s also a way to like</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.389" end="00:07:34.909" style="s2">find new people but also to like focus</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.279" end="00:07:37.159" style="s2">on one person&#39;s project right the issue</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.909" end="00:07:39.439" style="s2">is that just like this you might have</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.159" end="00:07:41.119" style="s2">more people interested in being the</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.439" end="00:07:43.339" style="s2">person having their friends painted the</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.119" end="00:07:45.589" style="s2">necessarily painting other offenses but</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.339" end="00:07:47.179" style="s2">if depending on who those people are</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.589" end="00:07:49.069" style="s2">right if they&#39;re seniors if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.179" end="00:07:52.849" style="s2">young parents people who really need</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.069" end="00:07:53.989" style="s2">that then I think it would feel good to</p>

<p begin="00:09:58.260" end="00:10:02.310" style="s2">know this I know this sounds trivial and</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.790" end="00:10:03.150" style="s2">mundane but is there anything I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.310" end="00:10:04.530" style="s2">don&#39;t know how well you know your</p>

<p begin="00:10:04.530" end="00:10:08.220" style="s2">needs doing in the immediate environment</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.300" end="00:10:09.600" style="s2">a creek that needs cleaning up a pond</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.220" end="00:10:10.950" style="s2">that needs putting a bomb that needs</p>

<p begin="00:10:18.089" end="00:10:27.900" style="s2">it seems to me at that level right hmm</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.170" end="00:10:30.540" style="s2">yeah I mean yeah that is that is</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.900" end="00:10:31.950" style="s2">something that I can do but I think that</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.540" end="00:10:36.330" style="s2">the thing that I&#39;m really interested in</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.950" end="00:10:40.100" style="s2">is just the the forming those bonds with</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.330" end="00:10:43.400" style="s2">a group of people who are interested</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.100" end="00:10:49.529" style="s2">initially in the concept because I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.400" end="00:10:51.450" style="s2">the neighbors either side sort of yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.529" end="00:11:01.920" style="s2">mean I fight I work with my neighbor</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.450" end="00:11:04.080" style="s2">over that way but yeah it&#39;s just yeah</p>

<p begin="00:11:04.080" end="00:11:08.790" style="s2">something that&#39;s been troubling me a lot</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.810" end="00:11:11.610" style="s2">Achille recently in trouble it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.790" end="00:11:14.520" style="s2">troubling me a lot recently is that you</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.610" end="00:11:16.440" style="s2">know we we we try and find a group of</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.520" end="00:11:18.240" style="s2">people with whom we share ideas so that</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.440" end="00:11:21.270" style="s2">we can explore ideas about how to build</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.240" end="00:11:23.279" style="s2">better communities and yet what&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.270" end="00:11:25.740" style="s2">outside of our front door we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.279" end="00:11:27.450" style="s2">now I know and this is me I mean I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.740" end="00:11:29.430" style="s2">trying to put this on it but this is I</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.450" end="00:11:33.450" style="s2">feel this a lot that you know what</p>

<p begin="00:11:33.450" end="00:11:35.580" style="s2">little bit tangled up in a thought here</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.620" end="00:11:36.900" style="s2">but you wander do you understand what</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.580" end="00:11:38.490" style="s2">I&#39;m saying there&#39;s a there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.900" end="00:11:41.460" style="s2">immediacy in a directness that we seem</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.490" end="00:11:44.670" style="s2">to be losing in in all of this talking</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.460" end="00:11:46.950" style="s2">about it does that make sense yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.670" end="00:11:49.680" style="s2">for sure for sure I mean we&#39;ve got yoga</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.950" end="00:12:00.270" style="s2">Gardens right here so we can we continue</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.680" end="00:12:01.560" style="s2">to there yeah sorry correct me if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.270" end="00:12:03.690" style="s2">wrong but you&#39;re you&#39;re trying to find</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.560" end="00:12:05.279" style="s2">groups of people that you can by</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.690" end="00:12:06.570" style="s2">alternate have a conversation about what</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.279" end="00:12:08.490" style="s2">we&#39;re going to do and then go out and do</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.570" end="00:12:10.020" style="s2">a thing right and I and I really applaud</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.490" end="00:12:12.330" style="s2">that that gap between talking about</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.020" end="00:12:14.730" style="s2">doing stuff and actually doing stuff is</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.330" end="00:12:18.210" style="s2">is is is is one that we really do need</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.730" end="00:12:19.800" style="s2">to really do need to bridge but is it</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.210" end="00:12:21.570" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s basically it right get</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.800" end="00:12:23.070" style="s2">together talk about doing something do</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.570" end="00:12:25.110" style="s2">the thing then get back together talk</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.070" end="00:12:26.790" style="s2">about it how did it go how can we build</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.110" end="00:12:29.160" style="s2">on it do the next things that that</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.790" end="00:12:31.080" style="s2">basically the idea oh yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.160" end="00:12:34.950" style="s2">definitely more complicated than that so</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.080" end="00:12:37.050" style="s2">the conversations I want people to</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.950" end="00:12:39.060" style="s2">really get a sense of what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.050" end="00:12:41.190" style="s2">in the world because I think a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.060" end="00:12:44.100" style="s2">people could have think about this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.190" end="00:12:46.230" style="s2">but they distract themselves a lot and I</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.100" end="00:12:48.480" style="s2">think we really need to sort of build up</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.230" end="00:12:51.750" style="s2">a group picture of where things are</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.480" end="00:12:54.420" style="s2">going I think my primary aversion to</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.750" end="00:13:00.240" style="s2">going out and talking to my neighbors</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.420" end="00:13:05.400" style="s2">about the stuff like is just it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.240" end="00:13:07.290" style="s2">the it&#39;s just the scope of what needs to</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.400" end="00:13:09.930" style="s2">be talked about I don&#39;t think I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.290" end="00:13:11.730" style="s2">think I can just rob my neighbors and to</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.930" end="00:13:13.050" style="s2">like are going out and helping them with</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.730" end="00:13:15.600" style="s2">with things that they need help with</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.050" end="00:13:19.320" style="s2">yeah that can be a thing but it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.600" end="00:13:20.300" style="s2">conversation stuff you know I I feel</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.320" end="00:13:22.520" style="s2">like especially</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.300" end="00:13:28.030" style="s2">and I think it&#39;s a thing that my</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.520" end="00:13:30.620" style="s2">generation is stuck with quite a lot is</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.030" end="00:13:34.070" style="s2">so I&#39;m trying to reach out to people my</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.620" end="00:13:45.680" style="s2">age at the moment so we&#39;ve got some kind</p>

<p begin="00:14:27.260" end="00:14:34.130" style="s2">do but for practices that get you to you</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.660" end="00:14:36.470" style="s2">want a group that has a practice that</p>

<p begin="00:14:36.470" end="00:14:41.330" style="s2">part of that is doing actual projects</p>

<p begin="00:15:00.790" end="00:15:07.160" style="s2">walking around or sitting and when you</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.920" end="00:15:09.950" style="s2">feel called to speak you speak and so no</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.160" end="00:15:11.420" style="s2">one has a sermon no one had you know you</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.950" end="00:15:13.220" style="s2">don&#39;t come with something prepared it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.420" end="00:15:15.950" style="s2">just like as you feel called to speak</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.220" end="00:15:18.230" style="s2">you speak and then it goes back to</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.950" end="00:15:20.120" style="s2">silence and that sounds like a really</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.230" end="00:15:24.500" style="s2">beautiful form of group meditation but</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.120" end="00:15:27.710" style="s2">also kind of a way to almost come up</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.500" end="00:15:29.810" style="s2">with an idea for what you do together</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.710" end="00:15:33.320" style="s2">right you like get people together and</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.810" end="00:15:33.910" style="s2">have a brainstorming session with a loud</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.320" end="00:15:37.060" style="s2">silent</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.910" end="00:15:40.390" style="s2">of like meditation with hey this is what</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.060" end="00:15:42.100" style="s2">came up for me and I feel like that</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.390" end="00:15:43.840" style="s2">might be the best of both worlds because</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.100" end="00:15:45.660" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna be like if you&#39;re in that</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.840" end="00:15:47.860" style="s2">room and someone comes up with an idea</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.660" end="00:15:50.500" style="s2">you already feel like you&#39;re part of</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.860" end="00:15:53.740" style="s2">that idea and are gonna be more likely</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.500" end="00:15:55.120" style="s2">to want to to do that and then generate</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.740" end="00:15:58.150" style="s2">something for someone else right hey my</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.120" end="00:16:01.240" style="s2">grandma needs her friends painted my you</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.150" end="00:16:04.180" style="s2">know like having I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.240" end="00:16:06.460" style="s2">know if that&#39;s that lens with you yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.180" end="00:16:09.870" style="s2">yeah I do like that I did I mean I was</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.460" end="00:16:12.930" style="s2">thinking there is probably things</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.870" end="00:16:15.670" style="s2">there&#39;s often a network already set up</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.930" end="00:16:19.540" style="s2">in terms of you know people need help</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.670" end="00:16:21.970" style="s2">for this and that and the other so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.540" end="00:16:24.010" style="s2">a case of just uncovering it and then</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.970" end="00:16:27.730" style="s2">you know finding it had it to become a</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.010" end="00:16:32.980" style="s2">part of it so yeah I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll find</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.730" end="00:16:34.750" style="s2">that as a group yeah and I like I like</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.980" end="00:16:36.310" style="s2">the sound of that practice I think that</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.750" end="00:16:46.600" style="s2">would be quite an interesting thing to</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.310" end="00:16:48.880" style="s2">do and another group yeah yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.600" end="00:16:53.890" style="s2">just trying a lot of different things</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.880" end="00:17:00.040" style="s2">and filling out what makes sense to the</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.890" end="00:17:04.450" style="s2">group and keeping things fresh because</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.040" end="00:17:08.860" style="s2">really sorry I can take it yeah because</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.450" end="00:17:10.150" style="s2">I mean I think the idea is just yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.860" end="00:17:14.500" style="s2">think the idea is just to keep us</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.150" end="00:17:16.780" style="s2">talking so that we can process things</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.500" end="00:17:19.060" style="s2">because it&#39;s hard to just pick a topic</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.780" end="00:17:23.320" style="s2">and then work through all of the areas</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.060" end="00:17:26.410" style="s2">of their topic touches or to try to</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.320" end="00:17:30.280" style="s2">intentionally get the thing that needs</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.410" end="00:17:32.500" style="s2">to be expressed out here because people</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.280" end="00:17:41.230" style="s2">don&#39;t always work in a straightforward</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.500" end="00:17:43.990" style="s2">way like that which I&#39;m wondering have</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.230" end="00:17:46.870" style="s2">you experimented at all with with</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.990" end="00:17:49.179" style="s2">minghao calm</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.870" end="00:17:52.690" style="s2">me yeah yeah yeah yeah I&#39;ve been to a</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.179" end="00:17:54.669" style="s2">couple of different meetups yeah I was</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.690" end="00:17:59.470" style="s2">originally I was originally gonna start</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.669" end="00:18:03.299" style="s2">a meetup around this but I think framing</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.470" end="00:18:05.380" style="s2">the group is quite a difficult thing oh</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.299" end="00:18:08.110" style="s2">that was the thing you&#39;re sending out to</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.380" end="00:18:10.059" style="s2">me as well the difficulty with framing</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.110" end="00:18:14.380" style="s2">because you want to sort of have the</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.059" end="00:18:17.940" style="s2">filter of the people coming in that are</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.380" end="00:18:20.049" style="s2">actually on this on the same page as you</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.940" end="00:18:21.669" style="s2">but also at the same time have</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.049" end="00:18:24.309" style="s2">information about what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.669" end="00:18:27.909" style="s2">getting out widely enough that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.309" end="00:18:29.380" style="s2">sustainable group um I was going I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.909" end="00:18:32.320" style="s2">seen some really good ins I&#39;m really bad</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.380" end="00:18:37.149" style="s2">we come together on meetup.com and it</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.320" end="00:18:39.870" style="s2">does seem could be very much about how</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.149" end="00:18:42.460" style="s2">well the purpose of the group is defined</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.870" end="00:18:44.860" style="s2">that make difference as to whether it</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.460" end="00:18:57.730" style="s2">works or not but yeah if you&#39;ve seen it</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.860" end="00:19:00.070" style="s2">all that was my input yeah my internet</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.730" end="00:19:03.010" style="s2">is very leggy so I can&#39;t really talk too</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.070" end="00:19:07.120" style="s2">much during this cos I interrupt people</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.010" end="00:19:08.620" style="s2">that the leg it&#39;s even worse but I guess</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.120" end="00:19:11.850" style="s2">I&#39;m just looking for more guidance as to</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.620" end="00:19:15.330" style="s2">what you want from us Richie like um</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.850" end="00:19:21.190" style="s2">what you would like us to focus on</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.330" end="00:19:24.929" style="s2">because well does anyone got any</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.190" end="00:19:24.929" style="s2">experience doing something so much of us</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.289" end="00:19:32.710" style="s2">not like in person but it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.630" end="00:19:35.830" style="s2">there&#39;s actually a fair amount of</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.710" end="00:19:37.419" style="s2">overlap with this session with the like</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.830" end="00:19:40.450" style="s2">trying to create a community of people</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.419" end="00:19:41.799" style="s2">whereas it&#39;s not an in-person thing like</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.450" end="00:19:43.720" style="s2">you know cleaning up a creek or painting</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.799" end="00:19:45.270" style="s2">a fence but in this case it&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.720" end="00:19:50.049" style="s2">raise you know project and figure it out</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.270" end="00:19:54.669" style="s2">together and what I think I&#39;m hearing</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.049" end="00:19:56.049" style="s2">like the the friction is right now with</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.669" end="00:19:58.630" style="s2">the de project it sounds like the</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.049" end="00:20:00.519" style="s2">project is more about - framework around</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.630" end="00:20:02.950" style="s2">the group and like what</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.519" end="00:20:04.959" style="s2">the agreed-upon rules and you know how</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.950" end="00:20:07.479" style="s2">do we decide who the leader is that sort</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.959" end="00:20:10.059" style="s2">of thing rather than the group showing</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.479" end="00:20:12.909" style="s2">and doing the thing right whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.059" end="00:20:14.739" style="s2">painting events or cleaning up a creek</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.909" end="00:20:16.419" style="s2">it&#39;s news like that activity is</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.739" end="00:20:18.309" style="s2">partially to give the group of reasons</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.419" end="00:20:20.769" style="s2">but then partially also to act as a test</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.309" end="00:20:22.659" style="s2">of that framework like if we build a</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.769" end="00:20:25.149" style="s2">group you think this framework can they</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.659" end="00:20:26.679" style="s2">go out and paint a fence or does it fall</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.149" end="00:20:30.249" style="s2">apart because you know two people are</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.679" end="00:20:31.779" style="s2">trying to be a leader and so it seems</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.249" end="00:20:33.339" style="s2">like it&#39;s the question of do you build</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.779" end="00:20:35.349" style="s2">the group first and then try to see</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.339" end="00:20:37.719" style="s2">where you can you know apply principles</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.349" end="00:20:40.149" style="s2">of a framework and like add a single</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.719" end="00:20:41.499" style="s2">rule to the group try to emphasize it</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.149" end="00:20:44.019" style="s2">try to get buy-in and see how how the</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.499" end="00:20:46.839" style="s2">group reacts with felt the group already</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.019" end="00:20:49.419" style="s2">being there to build that framework if</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.839" end="00:20:50.529" style="s2">that makes sense like you start with the</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.419" end="00:20:52.239" style="s2">group and you&#39;re the only one trying to</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.529" end="00:20:56.529" style="s2">build the framework to start with you</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.239" end="00:20:58.359" style="s2">see who is open to it versus trying to</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.529" end="00:21:00.099" style="s2">say I only want to build this group</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.359" end="00:21:01.779" style="s2">around people who want to put that</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.099" end="00:21:03.549" style="s2">framework in or trying to answer</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.779" end="00:21:08.019" style="s2">questions about how you build that kind</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.549" end="00:21:09.669" style="s2">of a community wish to me it seems super</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.019" end="00:21:13.629" style="s2">useful but also hard to explain in a way</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.669" end="00:21:16.359" style="s2">that like causes people to go and do</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.629" end="00:21:17.979" style="s2">something and join and add in as opposed</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.359" end="00:21:20.829" style="s2">to there is an immediate call to action</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.979" end="00:21:23.109" style="s2">to a group around hey let&#39;s go clean up</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.829" end="00:21:25.209" style="s2">that Creek or starting a meetup comm</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.109" end="00:21:27.519" style="s2">group off of something like that and</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.209" end="00:21:30.099" style="s2">then you&#39;re there trying to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.519" end="00:21:32.649" style="s2">answer such questions figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.099" end="00:21:34.239" style="s2">that framework might look like and for</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.649" end="00:21:37.749" style="s2">lack of a better term kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.239" end="00:21:39.429" style="s2">trying to take over or have two reasons</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.749" end="00:21:40.799" style="s2">for the group to operate at once if that</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.429" end="00:21:44.799" style="s2">makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.799" end="00:21:46.329" style="s2">mmm one for the the purpose of the the</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.799" end="00:21:48.219" style="s2">activity and then the other one for</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.329" end="00:21:50.079" style="s2">trying to figure out what makes this</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.219" end="00:21:52.479" style="s2">group work what&#39;s the the framework that</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.079" end="00:21:54.609" style="s2">we all say hey us all agreeing on these</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.479" end="00:21:58.929" style="s2">rules seems to work but if we add this</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.609" end="00:22:00.399" style="s2">rule it falls apart hmm yeah I think it</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.929" end="00:22:03.279" style="s2">really depends on the character of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.399" end="00:22:05.049" style="s2">group as as we started so the people</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.279" end="00:22:08.679" style="s2">that I&#39;m starting the group with I know</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.049" end="00:22:10.599" style="s2">fairly well already right so I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.679" end="00:22:13.719" style="s2">it&#39;ll be a case tapping into their</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.599" end="00:22:14.110" style="s2">interests and then how many people I</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.719" end="00:22:22.179" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.110" end="00:22:26.830" style="s2">expand its so there&#39;s like about five</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.179" end="00:22:29.580" style="s2">that are likely to show up and in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.830" end="00:22:31.779" style="s2">first session they&#39;re about 15 who are</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.580" end="00:22:35.380" style="s2">you know within the group because I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.779" end="00:22:37.210" style="s2">started a Facebook or so and you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.380" end="00:22:40.120" style="s2">I&#39;ve invited a bunch of people and that</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.210" end="00:22:42.159" style="s2">sort of thing but yeah I expect to have</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.120" end="00:22:46.500" style="s2">about five or six people in the first</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.159" end="00:22:48.610" style="s2">session and then I think it&#39;ll just be</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.500" end="00:22:50.440" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m trying to I&#39;m trying to trigger</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.610" end="00:22:53.409" style="s2">but I think I&#39;m gonna start with the why</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.440" end="00:22:55.510" style="s2">like why is it it&#39;s feeding any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.409" end="00:22:58.960" style="s2">time trying to build a culture trying to</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.510" end="00:23:02.169" style="s2">build a community right and I think I</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.960" end="00:23:06.010" style="s2">think like I have the sense that the in</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.169" end="00:23:07.990" style="s2">the zeitgeist of at least my generation</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.010" end="00:23:13.899" style="s2">and probably probably wider than that</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.990" end="00:23:16.029" style="s2">that things are coming undone and you</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.899" end="00:23:22.409" style="s2">know I don&#39;t want to go to down too far</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.029" end="00:23:24.250" style="s2">down the kind of the security rote but I</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.409" end="00:23:26.760" style="s2">think there&#39;s a positive and a negative</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.250" end="00:23:32.320" style="s2">vision that is worth sharing with people</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.760" end="00:23:33.130" style="s2">and and then it&#39;s like well what do we</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.320" end="00:23:36.220" style="s2">want to do about it</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.130" end="00:23:38.889" style="s2">given that we are in this scenario where</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.220" end="00:23:41.380" style="s2">we could you know let things slip and</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.889" end="00:23:43.289" style="s2">things could go really badly or we could</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.380" end="00:23:48.070" style="s2">try and work together and try to</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.289" end="00:23:51.610" style="s2">reinvigorate a mode of being that is</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.070" end="00:23:54.190" style="s2">that is natural to two people working</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.610" end="00:24:05.500" style="s2">together as a team having strong bonds</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.190" end="00:24:11.470" style="s2">and connections yeah sort of thing but I</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.500" end="00:24:13.570" style="s2">think I think yeah I think having</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.470" end="00:24:15.070" style="s2">someone because I&#39;m hoping that the</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.570" end="00:24:20.710" style="s2">conversation that I that I have with</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.070" end="00:24:23.139" style="s2">this this other person is know brings a</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.710" end="00:24:25.480" style="s2">parallax to the group because I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.139" end="00:24:28.150" style="s2">I&#39;m pretty bad at explaining that sort</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.480" end="00:24:33.700" style="s2">of stuff because it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.150" end="00:24:36.010" style="s2">in scope so hopefully she can help me</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.700" end="00:24:43.990" style="s2">refine there before we go into the</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.010" end="00:24:46.510" style="s2">physician if you had to pick one thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.990" end="00:24:48.390" style="s2">what would be the primary goal of yes is</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.510" end="00:24:51.040" style="s2">it is it culture building is it</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.390" end="00:24:53.350" style="s2">conversations is it sense making is it</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.040" end="00:24:55.540" style="s2">doing stuff in the real world what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.350" end="00:24:57.240" style="s2">though what&#39;s the core what&#39;s the core</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.540" end="00:25:02.260" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.240" end="00:25:04.390" style="s2">well it&#39;s culture building it&#39;s it&#39;s but</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.260" end="00:25:06.600" style="s2">I mean that dead itself is not a</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.390" end="00:25:10.420" style="s2">specific thing that&#39;s that&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.600" end="00:25:11.950" style="s2">pretty broad those knew what cultural</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.420" end="00:25:19.840" style="s2">building might look by kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.950" end="00:25:27.190" style="s2">that that is that reasonable yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.840" end="00:25:29.350" style="s2">suppose yeah it&#39;s just prototyping like</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.190" end="00:25:33.310" style="s2">how to actually get something like that</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.350" end="00:25:34.720" style="s2">moving and how to actually touch on the</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.310" end="00:25:36.070" style="s2">things that I think are really important</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.720" end="00:25:38.200" style="s2">so I think philosophy is really</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.070" end="00:25:41.410" style="s2">important I think ethics is really</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.200" end="00:25:44.740" style="s2">important I think since making is really</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.410" end="00:25:48.490" style="s2">important and I just want to find a</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.740" end="00:25:51.100" style="s2">quantity in which we can dig into those</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.490" end="00:25:53.830" style="s2">things into enough enough dicks so that</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.100" end="00:25:59.380" style="s2">we develop them as serious skills it</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.830" end="00:26:03.790" style="s2">builds serious connections yeah and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.380" end="00:26:07.320" style="s2">kind of that&#39;s the primary focus Richie</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.790" end="00:26:14.980" style="s2">have you read the micro solidarity stuff</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.320" end="00:26:17.920" style="s2">in the game bSpace i I&#39;ve seen it I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.980" end="00:26:20.170" style="s2">not sure if I&#39;ve read it done oh no I</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.920" end="00:26:23.050" style="s2">think I have it&#39;s just like a one page</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.170" end="00:26:26.800" style="s2">then it&#39;s short it&#39;s me I believe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.050" end="00:26:28.420" style="s2">an entire website I believe the guy&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.800" end="00:26:38.770" style="s2">name is Richard right it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.420" end="00:26:40.480" style="s2">other Richard owes a lot of stuff people</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.770" end="00:26:42.030" style="s2">doesn&#39;t even have micro solidarity</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.480" end="00:26:44.880" style="s2">seriously</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.030" end="00:26:49.299" style="s2">come on okay I&#39;ll send you to stop after</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.880" end="00:26:51.460" style="s2">hmm if you would like yeah that seems to</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.299" end="00:26:53.440" style="s2">be like his eye it&#39;s been so long since</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.460" end="00:26:53.710" style="s2">I&#39;ve read it was so long been a month</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.440" end="00:26:57.610" style="s2">ago</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.710" end="00:26:59.140" style="s2">yeah Breen um did he has a framework for</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.610" end="00:27:02.650" style="s2">like getting a group of people together</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.140" end="00:27:04.450" style="s2">and having them work on a project but</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.650" end="00:27:06.070" style="s2">that is part of the the framework is</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.450" end="00:27:08.230" style="s2">like how many people I think he says</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.070" end="00:27:10.809" style="s2">like seven is ideal and having them work</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.230" end="00:27:13.510" style="s2">through resiliency it&#39;s more about group</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.809" end="00:27:15.370" style="s2">resiliency like um I think from his</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.510" end="00:27:16.750" style="s2">sides maybe that&#39;s not but I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.370" end="00:27:20.980" style="s2">there&#39;s something in there</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.750" end="00:27:22.570" style="s2">or for your project as well yeah yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.980" end="00:27:24.580" style="s2">think I think he talks about how you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.570" end="00:27:26.110" style="s2">got like a single individual then you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.580" end="00:27:28.090" style="s2">got a group of three into the jewels and</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.110" end="00:27:30.010" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a group of seven and then you</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.090" end="00:27:32.500" style="s2">can sort of like it scales up and you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.010" end="00:27:36.640" style="s2">got different yeah optimal for different</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.500" end="00:27:37.270" style="s2">types of things something something to</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.640" end="00:27:42.400" style="s2">that effect</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.270" end="00:27:45.309" style="s2">yeah yeah I mean I think there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.400" end="00:27:47.350" style="s2">of stuff out there like this and just I</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.309" end="00:27:49.900" style="s2">guess my approach is just to go in there</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.350" end="00:27:53.140" style="s2">and try and feel it out as best as</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.900" end="00:27:56.710" style="s2">possible I think they just do to my</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.140" end="00:27:58.990" style="s2">learning style and there&#39;s just so many</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.710" end="00:28:01.090" style="s2">nuances that will be you know that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.990" end="00:28:06.030" style="s2">particular characteristic of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.090" end="00:28:13.360" style="s2">individuals you know the the context</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.030" end="00:28:17.080" style="s2">yeah and I think you know if if this</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.360" end="00:28:19.530" style="s2">initial stab at building that the</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.080" end="00:28:23.049" style="s2">culture doesn&#39;t work I think it&#39;ll mean</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.530" end="00:28:24.850" style="s2">trying to find people who are more</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.049" end="00:28:27.940" style="s2">specifically interested in this like</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.850" end="00:28:33.250" style="s2">we&#39;ve got a game B group that sitting up</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.940" end="00:28:35.559" style="s2">with which could be another 42 staff for</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.250" end="00:28:38.679" style="s2">it so it&#39;s kind of people who are</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.559" end="00:28:39.880" style="s2">already in the know to some extent and I</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.679" end="00:28:44.919" style="s2">think it&#39;s a lot easier to build</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.880" end="00:28:47.950" style="s2">something or to start running as a group</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.919" end="00:28:49.750" style="s2">and then finding that momentum because</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.950" end="00:28:51.190" style="s2">it really is having that foundational</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.750" end="00:28:53.559" style="s2">knowledge that I think is a motivating</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.190" end="00:28:54.560" style="s2">factor to keep us showing this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.559" end="00:28:56.900" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.560" end="00:28:59.300" style="s2">like we wouldn&#39;t all be here if we</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.900" end="00:29:02.560" style="s2">didn&#39;t understand what the facts were</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.300" end="00:29:10.750" style="s2">and what the situation is to some extent</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.560" end="00:29:13.130" style="s2">so I think yeah it&#39;s about finding that</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.750" end="00:29:14.750" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m just I&#39;m just testing things I</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.130" end="00:29:15.170" style="s2">haven&#39;t really done anything like this</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.750" end="00:29:17.300" style="s2">before</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.170" end="00:29:20.120" style="s2">but it seems really important to me</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.300" end="00:29:22.130" style="s2">because you know I think John vivace is</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.120" end="00:29:23.720" style="s2">really onto something with its concept</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.130" end="00:29:27.230" style="s2">of the religion it&#39;s not a religion I</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.720" end="00:29:41.840" style="s2">think we need some kind of cultural</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.230" end="00:29:44.240" style="s2">bonding framework or frameworks yeah we</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.840" end="00:29:45.590" style="s2">am I sent out at least two Adriel I</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.240" end="00:29:46.940" style="s2">think I sent it to Kylie as well</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.590" end="00:29:48.290" style="s2">probably not Derek but I think we also</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.940" end="00:29:53.210" style="s2">talked for an ER major group so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.290" end="00:29:57.910" style="s2">the Brett Weinstein Weinstein talk the</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.210" end="00:30:02.180" style="s2">one that you had had sent on the fourth</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.910" end="00:30:06.410" style="s2">to call it I had the name rings on the</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.180" end="00:30:07.880" style="s2">4th frontier yeah I don&#39;t know if you</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.410" end="00:30:09.770" style="s2">want to talk about that we can chat</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.880" end="00:30:11.540" style="s2">about that and what it was that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.770" end="00:30:17.810" style="s2">resonated with you around this project</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.540" end="00:30:21.080" style="s2">in particular yeah so I&#39;m just playing</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.810" end="00:30:22.850" style="s2">with this idea at the moment that we</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.080" end="00:30:25.250" style="s2">rather than spending our lives just</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.850" end="00:30:27.230" style="s2">working I think it would be much much</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.250" end="00:30:29.510" style="s2">better for like for people to spend</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.230" end="00:30:33.380" style="s2">their lives doing things that are more</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.510" end="00:30:35.720" style="s2">meaningful for them more community</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.380" end="00:30:39.920" style="s2">orientated like we&#39;ve just got so much</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.720" end="00:30:41.300" style="s2">stuff and we can&#39;t really I&#39;m not I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.920" end="00:30:43.280" style="s2">not sure if it&#39;s entirely true but it</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.300" end="00:30:45.260" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem like we can keep increasing</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.280" end="00:30:47.210" style="s2">the amount of resources that we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:30:47.210" end="00:30:51.140" style="s2">the throwing environments and things</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.530" end="00:30:54.470" style="s2">like that so rather than getting people</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.140" end="00:30:56.660" style="s2">to focus on trying to maximize their</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.470" end="00:30:58.460" style="s2">with the time in order to pay the bills</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.660" end="00:31:01.940" style="s2">and things like that I&#39;m hoping that we</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.460" end="00:31:05.510" style="s2">can find ways to cooperate as</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.940" end="00:31:08.060" style="s2">communities and enjoy our time and doing</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.510" end="00:31:13.100" style="s2">that getting our well worth being from</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.060" end="00:31:15.230" style="s2">from those kind of activities so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.100" end="00:31:26.650" style="s2">their kind of Highlander frontier</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.230" end="00:31:28.520" style="s2">because yeah yeah I mean it&#39;s in there</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.650" end="00:31:30.500" style="s2">yeah there was a lot in there</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.520" end="00:31:34.220" style="s2">he said he condensed like a six month</p>

<p begin="00:31:34.220" end="00:31:37.850" style="s2">end he talks about this engineered</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.020" end="00:31:42.050" style="s2">stable abundance that are no turd for us</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.850" end="00:31:43.550" style="s2">to to be in the better half of our</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.050" end="00:31:44.840" style="s2">genetics we&#39;re we&#39;re in abundance and</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.550" end="00:31:47.930" style="s2">we&#39;re kinder to each other rather than</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.840" end="00:31:49.610" style="s2">when we are we have scarcity and we show</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.930" end="00:31:53.330" style="s2">up a lot less that in order to be able</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.610" end="00:31:55.010" style="s2">to have that peace from humanity we need</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.330" end="00:31:57.830" style="s2">engineered stable abundance so people</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.010" end="00:31:59.630" style="s2">need to feel like they live in an</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.830" end="00:32:01.940" style="s2">abundant peaceful world that&#39;s taking</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.630" end="00:32:03.710" style="s2">care of their needs and it can&#39;t be a</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.940" end="00:32:06.020" style="s2">lie it has to be something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.710" end="00:32:07.730" style="s2">authentically real for them inside and I</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.020" end="00:32:10.490" style="s2">think that you&#39;re onto something huge</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.730" end="00:32:11.990" style="s2">here because it&#39;s like the the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.490" end="00:32:13.850" style="s2">you&#39;re never gonna have enough of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.990" end="00:32:17.030" style="s2">designed so that you it doesn&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.850" end="00:32:18.740" style="s2">fill anything it&#39;s all about you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.030" end="00:32:20.330" style="s2">who and it&#39;s just accumulation our</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.740" end="00:32:22.130" style="s2">planet can&#39;t handle that but our planet</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.330" end="00:32:25.160" style="s2">can absolutely handle the abundance of</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.130" end="00:32:26.740" style="s2">connection and of purpose and doing</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.160" end="00:32:30.620" style="s2">stuff and so the more we can tap into</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.740" end="00:32:33.110" style="s2">that peace for people even if it&#39;s five</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.620" end="00:32:35.180" style="s2">people or seven people if they already</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.110" end="00:32:36.730" style="s2">have that sense of engineered stable</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.180" end="00:32:39.950" style="s2">abundance because they have the</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.730" end="00:32:41.300" style="s2">connections then from that space they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.950" end="00:32:42.590" style="s2">just like a little better off to help</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.300" end="00:32:44.180" style="s2">other people who then are a little</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.590" end="00:32:47.420" style="s2">better off to help other people and</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.180" end="00:32:49.040" style="s2">other people yeah I mean the key is to</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.420" end="00:32:52.850" style="s2">find something that&#39;s satisfying for</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.040" end="00:32:55.580" style="s2">people that&#39;s long term sustainable that</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.850" end="00:32:57.290" style="s2">isn&#39;t yeah just burning throw more and</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.580" end="00:32:58.550" style="s2">more resources because the trouble with</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.290" end="00:33:00.650" style="s2">mooning through more and more resources</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.550" end="00:33:02.630" style="s2">is eventually we&#39;re going to create</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.650" end="00:33:03.980" style="s2">scarcity for ourselves because we would</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.630" end="00:33:06.380" style="s2">have consumed too much of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.980" end="00:33:10.430" style="s2">environment and then we&#39;ll fight other</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.380" end="00:33:13.880" style="s2">nations other people ourselves in order</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.430" end="00:33:17.630" style="s2">to satisfy the the growth and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.880" end="00:33:19.550" style="s2">consumption need it&#39;s just yes really</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.630" end="00:33:21.610" style="s2">I mean potentially the thing is we can</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.550" end="00:33:25.010" style="s2">potentially just</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.610" end="00:33:26.750" style="s2">you know develop technology that can</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.010" end="00:33:29.779" style="s2">just keep going through so we can just</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.750" end="00:33:32.419" style="s2">do do this for another two hundred years</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.779" end="00:33:34.669" style="s2">or something like that but you know it</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.419" end="00:33:40.840" style="s2">seems like if we keep going down the</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.669" end="00:33:43.700" style="s2">technology road the economy and the the</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.840" end="00:33:45.159" style="s2">kind of the nature of society is just</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.700" end="00:33:48.169" style="s2">gonna become more and more brutal</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.159" end="00:33:49.789" style="s2">because like we don&#39;t have an ethical</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.169" end="00:33:52.039" style="s2">framework that we work with them so</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.789" end="00:33:53.809" style="s2">nobody there&#39;s no authority to say</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.039" end="00:33:58.669" style="s2">what&#39;s right and what&#39;s wrong and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.809" end="00:34:02.270" style="s2">real issue you seems to understand at</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.669" end="00:34:08.330" style="s2">the moment we&#39;ll you know fifty hundred</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.270" end="00:34:10.669" style="s2">years time yeah I feel like we already</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.330" end="00:34:12.440" style="s2">know that deep in our deep in ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.669" end="00:34:15.320" style="s2">and that&#39;s where a lot of the unrest</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.440" end="00:34:17.690" style="s2">comes from individually is that we do</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.320" end="00:34:19.730" style="s2">not feel in any way engineered stable</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.690" end="00:34:21.889" style="s2">abundance we do not feel even if we have</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.730" end="00:34:25.720" style="s2">even if we&#39;re what the part of the 1% we</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.889" end="00:34:27.589" style="s2">don&#39;t feel abundant not that I know and</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.720" end="00:34:31.369" style="s2">we don&#39;t feel at peace</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.589" end="00:34:33.889" style="s2">we don&#39;t feel whereas like the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.369" end="00:34:35.629" style="s2">an outside Authority some religion some</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.889" end="00:34:37.580" style="s2">government can dictate to you that you</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.629" end="00:34:39.260" style="s2">need to act better without giving you</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.580" end="00:34:41.720" style="s2">the capacity to be able to act better</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.260" end="00:34:43.730" style="s2">like all we actually have to do is have</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.720" end="00:34:46.520" style="s2">engineered stable abundance because then</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.730" end="00:34:49.609" style="s2">you you just do act better right like</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.520" end="00:34:51.950" style="s2">you you can share with your neighbors</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.609" end="00:34:53.240" style="s2">and be shared with and have trust that</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.950" end="00:34:55.070" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna be taking care of you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.240" end="00:34:58.460" style="s2">need to hoard resources you don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.070" end="00:35:00.410" style="s2">to accumulate things but it can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.460" end="00:35:03.950" style="s2">something that is done from on high like</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.410" end="00:35:08.000" style="s2">it has to be something that is truly</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.950" end="00:35:09.770" style="s2">felt in the individual and to me like</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.000" end="00:35:11.420" style="s2">getting a group of people together and</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.770" end="00:35:13.580" style="s2">asking them like what would help you</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.420" end="00:35:15.500" style="s2">feel more abundance right like right now</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.580" end="00:35:17.750" style="s2">on this planet what not would make you</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.500" end="00:35:20.089" style="s2">feel at complete perfect abundance and</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.750" end="00:35:23.930" style="s2">peace but like what would help you get</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.089" end="00:35:26.780" style="s2">that little bit of extra help so that</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.930" end="00:35:32.000" style="s2">you are able to give more and be more</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.780" end="00:35:34.460" style="s2">and and find those that yeah well I mean</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.000" end="00:35:39.120" style="s2">I think straight away it is just</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.460" end="00:35:42.390" style="s2">building a community will will be so</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.120" end="00:35:47.600" style="s2">satisfying for people just because we</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.390" end="00:35:49.920" style="s2">were really disconnected at these days</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.600" end="00:35:52.140" style="s2">spending a lot of time on Facebook and</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.920" end="00:35:55.950" style="s2">all this kind of stuff so the month the</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.140" end="00:36:00.120" style="s2">meaning crisis sort of has rendered a</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.950" end="00:36:01.620" style="s2">lot of us dissatisfied and depressed and</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.120" end="00:36:04.620" style="s2">all these kinds of things so I think</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.620" end="00:36:08.310" style="s2">just trying to restart those connections</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.620" end="00:36:11.550" style="s2">and and actually address some of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.310" end="00:36:15.560" style="s2">more meaningful things will you know the</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.550" end="00:36:20.190" style="s2">habit own hopefully boost to people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.560" end="00:36:22.590" style="s2">felt experience of things and and I</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.190" end="00:36:24.480" style="s2">think yeah the personal growth just</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.590" end="00:36:29.130" style="s2">going out and doing things and</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.480" end="00:36:32.460" style="s2">challenging yourself and and and just</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.130" end="00:36:35.640" style="s2">being noticed I think that that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.460" end="00:36:39.240" style="s2">thing I&#39;m noticing a lot within people</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.640" end="00:36:43.860" style="s2">is just this this need to be to be seen</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.240" end="00:36:46.980" style="s2">to be recognized to be valued so giving</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.860" end="00:36:48.870" style="s2">people a space to find a niche that they</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.980" end="00:36:51.840" style="s2">can occupy and they can beat that person</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.870" end="00:36:53.250" style="s2">within a community I think people really</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.840" end="00:36:56.010" style="s2">need that because originally the group</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.250" end="00:36:58.080" style="s2">was going to be centered around this</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.010" end="00:37:00.180" style="s2">idea of tell me your story so I was</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.080" end="00:37:02.130" style="s2">gonna go out and start a meetup group</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.180" end="00:37:04.470" style="s2">and people are gonna show up and just</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.130" end="00:37:06.390" style="s2">tell the story that they needed to tell</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.470" end="00:37:08.010" style="s2">because I was noticing a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.390" end="00:37:11.520" style="s2">people in my life were just they were</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.010" end="00:37:13.410" style="s2">just talk and that just tell tell me a</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.520" end="00:37:16.970" style="s2">story about you know whatever it was on</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.410" end="00:37:19.050" style="s2">was that was on the line and I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.970" end="00:37:21.900" style="s2">part of that is just people need to</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.050" end="00:37:23.580" style="s2">process their experience and part of it</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.900" end="00:37:27.450" style="s2">is people need to know that they met it</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.580" end="00:37:28.740" style="s2">to other people and but I bet if I</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.450" end="00:37:30.860" style="s2">didn&#39;t well I talked to a psychologist</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.740" end="00:37:34.140" style="s2">about that particular idea and you see</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.860" end="00:37:35.430" style="s2">it&#39;s probably gonna be pretty risky just</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.140" end="00:37:37.470" style="s2">because you&#39;ll have people turning up</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.430" end="00:37:38.880" style="s2">and they&#39;ll be like cuz this kinda no</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.470" end="00:37:42.680" style="s2">constrains and people just talk and talk</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.880" end="00:37:42.680" style="s2">and talk I mean yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.749" end="00:37:51.369" style="s2">can I just a little bit to this notion</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.059" end="00:37:53.410" style="s2">of abundance because I mean III agree</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.369" end="00:37:55.150" style="s2">with I agree with almost everything Bret</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.410" end="00:38:00.489" style="s2">says but I do think there&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.150" end="00:38:02.499" style="s2">of a danger in that there&#39;s implicit in</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.489" end="00:38:05.380" style="s2">it is kind of this assumption they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.499" end="00:38:08.859" style="s2">assuming that abundance can be</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.380" end="00:38:11.019" style="s2">engineered that that feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.859" end="00:38:13.599" style="s2">emptiness you know that Hungry Ghost</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.019" end="00:38:15.339" style="s2">thing will just go away and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.599" end="00:38:18.819" style="s2">convinced of that I&#39;m not absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.339" end="00:38:21.219" style="s2">convinced their abundance is also a</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.819" end="00:38:23.079" style="s2">place within right I mean yes you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.219" end="00:38:25.299" style="s2">it&#39;s very very difficult to feel</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.079" end="00:38:28.299" style="s2">abundance within when when when you want</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.299" end="00:38:32.529" style="s2">in the real world right but abundance is</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.299" end="00:38:35.259" style="s2">also a place within right once so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.529" end="00:38:38.319" style="s2">slightly leery of this engineered</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.259" end="00:38:39.880" style="s2">abundance being a panacea sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.319" end="00:38:42.339" style="s2">and I&#39;m not saying you say like that but</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.880" end="00:38:45.880" style="s2">I&#39;m saying there&#39;s a danger that can be</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.339" end="00:38:47.170" style="s2">viewed like that hmm yeah I mean one of</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.880" end="00:38:51.640" style="s2">the things that I was thinking about the</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.170" end="00:38:56.319" style="s2">other day is just this idea of the need</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.640" end="00:39:00.339" style="s2">for objective verification and what I</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.319" end="00:39:02.190" style="s2">mean by that is I think no matter how</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.339" end="00:39:06.579" style="s2">much you&#39;re getting positive</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.190" end="00:39:10.779" style="s2">reinforcement from a community I think</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.579" end="00:39:13.960" style="s2">there&#39;s this need to be like wool like</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.779" end="00:39:17.219" style="s2">especially you know if you&#39;re a more</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.960" end="00:39:21.809" style="s2">kind of dominant as a person or more</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.219" end="00:39:21.809" style="s2">competitive you kind of like whoa</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.950" end="00:39:31.270" style="s2">and now I just out compete can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.240" end="00:39:32.859" style="s2">if you want to explain but if you can if</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.270" end="00:39:35.170" style="s2">you can accumulate leverage against</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.859" end="00:39:37.869" style="s2">people by doing a particular thing like</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.170" end="00:39:40.230" style="s2">starting a business so something like</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.869" end="00:39:48.609" style="s2">that people can&#39;t argue with that like</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.230" end="00:39:54.270" style="s2">folks it works and and you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.609" end="00:39:54.270" style="s2">no question that it does work</p>

<p begin="00:40:13.619" end="00:40:16.859" style="s2">been freezing like this I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.329" end="00:40:18.480" style="s2">watching the other panels and like I can</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.859" end="00:40:22.079" style="s2">always see you slightly adjusting here</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.480" end="00:40:23.310" style="s2">so it shows that the all the other band</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.079" end="00:40:25.550" style="s2">at this time and you put your meters</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.310" end="00:40:28.760" style="s2">that are you saying I&#39;m a fidget sir</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.550" end="00:40:31.800" style="s2">probably probably not as much as me I</p>

<p begin="00:40:31.800" end="00:40:42.119" style="s2">and oh okay and that did not work now</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.660" end="00:40:44.430" style="s2">it&#39;s frozen is that&#39;s just nothing wait</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.119" end="00:40:46.829" style="s2">till I see him moving in there and then</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.430" end="00:40:48.240" style="s2">if he comes back and he&#39;s a 15-6 person</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.829" end="00:40:50.880" style="s2">well we&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.240" end="00:40:53.940" style="s2">but as to what you said Eric about the</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.880" end="00:40:57.150" style="s2">abundance I agree that like if all we</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.940" end="00:40:59.220" style="s2">have is resource abundance which is both</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.150" end="00:41:02.280" style="s2">one of the most difficult things to</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.220" end="00:41:05.220" style="s2">obtain and it doesn&#39;t deal with those</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.280" end="00:41:06.780" style="s2">with the shadow it doesn&#39;t deal with but</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.220" end="00:41:09.270" style="s2">not sufficient right is the phrase that</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.780" end="00:41:11.579" style="s2">comes to mind and necessary most yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.270" end="00:41:13.619" style="s2">just why and yet like if we stick with</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.579" end="00:41:15.180" style="s2">the other form of abundance which is</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.619" end="00:41:16.530" style="s2">like the internal abundance the</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.180" end="00:41:19.020" style="s2">abundance of connection and community</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.530" end="00:41:21.960" style="s2">the abundance of like you are seen and</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.020" end="00:41:24.720" style="s2">and respected is the wrong word word</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.960" end="00:41:26.940" style="s2">your seed is worthy for exactly who you</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.720" end="00:41:29.520" style="s2">are as much as we can do that in small</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.940" end="00:41:33.569" style="s2">groups then there&#39;s already that sense</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.520" end="00:41:36.119" style="s2">of via the abundance that does get you</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.569" end="00:41:38.190" style="s2">there the abundance that is eternal</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.119" end="00:41:40.680" style="s2">peace that helps you you grow and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.190" end="00:41:44.190" style="s2">available now that&#39;s not something we</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.680" end="00:41:46.200" style="s2">need to wait till game before starts in</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.190" end="00:41:49.050" style="s2">here right with although all of it</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.200" end="00:41:50.579" style="s2">starts in here yeah yeah absolutely and</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.050" end="00:41:53.369" style="s2">it is for an individual I mean I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.579" end="00:41:56.550" style="s2">reached there mostly for myself but</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.369" end="00:41:58.530" style="s2">there&#39;s a big piece that it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.550" end="00:42:00.750" style="s2">get there by yourself it&#39;s hard to see</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.530" end="00:42:03.720" style="s2">yourself as worthy without other people</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.750" end="00:42:05.250" style="s2">seeing you is worthy yeah yeah and still</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.720" end="00:42:07.349" style="s2">the best thing we can do for other</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.250" end="00:42:10.589" style="s2">people once we&#39;ve went through that</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.349" end="00:42:13.079" style="s2">show is to see them and love them where</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.589" end="00:42:15.000" style="s2">they are so that they don&#39;t have to do</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.079" end="00:42:16.120" style="s2">that journey alone and be lonely they</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.000" end="00:42:18.580" style="s2">already get that sense</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.120" end="00:42:20.410" style="s2">of abundance like you don&#39;t need to love</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.580" end="00:42:25.270" style="s2">you will love you until you can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.410" end="00:42:29.280" style="s2">thing as whatever is that sounds I mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.270" end="00:42:32.380" style="s2">another part of abundance is rather than</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.280" end="00:42:36.040" style="s2">having more is needing less right so</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.380" end="00:42:40.390" style="s2">that that that&#39;s being content with less</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.040" end="00:42:43.000" style="s2">is also a pathway towards abundance</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.390" end="00:42:44.920" style="s2">right absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.000" end="00:42:48.760" style="s2">it&#39;s a pretty important pathway but like</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.920" end="00:42:50.050" style="s2">just like the abundance like if everyone</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.760" end="00:42:52.260" style="s2">around you has a car and everyone around</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.050" end="00:42:54.640" style="s2">you as a house everyone gets going</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.260" end="00:42:56.910" style="s2">there&#39;s that sense of you&#39;re lacking</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.640" end="00:42:58.960" style="s2">right whereas if everyone else is</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.910" end="00:43:00.550" style="s2">starving and you have food on your table</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.960" end="00:43:03.310" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna feel like you have more</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.550" end="00:43:06.400" style="s2">more abundance than they do but that</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.310" end="00:43:08.350" style="s2">isn&#39;t true abundance like that like it</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.400" end="00:43:11.740" style="s2">can&#39;t be compared to other people</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.350" end="00:43:13.840" style="s2">it has to be I&#39;m abundant because I have</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.740" end="00:43:15.340" style="s2">this not because other people don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.840" end="00:43:20.620" style="s2">because I have more or less than someone</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.340" end="00:43:23.830" style="s2">else just I have it and they can to its</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.620" end="00:43:25.840" style="s2">III in fact I even a lack of want is</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.830" end="00:43:27.880" style="s2">even a better word than abundance right</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.840" end="00:43:31.570" style="s2">because it&#39;s not about loads of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.880" end="00:43:33.460" style="s2">it&#39;s just about an absence of fear and</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.570" end="00:43:41.860" style="s2">absence of fear of wanting you know what</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.460" end="00:43:50.110" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s that it&#39;s that yes we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.860" end="00:43:52.060" style="s2">come up again playing we&#39;re done well I</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.110" end="00:43:54.250" style="s2">think the I think is biological reasons</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.060" end="00:43:56.170" style="s2">why we have this kind of what they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.250" end="00:43:58.840" style="s2">got this I should I should have that as</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.170" end="00:44:01.420" style="s2">well but there&#39;s also like if you come</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.840" end="00:44:03.430" style="s2">to an equilibrium then you&#39;ve also got</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.420" end="00:44:06.250" style="s2">this well I feel like I&#39;m better than</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.430" end="00:44:08.050" style="s2">people so I&#39;m gonna I&#39;m gonna try and</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.250" end="00:44:10.090" style="s2">prove that I am better than people and</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.050" end="00:44:13.840" style="s2">then it&#39;s like there&#39;s the step to set</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.090" end="00:44:15.430" style="s2">dissatisfaction against mediocrity that</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.840" end="00:44:19.240" style="s2">so so we&#39;ve got kind of these two</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.430" end="00:44:20.770" style="s2">conflicting drives within a collective</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.240" end="00:44:23.980" style="s2">psyches which I think are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.770" end="00:44:26.800" style="s2">really difficult to mediate because</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.980" end="00:44:29.980" style="s2">we&#39;re going to still need to find ways</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.800" end="00:44:31.780" style="s2">to compete against one another</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.980" end="00:44:35.619" style="s2">the thing is we need to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.780" end="00:44:38.740" style="s2">outlets for these natural impulses that</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.619" end="00:44:42.160" style="s2">don&#39;t lead to going falling back into</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.740" end="00:44:43.890" style="s2">game theory that&#39;s kind of well I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.160" end="00:44:46.780" style="s2">that&#39;s going to be a really difficult</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.890" end="00:44:48.640" style="s2">exactly what sport this for yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.780" end="00:44:53.619" style="s2">you that right sports and games that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.640" end="00:44:58.780" style="s2">exactly what they&#39;re for hmm for me the</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.619" end="00:45:00.910" style="s2">analogy is in the Olympics the Olympics</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.780" end="00:45:03.220" style="s2">has one gold medal winner and everyone</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.910" end="00:45:06.730" style="s2">else is a loser if you are there in your</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.220" end="00:45:08.740" style="s2">sport to only get the gold medal chances</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.730" end="00:45:10.240" style="s2">are you&#39;re not gonna be happy</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.740" end="00:45:11.980" style="s2">whereas if you&#39;re there to compete at</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.240" end="00:45:13.119" style="s2">your best level including you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.980" end="00:45:14.530" style="s2">competing against people right you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.119" end="00:45:17.380" style="s2">not there to get nothing but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.530" end="00:45:19.270" style="s2">there to get like there&#39;s a difference</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.380" end="00:45:22.240" style="s2">between the internal competition of like</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.270" end="00:45:24.849" style="s2">me trying to be my best and if you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:45:58.359" end="00:46:04.510" style="s2">you know that that visceral competition</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.440" end="00:46:05.680" style="s2">in the moment against another human</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.510" end="00:46:07.510" style="s2">being you know what I mean there is no</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.680" end="00:46:09.460" style="s2">substitute for that for that for the</p>

<p begin="00:46:09.460" end="00:46:14.980" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s its harnessing that taking</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.140" end="00:46:17.290" style="s2">the destructive war you know win-lose</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.980" end="00:46:20.079" style="s2">thing out of it that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:46:20.079" end="00:46:25.480" style="s2">yourself as hard as other people in</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.030" end="00:46:26.950" style="s2">competition against you can drive you it</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.480" end="00:46:29.020" style="s2">also gets hard when you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.950" end="00:46:30.609" style="s2">if you&#39;re trying to compete in something</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.020" end="00:46:32.560" style="s2">that you&#39;re good at there&#39;s all these</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.609" end="00:46:34.300" style="s2">different sports like I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.560" end="00:46:36.700" style="s2">compete in basketball oh I think maybe I</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.300" end="00:46:38.829" style="s2">can do long distance running I&#39;ll try</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.700" end="00:46:40.990" style="s2">that but then you get you know people</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.829" end="00:46:43.869" style="s2">like Jeff Bezos and they&#39;re like well</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.990" end="00:46:47.980" style="s2">I&#39;m not good that but I can do</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.869" end="00:46:49.480" style="s2">good at this sort of you know hiring a</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.980" end="00:46:50.740" style="s2">lot of wealth and running a business in</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.480" end="00:46:52.809" style="s2">a certain way and doing some with that</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.740" end="00:46:54.339" style="s2">we&#39;re now that gives him a stage to</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.809" end="00:46:59.259" style="s2">compete on the world stage that&#39;s his</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.339" end="00:47:00.730" style="s2">Olympics and if there is no outlet then</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.259" end="00:47:02.799" style="s2">what do you dislike if Jeff paid you</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.730" end="00:47:04.450" style="s2">know if you know if the next Jeff Bezos</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.799" end="00:47:05.890" style="s2">looks at all the sports in the Olympics</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.450" end="00:47:07.809" style="s2">is this man I don&#39;t want to do any of</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.890" end="00:47:10.599" style="s2">those looks at something that he can do</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.809" end="00:47:14.259" style="s2">that maybe I want to create a grab you</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.599" end="00:47:16.569" style="s2">name just me and see the game that is</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.259" end="00:47:20.440" style="s2">there but that competing in it is</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.569" end="00:47:22.749" style="s2">damaging I think that&#39;s where you you</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.440" end="00:47:24.130" style="s2">ever read like it&#39;s sort of figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.749" end="00:47:26.079" style="s2">right like there might be there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.130" end="00:47:27.369" style="s2">sport of target shooting but maybe we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.079" end="00:47:28.509" style="s2">saying hey maybe we don&#39;t want the sport</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.369" end="00:47:29.920" style="s2">where we&#39;re shooting at people we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.509" end="00:47:30.970" style="s2">gonna agree that that one&#39;s off the</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.920" end="00:47:33.519" style="s2">table because that&#39;s something else</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.970" end="00:47:35.740" style="s2">entirely and it&#39;s talking about where</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.519" end="00:47:37.269" style="s2">we&#39;re agreeing that it&#39;s okay to compete</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.740" end="00:47:39.640" style="s2">here and it and these other areas where</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.269" end="00:47:41.319" style="s2">were like no because in order to get to</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.640" end="00:47:43.359" style="s2">the top and to have that you know if</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.319" end="00:47:45.849" style="s2">you&#39;re competing against someone it</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.359" end="00:47:47.829" style="s2">helps you grow and it was like that the</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.849" end="00:47:49.329" style="s2">picture that they took a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.829" end="00:47:52.140" style="s2">months ago of the person who ran the</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.329" end="00:47:54.730" style="s2">first it was the first under two hour</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.140" end="00:47:56.980" style="s2">marathon or salute or something that</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.730" end="00:47:59.559" style="s2">there was some world record that was</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.980" end="00:48:02.190" style="s2">broken but if you look at the picture</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.559" end="00:48:05.470" style="s2">there&#39;s like six people right behind me</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.190" end="00:48:07.569" style="s2">yeah all competing together it&#39;s moving</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.470" end="00:48:09.400" style="s2">that for everyone which when you get</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.569" end="00:48:12.509" style="s2">into certain sport right like extreme</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.400" end="00:48:14.799" style="s2">capitalism you get into okay but</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.509" end="00:48:17.319" style="s2">everyone competing this and moving this</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.799" end="00:48:21.089" style="s2">up and up and and raising that bar is</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.319" end="00:48:23.739" style="s2">incredibly damaging everywhere else and</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.089" end="00:48:27.579" style="s2">identify that how do we say that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.739" end="00:48:30.279" style="s2">sport that one&#39;s too dangerous you have</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.579" end="00:48:31.630" style="s2">ten minutes left for this session</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.279" end="00:48:33.880" style="s2">Richie&#39;s or anything else you want us to</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.630" end="00:48:47.289" style="s2">concentrate on are you good with just</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.880" end="00:48:49.839" style="s2">having a good the thing that said of</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.289" end="00:48:52.420" style="s2">coming up to me here ISM is around</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.839" end="00:48:54.430" style="s2">feedback so that&#39;s how I understood like</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.420" end="00:48:56.859" style="s2">that engineered abundance to be it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.430" end="00:48:57.490" style="s2">like giving the feedback at that right</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.859" end="00:49:00.130" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.490" end="00:49:03.430" style="s2">which means that you&#39;ve got a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.130" end="00:49:05.290" style="s2">having enough but also not pushing past</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.430" end="00:49:07.540" style="s2">that limit and I think that it might be</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.290" end="00:49:09.160" style="s2">a bit the same with with everything you</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.540" end="00:49:10.540" style="s2">know like in terms of whether you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.160" end="00:49:12.700" style="s2">just trying to compete with you as</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.540" end="00:49:14.740" style="s2">powerful or trying to compete Atlas you</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.700" end="00:49:16.869" style="s2">know out with other people in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.740" end="00:49:18.520" style="s2">Olympics or whatever the case may be</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.869" end="00:49:23.110" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s always about like getting</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.520" end="00:49:25.750" style="s2">the feedback as to as to fitness you</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.110" end="00:49:27.310" style="s2">know like as to how appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.750" end="00:49:30.190" style="s2">something is within a certain</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.310" end="00:49:34.030" style="s2">circumstance actually wondering if in</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.190" end="00:49:36.550" style="s2">some ways this this almost applies for</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.030" end="00:49:38.950" style="s2">what which is looking at doing as well</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.550" end="00:49:42.100" style="s2">is to kind of go you know what is it</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.950" end="00:49:43.960" style="s2">that we can go and do as a group that</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.100" end="00:49:46.030" style="s2">then gives us the feedback to know</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.960" end="00:49:49.750" style="s2">whether this is something that&#39;s healthy</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.030" end="00:49:51.730" style="s2">to have within our cultural setting you</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.750" end="00:49:53.890" style="s2">know unhealthy so it&#39;s almost like going</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.730" end="00:49:56.170" style="s2">and trying something and then reflecting</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.890" end="00:49:58.510" style="s2">on it and doing each other you know the</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.170" end="00:50:01.540" style="s2">feedback to kind of go okay so is this</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.510" end="00:50:04.180" style="s2">making us all feel more abundant or that</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.540" end="00:50:05.770" style="s2">making it feel like we&#39;re missing out on</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.180" end="00:50:07.660" style="s2">things that we&#39;re feeling like it&#39;s fair</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.770" end="00:50:11.500" style="s2">are we feeling like it&#39;s ethical is it</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.660" end="00:50:13.720" style="s2">you know to try to get some of those and</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.500" end="00:50:15.820" style="s2">almost like feedback loop controls but</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.720" end="00:50:22.869" style="s2">using that you know the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.820" end="00:50:24.520" style="s2">mechanism to to shape it anyway yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.869" end="00:50:27.550" style="s2">yeah cuz there&#39;s a bunch of things that</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.520" end="00:50:30.070" style="s2">I&#39;m so wisdom is something I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.550" end="00:50:34.030" style="s2">focused on like I think wisdom is a</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.070" end="00:50:37.510" style="s2">great way to more accurately focus a</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.030" end="00:50:40.330" style="s2">group of people so if somebody is like</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.510" end="00:50:41.650" style="s2">ah you know I&#39;m winning all of these</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.330" end="00:50:44.500" style="s2">things I should be getting a bigger</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.650" end="00:50:46.900" style="s2">share of the pie than anyone else that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.500" end="00:50:48.660" style="s2">potentially persuasive if you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.900" end="00:50:52.150" style="s2">the foresight to see where that leads</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.660" end="00:50:53.859" style="s2">and communication is another really</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.150" end="00:50:56.230" style="s2">important one how can we effectively</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.859" end="00:50:59.200" style="s2">communicate with one another our points</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.230" end="00:51:03.369" style="s2">of view and really come to a decision</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.200" end="00:51:06.550" style="s2">about you know how we structure</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.369" end="00:51:09.190" style="s2">ourselves and just metabolizing some of</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.550" end="00:51:11.369" style="s2">those potentially dangerous aspects</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.190" end="00:51:11.369" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.239" end="00:51:20.609" style="s2">it&#39;s nowadays like yeah it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.759" end="00:51:23.039" style="s2">yeah it seems like because of mode</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.609" end="00:51:25.739" style="s2">because most of history we&#39;ve sort of</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.039" end="00:51:29.789" style="s2">always been in this crunch time we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.739" end="00:51:32.369" style="s2">been always like we haven&#39;t really had</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.789" end="00:51:34.439" style="s2">the time to deliberate these things so I</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.369" end="00:51:37.380" style="s2">think now while times are so good I</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.439" end="00:51:42.089" style="s2">think we need to try and focus and hone</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.380" end="00:51:46.079" style="s2">that their interpersonal communication</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.089" end="00:51:50.400" style="s2">the wisdom the the the metabolizing of</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.079" end="00:51:53.130" style="s2">social dynamics because I just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.400" end="00:51:55.619" style="s2">think we&#39;ve done very well up there at</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.130" end="00:51:59.209" style="s2">the moment phrase metabolizing social</p>

<p begin="00:54:49.400" end="00:54:54.350" style="s2">a thing that the group could potentially</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.740" end="00:54:56.540" style="s2">do and then yeah I guess I guess the</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.350" end="00:54:59.030" style="s2">trick is like finding a way to do that</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.540" end="00:55:01.400" style="s2">that&#39;s fits with the ethical kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.030" end="00:55:04.220" style="s2">framework that we work in because I</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.400" end="00:55:06.230" style="s2">would like to become like I think the</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.220" end="00:55:09.440" style="s2">goal of becoming a self-contained unit</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.230" end="00:55:13.040" style="s2">that self-sustained through so you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.440" end="00:55:14.720" style="s2">some kind of cuz cuz yeah one of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.040" end="00:55:16.580" style="s2">questions that goes round is like well</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.720" end="00:55:18.920" style="s2">how do we how do we support ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.580" end="00:55:20.690" style="s2">going into the transition of game came</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.920" end="00:55:22.820" style="s2">bit how do we move away from game a and</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.690" end="00:55:24.770" style="s2">I think one way to do that is just to</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.820" end="00:55:28.340" style="s2">form groups of people who have the same</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.770" end="00:55:32.360" style="s2">ethics and try to make money in a way</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.340" end="00:55:33.470" style="s2">that is the most aligned with you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.360" end="00:55:35.250" style="s2">because because the thing is we all have</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.470" end="00:55:36.720" style="s2">to go to make money anyway so</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.250" end="00:55:38.700" style="s2">for the meantime we might as well work</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.720" end="00:55:43.590" style="s2">together build that into relational</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.700" end="00:55:45.240" style="s2">skills and you know try and construct</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.590" end="00:55:47.760" style="s2">something together and in creating a</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.240" end="00:55:51.990" style="s2">work environment where we can you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.760" end="00:55:54.780" style="s2">support each other and and you know I</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.990" end="00:55:57.150" style="s2">mean getting money involved always</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.780" end="00:56:00.900" style="s2">introduces new problems but can we solve</p>

<p begin="00:56:12.660" end="00:56:16.920" style="s2">this this thing there&#39;s always there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.760" end="00:56:18.660" style="s2">like maker spaces and there&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.920" end="00:56:21.990" style="s2">in places that sort of focus on you know</p>

<p begin="00:56:23.790" end="00:56:28.890" style="s2">always seem to be done as these separate</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.920" end="00:56:32.550" style="s2">pieces that it would be very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.890" end="00:56:34.860" style="s2">because it has like network we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.550" end="00:56:38.940" style="s2">going on you know within a community for</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.860" end="00:56:41.610" style="s2">anything that&#39;s to do you know Jane B</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.940" end="00:56:43.920" style="s2">ish you know like even if it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.610" end="00:56:45.930" style="s2">couple of steps away just sort of have</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.920" end="00:56:48.270" style="s2">you know coming together and actually</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.930" end="00:56:50.550" style="s2">working together there have been loads</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.270" end="00:56:50.880" style="s2">of attempts to do this Kylie over the</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.550" end="00:56:52.650" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.880" end="00:56:55.200" style="s2">loads of attempts to create like</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.650" end="00:56:56.550" style="s2">umbrella organizations under which all</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.200" end="00:56:57.450" style="s2">of these activist groups can get</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.550" end="00:57:00.120" style="s2">together because they&#39;re all on the same</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.450" end="00:57:02.160" style="s2">team you know there&#39;s been lots and lots</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.120" end="00:57:04.530" style="s2">of incarnations of attempts to do this</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.160" end="00:57:07.050" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s so important it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.530" end="00:57:08.790" style="s2">important it has to happen no one has</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.050" end="00:57:11.610" style="s2">yet succeeded do let me know if you</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.790" end="00:57:13.110" style="s2">figure out to do it well the main thing</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.610" end="00:57:15.690" style="s2">I&#39;m thinking is that you know like you</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.110" end="00:57:17.760" style="s2">need a few people probably a group</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.690" end="00:57:20.160" style="s2">around the size of what rich is talking</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.760" end="00:57:22.380" style="s2">about there say a dozen people who are</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.160" end="00:57:23.910" style="s2">actually members of at least you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.380" end="00:57:26.820" style="s2">say that there&#39;s ten in total that you</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.910" end="00:57:29.940" style="s2">identify that each person is like a</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.820" end="00:57:31.590" style="s2">member of say four of them mmm I mean</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.940" end="00:57:34.080" style="s2">because it starts to stitch poor</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.590" end="00:57:35.340" style="s2">relationships together I don&#39;t think I</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.080" end="00:57:37.020" style="s2">would quite a go for an umbrella</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.340" end="00:57:38.310" style="s2">organization I don&#39;t think that can work</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.020" end="00:57:41.550" style="s2">I think it&#39;s the kind of thing where</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.310" end="00:57:43.320" style="s2">people are always going to focus on the</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.550" end="00:57:47.710" style="s2">things that are of most interest to them</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.320" end="00:57:49.420" style="s2">it&#39;s exactly what happens every time</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.710" end="00:57:51.550" style="s2">I mean I wonder if instead of an</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.420" end="00:57:53.859" style="s2">umbrella organization it just becomes</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.550" end="00:57:56.470" style="s2">sort of like you know game be version of</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.859" end="00:57:57.369" style="s2">Meetup where there&#39;s a network of people</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.470" end="00:57:59.800" style="s2">that have all sort of set them</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.369" end="00:58:01.330" style="s2">interested NIST&#39;s sometimes I might be</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.800" end="00:58:02.740" style="s2">online sometimes it may be in your area</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.330" end="00:58:04.839" style="s2">if you go traveling or you move you may</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.740" end="00:58:06.820" style="s2">still want to you know access that same</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.839" end="00:58:08.440" style="s2">network but then it there&#39;s like that</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.820" end="00:58:11.260" style="s2">framework that Richie&#39;s talking about</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.440" end="00:58:12.760" style="s2">Brett&#39;s not as like free form as meetup</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.260" end="00:58:14.470" style="s2">where it&#39;s here&#39;s the group go do</p>

<p begin="00:58:14.470" end="00:58:19.119" style="s2">you just keep paying us your your meetup</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.290" end="00:58:21.760" style="s2">comm group fee and other than that we</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.119" end="00:58:23.619" style="s2">don&#39;t care it&#39;s like it&#39;s the framework</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.760" end="00:58:25.060" style="s2">for whether it&#39;s an online group or an</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.619" end="00:58:26.109" style="s2">in-person and whether that in-person is</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.060" end="00:58:28.720" style="s2">a business you&#39;re trying to clean up</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.109" end="00:58:30.339" style="s2">creaks what&#39;s common between trying to</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.720" end="00:58:31.810" style="s2">keep that group together how do you</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.339" end="00:58:34.450" style="s2">account for different people for</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.810" end="00:58:36.670" style="s2">different values and then trying to</p>

<p begin="00:58:38.500" end="00:58:42.640" style="s2">that we said that&#39;s worked for all these</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.970" end="00:58:43.780" style="s2">other groups part of it isn&#39;t just each</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.640" end="00:58:47.890" style="s2">group it&#39;s to keep building that</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.780" end="00:58:50.680" style="s2">framework and without the geographic</p>

<p begin="00:58:55.750" end="00:59:01.359" style="s2">do you not I mean that kind of thing it</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.339" end="00:59:03.190" style="s2">makes it extremely difficult I mean to</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.359" end="00:59:04.540" style="s2">actually do anything in the real world</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.190" end="00:59:06.940" style="s2">you know what I mean it just ends up</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.540" end="00:59:08.680" style="s2">becoming discussion groups and then when</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.940" end="00:59:10.450" style="s2">I say just discussion don&#39;t get me wrong</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.680" end="00:59:13.359" style="s2">they&#39;re the most beautiful things in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.450" end="00:59:15.880" style="s2">world but you know that but but but in</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.359" end="00:59:19.210" style="s2">terms of you know taking action in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.880" end="00:59:21.010" style="s2">world there and so maybe maybe just</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.210" end="00:59:22.900" style="s2">accept that that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.010" end="00:59:24.790" style="s2">you&#39;re forming discussion groups making</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.900" end="00:59:26.560" style="s2">friends forming relationships and who</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.790" end="00:59:27.910" style="s2">knows what&#39;s going to come of those down</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.560" end="00:59:30.070" style="s2">the road kind of thing but without the</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.910" end="00:59:34.750" style="s2">geographical proximity I do I do think</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.070" end="00:59:37.510" style="s2">the the the bit of you know the the part</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.750" end="00:59:38.859" style="s2">of your loop of agreeing on a thing that</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.510" end="00:59:41.080" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna do in the world going out</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.859" end="00:59:42.490" style="s2">and doing that right and that being part</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.080" end="00:59:44.589" style="s2">of the process I see that being</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.490" end="00:59:47.170" style="s2">extremely difficult in an online</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.589" end="00:59:49.330" style="s2">community unless unless you unless</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.170" end="00:59:50.980" style="s2">something occurred to me before that you</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.330" end="00:59:52.750" style="s2">goes right back to I was saying at the</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.980" end="00:59:55.540" style="s2">very very start of the conversation to</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.750" end="00:59:57.160" style="s2">but maybe you could make a commitment</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.540" end="00:59:58.630" style="s2">within the group each week or each month</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.160" end="01:00:00.760" style="s2">or whatever month might be better that</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.630" end="01:00:01.480" style="s2">during the course of the next month</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.760" end="01:00:06.640" style="s2">I am going</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.480" end="01:00:08.980" style="s2">to involve five people in my</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.640" end="01:00:10.390" style="s2">neighborhood in something I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.980" end="01:00:12.340" style="s2">what it is yet I don&#39;t know where easier</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.390" end="01:00:14.740" style="s2">but that&#39;s my undertaking is to vote</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.340" end="01:00:17.109" style="s2">involve five people in my immediate</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.740" end="01:00:19.560" style="s2">proximity right in a thing that we can</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.109" end="01:00:22.630" style="s2">all do together whatever it might be</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.560" end="01:00:24.160" style="s2">when you get back to tell you stories</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.630" end="01:00:25.869" style="s2">about what you did what you tried what</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.160" end="01:00:27.550" style="s2">went well what went badly have a laugh</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.869" end="01:00:30.040" style="s2">about it you know to me and then you</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.550" end="01:00:32.020" style="s2">build the community around the stories</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.040" end="01:00:34.210" style="s2">of the things that you&#39;re doing and and</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.020" end="01:00:36.220" style="s2">that kind that that sounds to me like it</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.210" end="01:00:40.119" style="s2">could be really nice mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.220" end="01:00:42.070" style="s2">totally and I think this is on all local</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.119" end="01:00:44.380" style="s2">meetups right we&#39;re like if you come on</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.070" end="01:00:46.150" style="s2">I mean it is it&#39;s an online group but</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.380" end="01:00:48.190" style="s2">the whole point is to meet up locally so</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.150" end="01:00:50.380" style="s2">you&#39;re organized into like here&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.190" end="01:00:51.790" style="s2">city and then you see the different</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.380" end="01:00:54.010" style="s2">meetup groups and you can join them and</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.790" end="01:00:56.470" style="s2">go out and attend you have the similar</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.010" end="01:00:58.450" style="s2">thing but instead of just being a random</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.470" end="01:01:01.390" style="s2">group of people because Viacom is very</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.450" end="01:01:04.600" style="s2">random it is that like the specific</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.390" end="01:01:06.490" style="s2">purpose that like the the the culture</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.600" end="01:01:08.800" style="s2">creator type group or the whole point</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.490" end="01:01:10.530" style="s2">it&#39;s not the groups are a big part of it</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.800" end="01:01:12.850" style="s2">because that&#39;s how it sort of</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.530" end="01:01:15.010" style="s2">materializes in the world and I think</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.850" end="01:01:16.690" style="s2">that&#39;s also where you get a lot of your</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.010" end="01:01:18.340" style="s2">members from it&#39;s sort of two different</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.690" end="01:01:21.190" style="s2">parallel lines you have your group you</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.340" end="01:01:22.300" style="s2">know your groups as they throw up in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.190" end="01:01:23.920" style="s2">world where they&#39;re going out and doing</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.300" end="01:01:25.540" style="s2">things you&#39;ll have people saying you</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.920" end="01:01:26.260" style="s2">know they walk by and see ten people</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.540" end="01:01:28.240" style="s2">painting a fence</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.260" end="01:01:30.250" style="s2">oh what a guy&#39;s doing oh we&#39;re going and</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.240" end="01:01:32.440" style="s2">painting fences in the neighborhood or</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.250" end="01:01:33.820" style="s2">cleaning up a creek or whatever you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.440" end="01:01:36.310" style="s2">have people who just want to join that</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.820" end="01:01:38.560" style="s2">and if you have five people show up and</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.310" end="01:01:40.600" style="s2">there&#39;s this this layer of here&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.560" end="01:01:42.850" style="s2">we&#39;re operating and why and oh we had a</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.600" end="01:01:44.740" style="s2">meeting and and decided to try this new</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.850" end="01:01:46.420" style="s2">way to operate so we&#39;re gonna try it out</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.740" end="01:01:47.950" style="s2">you hear that and the people who are</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.420" end="01:01:50.109" style="s2">interested might be like wait wait what</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.950" end="01:01:51.820" style="s2">I guess talking about and that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.109" end="01:01:54.070" style="s2">you get the people joining the higher</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.820" end="01:01:55.570" style="s2">the higher level group if you just want</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.070" end="01:01:58.390" style="s2">to paint fences just your up and paint</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.570" end="01:02:00.070" style="s2">fences and you&#39;ve got groups within</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.390" end="01:02:01.900" style="s2">groups then as well right because on one</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.070" end="01:02:03.070" style="s2">end you&#39;re doing a local meetup group to</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.900" end="01:02:05.290" style="s2">do the thing that you&#39;ve been talking</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.070" end="01:02:07.390" style="s2">about in your online group right so yeah</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.290" end="01:02:08.800" style="s2">and then so yeah you can&#39;t with an idea</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.390" end="01:02:10.390" style="s2">now something you&#39;re gonna do locally</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.800" end="01:02:12.970" style="s2">you organize a local meetup group about</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.390" end="01:02:14.260" style="s2">that you do that thing and then once a</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.970" end="01:02:15.250" style="s2">week or once a fortnight whatever you</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.260" end="01:02:16.660" style="s2">get together with your own</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.250" end="01:02:18.190" style="s2">and talk about the thing that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.660" end="01:02:20.050" style="s2">doing there and maybe you can</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.190" end="01:02:22.510" style="s2">personalize a little bit between porn</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.050" end="01:02:23.980" style="s2">wenona me it&#39;s a beautiful thing this</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.510" end="01:02:24.400" style="s2">has got real potential it&#39;s a beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.980" end="01:02:27.010" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.400" end="01:02:30.610" style="s2">Thanks so I think one of the biggest</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.010" end="01:02:32.730" style="s2">things is its ability to like if you</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.610" end="01:02:35.320" style="s2">don&#39;t care about that upper level</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.730" end="01:02:37.260" style="s2">completely ignore it just show up and be</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.320" end="01:02:39.490" style="s2">with people in your community you might</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.260" end="01:02:40.990" style="s2">like not actually know what exists and</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.490" end="01:02:43.480" style="s2">that&#39;s fine there&#39;s going up and doing</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.990" end="01:02:44.710" style="s2">it and working in the community and in</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.480" end="01:02:46.690" style="s2">my mind that that also makes the</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.710" end="01:02:49.750" style="s2">framework stronger if not everyone</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.690" end="01:02:52.300" style="s2">involved in the group has full buy on</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.750" end="01:02:54.790" style="s2">every tenet but they are still like the</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.300" end="01:02:55.990" style="s2">group can still handle that person and</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.790" end="01:02:57.670" style="s2">you can hand all the different people</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.990" end="01:02:59.590" style="s2">coming up you have your different rules</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.670" end="01:03:02.350" style="s2">how to handle the different situations</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.590" end="01:03:04.510" style="s2">it becomes a way more flexible robust</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.350" end="01:03:06.460" style="s2">thing that can then you know set the</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.510" end="01:03:08.590" style="s2">framework for more and more but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.460" end="01:03:10.360" style="s2">able to handle people that don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.590" end="01:03:11.860" style="s2">and you know we&#39;ll try to break the</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.360" end="01:03:14.980" style="s2">rules and might not know what&#39;s yeah but</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.860" end="01:03:16.390" style="s2">like that constant reinforcement what do</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.980" end="01:03:18.100" style="s2">you think of all this rich this is your</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.390" end="01:03:19.480" style="s2">thing I mean Rajon I&#39;ve got a bit</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.100" end="01:03:22.680" style="s2">carried away here this is your thing</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.480" end="01:03:27.780" style="s2">though what do you think of all this</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.680" end="01:03:30.970" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s good yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.780" end="01:03:33.850" style="s2">just find letting people find how they</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.970" end="01:03:35.230" style="s2">want to participate although I do like</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.850" end="01:03:38.020" style="s2">one of the things that I would like to</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.230" end="01:03:40.120" style="s2">see is that we we come to some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.020" end="01:03:42.040" style="s2">agreement as a species on some basic</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.120" end="01:03:45.660" style="s2">things because I think well I think we</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.040" end="01:03:47.950" style="s2">really need to build a solid ground</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.660" end="01:03:49.900" style="s2">philosophically that we all share</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.950" end="01:03:52.090" style="s2">to some extent because I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.900" end="01:04:13.630" style="s2">necessary in order to like solve</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.090" end="01:04:15.490" style="s2">agreement we you can you can still bring</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.630" end="01:04:18.670" style="s2">your religion and whatever your religion</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.490" end="01:04:20.740" style="s2">is but this is just like and just a</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.670" end="01:04:22.270" style="s2">shared space that we all agree with it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.740" end="01:04:25.210" style="s2">like okay these are the things that we</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.270" end="01:04:28.490" style="s2">boldly aiming to be lovely a very and</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.210" end="01:04:31.400" style="s2">then you have your own what</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.490" end="01:04:34.040" style="s2">I think it&#39;s very tricky for any any</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.400" end="01:04:36.170" style="s2">anything that everyone can agree on is a</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.040" end="01:04:38.030" style="s2">very very very tricky thing I think the</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.170" end="01:04:40.580" style="s2">best you can hope for is that within the</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.030" end="01:04:43.040" style="s2">groups that form broad agreement on</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.580" end="01:04:44.150" style="s2">those axioms kind of thing but then</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.040" end="01:04:46.280" style="s2">there are other groups that have</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.150" end="01:04:47.900" style="s2">completely different axioms but there is</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.280" end="01:04:50.180" style="s2">sufficient cross-pollination you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.900" end="01:04:51.710" style="s2">between these groups that some</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.180" end="01:04:53.450" style="s2">communication even though it may not be</p>

<p begin="01:07:30.130" end="01:07:34.600" style="s2">important we wait things to be right</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.260" end="01:07:36.670" style="s2">that&#39;s the need we really need things to</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.600" end="01:07:43.359" style="s2">be fair we can argue about how we do</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.670" end="01:07:45.160" style="s2">that all working towards those few core</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.359" end="01:07:47.560" style="s2">tenets of like if it&#39;s not towards this</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.160" end="01:07:49.330" style="s2">we can have a conversation on okay maybe</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.560" end="01:07:52.930" style="s2">when isn&#39;t Paris important it sounds</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.330" end="01:07:54.369" style="s2">like it always is maybe a couple but Bob</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.930" end="01:07:55.840" style="s2">a lot that we all agree on okay</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.369" end="01:07:57.940" style="s2">and these situations you know maybe</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.840" end="01:07:59.470" style="s2">security is more important but the</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.940" end="01:08:01.180" style="s2">overall framework of just that really</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.470" end="01:08:02.320" style="s2">loose statement of like fairness is</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.180" end="01:08:05.260" style="s2">important we all agree on that</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.320" end="01:08:06.910" style="s2">great we maybe make it like a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.260" end="01:08:09.240" style="s2">more precise if you have still agree no</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.910" end="01:08:11.920" style="s2">okay then we&#39;ll just keep it there</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.240" end="01:08:13.330" style="s2">that&#39;s a--that&#39;s a real problem as soon</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.920" end="01:08:15.130" style="s2">as you start to get precise about what</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.330" end="01:08:17.830" style="s2">do you mean by fair then you&#39;re into</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.130" end="01:08:20.560" style="s2">robots and arguments and Wars and but</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.830" end="01:08:23.560" style="s2">the thing we can all agree on is we want</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.560" end="01:08:26.770" style="s2">things to be fair right but so in the</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.560" end="01:08:29.500" style="s2">Brett Weinstein talk that some of most</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.770" end="01:08:31.810" style="s2">of us listen to he talks about hating</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.500" end="01:08:33.700" style="s2">utopians not like he knew topi ins and</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.810" end="01:08:37.450" style="s2">his main argument which I am a hundred</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.700" end="01:08:41.290" style="s2">percent for is that when you maximize</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.450" end="01:08:43.960" style="s2">for one trait it costs everything else</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.290" end="01:08:46.080" style="s2">because of diminishing returns and so we</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.960" end="01:08:49.060" style="s2">can all agree that we love that fairness</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.080" end="01:08:50.620" style="s2">connection needs met all of those things</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.060" end="01:08:54.310" style="s2">because there are different orders for</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.620" end="01:08:55.330" style="s2">us we don&#39;t agree on how much you need</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.310" end="01:08:56.680" style="s2">to do right</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.330" end="01:08:58.030" style="s2">because there&#39;s always the diminishing</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.680" end="01:09:01.000" style="s2">return if we can actually figure out the</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.030" end="01:09:03.250" style="s2">diminishing return then that&#39;s the point</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.000" end="01:09:05.980" style="s2">like it&#39;s like right so fairness even if</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.250" end="01:09:08.320" style="s2">my highest order is fairness I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.980" end="01:09:09.880" style="s2">have every every resource going to</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.320" end="01:09:13.089" style="s2">fairness because it costs everything</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.880" end="01:09:14.950" style="s2">else a society and so finding the point</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.089" end="01:09:16.930" style="s2">of diminishing returns and we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.950" end="01:09:19.120" style="s2">bad at that in society like parenting I</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.930" end="01:09:20.680" style="s2">just wrote this tweet of like parents</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.120" end="01:09:23.320" style="s2">you run like I think I figured out the</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.680" end="01:09:24.670" style="s2">diminishing returns fun parenting I look</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.320" end="01:09:26.890" style="s2">like a crap parent because I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.670" end="01:09:29.140" style="s2">willing to put in every last second of</p>

<p begin="01:09:32.109" end="01:09:35.770" style="s2">definitely hurt me more than it would</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.460" end="01:09:37.870" style="s2">help me and it&#39;s like finding but but</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.770" end="01:09:41.109" style="s2">like as a parent I&#39;m supposed to write</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.870" end="01:09:42.820" style="s2">like every last ounce of every energy</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.109" end="01:09:51.400" style="s2">every dollar should be going to her and</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.820" end="01:09:54.010" style="s2">it&#39;s like no it&#39;s sort of like a</p>

<p begin="01:09:54.010" end="01:09:58.150" style="s2">ahead I think we may have been sort of</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.620" end="01:09:59.920" style="s2">saying the same thing in different ways</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.150" end="01:10:01.870" style="s2">take the pret Oh principal right where</p>

<p begin="01:10:08.290" end="01:10:11.400" style="s2">important thing not if we&#39;re saying that</p>

<p begin="01:10:11.400" end="01:10:15.940" style="s2">diminishing return you find that initial</p>

<p begin="01:11:40.190" end="01:11:44.570" style="s2">principle right like where do I give and</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.860" end="01:11:47.270" style="s2">feel good about it maybe I&#39;m never gonna</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.570" end="01:11:50.179" style="s2">be the 20% anywhere but I&#39;m you know the</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.270" end="01:11:52.640" style="s2">next the 5% next to it so many places</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.179" end="01:11:54.890" style="s2">right it&#39;s like cool or not if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.640" end="01:11:58.429" style="s2">the lowest and everywhere but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.890" end="01:12:00.320" style="s2">there with a lot of this our ability to</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.429" end="01:12:02.570" style="s2">measure it is gonna be suspect at best</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.320" end="01:12:04.520" style="s2">so we&#39;re not gonna hit that exactly 20%</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.570" end="01:12:07.010" style="s2">I think if we&#39;re using the proto</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.520" end="01:12:08.630" style="s2">principle as an example it&#39;s say okay if</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.010" end="01:12:11.270" style="s2">we were to be as efficient as possible</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.630" end="01:12:13.219" style="s2">let&#39;s say we take the top 25% of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.270" end="01:12:15.350" style="s2">yield and harvest it that means the last</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.219" end="01:12:16.699" style="s2">25% we&#39;re gonna see them on the ground</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.350" end="01:12:18.710" style="s2">saying why aren&#39;t we picking that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.699" end="01:12:20.210" style="s2">right there you like to cut there&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.710" end="01:12:22.489" style="s2">one P in each of them and it&#39;s just not</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.210" end="01:12:24.440" style="s2">worth it and it&#39;s sort of being able to</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.489" end="01:12:26.179" style="s2">identify it and saying okay if fairness</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.440" end="01:12:27.710" style="s2">is super-important here&#39;s our biggest</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.179" end="01:12:30.199" style="s2">returns here&#39;s the things that we can do</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.710" end="01:12:31.790" style="s2">easily to get the best return here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.199" end="01:12:33.320" style="s2">sort of where the cut off happens here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.790" end="01:12:35.630" style="s2">all of these things that as far as we</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.320" end="01:12:38.600" style="s2">know aren&#39;t worth it right like it takes</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.630" end="01:12:40.550" style="s2">so much to implement and we&#39;ll only get</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.600" end="01:12:41.840" style="s2">that much back if we learn new</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.550" end="01:12:44.030" style="s2">information where maybe that change is</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.840" end="01:12:46.010" style="s2">great we can reassess it but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.030" end="01:12:48.500" style="s2">figuring out and sort of identifying</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.010" end="01:12:50.600" style="s2">where the diminishing returns are yeah</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.500" end="01:12:51.980" style="s2">sort of agreeing on yet in an ideal</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.600" end="01:12:53.750" style="s2">world we could do everything that</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.980" end="01:12:55.850" style="s2">implemented fairness but we&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.750" end="01:12:56.840" style="s2">these you know kenner or 20 things we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.850" end="01:12:58.310" style="s2">not sure how that would work</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.840" end="01:13:02.300" style="s2">so right now we&#39;re all agreeing to not</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.310" end="01:13:04.520" style="s2">do that thing and that&#39;s the you know if</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.300" end="01:13:07.460" style="s2">75% of the peas that are left on artists</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.520" end="01:13:08.960" style="s2">ed which looks really bad if you&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.460" end="01:13:11.719" style="s2">gardener you&#39;re like why didn&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.960" end="01:13:14.050" style="s2">there&#39;s still so much left to do yeah</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.719" end="01:13:16.340" style="s2">that&#39;s intentional I&#39;m doing other stuff</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.050" end="01:13:20.909" style="s2">doing that that&#39;s that&#39;s when he</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.340" end="01:13:22.800" style="s2">represent in every field I think</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.909" end="01:13:23.999" style="s2">I&#39;d love to see is a bunch of all that</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.800" end="01:13:26.309" style="s2">all the different things that are sort</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.999" end="01:13:27.749" style="s2">of like fairness you know it&#39;s like we</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.309" end="01:13:29.550" style="s2">all agree on fairness and more agreed</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.749" end="01:13:32.729" style="s2">that just important then you know what</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.550" end="01:13:36.510" style="s2">we kind of had a list or say ten things</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.729" end="01:13:38.249" style="s2">I like a list that Ritchie started in</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.510" end="01:13:40.530" style="s2">the document that listed like you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.249" end="01:13:42.269" style="s2">the the no driver is a non-violent and</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.530" end="01:13:43.889" style="s2">and those things starting that kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.269" end="01:13:45.329" style="s2">list where you might be able to start to</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.889" end="01:13:47.610" style="s2">dissect them and group them and stuff</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.329" end="01:13:49.979" style="s2">but yeah actually being able to list</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.610" end="01:13:54.570" style="s2">them out and saying here&#39;s it do we all</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.979" end="01:13:58.159" style="s2">agree who disagrees and why you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.570" end="01:13:58.159" style="s2">what&#39;s the order but they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.530" end="01:14:05.189" style="s2">understand that like even if fairness is</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.939" end="01:14:07.289" style="s2">your top priority right we&#39;re never</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.189" end="01:14:13.949" style="s2">gonna get to the hundred of those</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.289" end="01:14:16.650" style="s2">fairness 100 percent agreement that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.949" end="01:14:18.329" style="s2">really really really good point and no</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.650" end="01:14:20.039" style="s2">absolutely works on agreement as well</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.329" end="01:14:22.169" style="s2">right what if you can get eighty percent</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.039" end="01:14:24.059" style="s2">of people behind it&#39;s a no idea pretty</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.169" end="01:14:25.829" style="s2">easily because it&#39;s obviously good then</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.059" end="01:14:27.900" style="s2">you don&#39;t need to fight tooth and now</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.829" end="01:14:29.189" style="s2">for the other 20 percent</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.900" end="01:14:31.590" style="s2">there&#39;s better ways to invest your time</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.189" end="01:14:33.269" style="s2">those people who are in their net last</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.590" end="01:14:34.739" style="s2">twenty percent hopefully they&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.269" end="01:14:39.419" style="s2">eighty percent in a bunch of other areas</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.739" end="01:14:40.949" style="s2">where they exactly that&#39;s the important</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.419" end="01:14:42.780" style="s2">things to remember that was really that</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.949" end="01:14:44.579" style="s2">was brilliant Jubilee that was for me</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.780" end="01:14:46.380" style="s2">anyway that was super insightful that</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.579" end="01:14:48.300" style="s2">was brilliant I think we just solved</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.380" end="01:14:55.019" style="s2">game B let&#39;s say I think we can do more</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.300" end="01:14:56.610" style="s2">here we just did it to Kayla I was</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.019" end="01:14:58.139" style="s2">actually just one I was actually just</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.610" end="01:15:00.539" style="s2">thinking that you know that so once</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.139" end="01:15:02.880" style="s2">you&#39;ve got all of those maybe instead of</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.539" end="01:15:06.780" style="s2">us trying to argue about which is most</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.880" end="01:15:12.269" style="s2">important to instead be able to focus on</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.780" end="01:15:14.300" style="s2">which ones we we feel are not being met</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.269" end="01:15:17.099" style="s2">for us at the moment</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.300" end="01:15:20.939" style="s2">so you know it&#39;s well you basically only</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.099" end="01:15:22.829" style="s2">looking to repair something rather than</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.939" end="01:15:26.030" style="s2">come up with some kind of abstract</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.829" end="01:15:28.169" style="s2">statement about yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.030" end="01:15:30.749" style="s2">locking yourself into some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.169" end="01:15:32.519" style="s2">definition and then if you you know if</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.749" end="01:15:34.019" style="s2">you if you&#39;re doing this with a group of</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.519" end="01:15:34.590" style="s2">say twenty people who are all going</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.019" end="01:15:36.389" style="s2">around</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.590" end="01:15:39.590" style="s2">saying I feel like it&#39;s not fair it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.389" end="01:15:42.750" style="s2">not fair it&#39;s not fair it&#39;s not fair</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.590" end="01:15:44.909" style="s2">then kind of go okay so in it&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.750" end="01:15:48.270" style="s2">trying to find a way to make this more</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.909" end="01:15:51.599" style="s2">fair right so no perfectly fair but you</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.270" end="01:15:54.480" style="s2">know like less unfair more fair and just</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.599" end="01:15:56.300" style="s2">kind of have this sort of picture of</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.480" end="01:15:58.830" style="s2">like when things are out of balance</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.300" end="01:16:00.389" style="s2">right and that is the thing that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.830" end="01:16:03.449" style="s2">sort of aiming towards rather than</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.389" end="01:16:06.960" style="s2">trying to you know prioritize all the</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.449" end="01:16:10.650" style="s2">time based on some sort of tax ideal</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.960" end="01:16:12.000" style="s2">anyway all right well we&#39;re like 15</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.650" end="01:16:13.500" style="s2">minutes almost gone</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.000" end="01:16:15.630" style="s2">who sixty minutes over at the moment</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.500" end="01:16:16.860" style="s2">this is we usually just stop and then we</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.630" end="01:16:18.420" style="s2">just have this conversation without</p>
