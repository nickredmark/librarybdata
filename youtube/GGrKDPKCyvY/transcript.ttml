<p begin="00:07:47.759" end="00:07:51.199" style="s2">there is an update with respect to unity</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.440" end="00:07:53.199" style="s2">which those of you who have been</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.199" end="00:07:55.120" style="s2">attending our campfires will know about</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.199" end="00:07:58.160" style="s2">but the rest of you should know</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.120" end="00:08:01.199" style="s2">so the unity 2020 plan involved</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.160" end="00:08:02.560" style="s2">a proposal to draft candidates to elect</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.199" end="00:08:06.479" style="s2">to the white house</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.560" end="00:08:08.000" style="s2">it came with a pair of failsafes to</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.479" end="00:08:10.800" style="s2">prevent it from spoiling</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.000" end="00:08:13.280" style="s2">the election one of those failsafes was</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.800" end="00:08:15.919" style="s2">if as the election approached we did not</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.280" end="00:08:17.759" style="s2">have a viable path to victory we would</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.919" end="00:08:19.440" style="s2">pull the plug on the plan so that it</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.759" end="00:08:21.919" style="s2">couldn&#39;t spoil the election</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.440" end="00:08:23.199" style="s2">and we have arrived the decision that</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.919" end="00:08:26.639" style="s2">this is that moment</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.199" end="00:08:29.120" style="s2">now were there to be some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.639" end="00:08:30.720" style="s2">an emergency that would cause the</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.120" end="00:08:32.240" style="s2">electorate to wake up to the danger that</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.720" end="00:08:33.839" style="s2">we are in all of a sudden and to go</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.240" end="00:08:36.240" style="s2">groping for a better plan</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.839" end="00:08:37.120" style="s2">than the major parties have delivered us</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.240" end="00:08:39.599" style="s2">the plan</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.120" end="00:08:40.959" style="s2">could be rebooted but that is not our</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.599" end="00:08:42.159" style="s2">expectation</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.959" end="00:08:44.560" style="s2">so let me tell you a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.159" end="00:08:46.800" style="s2">what this does and doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.560" end="00:08:48.720" style="s2">it means that we are not going to</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.800" end="00:08:50.880" style="s2">attempt to draft our ticket</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.720" end="00:08:52.000" style="s2">but what we have recognized in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.880" end="00:08:55.680" style="s2">process of</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.000" end="00:08:58.000" style="s2">working on unity 2020 is that the</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.680" end="00:08:59.360" style="s2">plan is part of a larger movement and</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.000" end="00:09:01.760" style="s2">the movement is one</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.360" end="00:09:02.480" style="s2">that stands against the things that have</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.760" end="00:09:05.440" style="s2">corrupted</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.480" end="00:09:06.000" style="s2">our governmental structure and the need</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.440" end="00:09:09.279" style="s2">for it</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.000" end="00:09:10.640" style="s2">is as great or greater than it was when</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.279" end="00:09:12.640" style="s2">we started it so</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.640" end="00:09:13.760" style="s2">the movement is going to continue we are</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.640" end="00:09:16.000" style="s2">going to look</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.760" end="00:09:17.839" style="s2">to the long term and attempt to figure</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.000" end="00:09:20.800" style="s2">out how it is that we can</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.839" end="00:09:21.600" style="s2">rescue our republic from the death</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.800" end="00:09:24.720" style="s2">spiral</p>

<p begin="00:09:24.720" end="00:09:30.399" style="s2">inflicted upon it so that&#39;s where we</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.040" end="00:09:33.519" style="s2">stand with unity 2020</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.399" end="00:09:36.160" style="s2">not uh the best news but not hopeless</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.519" end="00:09:37.519" style="s2">not an end well let me say i&#39;m not even</p>

<p begin="00:10:17.760" end="00:10:20.800" style="s2">phenomena about the importance of a</p>

<p begin="00:10:37.440" end="00:10:41.200" style="s2">or something to that effect but the</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.760" end="00:10:43.440" style="s2">point is</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.200" end="00:10:45.680" style="s2">we discovered a tremendous amount in</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.440" end="00:10:46.000" style="s2">this process about what needs to take</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.680" end="00:10:48.880" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.000" end="00:10:49.680" style="s2">in order to fix the uh the corruption</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.880" end="00:10:52.320" style="s2">that has</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.680" end="00:10:52.880" style="s2">uh disrupted governance and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.320" end="00:10:56.079" style="s2">there is</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.880" end="00:10:58.560" style="s2">a tremendous amount of of goodwill</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.079" end="00:11:00.000" style="s2">and pressure and force in in the right</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.560" end="00:11:02.640" style="s2">in the you know physics sense</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.000" end="00:11:04.079" style="s2">of the term um behind this you know it</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.640" end="00:11:07.200" style="s2">was it was apparent</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.079" end="00:11:08.959" style="s2">that there is as you and i and many</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.200" end="00:11:12.000" style="s2">others have long suspected</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.959" end="00:11:14.720" style="s2">a real visceral</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.000" end="00:11:15.600" style="s2">intellectual and emotional desire to see</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.720" end="00:11:17.360" style="s2">a fix</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.600" end="00:11:19.120" style="s2">uh and that fix might well look like</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.360" end="00:11:21.360" style="s2">this yeah it really</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.120" end="00:11:22.240" style="s2">lacked one thing which was uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.360" end="00:11:24.880" style="s2">exponential</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.240" end="00:11:25.760" style="s2">growth which you know in some sense is</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.880" end="00:11:28.240" style="s2">the thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.760" end="00:11:28.959" style="s2">on the other hand what it did do was</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.240" end="00:11:32.320" style="s2">surface</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.959" end="00:11:33.519" style="s2">the the underlying belief structure of a</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.320" end="00:11:36.480" style="s2">great many patriots</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.519" end="00:11:38.079" style="s2">and so you know does it set the stage</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.480" end="00:11:39.120" style="s2">for us to do something in the future</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.079" end="00:11:41.200" style="s2">that could in fact</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.120" end="00:11:42.959" style="s2">recapture the white house or other</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.200" end="00:11:45.040" style="s2">structures on behalf of the people</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.959" end="00:11:47.120" style="s2">i think it revealed the path there and</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.040" end="00:11:50.240" style="s2">so you know personally</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.120" end="00:11:53.040" style="s2">i um i</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.240" end="00:11:54.000" style="s2">feel imperiled to know that what is very</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.040" end="00:11:57.279" style="s2">likely to happen</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.000" end="00:12:00.480" style="s2">is you know we were going to get one the</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.279" end="00:12:02.720" style="s2">the duopoly&#39;s version a or b right</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.480" end="00:12:05.519" style="s2">that&#39;s a very frightening prospect</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.720" end="00:12:07.040" style="s2">um and i wish we i wish somebody had</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.519" end="00:12:09.360" style="s2">figured out a way out of that mess</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.040" end="00:12:10.399" style="s2">didn&#39;t happen so okay that&#39;s frightening</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.360" end="00:12:12.560" style="s2">on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.399" end="00:12:14.399" style="s2">i&#39;m not the least bit disappointed at</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.560" end="00:12:17.680" style="s2">what happened here i think</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.399" end="00:12:20.800" style="s2">we beat expectations by a lot right</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.680" end="00:12:21.519" style="s2">we ran a successful ranked choice vote</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.800" end="00:12:23.040" style="s2">we had</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.519" end="00:12:25.440" style="s2">high level discussions with lots of</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.040" end="00:12:26.800" style="s2">people both you know on our campfires</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.440" end="00:12:29.360" style="s2">and behind the scenes</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.800" end="00:12:31.440" style="s2">and so we did discover that the niche in</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.360" end="00:12:34.000" style="s2">question exists and the question is</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.440" end="00:12:34.959" style="s2">what do you do with it so we will see</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.000" end="00:12:38.320" style="s2">going forward but</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.959" end="00:12:41.600" style="s2">uh if you have been following unity 2020</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.320" end="00:12:43.519" style="s2">please know that what has changed is the</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.600" end="00:12:46.639" style="s2">unity 2020 plan itself</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.519" end="00:12:48.800" style="s2">the unity movement still exists and is</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.639" end="00:12:50.240" style="s2">as dedicated as ever to the prospect of</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.800" end="00:12:53.440" style="s2">fixing our system</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.240" end="00:12:54.079" style="s2">perhaps something like unity 2020 is</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.440" end="00:12:56.880" style="s2">dead</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.079" end="00:12:57.680" style="s2">long live unity i like that i wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.880" end="00:13:00.639" style="s2">say dead it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.680" end="00:13:02.880" style="s2">uh unity 2020 yeah is dead this was</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.639" end="00:13:04.240" style="s2">about a particular moment in time</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.880" end="00:13:06.399" style="s2">right this is about a particular</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.240" end="00:13:07.200" style="s2">presidential election appending the 2020</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.399" end="00:13:09.680" style="s2">to it</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.200" end="00:13:10.959" style="s2">so just like the king is dead long live</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.680" end="00:13:12.800" style="s2">the king refers to two different</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.959" end="00:13:14.800" style="s2">instantiations of the king</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.800" end="00:13:16.320" style="s2">unity 2020 is presumably not the name of</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.800" end="00:13:18.399" style="s2">the movement going forward because</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.320" end="00:13:19.600" style="s2">it pinpoints the origin date and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.399" end="00:13:21.920" style="s2">forward-looking movement</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.600" end="00:13:23.600" style="s2">right yeah though my concern was not</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.920" end="00:13:27.120" style="s2">with the unity 2020 part it&#39;s with</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.600" end="00:13:28.880" style="s2">dead because the prototype mindset i</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.120" end="00:13:30.800" style="s2">you know is it dead but it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.880" end="00:13:32.959" style="s2">matter it&#39;s a semantic question</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.800" end="00:13:34.160" style="s2">there are multiple lenses with which to</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.959" end="00:13:37.839" style="s2">approach something and i</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.160" end="00:13:40.800" style="s2">obviously agree with the prototype lens</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.839" end="00:13:42.480" style="s2">but using a phrase from history doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.800" end="00:13:44.959" style="s2">render the prototype lens</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.480" end="00:13:46.720" style="s2">inoperable right except that you have</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.959" end="00:13:47.519" style="s2">neglected the fact that history is</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.720" end="00:13:50.079" style="s2">itself a</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.519" end="00:13:51.360" style="s2">tool of oppression and therefore we must</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.079" end="00:13:53.680" style="s2">you know that&#39;s cheating</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.360" end="00:13:54.399" style="s2">i&#39;m kidding i know it was only a joke</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.680" end="00:13:56.399" style="s2">all right</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.399" end="00:13:57.920" style="s2">so that&#39;s the unity 2020 update the</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.399" end="00:13:59.120" style="s2">unity movement continues this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.920" end="00:14:00.959" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to model this right like</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.120" end="00:14:01.600" style="s2">when people pull that [ __ ] on you that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.959" end="00:14:04.399" style="s2">cheating</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.600" end="00:14:05.839" style="s2">stop right and the way you really stop</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.399" end="00:14:07.760" style="s2">them is the eyebrows the</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.839" end="00:14:09.600" style="s2">double raised eyebrow thing that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.760" end="00:14:11.440" style="s2">shot across the bow so</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.600" end="00:14:12.959" style="s2">all right maybe a slight eye roll and a</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.440" end="00:14:15.600" style="s2">slack jaw oh god</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.959" end="00:14:16.000" style="s2">oh yeah yeah the eye roll and the up to</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.600" end="00:14:18.399" style="s2">the right</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.000" end="00:14:19.440" style="s2">thing man yeah that is uh that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.399" end="00:14:22.800" style="s2">warning</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.440" end="00:14:25.600" style="s2">okay so next topic was</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.800" end="00:14:26.720" style="s2">uh i wanted to talk about the technical</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.600" end="00:14:28.320" style="s2">difficulties and</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.720" end="00:14:29.920" style="s2">again you all probably don&#39;t care very</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.320" end="00:14:30.959" style="s2">much about the technical yeah we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.920" end="00:14:32.079" style="s2">you&#39;re not interested in talking about</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.959" end="00:14:33.839" style="s2">technical difficulties</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.079" end="00:14:35.360" style="s2">this is in service of understanding how</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.839" end="00:14:37.360" style="s2">to make sense in the world so</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.360" end="00:14:38.880" style="s2">let me before you start we want to talk</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.360" end="00:14:42.160" style="s2">a little bit about this</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.880" end="00:14:45.199" style="s2">sort of how to take a problem that</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.160" end="00:14:48.480" style="s2">we happen to have experienced and apply</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.199" end="00:14:50.480" style="s2">a careful scientific approach to it</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.480" end="00:14:52.160" style="s2">in order to try to make sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.480" end="00:14:55.120" style="s2">world uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.160" end="00:14:56.000" style="s2">segwaying from there into how is it that</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.120" end="00:14:58.800" style="s2">so many of us</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.000" end="00:14:59.920" style="s2">are having a hard time making sense of</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.800" end="00:15:01.839" style="s2">what is being</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.920" end="00:15:03.519" style="s2">provided to us and what it looks like</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.839" end="00:15:04.480" style="s2">the other side is saying about who we</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.519" end="00:15:06.560" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.480" end="00:15:08.320" style="s2">that is to say to what degree are the</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.560" end="00:15:10.480" style="s2">reflections being shown back at us</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.320" end="00:15:11.839" style="s2">actually accurate um and then i want to</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.480" end="00:15:13.199" style="s2">talk a little bit about the downstream</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.839" end="00:15:15.760" style="s2">effects of some of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.199" end="00:15:17.040" style="s2">um you know batshit nonsense coming out</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.760" end="00:15:19.199" style="s2">of um</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.040" end="00:15:21.279" style="s2">gender theory cool i wish it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.199" end="00:15:22.000" style="s2">called bat [ __ ] nonsense but i get it</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.279" end="00:15:24.079" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.000" end="00:15:26.160" style="s2">so i i need a prop for this can you hand</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.079" end="00:15:28.240" style="s2">me the cat yeah oh absolutely always</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.160" end="00:15:29.759" style="s2">all right here we go the cat right now</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.240" end="00:15:32.079" style="s2">the cat let&#39;s be fair facts</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.759" end="00:15:34.320" style="s2">right yeah the cat is a complex system</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.079" end="00:15:35.680" style="s2">yes and this is a complex system with so</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.320" end="00:15:37.360" style="s2">much complexity</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.680" end="00:15:38.959" style="s2">that it&#39;s very difficult to sort out</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.360" end="00:15:40.720" style="s2">what&#39;s going on uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.959" end="00:15:42.399" style="s2">that drives it and causes it to behave</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.720" end="00:15:45.199" style="s2">the way that it does</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.399" end="00:15:45.600" style="s2">something like the uh apparatus we use</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.199" end="00:15:47.839" style="s2">to do</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.600" end="00:15:50.000" style="s2">podcasting is a complex system that is</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.839" end="00:15:52.000" style="s2">so many orders of magnitude less complex</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.000" end="00:15:55.360" style="s2">that it actually lends itself to</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.000" end="00:15:57.040" style="s2">uh scientific solving more simply right</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.360" end="00:15:59.199" style="s2">it does it&#39;s not going to require</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.040" end="00:16:00.800" style="s2">years of study to figure out how it</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.199" end="00:16:02.160" style="s2">works and to troubleshoot it okay you</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.800" end="00:16:03.680" style="s2">know that i&#39;m going to put an asterisk</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.160" end="00:16:06.800" style="s2">here and say you know as</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.680" end="00:16:08.639" style="s2">as an animal behaviorist i will i</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.800" end="00:16:10.880" style="s2">constantly aspire to try to understand</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.639" end="00:16:12.720" style="s2">the complex system that is the cat oh</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.880" end="00:16:14.800" style="s2">you and me both on the other hand we</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.720" end="00:16:16.480" style="s2">both know that we are a million miles</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.800" end="00:16:18.320" style="s2">collectively scientifically from</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.480" end="00:16:19.279" style="s2">understanding how a single cell in that</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.320" end="00:16:22.480" style="s2">animal works</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.279" end="00:16:24.480" style="s2">right and that animal is composed of oh</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.480" end="00:16:26.959" style="s2">at least hundreds of billions of cells</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.480" end="00:16:28.959" style="s2">so in any case there is so much mystery</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.959" end="00:16:30.720" style="s2">left in that complex system that it is</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.959" end="00:16:32.320" style="s2">still orders of magnitude short</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.720" end="00:16:33.920" style="s2">even if we can skip to something like</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.320" end="00:16:35.360" style="s2">the behavior of the animal and say</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.920" end="00:16:36.800" style="s2">actually we know an awful lot about why</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.360" end="00:16:38.639" style="s2">it does what it does and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.800" end="00:16:40.079" style="s2">you know the residual the mystery that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.639" end="00:16:40.800" style="s2">still left which is the part that you</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.079" end="00:16:44.399" style="s2">and i</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.800" end="00:16:46.399" style="s2">find the most fascinating but all right</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.399" end="00:16:48.399" style="s2">back to this mini complex system that is</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.399" end="00:16:51.199" style="s2">our podcast apparatus</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.399" end="00:16:53.680" style="s2">those who are paying attention around um</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.199" end="00:16:56.000" style="s2">live stream number 45 i believe</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.680" end="00:16:56.880" style="s2">will remember that we were inundated by</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.000" end="00:17:00.160" style="s2">smoke</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.880" end="00:17:02.639" style="s2">um and that the uh cameras were</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.160" end="00:17:04.240" style="s2">all dropping out somewhat regularly no</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.639" end="00:17:07.360" style="s2">matter what camera angle</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.240" end="00:17:08.720" style="s2">zach put on us the signal would drop out</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.360" end="00:17:11.600" style="s2">and you would see</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.720" end="00:17:13.280" style="s2">rainbow color bars indicating the</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.600" end="00:17:15.600" style="s2">absence of signal</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.280" end="00:17:16.959" style="s2">and as i said last time we did a ton of</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.600" end="00:17:18.959" style="s2">troubleshooting to figure out what might</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.959" end="00:17:19.760" style="s2">be going on it was all three cameras two</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.959" end="00:17:22.319" style="s2">other cameras</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.760" end="00:17:23.280" style="s2">did it ultimately we discovered that it</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.319" end="00:17:25.360" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.280" end="00:17:27.039" style="s2">many devices in the house that put out</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.360" end="00:17:29.840" style="s2">signal over hdmi</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.039" end="00:17:31.679" style="s2">and nothing that was uninvolved in hdmi</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.840" end="00:17:33.120" style="s2">this led us to the question of was there</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.679" end="00:17:36.480" style="s2">some kind of radiation</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.120" end="00:17:38.320" style="s2">that might be affecting the system</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.480" end="00:17:40.080" style="s2">and somebody one of our viewers</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.320" end="00:17:41.360" style="s2">suggested it could possibly be radon</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.080" end="00:17:43.120" style="s2">which would make sense because we had</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.360" end="00:17:44.559" style="s2">the windows closed due to the smoke here</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.120" end="00:17:46.960" style="s2">in portland</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.559" end="00:17:48.160" style="s2">and radon which is the product of</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.960" end="00:17:51.760" style="s2">radioactive decay</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.160" end="00:17:53.200" style="s2">of uh isotopes in the soil the radon is</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.760" end="00:17:55.280" style="s2">produced by that decay</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.200" end="00:17:56.960" style="s2">larger heavier elements break down radon</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.280" end="00:17:59.039" style="s2">is one of the products it&#39;s a gas it</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.960" end="00:18:01.360" style="s2">floats up from your crawl space</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.039" end="00:18:03.280" style="s2">and if your house is well sealed it can</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.360" end="00:18:04.400" style="s2">be trapped and if the levels rise to a</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.280" end="00:18:06.320" style="s2">high enough degree</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.400" end="00:18:08.160" style="s2">it can interfere you know with your</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.320" end="00:18:10.160" style="s2">cells for one thing it can cause</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.160" end="00:18:11.200" style="s2">mutations and things so somebody</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.160" end="00:18:12.960" style="s2">suggested maybe</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.200" end="00:18:14.559" style="s2">our windows being tightly closed during</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.960" end="00:18:16.480" style="s2">the smoke period had caused radon to</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.559" end="00:18:18.559" style="s2">build up we have a radon problem</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.480" end="00:18:20.480" style="s2">i tested that hypothesis i got a radon</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.559" end="00:18:22.080" style="s2">detector i&#39;ve let it run for a week</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.480" end="00:18:23.679" style="s2">we have low levels of radon so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.080" end="00:18:25.840" style="s2">not it so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.679" end="00:18:26.799" style="s2">again leaves us with this mystery and as</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.840" end="00:18:28.960" style="s2">as often</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.799" end="00:18:30.480" style="s2">uh with careful scientific</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.960" end="00:18:33.440" style="s2">investigations</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.480" end="00:18:35.280" style="s2">you&#39;re left with some relief that you</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.440" end="00:18:36.320" style="s2">haven&#39;t been poisoned within your home</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.280" end="00:18:39.280" style="s2">in this case</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.320" end="00:18:40.559" style="s2">and some disappointment that you have</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.280" end="00:18:43.280" style="s2">not apparently come</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.559" end="00:18:44.160" style="s2">on the hypothesis that is likely to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.280" end="00:18:47.200" style="s2">true</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.160" end="00:18:49.520" style="s2">so right not that falsified radon so</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.200" end="00:18:51.120" style="s2">hypothesis it&#39;s radon build up and that</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.520" end="00:18:52.640" style="s2">would be consistent with the windows</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.120" end="00:18:54.559" style="s2">being closed prediction</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.640" end="00:18:56.880" style="s2">if you test for radon you will find high</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.559" end="00:18:58.400" style="s2">levels of it falsified no we don&#39;t find</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.880" end="00:19:01.039" style="s2">higher levels of radon well but</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.400" end="00:19:02.000" style="s2">so as we did last time one prediction of</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.039" end="00:19:05.440" style="s2">that hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.000" end="00:19:06.640" style="s2">is but it&#39;s not a exclusive prediction</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.440" end="00:19:09.760" style="s2">of this hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.640" end="00:19:11.360" style="s2">is once you open your windows the</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.760" end="00:19:12.720" style="s2">problems will be resolved</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.360" end="00:19:14.640" style="s2">the problems were resolved once we</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.720" end="00:19:17.360" style="s2">opened the windows so that was</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.640" end="00:19:19.440" style="s2">coincident with the hypothesis that it</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.360" end="00:19:21.360" style="s2">was radon being trapped in the house</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.440" end="00:19:22.880" style="s2">but it also is also a prediction of</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.360" end="00:19:24.559" style="s2">other hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.880" end="00:19:26.320" style="s2">other hypotheses so it&#39;s not a strong</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.559" end="00:19:27.440" style="s2">prediction on account of being a</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.320" end="00:19:29.679" style="s2">prediction that follows from</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.440" end="00:19:31.760" style="s2">all possible hypotheses the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.679" end="00:19:32.720" style="s2">the multiple hypotheses are pretty</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.760" end="00:19:34.880" style="s2">exotic</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.720" end="00:19:36.400" style="s2">right so it does seem clear we have some</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.880" end="00:19:38.320" style="s2">kind of interference</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.400" end="00:19:41.120" style="s2">it&#39;s some kind of interference that</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.320" end="00:19:42.799" style="s2">seems to register on hdmi and nothing</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.120" end="00:19:44.880" style="s2">else which is</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.799" end="00:19:46.240" style="s2">interesting a lot of searching reveals</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.880" end="00:19:48.160" style="s2">nothing of that nature</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.240" end="00:19:49.919" style="s2">i don&#39;t find anything that there&#39;s lots</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.160" end="00:19:51.600" style="s2">of talk online about</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.919" end="00:19:53.840" style="s2">various kinds of electromagnetic</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.600" end="00:19:55.039" style="s2">interference but hdmi does not seem</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.840" end="00:19:56.880" style="s2">particularly prone</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.039" end="00:19:59.120" style="s2">also people noticed that there was a</p>

<p begin="00:20:00.400" end="00:20:04.320" style="s2">which led many in our audience who were</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.000" end="00:20:06.480" style="s2">technically savvy to propose that it had</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.320" end="00:20:07.919" style="s2">something to do with a mismatch of frame</p>

<p begin="00:20:08.720" end="00:20:12.240" style="s2">which didn&#39;t make a lot of sense because</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.480" end="00:20:13.600" style="s2">nothing had changed on that front</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.240" end="00:20:14.640" style="s2">and if one camera had gotten out of</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.600" end="00:20:16.080" style="s2">whack it wouldn&#39;t have been on the</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.640" end="00:20:16.640" style="s2">others so it would have had to be in the</p>

<p begin="00:20:16.640" end="00:20:19.440" style="s2">and if we swapped in a different</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.679" end="00:20:20.480" style="s2">computer it didn&#39;t happen so there were</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.440" end="00:20:22.480" style="s2">a lot of reasons to think that</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.480" end="00:20:24.880" style="s2">hypothesis was wrong</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.480" end="00:20:25.679" style="s2">it is i think possible and maybe one of</p>

<p begin="00:20:44.880" end="00:20:48.640" style="s2">disappeared from the system so that</p>

<p begin="00:21:15.440" end="00:21:18.799" style="s2">10 to 12</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.000" end="00:21:20.000" style="s2">days depending on how you count on</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.799" end="00:21:22.960" style="s2">friday of last week</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.000" end="00:21:23.679" style="s2">eight days ago the rains came the air</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.960" end="00:21:26.880" style="s2">cleared</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.679" end="00:21:27.760" style="s2">we opened the windows so really two big</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.880" end="00:21:29.520" style="s2">things it was all</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.760" end="00:21:30.880" style="s2">of a system but two big things changed</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.520" end="00:21:33.360" style="s2">at once not only</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.880" end="00:21:34.960" style="s2">did the air quality in our house become</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.360" end="00:21:36.400" style="s2">much better because we were able to open</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.960" end="00:21:37.840" style="s2">the windows but the air quality in our</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.400" end="00:21:40.559" style="s2">entire environment</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.840" end="00:21:41.840" style="s2">um improved and you know often often</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.559" end="00:21:42.880" style="s2">those will be coincident with one</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.840" end="00:21:45.600" style="s2">another but they were</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.880" end="00:21:46.320" style="s2">explicitly um happened within 24 hours</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.600" end="00:21:49.840" style="s2">of one another</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.320" end="00:21:51.760" style="s2">right so um so and as that happened</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.840" end="00:21:52.880" style="s2">all of the problems uh that we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.760" end="00:21:54.720" style="s2">having disappeared</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.880" end="00:21:57.360" style="s2">every single one and so i would i would</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.720" end="00:21:59.919" style="s2">remind people we tried two other cameras</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.360" end="00:22:00.960" style="s2">that only gave us an hdmi output a</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.919" end="00:22:03.679" style="s2">different brand</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.960" end="00:22:05.600" style="s2">two different models they all showed</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.679" end="00:22:06.480" style="s2">this flaw so it was something very</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.600" end="00:22:10.320" style="s2">general</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.480" end="00:22:12.159" style="s2">and the fact of the end of the smoke</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.320" end="00:22:14.159" style="s2">the beginning of the reigns and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.159" end="00:22:15.440" style="s2">opening of the windows all being exactly</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.159" end="00:22:17.760" style="s2">consistent in time</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.440" end="00:22:19.039" style="s2">and being consistent with the end of our</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.760" end="00:22:21.760" style="s2">problems</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.039" end="00:22:22.799" style="s2">uh is very conspicuous in fact i think</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.760" end="00:22:24.559" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.799" end="00:22:26.720" style="s2">highly likely that whatever it was about</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.559" end="00:22:28.400" style="s2">the the reigns triggered all those other</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.720" end="00:22:30.480" style="s2">behaviors and one of them</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.400" end="00:22:32.559" style="s2">fixed our problem so what&#39;s your new</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.480" end="00:22:34.720" style="s2">hypothesis well i don&#39;t want to say</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.559" end="00:22:36.159" style="s2">your new hypothesis because this is you</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.720" end="00:22:37.919" style="s2">generated this hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.159" end="00:22:39.360" style="s2">your new hypothesis does not mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.919" end="00:22:41.360" style="s2">although it is often</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.360" end="00:22:42.640" style="s2">understood to mean in journalism and</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.360" end="00:22:44.480" style="s2">common parlance</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.640" end="00:22:45.919" style="s2">your preferred hypothesis the thing you</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.480" end="00:22:46.480" style="s2">think to be true the thing you want to</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.919" end="00:22:49.440" style="s2">be true</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.480" end="00:22:50.080" style="s2">in this case it is i think neither yep</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.440" end="00:22:52.559" style="s2">right and</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.080" end="00:22:53.760" style="s2">you those so there&#39;s three things you</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.559" end="00:22:56.720" style="s2">generated it</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.760" end="00:22:58.480" style="s2">you generated it you generated it you</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.720" end="00:23:01.600" style="s2">think it&#39;s true you want it to be true</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.480" end="00:23:03.440" style="s2">often um you know often people</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.600" end="00:23:04.799" style="s2">will have a hypothesis of which all</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.440" end="00:23:07.120" style="s2">three of those things are true and</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.799" end="00:23:09.039" style="s2">frankly the scientific method is the way</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.120" end="00:23:10.880" style="s2">of getting rid of the bias around i</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.039" end="00:23:14.159" style="s2">really want this to be true</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.880" end="00:23:16.880" style="s2">the scientific method doesn&#39;t care if uh</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.159" end="00:23:18.559" style="s2">if you generated it um or if you think</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.880" end="00:23:21.840" style="s2">it&#39;s true it shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.559" end="00:23:23.120" style="s2">but the the the bias that the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.840" end="00:23:25.679" style="s2">method the careful application the</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.120" end="00:23:27.919" style="s2">scientific method is supposed to remove</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.679" end="00:23:30.159" style="s2">is anything that you might be doing</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.919" end="00:23:31.120" style="s2">unconsciously or consciously in order to</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.159" end="00:23:33.440" style="s2">get a result</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.120" end="00:23:34.720" style="s2">that you think is true or that you favor</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.440" end="00:23:37.039" style="s2">being true</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.720" end="00:23:39.120" style="s2">right and so to put a finer point on</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.039" end="00:23:39.520" style="s2">this you can generate and in fact it is</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.120" end="00:23:41.840" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.520" end="00:23:43.440" style="s2">practice when you are studying</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.840" end="00:23:45.679" style="s2">scientifically to generate</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.440" end="00:23:47.520" style="s2">every conceivable hypothesis that could</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.679" end="00:23:49.919" style="s2">explain an observation</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.520" end="00:23:51.600" style="s2">and that means that you hold if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.919" end="00:23:53.039" style="s2">going to say these are your hypotheses</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.600" end="00:23:55.120" style="s2">because you generated them all</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.039" end="00:23:56.960" style="s2">the point is you don&#39;t hold one as the</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.120" end="00:23:59.520" style="s2">one you&#39;re rooting for or expecting</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.960" end="00:24:00.799" style="s2">though you may be that&#39;s also possible</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.520" end="00:24:03.200" style="s2">but in this case</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.799" end="00:24:03.840" style="s2">we are left with a hypothesis that i</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.200" end="00:24:06.080" style="s2">find</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.840" end="00:24:07.520" style="s2">possible whether or not i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.080" end="00:24:09.120" style="s2">likely</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.520" end="00:24:10.960" style="s2">we&#39;ll have to talk a little bit more in</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.120" end="00:24:12.640" style="s2">detail and i certainly don&#39;t want it to</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.960" end="00:24:15.919" style="s2">be true</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.640" end="00:24:19.120" style="s2">but here it is the hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.919" end="00:24:22.400" style="s2">is that there was radiation that</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.120" end="00:24:24.880" style="s2">was trapped in our forests</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.400" end="00:24:26.480" style="s2">now at some level that&#39;s automatically</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.880" end="00:24:27.360" style="s2">true we already know that this will be</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.480" end="00:24:29.760" style="s2">true because</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.360" end="00:24:30.559" style="s2">from any event that has released</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.760" end="00:24:32.720" style="s2">radiation</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.559" end="00:24:34.080" style="s2">when the weather carries the particles</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.720" end="00:24:36.000" style="s2">from that event</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.080" end="00:24:37.600" style="s2">over some landscape and then it rains we</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.000" end="00:24:39.120" style="s2">know that rain carries these particles</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.600" end="00:24:41.840" style="s2">to the ground right so</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.120" end="00:24:42.640" style="s2">after a meltdown for example the rains</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.840" end="00:24:44.480" style="s2">nuclear meltdown</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.640" end="00:24:46.080" style="s2">nuclear meltdown you have you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.480" end="00:24:48.880" style="s2">particles released</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.080" end="00:24:49.760" style="s2">you have winds carry them somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.880" end="00:24:51.600" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.760" end="00:24:53.360" style="s2">you know often quite arbitrary and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.600" end="00:24:55.120" style="s2">rains which cause a</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.360" end="00:24:56.960" style="s2">very concentrated danger at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.120" end="00:24:59.039" style="s2">that the particles are</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.960" end="00:25:00.960" style="s2">carried to the ground and concentrated</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.039" end="00:25:02.640" style="s2">but the hypothesis here is that</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.960" end="00:25:04.400" style="s2">radiation</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.640" end="00:25:06.159" style="s2">possibly from something like fukushima</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.400" end="00:25:08.159" style="s2">which we do know</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.159" end="00:25:09.840" style="s2">blew to the pacific northwest that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.159" end="00:25:12.159" style="s2">of the places that it was</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.840" end="00:25:13.600" style="s2">uh that it landed in particular so just</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.159" end="00:25:15.760" style="s2">just a reminder for</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.600" end="00:25:17.760" style="s2">people who don&#39;t most people will</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.760" end="00:25:19.039" style="s2">recognize the word fukushima but perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.760" end="00:25:21.200" style="s2">not have a</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.039" end="00:25:22.799" style="s2">two-sentence description on it you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.200" end="00:25:26.240" style="s2">2011</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.799" end="00:25:27.120" style="s2">uh meltdown following a tsunami triple</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.240" end="00:25:30.159" style="s2">meltdown</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.120" end="00:25:33.360" style="s2">so the fukushima daiichi complex has</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.159" end="00:25:35.440" style="s2">six reactors and seven fuel pools</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.360" end="00:25:36.880" style="s2">spent fuel pools are where the reactor</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.440" end="00:25:41.360" style="s2">cores that have been spent</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.880" end="00:25:43.200" style="s2">go and they for so uh nuclear fuel</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.360" end="00:25:44.400" style="s2">is loaded into these things nuclear fuel</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.200" end="00:25:47.760" style="s2">is a</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.400" end="00:25:49.679" style="s2">a purified radioactive material mostly</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.760" end="00:25:51.440" style="s2">uranium although one of the reactors at</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.679" end="00:25:53.440" style="s2">fukushima was loaded with what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.440" end="00:25:56.480" style="s2">mixed oxide fuel mox</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.440" end="00:25:58.799" style="s2">mox fuel contains uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.480" end="00:26:00.480" style="s2">plutonium from weapons that have been</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.799" end="00:26:02.000" style="s2">decommissioned so it&#39;s basically a</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.480" end="00:26:03.600" style="s2">process of using that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.000" end="00:26:05.360" style="s2">uh so one of the reactors was loaded</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.600" end="00:26:08.880" style="s2">with that but</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.360" end="00:26:11.600" style="s2">the thing that is hard to intuit is that</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.880" end="00:26:13.039" style="s2">the use of the uranium the enriched</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.600" end="00:26:15.919" style="s2">uranium in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.039" end="00:26:16.400" style="s2">uh reactors causes the production of a</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.919" end="00:26:18.240" style="s2">whole</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.400" end="00:26:20.240" style="s2">slew of isotopes that weren&#39;t in it to</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.240" end="00:26:20.880" style="s2">begin with right including lots of</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.240" end="00:26:23.360" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.880" end="00:26:24.320" style="s2">crazy bad stuff like very long-lived</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.360" end="00:26:28.080" style="s2">plutonium</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.320" end="00:26:29.679" style="s2">isotopes with very long half-lives</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.080" end="00:26:31.919" style="s2">and some very short-lived stuff too</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.679" end="00:26:36.640" style="s2">right it produces iodine</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.919" end="00:26:39.679" style="s2">uh i think it&#39;s 152 that has a half</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.640" end="00:26:41.760" style="s2">i know it&#39;s tiny it&#39;s not gonna be no</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.679" end="00:26:42.880" style="s2">um never mind yes one of the iodine</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.760" end="00:26:44.480" style="s2">isotopes and it has an eight day</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.880" end="00:26:46.120" style="s2">half-life which means that it degrades</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.480" end="00:26:47.279" style="s2">very quickly but but it&#39;s actually the</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.120" end="00:26:50.320" style="s2">intermediate-sized</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.279" end="00:26:51.760" style="s2">um elements that are most concerning</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.320" end="00:26:53.679" style="s2">right so</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.760" end="00:26:55.440" style="s2">you&#39;re going to get there but iodine is</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.679" end="00:26:57.039" style="s2">so small and has such a short half-life</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.440" end="00:27:00.320" style="s2">that it is you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.039" end="00:27:02.080" style="s2">nine years later it is mostly not mostly</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.320" end="00:27:05.919" style="s2">not around and concerning</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.080" end="00:27:08.960" style="s2">um as a result of the fukushima meltdown</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.919" end="00:27:10.559" style="s2">uranium plutonium etc are still around</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.960" end="00:27:11.120" style="s2">but probably did not cross the pacific</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.559" end="00:27:13.039" style="s2">ocean</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.120" end="00:27:14.559" style="s2">in at least in in any sort of large</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.039" end="00:27:15.679" style="s2">amounts whereas it&#39;s those intermediate</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.559" end="00:27:18.320" style="s2">sized</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.679" end="00:27:20.320" style="s2">atoms like strontium and cesium which</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.320" end="00:27:23.279" style="s2">would have basically got you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.320" end="00:27:24.080" style="s2">traveled on particulate matter attached</p>

<p begin="00:27:24.080" end="00:27:28.080" style="s2">crossed dropped themselves on the in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.480" end="00:27:30.000" style="s2">pacific northwest why because</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.080" end="00:27:32.080" style="s2">as a as a friend of ours whom i was</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.000" end="00:27:32.640" style="s2">teaching with many years ago once said</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.080" end="00:27:34.159" style="s2">to me</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.640" end="00:27:35.760" style="s2">once described the pacific northwest as</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.159" end="00:27:36.960" style="s2">the windshield of the continent the</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.760" end="00:27:38.320" style="s2">windshield of north america it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.960" end="00:27:40.240" style="s2">perfect description</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.320" end="00:27:41.919" style="s2">and you know jack if you&#39;re out there hi</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.240" end="00:27:44.000" style="s2">from the dark horse podcast yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.919" end="00:27:44.960" style="s2">just it&#39;s it&#39;s such an apt description</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.000" end="00:27:46.880" style="s2">and it really does</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.960" end="00:27:48.480" style="s2">it helps it helps us understand so much</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.880" end="00:27:50.799" style="s2">about our climate our weather</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.480" end="00:27:52.159" style="s2">our biota to some degree even our</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.799" end="00:27:54.000" style="s2">culture at least certainly</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.159" end="00:27:55.360" style="s2">pre-columbian cultures here but but i</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.000" end="00:27:57.919" style="s2">digress</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.360" end="00:27:59.440" style="s2">so the windshield of the continent</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.919" end="00:28:01.360" style="s2">collects all of this weather that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.440" end="00:28:02.480" style="s2">blowing over the pacific and nine years</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.360" end="00:28:05.200" style="s2">ago that weather</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.480" end="00:28:06.880" style="s2">included um a lot of radioactive</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.200" end="00:28:09.200" style="s2">strontium and cesium</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.880" end="00:28:10.080" style="s2">that then got dropped in rainfall into</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.200" end="00:28:13.360" style="s2">our forests</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.080" end="00:28:16.960" style="s2">so strontium and caesium are</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.360" end="00:28:20.480" style="s2">both also</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.960" end="00:28:23.279" style="s2">front of mind because they each mimic</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.480" end="00:28:24.720" style="s2">an element that we use physiologically</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.279" end="00:28:25.679" style="s2">so if you eat something that has</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.720" end="00:28:27.919" style="s2">radioactive</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.679" end="00:28:29.919" style="s2">strontium in it it&#39;s very likely i</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.919" end="00:28:31.279" style="s2">believe strontium goes to bones and</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.919" end="00:28:33.760" style="s2">lodges itself there</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.279" end="00:28:35.919" style="s2">and cesium goes to muscle so these are</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.760" end="00:28:38.320" style="s2">bio biotically dangerous because we</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.919" end="00:28:40.159" style="s2">metabolize them and build them into our</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.320" end="00:28:41.600" style="s2">uh our bodily structure but i mean</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.159" end="00:28:43.039" style="s2">iodine is obviously</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.600" end="00:28:44.799" style="s2">very biologically dangerous as well for</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.039" end="00:28:47.200" style="s2">thyroid fibroids exactly</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.799" end="00:28:48.880" style="s2">so but you can replace so this is the</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.200" end="00:28:50.799" style="s2">reason actually you can replace if you</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.880" end="00:28:52.559" style="s2">know that you might be at risk of being</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.799" end="00:28:54.399" style="s2">dosed by radioactive iodine</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.559" end="00:28:56.480" style="s2">you can take non-radioactive iodine</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.399" end="00:28:58.320" style="s2">effectively fill up your</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.480" end="00:28:59.279" style="s2">your bucket your iodine bucket fill the</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.320" end="00:29:01.200" style="s2">fiber right in there and leave the</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.279" end="00:29:02.320" style="s2">radioactive iodine no place to bind to</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.200" end="00:29:05.440" style="s2">in your thyroid</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.320" end="00:29:07.039" style="s2">um until the risk is passed exactly okay</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.440" end="00:29:08.799" style="s2">but you can&#39;t buy bottles of</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.039" end="00:29:10.559" style="s2">non-radioactive strontium and cesium the</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.799" end="00:29:11.919" style="s2">way you can buy bottles of donative</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.559" end="00:29:13.760" style="s2">iodine well it doesn&#39;t really work that</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.919" end="00:29:15.360" style="s2">way because the thyroid</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.760" end="00:29:17.039" style="s2">is functioning differently right so</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.360" end="00:29:17.600" style="s2">building into bone is a long-term</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.039" end="00:29:19.760" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.600" end="00:29:21.120" style="s2">that you&#39;re constantly doing and so</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.760" end="00:29:23.279" style="s2">anyway um</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.120" end="00:29:25.200" style="s2">cesium and strontium oh and also there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.279" end="00:29:26.240" style="s2">another way that these things could get</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.200" end="00:29:28.399" style="s2">into our forests</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.240" end="00:29:30.080" style="s2">right which is actually again these</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.399" end="00:29:32.159" style="s2">things again being radioactive iso</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.080" end="00:29:33.760" style="s2">radioactive isotopes of strontium and</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.159" end="00:29:35.440" style="s2">season that&#39;s what these things mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.760" end="00:29:37.120" style="s2">radioactive isotopes of cesium and</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.440" end="00:29:39.039" style="s2">strontium could get into our forest in</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.120" end="00:29:40.799" style="s2">the following way</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.039" end="00:29:42.320" style="s2">they don&#39;t even have to come here by</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.799" end="00:29:44.880" style="s2">wind they could wash</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.320" end="00:29:46.480" style="s2">off the shores of japan right because a</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.880" end="00:29:48.399" style="s2">lot of the stuff landed in japan</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.480" end="00:29:49.679" style="s2">as well they could wash off the shores</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.399" end="00:29:51.679" style="s2">of of japan</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.679" end="00:29:54.080" style="s2">and into the pacific they could find</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.679" end="00:29:57.120" style="s2">themselves incorporated into fish</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.080" end="00:29:57.840" style="s2">right especially tuna were tested at the</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.120" end="00:30:01.440" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.840" end="00:30:03.360" style="s2">and were very likely to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.440" end="00:30:04.480" style="s2">uh containing radioactive isotopes from</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.360" end="00:30:08.080" style="s2">fukushima</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.480" end="00:30:08.720" style="s2">also salmon and the thing is salmon have</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.080" end="00:30:11.840" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.720" end="00:30:14.000" style="s2">uh obviously ecological habit of</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.840" end="00:30:15.440" style="s2">reproducing in these freshwater</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.000" end="00:30:17.200" style="s2">watersheds</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.440" end="00:30:18.799" style="s2">throughout the pacific northwest right</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.200" end="00:30:19.840" style="s2">in a different state but you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.799" end="00:30:21.760" style="s2">populations</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.840" end="00:30:23.279" style="s2">uh you know the salmon ecology is</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.760" end="00:30:24.640" style="s2">fascinating we should spend a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.279" end="00:30:25.520" style="s2">episodes probably talking about salmon</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.640" end="00:30:27.919" style="s2">at some point</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.520" end="00:30:30.480" style="s2">um but even though there is some actual</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.919" end="00:30:31.840" style="s2">overlap in species of ankarincus which</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.480" end="00:30:32.960" style="s2">is the genus of pacific salmon we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.840" end="00:30:36.320" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.960" end="00:30:37.919" style="s2">um there aren&#39;t it would be</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.320" end="00:30:39.360" style="s2">we have a lot to say about what happens</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.919" end="00:30:40.559" style="s2">when salmon get lost and how they found</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.360" end="00:30:41.919" style="s2">new populations</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.559" end="00:30:43.279" style="s2">but getting lost from japan and ending</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.919" end="00:30:44.640" style="s2">up at the pacific northwest no</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.279" end="00:30:45.520" style="s2">individual salmon is going to get that</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.640" end="00:30:47.600" style="s2">lost and survived</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.520" end="00:30:49.360" style="s2">i don&#39;t think it&#39;s a matter of lost so</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.600" end="00:30:50.480" style="s2">the salmon typically spends something</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.360" end="00:30:52.880" style="s2">like four years</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.480" end="00:30:53.520" style="s2">at sea and i believe we know that many</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.880" end="00:30:56.159" style="s2">salmon</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.520" end="00:30:57.279" style="s2">that come from our watersheds do range</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.159" end="00:30:59.519" style="s2">as far as japan</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.279" end="00:31:00.880" style="s2">and then come back in okay i don&#39;t i</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.519" end="00:31:02.880" style="s2">don&#39;t know this to be true</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.880" end="00:31:04.640" style="s2">we will soon find out when all of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.880" end="00:31:07.600" style="s2">ichthyology types</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.640" end="00:31:08.399" style="s2">contact us but in any case the reason i</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.600" end="00:31:10.399" style="s2">mention it</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.399" end="00:31:11.600" style="s2">is that it is actually it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.399" end="00:31:14.000" style="s2">counter-intuitive but</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.600" end="00:31:14.960" style="s2">true that the riparian zones that is to</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.000" end="00:31:18.320" style="s2">say the forest</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.960" end="00:31:20.000" style="s2">adjacent to these watersheds</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.320" end="00:31:21.679" style="s2">for riparian zones specifically being</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.000" end="00:31:22.240" style="s2">forest adjacent to streams and rivers</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.679" end="00:31:24.799" style="s2">fast</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.240" end="00:31:26.080" style="s2">moving water as opposed to watershed is</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.799" end="00:31:28.480" style="s2">just the whole</p>

<p begin="00:31:28.480" end="00:31:31.760" style="s2">watershed so they it contain</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.080" end="00:31:33.600" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter that the fact is you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.760" end="00:31:35.840" style="s2">got these streams and rivers</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.600" end="00:31:37.840" style="s2">in which salmon move up and they</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.840" end="00:31:40.399" style="s2">actually change the ecology of these</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.840" end="00:31:43.679" style="s2">forests because they do materially alter</p>

<p begin="00:31:47.279" end="00:31:51.279" style="s2">things drag their carcasses</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.039" end="00:31:52.399" style="s2">into the forest some distance and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.279" end="00:31:54.240" style="s2">whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.399" end="00:31:55.760" style="s2">uh that was in those animals makes its</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.240" end="00:31:56.240" style="s2">way into the soil and then into the</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.760" end="00:31:58.320" style="s2">trees</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.240" end="00:32:00.640" style="s2">so just this was this is one of the real</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.320" end="00:32:02.799" style="s2">successes i think of ecology from the</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.640" end="00:32:04.640" style="s2">90s and early aughts was this concept of</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.799" end="00:32:06.880" style="s2">marine derived nutrients</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.640" end="00:32:08.399" style="s2">in terrestrial forests terrestrial</p>

<p begin="00:32:08.399" end="00:32:11.039" style="s2">um i guess kelp forest so i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.000" end="00:32:11.440" style="s2">talking about kelp forests i&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.039" end="00:32:13.519" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.440" end="00:32:15.279" style="s2">marine derived nutrients in what all of</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.519" end="00:32:17.919" style="s2">us think of when we think of forests</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.279" end="00:32:19.679" style="s2">is exactly it happens exactly as you</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.919" end="00:32:20.880" style="s2">just described and specifically nitrogen</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.679" end="00:32:23.279" style="s2">was tracked</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.880" end="00:32:24.240" style="s2">nitrogen was tracked um because it</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.279" end="00:32:26.080" style="s2">because it</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.240" end="00:32:27.840" style="s2">like like everything decays at a certain</p>

<p begin="00:32:27.840" end="00:32:32.080" style="s2">the the fact of nitrogen that had been</p>

<p begin="00:32:32.080" end="00:32:38.320" style="s2">um be findable and trackable in</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.120" end="00:32:40.880" style="s2">um in furs and in in doug furs</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.320" end="00:32:42.240" style="s2">in the pacific northwest and in bears</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.880" end="00:32:44.799" style="s2">and in other things that</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.240" end="00:32:46.080" style="s2">end up not only eating the salmon</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.799" end="00:32:50.000" style="s2">directly as bears</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.080" end="00:32:52.399" style="s2">do in some cases but being effectively</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.000" end="00:32:53.840" style="s2">downstream of the effects of the corpses</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.399" end="00:32:56.159" style="s2">of the salmon that decay</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.840" end="00:32:58.000" style="s2">and move their marine derived nutrients</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.159" end="00:33:00.799" style="s2">including nitrogen into the soil</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.000" end="00:33:01.279" style="s2">into the foliage browsed by deer you</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.799" end="00:33:03.519" style="s2">know so</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.279" end="00:33:05.279" style="s2">this you know this this nitrogen that</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.519" end="00:33:06.320" style="s2">was in the middle of the pacific ocean</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.279" end="00:33:08.880" style="s2">not too long ago</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.320" end="00:33:10.480" style="s2">is now living in some deer in idaho and</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.880" end="00:33:11.519" style="s2">we actually have a decent sense of how</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.480" end="00:33:14.000" style="s2">that happened</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.519" end="00:33:15.120" style="s2">yes and it&#39;s an amazing story right so</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.000" end="00:33:17.440" style="s2">you can imagine</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.120" end="00:33:18.240" style="s2">uh you know if you if the nitrogen were</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.440" end="00:33:19.679" style="s2">color-coded</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.240" end="00:33:21.760" style="s2">and you were looking down on a map</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.679" end="00:33:22.240" style="s2">there&#39;s some big pulse in the fall as</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.760" end="00:33:24.159" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.240" end="00:33:25.919" style="s2">you know salmon species returns to a</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.159" end="00:33:27.760" style="s2">given river and then</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.919" end="00:33:29.760" style="s2">it moves out into the immediately</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.760" end="00:33:32.080" style="s2">adjacent space as these dead carcasses</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.760" end="00:33:34.159" style="s2">get washed around and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.080" end="00:33:36.000" style="s2">it gets moved farther by big animals</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.159" end="00:33:38.799" style="s2">like bears that might drag the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.000" end="00:33:40.799" style="s2">farther than that um you know the bear</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.799" end="00:33:43.679" style="s2">shits in the woods yes they do</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.799" end="00:33:44.159" style="s2">and uh you know flies might carry a</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.679" end="00:33:45.840" style="s2">little bit</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.159" end="00:33:47.600" style="s2">you know a little bit farther afield so</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.840" end="00:33:48.480" style="s2">you can imagine these nutrients moving</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.600" end="00:33:51.039" style="s2">out of these</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.480" end="00:33:52.480" style="s2">rivers right and that this is a process</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.039" end="00:33:54.640" style="s2">that actually is an equilibrium that</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.480" end="00:33:55.760" style="s2">replenishes the nutrients that are lost</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.640" end="00:33:57.760" style="s2">from all of the stuff that washed</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.760" end="00:34:00.720" style="s2">downstream and into the oceans</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.760" end="00:34:01.360" style="s2">all right beautiful so there is all of</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.720" end="00:34:04.880" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.360" end="00:34:06.960" style="s2">there is 2011 triple</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.880" end="00:34:09.359" style="s2">meltdown less beautiful so much less</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.960" end="00:34:12.399" style="s2">beautiful triple meltdown at fukushima</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.359" end="00:34:15.280" style="s2">dumps a lot of stuff into the ocean</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.399" end="00:34:17.119" style="s2">um and a lot of stuff blows in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.280" end="00:34:18.480" style="s2">atmosphere due to the particular weather</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.119" end="00:34:20.639" style="s2">in the days following</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.480" end="00:34:21.520" style="s2">that blew into the pacific northwest</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.639" end="00:34:24.159" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.520" end="00:34:24.800" style="s2">so here&#39;s the hypothesis the hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.159" end="00:34:27.200" style="s2">and it is</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.800" end="00:34:29.760" style="s2">known is is it known that i thought you</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.200" end="00:34:32.320" style="s2">would also say that it was known that</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.760" end="00:34:34.159" style="s2">um there was particulate matter</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.320" end="00:34:35.520" style="s2">including radiation from fukushima</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.159" end="00:34:37.440" style="s2">that did blow into the pacific northwest</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.520" end="00:34:40.079" style="s2">and the weeks thereafter that was</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.440" end="00:34:41.040" style="s2">known absolutely and at some point</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.079" end="00:34:43.520" style="s2">crazily</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.040" end="00:34:45.200" style="s2">and not reported on enough data actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.520" end="00:34:48.159" style="s2">stopped being collected</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.200" end="00:34:49.040" style="s2">right so but but this was we we know</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.159" end="00:34:50.720" style="s2">this to be true</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.040" end="00:34:52.320" style="s2">that&#39;s right we know this to be true um</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.720" end="00:34:53.760" style="s2">we know this to be true and if i recall</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.320" end="00:34:57.440" style="s2">correctly the methodology</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.760" end="00:34:58.240" style="s2">involved the air filters of automobiles</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.440" end="00:35:00.560" style="s2">which trapped</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.240" end="00:35:02.079" style="s2">in japan right in the pacific northwest</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.560" end="00:35:04.640" style="s2">that trapped radioactive</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.079" end="00:35:06.560" style="s2">particles and so if you could get a</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.640" end="00:35:08.400" style="s2">filter from somebody&#39;s car that they had</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.560" end="00:35:10.720" style="s2">driven during those weeks</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.400" end="00:35:12.640" style="s2">and then you um you know i think the</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.720" end="00:35:14.400" style="s2">methodology involved laying it down on a</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.640" end="00:35:17.040" style="s2">piece of photographic</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.400" end="00:35:18.800" style="s2">paper that was sensitive then the little</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.040" end="00:35:21.040" style="s2">disintegrations the nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.800" end="00:35:23.119" style="s2">disintegrations that happen would result</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.040" end="00:35:24.480" style="s2">in a black spot on the film</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.119" end="00:35:26.560" style="s2">right and you compare that to the</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.480" end="00:35:27.520" style="s2">filters of cars that had not been driven</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.560" end="00:35:30.079" style="s2">during those weeks</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.520" end="00:35:31.040" style="s2">right and the fact is it varies based on</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.079" end="00:35:32.800" style="s2">very local</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.040" end="00:35:34.079" style="s2">weather patterns you know it rains here</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.800" end="00:35:36.160" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t rain there</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.079" end="00:35:38.320" style="s2">you get a pulse the air clears over</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.160" end="00:35:38.640" style="s2">there and so the cars aren&#39;t inhaling it</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.320" end="00:35:41.119" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.640" end="00:35:42.400" style="s2">the particular weather matters a lot but</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.119" end="00:35:45.040" style="s2">okay but we know it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.400" end="00:35:45.760" style="s2">fascinating that um that the methodology</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.040" end="00:35:47.280" style="s2">involved</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.760" end="00:35:48.800" style="s2">effectively looking at the respiratory</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.280" end="00:35:51.119" style="s2">structures of cars right right</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.800" end="00:35:52.079" style="s2">the respiratory system and it&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.119" end="00:35:55.760" style="s2">what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.079" end="00:35:56.079" style="s2">right um so and you know right down to</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.760" end="00:35:58.480" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.079" end="00:36:00.000" style="s2">point why does a car breathe right a car</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.480" end="00:36:03.680" style="s2">is breathing in</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.000" end="00:36:05.440" style="s2">oxygen in order to fuel combustion</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.680" end="00:36:07.359" style="s2">which is what causes it to go and we</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.440" end="00:36:08.240" style="s2">could say the exact same thing about you</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.359" end="00:36:09.839" style="s2">the difference is</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.240" end="00:36:11.680" style="s2">your combustion isn&#39;t fire it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.839" end="00:36:13.839" style="s2">chemical combustion without flame</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.680" end="00:36:15.359" style="s2">but nonetheless same damn process that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.839" end="00:36:18.240" style="s2">respiration is</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.359" end="00:36:20.079" style="s2">gas exchange gas exchange so in animals</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.240" end="00:36:22.640" style="s2">it looks one way and plants it looks</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.079" end="00:36:23.839" style="s2">almost the opposite in cars it looks a</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.640" end="00:36:25.920" style="s2">bit different yet</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.839" end="00:36:27.200" style="s2">but it&#39;s all a kind of respiration it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.920" end="00:36:29.280" style="s2">gas exchange and</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.200" end="00:36:31.200" style="s2">exchange at the molecular level when you</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.280" end="00:36:34.400" style="s2">burn fuel in your car you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.200" end="00:36:37.440" style="s2">you&#39;re burning um you&#39;re burning</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.400" end="00:36:40.800" style="s2">carbon bonds that were</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.440" end="00:36:43.119" style="s2">forged in an ancient peat bog in general</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.800" end="00:36:44.000" style="s2">um part of an ancient dinosaur right</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.119" end="00:36:46.079" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.000" end="00:36:47.599" style="s2">peat bogs generate a lot more so most of</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.079" end="00:36:48.800" style="s2">the gasoline in your car comes from a</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.599" end="00:36:51.520" style="s2">peat bog that got</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.800" end="00:36:52.720" style="s2">uh buried and you know turned into crude</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.520" end="00:36:54.640" style="s2">oil over time but anyway</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.720" end="00:36:56.480" style="s2">photosynthesis captured the energy from</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.640" end="00:36:57.119" style="s2">the sun loaded it into these bonds</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.480" end="00:36:58.880" style="s2">between</p>

<p begin="00:36:58.880" end="00:37:02.480" style="s2">for millions of years somebody</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.480" end="00:37:04.480" style="s2">you know drills it refines it puts it in</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.480" end="00:37:05.839" style="s2">your car and you release the energy from</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.480" end="00:37:06.720" style="s2">the sun that was trapped in these</p>

<p begin="00:37:06.720" end="00:37:10.640" style="s2">through combustion just the same way if</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.480" end="00:37:12.160" style="s2">you eat a carrot you then internally</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.640" end="00:37:13.280" style="s2">release the energy that was stored by</p>

<p begin="00:37:13.280" end="00:37:17.839" style="s2">you know in the carbon bonds um to fuel</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.160" end="00:37:18.560" style="s2">motion and other things that require</p>

<p begin="00:37:18.560" end="00:37:21.520" style="s2">it&#39;s uh it&#39;s a lot less energy that you</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.240" end="00:37:22.160" style="s2">require and that you&#39;re releasing from</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.520" end="00:37:24.400" style="s2">the carrot</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.160" end="00:37:25.520" style="s2">right but i always uh when i was</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.400" end="00:37:28.560" style="s2">teaching i love to</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.520" end="00:37:30.960" style="s2">talk about my fusion powered bicycle</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.560" end="00:37:32.480" style="s2">um because my bicycle actually is fusion</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.960" end="00:37:34.560" style="s2">powered um as is yours</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.480" end="00:37:35.599" style="s2">uh because basically the point is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.560" end="00:37:37.359" style="s2">fusion in the sun</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.599" end="00:37:38.880" style="s2">that releases the energy that gets</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.359" end="00:37:42.000" style="s2">captured by the</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.880" end="00:37:44.880" style="s2">carrot or the stock of wheat or the cow</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.000" end="00:37:46.480" style="s2">ultimately yes yeah um and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.880" end="00:37:50.320" style="s2">you release it and so your</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.480" end="00:37:53.520" style="s2">fusion energy in it yeah sun to grass to</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.320" end="00:37:55.760" style="s2">cow to your plate to you to fueling your</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.520" end="00:37:57.440" style="s2">bicycle fueling my bicycle right bicycle</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.760" end="00:37:59.119" style="s2">okay so we are now far afield from the</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.440" end="00:38:00.400" style="s2">tech failure and the hypothesis that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.119" end="00:38:04.079" style="s2">good but the hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.400" end="00:38:05.440" style="s2">is yes radioactive material</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.079" end="00:38:07.040" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t have to be from fukushima it</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.440" end="00:38:08.079" style="s2">could be from an earlier event like</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.040" end="00:38:09.680" style="s2">weapons tests</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.079" end="00:38:10.800" style="s2">but we know there to have been a pulse</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.680" end="00:38:12.640" style="s2">we know that there was a pulse from</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.800" end="00:38:16.640" style="s2">fukushima right</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.640" end="00:38:18.480" style="s2">whatever pulses it was then drifted</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.640" end="00:38:19.760" style="s2">rains dropped stuff onto the ground</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.480" end="00:38:21.280" style="s2">which we also know happened</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.760" end="00:38:22.800" style="s2">it happened in particular places and not</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.280" end="00:38:24.160" style="s2">other places right you would have to go</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.800" end="00:38:25.440" style="s2">back and look at the exact weather</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.160" end="00:38:26.240" style="s2">pattern to know where it landed and</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.440" end="00:38:29.839" style="s2">where it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.240" end="00:38:31.599" style="s2">but a fire that then burns the plants</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.839" end="00:38:33.440" style="s2">that will have incorporated these</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.599" end="00:38:35.440" style="s2">radioactive isotopes</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.440" end="00:38:36.960" style="s2">would then release that radiation into</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.440" end="00:38:38.560" style="s2">the air and so you just i think you just</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.960" end="00:38:40.160" style="s2">skipped one piece that will be obvious</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.560" end="00:38:40.800" style="s2">to many but not to everyone which is</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.160" end="00:38:44.160" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.800" end="00:38:46.640" style="s2">uh a pulse that that comes our way</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.160" end="00:38:48.400" style="s2">that drops to the ground is then pulled</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.640" end="00:38:50.079" style="s2">up by the roots of plants because it</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.400" end="00:38:53.200" style="s2">becomes part of the soil because</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.079" end="00:38:55.040" style="s2">it&#39;s tiny it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s atomic isotopes</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.200" end="00:38:57.040" style="s2">that are bonded to little pieces of dust</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.040" end="00:38:59.440" style="s2">that are themselves incorporated</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.040" end="00:39:00.720" style="s2">into into the root systems because that</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.440" end="00:39:01.680" style="s2">is not the breathing the breathing is</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.720" end="00:39:04.880" style="s2">through the leaves</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.680" end="00:39:06.160" style="s2">um but the eating uh is in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.880" end="00:39:08.320" style="s2">not the sugars which is through the</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.160" end="00:39:09.599" style="s2">leaves but uh is um</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.320" end="00:39:10.720" style="s2">is through the roots right the</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.599" end="00:39:12.160" style="s2">micronutrients are pulled up</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.720" end="00:39:13.520" style="s2">micronutrients nutrients will be pulled</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.160" end="00:39:14.240" style="s2">up through the roots incorporated into</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.520" end="00:39:15.760" style="s2">the plants</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.240" end="00:39:16.880" style="s2">yeah um you could detect it in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.760" end="00:39:18.480" style="s2">plants and i&#39;m sure people have done</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.880" end="00:39:19.520" style="s2">that work occasionally</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.480" end="00:39:21.680" style="s2">yeah we should have looked into that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.520" end="00:39:24.960" style="s2">sure i&#39;m sure they have a parallel</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.680" end="00:39:26.400" style="s2">um parallel piece of information just so</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.960" end="00:39:27.280" style="s2">people understand what these systems are</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.400" end="00:39:30.480" style="s2">like i remember</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.280" end="00:39:32.640" style="s2">nalini who is actually uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.480" end="00:39:34.640" style="s2">scientist in her own right so married to</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.640" end="00:39:35.839" style="s2">jack who was the source of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.640" end="00:39:37.040" style="s2">beautiful quote about this being the</p>

<p begin="00:39:39.200" end="00:39:47.680" style="s2">um so nalini who was an expert on</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.200" end="00:39:47.680" style="s2">mosses and cannon and forced cancer</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.800" end="00:39:54.240" style="s2">talked about the event the</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.240" end="00:39:55.520" style="s2">mount st helens eruption which had</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.240" end="00:39:58.800" style="s2">trapped a layer</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.520" end="00:40:01.359" style="s2">of ash in the mosses that</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.800" end="00:40:03.200" style="s2">persists to this day in our trees and</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.359" end="00:40:04.640" style="s2">has effects so if you go into the canopy</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.200" end="00:40:05.520" style="s2">of trees and you find patches of moths</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.640" end="00:40:07.119" style="s2">that are old enough</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.520" end="00:40:09.760" style="s2">you&#39;ve effectively got this layer of ash</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.119" end="00:40:10.720" style="s2">and it turns out i think i learned this</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.760" end="00:40:14.560" style="s2">from nalini</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.720" end="00:40:17.760" style="s2">that the ash got incorporated</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.560" end="00:40:21.040" style="s2">into the trees and the grit is</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.760" end="00:40:23.920" style="s2">actually causes chainsaw blades to wear</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.040" end="00:40:25.200" style="s2">faster here if you&#39;re cutting trees that</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.920" end="00:40:28.319" style="s2">were downstream of that</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.200" end="00:40:31.359" style="s2">event downstream in time no that got</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.319" end="00:40:34.800" style="s2">ash on downstream in ash yes okay and so</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.359" end="00:40:37.680" style="s2">national ash fell really hard in olympia</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.800" end="00:40:38.319" style="s2">in seattle in portland portland more</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.680" end="00:40:40.800" style="s2">than</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.319" end="00:40:42.560" style="s2">more than seattle yeah and so that ash</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.800" end="00:40:43.119" style="s2">fell in all of these forests and somehow</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.560" end="00:40:46.640" style="s2">the grit</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.119" end="00:40:49.119" style="s2">is uh causing chainsaw blades to uh</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.640" end="00:40:51.200" style="s2">erode faster but anyway an aside so</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.119" end="00:40:53.520" style="s2">here&#39;s the hypothesis the hypothesis is</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.200" end="00:40:55.200" style="s2">something maybe fukushima released</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.520" end="00:40:57.040" style="s2">nuclear radiation in the form of all of</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.200" end="00:40:58.880" style="s2">these isotopes that are created in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.040" end="00:41:01.440" style="s2">heart of a reactor could also be true</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.880" end="00:41:04.720" style="s2">from a weapon</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.440" end="00:41:06.720" style="s2">the material</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.720" end="00:41:08.000" style="s2">fell here as a result of weather having</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.720" end="00:41:10.560" style="s2">it blown this direction</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.000" end="00:41:12.160" style="s2">and rain having caused it to fall to the</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.560" end="00:41:14.400" style="s2">ground gets incorporated into the trees</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.160" end="00:41:16.000" style="s2">a fire event releases this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.400" end="00:41:17.760" style="s2">it will have then been floating in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.000" end="00:41:19.440" style="s2">air and these macroscopic smoke</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.760" end="00:41:20.000" style="s2">particles that were making it so hard to</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.440" end="00:41:22.480" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.000" end="00:41:24.079" style="s2">and to breathe now i don&#39;t think the</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.480" end="00:41:26.000" style="s2">concentrations of those things would</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.079" end="00:41:27.920" style="s2">have been high in our house because we</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.000" end="00:41:29.280" style="s2">sealed off our house and we had a filter</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.920" end="00:41:30.480" style="s2">pulling the smoke particles out of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.280" end="00:41:32.079" style="s2">air at a higher rate</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.480" end="00:41:34.319" style="s2">so there would have been little bursts</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.079" end="00:41:35.839" style="s2">here like atomic radiation like</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.319" end="00:41:37.200" style="s2">at the elemental level would not be</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.839" end="00:41:37.760" style="s2">trapped by hepa felt it would be too</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.200" end="00:41:39.839" style="s2">small</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.760" end="00:41:42.079" style="s2">but the particulate matter that would</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.839" end="00:41:45.040" style="s2">have been released in the form of smoke</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.079" end="00:41:46.560" style="s2">through fire would um would have been</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.040" end="00:41:47.359" style="s2">trapped by a hepa filter so let&#39;s be</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.560" end="00:41:49.280" style="s2">clear about this</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.359" end="00:41:50.720" style="s2">radiation won&#39;t be trapped in any</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.280" end="00:41:53.520" style="s2">circumstance</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.720" end="00:41:55.280" style="s2">an atom a radioactive atom won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.520" end="00:41:56.960" style="s2">trapped because it&#39;s too small right</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.280" end="00:41:58.960" style="s2">right and so we talked on our last</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.960" end="00:42:01.119" style="s2">podcast about radon which is a gas which</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.960" end="00:42:03.680" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be trapped at all by a filter</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.119" end="00:42:05.040" style="s2">right but a particle a radioactive</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.680" end="00:42:07.440" style="s2">particle that is</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.040" end="00:42:08.720" style="s2">in wood or leaves that then gets</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.440" end="00:42:11.440" style="s2">liberated into the air is</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.720" end="00:42:13.280" style="s2">ash that&#39;s now in a macroscopic particle</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.440" end="00:42:15.359" style="s2">and that will get trapped by</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.280" end="00:42:16.880" style="s2">by a filter so my guess is we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.359" end="00:42:18.240" style="s2">have high rates of that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.880" end="00:42:20.640" style="s2">in the house and despite the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.240" end="00:42:22.160" style="s2">the air outside was absolutely choking</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.640" end="00:42:24.079" style="s2">we actually did not have terrible</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.160" end="00:42:25.760" style="s2">respiratory issues in the house</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.079" end="00:42:27.599" style="s2">during that time which suggests that our</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.760" end="00:42:29.680" style="s2">air was pretty clean</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.599" end="00:42:31.760" style="s2">but there&#39;s a question about the</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.680" end="00:42:34.880" style="s2">radiation the ambient radiation</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.760" end="00:42:36.960" style="s2">could the ambient radiation cause first</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.880" end="00:42:38.720" style="s2">of all some radiation will get through</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.960" end="00:42:40.720" style="s2">uh things like walls and windows and</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.720" end="00:42:43.119" style="s2">some won&#39;t so the question is would</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.720" end="00:42:45.280" style="s2">there be ambient radiation</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.119" end="00:42:46.880" style="s2">that would be capable of disrupting our</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.280" end="00:42:48.880" style="s2">podcast system</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.880" end="00:42:51.200" style="s2">in here that would have almost</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.880" end="00:42:52.560" style="s2">immediately ceased or immediately ceased</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.200" end="00:42:55.119" style="s2">as soon as the rains</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.560" end="00:42:55.920" style="s2">pulled the particles out of the air and</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.119" end="00:42:59.119" style="s2">washed them</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.920" end="00:43:01.760" style="s2">into the stream um</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.119" end="00:43:02.640" style="s2">so that is a hypothesis how would you</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.760" end="00:43:05.200" style="s2">test it</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.640" end="00:43:07.280" style="s2">well one thing you could do is and this</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.200" end="00:43:09.040" style="s2">is in theory doable it becomes less</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.280" end="00:43:10.960" style="s2">practical every day</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.040" end="00:43:12.960" style="s2">there are cars that were driven during</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.960" end="00:43:15.040" style="s2">that time we drove both of our vehicles</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.960" end="00:43:18.160" style="s2">during that time though not very much</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.040" end="00:43:19.599" style="s2">those cars will have pulled in a sample</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.160" end="00:43:21.119" style="s2">of what was in the atmosphere and it</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.599" end="00:43:22.880" style="s2">will decay at whatever rate the</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.119" end="00:43:24.480" style="s2">particular isotopes decay at whatever</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.880" end="00:43:27.280" style="s2">their half-life is</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.480" end="00:43:28.160" style="s2">so that would be detectable and cars</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.280" end="00:43:30.640" style="s2">that were</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.160" end="00:43:32.240" style="s2">here but not driven during that time</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.640" end="00:43:32.720" style="s2">won&#39;t have trapped an appreciable amount</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.240" end="00:43:34.880" style="s2">of it</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.720" end="00:43:37.359" style="s2">and so you could test it in that way</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.880" end="00:43:40.000" style="s2">yeah and um</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.359" end="00:43:41.839" style="s2">despite the admittedly very patchy</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.000" end="00:43:44.960" style="s2">presumably patchy distribution</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.839" end="00:43:46.560" style="s2">of radioactive isotopes in the forest of</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.960" end="00:43:48.400" style="s2">the pacific northwest and this</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.560" end="00:43:49.599" style="s2">hypothesis hinges on the idea that at</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.400" end="00:43:50.079" style="s2">least some of the forest i mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.599" end="00:43:52.000" style="s2">such a</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.079" end="00:43:53.200" style="s2">giant spot of forest that burned that at</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.000" end="00:43:54.000" style="s2">least some of those forests would have</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.200" end="00:43:57.520" style="s2">been</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.000" end="00:44:00.319" style="s2">high density of radioactive isotopes</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.520" end="00:44:01.119" style="s2">but you know carefully in a controlled</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.319" end="00:44:03.440" style="s2">fashion</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.119" end="00:44:05.040" style="s2">taking a couple of adjoining trees from</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.440" end="00:44:06.160" style="s2">each of these places and burning them</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.040" end="00:44:10.079" style="s2">into a container</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.160" end="00:44:12.240" style="s2">and measuring uh the radioactivity</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.079" end="00:44:13.760" style="s2">in that in that burn or you know just</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.240" end="00:44:15.760" style="s2">just burning them into a filter and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.760" end="00:44:18.079" style="s2">doing exactly the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.760" end="00:44:18.880" style="s2">so it would not be testing what happened</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.079" end="00:44:21.920" style="s2">but it would be</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.880" end="00:44:23.520" style="s2">a decent way of mimicking what happened</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.920" end="00:44:24.880" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t depend on doing it right</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.520" end="00:44:26.079" style="s2">now you know it doesn&#39;t depend on</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.880" end="00:44:27.760" style="s2">collecting data that are</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.079" end="00:44:29.280" style="s2">aging every day because the fires are in</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.760" end="00:44:30.880" style="s2">the past and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.280" end="00:44:32.880" style="s2">now that you mention it there&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.880" end="00:44:35.280" style="s2">good method that you could deploy here</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.880" end="00:44:36.079" style="s2">which is you could take a round from a</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.280" end="00:44:37.920" style="s2">tree</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.079" end="00:44:39.680" style="s2">right you could buck a tree you can take</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.920" end="00:44:41.200" style="s2">a tree that was near the fires but not</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.680" end="00:44:44.319" style="s2">in them there&#39;s gotta be plenty of that</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.200" end="00:44:46.319" style="s2">right yeah cut it down take a</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.319" end="00:44:48.319" style="s2">a round and now you have tree rings</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.319" end="00:44:50.480" style="s2">which will tell you how long ago a</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.319" end="00:44:51.520" style="s2">deposit was laid down yes so you could</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.480" end="00:44:53.599" style="s2">figure out actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.520" end="00:44:56.000" style="s2">if if there is appreciable radiation</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.599" end="00:44:57.520" style="s2">where it came from where&#39;s the pulse</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.000" end="00:44:59.440" style="s2">um so anyway that would be very</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.520" end="00:45:02.000" style="s2">interesting yeah no and there</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.440" end="00:45:03.040" style="s2">there are a lot of fallen and snag trees</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.000" end="00:45:04.319" style="s2">uh that are</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.040" end="00:45:06.880" style="s2">you know at risk of falling in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.319" end="00:45:08.400" style="s2">coming rains and causing mudslides and</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.880" end="00:45:10.319" style="s2">mudslides that are then more dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.400" end="00:45:10.880" style="s2">because they bring down uh trees as well</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.319" end="00:45:13.119" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.880" end="00:45:14.160" style="s2">there will be lots of such material</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.119" end="00:45:17.200" style="s2">available</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.160" end="00:45:19.680" style="s2">uh for such analysis should someone have</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.200" end="00:45:20.880" style="s2">simply the the time and the resources to</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.680" end="00:45:22.480" style="s2">do it yeah we just</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.880" end="00:45:24.720" style="s2">we don&#39;t have the we don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.480" end="00:45:27.760" style="s2">technology to do such analysis but</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.720" end="00:45:29.119" style="s2">right now i will say the nice thing</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.760" end="00:45:32.000" style="s2">about the methodology</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.119" end="00:45:34.000" style="s2">that you point to is that it doesn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.000" end="00:45:36.800" style="s2">ability to test this doesn&#39;t degrade</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.000" end="00:45:38.560" style="s2">exactly right yeah i mean those the to</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.800" end="00:45:40.720" style="s2">the degree that there are snags and</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.560" end="00:45:42.480" style="s2">fallen trees right now that might</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.720" end="00:45:43.760" style="s2">that might be beginning to be cleaned up</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.480" end="00:45:47.119" style="s2">so as to render</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.760" end="00:45:48.960" style="s2">the probably coming mud slides uh less</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.119" end="00:45:50.160" style="s2">dangerous they might get disappeared a</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.960" end="00:45:52.079" style="s2">little bit but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.160" end="00:45:54.560" style="s2">there&#39;s plenty of stuff to buck up and</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.079" end="00:45:56.640" style="s2">uh and and do this analysis on</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.560" end="00:45:58.000" style="s2">but even if you didn&#39;t you could test so</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.640" end="00:46:01.359" style="s2">with my method</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.000" end="00:46:03.359" style="s2">of the air filters in the cars um</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.359" end="00:46:05.599" style="s2">you can&#39;t do this the farther we get</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.359" end="00:46:06.960" style="s2">from the fire event the less likely it</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.599" end="00:46:08.720" style="s2">is to work because</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.960" end="00:46:11.119" style="s2">cars that were idle will have been</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.720" end="00:46:13.520" style="s2">driven you&#39;ll pollute the data</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.119" end="00:46:14.800" style="s2">but the trees that weren&#39;t burned the</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.520" end="00:46:17.040" style="s2">ones adjacent to these</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.800" end="00:46:18.880" style="s2">areas that did burn just simply retain</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.040" end="00:46:20.400" style="s2">their level of radiation which will</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.880" end="00:46:21.760" style="s2">decay at its natural rate</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.400" end="00:46:24.880" style="s2">i do like the idea of pollution</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.760" end="00:46:24.880" style="s2">polluting the pollution data</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.359" end="00:46:31.200" style="s2">polluting you with noise exactly yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.200" end="00:46:32.240" style="s2">okay so noise that&#39;s the solution data a</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.200" end="00:46:33.920" style="s2">reminder</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.240" end="00:46:35.760" style="s2">i am not saying that i believe that this</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.920" end="00:46:37.280" style="s2">is what happened to our system the truth</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.760" end="00:46:38.400" style="s2">is i don&#39;t know what i believe happened</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.280" end="00:46:39.839" style="s2">to our system</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.400" end="00:46:42.000" style="s2">the reason that i am more likely to</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.839" end="00:46:44.560" style="s2">believe this hypothesis then probably</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.000" end="00:46:45.839" style="s2">anybody listening to this podcast who is</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.560" end="00:46:49.359" style="s2">tracking this</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.839" end="00:46:51.280" style="s2">is that i know that zach and i falsified</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.359" end="00:46:52.640" style="s2">just about everything that was more</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.280" end="00:46:54.640" style="s2">likely than this and</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.640" end="00:46:56.240" style="s2">several times over right the number of</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.640" end="00:46:57.839" style="s2">things that we were able to eliminate</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.240" end="00:46:59.599" style="s2">by just simply swapping in a different</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.839" end="00:47:01.040" style="s2">piece of equipment or testing</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.599" end="00:47:02.720" style="s2">you know something there rather than</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.040" end="00:47:04.960" style="s2">here we falsified</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.720" end="00:47:07.040" style="s2">virtually everything we were left with</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.960" end="00:47:08.880" style="s2">it has to be some kind of interference</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.040" end="00:47:10.319" style="s2">and we do not have a source of</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.880" end="00:47:11.760" style="s2">interference that makes any sense</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.319" end="00:47:13.440" style="s2">nor do we have a source of interference</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.760" end="00:47:15.599" style="s2">that should have gone away at the point</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.440" end="00:47:16.800" style="s2">that the rains came and the smoke</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.599" end="00:47:18.560" style="s2">changed things nor</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.800" end="00:47:20.000" style="s2">had had you guys made changes to the</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.560" end="00:47:20.480" style="s2">system in advance of the problems</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.000" end="00:47:22.240" style="s2">beginning</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.480" end="00:47:23.839" style="s2">nothing and nor did we change anything</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.240" end="00:47:25.760" style="s2">back at the point that they were fixed</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.839" end="00:47:27.839" style="s2">it was insensitive to for example</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.760" end="00:47:29.680" style="s2">humidifying the room so we falsified</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.839" end="00:47:31.040" style="s2">static electricity so we falsified so</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.680" end="00:47:34.000" style="s2">many hypotheses it was almost</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.040" end="00:47:36.160" style="s2">insensitive to applying tinfoil hats</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.000" end="00:47:38.079" style="s2">right exactly which frankly we</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.160" end="00:47:39.599" style="s2">discovered later needed to be grounded</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.079" end="00:47:41.760" style="s2">they would have been much more likely to</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.599" end="00:47:42.400" style="s2">work but and it makes for a better</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.760" end="00:47:44.240" style="s2">visual too</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.400" end="00:47:46.000" style="s2">a grounded tinfoil hat is just even</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.240" end="00:47:49.359" style="s2">better totally yeah it&#39;s not as good as</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.000" end="00:47:49.359" style="s2">a based tinfoil hat but</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.920" end="00:47:53.599" style="s2">all right so that&#39;s it this is</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.480" end="00:47:56.400" style="s2">hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.599" end="00:47:57.760" style="s2">predictions uh we&#39;d love to see a test</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.400" end="00:47:59.200" style="s2">we&#39;d also love to hear from people who</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.760" end="00:47:59.839" style="s2">know more about these topics than we do</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.200" end="00:48:01.760" style="s2">i have cons</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.839" end="00:48:03.359" style="s2">i have contacted one expert who i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.760" end="00:48:04.880" style="s2">hoping will respond and tell us whether</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.359" end="00:48:06.480" style="s2">this is plausible or not</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.880" end="00:48:08.319" style="s2">but anyway people in our audience may</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.480" end="00:48:09.760" style="s2">know too all right</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.319" end="00:48:12.559" style="s2">all right i feel good about that what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.760" end="00:48:14.000" style="s2">next um so</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.559" end="00:48:16.079" style="s2">i mean it&#39;s a little bit of a strange</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.000" end="00:48:17.839" style="s2">segue actually um</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.079" end="00:48:19.599" style="s2">because it goes back into the explicitly</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.839" end="00:48:23.280" style="s2">political and that you know this</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.599" end="00:48:26.640" style="s2">what we what we just did is exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.280" end="00:48:28.559" style="s2">the kind of thing that would emerge</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.640" end="00:48:29.920" style="s2">sort of organically in our classrooms</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.559" end="00:48:31.359" style="s2">whether or not you know that that</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.920" end="00:48:32.640" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have been a topic that i would</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.359" end="00:48:34.880" style="s2">likely have prepared</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.640" end="00:48:37.760" style="s2">content on but it might well have</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.880" end="00:48:40.400" style="s2">emerged and those sorts of conversations</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.760" end="00:48:41.520" style="s2">that describe in real time how it is</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.400" end="00:48:42.880" style="s2">that you would go about trying to figure</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.520" end="00:48:45.359" style="s2">out if something is true</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.880" end="00:48:46.559" style="s2">by using the scientific method and your</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.359" end="00:48:47.680" style="s2">own background knowledge and trying to</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.559" end="00:48:49.599" style="s2">figure out what else you would need to</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.680" end="00:48:52.800" style="s2">know in order to assess all like this</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.599" end="00:48:55.520" style="s2">this is this is the thing that we do</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.800" end="00:48:57.920" style="s2">and that we bring towards all of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.520" end="00:49:00.960" style="s2">questions that um that we try to address</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.920" end="00:49:02.640" style="s2">in life and so i was remembering um you</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.960" end="00:49:04.240" style="s2">know we did an event a live event back</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.640" end="00:49:07.119" style="s2">when live events happened</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.240" end="00:49:07.599" style="s2">in um gosh november of last year maybe</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.119" end="00:49:11.280" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.599" end="00:49:12.559" style="s2">with some here in portland</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.280" end="00:49:14.000" style="s2">and i&#39;m just not gonna remember any of</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.559" end="00:49:15.599" style="s2">the particulars there was a there was a</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.000" end="00:49:17.119" style="s2">screening of a very short documentary</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.599" end="00:49:19.520" style="s2">that had nadine strassen</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.119" end="00:49:20.720" style="s2">the former president of the aclu and cut</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.520" end="00:49:22.880" style="s2">apologies to</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.720" end="00:49:24.400" style="s2">the organization that put it on and the</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.880" end="00:49:26.480" style="s2">host i can&#39;t remember anything i know</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.400" end="00:49:29.760" style="s2">that we were on stage with katie herzog</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.480" end="00:49:32.000" style="s2">who&#39;s awesome former uh journalist with</p>

<p begin="00:49:35.760" end="00:49:41.119" style="s2">and our host uh said to us</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.599" end="00:49:42.720" style="s2">presumably there&#39;s other things you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.119" end="00:49:45.280" style="s2">like to be talking about then</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.720" end="00:49:47.200" style="s2">cancel culture and wokeness and</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.280" end="00:49:48.079" style="s2">postmodernism and all the stuff that we</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.200" end="00:49:49.520" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.079" end="00:49:51.760" style="s2">spent a lot of time talking about in</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.520" end="00:49:53.119" style="s2">this podcast um and that we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.760" end="00:49:55.680" style="s2">about that evening and</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.119" end="00:49:56.880" style="s2">yeah we said ah yes yes actually you</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.680" end="00:49:58.800" style="s2">know we&#39;re working on this book</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.880" end="00:50:00.480" style="s2">it&#39;s about using using evolutionary lens</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.800" end="00:50:03.599" style="s2">to understand uh</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.480" end="00:50:05.599" style="s2">modernity and yes there are so many</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.599" end="00:50:06.960" style="s2">things that we&#39;d rather be talking about</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.599" end="00:50:08.480" style="s2">but of course it&#39;s also true that you</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.960" end="00:50:09.520" style="s2">can use an evolutionary lens to</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.480" end="00:50:13.040" style="s2">understand the</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.520" end="00:50:14.160" style="s2">modern the modern craziness um so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.040" end="00:50:17.520" style="s2">all a little bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.160" end="00:50:18.720" style="s2">uh a disclaimer to say that um</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.520" end="00:50:20.480" style="s2">hey i want to talk a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.720" end="00:50:20.720" style="s2">the modern craziness with judith butler</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.480" end="00:50:24.400" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.720" end="00:50:27.520" style="s2">gender theory and such but first um</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.400" end="00:50:29.200" style="s2">i&#39;ve become really so worried</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.520" end="00:50:31.200" style="s2">i didn&#39;t think it was possible to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.200" end="00:50:35.599" style="s2">more worried about the state of</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.200" end="00:50:35.599" style="s2">political discourse and um</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.920" end="00:50:43.280" style="s2">you know what looks like end of empire</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.599" end="00:50:47.040" style="s2">level actions on all sides</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.280" end="00:50:51.040" style="s2">uh and what i&#39;m seeing now though</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.040" end="00:50:53.200" style="s2">is scaring me more because it looks like</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.040" end="00:50:54.960" style="s2">people on both sides and you can define</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.200" end="00:50:56.880" style="s2">sides a lot of ways but for the moment</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.960" end="00:51:00.480" style="s2">let&#39;s just call it left and right</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.880" end="00:51:01.440" style="s2">um and the sort of not just the woke</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.480" end="00:51:04.240" style="s2">left but</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.440" end="00:51:06.559" style="s2">almost all of the dams not all of us to</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.240" end="00:51:09.119" style="s2">the degree that we&#39;re still democrats</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.559" end="00:51:10.800" style="s2">but almost all the dems see are willing</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.119" end="00:51:12.640" style="s2">to go along with the story</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.800" end="00:51:13.839" style="s2">that trump and the far right and white</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.640" end="00:51:15.760" style="s2">nationalists and all</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.839" end="00:51:17.040" style="s2">are going to usher in an authoritarian</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.760" end="00:51:19.520" style="s2">fascistic era</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.040" end="00:51:20.839" style="s2">right like that is the analysis that you</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.520" end="00:51:24.319" style="s2">see in here</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.839" end="00:51:26.160" style="s2">in wapo and new york times and cnn and</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.319" end="00:51:28.720" style="s2">msnbc and all this</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.160" end="00:51:30.160" style="s2">and similarly many on the right are</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.720" end="00:51:32.240" style="s2">convinced that intersectionality and</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.160" end="00:51:33.200" style="s2">post-modernism and utopian and communist</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.240" end="00:51:36.800" style="s2">fantasies</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.200" end="00:51:37.440" style="s2">of a perfect don&#39;t know unicorn-filled</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.800" end="00:51:39.839" style="s2">future</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.440" end="00:51:41.760" style="s2">will usher in an authoritarian fascistic</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.839" end="00:51:43.280" style="s2">era and it&#39;s really it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.760" end="00:51:44.559" style="s2">language so i found myself a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.280" end="00:51:47.520" style="s2">times this week</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.559" end="00:51:48.480" style="s2">um reading you know an analysis of for</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.520" end="00:51:51.760" style="s2">instance</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.480" end="00:51:53.119" style="s2">a horrifying true tale from yes nazi</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.760" end="00:51:55.839" style="s2">germany</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.119" end="00:51:57.280" style="s2">and in one case it arrived at see this</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.839" end="00:51:59.680" style="s2">is what&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.280" end="00:52:01.599" style="s2">if you vote for trump another case that</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.680" end="00:52:03.200" style="s2">arrived at see this is what&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.599" end="00:52:04.480" style="s2">if you vote for biden and they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.200" end="00:52:06.559" style="s2">exactly the same stories but they were</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.480" end="00:52:10.240" style="s2">effectively the same stories</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.559" end="00:52:13.040" style="s2">so i don&#39;t think we know</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.240" end="00:52:14.640" style="s2">what we i don&#39;t think anyone now knows</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.040" end="00:52:17.040" style="s2">what they look like to the other</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.640" end="00:52:18.160" style="s2">i think we are we are being we are being</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.040" end="00:52:21.200" style="s2">fed</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.160" end="00:52:23.680" style="s2">not just untruths about the other</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.200" end="00:52:24.800" style="s2">but we are seeing ourselves reflected in</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.680" end="00:52:27.280" style="s2">a way that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.800" end="00:52:28.000" style="s2">doesn&#39;t even remind us of ourselves very</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.280" end="00:52:30.640" style="s2">often</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.000" end="00:52:32.000" style="s2">and i the this you know this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.640" end="00:52:33.599" style="s2">a term that i guess daniel</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.000" end="00:52:34.160" style="s2">schwartenberger has used a lot but this</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.599" end="00:52:36.559" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.160" end="00:52:38.400" style="s2">the the the decline of sense making the</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.559" end="00:52:39.359" style="s2">inability to do sense making when we</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.400" end="00:52:40.960" style="s2">used to know</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.359" end="00:52:43.040" style="s2">how to do it from some combination of</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.960" end="00:52:43.839" style="s2">first principles and trusting particular</p>

<p begin="00:52:43.839" end="00:52:47.359" style="s2">and you know there was a newspaper and</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.680" end="00:52:49.040" style="s2">of record and it did hold itself to</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.359" end="00:52:50.800" style="s2">account and all of these things</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.040" end="00:52:52.240" style="s2">without any of those what we&#39;re left</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.800" end="00:52:55.040" style="s2">with is first principles</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.240" end="00:52:55.440" style="s2">and even that given that aside from what</p>

<p begin="00:53:04.400" end="00:53:08.480" style="s2">and therein we land at male is female</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.720" end="00:53:10.079" style="s2">and two plus two was five and you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.480" end="00:53:12.319" style="s2">all of this nonsense</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.079" end="00:53:13.359" style="s2">that really does suggest that we&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.319" end="00:53:15.520" style="s2">the end of</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.359" end="00:53:17.119" style="s2">of the ability to determine what&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.520" end="00:53:21.599" style="s2">and what&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.119" end="00:53:23.280" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s uh um the</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.599" end="00:53:25.040" style="s2">the i don&#39;t know is the wheels coming</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.280" end="00:53:26.559" style="s2">off the apple cart a mixed metaphor or</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.040" end="00:53:30.000" style="s2">do i have it right but</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.559" end="00:53:33.559" style="s2">um so a couple things i would say is</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.000" end="00:53:36.079" style="s2">one you know in biology</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.559" end="00:53:36.800" style="s2">homeostasis right the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.079" end="00:53:40.640" style="s2">continue</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.800" end="00:53:43.359" style="s2">on for a creature or a cell or anything</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.640" end="00:53:44.960" style="s2">is the result of the maintenance of</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.359" end="00:53:48.880" style="s2">conditions between</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.960" end="00:53:51.280" style="s2">certain bounds right so for us</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.880" end="00:53:52.720" style="s2">endotherms so-called warm-blooded</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.280" end="00:53:55.440" style="s2">creatures</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.720" end="00:53:56.559" style="s2">our temperature is maintained within a</p>

<p begin="00:54:02.960" end="00:54:07.200" style="s2">your temperature goes up</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.400" end="00:54:08.800" style="s2">too high then the point is well your</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.200" end="00:54:10.000" style="s2">enzymes are just molecules and their</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.800" end="00:54:11.760" style="s2">shape will actually change</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.000" end="00:54:13.119" style="s2">based on how warm and chaotic the</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.760" end="00:54:15.280" style="s2">environment is so</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.119" end="00:54:17.760" style="s2">your temperature is not arbitrarily</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.280" end="00:54:19.520" style="s2">chosen it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.760" end="00:54:21.040" style="s2">tightly matched to the enzymes in</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.520" end="00:54:21.839" style="s2">question and for those of us who are</p>

<p begin="00:54:21.839" end="00:54:26.079" style="s2">which has evolved twice more depending</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.559" end="00:54:28.079" style="s2">on how you count but twice</p>

<p begin="00:54:30.480" end="00:54:36.480" style="s2">that temperature is made created</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.599" end="00:54:38.559" style="s2">and maintained internally we can&#39;t look</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.480" end="00:54:41.280" style="s2">outside of us to</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.559" end="00:54:42.640" style="s2">to to to maintain our own heat and</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.280" end="00:54:45.280" style="s2">obviously we do</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.640" end="00:54:47.839" style="s2">you know we do feel warm in the sun and</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.280" end="00:54:49.680" style="s2">feel cold in the cold but</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.839" end="00:54:51.280" style="s2">it is our bodies that are doing the</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.680" end="00:54:53.040" style="s2">homeostatic work</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.280" end="00:54:54.799" style="s2">uh and you know whereas if you&#39;re if</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.040" end="00:54:57.040" style="s2">you&#39;re if you&#39;re a lizard you have a</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.799" end="00:54:58.160" style="s2">much wider range of possibilities and</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.040" end="00:55:00.160" style="s2">you know at some level i don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.160" end="00:55:02.400" style="s2">this is where you were going but um</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.160" end="00:55:04.640" style="s2">it almost feels like people are playing</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.400" end="00:55:06.880" style="s2">around with the homeostatic</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.640" end="00:55:08.240" style="s2">levers of society to such a great degree</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.880" end="00:55:09.760" style="s2">that they&#39;re imagining that like we&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.240" end="00:55:10.400" style="s2">lizard it&#39;ll be fine it&#39;s like no you</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.760" end="00:55:12.319" style="s2">know what</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.400" end="00:55:13.520" style="s2">we can&#39;t function within that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.319" end="00:55:15.520" style="s2">range we&#39;re like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.520" end="00:55:17.520" style="s2">this our society is an endothermic</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.520" end="00:55:20.400" style="s2">society not an ectothermic one and</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.520" end="00:55:22.000" style="s2">we we need certain bounds to exist</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.400" end="00:55:25.280" style="s2">within which</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.000" end="00:55:27.520" style="s2">homeostasis is possible outside of which</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.280" end="00:55:29.200" style="s2">all bets are off just you know all</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.520" end="00:55:31.040" style="s2">systems start to go haywire and they</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.200" end="00:55:34.160" style="s2">will act in unpredictable ways i mean</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.040" end="00:55:35.440" style="s2">we know this with things like um we know</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.160" end="00:55:36.000" style="s2">this with things like climate we know</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.440" end="00:55:37.760" style="s2">this is</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.000" end="00:55:39.920" style="s2">with things like policing like both of</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.760" end="00:55:42.319" style="s2">them totally different systems but</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.920" end="00:55:43.200" style="s2">um you know you pull the levers too far</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.319" end="00:55:44.559" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.200" end="00:55:46.640" style="s2">you can&#39;t predict what comes next</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.559" end="00:55:48.160" style="s2">accurately so this this is more or less</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.640" end="00:55:50.640" style="s2">what i was going to say is</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.160" end="00:55:52.799" style="s2">what we effectively are seeing are two</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.640" end="00:55:55.119" style="s2">sides that are advocating</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.799" end="00:55:57.440" style="s2">to pull the lever in their direction and</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.119" end="00:56:00.880" style="s2">the point is the purpose of that lever</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.440" end="00:56:03.040" style="s2">is about homeostasis right yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.880" end="00:56:04.319" style="s2">to the extent that the body becomes</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.040" end="00:56:07.520" style="s2">convinced</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.319" end="00:56:09.920" style="s2">that you know warmer is better</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.520" end="00:56:11.920" style="s2">it&#39;s on the verge of collapse right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.920" end="00:56:12.319" style="s2">no better to be convinced that colder is</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.920" end="00:56:14.160" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.319" end="00:56:15.359" style="s2">right the point is you want to maintain</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.160" end="00:56:18.079" style="s2">temperature in</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.359" end="00:56:19.040" style="s2">the functional range and the attack that</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.079" end="00:56:22.160" style="s2">you point to</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.040" end="00:56:23.440" style="s2">on the very ability to detect what is</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.160" end="00:56:26.720" style="s2">even true</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.440" end="00:56:27.440" style="s2">is evidence of a system that is in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.720" end="00:56:29.680" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.440" end="00:56:30.720" style="s2">of unhooking the very things on which</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.680" end="00:56:32.640" style="s2">homeostasis</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.720" end="00:56:33.760" style="s2">is based yeah and just to extend the</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.640" end="00:56:36.400" style="s2">metaphor i think</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.760" end="00:56:37.680" style="s2">um the people the people on the left who</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.400" end="00:56:39.920" style="s2">are protesting</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.680" end="00:56:41.119" style="s2">um let&#39;s let&#39;s just talk about the good</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.920" end="00:56:42.720" style="s2">faith protesters</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.119" end="00:56:44.400" style="s2">which i think includes a lot of confused</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.720" end="00:56:46.559" style="s2">people but the good faith people</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.400" end="00:56:47.920" style="s2">covered in cat for um the good faith</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.559" end="00:56:50.160" style="s2">people on the left who</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.920" end="00:56:52.079" style="s2">are demanding change now demanding</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.160" end="00:56:54.079" style="s2">change um</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.079" end="00:56:55.920" style="s2">due to what they see as a you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.079" end="00:56:58.000" style="s2">systemically racist society that</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.920" end="00:57:00.319" style="s2">by some estimations hasn&#39;t changed since</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.000" end="00:57:02.880" style="s2">selma alabama which is obviously wrong</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.319" end="00:57:04.000" style="s2">um but you know they they see something</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.880" end="00:57:05.839" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.000" end="00:57:07.359" style="s2">i and many others would argue and can</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.839" end="00:57:09.359" style="s2">compellingly argue from data isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.359" end="00:57:11.359" style="s2">true but they see that thing and say if</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.359" end="00:57:13.119" style="s2">this is true and we say it is true</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.359" end="00:57:15.040" style="s2">then we need change now because this is</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.119" end="00:57:16.720" style="s2">unconscionable and cannot stand</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.040" end="00:57:19.200" style="s2">and so they are effectively acting as</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.720" end="00:57:20.559" style="s2">the fever they are acting as the fever</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.200" end="00:57:21.440" style="s2">as the we&#39;re going to raise the</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.559" end="00:57:24.640" style="s2">temperature</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.440" end="00:57:26.400" style="s2">on the system so that we can free</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.640" end="00:57:29.920" style="s2">ourselves of this infection</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.400" end="00:57:31.920" style="s2">um that has been uh the case in western</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.920" end="00:57:34.240" style="s2">society from time and memorial</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.920" end="00:57:36.960" style="s2">and then we can go back but how dare you</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.240" end="00:57:41.040" style="s2">want homeostasis at a time like this</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.960" end="00:57:44.400" style="s2">and then there are others of us who say</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.040" end="00:57:48.319" style="s2">a lot of what you&#39;re saying is based on</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.400" end="00:57:50.640" style="s2">bad data and and and bad analysis</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.319" end="00:57:51.760" style="s2">that does not suggest that there is no</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.640" end="00:57:53.520" style="s2">is no racism</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.760" end="00:57:55.599" style="s2">and that there isn&#39;t a lot of correction</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.520" end="00:57:59.520" style="s2">to be done</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.599" end="00:58:01.680" style="s2">your framing of demographics of identity</p>

<p begin="00:58:02.880" end="00:58:05.920" style="s2">the thing that needs to be fixed right</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.480" end="00:58:08.240" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.920" end="00:58:08.960" style="s2">that&#39;s dangerous that is dangerous</p>

<p begin="00:58:08.960" end="00:58:12.559" style="s2">we were moving in the right direction we</p>

<p begin="00:58:55.839" end="00:59:00.799" style="s2">and to your point about um</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.359" end="00:59:02.000" style="s2">i don&#39;t like the term end of empire</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.799" end="00:59:02.559" style="s2">because i would like to think that as</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.000" end="00:59:04.960" style="s2">much as</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.559" end="00:59:06.960" style="s2">we have behaved in an imperial fashion</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.960" end="00:59:07.359" style="s2">at times that we aspire to something</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.960" end="00:59:09.440" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.359" end="00:59:11.520" style="s2">just better than empire yeah just as</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.440" end="00:59:13.359" style="s2">there is obviously a lot of racism</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.520" end="00:59:15.520" style="s2">in the history of the country including</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.359" end="00:59:16.799" style="s2">its founding um but we aspire to</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.520" end="00:59:20.079" style="s2">something better yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.799" end="00:59:21.680" style="s2">um but nonetheless the end of whatever</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.079" end="00:59:24.799" style="s2">it is the end of republic</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.680" end="00:59:25.920" style="s2">right that we may be seeing is i would</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.799" end="00:59:28.960" style="s2">argue the result</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.920" end="00:59:31.680" style="s2">of this process which</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.960" end="00:59:32.000" style="s2">you know at one point one of the uh</p>

<p begin="00:59:32.000" end="00:59:35.440" style="s2">i&#39;ve become friends with from my patreon</p>

<p begin="00:59:35.440" end="00:59:42.079" style="s2">posed the question uh is there an</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.480" end="00:59:43.119" style="s2">analogy um to senescence that is the</p>

<p begin="00:59:44.640" end="00:59:48.799" style="s2">happens to bodies is there an analogy</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.799" end="00:59:50.319" style="s2">for civilization and what i told him and</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.799" end="00:59:52.160" style="s2">i think i did a little video on it</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.319" end="00:59:54.160" style="s2">was that it was more than an analogy</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.160" end="00:59:58.400" style="s2">that there was in fact the exact</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.160" end="01:00:00.000" style="s2">same process and my argument was</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.400" end="01:00:01.599" style="s2">for reasons i won&#39;t go into here the</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.000" end="01:00:03.119" style="s2">reason that we grow feeble and</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.599" end="01:00:06.000" style="s2">inefficient with age</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.119" end="01:00:08.319" style="s2">is that we are complex creatures with a</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.000" end="01:00:10.319" style="s2">relatively small instruction set</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.319" end="01:00:11.920" style="s2">that means that instruction set contains</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.319" end="01:00:14.880" style="s2">instructions that do many things</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.920" end="01:00:15.920" style="s2">one instruction does many things and</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.880" end="01:00:17.839" style="s2">when that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.920" end="01:00:19.119" style="s2">there will be things that are good for</p>

<p begin="01:00:19.119" end="01:00:22.799" style="s2">and they&#39;re bad for you late in life and</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.119" end="01:00:23.839" style="s2">they will get collected by selection</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.799" end="01:00:26.720" style="s2">they will be favored</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.839" end="01:00:28.000" style="s2">because it&#39;s very likely that you will</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.720" end="01:00:30.000" style="s2">get the benefit of the early</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.000" end="01:00:31.440" style="s2">stuff and you won&#39;t live long enough to</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.000" end="01:00:32.960" style="s2">suffer from the late stuff and even if</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.440" end="01:00:34.960" style="s2">you do most of your reproduction will be</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.960" end="01:00:37.119" style="s2">done anyway so it counts less</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.960" end="01:00:38.640" style="s2">so selection is constantly accumulating</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.119" end="01:00:39.760" style="s2">things that are good for us early and</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.640" end="01:00:42.400" style="s2">bad for us late</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.760" end="01:00:44.319" style="s2">now here&#39;s the problem our political and</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.400" end="01:00:45.280" style="s2">economic system does the same goddamn</p>

<p begin="01:01:02.720" end="01:01:06.240" style="s2">so we couldn&#39;t grow them on before we</p>

<p begin="01:03:44.160" end="01:03:47.760" style="s2">we have to be able to say no yeah we</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.599" end="01:03:50.960" style="s2">have to be able to say no to you more so</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.760" end="01:03:52.880" style="s2">the more power you have and and and yet</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.960" end="01:03:54.240" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s also true that some things</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.880" end="01:03:57.039" style="s2">that you set in motion</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.240" end="01:03:57.599" style="s2">are incredibly difficult to unset in</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.039" end="01:04:00.240" style="s2">motion</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.599" end="01:04:02.079" style="s2">right and how you even do it i mean you</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.240" end="01:04:04.400" style="s2">know the social media one right</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.079" end="01:04:07.119" style="s2">at the point that somebody figures out</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.400" end="01:04:11.039" style="s2">how to connect a group of people who are</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.119" end="01:04:14.160" style="s2">interested in you know making</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.039" end="01:04:15.599" style="s2">models of famous battles right if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.160" end="01:04:16.960" style="s2">making miniature models of famous</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.599" end="01:04:18.720" style="s2">battles and you&#39;re gathering on the</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.960" end="01:04:20.880" style="s2">internet to talk to other people who are</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.720" end="01:04:22.480" style="s2">hundreds of thousands of miles from you</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.880" end="01:04:23.520" style="s2">right and somebody&#39;s looking at that</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.480" end="01:04:25.280" style="s2">thinking you know this</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.520" end="01:04:26.960" style="s2">this process that could get away from us</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.280" end="01:04:28.799" style="s2">it could derange us we could</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.960" end="01:04:30.559" style="s2">stop being able to think collectively</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.799" end="01:04:33.760" style="s2">about how to behave as a society</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.559" end="01:04:36.000" style="s2">that sounds nuts right but lo</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.760" end="01:04:37.359" style="s2">and behold you start dealing with you</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.000" end="01:04:39.280" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.359" end="01:04:40.640" style="s2">machine learning and search and feed</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.280" end="01:04:42.480" style="s2">algorithms and</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.640" end="01:04:44.240" style="s2">filter bubbles and all of this and next</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.480" end="01:04:46.000" style="s2">thing you know there&#39;s like an honest</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.240" end="01:04:47.039" style="s2">debate about whether two plus two</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.000" end="01:04:50.480" style="s2">actually equals</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.039" end="01:04:52.880" style="s2">four it&#39;s right well</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.480" end="01:04:54.400" style="s2">it&#39;s a debate but it&#39;s not honest let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.880" end="01:04:56.400" style="s2">put it this way</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.400" end="01:04:57.760" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s even worse yes whatever</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.400" end="01:04:59.520" style="s2">debate it is that can catch</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.760" end="01:05:01.359" style="s2">fire that has us debating this that has</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.520" end="01:05:02.880" style="s2">us you know uh</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.359" end="01:05:04.400" style="s2">looking at the question of whether or</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.880" end="01:05:06.160" style="s2">not to you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.400" end="01:05:08.079" style="s2">eliminate the police because maybe that</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.160" end="01:05:09.039" style="s2">would be better all of these things are</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.079" end="01:05:10.799" style="s2">nuts so my</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.039" end="01:05:13.119" style="s2">point would be the senescence of</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.799" end="01:05:14.559" style="s2">civilization would sound exactly like</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.119" end="01:05:15.920" style="s2">this basically here&#39;s the point</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.559" end="01:05:17.680" style="s2">what does senescence sound like in a</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.920" end="01:05:19.359" style="s2">person it very often sounds like</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.680" end="01:05:21.039" style="s2">dementia that&#39;s what happens when a</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.359" end="01:05:23.039" style="s2">brain is suffering all the downstream</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.039" end="01:05:26.240" style="s2">consequences of whatever made it</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.039" end="01:05:30.000" style="s2">vibrant as in youth right</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.240" end="01:05:31.839" style="s2">and this is like societal dementia</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.000" end="01:05:33.760" style="s2">and it has exactly the nature that</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.839" end="01:05:35.599" style="s2">you&#39;re pointing to you&#39;ve got two groups</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.760" end="01:05:37.359" style="s2">we agree on what the failure mode is</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.599" end="01:05:37.839" style="s2">right it&#39;s some kind of authoritarian</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.359" end="01:05:39.599" style="s2">evil</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.839" end="01:05:41.039" style="s2">that we don&#39;t want and both groups think</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.599" end="01:05:42.720" style="s2">the other one is going to bring it</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.039" end="01:05:44.400" style="s2">except that it&#39;s also true that some</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.720" end="01:05:46.319" style="s2">members of both groups</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.400" end="01:05:47.520" style="s2">only don&#39;t like authoritarian regimes</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.319" end="01:05:50.400" style="s2">when they&#39;re not in power</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.520" end="01:05:50.720" style="s2">right and they won&#39;t say that out loud</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.400" end="01:05:52.240" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.720" end="01:05:53.760" style="s2">but it&#39;s clearly true and this is</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.240" end="01:05:55.599" style="s2">something that we&#39;ve been saying since</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.760" end="01:05:58.000" style="s2">um since before evergreen went public</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.599" end="01:05:59.520" style="s2">but that the goal is not about</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.000" end="01:06:01.039" style="s2">reversing oppression it&#39;s about turning</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.520" end="01:06:03.760" style="s2">the tables of oppression</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.039" end="01:06:04.400" style="s2">and um you know that that is that is</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.760" end="01:06:06.160" style="s2">just true</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.400" end="01:06:07.520" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen that over and over and over</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.160" end="01:06:11.039" style="s2">again and</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.520" end="01:06:12.799" style="s2">um it has it has no place in this moment</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.039" end="01:06:13.359" style="s2">in history and yet it is claiming the</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.799" end="01:06:16.079" style="s2">throne</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.359" end="01:06:17.520" style="s2">at this moment in history well and you</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.079" end="01:06:18.079" style="s2">know i keep struggling for a better</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.520" end="01:06:21.359" style="s2">analogy</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.079" end="01:06:21.920" style="s2">than a ship but it is as if we are on a</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.359" end="01:06:24.079" style="s2">ship</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.920" end="01:06:25.760" style="s2">on which our very survival depends we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.079" end="01:06:28.799" style="s2">somehow in the middle of the pacific</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.760" end="01:06:29.359" style="s2">if the ship sinks there&#39;s no one to come</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.799" end="01:06:31.280" style="s2">get us</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.359" end="01:06:32.640" style="s2">it&#39;s just simply our ship you know two</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.280" end="01:06:35.119" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.640" end="01:06:36.880" style="s2">a nazi and a jew on the same ship in the</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.119" end="01:06:39.200" style="s2">middle of the pacific ought to agree</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.880" end="01:06:40.000" style="s2">that the ship is actually top priority</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.200" end="01:06:43.440" style="s2">right yeah</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.000" end="01:06:46.799" style="s2">because absent it they&#39;re both doomed so</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.440" end="01:06:48.720" style="s2">well so at at one level in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.799" end="01:06:50.160" style="s2">individuals making bad decisions right</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.720" end="01:06:53.599" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.160" end="01:06:54.559" style="s2">uh a lot of the people who are very very</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.599" end="01:06:57.920" style="s2">confused</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.559" end="01:06:59.680" style="s2">are millennials uh who were parented</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.920" end="01:07:01.760" style="s2">really badly not because their parents</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.680" end="01:07:03.200" style="s2">were mean or evil but because they</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.760" end="01:07:05.280" style="s2">accepted a stupid</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.200" end="01:07:06.240" style="s2">parenting ideology of snowplowing and</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.280" end="01:07:09.359" style="s2">parenting and</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.240" end="01:07:10.720" style="s2">helicoptering all risk and challenge</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.359" end="01:07:13.760" style="s2">away from their children</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.720" end="01:07:16.640" style="s2">at the same time that uh</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.760" end="01:07:18.160" style="s2">the elites in the west were grabbing</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.640" end="01:07:19.599" style="s2">more and more power for themselves so</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.160" end="01:07:22.240" style="s2">now we arrive at today</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.599" end="01:07:22.960" style="s2">with a group of up-and-coming you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.240" end="01:07:26.079" style="s2">adults</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.960" end="01:07:27.599" style="s2">up and coming adults and adults who have</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.079" end="01:07:29.119" style="s2">rarely experienced real risk and</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.599" end="01:07:29.920" style="s2">challenge in their lives because just</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.119" end="01:07:31.839" style="s2">within their</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.920" end="01:07:33.440" style="s2">tiny family structure they were</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.839" end="01:07:35.119" style="s2">protected from all of it if they were of</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.440" end="01:07:37.640" style="s2">a certain socioeconomic class as</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.119" end="01:07:38.799" style="s2">many of the activists were and</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.640" end="01:07:40.720" style="s2">simultaneously</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.799" end="01:07:43.200" style="s2">there is an abdication of responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.720" end="01:07:44.720" style="s2">for the common good at the higher levels</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.200" end="01:07:46.240" style="s2">and so we have these people on the</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.720" end="01:07:48.000" style="s2">streets now who</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.240" end="01:07:49.359" style="s2">are you know fighting fighting fighting</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.000" end="01:07:49.920" style="s2">you know fighting against the man or</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.359" end="01:07:53.599" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.920" end="01:07:55.599" style="s2">whatever they imagine it is um because</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.599" end="01:07:57.280" style="s2">someone has always been there to take</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.599" end="01:07:58.559" style="s2">care of their problems for them someone</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.280" end="01:08:00.960" style="s2">has always been there with the with the</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.559" end="01:08:03.920" style="s2">juice boxes to get back to that</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.960" end="01:08:04.400" style="s2">and in fact the real power has walked</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.920" end="01:08:07.039" style="s2">away</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.400" end="01:08:08.000" style="s2">with their goodies and has left a vacuum</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.039" end="01:08:11.359" style="s2">at the top</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.000" end="01:08:13.039" style="s2">and the parents who created them in part</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.359" end="01:08:15.280" style="s2">helped create the mess of a whole</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.039" end="01:08:16.640" style="s2">generation of kids who are now adults</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.280" end="01:08:18.080" style="s2">who don&#39;t know how to behave like adults</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.640" end="01:08:19.359" style="s2">because they never had challenger risk</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.080" end="01:08:21.839" style="s2">as children</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.359" end="01:08:23.839" style="s2">are breaking things in the streets</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.839" end="01:08:25.440" style="s2">because i imagine their senses that</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.839" end="01:08:26.799" style="s2">things always get put right</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.440" end="01:08:28.400" style="s2">there&#39;s no one around to put these</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.799" end="01:08:29.520" style="s2">things right they are breaking things</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.400" end="01:08:31.759" style="s2">that cannot be put right</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.520" end="01:08:32.560" style="s2">especially by their nimrod parents who</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.759" end="01:08:34.560" style="s2">protected them from</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.560" end="01:08:35.679" style="s2">all risk in the first place right you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.560" end="01:08:38.640" style="s2">attacking</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.679" end="01:08:39.120" style="s2">the ship or whatever analog for it there</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.640" end="01:08:42.400" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.120" end="01:08:43.839" style="s2">yeah and the point is look kids</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.400" end="01:08:45.359" style="s2">we may not be able to stop you from</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.839" end="01:08:46.560" style="s2">doing that but do you know what happens</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.359" end="01:08:48.880" style="s2">if you succeed</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.560" end="01:08:50.000" style="s2">right in attempting to stop you we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:09:08.880" end="01:09:13.520" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.679" end="01:09:16.319" style="s2">that we saw today this article</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.520" end="01:09:17.520" style="s2">emerges uh how a pledge to dismantle the</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.319" end="01:09:20.799" style="s2">minneapolis police</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.520" end="01:09:22.960" style="s2">collapsed and i i was thinking of</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.799" end="01:09:24.640" style="s2">reading a few paragraphs but i i won&#39;t i</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.960" end="01:09:27.120" style="s2">think the point here</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.640" end="01:09:28.159" style="s2">is that many people on the city council</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.120" end="01:09:30.880" style="s2">agreed</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.159" end="01:09:32.560" style="s2">to abolish the minneapolis police and</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.880" end="01:09:35.359" style="s2">they are now discovering</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.560" end="01:09:36.960" style="s2">that a nobody wants this or at least</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.359" end="01:09:39.440" style="s2">nobody smart does</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.960" end="01:09:40.239" style="s2">and b that it&#39;s an insane thing to even</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.440" end="01:09:42.640" style="s2">consider</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.239" end="01:09:44.480" style="s2">and so they&#39;re trying to i have not seen</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.640" end="01:09:46.319" style="s2">this article is the idea that it</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.480" end="01:09:48.000" style="s2">this policy was enacted a few months ago</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.319" end="01:09:50.080" style="s2">and it started to</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.000" end="01:09:51.359" style="s2">come into play and lo and behold it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.080" end="01:09:54.000" style="s2">not a good idea it was</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.359" end="01:09:54.640" style="s2">three three months ago and the fact is</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.000" end="01:09:57.760" style="s2">it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.640" end="01:09:59.360" style="s2">popular people you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.760" end="01:10:00.880" style="s2">black people prominent among them of</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.360" end="01:10:02.880" style="s2">course because</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.880" end="01:10:04.159" style="s2">they need the police as much as anybody</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.880" end="01:10:07.040" style="s2">don&#39;t like this and so</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.159" end="01:10:09.199" style="s2">what i&#39;ve come to see is that you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.040" end="01:10:10.159" style="s2">the people definitely want us to abolish</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.199" end="01:10:13.760" style="s2">the police</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.159" end="01:10:15.440" style="s2">the public does not right and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.760" end="01:10:17.360" style="s2">well what do you mean well the people is</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.440" end="01:10:20.719" style="s2">like this tiny little group of</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.360" end="01:10:23.040" style="s2">folks who are either confused</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.719" end="01:10:25.600" style="s2">or malevolent or a combination of the</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.040" end="01:10:27.840" style="s2">two they&#39;re out of control they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.600" end="01:10:29.280" style="s2">know how anything works yeah and so</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.840" end="01:10:30.320" style="s2">they&#39;re you know they&#39;re having a</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.280" end="01:10:34.000" style="s2">tantrum</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.320" end="01:10:36.480" style="s2">and it is um causing</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.000" end="01:10:37.920" style="s2">society to bend as if it is the public</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.480" end="01:10:39.199" style="s2">demanding these things which the public</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.920" end="01:10:41.840" style="s2">is not and so</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.199" end="01:10:43.040" style="s2">somehow uh the public needs to reassert</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.840" end="01:10:44.719" style="s2">itself because the people are gonna get</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.040" end="01:10:48.640" style="s2">us killed</p>

<p begin="01:11:31.840" end="01:11:36.640" style="s2">couple days ago</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.520" end="01:11:38.239" style="s2">and being interviewed on the culture</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.640" end="01:11:40.000" style="s2">wars jk rowling and living in</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.239" end="01:11:42.480" style="s2">anti-intellectual times</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.000" end="01:11:43.920" style="s2">so she published a book 30 years ago</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.480" end="01:11:46.159" style="s2">called gender trouble</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.920" end="01:11:48.320" style="s2">in which she introduces the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.159" end="01:11:50.560" style="s2">gender&#39;s performance</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.320" end="01:11:52.000" style="s2">and asks how we define quote the</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.560" end="01:11:53.440" style="s2">category of women</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.000" end="01:11:55.280" style="s2">okay so i&#39;m going to read a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.440" end="01:11:56.480" style="s2">from this but um zach give me my screen</p>

<p begin="01:11:56.480" end="01:12:00.080" style="s2">have some quotes she says i find it</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.040" end="01:12:01.840" style="s2">worrisome that suddenly the</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.080" end="01:12:03.280" style="s2">trans-exclusionary radical feminist</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.840" end="01:12:05.120" style="s2">position is understood as commonly</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.280" end="01:12:06.880" style="s2">accepted or even mainstream</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.120" end="01:12:08.080" style="s2">i think it is actually a fringe movement</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.880" end="01:12:08.960" style="s2">that is seeking to speak in the name of</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.080" end="01:12:10.800" style="s2">the mainstream and that our</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.960" end="01:12:13.120" style="s2">responsibility is to refuse to let that</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.800" end="01:12:13.120" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.800" end="01:12:18.480" style="s2">so the new statesman says one example of</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.120" end="01:12:19.760" style="s2">mainstream public discourse on this</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.480" end="01:12:21.280" style="s2">issue in the uk</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.760" end="01:12:22.800" style="s2">is the argument about allowing people to</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.280" end="01:12:24.800" style="s2">self-identify in terms of their gender</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.800" end="01:12:26.560" style="s2">in an open letter she published in june</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.800" end="01:12:28.239" style="s2">j.k rowling articulated the concern that</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.560" end="01:12:29.840" style="s2">this would quote throw open the doors of</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.239" end="01:12:31.440" style="s2">bathrooms and changing rooms to any man</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.840" end="01:12:33.120" style="s2">who believes or feels he&#39;s a woman</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.440" end="01:12:35.520" style="s2">potentially putting women at risk of</p>

<p begin="01:12:35.520" end="01:12:38.640" style="s2">if we look closely at the example that</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.120" end="01:12:40.880" style="s2">you characterize as mainstream we can</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.640" end="01:12:42.159" style="s2">see that a domain of fantasy is at work</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.880" end="01:12:43.840" style="s2">one which reflects more about the</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.159" end="01:12:45.760" style="s2">feminist who has such a fear than any</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.840" end="01:12:46.560" style="s2">actually existing situation in trans</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.760" end="01:12:48.000" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.560" end="01:12:49.600" style="s2">the feminist who holds such a view</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.000" end="01:12:50.320" style="s2">presumes that the penis does define the</p>

<p begin="01:12:50.320" end="01:12:53.440" style="s2">and that anyone with a penis would</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.760" end="01:12:55.040" style="s2">identify as a woman for the purposes of</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.440" end="01:12:57.520" style="s2">entering such changing rooms and posing</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.040" end="01:12:59.040" style="s2">a threat to the women inside</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.520" end="01:13:00.640" style="s2">it assumes that the penis is the threat</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.040" end="01:13:02.159" style="s2">or that any person who has a penis who</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.640" end="01:13:03.600" style="s2">identifies as a woman is engaging in a</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.159" end="01:13:04.480" style="s2">base deceitful and harmful form of</p>

<p begin="01:13:04.480" end="01:13:07.760" style="s2">this is a rich fantasy and one that</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.320" end="01:13:09.520" style="s2">comes from powerful fears but it does</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.760" end="01:13:10.800" style="s2">not describe a social reality</p>

<p begin="01:17:48.320" end="01:17:51.520" style="s2">was really excited about this book of</p>

<p begin="01:18:01.360" end="01:18:04.480" style="s2">and i was</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.239" end="01:18:05.520" style="s2">i it was probably foolish at one level</p>

<p begin="01:18:19.679" end="01:18:24.640" style="s2">uh and i definitely am a scientist but</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.880" end="01:18:27.280" style="s2">those are two different things</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.640" end="01:18:28.159" style="s2">and science cannot have an adjectival</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.280" end="01:18:30.320" style="s2">label attached</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.159" end="01:18:32.880" style="s2">attached to it and remain science it</p>

<p begin="01:19:47.280" end="01:19:50.080" style="s2">universe that seems probably big and</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.880" end="01:19:51.360" style="s2">fraught and anonymous</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.080" end="01:19:53.440" style="s2">and like it won&#39;t pay any attention to</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.360" end="01:19:56.080" style="s2">you but for god&#39;s sake figure out</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.440" end="01:19:57.600" style="s2">something interesting about yourself</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.080" end="01:19:59.520" style="s2">something interesting about yourself i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.600" end="01:20:00.400" style="s2">sure there&#39;s something that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.520" end="01:20:02.400" style="s2">involve</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.400" end="01:20:03.679" style="s2">don&#39;t use pronouns with me that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.400" end="01:20:05.679" style="s2">who i am</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.679" end="01:20:07.040" style="s2">no actually if you&#39;re going to speak</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.679" end="01:20:09.520" style="s2">english we&#39;re going to use pronouns</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.040" end="01:20:10.880" style="s2">i must say um i don&#39;t need to look at</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.520" end="01:20:12.320" style="s2">this person who doesn&#39;t use pronouns but</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.880" end="01:20:15.280" style="s2">i&#39;d like to talk to them i</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.320" end="01:20:16.480" style="s2">cannot overcome my curiosity as to what</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.280" end="01:20:18.800" style="s2">that would sound like</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.480" end="01:20:19.600" style="s2">no right i so i mean when we were next</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.800" end="01:20:20.960" style="s2">level for sure</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.600" end="01:20:22.560" style="s2">when we were at evergreen we had to</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.960" end="01:20:22.960" style="s2">write these narrative evaluations as you</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.560" end="01:20:24.320" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.960" end="01:20:25.679" style="s2">at the end so that didn&#39;t have grades</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.320" end="01:20:27.600" style="s2">and people will laugh at that but this</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.679" end="01:20:28.639" style="s2">was actually a very interesting and</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.600" end="01:20:30.880" style="s2">important part of</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.639" end="01:20:32.080" style="s2">of the experience for the students um</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.880" end="01:20:33.440" style="s2">and so we would write these narrative</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.080" end="01:20:35.920" style="s2">evaluations of them</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.440" end="01:20:37.679" style="s2">and our prone the pronouns that we used</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.920" end="01:20:39.360" style="s2">had to match the pronouns of the gender</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.679" end="01:20:41.760" style="s2">that they had on file</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.360" end="01:20:43.440" style="s2">and occasionally we had actually</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.760" end="01:20:46.320" style="s2">legitimately trans students</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.440" end="01:20:48.000" style="s2">yes uh who had not transitioned</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.320" end="01:20:50.639" style="s2">officially with the school yet</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.000" end="01:20:51.440" style="s2">and so we were in a position of saying</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.639" end="01:20:54.560" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.440" end="01:20:56.239" style="s2">look i i uh</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.560" end="01:20:57.679" style="s2">i either have to use the pronouns you</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.239" end="01:20:59.199" style="s2">have on file or</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.679" end="01:21:00.719" style="s2">every time i want to refer to you i have</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.199" end="01:21:01.920" style="s2">to use your name and that&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.719" end="01:21:02.880" style="s2">you know that&#39;s going to be very awkward</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.920" end="01:21:04.639" style="s2">but i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.880" end="01:21:06.560" style="s2">here here are the choices here are the</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.639" end="01:21:07.120" style="s2">choices i&#39;ve been given by the situation</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.560" end="01:21:08.880" style="s2">that by the</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.120" end="01:21:10.480" style="s2">combination of the college and what you</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.880" end="01:21:12.560" style="s2">are declaring yourself as and what you</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.480" end="01:21:15.199" style="s2">have done with the college at this point</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.560" end="01:21:17.360" style="s2">and um frankly those few cases where</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.199" end="01:21:19.920" style="s2">they said okay no pronouns use my name</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.360" end="01:21:21.199" style="s2">it it reads it reads super awkward yeah</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.920" end="01:21:24.239" style="s2">right um and you know</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.199" end="01:21:26.719" style="s2">do it be respectful of course but um</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.239" end="01:21:27.520" style="s2">but boy it makes communication difficult</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.719" end="01:21:30.000" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.520" end="01:21:31.920" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s almost as if language evolved</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.000" end="01:21:32.400" style="s2">for the purpose of communication rather</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.920" end="01:21:35.040" style="s2">than</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.400" end="01:21:35.920" style="s2">uh this look at me peacocking whatever</p>

<p begin="01:21:42.000" end="01:21:45.360" style="s2">has to be pee chickening because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.520" end="01:21:47.120" style="s2">the only gender-neutral term</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.360" end="01:21:48.560" style="s2">whoa i don&#39;t even know what that means</p>
