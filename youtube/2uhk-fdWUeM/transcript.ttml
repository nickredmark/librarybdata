<p begin="00:00:27.919" end="00:00:32.790" style="s2">so fitti you were just mentioning the</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.210" end="00:00:36.390" style="s2">link between Whitehead and epigenetics</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.790" end="00:00:38.070" style="s2">yes so in terms of evolution and a way</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.390" end="00:00:40.739" style="s2">of thinking about evolution in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.070" end="00:00:44.010" style="s2">you know T biology or whatever white had</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.739" end="00:00:46.710" style="s2">had more than actual influence on the</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.010" end="00:00:49.409" style="s2">evolution of science than people realize</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.710" end="00:00:51.600" style="s2">because epigenetics which used to be</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.409" end="00:00:54.750" style="s2">heresy in science it&#39;s the notion that</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.600" end="00:00:57.659" style="s2">the expression of genes is caused by the</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.750" end="00:00:59.070" style="s2">environment rather than former former</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.659" end="00:01:01.199" style="s2">genes so in other words the way you</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.070" end="00:01:02.670" style="s2">behave has an effect upon the expression</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.199" end="00:01:04.439" style="s2">of you at not only your genes but the</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.670" end="00:01:07.200" style="s2">genes of your offspring and even a</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.439" end="00:01:08.909" style="s2">generation fast forward yep</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.200" end="00:01:10.920" style="s2">so epigenetics some people say it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.909" end="00:01:13.380" style="s2">return to Lamarck you know Lamarque came</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.920" end="00:01:15.210" style="s2">up with theory evolution before darwin</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.380" end="00:01:17.220" style="s2">which said believed in them soft</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.210" end="00:01:19.799" style="s2">inheritance as it was known so if you</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.220" end="00:01:21.900" style="s2">acted in a certain way that behavior</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.799" end="00:01:24.240" style="s2">would somehow be taken after by your</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.900" end="00:01:26.009" style="s2">children and grandchildren people didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.240" end="00:01:28.560" style="s2">believe it but actually now with</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.009" end="00:01:30.600" style="s2">epigenetics in a way that&#39;s a form of</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.560" end="00:01:32.130" style="s2">Lamarckism because yeah the environment</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.600" end="00:01:32.870" style="s2">does affect the genes of one&#39;s offspring</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.130" end="00:01:35.310" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.870" end="00:01:37.170" style="s2">epigenetics now has been you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.310" end="00:01:39.630" style="s2">established scientific field for last 15</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.170" end="00:01:41.880" style="s2">years or so but it was created really by</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.630" end="00:01:43.770" style="s2">someone called CH Waddington the</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.880" end="00:01:46.680" style="s2">biologists geneticists an epigenetic</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.770" end="00:01:48.720" style="s2">cyst and he in his autobiography he</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.680" end="00:01:53.220" style="s2">explicitly said that he was a whitehead</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.720" end="00:01:55.380" style="s2">ian and he was kind of secretly bring</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.220" end="00:01:59.310" style="s2">Whitehead in metaphysics into his</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.380" end="00:02:01.110" style="s2">hypotheses and by doing that I mean</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.310" end="00:02:02.400" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a tract for example in</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.110" end="00:02:05.400" style="s2">modes of thought where Whitehead says</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.400" end="00:02:06.900" style="s2">you know our idea of the gene is an</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.400" end="00:02:08.789" style="s2">abstraction because it completely</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.900" end="00:02:11.370" style="s2">abstract from its environment what</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.789" end="00:02:13.110" style="s2">really goes gene is part and parcel of</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.370" end="00:02:15.030" style="s2">its environment its cell and self and</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.110" end="00:02:17.069" style="s2">the self the organ the organ the body</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.030" end="00:02:18.780" style="s2">the body the the actual environment</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.069" end="00:02:22.049" style="s2">around us all of this is part of one</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.780" end="00:02:24.209" style="s2">interacting process so to just delineate</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.049" end="00:02:26.489" style="s2">the gene it&#39;s like delineating the atom</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.209" end="00:02:28.379" style="s2">you know but rather as we know now the</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.489" end="00:02:29.970" style="s2">atom is part and parcel of its</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.379" end="00:02:31.890" style="s2">environment and it can be translated to</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.970" end="00:02:34.529" style="s2">energy but the same same as with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.890" end="00:02:37.150" style="s2">atom so with the gene and so even the</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.529" end="00:02:39.790" style="s2">1930s Whitehead was talking about how</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.150" end="00:02:40.840" style="s2">a form of sort of pure neo-darwinian</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.790" end="00:02:44.140" style="s2">etics</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.840" end="00:02:46.060" style="s2">can&#39;t be right and Waddington tested for</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.140" end="00:02:48.040" style="s2">this and as a result of that we have</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.060" end="00:02:50.950" style="s2">epigenetics today and of course</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.040" end="00:02:53.470" style="s2">epigenetics we know as part of must be</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.950" end="00:02:55.480" style="s2">crucial part of evolution because it is</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.470" end="00:02:57.579" style="s2">about the expression of genes that means</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.480" end="00:03:00.849" style="s2">that one&#39;s behavior influences evolution</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.579" end="00:03:02.470" style="s2">it&#39;s not all about mutation sexual</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.849" end="00:03:03.909" style="s2">selection natural selection right and</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.470" end="00:03:05.409" style="s2">even more than that something that</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.909" end="00:03:07.269" style="s2">Thomas Nagel philosopher Thomas Nagel</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.409" end="00:03:10.299" style="s2">spoken about recently it&#39;s this notion</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.269" end="00:03:12.700" style="s2">that if you reject epiphenomenalism the</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.299" end="00:03:14.260" style="s2">view that as we said mentality has no</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.700" end="00:03:16.420" style="s2">effect on the body or the environment</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.260" end="00:03:19.359" style="s2">and no effect upon later mentality</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.420" end="00:03:20.859" style="s2">either if you reject epiphenomenalism so</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.359" end="00:03:22.989" style="s2">in other words you believe that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.859" end="00:03:24.489" style="s2">mental has an effect upon the body as</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.989" end="00:03:25.540" style="s2">most people actually believe you know if</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.489" end="00:03:28.299" style="s2">you desire something it will actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.540" end="00:03:30.159" style="s2">cause your body to move and I think you</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.299" end="00:03:33.099" style="s2">have to accept mental causation</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.159" end="00:03:36.519" style="s2">otherwise for example reason has no</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.099" end="00:03:38.470" style="s2">purpose and as popper said if you well</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.519" end="00:03:40.810" style="s2">Papa said that epiphenomenalism was</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.470" end="00:03:42.699" style="s2">anti-darwinian or anti evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.810" end="00:03:44.799" style="s2">because we would not have evolved not</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.699" end="00:03:46.090" style="s2">only humans but all you know mammals and</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.799" end="00:03:47.709" style="s2">so on we would not have evolved</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.090" end="00:03:50.290" style="s2">mentality if it did absolutely nothing</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.709" end="00:03:52.209" style="s2">if it had no purpose for stijl organs</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.290" end="00:03:54.579" style="s2">they don&#39;t have perhaps Knab but they</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.209" end="00:03:56.290" style="s2">did have a purpose in the past but with</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.579" end="00:03:58.060" style="s2">epi flawless and mentality never had a</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.290" end="00:04:00.099" style="s2">purpose and doesn&#39;t have a purpose and</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.060" end="00:04:02.290" style="s2">unless it&#39;s sustained in this primary</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.099" end="00:04:05.019" style="s2">aspect of our reality of our lives yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.290" end="00:04:06.790" style="s2">so if you if you&#39;re an evolutionist you</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.019" end="00:04:08.530" style="s2">should leave mental causation now here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.790" end="00:04:10.150" style="s2">the interesting ramification of that</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.530" end="00:04:12.190" style="s2">that Nagel brings out what Papa didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.150" end="00:04:14.379" style="s2">if you believe in mental causation then</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.190" end="00:04:16.060" style="s2">you have to accept that mental causality</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.379" end="00:04:18.519" style="s2">in other words thinking must have had a</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.060" end="00:04:20.220" style="s2">profound effect upon evolution you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.519" end="00:04:24.159" style="s2">the physical evolution of bodies so</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.220" end="00:04:27.220" style="s2">through Whitehead and Magel and poplar</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.159" end="00:04:29.949" style="s2">and so on although I think evolution is</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.220" end="00:04:32.320" style="s2">of course true is a true process I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.949" end="00:04:33.820" style="s2">we only have again an abstraction of it</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.320" end="00:04:36.070" style="s2">I think we&#39;ll there&#39;s so much more to</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.820" end="00:04:37.810" style="s2">learn about it epigenetics is the first</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.070" end="00:04:40.360" style="s2">step in realizing that mental causation</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.810" end="00:04:42.820" style="s2">is a real force not necessarily the same</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.360" end="00:04:44.680" style="s2">thing as free will but our minds still</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.820" end="00:04:47.620" style="s2">have an effect upon physical reality</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.680" end="00:04:50.229" style="s2">right so you telling me Peter that these</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.620" end="00:04:50.980" style="s2">Facebook mean pages are actually deeply</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.229" end="00:04:54.760" style="s2">involved with</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.980" end="00:04:56.410" style="s2">future evolution of humanity everything</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.760" end="00:04:59.200" style="s2">plays its part oh yeah well I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.410" end="00:05:00.580" style="s2">thing I mean look this you know you</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.200" end="00:05:02.500" style="s2">might have even included in your summary</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.580" end="00:05:05.530" style="s2">of your viewing on your webpage but that</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.500" end="00:05:08.320" style="s2">this was a view that accords with a</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.530" end="00:05:11.230" style="s2">union understanding of archetypes right</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.320" end="00:05:14.290" style="s2">just in just in that well I mean if</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.230" end="00:05:16.300" style="s2">mentality is involved in directly and in</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.290" end="00:05:19.000" style="s2">affecting the course of evolution then</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.300" end="00:05:21.190" style="s2">therefore so or our metaphysics which</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.000" end="00:05:22.870" style="s2">you might take as on this kind of view</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.190" end="00:05:24.760" style="s2">where the action is considered the most</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.870" end="00:05:27.220" style="s2">real I mean metaphysics is ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.760" end="00:05:29.320" style="s2">about informing the deepest substrata of</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.220" end="00:05:31.270" style="s2">the cogs that turn will ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.320" end="00:05:33.580" style="s2">become our actions however you</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.270" end="00:05:34.810" style="s2">characterize how they filter up from</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.580" end="00:05:36.130" style="s2">that deep level perhaps through the</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.810" end="00:05:38.530" style="s2">unconscious and what have you and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.130" end="00:05:40.840" style="s2">interacting with that foundational</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.530" end="00:05:43.630" style="s2">source and interacting with whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.840" end="00:05:46.420" style="s2">process of engaging with being is that</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.630" end="00:05:49.240" style="s2">allows you to move between these realms</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.420" end="00:05:50.800" style="s2">so to speak yeah I think we&#39;re in other</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.240" end="00:05:52.300" style="s2">words we&#39;re uncovering other forms of</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.800" end="00:05:54.640" style="s2">causality other than the known full</p>

<p begin="00:06:00.640" end="00:06:04.570" style="s2">really yeah absolutely that&#39;s evolution</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.770" end="00:06:06.070" style="s2">itself yeah in fact if you don&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.570" end="00:06:07.360" style="s2">in mental causation you don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.070" end="00:06:09.660" style="s2">believe in psychology as a science</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.360" end="00:06:12.310" style="s2">because it&#39;s just be reducible to</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.660" end="00:06:14.140" style="s2">neurophysiology well absolutely i mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.310" end="00:06:16.180" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s isn&#39;t it isn&#39;t it so</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.140" end="00:06:17.920" style="s2">interesting i this is a slightly</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.180" end="00:06:19.570" style="s2">different question then it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.920" end="00:06:21.900" style="s2">if we just take our books on you an</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.570" end="00:06:24.820" style="s2">approach where we have on the one hand</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.900" end="00:06:27.010" style="s2">intellectualization roughly put in</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.820" end="00:06:28.660" style="s2">Russells terms the scientific impulse</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.010" end="00:06:30.910" style="s2">and on the other hand of bugs and we</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.660" end="00:06:32.440" style="s2">have intuition roughly put on the raw</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.910" end="00:06:35.530" style="s2">setting conception as the mystical</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.440" end="00:06:39.550" style="s2">impulse we have these two sides so to</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.530" end="00:06:42.190" style="s2">speak of man and well it seems that in</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.550" end="00:06:44.800" style="s2">different disciplines in different areas</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.190" end="00:06:46.660" style="s2">of life perhaps poetry as as versus</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.800" end="00:06:48.910" style="s2">analytic philosophy you have an</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.660" end="00:06:51.310" style="s2">identification with one rather than the</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.910" end="00:06:54.610" style="s2">other in some sense do you think that</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.310" end="00:06:56.230" style="s2">the the psychological disposition of an</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.610" end="00:06:58.360" style="s2">individual just that temperament</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.230" end="00:06:59.980" style="s2">essentially would influence the</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.360" end="00:07:01.570" style="s2">discipline they end up philosopher might</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.980" end="00:07:03.950" style="s2">end up pursuing and therefore an</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.570" end="00:07:06.830" style="s2">ultimately prejudicing</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.950" end="00:07:09.290" style="s2">his way of grounding himself in what he</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.830" end="00:07:09.800" style="s2">thought was real yeah I mean it brings</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.290" end="00:07:11.390" style="s2">to mind</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.800" end="00:07:12.770" style="s2">neech and beyond Knievel where his as a</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.390" end="00:07:14.180" style="s2">philosophers work is really just a</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.770" end="00:07:16.340" style="s2">reflection of this character right</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.180" end="00:07:17.870" style="s2">absolutely I believe that I mean if</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.340" end="00:07:19.640" style="s2">you&#39;re predisposed towards children</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.870" end="00:07:21.350" style="s2">you&#39;re much more likely to end up in</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.640" end="00:07:23.810" style="s2">child care than building right or</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.350" end="00:07:26.720" style="s2">philosophy or whatever of course you</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.810" end="00:07:28.850" style="s2">know your character which i think is</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.720" end="00:07:30.440" style="s2">sort of inborn mostly mostly when you</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.850" end="00:07:31.700" style="s2">look at children like twins brought up</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.440" end="00:07:33.260" style="s2">in the same household oh yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.700" end="00:07:35.780" style="s2">totally I mean there&#39;s a lot of evidence</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.260" end="00:07:37.190" style="s2">to show that character is innate to a</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.780" end="00:07:39.050" style="s2">certain extent but erm</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.190" end="00:07:40.550" style="s2">but of course you know vironment will</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.050" end="00:07:42.770" style="s2">affect that so you know you might have a</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.550" end="00:07:45.200" style="s2">bent towards science but if it&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.770" end="00:07:46.670" style="s2">offer in your country intent of course</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.200" end="00:07:49.240" style="s2">you won&#39;t do it and you&#39;ll perhaps be</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.670" end="00:07:51.500" style="s2">unhappy you know I think most people are</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.240" end="00:07:54.740" style="s2">not happy with that content with their</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.500" end="00:07:57.560" style="s2">vocations and that&#39;s brings a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.740" end="00:07:59.030" style="s2">misery to reality mm-hmm and I think in</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.560" end="00:08:03.560" style="s2">many cases people don&#39;t know what their</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.030" end="00:08:05.060" style="s2">vocation is so I&#39;m quite lucky to to</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.560" end="00:08:06.760" style="s2">know that philosophy sort of makes me</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.060" end="00:08:09.290" style="s2">happy I&#39;m also sort of you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.760" end="00:08:10.520" style="s2">artistically orientated to some extent I</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.290" end="00:08:13.010" style="s2">mean that doesn&#39;t surprise me</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.520" end="00:08:15.560" style="s2">so I I believe I am too although what I</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.010" end="00:08:17.840" style="s2">am aiming at and I think almost by a</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.560" end="00:08:19.940" style="s2">necessity if if you take yourself to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.840" end="00:08:22.370" style="s2">artistically inclined but end up doing</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.940" end="00:08:24.170" style="s2">philosophy what&#39;s what ends up happening</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.370" end="00:08:27.170" style="s2">is if you sort of have to build your own</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.170" end="00:08:29.630" style="s2">bridge to credibility fundamentally and</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.170" end="00:08:31.730" style="s2">given that the analytic philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.630" end="00:08:33.650" style="s2">institution let&#39;s just say it&#39;s built on</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.730" end="00:08:35.120" style="s2">the rational intellect yeah without the</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.650" end="00:08:36.800" style="s2">artistic element yeah I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.120" end="00:08:38.960" style="s2">interesting because in a way philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.800" end="00:08:41.030" style="s2">is the bridge between science and art</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.960" end="00:08:43.550" style="s2">isn&#39;t but analytic philosophy is much</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.030" end="00:08:45.650" style="s2">more on the scientific side exactly</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.550" end="00:08:48.890" style="s2">however to be a good analytic</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.650" end="00:08:51.500" style="s2">philosopher like jaegwan Kim one of my</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.890" end="00:08:53.960" style="s2">favorites philosopher mind one has to</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.500" end="00:08:57.230" style="s2">have style and one&#39;s writing and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.960" end="00:08:58.790" style="s2">not yeah there&#39;s a craft so the greatest</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.230" end="00:09:00.170" style="s2">analytic philosophers will still be</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.790" end="00:09:02.000" style="s2">artists in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.170" end="00:09:03.950" style="s2">Bertrand Russell even his early work was</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.000" end="00:09:05.750" style="s2">like that yeah Bertrand Russell won the</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.950" end="00:09:07.430" style="s2">greatest of all English writers I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.750" end="00:09:09.680" style="s2">so you can&#39;t really avoid it</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.430" end="00:09:11.510" style="s2">Whitehead said um style is the last</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.680" end="00:09:15.170" style="s2">night acquisition of the educated mind</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.510" end="00:09:16.640" style="s2">however I think yeah so the boring</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.170" end="00:09:17.480" style="s2">analytic philosophers are the ones who</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.640" end="00:09:20.690" style="s2">have got no artist</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.480" end="00:09:22.579" style="s2">dick talent but you can go too far the</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.690" end="00:09:24.920" style="s2">other direction as well and just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.579" end="00:09:26.839" style="s2">get where you&#39;ll end up in poetry and</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.920" end="00:09:27.980" style="s2">some people say that Nietzsche for</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.839" end="00:09:30.410" style="s2">example was only a poet an art</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.980" end="00:09:34.220" style="s2">philosopher the ideal really I think is</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.410" end="00:09:36.139" style="s2">shopping Hauer he&#39;s he&#39;s right he&#39;s he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.220" end="00:09:38.360" style="s2">you know the golden mean so he&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.139" end="00:09:41.779" style="s2">these great analytical moves great</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.360" end="00:09:44.510" style="s2">logical moves at the same time the turns</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.779" end="00:09:46.610" style="s2">of phrase are beautiful and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.510" end="00:09:50.480" style="s2">metaphors his great metaphors you know I</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.610" end="00:09:51.709" style="s2">remain are sublime so so that&#39;s thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.480" end="00:09:54.019" style="s2">that&#39;s the ultimate aim you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.709" end="00:09:54.829" style="s2">Schopenhauer and writer that&#39;s the ideal</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.019" end="00:09:59.480" style="s2">for the philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.829" end="00:10:02.029" style="s2">just between poetry and science right so</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.480" end="00:10:03.350" style="s2">I have one final thing especially</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.029" end="00:10:05.180" style="s2">because we don&#39;t have too much long</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.350" end="00:10:06.320" style="s2">longer together irrespective of this</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.180" end="00:10:09.769" style="s2">recording and I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.320" end="00:10:13.100" style="s2">include this one but part of the idea</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.769" end="00:10:14.449" style="s2">that I&#39;m using to try and tie together</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.100" end="00:10:15.560" style="s2">that broad the main of thought I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.449" end="00:10:17.870" style="s2">trying to bring together in my</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.560" end="00:10:20.690" style="s2">dissertation these conceptions of part</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.870" end="00:10:23.360" style="s2">making and whole making where part</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.690" end="00:10:25.580" style="s2">making here is broadly construed as</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.360" end="00:10:27.150" style="s2">something like</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.580" end="00:10:30.630" style="s2">the power</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.150" end="00:10:33.330" style="s2">mence instrumental utility associated</p>

<p begin="00:10:33.330" end="00:10:39.540" style="s2">it with analysis and empirically and</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.300" end="00:10:42.180" style="s2">what-have-you and on the other hand this</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.540" end="00:10:43.680" style="s2">whole making which to put it in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.180" end="00:10:46.910" style="s2">language of the conversation today would</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.680" end="00:10:50.400" style="s2">be a sort of identification with or</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.910" end="00:10:53.750" style="s2">Haigh sort of expressed it as as bearing</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.400" end="00:10:55.650" style="s2">an effective relation to this source of</p>

<p begin="00:10:55.650" end="00:11:03.840" style="s2">where I guess the value accessible when</p>

<p begin="00:11:28.880" end="00:11:33.720" style="s2">so in somehow it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.350" end="00:11:36.090" style="s2">outside of the established structure</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.720" end="00:11:38.280" style="s2">where part making ostensibly only works</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.090" end="00:11:39.930" style="s2">within and already imagined whole to</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.280" end="00:11:42.270" style="s2">sort of echo it out the whole making is</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.930" end="00:11:45.060" style="s2">what occurs when the explorer goes out</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.270" end="00:11:46.980" style="s2">into the unknown right and so I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.060" end="00:11:49.280" style="s2">to use this notions of part making and</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.980" end="00:11:51.450" style="s2">hole making to sort of tie together the</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.280" end="00:11:54.330" style="s2">utility of both worlds because I want to</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.450" end="00:11:57.510" style="s2">save the utility obviously of science</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.330" end="00:11:59.700" style="s2">and save how accurately it&#39;s able to</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.510" end="00:12:02.400" style="s2">come to describe reality at certain</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.700" end="00:12:03.780" style="s2">levels well I recommend the book where</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.400" end="00:12:06.120" style="s2">William James called a pluralistic</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.780" end="00:12:09.360" style="s2">universe but he talks about the values</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.120" end="00:12:10.950" style="s2">of both intellect and intuition and he</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.360" end="00:12:13.770" style="s2">uses three main thinkers in that book</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.950" end="00:12:18.060" style="s2">widget which are Hegel Fechner and James</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.770" end="00:12:21.600" style="s2">and he uses himself sorry Hegel feculent</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.060" end="00:12:25.080" style="s2">Berg&#39;s on me and end himself professor</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.600" end="00:12:28.620" style="s2">but he contrasts in like Burke Saunders</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.080" end="00:12:30.000" style="s2">intellect and intuition and how a full</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.620" end="00:12:31.860" style="s2">understanding reality requires this</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.000" end="00:12:35.700" style="s2">intuition along Burke&#39;s only Alliance</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.860" end="00:12:37.050" style="s2">but intellects yeah his cuts up reality</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.700" end="00:12:38.820" style="s2">in two parts so that we can deal with it</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.050" end="00:12:41.020" style="s2">you know so I mean language itself you</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.820" end="00:12:43.900" style="s2">know every word at least every</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.020" end="00:12:45.520" style="s2">we use is a cutting reality into that</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.900" end="00:12:47.590" style="s2">concepts you know whereas in reality of</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.520" end="00:12:49.210" style="s2">course far transcends that words you</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.590" end="00:12:51.310" style="s2">know like apple or tree or something</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.210" end="00:12:53.620" style="s2">like this and you know to talk about its</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.310" end="00:12:55.120" style="s2">entire evolution and its relation to</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.620" end="00:12:57.730" style="s2">everything else its gravity you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.120" end="00:12:59.860" style="s2">whatever so when we communicate we have</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.730" end="00:13:01.420" style="s2">to use abstractions but the danger is</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.860" end="00:13:03.340" style="s2">verification you know like thinking now</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.420" end="00:13:05.860" style="s2">the abstraction the concept is the</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.340" end="00:13:07.150" style="s2">sufficient totality and it&#39;s very you</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.860" end="00:13:09.250" style="s2">know Pete that&#39;s why people are prone to</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.150" end="00:13:10.780" style="s2">materialism generally because you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.250" end="00:13:13.540" style="s2">everything&#39;s cut up into little parts</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.780" end="00:13:15.520" style="s2">atomism and as ideal and we can express</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.540" end="00:13:17.320" style="s2">those ration ship between those parts</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.520" end="00:13:19.240" style="s2">are calling to these forces that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.320" end="00:13:21.010" style="s2">derived from observing regular</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.240" end="00:13:23.020" style="s2">occurrences and so on but it&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.010" end="00:13:26.290" style="s2">danger because yeah it&#39;s artificial</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.020" end="00:13:27.640" style="s2">cutouts and when you realize that then</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.290" end="00:13:29.350" style="s2">you enter metaphysics I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.640" end="00:13:30.790" style="s2">immediately but you know that&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.350" end="00:13:34.780" style="s2">whole book by them so it&#39;d be hard to</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.790" end="00:13:36.370" style="s2">say more Whitehead again bugs whiteheads</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.780" end="00:13:38.110" style="s2">great I mean he calls at the fallacy of</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.370" end="00:13:39.730" style="s2">misplaced concreteness very common and</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.110" end="00:13:41.830" style="s2">the fallacy of simple location for an</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.730" end="00:13:43.180" style="s2">atom or gene for example there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.830" end="00:13:44.620" style="s2">to look into there but yeah process</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.180" end="00:13:46.690" style="s2">philosophies is the complete antithesis</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.620" end="00:13:49.530" style="s2">of that compartmentalizing</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.690" end="00:13:52.600" style="s2">intellectuality here process philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.530" end="00:13:55.770" style="s2">may as well sign off again name is very</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.600" end="00:13:55.770" style="s2">much thank you Tim</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.460" end="00:14:04.850" style="s2">big thanks to PETA for joining me for</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.780" end="00:14:06.200" style="s2">these conversations I really look</p>

<p begin="00:14:06.200" end="00:14:09.320" style="s2">this year but at the end there we</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.910" end="00:14:11.840" style="s2">touched on the dynamic between the</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.320" end="00:14:13.880" style="s2">intellects and intuition in my work</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.840" end="00:14:16.490" style="s2">aligned with the notions of part making</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.880" end="00:14:19.490" style="s2">and home making which also seek to find</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.490" end="00:14:21.470" style="s2">the modes of analysis and mysticism into</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.490" end="00:14:24.560" style="s2">a sensical and mutually supportive</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.470" end="00:14:26.390" style="s2">knowledge seeking process I would say</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.560" end="00:14:28.930" style="s2">the characterization I gave of part</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.390" end="00:14:31.280" style="s2">Mason homemaking in this recording were</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.930" end="00:14:33.710" style="s2">definitely at an earlier stage of</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.280" end="00:14:36.110" style="s2">development and I definitely give a</p>
