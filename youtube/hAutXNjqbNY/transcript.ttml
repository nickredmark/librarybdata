<p begin="00:00:28.080" end="00:00:33.840" style="s2">46 it&#39;s 46. i&#39;m jumping the gun on 47.</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.199" end="00:00:35.280" style="s2">that explains why you have said nothing</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.840" end="00:00:36.960" style="s2">about this episode</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.280" end="00:00:38.800" style="s2">being a prime number because 46 of</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.960" end="00:00:42.160" style="s2">course is not a prime number</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.800" end="00:00:44.160" style="s2">it&#39;s not no but 47 is right</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.160" end="00:00:46.000" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s what i was thinking all</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.160" end="00:00:48.079" style="s2">right well now that we&#39;ve gotten that</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.000" end="00:00:49.120" style="s2">important piece of mathematical business</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.079" end="00:00:51.920" style="s2">out of the way</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.120" end="00:00:54.000" style="s2">it is time to get to the state of</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.920" end="00:00:54.559" style="s2">civilization which i have to tell you</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.000" end="00:00:57.360" style="s2">folks</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.559" end="00:00:59.280" style="s2">it&#39;s not good we&#39;ve got trouble i think</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.360" end="00:01:00.640" style="s2">first though we should note that um</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.280" end="00:01:03.680" style="s2">here in portland oregon we can breathe</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.640" end="00:01:05.439" style="s2">again uh it was it was a long time</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.680" end="00:01:06.880" style="s2">coming and for those of you who weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.439" end="00:01:08.640" style="s2">actually here in the pacific northwest</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.880" end="00:01:10.960" style="s2">you may have thought we were being</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.640" end="00:01:12.080" style="s2">engaging a little hyperbole it was bad</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.960" end="00:01:15.119" style="s2">but you know everyone&#39;s experienced</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.080" end="00:01:17.119" style="s2">bad error before but um it was</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.119" end="00:01:18.479" style="s2">really unprecedented in our experience</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.119" end="00:01:21.119" style="s2">and and we&#39;ve been in</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.479" end="00:01:22.080" style="s2">we&#39;ve been near fires before uh so you</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.119" end="00:01:24.560" style="s2">know we actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.080" end="00:01:27.200" style="s2">it maxed out the aqi scale we were above</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.560" end="00:01:29.200" style="s2">500 for a while and it barely dipped out</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.200" end="00:01:32.240" style="s2">of hazardous for almost 10 days</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.200" end="00:01:34.320" style="s2">and two nights ago a storm came through</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.240" end="00:01:35.520" style="s2">which before it started pouring involved</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.320" end="00:01:37.439" style="s2">lightning which of course is</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.520" end="00:01:39.119" style="s2">terrifying that more fires would be</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.439" end="00:01:41.040" style="s2">started but</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.119" end="00:01:42.560" style="s2">it rains sufficiently that we are now</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.040" end="00:01:45.840" style="s2">breathing easy</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.560" end="00:01:46.960" style="s2">for the first time in almost two weeks a</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.840" end="00:01:49.759" style="s2">week and a half</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.960" end="00:01:50.399" style="s2">uh and it feels terrific it does it</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.759" end="00:01:52.479" style="s2">feels</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.399" end="00:01:54.880" style="s2">spectacular and actually i can even see</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.479" end="00:01:55.360" style="s2">the sun shining out the window which is</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.880" end="00:01:57.119" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.360" end="00:01:58.399" style="s2">it&#39;s new we got little glimmers of it</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.119" end="00:02:00.560" style="s2">before but uh with the</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.399" end="00:02:02.399" style="s2">there&#39;s actual uh sun peeking through</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.560" end="00:02:02.799" style="s2">the trees actual shadows that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.399" end="00:02:04.640" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.799" end="00:02:06.560" style="s2">horrifying sort of apocalyptic yellow</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.640" end="00:02:07.200" style="s2">yeah the yellow is uh at least for the</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.560" end="00:02:09.599" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.200" end="00:02:10.879" style="s2">gone i will say i i was thinking back</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.599" end="00:02:11.680" style="s2">and i don&#39;t know for sure if this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.879" end="00:02:14.959" style="s2">right but</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.680" end="00:02:15.760" style="s2">i think that this smoke plus coveted</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.959" end="00:02:19.760" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.760" end="00:02:23.200" style="s2">caused me to spend um more time</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.760" end="00:02:26.239" style="s2">in our house not going anywhere than any</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.200" end="00:02:29.040" style="s2">other point in my</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.239" end="00:02:30.959" style="s2">life other than maybe if i was really</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.040" end="00:02:31.840" style="s2">sick at some point maybe i spent that</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.959" end="00:02:33.599" style="s2">much time</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.840" end="00:02:35.760" style="s2">not going anywhere but it was just</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.599" end="00:02:36.879" style="s2">really oppressive yeah and i think</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.760" end="00:02:38.400" style="s2">what you said to me was a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.879" end="00:02:39.680" style="s2">more clear than that i think because</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.400" end="00:02:40.959" style="s2">what you just said would suggest that</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.680" end="00:02:42.319" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about since march</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.959" end="00:02:44.640" style="s2">and obviously the lockdowns in march</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.319" end="00:02:47.680" style="s2">were tough um but</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.640" end="00:02:49.280" style="s2">really it was this 10 days of being</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.680" end="00:02:51.120" style="s2">locked in our home</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.280" end="00:02:52.560" style="s2">and what you had said to me was you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.120" end="00:02:54.239" style="s2">we couldn&#39;t even go outside</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.560" end="00:02:56.560" style="s2">and isn&#39;t is this maybe the longest</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.239" end="00:02:58.000" style="s2">period of time that either of us have</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.560" end="00:02:59.519" style="s2">practically never been outside you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.000" end="00:03:01.040" style="s2">we went to the mailbox i tried to take</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.519" end="00:03:03.200" style="s2">the dog on a couple of walks you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.040" end="00:03:06.080" style="s2">fully massed up but it was</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.200" end="00:03:06.480" style="s2">horrifying and oppressive so this really</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.080" end="00:03:09.040" style="s2">did</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.480" end="00:03:11.599" style="s2">lock us down in a way that i think gave</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.040" end="00:03:13.519" style="s2">me at least a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.599" end="00:03:15.200" style="s2">empathy we talked about during the early</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.519" end="00:03:16.720" style="s2">covet lockdowns of how hard this would</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.200" end="00:03:18.319" style="s2">be for people living</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.720" end="00:03:20.720" style="s2">in cramped apartment quarters for</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.319" end="00:03:23.120" style="s2">instance with no real</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.720" end="00:03:24.400" style="s2">um outside to go to but you know even</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.120" end="00:03:26.319" style="s2">even then</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.400" end="00:03:27.440" style="s2">there is presumably usually some place</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.319" end="00:03:29.120" style="s2">you can go even if it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.440" end="00:03:30.480" style="s2">even if it&#39;s not nature you know even if</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.120" end="00:03:32.080" style="s2">it&#39;s just an urban scape</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.480" end="00:03:35.040" style="s2">and uh there was really nothing to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.080" end="00:03:37.120" style="s2">done here yeah now that that is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.040" end="00:03:38.799" style="s2">what i mean so it&#39;s like the combination</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.120" end="00:03:40.799" style="s2">of you couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.799" end="00:03:42.400" style="s2">go somewhere there was no indoor space</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.799" end="00:03:43.120" style="s2">that was being filtered to go to yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.400" end="00:03:46.319" style="s2">could go to a movie</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.120" end="00:03:48.319" style="s2">because of covid right and um you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.319" end="00:03:49.519" style="s2">we&#39;ve been talking a lot about covet and</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.319" end="00:03:51.040" style="s2">the fact that the loophole</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.519" end="00:03:52.799" style="s2">in the logic of covid is that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.040" end="00:03:54.159" style="s2">outdoors are safe and so you should</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.799" end="00:03:55.200" style="s2">drink it in and then this suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.159" end="00:03:57.840" style="s2">descended on us</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.200" end="00:03:59.599" style="s2">um so actually in our in our household</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.840" end="00:04:00.560" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to reconstruct exactly when</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.599" end="00:04:04.000" style="s2">this had happened and</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.560" end="00:04:06.400" style="s2">i had gone out on a bike ride and</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.000" end="00:04:07.920" style="s2">i hit a bridge over the willamette and i</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.400" end="00:04:11.360" style="s2">could see this very</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.920" end="00:04:13.040" style="s2">unnatural cloud and it was</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.360" end="00:04:14.480" style="s2">perceptibly moving our direction so i</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.040" end="00:04:16.000" style="s2">contacted you and said you know probably</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.480" end="00:04:17.680" style="s2">ought to close the windows because</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.000" end="00:04:19.519" style="s2">it looks like smoke is coming but i had</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.680" end="00:04:20.239" style="s2">no idea that we were really talking</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.519" end="00:04:22.800" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.239" end="00:04:25.360" style="s2">more than a week that was 12 days ago</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.800" end="00:04:27.840" style="s2">yeah 12 days ago</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.360" end="00:04:28.560" style="s2">and so anyway the degree to which it has</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.840" end="00:04:31.280" style="s2">affected</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.560" end="00:04:32.960" style="s2">the ability to think and you know i i</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.280" end="00:04:34.320" style="s2">you and i have talked about whether the</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.960" end="00:04:36.080" style="s2">smoke itself</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.320" end="00:04:37.919" style="s2">was having some impact or whether that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.080" end="00:04:38.880" style="s2">just simply you know time seemed to</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.919" end="00:04:41.600" style="s2">grind to a</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.880" end="00:04:42.960" style="s2">halt where it had been operating very</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.600" end="00:04:45.360" style="s2">bizarrely since kovid</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.960" end="00:04:47.120" style="s2">you know where months pass and um you</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.360" end="00:04:48.720" style="s2">don&#39;t realize where they&#39;ve gone</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.120" end="00:04:51.199" style="s2">in this case it just seemed like it</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.720" end="00:04:53.040" style="s2">stopped yeah no but i i do think</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.199" end="00:04:54.479" style="s2">i&#39;ve said something about smoke toxicity</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.040" end="00:04:56.880" style="s2">on the last show not</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.479" end="00:04:57.680" style="s2">we know with no specificity implied i</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.880" end="00:05:00.400" style="s2">don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.680" end="00:05:02.160" style="s2">what um what the particulate matter or</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.400" end="00:05:03.440" style="s2">other things in the smoke might actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.160" end="00:05:06.320" style="s2">be doing but</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.440" end="00:05:07.520" style="s2">um you know in addition the new and</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.320" end="00:05:09.440" style="s2">extreme technical</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.520" end="00:05:11.039" style="s2">troubles that we were having with the</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.440" end="00:05:12.479" style="s2">podcast with the live stream</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.039" end="00:05:14.560" style="s2">have since we were able to open up the</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.479" end="00:05:17.520" style="s2">windows yesterday and get air flow</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.560" end="00:05:18.080" style="s2">um largely disappeared right which</p>

<p begin="00:05:20.880" end="00:05:23.919" style="s2">that interested in the tech</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.080" end="00:05:25.520" style="s2">underlying this but i do think what we</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.919" end="00:05:27.360" style="s2">have been facing on this front</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.520" end="00:05:30.320" style="s2">raises very interesting questions</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.360" end="00:05:34.400" style="s2">because we did have this amazing set of</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.320" end="00:05:37.360" style="s2">failures and after what must have been</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.400" end="00:05:38.479" style="s2">25 hours of my time in addition to all</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.360" end="00:05:39.919" style="s2">of the time that zach spent</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.479" end="00:05:40.880" style="s2">troubleshooting we did narrow it down</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.919" end="00:05:43.919" style="s2">quite a bit</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.880" end="00:05:46.080" style="s2">and it turns out we were right it was</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.919" end="00:05:48.000" style="s2">interference now where the interference</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.080" end="00:05:50.240" style="s2">comes from we don&#39;t know but the</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.000" end="00:05:52.960" style="s2">interesting thing is it seems to affect</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.240" end="00:05:54.720" style="s2">not every single device in the house</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.960" end="00:05:58.960" style="s2">that uses hdmi</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.720" end="00:06:00.880" style="s2">but only devices that use hdmi including</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.960" end="00:06:02.160" style="s2">our television which uses a little</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.880" end="00:06:05.440" style="s2">chromecast</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.160" end="00:06:08.720" style="s2">uh device to allow us to get</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.440" end="00:06:11.680" style="s2">hbo without subscribing to cable so</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.720" end="00:06:12.880" style="s2">something about hd hdmi has left us</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.680" end="00:06:15.360" style="s2">vulnerable so</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.880" end="00:06:17.120" style="s2">if you are if you are not seeing</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.360" end="00:06:20.160" style="s2">glitches right now</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.120" end="00:06:21.840" style="s2">um we are actually utilizing hdmi</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.160" end="00:06:23.600" style="s2">as heather points out with the windows</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.840" end="00:06:26.479" style="s2">open after</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.600" end="00:06:28.479" style="s2">uh more than 12 days things seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.479" end="00:06:30.400" style="s2">better which raises the spectre</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.479" end="00:06:32.160" style="s2">of the possibility that something like</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.400" end="00:06:33.680" style="s2">radon which has been captured in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.160" end="00:06:34.880" style="s2">house which ordinarily would be vented</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.680" end="00:06:37.280" style="s2">at some rate</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.880" end="00:06:38.479" style="s2">um might be emitting something which</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.280" end="00:06:40.000" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be collected wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.479" end="00:06:41.840" style="s2">captured by the hepa filters the all</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.000" end="00:06:43.600" style="s2">house filters that are otherwise taken</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.840" end="00:06:44.479" style="s2">care of um whatever particulate stuff</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.600" end="00:06:47.600" style="s2">might be coming in</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.479" end="00:06:49.520" style="s2">exactly it&#39;s not particulate and so um</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.600" end="00:06:51.039" style="s2">anyway we&#39;re testing that possibility it</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.520" end="00:06:52.639" style="s2">takes a little time to get a long enough</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.039" end="00:06:55.440" style="s2">test to know but</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.639" end="00:06:57.520" style="s2">um the degree to which even our house</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.440" end="00:07:00.240" style="s2">was a little bit freaked out by</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.520" end="00:07:00.800" style="s2">the degree of lockdown was interesting</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.240" end="00:07:03.440" style="s2">yep</p>

<p begin="00:13:58.079" end="00:14:02.240" style="s2">both from ginsburg and from scalia that</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.480" end="00:14:03.440" style="s2">is cogent and coherent and causes us to</p>

<p begin="00:14:03.440" end="00:14:07.279" style="s2">than we might have before about what is</p>

<p begin="00:15:58.320" end="00:16:03.680" style="s2">um zach do you have it you&#39;re working on</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.600" end="00:16:03.680" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.079" end="00:16:08.720" style="s2">okay well in any case the thing i want</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.639" end="00:16:13.839" style="s2">to point out about it is</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.720" end="00:16:17.120" style="s2">that the decency of justice ginsburg</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.839" end="00:16:18.560" style="s2">results in you know you watch trump</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.120" end="00:16:20.480" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.560" end="00:16:22.079" style="s2">literally take a moment i think to</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.480" end="00:16:23.600" style="s2">consider the political implications</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.079" end="00:16:25.360" style="s2">of what he&#39;s about to say which would be</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.600" end="00:16:27.680" style="s2">true to character for him and</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.360" end="00:16:28.639" style="s2">it would and of any political leader at</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.680" end="00:16:30.720" style="s2">some level</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.639" end="00:16:32.320" style="s2">well it&#39;s possible that you would have</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.720" end="00:16:34.480" style="s2">um a sense</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.320" end="00:16:36.160" style="s2">a human response that just overrode that</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.480" end="00:16:37.680" style="s2">you would just know was okay</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.160" end="00:16:39.600" style="s2">and so you wouldn&#39;t have to go through</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.680" end="00:16:41.519" style="s2">that that uh checksum</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.600" end="00:16:42.800" style="s2">but um but nonetheless i think he does</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.519" end="00:16:45.040" style="s2">check and it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.800" end="00:16:47.120" style="s2">i think uh virtually any modern</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.040" end="00:16:50.320" style="s2">politician probably would</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.120" end="00:16:51.680" style="s2">check and um and then anyway he says</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.320" end="00:16:54.639" style="s2">some things about her</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.680" end="00:16:56.160" style="s2">uh including you know that you</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.639" end="00:16:56.880" style="s2">essentially you have to admire her</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.160" end="00:16:58.560" style="s2">whether you</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.880" end="00:17:00.800" style="s2">disagree with her or agree with her you</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.560" end="00:17:01.440" style="s2">have to admire what she accomplished and</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.800" end="00:17:04.559" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.440" end="00:17:07.760" style="s2">again in a very divisive president</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.559" end="00:17:08.319" style="s2">uh her her death brings out this this</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.760" end="00:17:11.199" style="s2">spirit</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.319" end="00:17:12.559" style="s2">of reaching across the the aisle or the</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.199" end="00:17:14.400" style="s2">political spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.559" end="00:17:16.079" style="s2">and being decent to each other and being</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.400" end="00:17:18.000" style="s2">decent to each other and she really</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.079" end="00:17:19.760" style="s2">you know in going back through last</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.000" end="00:17:22.799" style="s2">night and today just a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.760" end="00:17:24.559" style="s2">her history i was reminded that</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.799" end="00:17:26.319" style="s2">a lot of her early the early cases that</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.559" end="00:17:26.880" style="s2">she brought were specifically pointing</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.319" end="00:17:30.160" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.880" end="00:17:32.000" style="s2">um places in the law where men and women</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.160" end="00:17:34.400" style="s2">were treated differently</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.000" end="00:17:36.000" style="s2">and men appeared to suffer as a result</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.400" end="00:17:37.760" style="s2">so this is the way that she got in you</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.000" end="00:17:40.400" style="s2">know this is this is the way</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.760" end="00:17:41.679" style="s2">um that she ended up sort of being able</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.400" end="00:17:44.480" style="s2">to bring the cases</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.679" end="00:17:46.240" style="s2">before a you know mostly male uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.480" end="00:17:48.240" style="s2">judiciary at that point and to get the</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.240" end="00:17:50.320" style="s2">attention of mostly men</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.240" end="00:17:51.840" style="s2">uh to point out that actually the you</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.320" end="00:17:52.559" style="s2">know these arguments can sound very</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.840" end="00:17:54.080" style="s2">lovely</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.559" end="00:17:55.919" style="s2">um but they will end up being</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.080" end="00:17:59.120" style="s2">discriminatory in ways that you</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.919" end="00:18:02.320" style="s2">may never have imagined yes</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.120" end="00:18:05.679" style="s2">um and the uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.320" end="00:18:08.960" style="s2">the fact that such an amazing person</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.679" end="00:18:12.559" style="s2">and force that her death at this moment</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.960" end="00:18:16.240" style="s2">is going to cause and is already causing</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.559" end="00:18:19.840" style="s2">um a catastrophe in the context of this</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.240" end="00:18:22.720" style="s2">election is you know it&#39;s really it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.840" end="00:18:23.039" style="s2">it&#39;s a tragedy for democracy because it</p>

<p begin="00:18:23.039" end="00:18:27.919" style="s2">um the the fact this has</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.080" end="00:18:29.840" style="s2">implications for this election that are</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.919" end="00:18:33.039" style="s2">truly profound</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.840" end="00:18:36.559" style="s2">and you know apparently justice ginsburg</p>

<p begin="00:18:36.559" end="00:18:41.520" style="s2">hoped to survive through the</p>

<p begin="00:18:41.520" end="00:18:43.919" style="s2">that she would be replaced by someone</p>

<p begin="00:18:43.919" end="00:18:47.360" style="s2">it&#39;s no surprise that she would she</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.360" end="00:18:49.360" style="s2">would have thought that this has to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.360" end="00:18:50.559" style="s2">in the style of thinking of every</p>

<p begin="00:18:53.840" end="00:19:01.440" style="s2">um on the other hand um</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.240" end="00:19:03.200" style="s2">the fact of her death at this moment</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.440" end="00:19:04.960" style="s2">and the fact of the implications for the</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.200" end="00:19:08.080" style="s2">election is</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.960" end="00:19:10.000" style="s2">like a gargantuan magnetic force for</p>

<p begin="00:19:10.000" end="00:19:14.000" style="s2">and frankly i will say i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.480" end="00:19:17.039" style="s2">going to play right into the hands</p>

<p begin="00:22:04.880" end="00:22:08.159" style="s2">and so what i would say is yeah sure he</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.600" end="00:22:10.880" style="s2">frankly</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.159" end="00:22:12.240" style="s2">he&#39;s too damn old and he would be tired</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.880" end="00:22:13.760" style="s2">even if he was showing you know even if</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.240" end="00:22:15.039" style="s2">he was bernie sanders and showing no</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.760" end="00:22:16.559" style="s2">signs of decline</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.039" end="00:22:18.080" style="s2">cognitive decline right the point is</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.559" end="00:22:19.039" style="s2">we&#39;d still have to say does it make</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.080" end="00:22:20.480" style="s2">sense to</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.039" end="00:22:22.880" style="s2">put somebody in such an important</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.480" end="00:22:25.679" style="s2">position that is so grueling</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.880" end="00:22:26.799" style="s2">right and in this case you know well</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.679" end="00:22:29.440" style="s2">like i said i think</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.799" end="00:22:31.679" style="s2">he did a fine job of what he said but</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.440" end="00:22:34.000" style="s2">the fact that it does feel tenuous</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.679" end="00:22:35.679" style="s2">i think is there&#39;s a legitimate reason</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.000" end="00:22:38.159" style="s2">for concern there which is that somebody</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.679" end="00:22:41.360" style="s2">this old is simply</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.159" end="00:22:43.840" style="s2">prone to be unable to deal with uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.360" end="00:22:44.400" style="s2">crisis aren&#39;t they the same age issue</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.840" end="00:22:46.880" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.400" end="00:22:47.840" style="s2">i agree i think uh trump is showing</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.880" end="00:22:51.039" style="s2">signs and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.840" end="00:22:51.840" style="s2">worried there too but i would say he is</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.039" end="00:22:54.080" style="s2">showing</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.840" end="00:22:55.520" style="s2">fewer of those signs but basically i</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.080" end="00:22:59.919" style="s2">think we are learning</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.520" end="00:22:59.919" style="s2">what i have come to realize is that</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.000" end="00:23:03.039" style="s2">the number of people that i would</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.000" end="00:23:05.520" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.039" end="00:23:06.880" style="s2">trust in this role who are not eligible</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.520" end="00:23:09.360" style="s2">by virtue of being too</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.880" end="00:23:10.480" style="s2">young is not huge but it there are</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.360" end="00:23:13.360" style="s2">several people</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.480" end="00:23:15.039" style="s2">on that list who i think would be um</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.360" end="00:23:15.440" style="s2">decent candidates for president who</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.039" end="00:23:18.640" style="s2">don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.440" end="00:23:20.000" style="s2">really yeah do you want to share any i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.640" end="00:23:21.200" style="s2">like us to talk a bit more about</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.000" end="00:23:23.200" style="s2">ginsburg but um</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.200" end="00:23:24.240" style="s2">this is this is a little surprising to</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.200" end="00:23:26.080" style="s2">me who who</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.240" end="00:23:29.679" style="s2">below the age of 35 you&#39;re just talking</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.080" end="00:23:34.720" style="s2">about the age limit right like right now</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.679" end="00:23:36.880" style="s2">in my own defense i would say that um</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.720" end="00:23:38.799" style="s2">it&#39;s not that i would i do think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.880" end="00:23:40.080" style="s2">a reason to want somebody with more</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.799" end="00:23:43.200" style="s2">experience but</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.080" end="00:23:44.880" style="s2">my point here is simply that there are</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.200" end="00:23:48.559" style="s2">people below this age</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.880" end="00:23:51.520" style="s2">who um appear to have sufficient wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.559" end="00:23:52.400" style="s2">to beat the candidates that we actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.520" end="00:23:55.279" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.400" end="00:23:57.440" style="s2">by you know by a wide margin even though</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.279" end="00:23:57.919" style="s2">i mean if anything 35 is younger than it</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.440" end="00:24:00.320" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.919" end="00:24:01.039" style="s2">when that um that requirement was put</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.320" end="00:24:03.440" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.039" end="00:24:05.120" style="s2">into law right you know because because</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.440" end="00:24:07.760" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.120" end="00:24:08.640" style="s2">life expectancy is longer and we have</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.760" end="00:24:11.120" style="s2">greater health</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.640" end="00:24:12.799" style="s2">in our youth and middle age now so um</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.120" end="00:24:13.600" style="s2">and you know we&#39;ve had these extended</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.799" end="00:24:15.200" style="s2">childhoods</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.600" end="00:24:17.520" style="s2">where you know people are not forced to</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.200" end="00:24:20.720" style="s2">become adults for a lot longer than</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.520" end="00:24:23.760" style="s2">was the case uh back in the 18th century</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.720" end="00:24:26.159" style="s2">yeah so um</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.760" end="00:24:27.840" style="s2">you know i&#39;m debating in my own mind</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.159" end="00:24:30.320" style="s2">whether it makes sense to actually say</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.840" end="00:24:31.200" style="s2">names out loud but i would just say you</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.320" end="00:24:32.640" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.200" end="00:24:33.919" style="s2">it&#39;s not that i think anybody that age</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.640" end="00:24:35.279" style="s2">knows enough but i do think there are</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.919" end="00:24:36.799" style="s2">people that age who know</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.279" end="00:24:38.799" style="s2">that they don&#39;t know enough and would</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.799" end="00:24:39.919" style="s2">know how to process information they</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.799" end="00:24:41.919" style="s2">would source</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.919" end="00:24:43.200" style="s2">information well and and they would do a</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.919" end="00:24:46.240" style="s2">good job so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.200" end="00:24:46.559" style="s2">the overarching point is they should</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.240" end="00:24:48.960" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.559" end="00:24:49.919" style="s2">the founders should have given us a</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.960" end="00:24:52.000" style="s2">maximum age</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.919" end="00:24:53.919" style="s2">probably the maximum age would be too</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.000" end="00:24:54.799" style="s2">low in light of the fact that people</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.919" end="00:24:58.000" style="s2">remain younger</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.799" end="00:24:59.279" style="s2">longer than they once did um but um</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.000" end="00:25:01.520" style="s2">but it is interesting yeah they would</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.279" end="00:25:03.840" style="s2">the maximum age that you might choose</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.520" end="00:25:05.360" style="s2">would likely have been beyond life</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.840" end="00:25:06.240" style="s2">expectancy and so wouldn&#39;t have made</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.360" end="00:25:09.440" style="s2">sense to do</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.240" end="00:25:12.559" style="s2">right right right exactly um so</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.440" end="00:25:12.559" style="s2">anyway uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.799" end="00:25:16.080" style="s2">but i i think that&#39;s where we should</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.039" end="00:25:17.919" style="s2">leave it okay um</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.080" end="00:25:19.200" style="s2">and if we if there is a clamor maybe</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.919" end="00:25:21.520" style="s2">i&#39;ll come back and talk about who</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.200" end="00:25:22.559" style="s2">who that is young actually fits the bill</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.520" end="00:25:25.840" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.559" end="00:25:28.960" style="s2">um so you know ginsburg</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.840" end="00:25:32.000" style="s2">really did</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.960" end="00:25:34.080" style="s2">change the the judicial landscape</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.000" end="00:25:35.120" style="s2">um the legal landscape for women in</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.080" end="00:25:38.159" style="s2">tremendous ways</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.120" end="00:25:40.559" style="s2">and um that was true before</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.159" end="00:25:41.200" style="s2">you know notorious rgb and you know all</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.559" end="00:25:44.480" style="s2">of this</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.200" end="00:25:45.120" style="s2">strange adulation late in her life that</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.480" end="00:25:48.880" style="s2">became</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.120" end="00:25:52.159" style="s2">uh sort of i don&#39;t know in in meme space</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.880" end="00:25:52.559" style="s2">uh she she really was out there saying</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.159" end="00:25:54.159" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.559" end="00:25:56.080" style="s2">part of the reason i read specifically</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.159" end="00:25:59.440" style="s2">the quotes that i did is her</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.080" end="00:26:00.799" style="s2">her recognition of without specifying</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.440" end="00:26:03.760" style="s2">what they might be</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.799" end="00:26:05.840" style="s2">of population level differences between</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.760" end="00:26:08.320" style="s2">men and women</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.840" end="00:26:10.880" style="s2">and her recognition that under the law</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.320" end="00:26:14.320" style="s2">we must be treated equally because</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.880" end="00:26:16.559" style="s2">for any for any overlapping</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.320" end="00:26:17.679" style="s2">to normal distributions for any trait</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.559" end="00:26:21.440" style="s2">they will be</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.679" end="00:26:24.880" style="s2">um you know extraordinary men and</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.440" end="00:26:27.360" style="s2">what&#39;s the opposite of extraordinary um</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.880" end="00:26:28.480" style="s2">lackluster no lackluster is not the</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.360" end="00:26:30.640" style="s2">opposite of extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.480" end="00:26:32.080" style="s2">um you know incompetent men and there</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.640" end="00:26:33.360" style="s2">will be extraordinary women and</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.080" end="00:26:35.600" style="s2">incompetent women</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.360" end="00:26:37.360" style="s2">and the idea that um you know in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.600" end="00:26:38.000" style="s2">case of a vmi and you know i don&#39;t i</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.360" end="00:26:42.480" style="s2">don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.000" end="00:26:44.400" style="s2">know um i don&#39;t exactly know where i</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.480" end="00:26:44.960" style="s2">fall between these two opinions on this</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.400" end="00:26:47.760" style="s2">because the</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.960" end="00:26:49.840" style="s2">this was a this is a public institution</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.760" end="00:26:50.960" style="s2">that for over 150 years have been male</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.840" end="00:26:52.799" style="s2">only</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.960" end="00:26:54.080" style="s2">and the argument was that it was</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.799" end="00:26:56.159" style="s2">effectively a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.080" end="00:26:57.760" style="s2">a militarized education that was not</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.159" end="00:26:59.520" style="s2">mostly training people for the military</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.760" end="00:27:01.919" style="s2">only about 15</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.520" end="00:27:03.760" style="s2">of the the students at vmi apparently</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.919" end="00:27:07.600" style="s2">went into the military</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.760" end="00:27:11.919" style="s2">um and</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.600" end="00:27:14.720" style="s2">ruth bader ginsburg&#39;s point uh was</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.919" end="00:27:15.279" style="s2">women there are there are many women</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.720" end="00:27:17.200" style="s2">although</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.279" end="00:27:18.480" style="s2">probably not as many as there are men i</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.200" end="00:27:18.960" style="s2">don&#39;t know that she says that but you</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.480" end="00:27:20.480" style="s2">know my</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.960" end="00:27:22.320" style="s2">my cystical brain goes like okay there</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.480" end="00:27:25.679" style="s2">will be many women although not as many</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.320" end="00:27:28.880" style="s2">as there are men who would benefit from</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.679" end="00:27:30.080" style="s2">and enjoy and be educated by this kind</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.880" end="00:27:33.600" style="s2">of education</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.080" end="00:27:34.640" style="s2">and especially if the argument is not</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.600" end="00:27:37.760" style="s2">that we are training</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.640" end="00:27:39.200" style="s2">soldiers which is a kind of a different</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.760" end="00:27:41.039" style="s2">a different argument potentially</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.200" end="00:27:44.880" style="s2">although obviously women are now</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.039" end="00:27:47.279" style="s2">also acting as soldiers then</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.880" end="00:27:49.520" style="s2">basically what vmi proposed to do was to</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.279" end="00:27:51.200" style="s2">create a separate women&#39;s institute</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.520" end="00:27:52.880" style="s2">which of course did not have you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.200" end="00:27:55.679" style="s2">you create something from scratch in</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.880" end="00:27:56.720" style="s2">1995 or whatever and it&#39;s not going to</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.679" end="00:27:58.399" style="s2">have the history</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.720" end="00:28:00.559" style="s2">and the connections and it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.399" end="00:28:01.679" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s obviously a second-rate</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.559" end="00:28:03.520" style="s2">solution</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.679" end="00:28:05.360" style="s2">it&#39;s a separate but equal phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.520" end="00:28:06.080" style="s2">which of course results in a separate</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.360" end="00:28:08.640" style="s2">but unequal</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.080" end="00:28:09.679" style="s2">right result right exactly and so you</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.640" end="00:28:13.520" style="s2">know are there</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.679" end="00:28:17.120" style="s2">you know but are there not arguments for</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.520" end="00:28:20.320" style="s2">um sex single sex spaces</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.120" end="00:28:22.000" style="s2">yes single sex educational spaces</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.320" end="00:28:24.399" style="s2">probably like both you and i have</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.000" end="00:28:27.520" style="s2">actually attended single sex educational</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.399" end="00:28:28.080" style="s2">spaces me by choice for five weeks i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.520" end="00:28:30.159" style="s2">college</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.080" end="00:28:31.360" style="s2">over it at this point and you know you</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.159" end="00:28:34.880" style="s2">you um</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.360" end="00:28:37.520" style="s2">in junior high and high school um</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.880" end="00:28:38.799" style="s2">until until they politely asked you to</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.520" end="00:28:39.600" style="s2">leave and you came to the school where i</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.799" end="00:28:42.840" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.600" end="00:28:44.080" style="s2">invited to leave i invited was it polite</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.840" end="00:28:45.840" style="s2">though uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.080" end="00:28:47.520" style="s2">very it was a kind of an elite school so</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.840" end="00:28:48.159" style="s2">they were very polite and diplomatic</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.520" end="00:28:50.559" style="s2">very sound</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.159" end="00:28:51.520" style="s2">euphemistic in their invitation for me</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.559" end="00:28:55.120" style="s2">to get the [ __ ] out</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.520" end="00:28:57.200" style="s2">so anyway so i mean so both of us have</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.120" end="00:28:58.960" style="s2">i have only five weeks experience at a</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.200" end="00:29:01.039" style="s2">women&#39;s college and you have</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.960" end="00:29:02.559" style="s2">four years of experience from a lot</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.039" end="00:29:03.760" style="s2">longer ago well actually not that much</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.559" end="00:29:04.640" style="s2">longer ago but when you were when you</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.760" end="00:29:06.960" style="s2">were still</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.640" end="00:29:09.840" style="s2">definitely a child right um let&#39;s put it</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.960" end="00:29:12.799" style="s2">this way exactly the wrong moment to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.840" end="00:29:14.480" style="s2">isolated from girls it was not i think</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.799" end="00:29:16.159" style="s2">it worked out for you okay oh it did in</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.480" end="00:29:17.679" style="s2">the end but that really has more to do</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.159" end="00:29:18.159" style="s2">with the getting kicked out at the right</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.679" end="00:29:20.799" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.159" end="00:29:21.919" style="s2">than the being there in that stifling</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.799" end="00:29:24.960" style="s2">institution yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.919" end="00:29:25.440" style="s2">but so so you who had um you know who</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.960" end="00:29:28.320" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.440" end="00:29:30.399" style="s2">never felt like there were benefits to</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.320" end="00:29:31.279" style="s2">you being in a single sex educational</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.399" end="00:29:34.720" style="s2">environment between the</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.279" end="00:29:37.919" style="s2">ages of uh grades of seven and ten</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.720" end="00:29:39.840" style="s2">can you can you explain why um</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.919" end="00:29:40.960" style="s2">at say the college level there might be</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.840" end="00:29:43.039" style="s2">benefits to</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.960" end="00:29:44.799" style="s2">an all-male environment of course right</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.039" end="00:29:47.840" style="s2">so so do so well</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.799" end="00:29:50.080" style="s2">um let&#39;s just say you know i</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.840" end="00:29:51.840" style="s2">i don&#39;t think the benefits are net in</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.080" end="00:29:54.880" style="s2">general on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.840" end="00:29:58.720" style="s2">um the consequence</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.880" end="00:30:01.039" style="s2">well unfortunately any such analysis</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.720" end="00:30:02.640" style="s2">would be largely predicated</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.039" end="00:30:04.640" style="s2">you know unless we&#39;re talking about an</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.640" end="00:30:06.320" style="s2">education with a</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.640" end="00:30:07.840" style="s2">physical component and even then you</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.320" end="00:30:10.080" style="s2">have to push it fairly far</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.840" end="00:30:11.840" style="s2">before you get to a place where there</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.080" end="00:30:13.760" style="s2">really needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.840" end="00:30:15.520" style="s2">separation so any argument that is not</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.760" end="00:30:18.799" style="s2">based in physical differences</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.520" end="00:30:19.600" style="s2">in uh average capacity between men and</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.799" end="00:30:21.679" style="s2">women</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.600" end="00:30:23.840" style="s2">would be largely predicated on a</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.679" end="00:30:25.760" style="s2">heteronormative viewpoint which would be</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.840" end="00:30:26.559" style="s2">unfair to impose on this so in some</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.760" end="00:30:30.000" style="s2">sense maybe</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.559" end="00:30:33.039" style="s2">the answer is any explanation has uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.000" end="00:30:34.480" style="s2">has dissipated you lost me at</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.039" end="00:30:38.159" style="s2">heteronormative viewpoint</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.480" end="00:30:40.880" style="s2">i&#39;m sorry if you want to do that</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.159" end="00:30:43.840" style="s2">really are you are you serious well i am</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.880" end="00:30:47.200" style="s2">in the sense that there are places where</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.840" end="00:30:49.279" style="s2">let&#39;s just cut to the chase okay</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.200" end="00:30:50.880" style="s2">let&#39;s say because i i know you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.279" end="00:30:52.159" style="s2">noticed but the world is actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.880" end="00:30:54.320" style="s2">heteronormative</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.159" end="00:30:56.559" style="s2">well hetero there&#39;s heteronormative and</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.320" end="00:30:57.760" style="s2">there&#39;s the expectation that everybody</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.559" end="00:30:59.679" style="s2">falls under that</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.760" end="00:31:02.159" style="s2">so this then is again the population</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.679" end="00:31:05.200" style="s2">versus individual level expectation like</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.159" end="00:31:07.679" style="s2">obviously the vast majority of the world</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.200" end="00:31:09.440" style="s2">is heterosexual which is what the hetero</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.679" end="00:31:12.559" style="s2">and heteronormative refers to</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.440" end="00:31:14.640" style="s2">right and um and that is</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.559" end="00:31:16.240" style="s2">that recognizing that is different from</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.640" end="00:31:18.720" style="s2">therefore saying that all the</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.240" end="00:31:20.320" style="s2">all the world must be in all individuals</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.720" end="00:31:23.600" style="s2">in it must be and anything</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.320" end="00:31:26.559" style="s2">veering from that is somehow um off</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.600" end="00:31:28.159" style="s2">or wrong or or or you know not okay so</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.559" end="00:31:29.120" style="s2">this these these two things are both</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.159" end="00:31:30.240" style="s2">true and this is again</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.120" end="00:31:31.840" style="s2">exactly the distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.240" end="00:31:32.960" style="s2">populations and individuals which</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.840" end="00:31:34.480" style="s2">somehow</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.960" end="00:31:36.399" style="s2">most people seem to have a very very</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.480" end="00:31:37.519" style="s2">hard time of holding those two things</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.399" end="00:31:39.679" style="s2">those two concepts</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.519" end="00:31:41.519" style="s2">in their in their heads at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.679" end="00:31:43.919" style="s2">men and women are on average different</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.519" end="00:31:44.960" style="s2">and men and women as individuals should</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.919" end="00:31:46.159" style="s2">be engaged with as</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.960" end="00:31:47.760" style="s2">individuals they are with their</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.159" end="00:31:48.159" style="s2">particular strengths and weaknesses</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.760" end="00:31:50.240" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.159" end="00:31:51.440" style="s2">may well be different than you would</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.240" end="00:31:54.399" style="s2">expect based on</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.440" end="00:31:54.960" style="s2">their the diagnosis of your male or your</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.399" end="00:31:57.120" style="s2">female</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.960" end="00:31:58.880" style="s2">so we have arrived at what i suspect is</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.120" end="00:32:00.000" style="s2">one of the five most important</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.880" end="00:32:03.360" style="s2">principles</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.000" end="00:32:05.200" style="s2">in the entire universe wow</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.360" end="00:32:07.679" style="s2">yeah let&#39;s let&#39;s do it um okay the</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.200" end="00:32:11.279" style="s2">principle is something like</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.679" end="00:32:14.320" style="s2">a highly functional system</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.279" end="00:32:17.840" style="s2">requires discretion applied</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.320" end="00:32:19.440" style="s2">by um sober minds right and so</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.840" end="00:32:22.000" style="s2">what you&#39;ve outlined which i think is</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.440" end="00:32:24.880" style="s2">perfect for ruth bader ginsburg</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.000" end="00:32:26.159" style="s2">is that she was deploying a very</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.880" end="00:32:29.360" style="s2">enlightened</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.159" end="00:32:30.880" style="s2">understanding of equality right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.360" end="00:32:33.919" style="s2">exactly what we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.880" end="00:32:36.720" style="s2">arguing for here which is that</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.919" end="00:32:37.519" style="s2">equal rights is a highly desirable thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.720" end="00:32:41.200" style="s2">that should be</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.519" end="00:32:43.679" style="s2">um defended uh vigorously</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.200" end="00:32:44.559" style="s2">but that that does not mean that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.679" end="00:32:46.640" style="s2">the same</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.559" end="00:32:48.399" style="s2">right and that these two things while</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.640" end="00:32:49.919" style="s2">you know a naive person may conclude</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.399" end="00:32:50.720" style="s2">that one has to be true for the other to</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.919" end="00:32:52.880" style="s2">be true</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.720" end="00:32:54.080" style="s2">a an honest broker will recognize that</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.880" end="00:32:57.440" style="s2">they can&#39;t possibly</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.080" end="00:33:00.880" style="s2">both be right and that the desire to um</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.440" end="00:33:02.080" style="s2">to protect people equally is actually</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.880" end="00:33:03.679" style="s2">unrelated</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.080" end="00:33:05.360" style="s2">to the similarity of those people you</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.679" end="00:33:07.440" style="s2">men and women women don&#39;t have to be the</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.360" end="00:33:09.760" style="s2">same phenomenon and we don&#39;t have to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.440" end="00:33:10.480" style="s2">suffering from an oppressive viewpoint</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.760" end="00:33:12.480" style="s2">that has been</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.480" end="00:33:14.559" style="s2">inflicted on us that separates men from</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.480" end="00:33:16.240" style="s2">women in order to protect men and women</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.559" end="00:33:16.880" style="s2">well but what that means is that you do</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.240" end="00:33:19.919" style="s2">get to</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.880" end="00:33:21.600" style="s2">a spot where you have to acknowledge</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.919" end="00:33:22.559" style="s2">that actually here is one of the places</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.600" end="00:33:26.720" style="s2">where difference</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.559" end="00:33:29.600" style="s2">matters yeah right yeah well and um</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.720" end="00:33:30.320" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it gets it gets dicey</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.600" end="00:33:32.159" style="s2">right so</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.320" end="00:33:34.960" style="s2">in an educational environment which is</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.159" end="00:33:37.360" style="s2">in part even if it&#39;s not the majority</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.960" end="00:33:38.240" style="s2">training men for training men</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.360" end="00:33:41.519" style="s2">historically</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.240" end="00:33:44.159" style="s2">for military duty uh the presence</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.519" end="00:33:46.240" style="s2">of the introduction of a small number of</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.159" end="00:33:48.559" style="s2">women is going to change the dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.240" end="00:33:50.799" style="s2">it 100 is and so this is one of the many</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.559" end="00:33:52.880" style="s2">many ways in which sex is not like race</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.799" end="00:33:54.080" style="s2">and so you know when we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.880" end="00:33:55.679" style="s2">whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.080" end="00:33:57.679" style="s2">you know they&#39;re i don&#39;t even know when</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.679" end="00:33:58.880" style="s2">it happened but you know our we&#39;re black</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.679" end="00:34:01.519" style="s2">soldiers allowed</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.880" end="00:34:02.880" style="s2">uh into the army to fight in world war</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.519" end="00:34:03.200" style="s2">ii and i probably um that&#39;s probably the</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.880" end="00:34:05.120" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.200" end="00:34:06.880" style="s2">moment in history but whatever but often</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.120" end="00:34:09.200" style="s2">grouped together grouped together</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.880" end="00:34:10.720" style="s2">and um but you know there was never</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.200" end="00:34:14.079" style="s2">there never should have been</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.720" end="00:34:16.560" style="s2">any reason at all to protect</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.079" end="00:34:17.679" style="s2">in quotes uh you know white soldiers</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.560" end="00:34:20.000" style="s2">from black soldiers</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.679" end="00:34:20.720" style="s2">that&#39;s wrong that&#39;s insane there is</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.000" end="00:34:23.839" style="s2">there is</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.720" end="00:34:26.000" style="s2">nothing in in soldiering in</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.839" end="00:34:27.119" style="s2">you know being a human that is different</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.000" end="00:34:30.399" style="s2">in that regard with</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.119" end="00:34:32.240" style="s2">you know between between races right but</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.399" end="00:34:34.560" style="s2">men and women is different because this</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.240" end="00:34:36.720" style="s2">is this is a distinction</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.560" end="00:34:37.839" style="s2">that is 500 million years old in our</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.720" end="00:34:41.200" style="s2">lineage alone</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.839" end="00:34:44.240" style="s2">and so it does change the dynamic and</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.200" end="00:34:45.200" style="s2">you know i i say that as someone who has</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.240" end="00:34:47.839" style="s2">benefited</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.200" end="00:34:49.440" style="s2">from the ability of women to move into</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.839" end="00:34:50.560" style="s2">spaces that have been historically male</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.440" end="00:34:53.119" style="s2">in some of those</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.560" end="00:34:54.240" style="s2">spaces they weren&#39;t legitimately</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.119" end="00:34:58.079" style="s2">historically male</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.240" end="00:35:00.640" style="s2">but some like the military</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.079" end="00:35:02.000" style="s2">may well function better without there</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.640" end="00:35:04.160" style="s2">being a small number</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.000" end="00:35:05.440" style="s2">of women present in every situation</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.160" end="00:35:08.960" style="s2">right and so</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.440" end="00:35:12.720" style="s2">uh let us point out that the</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.960" end="00:35:15.599" style="s2">importance it may be that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.720" end="00:35:16.160" style="s2">functional difference in how a you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.599" end="00:35:18.960" style="s2">military</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.160" end="00:35:20.640" style="s2">division functions when it&#39;s mixed sex</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.960" end="00:35:23.920" style="s2">versus not</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.640" end="00:35:26.240" style="s2">in fact you would expect it and what</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.920" end="00:35:27.200" style="s2">rests on it functioning well is</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.240" end="00:35:31.280" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.200" end="00:35:32.960" style="s2">that rises above frankly individual</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.280" end="00:35:34.880" style="s2">protections in fact the entire</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.960" end="00:35:36.320" style="s2">right for us to draft people and send</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.880" end="00:35:38.640" style="s2">them into battle</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.320" end="00:35:39.839" style="s2">you know is because your right to decide</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.640" end="00:35:42.560" style="s2">whether or not to go</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.839" end="00:35:44.240" style="s2">to go into battle cannot override our</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.560" end="00:35:46.000" style="s2">right to marshal the force that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.240" end="00:35:48.240" style="s2">necessary in order to protect</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.000" end="00:35:49.760" style="s2">the thing on which we all depend and so</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.240" end="00:35:51.359" style="s2">because we know that you need a</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.760" end="00:35:54.000" style="s2">deliberative body</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.359" end="00:35:55.640" style="s2">that is capable of recognizing the</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.000" end="00:35:59.040" style="s2">uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.640" end="00:36:02.240" style="s2">asymmetries and like i&#39;ll even take your</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.040" end="00:36:03.520" style="s2">challenge about race here right and boy</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.240" end="00:36:04.240" style="s2">this is a frightening thing to say</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.520" end="00:36:05.520" style="s2">although</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.240" end="00:36:07.440" style="s2">i don&#39;t think there&#39;s any reason that</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.520" end="00:36:09.040" style="s2">this should be a it&#39;s not a difficult</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.440" end="00:36:11.920" style="s2">logical problem at all</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.040" end="00:36:13.280" style="s2">let&#39;s say that you had a situation in</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.920" end="00:36:16.880" style="s2">which a military</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.280" end="00:36:19.440" style="s2">force that intermingled races</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.880" end="00:36:20.240" style="s2">worked less well was militarily less</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.440" end="00:36:22.720" style="s2">effective</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.240" end="00:36:23.440" style="s2">because of distrust between the races</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.720" end="00:36:26.000" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.440" end="00:36:26.960" style="s2">the same logic applies you want to fix</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.000" end="00:36:29.040" style="s2">that so that that&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.960" end="00:36:30.480" style="s2">not true you want to address whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.040" end="00:36:33.200" style="s2">is that causes distrust</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.480" end="00:36:34.640" style="s2">between the races to compromise the</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.200" end="00:36:36.720" style="s2">force militarily</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.640" end="00:36:38.480" style="s2">but to the extent that the existence of</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.720" end="00:36:38.960" style="s2">the nation might depend on grouping</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.480" end="00:36:40.960" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.960" end="00:36:42.800" style="s2">with those they don&#39;t mistrust you would</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.960" end="00:36:44.880" style="s2">have to have discretion to do that</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.800" end="00:36:46.800" style="s2">as you corrected the thing that caused</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.880" end="00:36:50.400" style="s2">the mistrust</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.800" end="00:36:54.000" style="s2">yeah i don&#39;t know i don&#39;t know because</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.400" end="00:36:56.480" style="s2">um you know recognition of difference is</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.000" end="00:36:57.359" style="s2">certainly as you know older than being</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.480" end="00:37:00.320" style="s2">human</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.359" end="00:37:01.839" style="s2">what what social organisms do in part is</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.320" end="00:37:04.240" style="s2">recognize individuals as</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.839" end="00:37:05.520" style="s2">friend or foe or unknown and</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.240" end="00:37:08.720" style="s2">characterize difference</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.520" end="00:37:10.000" style="s2">and this is you know this is a basis for</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.720" end="00:37:12.079" style="s2">tribalism and</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.000" end="00:37:13.839" style="s2">racism and all of these things without</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.079" end="00:37:15.760" style="s2">it being a justification for them it is</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.839" end="00:37:18.960" style="s2">an explanation of them</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.760" end="00:37:22.000" style="s2">at least in part um but</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.960" end="00:37:25.680" style="s2">in in a country that</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.000" end="00:37:28.880" style="s2">prides itself on being a melting pot</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.680" end="00:37:30.560" style="s2">and um having welcomed immigrants to its</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.880" end="00:37:32.720" style="s2">shores from all over the world</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.560" end="00:37:33.920" style="s2">almost from its almost from its origin</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.720" end="00:37:37.680" style="s2">story</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.920" end="00:37:42.240" style="s2">um i i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.680" end="00:37:45.440" style="s2">know that i can imagine justifying</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.240" end="00:37:48.560" style="s2">even the momentary um</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.440" end="00:37:51.760" style="s2">sort of privileging of the the bias</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.560" end="00:37:55.599" style="s2">in the ranks whereas whereas</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.760" end="00:37:58.800" style="s2">um pretending that</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.599" end="00:38:00.079" style="s2">a couple of super awesome badass female</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.800" end="00:38:03.440" style="s2">soldiers</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.079" end="00:38:06.640" style="s2">in uh you know in a remote place with</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.440" end="00:38:10.000" style="s2">40 even super awesome you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.640" end="00:38:12.400" style="s2">non-rapey badass male soldiers</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.000" end="00:38:13.520" style="s2">may really change the situation and</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.400" end="00:38:16.560" style="s2">that&#39;s that is</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.520" end="00:38:18.880" style="s2">a that is a</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.560" end="00:38:20.000" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s older than sociality</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.880" end="00:38:21.680" style="s2">that&#39;s older than</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.000" end="00:38:23.359" style="s2">that&#39;s so much older than everything</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.680" end="00:38:25.040" style="s2">else that we&#39;re talking about right</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.359" end="00:38:26.480" style="s2">so i&#39;m not making the argument you think</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.040" end="00:38:27.200" style="s2">i&#39;m making okay i&#39;m not making the</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.480" end="00:38:30.320" style="s2">argument that</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.200" end="00:38:33.119" style="s2">race is such a phenomenon because</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.320" end="00:38:33.760" style="s2">of course the thing about the way human</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.119" end="00:38:35.920" style="s2">beings</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.760" end="00:38:37.839" style="s2">actually work is that some of the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.920" end="00:38:39.760" style="s2">is in the software layer and while there</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.839" end="00:38:41.520" style="s2">is historical distrust between races</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.760" end="00:38:42.400" style="s2">based in biology there is also</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.520" end="00:38:46.160" style="s2">plasticity</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.400" end="00:38:46.560" style="s2">that allows it to be refactored yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.160" end="00:38:48.079" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.560" end="00:38:49.680" style="s2">so i&#39;m not arguing that this is such a</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.079" end="00:38:53.119" style="s2">place what i&#39;m arguing is</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.680" end="00:38:55.200" style="s2">if it were such a place and the ability</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.119" end="00:38:56.560" style="s2">of the population including all of its</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.200" end="00:39:00.640" style="s2">races to continue</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.560" end="00:39:04.000" style="s2">involved fielding uh military uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.640" end="00:39:06.160" style="s2">um groupings that functioned</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.000" end="00:39:08.800" style="s2">then that would have the priority right</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.160" end="00:39:11.040" style="s2">so in the moment to win the battle</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.800" end="00:39:12.640" style="s2">right and so really what i&#39;m arguing</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.040" end="00:39:14.400" style="s2">goes back to your point about ginsburg</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.640" end="00:39:15.839" style="s2">which again i&#39;m saying is</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.400" end="00:39:17.280" style="s2">you know one of the five most important</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.839" end="00:39:18.480" style="s2">principles in the universe and mind you</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.280" end="00:39:20.240" style="s2">i was gonna i&#39;m gonna have to sit down</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.480" end="00:39:23.280" style="s2">and figure what the other four are but</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.240" end="00:39:26.640" style="s2">um but the point</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.280" end="00:39:29.920" style="s2">is it is the discretion that a</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.640" end="00:39:30.240" style="s2">decent person who is capable of taking</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.920" end="00:39:31.920" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.240" end="00:39:34.400" style="s2">all of the information not just about</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.920" end="00:39:36.960" style="s2">our aspirations who we want to be</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.400" end="00:39:39.359" style="s2">right but who we actually are and what</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.960" end="00:39:42.400" style="s2">is necessary in order for us to get</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.359" end="00:39:44.720" style="s2">where we&#39;re going right that discretion</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.400" end="00:39:46.400" style="s2">is key and it is why the supreme court</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.720" end="00:39:48.480" style="s2">was placed in the position that it was</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.400" end="00:39:49.839" style="s2">placed it&#39;s why it&#39;s configured as it is</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.480" end="00:39:53.440" style="s2">configured it&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.839" end="00:39:54.560" style="s2">you have uh these you know terms for</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.440" end="00:39:57.680" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.560" end="00:39:59.359" style="s2">um and to scalia&#39;s point it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.680" end="00:40:01.119" style="s2">the earliest documents the founding</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.359" end="00:40:03.680" style="s2">documents of the united states</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.119" end="00:40:04.400" style="s2">states precisely give us the freedom to</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.680" end="00:40:07.280" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.400" end="00:40:07.839" style="s2">to not be limited to the biases of our</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.280" end="00:40:10.160" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.839" end="00:40:12.160" style="s2">and all times we&#39;ll have biases and some</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.160" end="00:40:14.079" style="s2">of them we can&#39;t even begin to imagine</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.160" end="00:40:15.760" style="s2">yet right and especially the way he</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.079" end="00:40:17.040" style="s2">phrases it his point is the things that</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.760" end="00:40:18.880" style="s2">you are certain are true</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.040" end="00:40:20.400" style="s2">that we will know in the future weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.880" end="00:40:22.839" style="s2">true right</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.400" end="00:40:24.319" style="s2">that thing is why we have to have this</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.839" end="00:40:27.040" style="s2">capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.319" end="00:40:28.400" style="s2">to deliberate over over what what is</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.040" end="00:40:30.000" style="s2">true it&#39;s quite an arrogance</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.400" end="00:40:31.520" style="s2">actually um that he&#39;s pointing to and i</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.000" end="00:40:33.119" style="s2">don&#39;t think i don&#39;t think he uses that</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.520" end="00:40:35.520" style="s2">word but it&#39;s you know it&#39;s arrogance</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.119" end="00:40:37.040" style="s2">it&#39;s hubris to imagine that now right</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.520" end="00:40:39.680" style="s2">now we finally arrived</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.040" end="00:40:41.200" style="s2">at the perfect moral center of humanity</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.680" end="00:40:43.440" style="s2">and everyone in the past</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.200" end="00:40:44.640" style="s2">got it wrong and no one in the future</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.440" end="00:40:47.119" style="s2">will learn anything</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.640" end="00:40:48.640" style="s2">more and now we&#39;re there we&#39;ve arrived</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.119" end="00:40:50.960" style="s2">and frankly we see this arrogance</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.640" end="00:40:53.280" style="s2">in many academic fields and you know in</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.960" end="00:40:56.400" style="s2">just about frankly every domain</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.280" end="00:40:59.520" style="s2">like it&#39;s this we&#39;re there and</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.400" end="00:41:01.040" style="s2">uh now history has stopped yep well and</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.520" end="00:41:03.359" style="s2">you know where we&#39;re seeing it now that</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.040" end="00:41:06.160" style="s2">is the most frightening of all is in</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.359" end="00:41:06.800" style="s2">the goddamn tech sector right these</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.160" end="00:41:09.760" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.800" end="00:41:10.480" style="s2">actually think that they know what is</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.760" end="00:41:12.319" style="s2">true</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.480" end="00:41:14.400" style="s2">with sufficient clarity that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.319" end="00:41:17.040" style="s2">going to go about labeling</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.400" end="00:41:18.240" style="s2">beliefs as false that they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.040" end="00:41:20.480" style="s2">so specify what you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.240" end="00:41:22.000" style="s2">here well for example actually this is a</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.480" end="00:41:23.520" style="s2">something worth pointing out we</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.000" end="00:41:26.880" style="s2">highlighted two</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.520" end="00:41:29.520" style="s2">heterodox papers about um</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.880" end="00:41:30.720" style="s2">about covid on our last live stream now</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.520" end="00:41:32.160" style="s2">one of them i must say i have some</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.720" end="00:41:35.200" style="s2">trepidations about</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.160" end="00:41:37.920" style="s2">uh the yam paper um but</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.200" end="00:41:38.640" style="s2">the yan paper makes arguments that one</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.920" end="00:41:40.720" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.640" end="00:41:42.560" style="s2">evaluate now some of those arguments i</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.720" end="00:41:44.720" style="s2">think raise questions</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.560" end="00:41:46.160" style="s2">i think everything in that paper is</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.720" end="00:41:48.480" style="s2">evaluable</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.160" end="00:41:50.640" style="s2">it&#39;s evaluatable right it takes the form</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.480" end="00:41:52.160" style="s2">of an evaluatable argument and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.640" end="00:41:54.079" style="s2">i&#39;ve gotten some correspondence from</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.160" end="00:41:57.520" style="s2">people who spotted various things in</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.079" end="00:41:59.440" style="s2">the same paper yep right um nonetheless</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.520" end="00:42:01.119" style="s2">right the tech sector has decided well</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.440" end="00:42:02.160" style="s2">that this is dangerous misinformation</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.119" end="00:42:05.599" style="s2">and they have now</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.160" end="00:42:06.319" style="s2">uh they have suspended her account the</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.599" end="00:42:09.280" style="s2">lead author</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.319" end="00:42:10.319" style="s2">the twitter account right and they are</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.280" end="00:42:12.880" style="s2">labeling</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.319" end="00:42:14.640" style="s2">those who would i think they&#39;re either</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.880" end="00:42:15.440" style="s2">forbidding the posting of the paper or</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.640" end="00:42:18.079" style="s2">labeling it as</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.440" end="00:42:19.200" style="s2">misinformation now here&#39;s the problem</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.079" end="00:42:20.480" style="s2">the other paper that</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.200" end="00:42:21.680" style="s2">wasn&#39;t the paper that we highlighted but</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.480" end="00:42:22.960" style="s2">the other body of work that we</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.680" end="00:42:27.359" style="s2">highlighted</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.960" end="00:42:30.960" style="s2">alina chen on the last broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.359" end="00:42:34.079" style="s2">is the gold standard of evaluation</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.960" end="00:42:38.880" style="s2">of kovid&#39;s origins</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.079" end="00:42:41.920" style="s2">the tech sector regards what</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.880" end="00:42:43.359" style="s2">the second body of work reveals as</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.920" end="00:42:46.240" style="s2">misinformation in other words it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.359" end="00:42:49.280" style="s2">decided that the true story of kovid</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.240" end="00:42:50.319" style="s2">is natural origin so the tech sector is</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.280" end="00:42:53.599" style="s2">acting</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.319" end="00:42:54.640" style="s2">as kind of uh jury judge and executioner</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.599" end="00:42:58.079" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.640" end="00:42:59.440" style="s2">as in a scientific framework like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.079" end="00:43:01.680" style="s2">pretending to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.440" end="00:43:03.040" style="s2">to do the job of peer review in a</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.680" end="00:43:03.680" style="s2">perfect world where peer review was</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.040" end="00:43:06.079" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.680" end="00:43:07.280" style="s2">assessing these things right it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.079" end="00:43:10.480" style="s2">completely</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.280" end="00:43:13.920" style="s2">insulated unassailable kind of super</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.480" end="00:43:15.359" style="s2">review yeah and the thing is we know</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.920" end="00:43:17.440" style="s2">that the mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.359" end="00:43:19.760" style="s2">by which the mainstream arrived at the</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.440" end="00:43:20.400" style="s2">conclusion that this was clearly natural</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.760" end="00:43:23.119" style="s2">origin</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.400" end="00:43:24.319" style="s2">has again and again been wrong right we</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.119" end="00:43:27.280" style="s2">knew it was the</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.319" end="00:43:29.119" style="s2">wuhan seafood market we now know it</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.280" end="00:43:30.720" style="s2">wasn&#39;t the wuhan seafood market</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.119" end="00:43:33.599" style="s2">we thought that the spike protein</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.720" end="00:43:35.520" style="s2">indicated uh connection with pangolins</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.599" end="00:43:36.319" style="s2">we now know that it wasn&#39;t pangolin so</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.520" end="00:43:38.240" style="s2">the point is look</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.319" end="00:43:40.400" style="s2">this is the way science works the right</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.240" end="00:43:42.960" style="s2">certainties fall away with never any</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.400" end="00:43:44.960" style="s2">any even recognition that actually we we</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.960" end="00:43:46.480" style="s2">said we were 100 certain back then</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.960" end="00:43:47.760" style="s2">and we were wrong and i mean this is</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.480" end="00:43:49.119" style="s2">something that you have done with our</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.760" end="00:43:51.920" style="s2">children very effectively</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.119" end="00:43:53.119" style="s2">when they make a claim and you say how</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.920" end="00:43:55.280" style="s2">sure are you of that</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.119" end="00:43:56.800" style="s2">any point that they come up with i&#39;m 100</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.280" end="00:43:58.560" style="s2">certain you say you&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.800" end="00:44:00.800" style="s2">really careful with that right because</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.560" end="00:44:02.800" style="s2">there are some things that we can be 100</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.800" end="00:44:05.200" style="s2">certain of you know assuming that the</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.800" end="00:44:07.040" style="s2">sun rises tomorrow it will rise</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.200" end="00:44:09.359" style="s2">in the east right it will it will it</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.040" end="00:44:12.880" style="s2">will not come up in a different place</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.359" end="00:44:14.880" style="s2">but uh for nearly</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.880" end="00:44:16.480" style="s2">all observations that are parts of</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.880" end="00:44:17.680" style="s2">complex systems especially if they have</p>

<p begin="00:44:17.680" end="00:44:21.359" style="s2">do not put your certainty at 100 well</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.079" end="00:44:23.760" style="s2">and when you</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.359" end="00:44:25.760" style="s2">have tried to put your certainty at some</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.760" end="00:44:27.680" style="s2">percentage</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.760" end="00:44:29.200" style="s2">keep track of what happens keep track of</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.680" end="00:44:32.319" style="s2">your predictions and keep</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.200" end="00:44:33.520" style="s2">track of whether or not your estimates</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.319" end="00:44:35.119" style="s2">of your uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.520" end="00:44:36.880" style="s2">and your accuracy and your predictions</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.119" end="00:44:38.000" style="s2">are getting closer and closer over time</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.880" end="00:44:39.119" style="s2">because if they&#39;re not you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.000" end="00:44:42.000" style="s2">something wrong</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.119" end="00:44:43.520" style="s2">i agree although i would say you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.000" end="00:44:46.480" style="s2">need all of that caveat</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.520" end="00:44:47.280" style="s2">about um things about which we can be</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.480" end="00:44:48.960" style="s2">actually certain</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.280" end="00:44:50.480" style="s2">like if the sun rises it&#39;ll rise in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.960" end="00:44:53.440" style="s2">east even that</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.480" end="00:44:54.800" style="s2">right now my point would not be that it</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.440" end="00:44:57.760" style="s2">is worth spending</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.800" end="00:44:59.119" style="s2">an iota of time worrying about the sun</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.760" end="00:45:00.640" style="s2">coming up somewhere other than in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.119" end="00:45:03.280" style="s2">east</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.640" end="00:45:04.800" style="s2">my point would be that you need to</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.280" end="00:45:07.280" style="s2">formally recognize</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.800" end="00:45:09.359" style="s2">that everything that you believe you</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.280" end="00:45:11.200" style="s2">have effective certainty over</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.359" end="00:45:12.960" style="s2">is predicated on certain assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.200" end="00:45:13.680" style="s2">which are themselves not perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.960" end="00:45:16.720" style="s2">secure</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.680" end="00:45:19.839" style="s2">right you do not know that you are not</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.720" end="00:45:22.160" style="s2">having a um</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.839" end="00:45:24.240" style="s2">hallucination that everything that you</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.160" end="00:45:26.640" style="s2">believe to be true your own name</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.240" end="00:45:28.880" style="s2">your relationships where you live that</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.640" end="00:45:32.880" style="s2">all of that is not the product of some</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.880" end="00:45:33.599" style="s2">um some scenario that you&#39;re unaware of</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.880" end="00:45:36.240" style="s2">and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.599" end="00:45:37.680" style="s2">we even now talk about such scenarios i</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.240" end="00:45:39.040" style="s2">don&#39;t take them seriously because i</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.680" end="00:45:39.680" style="s2">think the chances of them being right</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.040" end="00:45:42.160" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.680" end="00:45:43.520" style="s2">virtually zero but they&#39;re not zero this</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.160" end="00:45:46.160" style="s2">could be a simulation</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.520" end="00:45:47.760" style="s2">right if it&#39;s a simulation then all of</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.160" end="00:45:49.200" style="s2">the things that you believe about suns</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.760" end="00:45:51.520" style="s2">coming up in places</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.200" end="00:45:52.640" style="s2">isn&#39;t literal right it&#39;s something else</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.520" end="00:45:53.839" style="s2">it&#39;s something happening inside a</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.640" end="00:45:57.119" style="s2">simulation so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.839" end="00:45:58.000" style="s2">my point to our children is if you say</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.119" end="00:45:59.680" style="s2">i&#39;m 100</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.000" end="00:46:01.119" style="s2">certain that the sun will rise in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.680" end="00:46:03.359" style="s2">east tomorrow</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.119" end="00:46:04.880" style="s2">what you are really saying is that the</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.359" end="00:46:07.680" style="s2">chances that it won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.880" end="00:46:09.440" style="s2">are sufficiently small to be negligible</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.680" end="00:46:12.880" style="s2">right you are not saying they are</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.440" end="00:46:13.359" style="s2">actually zero and so um so the exercise</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.880" end="00:46:15.520" style="s2">that i</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.359" end="00:46:16.480" style="s2">i do run with our children is when</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.520" end="00:46:18.880" style="s2">things are</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.480" end="00:46:20.839" style="s2">substantially more uncertain than that</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.880" end="00:46:24.160" style="s2">like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.839" end="00:46:25.839" style="s2">99.5 certain then you need to know the</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.160" end="00:46:27.119" style="s2">difference between i&#39;m rounding to a</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.839" end="00:46:29.520" style="s2">hundred</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.119" end="00:46:30.400" style="s2">i&#39;m 100 certain it&#39;s going to happen but</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.520" end="00:46:32.560" style="s2">the point is</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.400" end="00:46:33.839" style="s2">what would you rate the chances of its</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.560" end="00:46:36.720" style="s2">you know not</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.839" end="00:46:38.319" style="s2">happening right well actually you can be</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.720" end="00:46:42.480" style="s2">specific about it and</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.319" end="00:46:44.000" style="s2">um that that exercise leaves you in a</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.480" end="00:46:45.760" style="s2">a very different landscape because in</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.000" end="00:46:47.119" style="s2">general people&#39;s beliefs are i either</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.760" end="00:46:48.160" style="s2">believe this to be true or i believe it</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.119" end="00:46:50.720" style="s2">to be false and if</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.160" end="00:46:52.640" style="s2">every place you do that you substitute</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.720" end="00:46:55.760" style="s2">the chances that i think this</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.640" end="00:46:56.000" style="s2">is true are above x and that is enough</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.760" end="00:46:58.240" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.000" end="00:46:59.280" style="s2">me to you know to operate on that</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.240" end="00:47:02.400" style="s2">assumption</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.280" end="00:47:03.839" style="s2">right then you are capable at the point</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.400" end="00:47:04.720" style="s2">you discover that something that you</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.839" end="00:47:06.960" style="s2">thought was</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.720" end="00:47:08.560" style="s2">you know 95 and a half percent certain</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.960" end="00:47:10.319" style="s2">is only 75</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.560" end="00:47:12.160" style="s2">certain you don&#39;t have to switch camps</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.319" end="00:47:14.079" style="s2">you can back off</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.160" end="00:47:16.560" style="s2">your certainty you&#39;re still in uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.079" end="00:47:18.480" style="s2">probabilistic territory as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.560" end="00:47:20.319" style="s2">black and white no nuanced territory we</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.480" end="00:47:20.640" style="s2">are always in probabilistic territory</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.319" end="00:47:22.559" style="s2">even</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.640" end="00:47:24.640" style="s2">well no but you but the point i&#39;m making</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.559" end="00:47:26.400" style="s2">is that you just said switch camps yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.640" end="00:47:28.079" style="s2">and one of those camps is does not</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.400" end="00:47:28.720" style="s2">understand itself to be in probabilistic</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.079" end="00:47:31.280" style="s2">territory</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.720" end="00:47:31.839" style="s2">even though it is right it is in that</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.280" end="00:47:33.680" style="s2">camp</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.839" end="00:47:35.359" style="s2">whether it is operating in that universe</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.680" end="00:47:37.200" style="s2">whether it understands it or not and so</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.359" end="00:47:38.960" style="s2">it&#39;s constantly making errors and so the</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.200" end="00:47:43.839" style="s2">tech sector and its</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.960" end="00:47:45.760" style="s2">um absolutely mind-boggling arrogance in</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.839" end="00:47:46.960" style="s2">deciding that it is going to wade into a</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.760" end="00:47:49.040" style="s2">landscape</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.960" end="00:47:51.520" style="s2">where the mainstream has already gotten</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.040" end="00:47:54.000" style="s2">it wrong a bunch of times and lots of</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.520" end="00:47:56.240" style="s2">highly credible people are now looking</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.000" end="00:47:59.119" style="s2">at the mainstream story and saying</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.240" end="00:48:00.400" style="s2">here is where it is wrong right here is</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.119" end="00:48:02.480" style="s2">the probability</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.400" end="00:48:03.920" style="s2">that you know something like a lab leak</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.480" end="00:48:06.160" style="s2">is true</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.920" end="00:48:08.319" style="s2">right yes if you took a vote would you</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.160" end="00:48:10.400" style="s2">find that mainstream virology</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.319" end="00:48:12.000" style="s2">was you know more or less united around</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.400" end="00:48:15.119" style="s2">the idea that this was a natural</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.000" end="00:48:17.680" style="s2">emergence you would means nothing right</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.119" end="00:48:19.359" style="s2">so the point is as i as i used to always</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.680" end="00:48:20.319" style="s2">say to my classes reality is not</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.359" end="00:48:22.240" style="s2">democratic</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.319" end="00:48:23.760" style="s2">science is not democratic that&#39;s not how</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.240" end="00:48:26.000" style="s2">it works</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.760" end="00:48:27.280" style="s2">yeah in fact what&#39;s what&#39;s true is true</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.000" end="00:48:29.680" style="s2">regardless of whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.280" end="00:48:30.720" style="s2">anyone yet knows or believes it to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.680" end="00:48:32.559" style="s2">true</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.720" end="00:48:34.720" style="s2">yeah meadowwar i&#39;m trying to remember</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.559" end="00:48:38.240" style="s2">what the exact quote is but pb meadow r</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.720" end="00:48:39.839" style="s2">uh nobel laureate um</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.240" end="00:48:41.920" style="s2">once said something to the effect of</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.839" end="00:48:44.000" style="s2">it&#39;s amazing how little effect</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.920" end="00:48:45.119" style="s2">your desires have over what&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.000" end="00:48:48.319" style="s2">true that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.119" end="00:48:51.839" style="s2">see if i can find it while you yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.319" end="00:48:54.160" style="s2">all right um so in any case the</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.839" end="00:48:55.119" style="s2">necessity of civilization functioning</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.160" end="00:48:57.520" style="s2">requires</p>

<p begin="00:49:00.480" end="00:49:06.480" style="s2">various concerns right and</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.079" end="00:49:07.680" style="s2">the aspiration to fairness does not</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.480" end="00:49:10.000" style="s2">override</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.680" end="00:49:11.119" style="s2">the subtlety as frustrating as some of</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.000" end="00:49:14.319" style="s2">them may be</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.119" end="00:49:16.000" style="s2">about you know the way</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.319" end="00:49:17.359" style="s2">different populations like male and</p>

<p begin="00:49:20.880" end="00:49:25.040" style="s2">said i cannot give any scientist of any</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.440" end="00:49:26.480" style="s2">age better advice than this</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.040" end="00:49:28.640" style="s2">the intensity of a conviction that a</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.480" end="00:49:31.359" style="s2">hypothesis is true has no bearing over</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.640" end="00:49:34.160" style="s2">whether it is true or not</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.359" end="00:49:35.520" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting how that&#39;s exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.160" end="00:49:37.680" style="s2">uh the quote i</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.520" end="00:49:39.119" style="s2">almost deployed here means but the</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.680" end="00:49:40.240" style="s2">wording is very different and i remember</p>

<p begin="00:49:42.160" end="00:49:49.680" style="s2">but in any case all right so uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.480" end="00:49:52.400" style="s2">we should uh continue with ginsberg if</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.680" end="00:49:55.359" style="s2">there&#39;s more to say about</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.400" end="00:49:57.119" style="s2">um about her did you have more uh i mean</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.359" end="00:49:58.000" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s plenty to talk about but</p>

<p begin="00:50:27.760" end="00:50:34.000" style="s2">biden said in his remarks</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.440" end="00:50:36.160" style="s2">was that um the number of days</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.000" end="00:50:38.000" style="s2">i don&#39;t remember the exact number but</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.160" end="00:50:38.559" style="s2">the number of days to the election is</p>

<p begin="00:50:38.559" end="00:50:42.960" style="s2">shorter than the minimum time any</p>

<p begin="00:50:42.960" end="00:50:46.720" style="s2">to be confirmed right so that would seem</p>

<p begin="00:50:46.720" end="00:50:49.839" style="s2">that this is impossible and we should</p>

<p begin="00:50:52.960" end="00:51:00.640" style="s2">well um i don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve seen</p>

<p begin="00:51:11.599" end="00:51:15.040" style="s2">so this is you know this is almost two</p>

<p begin="00:51:15.040" end="00:51:18.880" style="s2">earlier uh than we are right now in the</p>

<p begin="00:51:18.880" end="00:51:23.200" style="s2">but it is you know four years ago four</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.880" end="00:51:25.119" style="s2">years ago plus three weeks</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.200" end="00:51:26.480" style="s2">in which the then sitting president who</p>

<p begin="00:51:31.119" end="00:51:36.400" style="s2">fill a vacancy right so um</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.240" end="00:51:37.920" style="s2">i have almost no doubt barack obama will</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.400" end="00:51:39.040" style="s2">not come out in favor of filling the</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.920" end="00:51:42.079" style="s2">vacancy</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.040" end="00:51:43.839" style="s2">um this time but i want people to think</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.079" end="00:51:46.559" style="s2">a little bit if they haven&#39;t already</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.839" end="00:51:49.200" style="s2">at what the implications are of filling</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.559" end="00:51:51.839" style="s2">or not filling the vacancy first of all</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.200" end="00:51:53.520" style="s2">we are in a situation where people are</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.839" end="00:51:56.880" style="s2">um</p>

<p begin="00:52:01.040" end="00:52:05.599" style="s2">there are many scenarios in which an</p>

<p begin="00:52:06.960" end="00:52:12.079" style="s2">the fact of a supreme court that now has</p>

<p begin="00:52:12.079" end="00:52:17.119" style="s2">on it rather than an odd number of</p>

<p begin="00:52:30.640" end="00:52:33.520" style="s2">it&#39;s the difference between an even</p>

<p begin="00:52:33.520" end="00:52:38.400" style="s2">between an even number and an odd number</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.359" end="00:52:41.359" style="s2">what&#39;s more the democrats and</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.400" end="00:52:42.079" style="s2">um you know again it&#39;s very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.359" end="00:52:44.880" style="s2">that we have</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.079" end="00:52:46.800" style="s2">a mirror image of this scenario in the</p>

<p begin="00:52:46.800" end="00:52:53.599" style="s2">but the democrats have a lot</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.000" end="00:52:56.160" style="s2">riding on the idea that one</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.599" end="00:52:57.839" style="s2">absolutely has no choice but to vote for</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.160" end="00:53:00.400" style="s2">biden no matter what you think of him</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.839" end="00:53:02.640" style="s2">blue no matter who because</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.400" end="00:53:04.960" style="s2">the next president will certainly be</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.640" end="00:53:06.559" style="s2">replacing ruth bader ginsburg</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.960" end="00:53:08.319" style="s2">right now it&#39;s not just ruth bader</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.559" end="00:53:10.240" style="s2">ginsburg but the fact that she has died</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.319" end="00:53:13.359" style="s2">and could plausibly be replaced</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.240" end="00:53:15.599" style="s2">on the court before the election</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.359" end="00:53:17.839" style="s2">robs the democrats of an argument that</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.599" end="00:53:20.480" style="s2">they are using to badger people</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.839" end="00:53:21.119" style="s2">into not thinking for themselves right</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.480" end="00:53:23.119" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.119" end="00:53:26.640" style="s2">as somebody who you know sticks just got</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.119" end="00:53:29.200" style="s2">higher the stakes just got higher and if</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.640" end="00:53:29.680" style="s2">trump manages to seat a justice on the</p>

<p begin="00:53:29.680" end="00:53:36.000" style="s2">ahead of time the stakes um</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.880" end="00:53:40.000" style="s2">drop and because they drop those</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.000" end="00:53:42.559" style="s2">who have been badgered into</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.000" end="00:53:43.760" style="s2">signing up with the democratic party</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.559" end="00:53:46.160" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.760" end="00:53:48.000" style="s2">be freed in some sense you know not</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.160" end="00:53:48.800" style="s2">fully but the degree of pressure that</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.000" end="00:53:50.800" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.800" end="00:53:52.079" style="s2">face when they talk about alternatives</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.800" end="00:53:54.839" style="s2">to the duopoly</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.079" end="00:53:56.240" style="s2">that pressure would drop somewhat and so</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.839" end="00:53:59.760" style="s2">anyway</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.240" end="00:54:02.319" style="s2">this of course opens a</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.760" end="00:54:03.599" style="s2">strategic play for the president and you</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.319" end="00:54:06.079" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.599" end="00:54:07.440" style="s2">you and i are no fans of the president</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.079" end="00:54:10.559" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.440" end="00:54:13.040" style="s2">um we do recognize that he has</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.559" end="00:54:15.200" style="s2">sufficient political insight to have</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.040" end="00:54:16.640" style="s2">actually defeated one of the duopoly</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.200" end="00:54:19.680" style="s2">powers and taken over</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.640" end="00:54:22.559" style="s2">the gop so it is not beyond</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.680" end="00:54:23.440" style="s2">him in any way to see that he has an</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.559" end="00:54:26.640" style="s2">opportunity here</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.440" end="00:54:29.839" style="s2">especially if he was to quickly</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.640" end="00:54:33.280" style="s2">nominate somebody who was like</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.839" end="00:54:36.559" style="s2">ginsburg capable of</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.280" end="00:54:38.640" style="s2">reaching across the aisle appealing to</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.559" end="00:54:41.200" style="s2">people on both sides</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.640" end="00:54:42.240" style="s2">you know unimpeachable in terms of their</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.200" end="00:54:44.319" style="s2">character</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.240" end="00:54:45.760" style="s2">right were he to do a character in their</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.319" end="00:54:48.880" style="s2">history right</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.760" end="00:54:52.160" style="s2">right in other words if he were to find</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.880" end="00:54:53.839" style="s2">just the right person then the democrats</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.160" end="00:54:57.440" style="s2">for strategic reasons</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.839" end="00:54:58.640" style="s2">would i believe um be hostile to that</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.440" end="00:55:01.760" style="s2">nomination</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.640" end="00:55:04.960" style="s2">uh and would be revealed to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.760" end="00:55:07.920" style="s2">as cynical and political as the dnc has</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.960" end="00:55:09.359" style="s2">has made the party and that would be a</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.920" end="00:55:12.640" style="s2">win for trump</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.359" end="00:55:12.640" style="s2">so um</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.599" end="00:55:19.359" style="s2">this is a this is a very powerful shift</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.599" end="00:55:21.280" style="s2">in the electoral landscape</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.359" end="00:55:24.160" style="s2">for many different reasons at many</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.280" end="00:55:26.240" style="s2">different levels and</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.160" end="00:55:27.680" style="s2">i don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen but</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.240" end="00:55:31.119" style="s2">i would say</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.680" end="00:55:32.559" style="s2">my guess is this works for trump and</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.119" end="00:55:34.240" style="s2">against the democrats and that the</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.559" end="00:55:36.640" style="s2">democrats to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.240" end="00:55:38.000" style="s2">that they are actually interested in the</p>

<p begin="00:55:38.000" end="00:55:41.200" style="s2">well-being of the nation would be wise</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.480" end="00:55:43.839" style="s2">to move</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.200" end="00:55:45.359" style="s2">very very carefully they should really</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.839" end="00:55:46.160" style="s2">think about what they&#39;re doing and they</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.359" end="00:55:48.319" style="s2">should not</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.160" end="00:55:50.559" style="s2">just simply play the same disastrous</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.319" end="00:55:54.559" style="s2">political game that they have been</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.559" end="00:55:55.920" style="s2">uh so strenuously advocating for so long</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.559" end="00:55:57.599" style="s2">so you&#39;re advocating that they come up</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.920" end="00:55:59.839" style="s2">with a new game right now</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.599" end="00:56:01.200" style="s2">i&#39;m advocating as they wake the hell up</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.839" end="00:56:02.480" style="s2">all right so neither of those things</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.200" end="00:56:03.920" style="s2">your framing or mine</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.480" end="00:56:06.160" style="s2">come up with a new game or wake the hell</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.920" end="00:56:09.760" style="s2">up are likely to happen</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.160" end="00:56:13.280" style="s2">well um yes on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.760" end="00:56:16.640" style="s2">this um the fact</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.280" end="00:56:18.640" style="s2">of them being proactive in trying to</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.640" end="00:56:21.920" style="s2">shut down the idea of seeding</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.640" end="00:56:24.880" style="s2">a justice um and you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.920" end="00:56:26.480" style="s2">playing with bizarre ideas like adding</p>

<p begin="00:56:34.559" end="00:56:37.520" style="s2">it&#39;s an idea that has been</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.920" end="00:56:39.440" style="s2">circulating my sense is that it is an</p>

<p begin="00:56:39.440" end="00:56:42.640" style="s2">um and that you know look there&#39;s a lot</p>

<p begin="00:56:45.839" end="00:56:52.079" style="s2">nine is a lot nine is odd um</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.359" end="00:56:52.480" style="s2">it seems to me that a justification for</p>

<p begin="00:56:52.480" end="00:56:57.200" style="s2">you know really the the only one that i</p>

<p begin="00:56:57.200" end="00:57:01.599" style="s2">is so transparently political that no</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.520" end="00:57:02.880" style="s2">way does whatever party is not in power</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.599" end="00:57:04.319" style="s2">agreed to it which is that</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.880" end="00:57:06.319" style="s2">we&#39;ve decided to do that and at the</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.319" end="00:57:08.640" style="s2">moment we decide to do it our president</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.319" end="00:57:10.319" style="s2">gets to appoint the two new people um is</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.640" end="00:57:12.480" style="s2">there is there any legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.319" end="00:57:14.000" style="s2">reason for an 11 versus a nine person</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.480" end="00:57:15.440" style="s2">court i mean there may well be it just</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.000" end="00:57:16.400" style="s2">doesn&#39;t i&#39;ve never heard this before and</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.440" end="00:57:18.400" style="s2">nothing comes to mind</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.400" end="00:57:19.520" style="s2">i do not believe so i believe that this</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.400" end="00:57:21.280" style="s2">is um</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.520" end="00:57:23.599" style="s2">nakedly political now i do not want to</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.280" end="00:57:25.599" style="s2">say nakedly political is just a feature</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.599" end="00:57:27.359" style="s2">of the democrats when it comes to the</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.599" end="00:57:28.319" style="s2">supreme court the democrats would tell</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.359" end="00:57:30.559" style="s2">you that they are</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.319" end="00:57:31.920" style="s2">responding to nakedly political stuff</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.559" end="00:57:32.400" style="s2">from the right and there has been quite</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.920" end="00:57:35.040" style="s2">a bit</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.400" end="00:57:36.559" style="s2">so um it is not as if that game is</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.040" end="00:57:40.400" style="s2">imagined on their part</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.559" end="00:57:42.559" style="s2">nonetheless it is the uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.400" end="00:57:43.520" style="s2">it is exactly this argument that you</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.559" end="00:57:44.799" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.520" end="00:57:47.040" style="s2">they packed the court now we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.799" end="00:57:48.799" style="s2">pack the court um kind of thing and</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.040" end="00:57:50.720" style="s2">we&#39;re going to bend the rules and</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.799" end="00:57:51.839" style="s2">do it our own way that that motivates</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.720" end="00:57:54.240" style="s2">this as far as i can tell</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.839" end="00:57:56.400" style="s2">i mean i guess i just i want to keep</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.240" end="00:57:57.599" style="s2">coming back to this idea that ginsburg</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.400" end="00:58:00.799" style="s2">herself</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.599" end="00:58:02.640" style="s2">was uh looked at somewhat askance</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.799" end="00:58:04.799" style="s2">by some feminist leaders at the time</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.640" end="00:58:06.799" style="s2">because she had worked</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.799" end="00:58:08.799" style="s2">across the aisles and she and across the</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.799" end="00:58:10.000" style="s2">aisle isn&#39;t the right uh metaphor for</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.799" end="00:58:11.280" style="s2">the judiciary but</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.000" end="00:58:12.960" style="s2">that she had worked with judges who were</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.280" end="00:58:13.680" style="s2">understood to be conservative yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.960" end="00:58:16.079" style="s2">she had</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.680" end="00:58:17.599" style="s2">um that and i i think i may have this</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.079" end="00:58:19.680" style="s2">wrong but i think that she and scalia</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.599" end="00:58:21.520" style="s2">actually had a friendship like you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.680" end="00:58:24.559" style="s2">and they they were probably as</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.520" end="00:58:26.000" style="s2">as far opposite on the polls um</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.559" end="00:58:28.400" style="s2">politically on the court</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.000" end="00:58:30.079" style="s2">when they were both on the court as as</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.400" end="00:58:31.359" style="s2">existed and yet</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.079" end="00:58:33.200" style="s2">you know this language that i read from</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.359" end="00:58:36.480" style="s2">both of them they were both right</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.200" end="00:58:38.319" style="s2">like they and you know until</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.480" end="00:58:39.920" style="s2">until today i&#39;d never read anything of</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.319" end="00:58:42.960" style="s2">scalia&#39;s i think</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.920" end="00:58:43.760" style="s2">and if you had asked me what his what</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.960" end="00:58:46.720" style="s2">his</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.760" end="00:58:47.680" style="s2">uh dissents or or statements would have</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.720" end="00:58:50.079" style="s2">sounded like</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.680" end="00:58:51.520" style="s2">uh i would i wouldn&#39;t have guessed that</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.079" end="00:58:53.760" style="s2">they were</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.520" end="00:58:54.880" style="s2">that i could have found so much to agree</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.760" end="00:58:57.920" style="s2">with in them</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.880" end="00:58:58.319" style="s2">well and this this is a lesson you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.920" end="00:59:00.319" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.319" end="00:59:01.680" style="s2">in and around the concept of unity this</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.319" end="00:59:04.960" style="s2">is a constant lesson</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.680" end="00:59:08.799" style="s2">it is amazing how frequently now what</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.960" end="00:59:09.680" style="s2">we thought uh what we heard people say</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.799" end="00:59:12.960" style="s2">and thought was</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.680" end="00:59:15.599" style="s2">true just seems preposterous right like</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.960" end="00:59:17.359" style="s2">i i in my mind i keep returning to the</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.599" end="00:59:19.839" style="s2">concept of mitt romney as</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.359" end="00:59:20.480" style="s2">the greater evil right that we had to</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.839" end="00:59:23.119" style="s2">pull out</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.480" end="00:59:24.640" style="s2">all of the stops to stop mitt romney at</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.119" end="00:59:28.079" style="s2">a point you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.640" end="00:59:29.839" style="s2">where you know that that argument was</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.079" end="00:59:31.440" style="s2">local to a moment in history and the</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.839" end="00:59:32.400" style="s2">fact that the very people making that</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.440" end="00:59:35.520" style="s2">argument</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.400" end="00:59:36.880" style="s2">um are now you know lamenting the fact</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.520" end="00:59:38.960" style="s2">that you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.880" end="00:59:40.880" style="s2">if only the guy on the other side was</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.960" end="00:59:42.079" style="s2">romney because you know now we have the</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.880" end="00:59:45.359" style="s2">real greater evil right</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.079" end="00:59:46.640" style="s2">yeah um so so actually to go back to one</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.359" end="00:59:48.720" style="s2">of your points though so you</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.640" end="00:59:50.000" style="s2">what did you say one of the five most</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.720" end="00:59:51.359" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.000" end="00:59:53.119" style="s2">things in the universe principles</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.359" end="00:59:54.960" style="s2">principles in the universe uh</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.119" end="00:59:56.720" style="s2">is that uh people need to have</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.960" end="00:59:59.040" style="s2">discretion in order to</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.720" end="01:00:00.319" style="s2">humanize laws that&#39;s not exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.040" end="01:00:03.839" style="s2">you know what you want to say yes that</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.319" end="01:00:07.280" style="s2">um functional complex</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.839" end="01:00:11.920" style="s2">systems human systems require</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.280" end="01:00:15.440" style="s2">discretion to be functional so yes</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.920" end="01:00:18.559" style="s2">and uh one of the things that</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.440" end="01:00:21.200" style="s2">that ginsburg was fighting for</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.559" end="01:00:22.559" style="s2">throughout her career was the ability</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.200" end="01:00:26.079" style="s2">for people</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.559" end="01:00:28.960" style="s2">for men to see the effects</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.079" end="01:00:30.079" style="s2">of the the laws that were on the books</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.960" end="01:00:33.520" style="s2">on women</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.079" end="01:00:35.440" style="s2">when in her experience what um men in</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.520" end="01:00:38.559" style="s2">the judiciary and other men</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.440" end="01:00:41.200" style="s2">of power would say was but</p>

<p begin="01:00:49.280" end="01:00:53.520" style="s2">is have discretion held within</p>

<p begin="01:02:00.240" end="01:02:04.799" style="s2">where tenure for life is functional</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.880" end="01:02:07.359" style="s2">right there&#39;s we could we could speak</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.799" end="01:02:08.640" style="s2">for weeks about whether or not tenure in</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.359" end="01:02:10.559" style="s2">the university system</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.640" end="01:02:12.079" style="s2">uh is a good idea and if it is</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.559" end="01:02:14.960" style="s2">effectively worked</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.079" end="01:02:17.520" style="s2">one of the ways it has not worked is</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.960" end="01:02:19.280" style="s2">that often people once they get tenure</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.520" end="01:02:20.960" style="s2">become less productive they become lazy</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.280" end="01:02:22.720" style="s2">they do less and they just</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.960" end="01:02:24.480" style="s2">stay on the same whatever path they were</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.720" end="01:02:26.319" style="s2">on they become canalized in the language</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.480" end="01:02:29.039" style="s2">of developmental biology right</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.319" end="01:02:29.760" style="s2">um and of course that&#39;s just not a</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.039" end="01:02:31.039" style="s2">possibility</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.760" end="01:02:32.880" style="s2">on the supreme court you can&#39;t become</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.039" end="01:02:35.440" style="s2">lazy and stop being productive</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.880" end="01:02:36.160" style="s2">uh you you are going to show up</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.440" end="01:02:39.440" style="s2">constantly</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.160" end="01:02:41.359" style="s2">and continue to do your work um</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.440" end="01:02:42.720" style="s2">i wouldn&#39;t say can&#39;t okay and the</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.359" end="01:02:46.000" style="s2">example that i would pick</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.720" end="01:02:47.920" style="s2">and i&#39;m you know i should really go back</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.000" end="01:02:48.319" style="s2">and look at what the history has been</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.920" end="01:02:49.920" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.319" end="01:02:51.440" style="s2">at the point that justice thomas</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.920" end="01:02:54.880" style="s2">ascended to the court</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.440" end="01:02:56.640" style="s2">he had an extremely strong tendency to</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.880" end="01:02:59.839" style="s2">simply reproduce scalia&#39;s vote</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.640" end="01:03:02.960" style="s2">sure and so that does strike me as</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.839" end="01:03:04.960" style="s2">but that&#39;s not i i remember this too and</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.960" end="01:03:06.240" style="s2">uh i remember being very frustrated by</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.960" end="01:03:09.760" style="s2">the whole situation but</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.240" end="01:03:11.200" style="s2">um that isn&#39;t inherently about laziness</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.760" end="01:03:14.559" style="s2">or not being productive</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.200" end="01:03:18.079" style="s2">um i think the the</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.559" end="01:03:20.559" style="s2">level of agreement the the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.079" end="01:03:21.839" style="s2">as i recall it seemed like lockstep it</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.559" end="01:03:23.520" style="s2">wasn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.839" end="01:03:25.359" style="s2">lockstep it was like scalia made a</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.520" end="01:03:27.520" style="s2">decision and</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.359" end="01:03:28.480" style="s2">basically he was a supreme court justice</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.520" end="01:03:32.000" style="s2">with two votes</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.480" end="01:03:33.920" style="s2">yeah right um now presumably uh that</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.000" end="01:03:35.200" style="s2">tendency has been broken by scalia&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.920" end="01:03:37.359" style="s2">death which</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.200" end="01:03:38.720" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to follow in his footsteps yes</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.359" end="01:03:41.280" style="s2">exactly yeah um but</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.720" end="01:03:42.640" style="s2">in any case tenure for life is</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.280" end="01:03:45.359" style="s2">inherently going to have</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.640" end="01:03:45.839" style="s2">a downside right and you know we saw</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.359" end="01:03:49.599" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.839" end="01:03:51.039" style="s2">at evergreen where um we saw lots and</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.599" end="01:03:54.160" style="s2">lots of faculty members who</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.039" end="01:03:56.799" style="s2">had tenure and you know were</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.160" end="01:03:57.920" style="s2">dead wood at best they were dead wood in</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.799" end="01:03:58.960" style="s2">the system you just couldn&#39;t get rid of</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.920" end="01:04:01.119" style="s2">them and that&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.960" end="01:04:02.079" style="s2">we saw that in in other places as well</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.119" end="01:04:05.119" style="s2">yeah i think ev</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.079" end="01:04:05.680" style="s2">every every system of higher ed with</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.119" end="01:04:07.359" style="s2">tenure</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.680" end="01:04:08.799" style="s2">has this problem there&#39;s a tension there</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.359" end="01:04:10.319" style="s2">yeah and you know it&#39;s the tenure is</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.799" end="01:04:14.079" style="s2">supposed to give you</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.319" end="01:04:15.119" style="s2">the freedom to go outside of the overton</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.079" end="01:04:17.440" style="s2">window basically</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.119" end="01:04:18.480" style="s2">right the freedom to challenge the</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.440" end="01:04:21.039" style="s2">status quo</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.480" end="01:04:23.520" style="s2">and to explore things you haven&#39;t felt</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.039" end="01:04:26.319" style="s2">secure enough to explore before because</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.520" end="01:04:27.039" style="s2">uh you may fail or your answers may be</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.319" end="01:04:29.039" style="s2">ugly</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.039" end="01:04:30.640" style="s2">there are a lot of reasons to not ask</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.039" end="01:04:32.000" style="s2">certain kinds of questions when</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.640" end="01:04:33.280" style="s2">you are trying to figure out whether or</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.000" end="01:04:34.000" style="s2">not you&#39;re going to have money to pay</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.280" end="01:04:35.119" style="s2">the rent</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.000" end="01:04:37.200" style="s2">and at the point that you know that</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.119" end="01:04:38.480" style="s2">you&#39;ve got job security potentially the</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.200" end="01:04:40.559" style="s2">argument goes you can</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.480" end="01:04:41.839" style="s2">you can open it up you can open up all</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.559" end="01:04:43.440" style="s2">of those things that you were sort of</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.839" end="01:04:46.400" style="s2">carefully tending but not</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.440" end="01:04:47.599" style="s2">not working on explicitly um and and</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.400" end="01:04:49.839" style="s2">move forward with them</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.599" end="01:04:51.599" style="s2">um all too often we see the opposite</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.839" end="01:04:54.799" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.599" end="01:04:57.039" style="s2">all right so i think we&#39;re at um an hour</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.799" end="01:04:58.400" style="s2">zach</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.039" end="01:05:00.640" style="s2">an hour and seven minutes so i would</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.400" end="01:05:03.440" style="s2">just to close this out i would say</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.640" end="01:05:04.559" style="s2">what i&#39;m actually hoping will happen is</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.440" end="01:05:08.000" style="s2">that the president</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.559" end="01:05:11.440" style="s2">will advance a uh a</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.000" end="01:05:14.559" style="s2">nominee quickly who is</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.440" end="01:05:16.160" style="s2">um not divisive</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.559" end="01:05:17.760" style="s2">somebody who does have unimpeachable</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.160" end="01:05:21.200" style="s2">character and</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.760" end="01:05:22.960" style="s2">does work across um party lines now</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.200" end="01:05:24.720" style="s2">i don&#39;t think there&#39;s anyone who is not</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.960" end="01:05:27.839" style="s2">divisive well</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.720" end="01:05:30.400" style="s2">depends what you mean um i believe</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.839" end="01:05:31.359" style="s2">there are people who fit the bill the</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.400" end="01:05:34.400" style="s2">problem is</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.359" end="01:05:37.440" style="s2">the president um</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.400" end="01:05:41.359" style="s2">will i think have to</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.440" end="01:05:43.920" style="s2">nominate someone who is uh</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.359" end="01:05:44.799" style="s2">hostile to roe v wade for political</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.920" end="01:05:47.280" style="s2">reasons</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.799" end="01:05:48.720" style="s2">i don&#39;t think he could in his position</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.280" end="01:05:50.720" style="s2">do anything but that</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.720" end="01:05:52.240" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s the only thing</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.720" end="01:05:54.160" style="s2">that you need for it to be</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.240" end="01:05:55.680" style="s2">divisive and you know we don&#39;t we won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.160" end="01:05:56.799" style="s2">do it here today because we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.680" end="01:06:00.400" style="s2">time but</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.799" end="01:06:03.359" style="s2">um you know many</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.400" end="01:06:04.240" style="s2">extraordinary legal scholars will say</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.359" end="01:06:06.160" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.240" end="01:06:07.520" style="s2">uh as you know as apparently ruth bader</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.160" end="01:06:11.280" style="s2">ginsburg</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.520" end="01:06:13.200" style="s2">did uh that while you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.280" end="01:06:15.039" style="s2">you might disagree but many people will</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.200" end="01:06:17.039" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.039" end="01:06:18.880" style="s2">i want abortion to be constitutionally</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.039" end="01:06:21.039" style="s2">constitutionally protected</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.880" end="01:06:22.000" style="s2">and that decision was not the right</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.039" end="01:06:23.680" style="s2">decision</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.000" end="01:06:25.760" style="s2">so how do how do we move forward with</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.680" end="01:06:28.960" style="s2">those two things simultaneously</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.760" end="01:06:31.359" style="s2">um especially when as soon as you even</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.960" end="01:06:32.240" style="s2">begin to consider dismantling a decision</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.359" end="01:06:34.079" style="s2">which might not have been the right</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.240" end="01:06:35.920" style="s2">decision for legal reasons</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.079" end="01:06:37.039" style="s2">and half the come i don&#39;t know what the</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.920" end="01:06:38.640" style="s2">what percentage but you know a</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.039" end="01:06:40.480" style="s2">considerable part of the country really</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.640" end="01:06:41.599" style="s2">doesn&#39;t does not want this right</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.480" end="01:06:43.920" style="s2">protected</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.599" end="01:06:46.000" style="s2">how is it that you move forward and so</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.920" end="01:06:49.200" style="s2">you know clinging to</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.000" end="01:06:52.160" style="s2">a 1973 decision that may have been</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.200" end="01:06:54.000" style="s2">constitutionally not very robust but is</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.160" end="01:06:57.680" style="s2">a right that has provided</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.000" end="01:06:58.319" style="s2">a freedom to you know 46 years of women</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.680" end="01:07:02.000" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.319" end="01:07:04.799" style="s2">that you know many of us</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.000" end="01:07:05.599" style="s2">uh would be terrified to see lost what</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.799" end="01:07:07.839" style="s2">what do you do</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.599" end="01:07:10.079" style="s2">i don&#39;t know i don&#39;t know so i would</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.839" end="01:07:14.160" style="s2">point out that what&#39;s at stake here</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.079" end="01:07:15.920" style="s2">is actually greater as important as this</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.160" end="01:07:18.000" style="s2">question is what&#39;s at stake here is</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.920" end="01:07:21.039" style="s2">actually far greater because</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.000" end="01:07:22.000" style="s2">the role that roe v wade as the</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.039" end="01:07:25.280" style="s2">protector</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.000" end="01:07:26.960" style="s2">of um reproductive rights</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.280" end="01:07:29.920" style="s2">has played has been absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.960" end="01:07:32.799" style="s2">diabolical this has empowered</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.920" end="01:07:34.960" style="s2">um the duopoly above all other things</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.799" end="01:07:36.960" style="s2">because maybe not above all others but</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.960" end="01:07:38.640" style="s2">really maybe the second amendment is the</p>

<p begin="01:07:38.640" end="01:07:43.039" style="s2">way those are the two big things</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.160" end="01:07:44.559" style="s2">right so the point is this has hung like</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.039" end="01:07:48.000" style="s2">a sword of damocles</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.559" end="01:07:51.440" style="s2">over anybody who would contemplate</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.000" end="01:07:52.160" style="s2">a less divisive better political</p>

<p begin="01:07:52.160" end="01:07:58.319" style="s2">it the tyranny that has come to us all</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.839" end="01:07:59.760" style="s2">from the fact that this contentious</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.319" end="01:08:03.119" style="s2">right has hovered</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.760" end="01:08:05.920" style="s2">um you know in jeopardy uh is</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.119" end="01:08:06.880" style="s2">has been a disaster it&#39;s a bit like uh</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.920" end="01:08:10.000" style="s2">anti-castro</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.880" end="01:08:12.079" style="s2">cubans who held uh</p>

<p begin="01:08:12.079" end="01:08:16.799" style="s2">for for so long in florida</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.960" end="01:08:18.400" style="s2">that there&#39;s just the disproportionate</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.799" end="01:08:20.400" style="s2">impact of this is not fundamentally</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.400" end="01:08:22.319" style="s2">reproductive it&#39;s about things like</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.400" end="01:08:24.000" style="s2">political corruption and its ability to</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.319" end="01:08:25.920" style="s2">remain lodged in our</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.000" end="01:08:27.440" style="s2">in our political structures and so what</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.920" end="01:08:31.199" style="s2">i would say is</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.440" end="01:08:34.880" style="s2">the roe v wade decision um</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.199" end="01:08:35.520" style="s2">was i believe cruddy from the point of</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.880" end="01:08:38.719" style="s2">view</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.520" end="01:08:41.199" style="s2">of its basis it was actually</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.719" end="01:08:42.239" style="s2">a good match in terms of what it</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.199" end="01:08:43.839" style="s2">protected</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.239" end="01:08:45.279" style="s2">it was a good match for what the vast</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.839" end="01:08:46.400" style="s2">majority of americans want the vast</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.279" end="01:08:47.839" style="s2">majority of americans</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.400" end="01:08:49.679" style="s2">are not wildly enthusiastic about</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.839" end="01:08:52.719" style="s2">abortion as they shouldn&#39;t be they</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.679" end="01:08:54.640" style="s2">um don&#39;t like it um but</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.719" end="01:08:56.400" style="s2">they do believe the original i mean roe</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.640" end="01:08:58.960" style="s2">v wade actually lays out different</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.400" end="01:08:59.839" style="s2">um rights by trimester absolutely which</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.960" end="01:09:02.960" style="s2">has since been</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.839" end="01:09:05.759" style="s2">modified but um you know really</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.960" end="01:09:06.719" style="s2">if i remember correctly first trimester</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.759" end="01:09:08.480" style="s2">abortion at will</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.719" end="01:09:10.319" style="s2">without explanation or justification</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.480" end="01:09:13.279" style="s2">required by the mother</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.319" end="01:09:14.719" style="s2">second trimester safety of the mother</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.279" end="01:09:17.920" style="s2">the safety of the mother</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.719" end="01:09:21.359" style="s2">um and maybe um or um</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.920" end="01:09:23.040" style="s2">known to be massive genetic or</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.359" end="01:09:23.920" style="s2">developmental anomalies in the fetus i</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.040" end="01:09:26.640" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.920" end="01:09:27.839" style="s2">um and actually i&#39;m not sure that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.640" end="01:09:29.359" style="s2">that&#39;s right because i think the third</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.839" end="01:09:31.839" style="s2">one is only is</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.359" end="01:09:33.440" style="s2">is the third trimester is only about</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.839" end="01:09:34.560" style="s2">life of the mother um so i don&#39;t i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.440" end="01:09:36.080" style="s2">think you have that right for the second</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.560" end="01:09:39.199" style="s2">trimester it&#39;s some it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.080" end="01:09:41.359" style="s2">intermediate and um and</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.199" end="01:09:42.400" style="s2">gosh you know the vast majority of</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.359" end="01:09:45.600" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.400" end="01:09:46.799" style="s2">actually fall somewhere in that</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.600" end="01:09:48.000" style="s2">the idea that you should be able to have</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.799" end="01:09:49.520" style="s2">an abortion the day before the kid would</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.000" end="01:09:51.839" style="s2">be born is insane</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.520" end="01:09:53.839" style="s2">it&#39;s nuts and and most people also don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.839" end="01:09:57.199" style="s2">think that zygotes are god&#39;s will</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.839" end="01:09:58.560" style="s2">right so so so what i would argue is a</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.199" end="01:10:02.000" style="s2">couple of things</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.560" end="01:10:05.840" style="s2">one leaving roe as the protector of this</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.000" end="01:10:07.440" style="s2">right is disastrous because of what else</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.840" end="01:10:10.880" style="s2">it does to our political structure</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.440" end="01:10:12.480" style="s2">right so it&#39;s possible that we need a</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.880" end="01:10:15.040" style="s2">better protection one that&#39;s founded</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.480" end="01:10:16.080" style="s2">on a sounder set of legal principles you</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.040" end="01:10:17.679" style="s2">know rather than</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.080" end="01:10:20.480" style="s2">privacy right protected by the fourth</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.679" end="01:10:23.560" style="s2">amendment but</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.480" end="01:10:25.280" style="s2">it is also possible that somebody who</p>

<p begin="01:10:25.280" end="01:10:29.600" style="s2">is not favorable to abortion rights but</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.239" end="01:10:32.480" style="s2">is favorable</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.600" end="01:10:33.920" style="s2">to the you know starry decisis for</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.480" end="01:10:36.560" style="s2">example which is the</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.920" end="01:10:37.199" style="s2">legal principle by which settled law is</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.560" end="01:10:40.320" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.199" end="01:10:43.239" style="s2">revisited by the court that</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.320" end="01:10:44.800" style="s2">you could find somebody who was</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.239" end="01:10:47.360" style="s2">satisfactory</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.800" end="01:10:48.960" style="s2">and unimpeachable and that were the</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.360" end="01:10:52.159" style="s2">president to do that</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.960" end="01:10:53.360" style="s2">um it would a put the democrats in a</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.159" end="01:10:56.159" style="s2">very interesting spot</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.360" end="01:10:56.719" style="s2">and b uh probably be the right thing for</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.159" end="01:11:00.719" style="s2">the nation</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.719" end="01:11:00.719" style="s2">yup no i think that&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.800" end="01:11:04.080" style="s2">i think that&#39;s possible it is it is</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.280" end="01:11:06.880" style="s2">complicated</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.080" end="01:11:08.960" style="s2">allow me to just say um zach if you</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.880" end="01:11:10.480" style="s2">would show this for a moment that i</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.960" end="01:11:12.000" style="s2">since we probably triggered a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.480" end="01:11:12.880" style="s2">people with a discussion of abortion at</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.000" end="01:11:15.120" style="s2">all</p>
