<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:01.920" style="s2">Just to define some terms:</p>
<p begin="00:00:01.920" end="00:00:08.420" style="s2">I would describe fulfillment as &quot;a state of having your set of basic human needs met.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.420" end="00:00:13.200" style="s2">Creativity, conviviality and physical health, nutrition, sexuality,</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.200" end="00:00:18.520" style="s2">if you don&#39;t get them you don&#39;t survive very well, and so, if we don&#39;t have them we feel some sort of agitation,</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.520" end="00:00:21.000" style="s2">and if we do have them we feel fulfilled. </p>
<p begin="00:00:21.000" end="00:00:24.920" style="s2">Then I would define a next term, which is well-being.</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.920" end="00:00:33.500" style="s2">And well-being is &quot;both the sense and the reality of being able to achieve fulfillment in a consistent sustainable way.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.500" end="00:00:37.060" style="s2">Well-being is what we are actually trying to accomplish.</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.380" end="00:00:43.940" style="s2">What we mean by jobs, I believe, and this is not perfect but it&#39;s good enough to work with, is: </p>
<p begin="00:00:43.940" end="00:00:52.340" style="s2">&quot;The system that we use to provision individual well-being, in a fashion that is generative of collective well-being.&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:00:52.340" end="00:01:01.260" style="s2">Now, to make that concrete, it&#39;s: &quot;I work to be able to get the things that I think I need to be able to live well.</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.380" end="00:01:10.460" style="s2">By so doing, I contribute my skills and energy to some collective, from which you are able to draw, for your particular individual wellbeing, </p>
<p begin="00:01:10.460" end="00:01:14.580" style="s2">provided that you also contribute your skills back to this commons.</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.580" end="00:01:18.360" style="s2">That&#39;s what we&#39;re trying - that&#39;s what this sub-function is.</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.360" end="00:01:28.820" style="s2">Now, somewhere around the 1600&#39;s, we hit upon an approach to try and do a good job of that. And it worked really well.</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.820" end="00:01:35.803" style="s2">So the neo-liberal capitalist system in fact substantially increased the well-being of people around the world, compared to where it was before.</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.803" end="00:01:41.738" style="s2">The notion that there, what is it - &quot;There is no better system?&quot; That was probably true. I don&#39;t know but it probably was true.</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.738" end="00:01:43.298" style="s2">That&#39;s no longer the case.</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.298" end="00:01:49.348" style="s2">So we no longer are in a circumstance where we have to use a system that we know is designed to create winners and losers,</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.348" end="00:01:55.588" style="s2">because we are in a circumstance where simultaneously we can create a system where there are no losers, and we must.</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.588" end="00:02:04.580" style="s2">The constant process of competition, and development and struggle that was implicit in the genius of the previous system has led us to where we are right now.</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.580" end="00:02:10.743" style="s2">That doesn&#39;t work anymore. There&#39;s lots of good reasons to explain why it can&#39;t possibly work anymore,</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.743" end="00:02:19.160" style="s2">I&#39;ll reference a gentleman named Joseph Tainter and &#39;The Collapse of Complex Societies&#39; as a categorical explanation for precisely why it can&#39;t work anymore.</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.160" end="00:02:28.500" style="s2">But we can be more simple: Our system has provided a western standard of living for about 40 percent of the population,</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.500" end="00:02:32.596" style="s2">the other 60 percent of the population is living on around a dollar a day.</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.596" end="00:02:36.876" style="s2">So, if they want to move up to even ten dollars a day, guess what happens to all of our ecosystems?</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.880" end="00:02:41.260" style="s2">So we can draw lots of reasons why the current way of doing things can&#39;t continue.</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.260" end="00:02:48.580" style="s2">Ok, so let&#39;s deconstruct that. What are we trying to accomplish? Well, as we discussed with jobs, what we are trying to accomplish is:</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.580" end="00:02:54.540" style="s2">&quot;Some system, whereby we can provision individual well-being in a fashion which is generative of our collective well-being.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.540" end="00:03:02.120" style="s2">So that you can figure out a way to live the best life that you can while simultaneously not inhibiting my ability to do that, or anybody else&#39;s ability to do that. </p>
<p begin="00:03:02.120" end="00:03:05.860" style="s2">In fact ideally, in a way that causes us all to level up.</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.220" end="00:03:14.780" style="s2">The short answer is to take into account some really powerful fundamental of what happened in the late sixties and early seventies.</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.780" end="00:03:30.420" style="s2">Up from the beginning of life, up until the 1960s and 70s, the primary problem was the extraction and distribution of fundamentally scarce or fundamentally rivalrous, depletable goods. </p>
<p begin="00:03:30.420" end="00:03:35.875" style="s2">The kinds of things that, if I have them, you can&#39;t have them. And if I&#39;ve used them, they are gone forever.</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.875" end="00:03:40.435" style="s2">So we know that information is the sort of thing that is not rivalrous in nature.</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.435" end="00:03:45.995" style="s2">Once I&#39;ve invented Calculus, I can just give you Calculus and you basically get it for free, and then you can build something on top of it.</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.995" end="00:03:49.625" style="s2">So you get this &quot;Whooahhh!&quot; What we&#39;ve seen in the past hundred years.</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.625" end="00:03:53.785" style="s2">I can make it try to seem rivalrous by using patent and copyright, </p>
<p begin="00:03:53.785" end="00:04:01.160" style="s2">the reason why we treat information as a rivalrous good is because we have an economic and legal model that can deal with rivalrous goods, that can&#39;t deal with non-rivalrous goods.</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.160" end="00:04:18.820" style="s2">What we&#39;re seeing is that there is clearly a generalized move within the existing economy towards organizational structures that are more &#39;affordant&#39; to non-rivalrous generativity. </p>
<p begin="00:04:18.820" end="00:04:25.080" style="s2">The movement from the industrial machine model, where laborers engaged in mindless, repetitive tasks, </p>
<p begin="00:04:25.080" end="00:04:35.720" style="s2">all the way through, say, Hewlett Packard, Yahoo, to Google, is in fact a movement of the progressive discovery of the productivity,</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.720" end="00:04:42.760" style="s2">of increasingly creating things that are in alignment with non-rivalrous techniques.</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.760" end="00:04:46.736" style="s2">The old model was one that had winners and losers. I call this the carrot-and-stick model.</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.740" end="00:04:55.560" style="s2">The carrot-and-stick model is: &quot;If you play the game well, and you give the best value, put all your work into it, then you&#39;ll get rewarded heavily.</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.560" end="00:04:59.000" style="s2">And if you don&#39;t, you&#39;ll get punished.&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:04:59.000" end="00:05:05.236" style="s2">Now, in a timeframe where we didn&#39;t actually have enough rivalrous goods to go around, so somebody was going to go without,</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.236" end="00:05:11.490" style="s2">then, that was both a necessity - who was going to go without? &quot;Well, at least we will pick the ones who didn&#39;t contribute the most.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.490" end="00:05:14.570" style="s2">Ideally, obviously it never actually worked that way.</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.570" end="00:05:20.990" style="s2">And also, it turns out that if I punish you for not contributing and reward you for contributing, I get more contributions so more of us get more stuff.</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.990" end="00:05:22.350" style="s2">That&#39;s the old model.</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.350" end="00:05:33.300" style="s2">It turns out that that model is actually inhibitory to the kinds of things that are non-rivalrous. So creativity isn&#39;t just not motivated by carrots and sticks,</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.300" end="00:05:35.100" style="s2">it&#39;s actually destroyed by carrots and sticks. </p>
<p begin="00:05:35.100" end="00:05:40.760" style="s2">The things that enable creativity are mastery, meaning and autonomy:</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.760" end="00:05:46.561" style="s2">Provision circumstances in such a way that you have the capacity to achieve autonomy, mastery and a sense of meaning.</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.561" end="00:05:50.106" style="s2">Which is going to be personal and collective, because that is the way that human beings are wired.</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.106" end="00:05:55.686" style="s2">Now if that is the case, what we see is that is in fact optimal for generating non-rivalrous goods.</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.686" end="00:06:00.234" style="s2">Now this is very optimistic, because what that means is that things are starting to get into alignment.</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.240" end="00:06:09.100" style="s2">The things that are necessary for human beings to achieve fulfillment turn out to be precisely the sorts of things that maximize our generation of non-rivalrous phenomena.</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.231" end="00:06:14.151" style="s2">It turns out that they also maximize our ability to coordinate with each other.</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.151" end="00:06:18.754" style="s2">Coordinating with each other generates an increase in the production of non-rivalrous phenomena.</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.760" end="00:06:24.960" style="s2">We know that non-rivalrous phenomena have this exponential growth rate, and that each time we get a level up,</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.960" end="00:06:30.745" style="s2">we dramatically increase our capacity to provision the rivalrous goods that are at the bottom of Maslow&#39;s hierarchy. </p>
<p begin="00:06:30.745" end="00:06:36.516" style="s2">So we get this nice feedback loop, that if we shift into increasingly non-rivalrous modes,</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.520" end="00:06:44.220" style="s2">we get increasing escape velocity, where we are constantly rewarded for getting better and better at detaching ourselves from a commoditized environment,</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.220" end="00:06:48.620" style="s2">and better and better at attaching ourselves to a well-being economy.</p>
