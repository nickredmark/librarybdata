<p begin="00:00:01.909" end="00:00:06.359" style="s2">announcement about our online course</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.290" end="00:00:08.220" style="s2">which is called sense-making 101 and</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.359" end="00:00:10.950" style="s2">we&#39;re really excited because we have a</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.220" end="00:00:13.559" style="s2">really great faculty on board to help us</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.950" end="00:00:14.910" style="s2">teach the course and so yeah you want to</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.559" end="00:00:17.550" style="s2">talk more about what people are going to</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.910" end="00:00:19.170" style="s2">learn on since making 101 so we&#39;ve put a</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.550" end="00:00:21.300" style="s2">lot of time and thought into designing</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.170" end="00:00:23.400" style="s2">this course and probably the easiest way</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.300" end="00:00:25.859" style="s2">to describe it is that it moves from the</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.400" end="00:00:27.960" style="s2">inside out so the more we&#39;ve explored</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.859" end="00:00:29.820" style="s2">concepts like sense making or collective</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.960" end="00:00:32.309" style="s2">intelligence on the channel the more</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.820" end="00:00:34.410" style="s2">it&#39;s become clear that in order for that</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.309" end="00:00:36.180" style="s2">to happen in order for us to have you</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.410" end="00:00:38.219" style="s2">know emergent conversations or</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.180" end="00:00:39.899" style="s2">conversations that go somewhere that we</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.219" end="00:00:41.850" style="s2">might not be expecting there&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.899" end="00:00:43.260" style="s2">a toolkit of skills we need yeah and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.850" end="00:00:45.629" style="s2">think it&#39;s important to say that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.260" end="00:00:48.149" style="s2">been running retreats together like we</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.629" end="00:00:49.469" style="s2">both trained as as counselors a couple</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.149" end="00:00:50.969" style="s2">of years ago we&#39;ve been running retreat</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.469" end="00:00:52.289" style="s2">together mainly men&#39;s retreats this is</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.969" end="00:00:55.079" style="s2">not going to be a men only course it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.289" end="00:00:56.520" style="s2">gonna be a mixed course and so we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.079" end="00:00:58.230" style="s2">some experience with doing that in real</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.520" end="00:01:01.289" style="s2">life and now we&#39;re trying to bring it a</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.230" end="00:01:02.879" style="s2">bit more into the ideas that we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.289" end="00:01:05.549" style="s2">on the channel and then into the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.879" end="00:01:07.280" style="s2">the wider online community and but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.549" end="00:01:09.570" style="s2">not doing it alone we&#39;ve got an amazing</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.280" end="00:01:11.369" style="s2">faculty who were gonna be helping us out</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.570" end="00:01:12.720" style="s2">with it as well and we wanted to play</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.369" end="00:01:14.189" style="s2">some clips from each of them to give it</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.720" end="00:01:15.900" style="s2">a bit more of a sense of what they&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.189" end="00:01:17.970" style="s2">delivering on the course so we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.900" end="00:01:19.920" style="s2">start with someone a lot of people might</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.970" end="00:01:25.490" style="s2">be familiar with daniel trachtenberg our</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.920" end="00:01:28.799" style="s2">earnestness and sincerity empowered by</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.490" end="00:01:32.460" style="s2">really deep courage and a deep kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.799" end="00:01:34.560" style="s2">epistemic humility is going to make</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.460" end="00:01:39.270" style="s2">someone misfit for every end group</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.560" end="00:01:40.650" style="s2">currently which is the valley crossing</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.270" end="00:01:42.840" style="s2">that people have to go through to</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.650" end="00:01:45.600" style="s2">basically leave the forces that are</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.840" end="00:01:49.380" style="s2">irate arrayed in a war that we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.600" end="00:01:51.450" style="s2">sides are wronged to hopefully have</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.380" end="00:01:53.820" style="s2">enough people who do that that start to</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.450" end="00:01:57.270" style="s2">find each other and don&#39;t do a new</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.820" end="00:02:01.229" style="s2">tribal groupthink thing but all engage</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.270" end="00:02:03.390" style="s2">in earnest actual thinking themselves an</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.229" end="00:02:04.290" style="s2">actual conversation without orienting</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.390" end="00:02:06.899" style="s2">towards groupthink</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.290" end="00:02:08.819" style="s2">that can start to make a new strange</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.899" end="00:02:10.319" style="s2">attractor so another favorite the</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.819" end="00:02:12.390" style="s2">channel is Jon bovi key he&#39;s become a</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.319" end="00:02:13.030" style="s2">kind of bit of a cult hit online with</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.390" end="00:02:15.040" style="s2">his</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.030" end="00:02:16.990" style="s2">awakening from the meaning crisis series</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.040" end="00:02:19.330" style="s2">and I went out recently and spend a bit</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.990" end="00:02:20.470" style="s2">of time with him in Toronto and recorded</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.330" end="00:02:22.420" style="s2">this field that we&#39;ll be going out in</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.470" end="00:02:24.490" style="s2">the next couple of days where he talks</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.420" end="00:02:26.410" style="s2">about and this is what is me talking</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.490" end="00:02:29.590" style="s2">about in the course is wisdom what is</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.410" end="00:02:31.360" style="s2">wisdom and how do we embody it because</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.590" end="00:02:32.530" style="s2">it&#39;s much more than just a cognitive or</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.360" end="00:02:34.660" style="s2">an ideas based thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.530" end="00:02:36.100" style="s2">what is self-deception what are higher</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.660" end="00:02:38.230" style="s2">states of consciousness what is</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.100" end="00:02:40.840" style="s2">enlightenment what is wisdom what&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.230" end="00:02:44.500" style="s2">best cognitive scientific answer that</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.840" end="00:02:46.030" style="s2">and then can we use that to create what</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.500" end="00:02:48.640" style="s2">I call psycho technologies and</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.030" end="00:02:52.239" style="s2">communities and ecologies of them that</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.640" end="00:02:54.430" style="s2">can give us back the cultivation of</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.239" end="00:02:57.420" style="s2">wisdom and self transcendence and also</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.430" end="00:03:00.790" style="s2">connect us up to a world of you that</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.420" end="00:03:03.910" style="s2">valorizes homes legitimates and make</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.790" end="00:03:06.010" style="s2">sense of that set of practices so we</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.910" end="00:03:07.480" style="s2">also have Diane musho Hamilton who&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.010" end="00:03:09.550" style="s2">award-winning mediator and also a</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.480" end="00:03:11.230" style="s2">meditation instructor and Diane has a</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.550" end="00:03:13.180" style="s2">lot of expertise around the area of</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.230" end="00:03:15.220" style="s2">collective intelligence and in this clip</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.180" end="00:03:17.230" style="s2">she&#39;s talking about this other aspect</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.220" end="00:03:20.049" style="s2">that&#39;s quite closely related to it which</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.230" end="00:03:21.940" style="s2">is coherence and about how this process</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.049" end="00:03:23.200" style="s2">of being in and out of coherence and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.940" end="00:03:24.760" style="s2">difference between coherence and</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.200" end="00:03:27.250" style="s2">difference is really essential for</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.760" end="00:03:29.709" style="s2">collective intelligence my experiences</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.250" end="00:03:33.100" style="s2">create a lot of coherence and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.709" end="00:03:35.500" style="s2">heightened difference boom and then you</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.100" end="00:03:37.209" style="s2">start to experience emergence and how to</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.500" end="00:03:38.739" style="s2">heighten difference is the skillset</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.209" end="00:03:40.329" style="s2">we&#39;re always trying to move everybody</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.739" end="00:03:43.150" style="s2">towards sameness and we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.329" end="00:03:44.950" style="s2">move everybody towards coherence but</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.150" end="00:03:47.920" style="s2">actually what we need to be doing is</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.950" end="00:03:50.320" style="s2">helping people calibrate and move</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.920" end="00:03:52.420" style="s2">together highly coherently and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.320" end="00:03:55.120" style="s2">really experience difference as it</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.420" end="00:03:58.150" style="s2">arises on an embodied level within the</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.120" end="00:04:00.640" style="s2">interaction notice when it flips into</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.150" end="00:04:02.829" style="s2">threat and try to calibrate difference</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.640" end="00:04:04.359" style="s2">and teach people how to be in difference</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.829" end="00:04:06.940" style="s2">because that&#39;s where emergence is more</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.359" end="00:04:08.799" style="s2">likely to to really make itself to</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.940" end="00:04:11.170" style="s2">really come forward as to this collision</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.799" end="00:04:12.910" style="s2">of difference that&#39;s what happens and</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.170" end="00:04:14.859" style="s2">then we also have dough Xin Roshi</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.910" end="00:04:16.989" style="s2">who is delivering a session on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.859" end="00:04:18.940" style="s2">shadow which is a really core concept</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.989" end="00:04:20.709" style="s2">and one he&#39;s really an expert in fact</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.940" end="00:04:23.020" style="s2">he&#39;s known as the the shadow Roshi so</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.709" end="00:04:25.630" style="s2">play clip from him we have to have</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.020" end="00:04:28.479" style="s2">collective ways of dealing with this</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.630" end="00:04:31.449" style="s2">collective shadow and we&#39;ve developed</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.479" end="00:04:33.880" style="s2">some some collective shadow work some</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.449" end="00:04:37.120" style="s2">group shadow work where we we really</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.880" end="00:04:39.699" style="s2">talk about these shadows and we work on</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.120" end="00:04:41.349" style="s2">them and we help people become conscious</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.699" end="00:04:43.030" style="s2">of them so we thought long and hard</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.349" end="00:04:45.310" style="s2">about how to structure the course in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.030" end="00:04:47.319" style="s2">best way and what we&#39;re gonna deliver is</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.310" end="00:04:50.410" style="s2">an eight-week process and it&#39;s really a</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.319" end="00:04:52.750" style="s2">mix of working together so working in</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.410" end="00:04:55.750" style="s2">small groups having sessions with a live</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.750" end="00:04:58.659" style="s2">lesson and QA with the teacher also</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.750" end="00:05:00.310" style="s2">access anytime you want to exclusive</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.659" end="00:05:02.229" style="s2">interviews we&#39;ve recorded with them and</p>
