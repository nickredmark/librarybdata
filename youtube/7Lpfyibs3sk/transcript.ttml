<p begin="00:03:37.519" end="00:03:41.840" style="s2">flavors and then you add something and</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.440" end="00:03:45.680" style="s2">all those flavors take another direction</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.840" end="00:03:47.390" style="s2">another they feel differently you know a</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.680" end="00:03:50.150" style="s2">good way to look at it may because then</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.390" end="00:03:53.780" style="s2">we&#39;re not thinking in terms of without a</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.150" end="00:03:55.730" style="s2">continuity because there is always a</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.780" end="00:03:57.560" style="s2">continuity isn&#39;t there between what the</p>

<p begin="00:04:03.050" end="00:04:10.280" style="s2">great there&#39;s no way to get the trauma</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.950" end="00:04:12.110" style="s2">of the last several decades out of the</p>

<p begin="00:04:12.110" end="00:04:19.220" style="s2">destroyed by it there&#39;s no way to get</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.250" end="00:04:22.770" style="s2">the suspicions and the the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.220" end="00:04:25.160" style="s2">experience of luxury and come</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.770" end="00:04:28.350" style="s2">that has been the product of so much</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.160" end="00:04:30.510" style="s2">exploitation out of those aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.350" end="00:04:33.630" style="s2">those groupings of people in the culture</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.510" end="00:04:37.020" style="s2">who have benefited from it hmm</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.630" end="00:04:38.940" style="s2">right so it&#39;s about I mean for me this</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.020" end="00:04:40.430" style="s2">came really clear when we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.940" end="00:04:44.040" style="s2">about gender questions</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.430" end="00:04:47.670" style="s2">uh-huh if only we could change this</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.040" end="00:04:48.570" style="s2">genders behavior well hold on a second</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.670" end="00:04:52.410" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.570" end="00:04:54.810" style="s2">you know how do we even get how does one</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.410" end="00:04:58.140" style="s2">begin to find the beginning in the end</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.810" end="00:05:00.390" style="s2">of that right again that&#39;s complexity</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.140" end="00:05:03.270" style="s2">isn&#39;t it just just because gender is is</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.390" end="00:05:07.020" style="s2">so complex and it&#39;s not just one thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.270" end="00:05:08.730" style="s2">right that&#39;s what I was wanting to ask</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.020" end="00:05:10.470" style="s2">you about that actually that was one of</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.730" end="00:05:11.820" style="s2">my the things I wanted to ask you about</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.470" end="00:05:16.830" style="s2">it because I thought you might have a</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.820" end="00:05:21.480" style="s2">nuanced answer because a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.830" end="00:05:22.890" style="s2">are talking about how you know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.480" end="00:05:24.960" style="s2">talking about some kind of paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.890" end="00:05:28.380" style="s2">change and and it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.960" end="00:05:31.650" style="s2">shift and gender and of some kind or and</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.380" end="00:05:34.140" style="s2">also you&#39;re a woman and and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.650" end="00:05:37.710" style="s2">lot more male voices out there hmm</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.140" end="00:05:38.820" style="s2">so so yeah can you can you elaborate a</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.710" end="00:05:41.600" style="s2">little bit can you speak a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.820" end="00:05:45.150" style="s2">about that what what you mean by that</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.600" end="00:05:47.760" style="s2">yeah I am I wrote this paper about it</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.150" end="00:05:55.470" style="s2">for MIT and it&#39;s called I want you to</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.760" end="00:05:57.690" style="s2">want me to want you and it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.470" end="00:05:59.820" style="s2">looking at sort of the trends contextual</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.690" end="00:06:04.110" style="s2">processes there that this is cultural</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.820" end="00:06:06.210" style="s2">this is economic this is this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.110" end="00:06:08.190" style="s2">in the education system this is has</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.210" end="00:06:10.740" style="s2">everything to do with intergenerational</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.190" end="00:06:13.830" style="s2">learning this is in the media it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.740" end="00:06:17.850" style="s2">technology it&#39;s in our whole formation</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.830" end="00:06:20.160" style="s2">of identity and it&#39;s at the level even</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.850" end="00:06:23.990" style="s2">of physiology so when you mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.160" end="00:06:26.490" style="s2">Jimmy in gender roles or gender</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.990" end="00:06:29.700" style="s2">conundrum let&#39;s put it that way the</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.490" end="00:06:33.360" style="s2">gender pain the gender brokenness the</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.700" end="00:06:35.050" style="s2">gender possibilities hmm right all of</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.360" end="00:06:37.449" style="s2">that stuff is</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.050" end="00:06:42.520" style="s2">deep in the complexity of the situation</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.449" end="00:06:45.520" style="s2">and it&#39;s just the same thinking that got</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.520" end="00:06:47.470" style="s2">us into this mess that says what we have</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.520" end="00:06:50.050" style="s2">to do is make the following adjustments</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.470" end="00:06:55.120" style="s2">in this department or that department</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.050" end="00:07:00.370" style="s2">and I guess my feeling is that you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.120" end="00:07:02.440" style="s2">when I think about even like I was just</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.370" end="00:07:05.199" style="s2">about to say it&#39;s even physiological so</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.440" end="00:07:07.800" style="s2">you know what what turns you on like</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.199" end="00:07:11.259" style="s2">what makes your body respond</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.800" end="00:07:14.699" style="s2">that&#39;s ideas that&#39;s experience that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.259" end="00:07:21.030" style="s2">narratives that&#39;s mythologies that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.699" end="00:07:27.250" style="s2">generations of stuff there what is sexy</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.030" end="00:07:30.879" style="s2">so it&#39;s a wild reductionism to think we</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.250" end="00:07:34.360" style="s2">can just so that it&#39;s possible to fix</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.879" end="00:07:36.610" style="s2">this in in one spot or another but</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.360" end="00:07:40.930" style="s2">rather I think it&#39;s maybe a better</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.610" end="00:07:43.270" style="s2">approach to just pause and not be</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.930" end="00:07:46.779" style="s2">looking for a solution not be looking</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.270" end="00:07:49.060" style="s2">for definitions of what men and women</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.779" end="00:07:51.009" style="s2">are like strict definitions is that what</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.060" end="00:07:54.219" style="s2">you mean and and not be looking for the</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.009" end="00:07:57.729" style="s2">new rules of the game right so if the</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.219" end="00:08:00.479" style="s2">rules of the seduction game are and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.729" end="00:08:03.819" style="s2">seduction habits and cultures and</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.479" end="00:08:05.590" style="s2">expectations are have led us down</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.819" end="00:08:08.020" style="s2">because I think they&#39;ve let everybody</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.590" end="00:08:09.460" style="s2">down personally I think that men have</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.020" end="00:08:13.419" style="s2">suffered a great deal women have</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.460" end="00:08:15.849" style="s2">suffered a great deal people who are in</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.419" end="00:08:18.219" style="s2">genders that are in between there or who</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.849" end="00:08:20.919" style="s2">have you know experienced that in other</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.219" end="00:08:26.529" style="s2">forms of their sexuality this this</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.919" end="00:08:28.479" style="s2">modality has been painful as a painful</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.529" end="00:08:31.960" style="s2">history in which people in all</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.479" end="00:08:35.919" style="s2">directions have been badly hurt mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.960" end="00:08:37.209" style="s2">so so what&#39;s the pain you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.919" end="00:08:39.070" style="s2">there&#39;s two things I&#39;m getting here the</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.209" end="00:08:42.699" style="s2">pain and then the possibility you talk</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.070" end="00:08:45.040" style="s2">to these second possibility so so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.699" end="00:08:47.900" style="s2">the pain is a little bit more it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.040" end="00:08:50.930" style="s2">discussed more maybe not</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.900" end="00:08:52.460" style="s2">but but I&#39;d also like to hear about the</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.930" end="00:08:56.180" style="s2">possibility what you think the</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.460" end="00:09:00.410" style="s2">possibility for let&#39;s say let&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.180" end="00:09:02.390" style="s2">healthy mode of gender relations or is</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.410" end="00:09:04.760" style="s2">that what we&#39;re talking about I I guess</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.390" end="00:09:06.860" style="s2">for me that health is you know and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.760" end="00:09:10.250" style="s2">think this actually really ties into the</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.860" end="00:09:15.440" style="s2">whole question around paradigm shift but</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.250" end="00:09:19.490" style="s2">it has to do with complexity and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.440" end="00:09:24.050" style="s2">recognition of each person&#39;s complexity</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.490" end="00:09:30.500" style="s2">yeah and you know I what is a healthy</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.050" end="00:09:33.200" style="s2">sexual or or romantic or affectionate</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.500" end="00:09:37.550" style="s2">relationship between two people well</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.200" end="00:09:39.920" style="s2">that depends on the two people mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.550" end="00:09:42.650" style="s2">and it depends on the way that they</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.920" end="00:09:44.330" style="s2">bring out various things in each other</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.650" end="00:09:46.310" style="s2">and how they&#39;re dealing with their</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.330" end="00:09:51.790" style="s2">culture and how they&#39;re dealing with the</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.310" end="00:09:55.040" style="s2">ideas that they came into and so so I</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.790" end="00:09:57.530" style="s2">mean it kinda there are big questions in</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.040" end="00:09:59.570" style="s2">there like is someone gonna get hurt is</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.530" end="00:10:03.770" style="s2">there room for exploration</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.570" end="00:10:05.660" style="s2">how much context is there is there you</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.770" end="00:10:07.970" style="s2">know there&#39;s all sorts of stuff in there</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.660" end="00:10:10.280" style="s2">but ultimately I think that&#39;s where the</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.970" end="00:10:12.260" style="s2">possibility is and I would say the same</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.280" end="00:10:16.160" style="s2">thing right now for where we are in</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.260" end="00:10:19.610" style="s2">terms of this liminal moment between you</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.160" end="00:10:25.850" style="s2">know pre kovat 19 and postcode with 19</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.610" end="00:10:32.240" style="s2">then this is a moment where we go beyond</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.850" end="00:10:34.130" style="s2">that stupid lifeboat metaphor mmm stupid</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.240" end="00:10:36.140" style="s2">lifeboat metaphor you know the stupid</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.130" end="00:10:38.000" style="s2">lifeboat metaphor that says well you</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.140" end="00:10:41.750" style="s2">have to do it like this or you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.000" end="00:10:43.730" style="s2">break the system right I only fit 17</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.750" end="00:10:47.110" style="s2">people on the boat and there&#39;s 32 in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.730" end="00:10:49.610" style="s2">water so clearly 17 of them have to die</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.110" end="00:10:51.290" style="s2">right which is what happens when you</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.610" end="00:10:54.260" style="s2">think about this stuff at the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.290" end="00:10:55.610" style="s2">level you end up with questions that</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.260" end="00:10:57.740" style="s2">sound like that</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.610" end="00:10:59.430" style="s2">that&#39;s called data right as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.740" end="00:11:02.940" style="s2">warm data like May</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.430" end="00:11:06.570" style="s2">about warm data and yeah and the data</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.940" end="00:11:09.510" style="s2">would be like okay which 17 people are</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.570" end="00:11:11.730" style="s2">really good swimmers which ones have</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.510" end="00:11:13.680" style="s2">clothes that are extra that can be tied</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.730" end="00:11:17.130" style="s2">together to help pull people in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.680" end="00:11:19.050" style="s2">water who lose but knowledge of you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.130" end="00:11:21.810" style="s2">where we&#39;re going who&#39;s got right so</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.050" end="00:11:24.209" style="s2">there&#39;s all kinds of questions that have</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.810" end="00:11:28.680" style="s2">to do with the complexity of each of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.209" end="00:11:32.130" style="s2">17 persons mm-hmm that&#39;s may not even</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.680" end="00:11:36.649" style="s2">say people let&#39;s say persons mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.130" end="00:11:40.620" style="s2">because this person is a unique costume</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.649" end="00:11:43.410" style="s2">yeah and and those are like just</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.620" end="00:11:48.930" style="s2">possible possibility vectors where</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.410" end="00:11:52.529" style="s2">possibility vectors so that&#39;s I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.930" end="00:11:55.680" style="s2">where I&#39;m going with all of this is into</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.529" end="00:12:01.800" style="s2">those those details and kind of out of</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.680" end="00:12:04.680" style="s2">the the sweeping calculations mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.800" end="00:12:07.230" style="s2">okay yeah because what about like</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.680" end="00:12:09.779" style="s2">primordial let&#39;s say I know we have a</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.230" end="00:12:12.570" style="s2">probably stereotypical idea of that</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.779" end="00:12:14.459" style="s2">primordial roles because I think that</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.570" end="00:12:17.480" style="s2">for example I think that you know we had</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.459" end="00:12:21.660" style="s2">a very polarized view of male and female</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.480" end="00:12:23.279" style="s2">you know in in an industrial society you</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.660" end="00:12:24.959" style="s2">know and then we move into</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.279" end="00:12:26.790" style="s2">post-modernism which just flattens</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.959" end="00:12:28.860" style="s2">everything and then there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.790" end="00:12:31.770" style="s2">definition there&#39;s no contour there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.860" end="00:12:33.390" style="s2">we&#39;re just all the same and then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.770" end="00:12:35.940" style="s2">moving out into some other thing where</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.390" end="00:12:38.400" style="s2">we want to have a more complex idea of</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.940" end="00:12:40.800" style="s2">what male and female is perhaps but we</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.400" end="00:12:43.860" style="s2">also want to recover let&#39;s say some of</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.800" end="00:12:46.070" style="s2">the primordial qualities of that would</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.860" end="00:12:48.380" style="s2">you agree with what I&#39;m saying or I</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.070" end="00:12:54.420" style="s2">actually don&#39;t know what to do with that</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.380" end="00:12:57.990" style="s2">because my experience says this I wake</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.420" end="00:13:00.000" style="s2">up in the morning with my partner and we</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.990" end="00:13:04.079" style="s2">try to figure out how to get through the</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.000" end="00:13:07.290" style="s2">day as best we can mm-hmm right and that</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.079" end="00:13:09.900" style="s2">means that in every aspect of the day in</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.290" end="00:13:12.089" style="s2">some way or another we are having to go</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.900" end="00:13:13.150" style="s2">beyond roles beyond the roles the</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.089" end="00:13:15.960" style="s2">culture has to</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.150" end="00:13:25.480" style="s2">beyond the rules some of the biology has</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.960" end="00:13:27.130" style="s2">has maybe produced so we what are we</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.480" end="00:13:30.610" style="s2">doing we&#39;re in the culture that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.130" end="00:13:33.490" style="s2">completely dysfunctional that&#39;s premise</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.610" end="00:13:36.070" style="s2">on exploitation and extraction and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.490" end="00:13:37.660" style="s2">filled with all kinds of messaging that</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.070" end="00:13:41.110" style="s2">leads to messaging that leads to</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.660" end="00:13:43.000" style="s2">messaging around like I was saying even</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.110" end="00:13:44.530" style="s2">our identities what is a what is a</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.000" end="00:13:47.050" style="s2">success what does it mean to be a</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.530" end="00:13:51.700" style="s2">success mm-hmm what does it mean to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.050" end="00:14:05.260" style="s2">sexy what does it mean to be kind what</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.700" end="00:14:08.050" style="s2">does it mean to be important so all of</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.260" end="00:14:10.900" style="s2">those questions come into what these</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.050" end="00:14:13.180" style="s2">roles and these assumptions and even our</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.900" end="00:14:18.160" style="s2">physiological responses to what is</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.180" end="00:14:21.070" style="s2">attractive right and so but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.160" end="00:14:26.860" style="s2">theirs they&#39;ve been cooking in the soup</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.070" end="00:14:30.520" style="s2">of a really screwed up culture yeah stew</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.860" end="00:14:32.920" style="s2">for a long time and so I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.520" end="00:14:38.140" style="s2">hesitant to lean back into that because</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.920" end="00:14:41.890" style="s2">I in my experience who it&#39;s possible for</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.140" end="00:14:46.330" style="s2">me to be changes depending on who I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.890" end="00:14:48.790" style="s2">with sure it&#39;s a relational process and</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.330" end="00:14:51.330" style="s2">so the more attentive I am to those</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.790" end="00:14:54.940" style="s2">relational processes the more</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.330" end="00:14:56.950" style="s2">possibility I have to perceive instead</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.940" end="00:15:02.140" style="s2">of thinking oh well this is just how it</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.950" end="00:15:05.560" style="s2">is right and I am very leery of notions</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.140" end="00:15:09.340" style="s2">of human nature because those notions</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.560" end="00:15:15.630" style="s2">are produced by humans and so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.340" end="00:15:18.490" style="s2">there&#39;s a trap there&#39;s a trap there hmm</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.630" end="00:15:21.870" style="s2">so let&#39;s say I was I was I was watching</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.490" end="00:15:25.830" style="s2">your film about about your father and</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.870" end="00:15:29.190" style="s2">and he went to study</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.830" end="00:15:31.740" style="s2">I guess in Polynesia I can&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.190" end="00:15:34.860" style="s2">the the names of the tribes with with</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.740" end="00:15:36.450" style="s2">Margaret Mead and why when you were</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.860" end="00:15:38.250" style="s2">talking I was just thinking about that</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.450" end="00:15:40.950" style="s2">and I was thinking about how they saw</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.250" end="00:15:43.430" style="s2">like how they saw what a human being is</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.950" end="00:15:45.870" style="s2">and its role and that kind of thing like</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.430" end="00:15:48.930" style="s2">compared to how we see it and and how</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.870" end="00:15:55.020" style="s2">radically different those two views of</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.930" end="00:15:57.420" style="s2">the world are well I think what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.020" end="00:16:01.830" style="s2">you&#39;re poking at here is kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.420" end="00:16:10.200" style="s2">essence of why this is an important</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.830" end="00:16:12.060" style="s2">conversation to have now because I guess</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.200" end="00:16:15.900" style="s2">what happens in that cultural confusion</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.060" end="00:16:18.480" style="s2">or the cultural curiosity or noticing</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.900" end="00:16:21.830" style="s2">that other there are other possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.480" end="00:16:26.010" style="s2">than the ones that have been so</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.830" end="00:16:30.150" style="s2">entrenched and just woven in every</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.010" end="00:16:33.840" style="s2">nuance of our language of it you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.150" end="00:16:36.900" style="s2">all of these these deep ideas they form</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.840" end="00:16:39.960" style="s2">a kind of matrix inside of which it</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.900" end="00:16:42.270" style="s2">becomes impossible to create change</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.960" end="00:16:46.140" style="s2">because the change is informed by the</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.270" end="00:16:48.510" style="s2">matrix that that you&#39;re trying to change</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.140" end="00:16:50.280" style="s2">and so you end up in this question of</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.510" end="00:16:52.080" style="s2">how do we change the system when we are</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.280" end="00:16:55.620" style="s2">the system and we&#39;re inside the system</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.080" end="00:16:58.230" style="s2">and yeah and and you know if three weeks</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.620" end="00:17:01.920" style="s2">ago they were all these issues that were</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.230" end="00:17:04.920" style="s2">absolutely impossible to imagine mmm</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.920" end="00:17:08.060" style="s2">stopping the airplanes what yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.920" end="00:17:10.410" style="s2">people home with their kids actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.060" end="00:17:12.600" style="s2">everybody became a home school that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.410" end="00:17:15.209" style="s2">shock to me and that&#39;s that&#39;s it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.600" end="00:17:17.550" style="s2">been an incredible for me personally</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.209" end="00:17:19.620" style="s2">that that&#39;s that&#39;s been an eye-opener</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.550" end="00:17:21.690" style="s2">it&#39;s like I&#39;ve always thought that I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.620" end="00:17:23.880" style="s2">rather homeschool my kids if I had the</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.690" end="00:17:28.110" style="s2">possibility but now I know that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.880" end="00:17:29.790" style="s2">true you know right I&#39;m not saying that</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.110" end="00:17:32.010" style="s2">I think that it should be like that for</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.790" end="00:17:36.000" style="s2">everybody but</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.010" end="00:17:38.070" style="s2">and and now we don&#39;t know that should</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.000" end="00:17:40.560" style="s2">you know that should just cut brackets</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.070" end="00:17:43.920" style="s2">on it and that should didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.560" end="00:17:46.620" style="s2">brackets on it didn&#39;t have quotation</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.920" end="00:17:50.750" style="s2">marks on it it wasn&#39;t in question yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.620" end="00:17:55.640" style="s2">week six weeks ago so that&#39;s a big shift</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.750" end="00:17:58.830" style="s2">huge and we where its radical and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.640" end="00:17:59.880" style="s2">it&#39;s much more radical than the being</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.830" end="00:18:06.090" style="s2">hung with your kids</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.880" end="00:18:07.710" style="s2">it&#39;s the idea yeah yeah you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.090" end="00:18:10.140" style="s2">about possibility and that&#39;s what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.710" end="00:18:11.820" style="s2">talking about this I think this shows</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.140" end="00:18:13.770" style="s2">even though it&#39;s just you know it has</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.820" end="00:18:16.470" style="s2">this terrible other side to it this</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.770" end="00:18:18.090" style="s2">event shows certain possibilities I</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.470" end="00:18:20.220" style="s2">don&#39;t know if these possibilities will</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.090" end="00:18:21.750" style="s2">be manifested and I tend to be kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.220" end="00:18:24.780" style="s2">cynical about whether they will be or</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.750" end="00:18:27.330" style="s2">not but even the idea of them being</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.780" end="00:18:28.520" style="s2">there being a possibility seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.330" end="00:18:31.410" style="s2">extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.520" end="00:18:32.910" style="s2">yeah it is extraordinary and I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.410" end="00:18:38.820" style="s2">when you were talking about Gregory and</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.910" end="00:18:43.550" style="s2">Margaret in New Guinea and Bali it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.820" end="00:18:46.890" style="s2">I think what&#39;s important about that</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.550" end="00:18:50.280" style="s2">experience that Gregory was describing</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.890" end="00:18:56.090" style="s2">there I&#39;m gonna lean more onto his his</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.280" end="00:19:01.230" style="s2">version of that is the way that it</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.090" end="00:19:04.500" style="s2">brought questioning to his own</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.230" end="00:19:06.900" style="s2">epistemological assumptions mmm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.500" end="00:19:09.390" style="s2">right so right it&#39;s not so much about</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.900" end="00:19:12.390" style="s2">forming descriptions of other cultures</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.390" end="00:19:16.560" style="s2">as it is about recognizing that there</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.390" end="00:19:20.040" style="s2">were limits on your own hmm and and</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.560" end="00:19:22.290" style="s2">before one has access to really</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.040" end="00:19:25.110" style="s2">perceiving of their possibilities and</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.290" end="00:19:26.760" style="s2">ways of being it can appear that</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.110" end="00:19:29.730" style="s2">marriage is marriage and money is money</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.760" end="00:19:32.820" style="s2">and time is time and you know age is age</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.730" end="00:19:37.770" style="s2">and woman is woman and man is man and</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.820" end="00:19:39.480" style="s2">that these things are are is is and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.770" end="00:19:42.870" style="s2">when you start to perceive things in</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.480" end="00:19:45.510" style="s2">another culture you realize oh my is is</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.870" end="00:19:48.419" style="s2">different than there is so what it is</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.510" end="00:19:50.910" style="s2">in the word something what is this what</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.419" end="00:19:53.429" style="s2">is this and and that&#39;s an important</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.910" end="00:19:57.380" style="s2">question that&#39;s the moment I think that</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.429" end="00:19:58.530" style="s2">gives us that liminal pause of</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.380" end="00:20:00.480" style="s2">possibility</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.530" end="00:20:01.890" style="s2">yeah I remember he&#39;s saying and saying</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.480" end="00:20:04.110" style="s2">in the film that you think your five</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.890" end="00:20:06.150" style="s2">fingers are fine fingers but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.110" end="00:20:09.090" style="s2">actually the relationship between the</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.150" end="00:20:10.890" style="s2">fingers which is what way more complex</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.090" end="00:20:13.350" style="s2">then let&#39;s say or an image in the mind</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.890" end="00:20:15.210" style="s2">of what fingers are and I guess I guess</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.350" end="00:20:18.090" style="s2">if we&#39;re asleep we tend to think and</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.210" end="00:20:19.830" style="s2">sort of fixed images of things and the</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.090" end="00:20:22.500" style="s2">more we wake up we tend to the more we</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.830" end="00:20:24.540" style="s2">see the living reality we tend to those</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.500" end="00:20:26.910" style="s2">those images kind of dissolve does that</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.540" end="00:20:28.980" style="s2">does that make sense and we we just stop</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.910" end="00:20:32.250" style="s2">seeing the world as in terms of things</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.980" end="00:20:34.140" style="s2">and objects and and I think that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.250" end="00:20:35.820" style="s2">you&#39;re that&#39;s what your whole thing is</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.140" end="00:20:38.280" style="s2">isn&#39;t it about relationships seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.820" end="00:20:40.200" style="s2">world those relationships am I getting</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.280" end="00:20:43.130" style="s2">that right yeah I mean the beauty of</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.200" end="00:20:46.230" style="s2">relationships is they&#39;re not fixed</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.130" end="00:20:48.179" style="s2">mm-hmm right so if we see the world in</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.230" end="00:20:51.770" style="s2">terms of relationships there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.179" end="00:20:56.309" style="s2">more possibility for perceiving</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.770" end="00:20:58.740" style="s2">possibility as opposed to if you</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.309" end="00:21:01.890" style="s2">perceive things and if gender is a thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.740" end="00:21:04.830" style="s2">or culture is a thing or an economy as a</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.890" end="00:21:08.630" style="s2">thing or an I identity is the thing</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.830" end="00:21:11.669" style="s2">instead of looking at each of those as</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.630" end="00:21:13.220" style="s2">nests of relational process all of which</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.669" end="00:21:15.990" style="s2">are changing all the time</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.220" end="00:21:18.960" style="s2">mm-hmm they&#39;re not things there are no</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.990" end="00:21:22.400" style="s2">things there&#39;s no thing right right so</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.960" end="00:21:25.070" style="s2">so you know identity what is identity</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.400" end="00:21:28.950" style="s2">right identity is actually all</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.070" end="00:21:30.780" style="s2">relational mm-hmm so it&#39;s you know your</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.950" end="00:21:32.160" style="s2">relationship to the economy your</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.780" end="00:21:33.540" style="s2">relationship to the culture your</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.160" end="00:21:36.270" style="s2">relationship to your body your</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.540" end="00:21:37.679" style="s2">relationship to your former generations</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.270" end="00:21:40.530" style="s2">your relationship to the future</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.679" end="00:21:43.200" style="s2">generations your relationship to ideas</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.530" end="00:21:46.740" style="s2">your relationship to music your</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.200" end="00:21:48.929" style="s2">relationship to your sexuality whatever</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.740" end="00:21:50.700" style="s2">but it&#39;s all relational and when those</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.929" end="00:21:55.830" style="s2">relationships start changing there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.700" end="00:21:57.990" style="s2">question Oh Who am I mm-hmm right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.830" end="00:21:58.800" style="s2">the question that&#39;s getting poked right</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.990" end="00:22:02.730" style="s2">now that</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.800" end="00:22:05.580" style="s2">scaring a lot of exactly exactly because</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.730" end="00:22:07.200" style="s2">we are forced into looking into that</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.580" end="00:22:10.470" style="s2">question whether we like it or not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.200" end="00:22:15.240" style="s2">almost like the big spiritual question</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.470" end="00:22:19.470" style="s2">has arrived you know it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.240" end="00:22:22.110" style="s2">arrived in a mass or something and it</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.470" end="00:22:24.720" style="s2">arrived from multiple contexts right</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.110" end="00:22:28.290" style="s2">it&#39;s not at one context all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.720" end="00:22:30.450" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s who are you as a dad because</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.290" end="00:22:32.130" style="s2">you&#39;ve got your kid in your face who are</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.450" end="00:22:34.890" style="s2">you in relationship to all this</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.130" end="00:22:37.590" style="s2">technology who are you economically</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.890" end="00:22:40.140" style="s2">who are you culturally who are you in</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.590" end="00:22:42.630" style="s2">your body at your health in your body in</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.140" end="00:22:46.320" style="s2">your age like you know suddenly I am</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.630" end="00:22:48.810" style="s2">realizing that you know you and I we</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.320" end="00:22:51.540" style="s2">have some gray hair yeah yeah we are</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.810" end="00:22:55.260" style="s2">actually in the safe zone anymore</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.540" end="00:22:59.220" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s you know that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.260" end="00:23:04.980" style="s2">question whoo-hoo Who am I who are you</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.220" end="00:23:08.460" style="s2">in in post coded world well you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.980" end="00:23:11.220" style="s2">you&#39;re more vulnerable that&#39;s that&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.460" end="00:23:13.530" style="s2">sure I mean we&#39;re we&#39;re we&#39;re vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.220" end="00:23:18.840" style="s2">I guess especially if we have gray hair</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.530" end="00:23:20.940" style="s2">or and you know there&#39;s a there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.840" end="00:23:22.740" style="s2">of people who have been so vulnerable to</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.940" end="00:23:29.910" style="s2">begin with you are even more vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.740" end="00:23:32.340" style="s2">right right and so that but again it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.910" end="00:23:34.590" style="s2">also I&#39;m sorry to interrupt I also think</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.340" end="00:23:36.690" style="s2">with the vulnerability there comes the</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.590" end="00:23:38.460" style="s2">possibility to observe another kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.690" end="00:23:41.520" style="s2">strength in you at the same time so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.460" end="00:23:44.490" style="s2">again this double-edged yeah I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.520" end="00:23:48.690" style="s2">think the lack of vulnerability is a</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.490" end="00:23:50.010" style="s2">weakness for sure you know the people</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.690" end="00:23:52.560" style="s2">who are running around feeling</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.010" end="00:23:54.330" style="s2">invincible right now they&#39;re not only</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.560" end="00:23:56.550" style="s2">their own weakness but they&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.330" end="00:23:58.890" style="s2">weakness to the whole community they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.550" end="00:24:01.130" style="s2">showing the weakness of the media the</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.890" end="00:24:04.260" style="s2">weakness of science the weakness of</p>

<p begin="00:24:07.140" end="00:24:11.430" style="s2">weakest part of our culture because</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.150" end="00:24:12.640" style="s2">they&#39;re creating weak links with all the</p>

<p begin="00:24:12.640" end="00:24:18.550" style="s2">that gave them that invincible idea</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.470" end="00:24:20.470" style="s2">mm-hmm I am invincible</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.550" end="00:24:22.030" style="s2">I&#39;m not worried I&#39;m not afraid I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.470" end="00:24:24.820" style="s2">gonna get sick and die from this and it</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.030" end="00:24:27.910" style="s2">said well what you have just exposed is</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.820" end="00:24:31.570" style="s2">actually that you don&#39;t see but your</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.910" end="00:24:34.180" style="s2">health is not your own mm-hmm that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.570" end="00:24:35.890" style="s2">profound - yeah that&#39;s if people could</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.180" end="00:24:38.410" style="s2">understand that perhaps that would be</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.890" end="00:24:40.540" style="s2">profound if I could understand that I</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.410" end="00:24:44.290" style="s2">should say people and some preachy kind</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.540" end="00:24:45.760" style="s2">of way of it so because I guess the ego</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.290" end="00:24:47.860" style="s2">feels and you know thinks it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.760" end="00:24:50.020" style="s2">invincible and yet we have we have this</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.860" end="00:24:54.280" style="s2">part of us since on some level that is</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.020" end="00:25:00.280" style="s2">like oh yeah you know it feels it feels</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.280" end="00:25:06.670" style="s2">above the the above nature above reality</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.280" end="00:25:09.580" style="s2">it seems to be a big a big theme it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.670" end="00:25:13.030" style="s2">important theme of being a human being</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.580" end="00:25:15.790" style="s2">in this era where climate crisis is</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.030" end="00:25:18.580" style="s2">looming where there&#39;s all these you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.790" end="00:25:22.330" style="s2">obviously the economic global economic</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.580" end="00:25:24.430" style="s2">system is not cannot be run with the</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.330" end="00:25:27.790" style="s2">level of exploitation and extraction it</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.430" end="00:25:30.310" style="s2">has the education system is you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.790" end="00:25:32.110" style="s2">developed to produce this eco economic</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.310" end="00:25:36.810" style="s2">system the cultures right the whole</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.110" end="00:25:40.060" style="s2">thing is running on this invincible drug</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.810" end="00:25:47.080" style="s2">and it just seems to me that this</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.060" end="00:25:49.650" style="s2">question of actually being being</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.080" end="00:25:49.650" style="s2">vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.920" end="00:25:56.370" style="s2">I don&#39;t just mean emotionally vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.080" end="00:25:58.860" style="s2">I mean physically vulnerable is you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.370" end="00:26:02.460" style="s2">like we could be some of the last</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.860" end="00:26:06.210" style="s2">generations of this version of Homo</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.460" end="00:26:17.400" style="s2">sapiens mm-hmm right so this this is a</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.210" end="00:26:19.620" style="s2">deep shift of of humility that that one</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.400" end="00:26:22.110" style="s2">of the greatest strengths right now is</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.620" end="00:26:25.590" style="s2">the capacity to learn the capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.110" end="00:26:31.440" style="s2">see outside your matrix the capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.590" end="00:26:35.400" style="s2">question the capacity need to pause mm</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.440" end="00:26:38.310" style="s2">hmm hmm the capacity need to to look for</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.400" end="00:26:43.700" style="s2">the complexity of the persons of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.310" end="00:26:52.020" style="s2">moment instead of looking for a map or a</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.700" end="00:26:54.690" style="s2">strategy mmm yeah yeah yeah I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.020" end="00:26:58.560" style="s2">definitely uh all those things you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.690" end="00:27:00.870" style="s2">talking about I feel somehow when this</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.560" end="00:27:03.060" style="s2">happened I feel like I all these things</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.870" end="00:27:05.190" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about I had at least some</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.060" end="00:27:09.660" style="s2">understanding of them on a theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.190" end="00:27:11.520" style="s2">level you know but when you say it now</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.660" end="00:27:12.600" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s something different than if</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.520" end="00:27:14.280" style="s2">you had said those things</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.600" end="00:27:16.260" style="s2">a month ago I might have been thinking</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.280" end="00:27:19.410" style="s2">it on a more intellectual level or</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.260" end="00:27:21.360" style="s2">something right it&#39;s not an abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.410" end="00:27:25.620" style="s2">anymore it&#39;s it&#39;s no longer an</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.360" end="00:27:28.350" style="s2">abstraction but not that&#39;s that that&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.620" end="00:27:30.120" style="s2">think that&#39;s an extraordinary kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.350" end="00:27:33.570" style="s2">experience that maybe people are having</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.120" end="00:27:39.440" style="s2">it&#39;s just the real is approaching on the</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.570" end="00:27:43.340" style="s2">realist is is more as more vivid yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.440" end="00:27:48.060" style="s2">and it&#39;s the blurring is more vivid</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.340" end="00:27:50.700" style="s2">right so the the blurring of how can a</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.060" end="00:27:52.830" style="s2">health issue be an economic issue being</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.700" end="00:27:56.880" style="s2">an education issue be a culture issue</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.830" end="00:28:00.480" style="s2">via science issue be irate it&#39;s all one</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.880" end="00:28:03.240" style="s2">issue so there&#39;s there no way to pull</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.480" end="00:28:06.720" style="s2">this thing into pieces and fix it</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.240" end="00:28:09.150" style="s2">it&#39;s various roles right there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.720" end="00:28:11.330" style="s2">roles you can&#39;t you can&#39;t divide this</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.150" end="00:28:12.870" style="s2">thing back into sectors and fix it</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.330" end="00:28:15.420" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.870" end="00:28:18.270" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t look that it&#39;s not possible</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.420" end="00:28:20.190" style="s2">it&#39;s not living there mm-hmm it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.270" end="00:28:24.990" style="s2">the sector&#39;s it&#39;s this connective tissue</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.190" end="00:28:28.400" style="s2">between them and so there&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.990" end="00:28:31.170" style="s2">nobody positioned to respond</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.400" end="00:28:33.570" style="s2">there&#39;s nobody no person position to</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.170" end="00:28:35.340" style="s2">respond there&#39;s no Ministry of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.570" end="00:28:38.970" style="s2">liminal you know like that make sure</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.340" end="00:28:40.950" style="s2">there&#39;s nobody whose job it is to tackle</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.970" end="00:28:42.690" style="s2">all this at once and so you have oh</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.950" end="00:28:44.850" style="s2">there&#39;s no ministry but then there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.690" end="00:28:47.610" style="s2">spontaneous response that is happening</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.850" end="00:28:50.610" style="s2">right because anyways right right</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.610" end="00:28:54.600" style="s2">because we are actually living beings</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.610" end="00:28:56.940" style="s2">and we&#39;re not we&#39;re not um totally numb</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.600" end="00:29:01.470" style="s2">we might be a little numb but we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.940" end="00:29:03.270" style="s2">totally them so there&#39;s a need to to</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.470" end="00:29:09.390" style="s2">respond from a different positioning</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.270" end="00:29:14.850" style="s2">it&#39;s I&#39;m fascinated by the way in which</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.390" end="00:29:16.980" style="s2">there&#39;s some these big questions even</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.850" end="00:29:22.320" style="s2">about you know what how how science</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.980" end="00:29:23.970" style="s2">works in this mm-hmm oh yeah this is</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.320" end="00:29:26.760" style="s2">good because one of the questions I</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.970" end="00:29:29.460" style="s2">wanted to ask you actually and from</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.760" end="00:29:31.080" style="s2">watching your film about your father and</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.460" end="00:29:32.640" style="s2">thinking about your childhood and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.080" end="00:29:34.410" style="s2">thinking about the fact that you were</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.640" end="00:29:37.679" style="s2">raised and I remember him saying in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.410" end="00:29:40.410" style="s2">film that the arts came came before</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.679" end="00:29:42.300" style="s2">science for him on some level like the</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.410" end="00:29:44.880" style="s2">ground was kind of the arts and that not</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.300" end="00:29:46.410" style="s2">moved into science I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.880" end="00:29:48.510" style="s2">getting that that right or that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.410" end="00:29:51.270" style="s2">he wanted to say but I kind of wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.510" end="00:29:53.010" style="s2">talk to you about that the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.270" end="00:29:54.530" style="s2">between the arts and science or a</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.010" end="00:29:57.090" style="s2">relationship between let&#39;s say a</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.530" end="00:29:58.620" style="s2">scientific response we could talk we</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.090" end="00:30:02.910" style="s2">could talk about the response to what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.620" end="00:30:05.120" style="s2">going on today or and let&#39;s say a poetic</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.910" end="00:30:05.120" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.130" end="00:30:14.740" style="s2">artistic response and I know that I know</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.130" end="00:30:16.990" style="s2">that your father sort of almost he saw a</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.740" end="00:30:21.280" style="s2">science and in a very poetic way or or</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.990" end="00:30:24.700" style="s2">something like that yeah this is a</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.280" end="00:30:28.480" style="s2">really big deep convoluted question yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.700" end="00:30:31.600" style="s2">yeah I I think let&#39;s go back to this</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.480" end="00:30:35.679" style="s2">notion of the matrix okay and let&#39;s talk</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.600" end="00:30:45.760" style="s2">about how what where where it&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.679" end="00:30:48.460" style="s2">to to learn because you know it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.760" end="00:30:51.549" style="s2">really all too easy to find what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.460" end="00:30:54.909" style="s2">looking for and the the the issue around</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.549" end="00:30:57.039" style="s2">what keeps happening with trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.909" end="00:30:59.140" style="s2">out of the matrix is that the plans to</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.039" end="00:31:01.960" style="s2">get out of the matrix are informed by</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.140" end="00:31:04.929" style="s2">the matrix and so it ends up not getting</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.960" end="00:31:07.419" style="s2">us out yeah but instead getting us</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.929" end="00:31:11.740" style="s2">deeper in because the actual thinking</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.419" end="00:31:17.260" style="s2">patterns are what has produced the set</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.740" end="00:31:19.600" style="s2">of traps you know Wittgenstein talked</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.260" end="00:31:22.630" style="s2">about this the fly in the bottle you</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.600" end="00:31:27.280" style="s2">know and the fly can&#39;t see that it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.630" end="00:31:29.679" style="s2">a bottle and because it banging its head</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.280" end="00:31:33.490" style="s2">against it just yeah it has no idea that</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.679" end="00:31:35.590" style="s2">it&#39;s in a bottle so and that&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.490" end="00:31:37.870" style="s2">bit of where we are and until you get</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.590" end="00:31:40.840" style="s2">these cracks until you get these broken</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.870" end="00:31:43.360" style="s2">pieces or you see something that is not</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.840" end="00:31:47.520" style="s2">of your culture is not of its its</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.360" end="00:31:51.250" style="s2">business that&#39;s breaking those patterns</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.520" end="00:31:53.140" style="s2">or creating a disruption in them it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.250" end="00:31:56.380" style="s2">very difficult to notice that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.140" end="00:31:58.960" style="s2">even there hmm you know like if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.380" end="00:32:02.039" style="s2">in water that&#39;s that&#39;s body temperature</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.960" end="00:32:05.169" style="s2">you could just not even feel that water</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.039" end="00:32:10.929" style="s2">and so that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of what we</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.169" end="00:32:13.840" style="s2">have been in is and we being well we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.929" end="00:32:16.480" style="s2">had too much familiarity comfort mmm and</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.840" end="00:32:19.040" style="s2">sleepiness or something like that well</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.480" end="00:32:23.150" style="s2">some people have and some people haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.040" end="00:32:28.370" style="s2">Yeah right well that&#39;s you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.150" end="00:32:32.630" style="s2">the fallacy of the success of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.370" end="00:32:35.770" style="s2">existing system is only harbored by the</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.630" end="00:32:39.440" style="s2">people who have comfortable living rooms</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.770" end="00:32:41.780" style="s2">yeah right so let&#39;s don&#39;t forget that</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.440" end="00:32:44.180" style="s2">you know certainly in my work when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.780" end="00:32:45.770" style="s2">working in vulnerable communities and</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.180" end="00:32:49.280" style="s2">places where there&#39;s been a huge</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.770" end="00:32:52.070" style="s2">betrayal by the system those groupings</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.280" end="00:32:53.780" style="s2">of people are the fastest to see the</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.070" end="00:32:57.290" style="s2">systemic issues because they live in</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.780" end="00:32:59.800" style="s2">them hmm right there&#39;s no room to have</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.290" end="00:33:02.890" style="s2">the idea that this is the successful</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.800" end="00:33:09.140" style="s2">system this is not a successful system</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.890" end="00:33:11.780" style="s2">mm-hmm unless you happen to be you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.140" end="00:33:16.190" style="s2">sitting comfortably in the exploits of</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.780" end="00:33:19.160" style="s2">it so so yeah so what what do we do what</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.190" end="00:33:23.480" style="s2">is this biz what is information how do</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.160" end="00:33:28.550" style="s2">we if we got new information would we</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.480" end="00:33:31.070" style="s2">even be able to see it mm-hmm what kind</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.550" end="00:33:32.960" style="s2">of question can we not ask because we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.070" end="00:33:36.860" style="s2">never thought of asking it because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.960" end="00:33:39.370" style="s2">outside the peripheries of the patterns</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.860" end="00:33:41.840" style="s2">of thinking that that are familiar</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.370" end="00:33:44.300" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.840" end="00:33:46.820" style="s2">so this these are the kinds of questions</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.300" end="00:33:52.850" style="s2">that when we&#39;re trying to think about</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.820" end="00:33:54.710" style="s2">what does it take to have what is the</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.850" end="00:34:00.230" style="s2">relationship between art and science</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.710" end="00:34:04.070" style="s2">so the the arts actually provoke the</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.230" end="00:34:07.130" style="s2">possibility for perception to take place</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.070" end="00:34:11.870" style="s2">because they provide an irrational world</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.130" end="00:34:15.110" style="s2">hmm and that irrational Ness is really</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.870" end="00:34:18.200" style="s2">really necessary it&#39;s that that that</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.110" end="00:34:20.530" style="s2">thing you know that allows stuff breaks</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.200" end="00:34:24.020" style="s2">the matrix it breaks out of the box it</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.530" end="00:34:26.419" style="s2">if if it&#39;s possible to perceive it but</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.020" end="00:34:30.440" style="s2">but there&#39;s also the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.419" end="00:34:31.960" style="s2">using those same metaphors to generate</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.440" end="00:34:34.540" style="s2">our</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.960" end="00:34:38.320" style="s2">and to pull on I&#39;m wearing my Steve</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.540" end="00:34:44.050" style="s2">Bannon jacket today and to pull on those</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.320" end="00:34:48.460" style="s2">those fears and unspoken qualities that</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.050" end="00:34:51.280" style="s2">can actually drive us deeper in so we</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.460" end="00:34:55.389" style="s2">have every every capacity as human</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.280" end="00:34:58.270" style="s2">beings to think what we want is systems</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.389" end="00:35:00.369" style="s2">change start to feel the passion and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.270" end="00:35:03.400" style="s2">fervor of wanting to create that</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.369" end="00:35:06.790" style="s2">system&#39;s change and create a change that</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.400" end="00:35:09.369" style="s2">gets us deeper in to where we were</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.790" end="00:35:10.780" style="s2">hoping to get out of yeah yeah I see</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.369" end="00:35:13.260" style="s2">that I see that a lot I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.780" end="00:35:16.570" style="s2">happening a lot you know I think the</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.260" end="00:35:19.150" style="s2">almost the fury that people have just</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.570" end="00:35:22.119" style="s2">entrenches them deeper into the system</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.150" end="00:35:24.880" style="s2">they become pawns for you know the</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.119" end="00:35:28.030" style="s2">people that are that are keeping them in</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.880" end="00:35:31.000" style="s2">that system or yeah and and they nothing</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.030" end="00:35:34.000" style="s2">I mean I&#39;ve done it yeah okay it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.000" end="00:35:35.800" style="s2">so seductive that it&#39;s you the problem</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.000" end="00:35:38.020" style="s2">is you don&#39;t know when you&#39;re doing it</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.800" end="00:35:40.330" style="s2">because it&#39;s it&#39;s that glass jar that</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.020" end="00:35:43.270" style="s2">you&#39;re in with us that&#39;s why you just</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.330" end="00:35:46.690" style="s2">you you know it&#39;s it&#39;s what that danger</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.270" end="00:35:49.810" style="s2">is right there so I guess you know one</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.690" end="00:35:51.700" style="s2">thing about this moment right now is</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.810" end="00:35:55.480" style="s2">that since everything&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.700" end="00:35:56.320" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a good time to kick some</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.480" end="00:35:58.660" style="s2">addictions</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.320" end="00:36:02.550" style="s2">you know we you&#39;ve never been a smoker</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.660" end="00:36:05.230" style="s2">or had any kind of addictive mm-hm</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.550" end="00:36:07.030" style="s2">stuff in your life when you&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.230" end="00:36:10.630" style="s2">moment where all the patterns change</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.030" end="00:36:18.490" style="s2">that&#39;s a really good time to kick yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.630" end="00:36:26.500" style="s2">sure but there&#39;s there&#39;s a kind of cold</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.490" end="00:36:28.140" style="s2">turkey going on yeah yeah bringing it</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.500" end="00:36:32.230" style="s2">back back to the Arts and the</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.140" end="00:36:33.880" style="s2">possibility of let&#39;s say of poetry it</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.230" end="00:36:36.280" style="s2">occurs to me when you were talking that</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.880" end="00:36:40.119" style="s2">that&#39;s the thing that the arts in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.280" end="00:36:43.270" style="s2">poetry can do is provide that depth to</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.119" end="00:36:45.690" style="s2">to ideas right you know because if we</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.270" end="00:36:49.470" style="s2">just have an idea we tend to run with</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.690" end="00:36:52.740" style="s2">and become very ideologically possessed</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.470" end="00:37:00.810" style="s2">on some level but if we have if we have</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.740" end="00:37:05.130" style="s2">a deep if there&#39;s a deep complex poetic</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.810" end="00:37:09.200" style="s2">sense of our experience then then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.130" end="00:37:09.200" style="s2">not so easily you know fooled by</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.470" end="00:37:20.170" style="s2">bye-bye easy bye-bye ready-made</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.660" end="00:37:23.770" style="s2">or easy patterns it&#39;s a tricky one</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.170" end="00:37:26.660" style="s2">because I think you can also look at</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.770" end="00:37:30.849" style="s2">some of the darkest moments in human</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.660" end="00:37:34.789" style="s2">history and see how they were actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.849" end="00:37:40.010" style="s2">fueled by metaphor and the arts mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.789" end="00:37:47.089" style="s2">so it can cut either way okay and but</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.010" end="00:37:49.460" style="s2">there is there is a loosening okay so</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.089" end="00:37:54.020" style="s2">once it but the question is once it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.460" end="00:37:56.569" style="s2">loose then what so art the arts might</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.020" end="00:38:00.079" style="s2">have a quality of loosening up the fixed</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.569" end="00:38:01.730" style="s2">patterns and then the patterns could go</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.079" end="00:38:03.710" style="s2">into something extreme again or</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.730" end="00:38:07.339" style="s2">something like this they could lock get</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.710" end="00:38:12.920" style="s2">locked in or something more living could</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.339" end="00:38:18.619" style="s2">be creative yeah and and where does that</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.920" end="00:38:22.430" style="s2">set of pathways come from I have no idea</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.619" end="00:38:24.079" style="s2">I mean where do where does that happen</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.430" end="00:38:26.510" style="s2">where does it happen where does it</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.079" end="00:38:29.329" style="s2">happen that you know using that metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.510" end="00:38:32.630" style="s2">of addiction that that sometimes when</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.329" end="00:38:35.569" style="s2">people have addiction they destroy their</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.630" end="00:38:38.150" style="s2">family they abandon their elders they</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.569" end="00:38:40.970" style="s2">abandon their kids and then one day</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.150" end="00:38:42.890" style="s2">something else comes along that might</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.970" end="00:38:44.900" style="s2">first be perceived as somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.890" end="00:38:46.640" style="s2">inconsequential but it&#39;s the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.900" end="00:38:49.490" style="s2">actually allows the learning to take</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.640" end="00:38:51.890" style="s2">place and there&#39;s the turnaround yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.490" end="00:38:54.770" style="s2">other people never get there and they</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.890" end="00:38:57.980" style="s2">just go all the way down and they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.770" end="00:39:00.470" style="s2">they don&#39;t get they don&#39;t get out so a</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.980" end="00:39:03.109" style="s2">you know there&#39;s some and this is where</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.470" end="00:39:05.210" style="s2">I think we&#39;re it&#39;s the trans contextual</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.109" end="00:39:09.319" style="s2">learning thing is really important is</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.210" end="00:39:12.319" style="s2">that there&#39;s um trans can sexual yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.319" end="00:39:14.420" style="s2">our multidisciplinary or just knowing a</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.319" end="00:39:17.670" style="s2">lot of different fields rather than</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.420" end="00:39:22.170" style="s2">being ghettoized in one</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.670" end="00:39:25.559" style="s2">well like when we were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.170" end="00:39:28.049" style="s2">identity mm-hmm what context is your</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.559" end="00:39:30.630" style="s2">identity in you know it&#39;s multiple</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.049" end="00:39:34.109" style="s2">context what disciplines how about the</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.630" end="00:39:37.559" style="s2">disciplines I mean I I think it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.109" end="00:39:41.609" style="s2">contextual than disciplinary so you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.559" end="00:39:45.960" style="s2">I agree with that yeah so my identity if</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.609" end="00:39:49.760" style="s2">there&#39;s a change in my identity that</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.960" end="00:39:53.039" style="s2">change is going to be produced and and</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.760" end="00:39:56.369" style="s2">reflected and engaged across multiple</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.039" end="00:39:59.670" style="s2">and through multiple contexts right so</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.369" end="00:40:03.049" style="s2">here I am I&#39;m stuck at home yeah there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.670" end="00:40:05.880" style="s2">a change and that change is in my</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.049" end="00:40:13.140" style="s2">relationship with my partner it&#39;s in my</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.880" end="00:40:21.109" style="s2">relationship with my even my wardrobe my</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.140" end="00:40:25.230" style="s2">pajamas all the time yeah just the top</p>

<p begin="00:40:25.230" end="00:40:32.789" style="s2">but but also what I&#39;m eating what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.970" end="00:40:36.390" style="s2">thinking about what I&#39;m reading what</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.789" end="00:40:38.369" style="s2">kind of conversations I&#39;m having you</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.390" end="00:40:40.430" style="s2">know I don&#39;t spend any of that time when</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.369" end="00:40:44.549" style="s2">I used to spend plotting and planning</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.430" end="00:40:49.230" style="s2">schedules yeah whole conversation is</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.549" end="00:40:51.779" style="s2">gone I&#39;m not spending any time booking</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.230" end="00:40:54.269" style="s2">airplane tickets I&#39;m not spending any</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.779" end="00:40:56.730" style="s2">time producing powerpoints for key notes</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.269" end="00:41:00.210" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m not spending you know like my</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.730" end="00:41:03.630" style="s2">losses liberation of time hmm so all</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.210" end="00:41:06.269" style="s2">these different contexts are changing in</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.630" end="00:41:09.930" style="s2">the same time but they have different</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.269" end="00:41:12.299" style="s2">time qualities to them so it&#39;s it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.930" end="00:41:15.619" style="s2">is what I mean about trends contextual</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.299" end="00:41:19.650" style="s2">shift if I had said to myself in</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.619" end="00:41:22.769" style="s2">February or late January what I need is</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.650" end="00:41:25.710" style="s2">to make some changes in my life I like</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.769" end="00:41:28.859" style="s2">the picked a few categories to change</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.710" end="00:41:31.230" style="s2">yeah I need to get more exercise I need</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.859" end="00:41:31.530" style="s2">to change my diet I need to have some</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.230" end="00:41:36.120" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.530" end="00:41:37.890" style="s2">time with my partner hmm right and they</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.120" end="00:41:40.440" style="s2">would have been those are like</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.890" end="00:41:43.320" style="s2">reductionist approaches to solutionizing</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.440" end="00:41:44.550" style="s2">the need for change I&#39;ve identified that</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.320" end="00:41:48.690" style="s2">something needs to change</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.550" end="00:41:50.400" style="s2">yeah but you see the difference so you</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.690" end="00:41:53.610" style="s2">try to change them in categories instead</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.400" end="00:41:55.680" style="s2">of instead of finding out how would you</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.610" end="00:41:56.880" style="s2">change I mean how do we change well as</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.680" end="00:41:58.620" style="s2">you say you see that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.880" end="00:42:00.750" style="s2">mysterious how the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.620" end="00:42:03.530" style="s2">alcoholic would decide one day that you</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.750" end="00:42:06.150" style="s2">know you suddenly have a turn around and</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.530" end="00:42:09.750" style="s2">but something comes in hitting bottom</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.150" end="00:42:14.040" style="s2">side right something came in the virus</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.750" end="00:42:16.710" style="s2">was a systems change bringer a prett</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.040" end="00:42:21.690" style="s2">right it brought it we&#39;ve been talking</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.710" end="00:42:25.470" style="s2">you know change agents um change makers</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.690" end="00:42:27.630" style="s2">and all this blah blah blah yeah no one</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.470" end="00:42:30.240" style="s2">was making any change at all yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.630" end="00:42:32.730" style="s2">exactly yeah so then along comes a</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.240" end="00:42:36.180" style="s2">little itty-bitty virus and now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.730" end="00:42:38.970" style="s2">changing so but but the thing is this</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.180" end="00:42:43.290" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t trying to change one thing at</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.970" end="00:42:45.930" style="s2">a time it came in as a trans contextual</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.290" end="00:42:51.780" style="s2">systems changer everything changed</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.930" end="00:42:52.440" style="s2">mmm-hmm and that&#39;s how systems change</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.780" end="00:42:54.960" style="s2">happens</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.440" end="00:42:56.520" style="s2">that&#39;s how system change happens hmm but</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.960" end="00:42:58.680" style="s2">we can&#39;t really create let&#39;s say a</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.520" end="00:43:01.500" style="s2">positive virus like how would we how</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.680" end="00:43:03.030" style="s2">would we create like a good virus I mean</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.500" end="00:43:04.590" style="s2">good and bad again and again good and</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.030" end="00:43:07.290" style="s2">bad it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of ridiculous isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.590" end="00:43:10.800" style="s2">it but what is positive systems change</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.290" end="00:43:15.500" style="s2">no how would you know like how how bad</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.800" end="00:43:18.270" style="s2">do we have if it&#39;s the socio-economic</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.500" end="00:43:20.070" style="s2">response technological response to this</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.270" end="00:43:21.780" style="s2">is to create higher levels of</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.070" end="00:43:23.970" style="s2">surveillance and police state and</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.780" end="00:43:26.730" style="s2">control and all of these dark things</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.970" end="00:43:28.050" style="s2">they do contribute looming right now</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.730" end="00:43:30.870" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.050" end="00:43:32.910" style="s2">if that&#39;s the response then my guess is</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.870" end="00:43:36.120" style="s2">there&#39;s a bigger crash coming after that</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.910" end="00:43:40.680" style="s2">yeah sure yeah right so what&#39;s it gonna</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.120" end="00:43:44.470" style="s2">take to learn how to actually live in a</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.680" end="00:43:49.119" style="s2">way that produces vitality in life</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.470" end="00:43:51.160" style="s2">sure yeah and and so where it seems if</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.119" end="00:43:53.710" style="s2">in getting in touch with suffering on</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.160" end="00:43:55.720" style="s2">some level right I mean I just think of</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.710" end="00:43:57.400" style="s2">the Buddhists first noble truth that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.720" end="00:44:00.340" style="s2">the beginning right so I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.400" end="00:44:02.020" style="s2">what could a positive virus be but but</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.340" end="00:44:04.359" style="s2">no it&#39;s not that it&#39;s that it&#39;s that we</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.020" end="00:44:08.440" style="s2">have to get in touch with our suffering</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.359" end="00:44:11.050" style="s2">and on some level maybe or there has to</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.440" end="00:44:16.030" style="s2">be a shift in perception of what it is</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.050" end="00:44:18.130" style="s2">that is is what what are we learning</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.030" end="00:44:21.040" style="s2">what are we learning right so it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.130" end="00:44:24.130" style="s2">kind of an evolutionary question mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.040" end="00:44:27.190" style="s2">and so if there is the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.130" end="00:44:29.830" style="s2">learning now that we you know that that</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.190" end="00:44:32.590" style="s2">economies that are based on built-in</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.830" end="00:44:37.720" style="s2">obsolescence and exploitation and</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.590" end="00:44:40.090" style="s2">extraction don&#39;t actually produce life</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.720" end="00:44:45.099" style="s2">then we have a different problem to work</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.090" end="00:44:49.599" style="s2">on which is how then do we find a way to</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.099" end="00:44:52.900" style="s2">produce a decent way of being alive for</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.599" end="00:44:55.030" style="s2">seven billion people yeah right and</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.900" end="00:44:57.250" style="s2">that&#39;s a different set of questions then</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.030" end="00:45:02.550" style="s2">how do we go back to the normal we had</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.250" end="00:45:05.880" style="s2">which was actually which was actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.550" end="00:45:09.220" style="s2">creating all kinds of problems not just</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.880" end="00:45:14.560" style="s2">viruses but over behind their problem so</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.220" end="00:45:18.220" style="s2">so is the what but you never know and I</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.560" end="00:45:20.920" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s for anyone to judge is</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.220" end="00:45:23.260" style="s2">this what is a good systems change and</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.920" end="00:45:26.349" style="s2">what is a bad systems change it is for</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.260" end="00:45:28.390" style="s2">us to not be numb right and I get really</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.349" end="00:45:30.250" style="s2">itchy about the kind of discussion</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.390" end="00:45:34.359" style="s2">around what are the opportunities that</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.250" end="00:45:39.820" style="s2">are arising out of you know because to</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.359" end="00:45:44.290" style="s2">me that is a red flag that that this</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.820" end="00:45:48.070" style="s2">kind of attraction to ever positive</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.290" end="00:45:50.230" style="s2">thinking could easily prohibit the pain</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.070" end="00:45:51.760" style="s2">and the sensation of well that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.230" end="00:45:54.849" style="s2">what I was trying to get I was suffering</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.760" end="00:45:56.010" style="s2">because because because I thought so</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.849" end="00:45:58.290" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.010" end="00:46:00.210" style="s2">yeah yeah we have to be able to feel the</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.290" end="00:46:04.560" style="s2">rate which feel the pain feels a little</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.210" end="00:46:09.359" style="s2">feel the back feel the crack in our</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.560" end="00:46:12.650" style="s2">matrix mm-hmm it&#39;s never going to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.359" end="00:46:12.650" style="s2">easy of course not</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.710" end="00:46:20.550" style="s2">yeah that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.510" end="00:46:28.680" style="s2">mm-hmm but the sensitivity to it is I</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.550" end="00:46:30.720" style="s2">think the development well I was</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.680" end="00:46:32.869" style="s2">thinking that there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.720" end="00:46:36.690" style="s2">the capitalist system right is that</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.869" end="00:46:38.369" style="s2">human beings it works B it works and it</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.690" end="00:46:41.250" style="s2">destroys at the same time because we</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.369" end="00:46:42.630" style="s2">like excess right we just we just want</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.250" end="00:46:45.119" style="s2">to create more and more and more and</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.630" end="00:46:46.950" style="s2">more and we just keep going and we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.119" end="00:46:51.240" style="s2">again we don&#39;t really stop but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.950" end="00:46:52.770" style="s2">there&#39;s this constant excess which is</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.240" end="00:46:54.630" style="s2">why it does the opposite doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.770" end="00:46:57.480" style="s2">when you try to control everything and</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.630" end="00:46:59.400" style="s2">you try to you know you try you try to</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.480" end="00:47:01.140" style="s2">have a communist country and you try to</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.400" end="00:47:03.119" style="s2">manipulate everything so that everybody</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.140" end="00:47:07.050" style="s2">is the same so both of those kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.119" end="00:47:09.780" style="s2">extremes I was thinking what do we do</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.050" end="00:47:13.290" style="s2">with the excess right of human you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.780" end="00:47:15.060" style="s2">folly right you know William Blake says</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.290" end="00:47:21.350" style="s2">if a fool persist in the folly they</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.060" end="00:47:21.350" style="s2">become wise I&#39;m wondering if that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.010" end="00:47:28.410" style="s2">this persistent folly that the culture</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.840" end="00:47:30.480" style="s2">has been engaged in for so long has a</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.410" end="00:47:32.310" style="s2">possibility at least a few people you</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.480" end="00:47:34.800" style="s2">know will become more wise and that that</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.310" end="00:47:36.390" style="s2">might be good it also has the</p>

<p begin="00:48:57.250" end="00:49:03.640" style="s2">darkness all around and so I as far as I</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.270" end="00:49:05.770" style="s2">can see it&#39;s double binds and paradoxes</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.640" end="00:49:09.610" style="s2">all the way down all the double-blind -</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.770" end="00:49:12.520" style="s2">yeah and so I think that the reason that</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.610" end="00:49:16.080" style="s2">I keep doing this to you and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.520" end="00:49:21.550" style="s2">apologize but I do do this to people but</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.080" end="00:49:24.100" style="s2">but it&#39;s that there it&#39;s not about</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.550" end="00:49:27.330" style="s2">finding solutions it&#39;s about standing in</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.100" end="00:49:30.160" style="s2">the tension it&#39;s about being in and and</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.330" end="00:49:32.080" style="s2">attention right well that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.160" end="00:49:33.520" style="s2">thing in your film I I was struck by you</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.080" end="00:49:35.230" style="s2">saying cuz usually we talk all the</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.520" end="00:49:37.270" style="s2">double bind yeah I get that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.230" end="00:49:39.400" style="s2">problem that&#39;s how I always thought of</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.270" end="00:49:41.410" style="s2">the double bind and you say no the</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.400" end="00:49:43.060" style="s2">double bind is the opportunity when</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.410" end="00:49:46.000" style="s2">you&#39;re when you can see the double bond</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.060" end="00:49:49.870" style="s2">that&#39;s the dialectic then it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.000" end="00:49:51.670" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a creative imperative it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.870" end="00:49:55.630" style="s2">That moment when rate of imperative yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.670" end="00:49:58.900" style="s2">then there has to be another a whole</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.630" end="00:50:03.130" style="s2">another whole perception of this thing</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.900" end="00:50:05.860" style="s2">that seemed like an impossible set of</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.130" end="00:50:10.980" style="s2">circumstances and and that&#39;s that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.860" end="00:50:12.970" style="s2">I mean about the the lifeboat metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.980" end="00:50:15.430" style="s2">right if you look at the lifeboat</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.970" end="00:50:17.560" style="s2">metaphor as there&#39;s 32 people in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.430" end="00:50:19.300" style="s2">water and 17 on the boat and that boat</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.560" end="00:50:22.180" style="s2">can only take 17</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.300" end="00:50:26.710" style="s2">so you have to figure out who&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.180" end="00:50:29.080" style="s2">die right it&#39;s the wrong question it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.710" end="00:50:31.870" style="s2">horrible thing isn&#39;t it to write</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.080" end="00:50:33.730" style="s2">somebody yeah but but I&#39;m just using</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.870" end="00:50:37.600" style="s2">that because it&#39;s the kind of question</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.730" end="00:50:41.350" style="s2">that people keep presenting and it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.600" end="00:50:46.060" style="s2">wrong kind of question it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.350" end="00:50:50.800" style="s2">like informed by the kind of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.060" end="00:50:54.220" style="s2">that is thinking about you know how many</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.800" end="00:50:56.710" style="s2">boards does it take to build something</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.220" end="00:50:58.360" style="s2">or how many parts are in the engine and</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.710" end="00:50:59.980" style="s2">if you don&#39;t have enough parts you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.360" end="00:51:03.220" style="s2">have an engine if you have too many</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.980" end="00:51:05.290" style="s2">parts you have leftovers you don&#39;t put</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.220" end="00:51:08.980" style="s2">extra parts in an engine just to put</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.290" end="00:51:12.760" style="s2">extra parts in but you can put extra</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.980" end="00:51:14.980" style="s2">people in a boat you can divide the</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.760" end="00:51:17.800" style="s2">weight in different ways you can figure</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.980" end="00:51:20.470" style="s2">out who swims you can respond so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.800" end="00:51:24.690" style="s2">it&#39;s like when you&#39;re asking questions</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.470" end="00:51:29.650" style="s2">and forming inquiry about living systems</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.690" end="00:51:31.390" style="s2">the whole thing changes yeah and and</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.650" end="00:51:34.120" style="s2">there are these tensions and these</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.390" end="00:51:37.450" style="s2">paradoxes these double clients that move</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.120" end="00:51:41.950" style="s2">in in entirely different ways than if we</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.450" end="00:51:47.080" style="s2">were trying to you know solve for X and</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.950" end="00:51:48.430" style="s2">and so I think that&#39;s that&#39;s where I I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.080" end="00:51:51.820" style="s2">always trying to hold the door open</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.430" end="00:51:55.240" style="s2">don&#39;t be in a hurry to solve this just</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.820" end="00:51:57.280" style="s2">be in it because your attention in in a</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.240" end="00:52:00.880" style="s2">paradox or in a double-blind when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.280" end="00:52:03.730" style="s2">paying attention what you get is it is</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.880" end="00:52:07.750" style="s2">the benefit of zoom in zoom out</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.730" end="00:52:10.030" style="s2">simultaneously uh-huh and in that you</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.750" end="00:52:11.590" style="s2">will be able to see potentialities and</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.030" end="00:52:13.320" style="s2">possibilities that you didn&#39;t otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.590" end="00:52:16.840" style="s2">have access to</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.320" end="00:52:20.290" style="s2">uh-huh right right if you just zoom out</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.840" end="00:52:24.940" style="s2">you miss all the detail if you just zoom</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.290" end="00:52:28.930" style="s2">in you miss all the context mm-hmm but</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.940" end="00:52:31.930" style="s2">together but that&#39;s a kind of it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.930" end="00:52:32.430" style="s2">kind of exercise a kind of muscle a kind</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.930" end="00:52:35.039" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.430" end="00:52:37.859" style="s2">well that that goes back I think to arts</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.039" end="00:52:41.069" style="s2">and the poetics because you can&#39;t write</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.859" end="00:52:42.420" style="s2">a poem I mean or write a song or you</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.069" end="00:52:45.230" style="s2">don&#39;t say okay I&#39;m gonna write a song</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.420" end="00:52:48.029" style="s2">now like you can&#39;t just construct some</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.230" end="00:52:50.490" style="s2">something like that right you have to</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.029" end="00:52:52.470" style="s2">you have to you have to kind of you have</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.490" end="00:52:54.930" style="s2">to be in a moment you have to allow the</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.470" end="00:52:57.089" style="s2">moment to emerge or something in you and</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.930" end="00:52:58.200" style="s2">then and then and then so you&#39;re zooming</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.089" end="00:52:59.760" style="s2">out and looking at it and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.200" end="00:53:01.140" style="s2">assembling things but the same time</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.760" end="00:53:04.770" style="s2">you&#39;re being taken over by something</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.140" end="00:53:09.000" style="s2">else does that make sense oh so much</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.770" end="00:53:11.490" style="s2">sense yeah yeah I mean I feel that all</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.000" end="00:53:14.339" style="s2">the time even when when I watched that</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.490" end="00:53:16.289" style="s2">film that you&#39;re referring to that I</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.339" end="00:53:18.359" style="s2">made I can&#39;t tell you how many times</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.289" end="00:53:20.730" style="s2">I&#39;ve watched it and I thought wow I</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.359" end="00:53:23.119" style="s2">wonder how I ever came up with the idea</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.730" end="00:53:25.980" style="s2">to have put those two shots together</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.119" end="00:53:28.230" style="s2">what a great idea that was that was a</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.980" end="00:53:30.240" style="s2">really good idea how did I get come up</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.230" end="00:53:36.240" style="s2">with that and it&#39;s like this bizarre</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.240" end="00:53:37.440" style="s2">kind of there&#39;s no authorship there no</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.240" end="00:53:39.450" style="s2">there&#39;s no no I agree</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.440" end="00:53:43.950" style="s2">whatever the hell that the whole concept</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.450" end="00:53:46.349" style="s2">is it&#39;s wrong it had to do with some I</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.950" end="00:53:47.849" style="s2">mean I didn&#39;t even see some of the the</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.349" end="00:53:50.190" style="s2">things that I did that were the best</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.849" end="00:53:53.010" style="s2">parts of that film until years later</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.190" end="00:53:55.230" style="s2">yeah well I was talking to John for</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.010" end="00:53:57.569" style="s2">Vicki he talks about dialogue OC about</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.230" end="00:53:59.700" style="s2">this kind of sacred dialogue and he says</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.569" end="00:54:02.279" style="s2">when you&#39;re really in dialogue goes then</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.700" end="00:54:03.779" style="s2">this third factor emerges so and he</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.279" end="00:54:06.690" style="s2">called it the third factor this third</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.779" end="00:54:10.559" style="s2">sort of thing in that and not that you</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.690" end="00:54:12.119" style="s2">know again you can&#39;t even put a name to</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.559" end="00:54:16.980" style="s2">that that it&#39;s it is but it&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.119" end="00:54:19.559" style="s2">not you don&#39;t create it with any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.980" end="00:54:22.529" style="s2">intentionality I don&#39;t think I think it</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.559" end="00:54:25.529" style="s2">just overtakes you in some way on the</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.529" end="00:54:27.630" style="s2">contrary I think if you try to put</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.529" end="00:54:31.859" style="s2">intentionality on it it runs away</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.630" end="00:54:34.980" style="s2">exactly yeah it&#39;s it doesn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.859" end="00:54:37.289" style="s2">like it on the other hand you have to do</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.980" end="00:54:41.099" style="s2">the work and you have to you know invite</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.289" end="00:54:43.289" style="s2">it like you can&#39;t just write gotta have</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.099" end="00:54:45.519" style="s2">this skill you gotta have worked for it</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.289" end="00:54:49.929" style="s2">you gotta practice you got to make the</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.519" end="00:54:51.729" style="s2">I&#39;m for it and then you have to not be</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.929" end="00:54:53.709" style="s2">let it fall apart or something you have</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.729" end="00:54:55.679" style="s2">to let things fall apart this way yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.709" end="00:54:58.859" style="s2">get out of the way</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.679" end="00:55:07.029" style="s2">hmm yeah I don&#39;t know it&#39;s a funny thing</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.859" end="00:55:08.949" style="s2">it&#39;s a funny thing but I am I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.029" end="00:55:13.029" style="s2">I don&#39;t know what do you think where are</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.949" end="00:55:16.829" style="s2">we what happens now and we&#39;re you know I</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.029" end="00:55:22.809" style="s2">think this is a critical moment of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.829" end="00:55:27.909" style="s2">the vortex the you know post normalcy</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.809" end="00:55:29.169" style="s2">are like yeah well I mean you know the</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.909" end="00:55:31.390" style="s2">word that comes to me is like</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.169" end="00:55:35.249" style="s2">groundlessness and but groundlessness is</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.390" end="00:55:37.269" style="s2">sort of possibility so I feel like I</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.249" end="00:55:42.390" style="s2">don&#39;t know I can&#39;t speak for other</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.269" end="00:55:45.459" style="s2">people&#39;s lives but I feel like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.390" end="00:55:47.769" style="s2">it&#39;s a weird it&#39;s a weird thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.459" end="00:55:50.649" style="s2">like it&#39;s like something is opening up</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.769" end="00:55:52.739" style="s2">and saying okay this is how this is here</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.649" end="00:55:56.559" style="s2">here&#39;s what could happen and here&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.739" end="00:55:58.089" style="s2">potentialities are there and and in a</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.559" end="00:56:02.139" style="s2">few months it&#39;s just gonna close down</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.089" end="00:56:04.269" style="s2">again on some level and then at that</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.139" end="00:56:07.319" style="s2">point we&#39;re going to have to keep</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.269" end="00:56:10.709" style="s2">whatever we&#39;ve learned in this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.319" end="00:56:14.799" style="s2">you know and from this situation and and</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.709" end="00:56:16.569" style="s2">that will be like this is like a retreat</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.799" end="00:56:18.189" style="s2">or something you know I&#39;ve done Buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.569" end="00:56:20.169" style="s2">meditation for a long time it&#39;s a bit</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.189" end="00:56:23.349" style="s2">like that you go into you go in you go</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.169" end="00:56:26.619" style="s2">out into a place you go out you go away</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.349" end="00:56:28.509" style="s2">from the world for a while and and then</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.619" end="00:56:29.529" style="s2">you come back changed even though things</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.509" end="00:56:31.359" style="s2">are the same and when you go back</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.529" end="00:56:36.699" style="s2">everything&#39;s a shock and everything&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.359" end="00:56:38.799" style="s2">kind of hard to to navigate and then you</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.699" end="00:56:43.109" style="s2">realize maybe a few years later that</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.799" end="00:56:46.509" style="s2">that that you&#39;ve maybe learn something</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.109" end="00:56:48.429" style="s2">yeah I keep feeling that that it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.509" end="00:56:51.579" style="s2">of those moments that maybe is something</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.429" end="00:56:56.349" style="s2">like when you&#39;re on a boat and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.579" end="00:56:58.359" style="s2">leaving and headed out to sea and you</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.349" end="00:57:00.939" style="s2">can still see the land</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.359" end="00:57:02.829" style="s2">I think right now we can still see the</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.939" end="00:57:04.779" style="s2">land Oh</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.829" end="00:57:06.219" style="s2">maybe yeah that&#39;s the other thing as</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.779" end="00:57:10.059" style="s2">maybe things are just gonna get really</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.219" end="00:57:15.039" style="s2">weird just just completely weird maybe</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.059" end="00:57:16.839" style="s2">things are just gonna go so I you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.039" end="00:57:18.999" style="s2">anything&#39;s possible right now we could</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.839" end="00:57:21.400" style="s2">go back to the land we could go out to</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.999" end="00:57:24.099" style="s2">sea we could find a new island we could</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.400" end="00:57:25.749" style="s2">good you know we could with anything&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.099" end="00:57:29.920" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.749" end="00:57:33.699" style="s2">and but I think it has to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.920" end="00:57:35.650" style="s2">details right back to the yeah back to</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.699" end="00:57:39.130" style="s2">the relationship between complexity and</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.650" end="00:57:42.939" style="s2">details so you know what are the ways in</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.130" end="00:57:47.949" style="s2">which scientific research is actually</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.939" end="00:57:52.390" style="s2">being strangled by culture that&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.949" end="00:57:53.769" style="s2">question can you elaborate I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.390" end="00:58:01.349" style="s2">if I understand what you mean by that</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.769" end="00:58:06.640" style="s2">well okay it&#39;s a it&#39;s a complex question</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.349" end="00:58:08.859" style="s2">because there&#39;s a of course right now</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.640" end="00:58:10.509" style="s2">we&#39;re in this moment and hopefully we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.859" end="00:58:13.929" style="s2">look back on this tape and say remember</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.509" end="00:58:16.299" style="s2">how stupid we all were we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.929" end="00:58:17.859" style="s2">people don&#39;t can&#39;t really get medical</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.299" end="00:58:22.390" style="s2">attention until they&#39;re in critical</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.859" end="00:58:24.579" style="s2">condition yeah okay the the basic</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.390" end="00:58:27.219" style="s2">approach at this point is still the</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.579" end="00:58:28.959" style="s2">ventilators there&#39;s not enough</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.219" end="00:58:35.349" style="s2">billionaires are going out buying their</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.959" end="00:58:37.839" style="s2">own ventilator good for them yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.349" end="00:58:40.449" style="s2">at least someone will be safe but the</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.839" end="00:58:42.339" style="s2">ventilator is not a solution I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.449" end="00:58:45.519" style="s2">know if you know anybody who&#39;s come out</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.339" end="00:58:49.089" style="s2">of intubation but I heard some horror</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.519" end="00:58:50.920" style="s2">stories not pretty and it&#39;s years of you</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.089" end="00:58:54.519" style="s2">know rehabilitation coming</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.920" end="00:58:58.390" style="s2">so clearly the ventilator cannot be the</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.519" end="00:59:01.359" style="s2">solution and there&#39;s you know what what</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.390" end="00:59:05.049" style="s2">about early treatment what about you</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.359" end="00:59:07.599" style="s2">know what what is is are there are there</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.049" end="00:59:10.989" style="s2">in the immunities or are there not this</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.599" end="00:59:12.110" style="s2">is an unknown question how but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.989" end="00:59:15.410" style="s2">also in</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.110" end="00:59:19.850" style="s2">in a culture and in a in a moment where</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.410" end="00:59:22.640" style="s2">the economics and the cultural and the</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.850" end="00:59:25.550" style="s2">media and all of these things have</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.640" end="00:59:27.740" style="s2">formed this kind of perfect storm yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.550" end="00:59:30.530" style="s2">nobody believes anything that comes from</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.740" end="00:59:32.240" style="s2">anywhere anymore right we don&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.530" end="00:59:34.880" style="s2">the pharmaceutical companies because we</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.240" end="00:59:37.220" style="s2">know they lie we don&#39;t believe the the</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.880" end="00:59:39.260" style="s2">New Agers and the alternative medicines</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.220" end="00:59:42.740" style="s2">because they&#39;ve been lying we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.260" end="00:59:45.290" style="s2">believe the politicians because they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.740" end="00:59:51.260" style="s2">say anything just everybody&#39;s been lying</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.290" end="00:59:53.870" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah so actually how do we</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.260" end="00:59:56.720" style="s2">retrieve how is it possible to retrieve</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.870" end="00:59:59.690" style="s2">the integrity of scientific research in</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.720" end="01:00:02.800" style="s2">the field because there&#39;s no time for</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.690" end="01:00:08.780" style="s2">years and years of clinical studies to</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.800" end="01:00:13.250" style="s2">so how what what on this in this moment</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.780" end="01:00:20.360" style="s2">what would make you trust or feel that</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.250" end="01:00:22.640" style="s2">it was feasible to get behind well I</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.360" end="01:00:24.890" style="s2">mean it&#39;s a question of also of personal</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.640" end="01:00:28.340" style="s2">responsibility as well as like taking</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.890" end="01:00:30.290" style="s2">care of your your health because if</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.340" end="01:00:31.910" style="s2">you&#39;re just eating a lot of bad food and</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.290" end="01:00:35.900" style="s2">and you know you know overworking</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.910" end="01:00:37.400" style="s2">yourself and being burnt out and your</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.900" end="01:00:39.380" style="s2">immune system is going to be weak and</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.400" end="01:00:44.570" style="s2">you know we&#39;re you know this is all sort</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.380" end="01:00:46.880" style="s2">of I don&#39;t know though because you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.570" end="01:00:48.800" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of people who are that are</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.880" end="01:00:53.480" style="s2">people that I know that have been really</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.800" end="01:00:58.040" style="s2">healthy sure yeah okay I see what you</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.480" end="01:01:00.680" style="s2">mean yeah that&#39;s taking I&#39;m taking out</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.040" end="01:01:03.320" style="s2">of just a personal tragedy element of</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.680" end="01:01:06.440" style="s2">the thing but I&#39;m saying again it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.320" end="01:01:09.320" style="s2">a question of looking at the system and</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.440" end="01:01:12.820" style="s2">seeing how the systems are are bad like</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.320" end="01:01:16.600" style="s2">that the health system you know and</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.820" end="01:01:19.100" style="s2">bringing it to a more local kind of</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.600" end="01:01:21.920" style="s2">understanding I mean the health system</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.100" end="01:01:24.800" style="s2">has created a completely reductionist</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.920" end="01:01:29.210" style="s2">idea of health yeah exactly right</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.800" end="01:01:32.630" style="s2">so that is a deeply decades built-in</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.210" end="01:01:34.370" style="s2">disaster so you know this your lung</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.630" end="01:01:36.140" style="s2">health is separate from your eye health</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.370" end="01:01:37.760" style="s2">is separate from your I mean dentistry</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.140" end="01:01:40.190" style="s2">is not even part of the doctor&#39;s office</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.760" end="01:01:42.800" style="s2">and clearly my teeth are part of my body</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.190" end="01:01:45.260" style="s2">so you know there&#39;s this this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.800" end="01:01:49.520" style="s2">separation that&#39;s been developed in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.260" end="01:01:51.710" style="s2">health sciences and then you add that to</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.520" end="01:01:54.800" style="s2">the kind of reductionism that has taken</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.710" end="01:01:58.870" style="s2">place in the marketplace around what it</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.800" end="01:02:01.910" style="s2">is to have a viable medicine for sale</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.870" end="01:02:05.240" style="s2">and what it is that how that then got</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.910" end="01:02:07.910" style="s2">ported into the research facilities and</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.240" end="01:02:09.680" style="s2">the universities and the universities</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.910" end="01:02:12.200" style="s2">are really only able to look at one</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.680" end="01:02:13.910" style="s2">context or one discipline at a time so</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.200" end="01:02:17.390" style="s2">they couldn&#39;t get the trans contextual</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.910" end="01:02:19.670" style="s2">information if they wanted to and so you</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.390" end="01:02:23.000" style="s2">know meanwhile all of this has been</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.670" end="01:02:26.150" style="s2">building for years and in and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.000" end="01:02:30.230" style="s2">part of why I think there is so much</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.150" end="01:02:32.450" style="s2">distrust in in the media in the</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.230" end="01:02:34.880" style="s2">journalism in the information because</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.450" end="01:02:37.310" style="s2">it&#39;s it doesn&#39;t have the context it</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.880" end="01:02:42.350" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have you know the question is</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.310" end="01:02:44.440" style="s2">not is this a proven solution the</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.350" end="01:02:45.650" style="s2">question is who paid for the research</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.440" end="01:02:47.870" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.650" end="01:02:50.390" style="s2">where was it done what questions did</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.870" end="01:02:51.590" style="s2">they ask how much contact was there they</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.390" end="01:02:54.020" style="s2">had an agenda</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.590" end="01:02:57.110" style="s2">yeah and how much money are they earning</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.020" end="01:03:00.440" style="s2">how much money you know from from</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.110" end="01:03:04.070" style="s2">selling ritalin to to children or</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.440" end="01:03:08.780" style="s2">whatever or whatever so this is I think</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.070" end="01:03:12.410" style="s2">the the kind of the puzzle of this</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.780" end="01:03:14.900" style="s2">moment is we&#39;re back to the question at</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.410" end="01:03:17.690" style="s2">the beginning what what is information</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.900" end="01:03:22.160" style="s2">Rebecca complexity again huh yeah how do</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.690" end="01:03:27.530" style="s2">we know what information is in a coma</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.160" end="01:03:31.730" style="s2">system hmm because it&#39;s a slippery</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.530" end="01:03:33.740" style="s2">question right right and often we think</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.730" end="01:03:37.040" style="s2">of information in terms of you know in a</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.740" end="01:03:38.299" style="s2">very new Merkle as you say cold data and</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.040" end="01:03:41.359" style="s2">warm data</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.299" end="01:03:44.539" style="s2">we look at the cold data or we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.359" end="01:03:47.929" style="s2">even I don&#39;t think said it would be</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.539" end="01:03:50.479" style="s2">possible from looking at your let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.929" end="01:03:51.769" style="s2">we were gonna do an analysis of you</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.479" end="01:03:54.920" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.769" end="01:04:00.920" style="s2">and let&#39;s say six weeks ago we looked at</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.920" end="01:04:04.849" style="s2">your economic your microbiome your I</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.920" end="01:04:10.969" style="s2">don&#39;t know your time spent at home your</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.849" end="01:04:16.160" style="s2">your age your blood your heritage your</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.969" end="01:04:18.380" style="s2">DNA your culture how much you read what</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.160" end="01:04:21.140" style="s2">degrees you have what other things</p>

<p begin="01:04:41.929" end="01:04:49.400" style="s2">this is a really tricky moment because</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.979" end="01:04:53.599" style="s2">the question of how to actually bring</p>

<p begin="01:05:05.539" end="01:05:10.849" style="s2">always so surprising is just how how</p>

<p begin="01:05:49.670" end="01:05:53.640" style="s2">you&#39;ve said opportunity a lot but you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.140" end="01:05:56.119" style="s2">also said that you don&#39;t like the idea</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.640" end="01:06:00.599" style="s2">of thinking too much in opportunistic</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.119" end="01:06:04.410" style="s2">terms right I don&#39;t like the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.599" end="01:06:07.940" style="s2">flat and sterile Victor&#39;s of vision that</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.410" end="01:06:10.710" style="s2">the notion of opportunity can create</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.940" end="01:06:12.450" style="s2">right if I say what&#39;s the opportunity</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.710" end="01:06:14.759" style="s2">and we&#39;d say we could learn to think in</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.450" end="01:06:17.609" style="s2">terms of inter dependency that becomes</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.759" end="01:06:20.339" style="s2">an abstraction comes blah blah yes sure</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.609" end="01:06:23.519" style="s2">great so that&#39;s where I feel like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.339" end="01:06:26.539" style="s2">important to watch out and that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.519" end="01:06:29.029" style="s2">the arts okay back to the arts so</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.539" end="01:06:32.039" style="s2">occasionally you get these fantastic</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.029" end="01:06:37.289" style="s2">sci-fi writers who can really bring</p>

<p begin="01:06:39.900" end="01:06:49.670" style="s2">very dystopian but but it&#39;s those</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.140" end="01:06:52.489" style="s2">details that most of the visioning lack</p>

<p begin="01:06:52.489" end="01:07:01.470" style="s2">right so that&#39;s why opportunity can be a</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.359" end="01:07:04.249" style="s2">really it&#39;s a to say that can be an</p>

<p begin="01:07:04.249" end="01:07:09.839" style="s2">mm-hmm incomplete a lot of</p>

<p begin="01:07:09.839" end="01:07:13.319" style="s2">you were saying about the science</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.829" end="01:07:16.230" style="s2">fiction writers is is that you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.319" end="01:07:18.420" style="s2">they&#39;re able to take this intuitive leap</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.230" end="01:07:20.009" style="s2">probably right that if you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.420" end="01:07:23.279" style="s2">thinking in empirical terms or</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.009" end="01:07:26.700" style="s2">scientific terms you might get stuck in</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.279" end="01:07:30.480" style="s2">the you might get stuck in and you might</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.700" end="01:07:32.339" style="s2">get a combinatorial explosion you have</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.480" end="01:07:34.499" style="s2">too many options and too many ideas and</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.339" end="01:07:37.079" style="s2">too much abstraction and but but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.499" end="01:07:38.309" style="s2">just the the imaginative leap or</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.079" end="01:07:43.470" style="s2">something it that&#39;s what that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.309" end="01:07:45.119" style="s2">creative people can can do or that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.470" end="01:07:46.739" style="s2">maybe maybe that&#39;s what education should</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.119" end="01:07:49.859" style="s2">be that&#39;s what we should be trying to</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.739" end="01:07:51.660" style="s2">teach people on some level is is to</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.859" end="01:07:54.749" style="s2">combine like let&#39;s say as you say that</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.660" end="01:07:58.009" style="s2">the details and the context and being</p>

<p begin="01:07:59.050" end="01:08:16.640" style="s2">the richness that multi-sensorial</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.560" end="01:08:19.040" style="s2">attention mm-hmm right right so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.640" end="01:08:21.589" style="s2">why you know that one of the problems</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.040" end="01:08:24.530" style="s2">with opportunity is that it it brings a</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.589" end="01:08:26.299" style="s2">kind of flat positivity with it it</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.530" end="01:08:28.310" style="s2">brings an instrumentalization or</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.299" end="01:08:32.270" style="s2">something or a very left brain kind of</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.310" end="01:08:37.000" style="s2">like you know it doesn&#39;t trying to get</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.270" end="01:08:41.720" style="s2">something out of it or yeah link to to</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.000" end="01:08:44.540" style="s2">reductively here or just not wanting to</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.720" end="01:08:46.100" style="s2">feel the pain again you know if you if</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.540" end="01:08:47.569" style="s2">you&#39;re but we have to focus on the</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.100" end="01:08:50.690" style="s2">opportunities we have to think what</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.569" end="01:08:53.960" style="s2">could what we could possibly do with</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.690" end="01:08:55.940" style="s2">this experience yeah you know and at the</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.960" end="01:09:03.080" style="s2">same time it&#39;s like yeah and I actually</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.940" end="01:09:07.839" style="s2">need to feel the fury and the grief at</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.080" end="01:09:10.700" style="s2">the same time of you know people who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.839" end="01:09:13.549" style="s2">who are having to be on the other side</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.700" end="01:09:16.339" style="s2">of decision-making that says you&#39;re your</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.549" end="01:09:19.940" style="s2">person is not getting care this other</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.339" end="01:09:23.030" style="s2">person is getting care mm-hmm yeah</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.940" end="01:09:24.650" style="s2">that&#39;s a whole mass that if I just turn</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.030" end="01:09:26.210" style="s2">my back on that and think I&#39;m just gonna</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.650" end="01:09:29.180" style="s2">think about the positive side of this</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.210" end="01:09:32.000" style="s2">bill is terrible painful then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.180" end="01:09:35.000" style="s2">numbness that is not able to inform in</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.000" end="01:09:38.060" style="s2">the way that that sci-fi artistry and</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.000" end="01:09:42.020" style="s2">imagination needs to have that</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.060" end="01:09:45.200" style="s2">multi-sensorial mm-hmm formation and I</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.020" end="01:09:46.970" style="s2">also integration of the darker side of</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.200" end="01:09:48.799" style="s2">how you know what when you were saying</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.970" end="01:09:50.510" style="s2">that I was thinking like you think of</p>

<p begin="01:09:53.720" end="01:09:58.160" style="s2">Cavalier kind of way and I was thinking</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.450" end="01:09:59.930" style="s2">you would feel if that if you were in</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.160" end="01:10:01.380" style="s2">that situation you would feel murderous</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.930" end="01:10:04.680" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.380" end="01:10:06.450" style="s2">I mean when you don&#39;t know the rage you</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.680" end="01:10:08.190" style="s2">want would want to feel you would want</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.450" end="01:10:11.760" style="s2">to you know if somebody was doing that</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.190" end="01:10:14.370" style="s2">to somebody you love you could easily</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.760" end="01:10:19.110" style="s2">feel violence to a lot of violence you</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.370" end="01:10:20.670" style="s2">know inside yourself and I think we want</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.110" end="01:10:22.440" style="s2">to live in this safe abstraction all the</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.670" end="01:10:27.080" style="s2">time and not realize that we have those</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.440" end="01:10:29.910" style="s2">deeper darker kind of you know feelings</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.080" end="01:10:33.000" style="s2">you know what it is andrew is that</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.910" end="01:10:38.210" style="s2">there&#39;s I think it&#39;s a really pernicious</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.000" end="01:10:42.720" style="s2">habit there&#39;s this utilities ation of</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.210" end="01:10:44.460" style="s2">emotion and people will say there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.720" end="01:10:46.110" style="s2">point in getting angry about this</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.460" end="01:10:50.370" style="s2">because there&#39;s nothing you can do about</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.110" end="01:10:52.650" style="s2">it oh yeah yeah okay there&#39;s no point in</p>

<p begin="01:12:14.620" end="01:12:19.840" style="s2">you&#39;re projecting some future that you</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.160" end="01:12:23.980" style="s2">and but not being in relation to the</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.840" end="01:12:27.150" style="s2">present or your your you&#39;re dwelling in</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.980" end="01:12:29.800" style="s2">how dark you know everything can be or</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.150" end="01:12:34.750" style="s2">and you&#39;re not seeing that as you say</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.800" end="01:12:37.210" style="s2">they&#39;re the richness of you know even</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.750" end="01:12:38.500" style="s2">though of both like the fact that there</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.210" end="01:12:40.180" style="s2">were life and death are kind of</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.500" end="01:12:44.170" style="s2">happening simultaneously around you</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.180" end="01:12:46.390" style="s2">there&#39;s this possibility and also also</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.170" end="01:12:50.440" style="s2">some when there&#39;s one possibility arises</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.390" end="01:12:52.510" style="s2">another thing disappears and in the</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.440" end="01:12:55.870" style="s2">meantime you have to keep asking the</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.510" end="01:12:58.960" style="s2">question Who am I mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.870" end="01:13:01.840" style="s2">right and so the this whole utilitarian</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.960" end="01:13:06.670" style="s2">version of what emotions you&#39;re allowing</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.840" end="01:13:08.500" style="s2">to guide you or inform you is a disaster</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.670" end="01:13:12.880" style="s2">because in the mean time you need to</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.500" end="01:13:15.010" style="s2">keep thinking who am i right that those</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.880" end="01:13:18.930" style="s2">nurses that are in that predicament are</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.010" end="01:13:22.740" style="s2">asking hard questions Who am I mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.930" end="01:13:25.390" style="s2">and if you can&#39;t ask that question</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.740" end="01:13:29.340" style="s2">because you can&#39;t feel the pain or</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.390" end="01:13:32.230" style="s2">you&#39;ve shut out the possibility of that</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.340" end="01:13:36.460" style="s2">developmental process because it was too</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.230" end="01:13:41.260" style="s2">stretchy it was too painful then were in</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.460" end="01:13:44.890" style="s2">trouble so my question then is how do we</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.260" end="01:13:49.740" style="s2">support each other through this process</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.890" end="01:13:49.740" style="s2">in a way that doesn&#39;t dull our senses</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.310" end="01:14:00.550" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s the I have a little puppy</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.660" end="01:14:02.170" style="s2">yeah I just got this little puppy which</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.550" end="01:14:04.360" style="s2">is why I missed our thing yesterday</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.170" end="01:14:08.470" style="s2">because I completely got puppy brain and</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.360" end="01:14:11.020" style="s2">lost my mind but my puppy was out</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.470" end="01:14:14.560" style="s2">yesterday and just eating all sorts of</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.020" end="01:14:18.420" style="s2">dirt and rocks and grass and no doing</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.560" end="01:14:21.130" style="s2">research right and then vomiting</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.420" end="01:14:23.950" style="s2">rocks and grass all over my kitchen</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.130" end="01:14:25.960" style="s2">floor yeah in the city they would eat</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.950" end="01:14:27.580" style="s2">chewing gum and cigarette butts and</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.960" end="01:14:32.290" style="s2">practically everything that</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.580" end="01:14:34.750" style="s2">as on the sidewalk right yeah no if I</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.290" end="01:14:40.150" style="s2">don&#39;t allow my puppy to eat dirt and</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.750" end="01:14:43.690" style="s2">rocks and grass hmm there&#39;s some you</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.150" end="01:14:47.920" style="s2">won&#39;t puke on my floor mm-hmm it will</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.690" end="01:14:54.400" style="s2">have been very efficient but there won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.920" end="01:14:58.870" style="s2">be the knowing right and so I you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.400" end="01:15:02.260" style="s2">the it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a big it&#39;s a big it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.870" end="01:15:06.670" style="s2">a big question and particularly when</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.260" end="01:15:11.640" style="s2">we&#39;re adding this to societies of people</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.670" end="01:15:15.100" style="s2">who are already dealing with levels of</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.640" end="01:15:19.660" style="s2">depression and brokenness and anxiety</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.100" end="01:15:25.510" style="s2">and and then we throw this in as a as a</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.660" end="01:15:31.840" style="s2">as a crack in the matrix glass mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.510" end="01:15:33.940" style="s2">and and anyone well I guess Geiger Jeff</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.840" end="01:15:35.770" style="s2">said there&#39;s conscious suffering and</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.940" end="01:15:40.840" style="s2">then there&#39;s just unconscious suffering</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.770" end="01:15:45.340" style="s2">so well it&#39;s been forced upon us so you</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.840" end="01:15:47.410" style="s2">know it happened and it it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.340" end="01:15:50.710" style="s2">continue to happen probably for a while</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.410" end="01:15:53.740" style="s2">because the fallout from the various</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.710" end="01:15:57.370" style="s2">things that have changed will continue</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.740" end="01:16:00.700" style="s2">though I&#39;m quite sure technologically</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.370" end="01:16:04.060" style="s2">economically and how many people&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.700" end="01:16:08.260" style="s2">heard a story last night of this this</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.060" end="01:16:13.150" style="s2">one couple who two hours before the</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.260" end="01:16:16.510" style="s2">lockdown the the one partner said to the</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.150" end="01:16:18.760" style="s2">other one I want a divorce and hours</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.510" end="01:16:20.350" style="s2">later they went into lockdown together</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.760" end="01:16:23.290" style="s2">and they&#39;ve been in lockdown for three</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.350" end="01:16:25.630" style="s2">weeks stuck in the same house and yeah</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.290" end="01:16:27.880" style="s2">did they work it out or did they decide</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.630" end="01:16:32.520" style="s2">they still wanted a divorce her I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.880" end="01:16:35.560" style="s2">know yet but there&#39;s other people who</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.520" end="01:16:36.730" style="s2">may have been thinking about it who then</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.560" end="01:16:38.500" style="s2">find each other again</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.730" end="01:16:39.820" style="s2">or people who thought they had a happy</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.500" end="01:16:41.740" style="s2">marriage and then they were</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.820" end="01:16:42.880" style="s2">actually this was really working great</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.740" end="01:16:47.080" style="s2">when I didn&#39;t have to spend any time</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.880" end="01:16:49.990" style="s2">with you yeah so and there&#39;s a of course</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.080" end="01:16:54.160" style="s2">an enormous spike of domestic abuse yeah</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.990" end="01:16:55.750" style="s2">god no it&#39;s just it&#39;s just anything it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.160" end="01:16:59.910" style="s2">it&#39;s everywhere</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.750" end="01:16:59.910" style="s2">it&#39;s in every direction and I think that</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.320" end="01:17:16.020" style="s2">the the need is to try to think about it</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.260" end="01:17:19.450" style="s2">all at once and to try to to develop the</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.020" end="01:17:22.390" style="s2">possibility to see and to feel and to</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.450" end="01:17:26.280" style="s2">sense and to to recognize that</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.390" end="01:17:27.460" style="s2">complexity in every moment mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.280" end="01:17:30.490" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.460" end="01:17:38.800" style="s2">so in other words don&#39;t get stuck in one</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.490" end="01:17:41.320" style="s2">area of the problem or just just always</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.800" end="01:17:46.170" style="s2">to be kind of not not to lose sight of</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.320" end="01:17:48.760" style="s2">the did the global the total the overall</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.170" end="01:17:51.370" style="s2">context is that what you&#39;re saying yeah</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.760" end="01:17:53.320" style="s2">keep turning it how does this look from</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.370" end="01:17:55.060" style="s2">my food perspective how does this look</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.320" end="01:17:58.960" style="s2">from my kids perspective how does this</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.060" end="01:18:01.060" style="s2">look from the perspective of people in</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.960" end="01:18:02.800" style="s2">other countries how does this look from</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.060" end="01:18:04.810" style="s2">the perspective of people in other</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.800" end="01:18:07.780" style="s2">economic positions how does this look</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.810" end="01:18:11.820" style="s2">from the perspective of my education</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.780" end="01:18:16.480" style="s2">like what what good is my work now</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.820" end="01:18:18.880" style="s2">what&#39;s essential hmm yeah what do I</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.480" end="01:18:20.650" style="s2">actually have to offer now because I</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.880" end="01:18:22.840" style="s2">think a lot of people are gonna come out</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.650" end="01:18:26.940" style="s2">the other side of this realizing that so</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.840" end="01:18:29.460" style="s2">much of what they have been able to give</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.940" end="01:18:33.430" style="s2">really need it anymore</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.460" end="01:18:34.810" style="s2">hmm and other people might find that</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.430" end="01:18:38.200" style="s2">something essential that they had</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.810" end="01:18:40.090" style="s2">forgotten or exactly uh-huh I know like</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.200" end="01:18:42.220" style="s2">I was thinking about my own music right</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.090" end="01:18:48.910" style="s2">and I for I&#39;ve been playing music for a</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.220" end="01:18:50.320" style="s2">long time and and I kind of let it slide</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.910" end="01:18:52.110" style="s2">over the past few years just because</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.320" end="01:18:54.330" style="s2">I&#39;ve had a family and I&#39;ve been working</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.110" end="01:18:56.940" style="s2">very hard and and I&#39;ve been doing</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.330" end="01:19:01.290" style="s2">podcasts and writing and and all these</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.940" end="01:19:03.869" style="s2">other things and somehow somehow I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.290" end="01:19:05.730" style="s2">come back to music during the past three</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.869" end="01:19:09.929" style="s2">weeks I think that&#39;s kind of interesting</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.730" end="01:19:12.300" style="s2">I think of other people who might be</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.929" end="01:19:17.790" style="s2">finding something that they had they had</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.300" end="01:19:20.630" style="s2">neglected in their lives and discovering</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.790" end="01:19:26.840" style="s2">how necessary and important that is for</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.630" end="01:19:29.610" style="s2">them I have found that absolutely and I</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.840" end="01:19:34.320" style="s2">think I think a lot of people are</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.610" end="01:19:38.850" style="s2">finding that suddenly we&#39;re doing very</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.320" end="01:19:43.050" style="s2">different things with our time but I</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.850" end="01:19:44.969" style="s2">also have to say that I have people who</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.050" end="01:19:47.520" style="s2">are close to me who have been intubated</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.969" end="01:19:49.800" style="s2">and who have actually been through this</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.520" end="01:19:51.690" style="s2">and people who are you know doctors and</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.800" end="01:19:53.010" style="s2">scientists and things on the front line</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.690" end="01:20:01.080" style="s2">trying to work this out</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.010" end="01:20:03.330" style="s2">mmm find new ways through and the</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.080" end="01:20:05.280" style="s2">experience of the comfortable people at</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.330" end="01:20:14.000" style="s2">home who are having a little existential</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.280" end="01:20:14.000" style="s2">quandary can really come off as well</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.600" end="01:20:23.580" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s responsible of me to say that</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.880" end="01:20:26.489" style="s2">and not say oh yes but my my neighbor</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.580" end="01:20:29.369" style="s2">had a stroke and it&#39;s she&#39;s 80 years old</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.489" end="01:20:31.980" style="s2">and she&#39;s afraid and she can&#39;t see her</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.369" end="01:20:36.150" style="s2">grandchildren and you know I have to say</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.980" end="01:20:38.369" style="s2">that side - I can&#39;t just talk about I I</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.150" end="01:20:41.960" style="s2">mean I think if there&#39;s gonna be an</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.369" end="01:20:48.810" style="s2">existential question it needs to include</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.960" end="01:20:52.380" style="s2">the hard stuff certainly and that um the</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.810" end="01:20:55.739" style="s2">recognition that you and I are healthy</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.380" end="01:21:00.300" style="s2">today we can have this</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.739" end="01:21:03.840" style="s2">conversation mm-hmm and there&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.300" end="01:21:05.460" style="s2">like this virus is going to go back away</p>
