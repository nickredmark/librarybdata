<p begin="00:00:03.870" end="00:00:09.929" style="s2">economy I think I love so much of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.770" end="00:00:13.679" style="s2">sharing economy I love things that were</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.929" end="00:00:18.990" style="s2">around before the term was coined like</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.679" end="00:00:20.310" style="s2">libraries love libraries I also think</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.990" end="00:00:23.910" style="s2">that the sharing economy has been</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.310" end="00:00:27.480" style="s2">co-opted by capitalism that platforms</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.910" end="00:00:28.949" style="s2">like Airbnb and uber try to tug at our</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.480" end="00:00:30.779" style="s2">heartstrings like look we&#39;re using less</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.949" end="00:00:32.579" style="s2">resources and the truth is they are they</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.779" end="00:00:34.559" style="s2">are but they&#39;re not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.579" end="00:00:37.200" style="s2">listening to the people using those</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.559" end="00:00:39.719" style="s2">resources and making it not empowering</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.200" end="00:00:43.739" style="s2">the individual and why would they there</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.719" end="00:00:46.500" style="s2">gave me they are the old paradigm but we</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.739" end="00:00:49.890" style="s2">can create the platforms that help us</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.500" end="00:00:51.989" style="s2">create a real honest sharing economy or</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.890" end="00:00:54.780" style="s2">were sharing in resources we&#39;re creating</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.989" end="00:00:57.570" style="s2">the libraries of everything including</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.780" end="00:01:00.750" style="s2">knowledge including 3d knowledge so you</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.570" end="00:01:03.300" style="s2">can print your own things and including</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.750" end="00:01:06.060" style="s2">the platforms to share in labor like</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.300" end="00:01:08.220" style="s2">what uber does but make it so that it is</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.060" end="00:01:10.650" style="s2">asking the people doing the labor how do</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.220" end="00:01:13.110" style="s2">we make this easier for you how do we</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.650" end="00:01:15.330" style="s2">make it give you more of an incentive</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.110" end="00:01:18.060" style="s2">without necessarily increasing them on</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.330" end="00:01:21.000" style="s2">the monetary contribution of the people</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.060" end="00:01:22.830" style="s2">using your labor in the instance of our</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.000" end="00:01:25.409" style="s2">version of uber that would be oh you</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.830" end="00:01:27.979" style="s2">have mileage on your car you have you</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.409" end="00:01:30.150" style="s2">hated you need car insurance you need in</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.979" end="00:01:33.840" style="s2">cities and spaces where it&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.150" end="00:01:35.700" style="s2">doing cooperatively owned like buying a</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.840" end="00:01:37.200" style="s2">bulk package of car insurance having</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.700" end="00:01:43.439" style="s2">mechanic shops that you can bring your</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.200" end="00:01:45.360" style="s2">car into the services at cost bulk</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.439" end="00:01:47.340" style="s2">buying gas if that&#39;s an option like</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.360" end="00:01:49.950" style="s2">looking up ways to make it cheaper and</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.340" end="00:01:52.770" style="s2">cheaper getting health insurance for for</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.950" end="00:01:54.600" style="s2">the drivers because uber saves a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.770" end="00:01:58.920" style="s2">money by making them contract workers</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.600" end="00:02:04.439" style="s2">and we can basically unionize our labor</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.920" end="00:02:07.110" style="s2">force without that tension between</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.439" end="00:02:09.479" style="s2">unions and managers we are sitting down</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.110" end="00:02:11.819" style="s2">and having a conversation of what makes</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.479" end="00:02:13.530" style="s2">this meaningful work to you what would</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.819" end="00:02:15.480" style="s2">make you want to drive more</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.530" end="00:02:18.120" style="s2">and of course part of that it&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.480" end="00:02:21.150" style="s2">monetary compensation they&#39;re not doing</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.120" end="00:02:23.040" style="s2">it just for the fun of it mostly and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.150" end="00:02:24.900" style="s2">and how do we also listen to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.040" end="00:02:27.840" style="s2">passengers and say what would make this</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.900" end="00:02:29.550" style="s2">better for you pain less money okay how</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.840" end="00:02:31.140" style="s2">can we make it so the drivers make more</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.550" end="00:02:33.810" style="s2">money and the passengers make less money</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.140" end="00:02:37.260" style="s2">we can co-create that together with</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.810" end="00:02:39.180" style="s2">ride-sharing with in contributing our</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.260" end="00:02:41.180" style="s2">data so we can find better paths that</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.180" end="00:02:44.459" style="s2">the vehicles can take taking more people</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.180" end="00:02:46.410" style="s2">that that also honor that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.459" end="00:02:49.680" style="s2">public transit that it&#39;s not like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.410" end="00:02:51.680" style="s2">going from point A to point B we could</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.680" end="00:02:54.330" style="s2">just do more you can do more together</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.680" end="00:02:56.670" style="s2">creating a sharing economy in</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.330" end="00:02:58.950" style="s2">information that we have access to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.670" end="00:03:00.900" style="s2">same information so we can build the</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.950" end="00:03:02.100" style="s2">foundations on that that&#39;s a little more</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.900" end="00:03:06.480" style="s2">of a stretch the sharing economy would</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.100" end="00:03:09.450" style="s2">be kind of I got and sharing in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.480" end="00:03:11.580" style="s2">people that we get to create the</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.450" end="00:03:13.170" style="s2">connections that we want to have access</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.580" end="00:03:15.450" style="s2">to if there are projects you would love</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.170" end="00:03:17.790" style="s2">to work on whether that&#39;s music or</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.450" end="00:03:19.980" style="s2">science or discovery being able to find</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.790" end="00:03:21.900" style="s2">your people we can create the platforms</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.980" end="00:03:24.209" style="s2">for all of that we&#39;re gonna create the</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.900" end="00:03:26.790" style="s2">platform and those platforms can work</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.209" end="00:03:30.120" style="s2">together so that when one is created</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.790" end="00:03:32.400" style="s2">whether through us or somebody else we</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.120" end="00:03:36.570" style="s2">can get people to it is it a platform we</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.400" end="00:03:38.970" style="s2">want to exist in the world let&#39;s get</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.570" end="00:03:41.310" style="s2">people to that platform if it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.970" end="00:03:43.470" style="s2">platform we want to create it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.310" end="00:03:45.329" style="s2">exist in the world how do we create it</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.470" end="00:03:47.609" style="s2">and then how do we constantly be looking</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.329" end="00:03:49.140" style="s2">for ways to improve it and empower</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.609" end="00:03:51.780" style="s2">people to bring their voice to that</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.140" end="00:03:54.630" style="s2">process how do we make the entire thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.780" end="00:03:56.820" style="s2">fun and simple so that people want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.630" end="00:03:58.769" style="s2">look for ways to collaborate and want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.820" end="00:04:01.829" style="s2">be part of collaboration that&#39;s how we</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.769" end="00:04:06.239" style="s2">create win-win scenarios when we look at</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.829" end="00:04:09.329" style="s2">a new paradigm of every new person is in</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.239" end="00:04:11.970" style="s2">addition to the to the intellect</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.329" end="00:04:14.400" style="s2">intellectual intellectual interweb to</p>

<p begin="00:04:14.400" end="00:04:19.079" style="s2">have all of those nodes connected brings</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.459" end="00:04:22.109" style="s2">every time someone new comes on it</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.079" end="00:04:24.450" style="s2">brings more power unlike uber because at</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.109" end="00:04:27.150" style="s2">uber a new driver coming on means that</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.450" end="00:04:29.210" style="s2">there&#39;s more supply and there</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.150" end="00:04:31.830" style="s2">or the drivers are gonna make less</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.210" end="00:04:34.050" style="s2">creating more drivers means that we have</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.830" end="00:04:36.720" style="s2">more nodes more people to say what is</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.050" end="00:04:40.050" style="s2">going to work and not work and to</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.720" end="00:04:42.120" style="s2">constantly be asking what would make it</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.050" end="00:04:44.370" style="s2">better for both parties</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.120" end="00:04:46.590" style="s2">while not necessarily making it an</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.370" end="00:04:49.110" style="s2">increase in the dollar amount from the</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.590" end="00:04:51.020" style="s2">passenger to a dollar amount increase</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.110" end="00:04:53.540" style="s2">for the for the driver there are ways to</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.020" end="00:04:56.400" style="s2">exponentially grow our value without</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.540" end="00:04:59.100" style="s2">needing an increase in hourly wage and</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.400" end="00:05:02.490" style="s2">together we can find those ways and</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.100" end="00:05:04.260" style="s2">co-create them so how well I did not</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.490" end="00:05:06.690" style="s2">explain the shared economy but this</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.260" end="00:05:08.850" style="s2">video was a response to a comment on one</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.690" end="00:05:10.500" style="s2">of my previous videos someone talking</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.850" end="00:05:12.449" style="s2">about the sharing economy and the issues</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.500" end="00:05:15.479" style="s2">in it and yes there are a lot of issues</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.449" end="00:05:17.880" style="s2">in the sharing economy and when we</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.479" end="00:05:20.699" style="s2">co-create it together we can minimize</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.880" end="00:05:22.590" style="s2">the issues and maximize the reward and</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.699" end="00:05:24.750" style="s2">the potential for environment for less</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.590" end="00:05:27.930" style="s2">environmental impact way more human</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.750" end="00:05:30.780" style="s2">connection and just a better life on</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.930" end="00:05:33.599" style="s2">this planet take care and I will see you</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.780" end="00:05:35.580" style="s2">the next time I&#39;m on a better world is</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.599" end="00:05:37.380" style="s2">on its way and I&#39;m gonna need to figure</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.580" end="00:05:37.970" style="s2">out a new tagline that doesn&#39;t say see</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.380" end="00:05:41.150" style="s2">you tomorrow</p>
