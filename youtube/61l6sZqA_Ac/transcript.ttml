<p begin="00:00:07.670" end="00:00:14.400" style="s2">hey folks welcome to the Dark Horse</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.800" end="00:00:17.970" style="s2">podcast livestream our 15th livestream</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.400" end="00:00:20.730" style="s2">I&#39;m sitting with dr. Heather hi and we</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.970" end="00:00:22.680" style="s2">are we are prepared to have quite an</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.730" end="00:00:25.439" style="s2">interesting discussion today I must say</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.680" end="00:00:28.619" style="s2">that some of the topics we are going to</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.439" end="00:00:30.090" style="s2">cover I regard as a bit dire and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.619" end="00:00:31.890" style="s2">hoping that there will be some humor in</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.090" end="00:00:33.630" style="s2">here but I should just prepare people at</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.890" end="00:00:34.890" style="s2">home that if there is humor it is likely</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.630" end="00:00:37.020" style="s2">to be gallows humor</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.890" end="00:00:38.850" style="s2">how are you feeling oh yeah pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.020" end="00:00:41.219" style="s2">the same pretty much the same okay good</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.850" end="00:00:43.290" style="s2">I&#39;m glad we&#39;re on the same page yes</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.219" end="00:00:46.020" style="s2">that&#39;s always a good thing yes for</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.290" end="00:00:48.660" style="s2">newcomers let&#39;s alert them to the</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.020" end="00:00:50.489" style="s2">structure of things we will do about an</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.660" end="00:00:53.579" style="s2">hour of conversation on some topics that</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.489" end="00:00:58.020" style="s2">we have decided to discuss you can file</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.579" end="00:01:00.629" style="s2">super chat questions on YouTube and we</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.020" end="00:01:02.670" style="s2">will do our best to answer them we will</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.629" end="00:01:04.739" style="s2">start with two questions from Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.670" end="00:01:07.890" style="s2">and then we will answer as many Supercat</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.739" end="00:01:10.619" style="s2">questions as possible in the second hour</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.890" end="00:01:11.850" style="s2">anything else announcement wise all</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.619" end="00:01:15.659" style="s2">right excellent</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.850" end="00:01:20.130" style="s2">so I believe we&#39;re going to start today</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.659" end="00:01:23.189" style="s2">with a discussion of the question not of</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.130" end="00:01:25.200" style="s2">whether or not this virus has emerged</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.189" end="00:01:28.619" style="s2">from the lab but a question that often</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.200" end="00:01:31.189" style="s2">comes up in response to discussions of</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.619" end="00:01:34.710" style="s2">that topic and the question that I see</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.189" end="00:01:35.070" style="s2">variations of is what difference would</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.710" end="00:01:37.140" style="s2">it make</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.070" end="00:01:39.570" style="s2">so it&#39;s come from a lab so it hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.140" end="00:01:44.280" style="s2">come from a lab we still have to do the</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.570" end="00:01:46.229" style="s2">same things and which is true at a first</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.280" end="00:01:48.509" style="s2">approximation with regard to some of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.229" end="00:01:50.880" style="s2">actions that we might take yes some of</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.509" end="00:01:53.850" style="s2">them are certainly absolutely universal</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.880" end="00:01:56.969" style="s2">and it makes no difference but I must</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.850" end="00:02:01.079" style="s2">say I am increasingly alarmed by the</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.969" end="00:02:02.430" style="s2">possibility that a laboratory origin</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.079" end="00:02:05.369" style="s2">would actually suggest something</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.430" end="00:02:08.250" style="s2">radically different about this virus and</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.369" end="00:02:11.099" style="s2">might explain some of the anomalous</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.250" end="00:02:12.770" style="s2">features that we see and might have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.099" end="00:02:14.930" style="s2">lot to say about what</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.770" end="00:02:16.580" style="s2">a course of action going forward would</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.930" end="00:02:17.930" style="s2">look like so maybe we choose should just</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.580" end="00:02:20.090" style="s2">flag this and say that I think it was</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.930" end="00:02:22.060" style="s2">episode 10 where you in particular</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.090" end="00:02:24.470" style="s2">talked about a lot of what you saw as</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.060" end="00:02:27.980" style="s2">some of the emerging evidence that this</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.470" end="00:02:31.070" style="s2">was this did emerge from a lab not as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.980" end="00:02:33.710" style="s2">bio weapon likely but as part of normal</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.070" end="00:02:36.710" style="s2">ongoing research in the last livestream</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.710" end="00:02:38.450" style="s2">that would be number 14 you showed a</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.710" end="00:02:39.980" style="s2">flowchart that you had made with your</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.450" end="00:02:42.440" style="s2">estimates as the likelihood of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.980" end="00:02:45.470" style="s2">various origins and it&#39;s likely that in</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.440" end="00:02:47.750" style="s2">a future episode I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.470" end="00:02:50.600" style="s2">live stream or not that you may continue</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.750" end="00:02:51.920" style="s2">this cover as well but you have plans to</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.600" end="00:02:54.590" style="s2">potentially continue this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.920" end="00:02:56.240" style="s2">so you are not evading this particular</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.590" end="00:02:57.890" style="s2">part of it it&#39;s just not the focus of</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.240" end="00:02:59.240" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing right now right now I</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.890" end="00:03:00.950" style="s2">think it&#39;s very important that we talk</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.240" end="00:03:03.230" style="s2">about the nature of that evidence and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.950" end="00:03:05.600" style="s2">do want to get into it but I think for</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.230" end="00:03:07.220" style="s2">people there are a couple of things that</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.600" end="00:03:08.810" style="s2">you should note about the public</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.220" end="00:03:12.500" style="s2">discussion that would tell you why we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.810" end="00:03:15.280" style="s2">so focused on this one is the people who</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.500" end="00:03:18.050" style="s2">dismiss what we&#39;ve done on the podcast</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.280" end="00:03:21.260" style="s2">almost invariably call it a conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.050" end="00:03:23.420" style="s2">theory we have been very careful to</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.260" end="00:03:26.120" style="s2">point out that this is a hypothesis and</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.420" end="00:03:29.270" style="s2">that a hypothesis is actually a unknown</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.120" end="00:03:31.370" style="s2">quantity we understand how a hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.270" end="00:03:33.260" style="s2">functions how you would know if it was</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.370" end="00:03:34.940" style="s2">true and when something is offered as a</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.260" end="00:03:37.190" style="s2">hypothesis it doesn&#39;t even mean that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.940" end="00:03:39.680" style="s2">person offering it is a believer that it</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.190" end="00:03:43.940" style="s2">is correct it is a formalization of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.680" end="00:03:46.060" style="s2">possibility and it suggests mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.940" end="00:03:48.830" style="s2">whereby you might establish or falsify</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.060" end="00:03:50.390" style="s2">its validity so we&#39;ve been careful about</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.830" end="00:03:52.280" style="s2">that and our detractors have tried to</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.390" end="00:03:55.130" style="s2">push us into this conspiracy theory buzz</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.280" end="00:03:57.350" style="s2">saw and I would just say I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.130" end="00:03:59.720" style="s2">it&#39;s worth taking seriously anybody who</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.350" end="00:04:02.570" style="s2">uses the term conspiracy theory to deal</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.720" end="00:04:06.890" style="s2">with a legitimate hypothesis as we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.570" end="00:04:08.510" style="s2">said earlier here if we try to assess</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.890" end="00:04:08.900" style="s2">our world through the lens of Occam&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.510" end="00:04:11.150" style="s2">razor</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.900" end="00:04:13.940" style="s2">also known as the law of parsimony which</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.150" end="00:04:15.650" style="s2">suggests that all else being equal the</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.940" end="00:04:19.580" style="s2">simplest explanation is most likely to</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.650" end="00:04:22.130" style="s2">be the true explanation then it seems</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.580" end="00:04:24.890" style="s2">like an easy thing for those who suggest</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.130" end="00:04:26.540" style="s2">conspiracy to be debunked but that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.890" end="00:04:29.120" style="s2">true just because you were trying</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.540" end="00:04:30.560" style="s2">to see to understand the world with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.120" end="00:04:32.450" style="s2">lens of Occam&#39;s razor does not mean the</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.560" end="00:04:34.070" style="s2">conspiracy does not happen it just means</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.450" end="00:04:36.650" style="s2">that it shouldn&#39;t be your default</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.070" end="00:04:38.660" style="s2">assumption right and you know on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.650" end="00:04:42.620" style="s2">flowchart that I presented there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.660" end="00:04:44.960" style="s2">pathway whereby this virus emerged as an</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.620" end="00:04:46.460" style="s2">intentional release it has a very low</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.960" end="00:04:47.870" style="s2">probability on it I don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.460" end="00:04:49.880" style="s2">this is likely to be true there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.870" end="00:04:51.770" style="s2">evidence for it so far but on the formal</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.880" end="00:04:54.250" style="s2">list of all the possibilities it has to</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.770" end="00:04:57.950" style="s2">be there okay but let&#39;s talk about what</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.250" end="00:05:01.160" style="s2">you and we think the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.950" end="00:05:06.290" style="s2">implications of what this virus is doing</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.160" end="00:05:08.240" style="s2">and might come to do our if it was at</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.290" end="00:05:11.930" style="s2">least partially engineered likely to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.240" end="00:05:15.560" style="s2">a hybridized recombinant virus in a lab</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.930" end="00:05:17.360" style="s2">from two pre-existing extent viruses out</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.560" end="00:05:20.450" style="s2">there in the world presumably in a bat</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.360" end="00:05:22.370" style="s2">and a penguin well I want to say one</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.450" end="00:05:24.650" style="s2">more thing about that the public</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.370" end="00:05:26.540" style="s2">discussion which is the most alarming</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.650" end="00:05:29.810" style="s2">thing about the public discussion is</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.540" end="00:05:31.930" style="s2">that there is almost no dissenting</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.810" end="00:05:34.850" style="s2">opinion to be found amongst</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.930" end="00:05:37.760" style="s2">establishment virologists as to whether</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.850" end="00:05:40.700" style="s2">or not this could have come from a lab</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.760" end="00:05:42.920" style="s2">and this is alarming because when one</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.700" end="00:05:44.600" style="s2">looks at the evidence it&#39;s not that it</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.920" end="00:05:45.890" style="s2">is clear that it came from a lab but it</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.600" end="00:05:48.110" style="s2">is clear that it might have come from a</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.890" end="00:05:49.850" style="s2">lab and that would explain at least the</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.110" end="00:05:52.970" style="s2">major coincidence of where on earth it</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.850" end="00:05:55.700" style="s2">emerged so the absence of that</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.970" end="00:05:58.550" style="s2">discussion forces those of us who are</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.700" end="00:06:00.050" style="s2">not establishment biologists to take up</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.550" end="00:06:02.030" style="s2">the slack and to have this discussion</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.050" end="00:06:03.860" style="s2">and really I feel it as a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.030" end="00:06:06.620" style="s2">obligation if they were discussing this</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.860" end="00:06:08.180" style="s2">and I saw something that looked like a</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.620" end="00:06:10.340" style="s2">rational discussion I might be</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.180" end="00:06:12.530" style="s2">interested in entering that discussion</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.340" end="00:06:14.240" style="s2">sometimes based on evolutionary things</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.530" end="00:06:15.650" style="s2">that they might be missing but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.240" end="00:06:17.950" style="s2">perfectly possible that we wouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.650" end="00:06:19.910" style="s2">to do this but in the absence of that</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.950" end="00:06:22.640" style="s2">responsible discussion at the highest</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.910" end="00:06:24.740" style="s2">levels of virology somehow we&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.640" end="00:06:28.310" style="s2">do this in podcast world which is far</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.740" end="00:06:30.890" style="s2">from ideal sure all right so let&#39;s talk</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.310" end="00:06:32.720" style="s2">about the question of not if it came</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.890" end="00:06:34.370" style="s2">from a lab but what if it came from a</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.720" end="00:06:35.539" style="s2">lab what would that suggest about where</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.370" end="00:06:39.449" style="s2">we are</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.539" end="00:06:41.879" style="s2">the thing that is increasingly alarming</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.449" end="00:06:44.309" style="s2">me and maybe I should remind people that</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.879" end="00:06:47.550" style="s2">if I have a scientific claim to fame it</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.309" end="00:06:51.779" style="s2">is in the study of telomeres senescence</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.550" end="00:06:55.139" style="s2">and cancer I advanced a hypothetical</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.779" end="00:06:59.129" style="s2">model which now has considerable support</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.139" end="00:07:01.050" style="s2">that aging is the downside that comes</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.129" end="00:07:03.899" style="s2">with a protective mechanism against</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.050" end="00:07:06.029" style="s2">cancers based in telomeres things at the</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.899" end="00:07:09.120" style="s2">ends of chromosomes in order to do that</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.029" end="00:07:13.139" style="s2">work I had to go through a roadblock</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.120" end="00:07:14.729" style="s2">which was that mice did not appear</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.139" end="00:07:16.589" style="s2">consistent with that hypothesis because</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.729" end="00:07:19.849" style="s2">they had extremely long telomeres and</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.589" end="00:07:21.629" style="s2">short lives and what I ended up</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.849" end="00:07:23.490" style="s2">hypothesizing which was later</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.629" end="00:07:25.559" style="s2">demonstrated in a lab by Carol Greider</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.490" end="00:07:27.270" style="s2">and Mike Eamonn was that mice don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.559" end="00:07:29.550" style="s2">actually have long telomeres that this</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.270" end="00:07:31.439" style="s2">was the result of evolution inside a</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.550" end="00:07:33.209" style="s2">laboratory environment that nobody had</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.439" end="00:07:35.009" style="s2">thought to worry about because they</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.209" end="00:07:37.439" style="s2">didn&#39;t realize that they had created</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.009" end="00:07:41.449" style="s2">artificial selection of a very intense</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.439" end="00:07:43.559" style="s2">type may i reword this in a sentence the</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.449" end="00:07:46.139" style="s2">observation that mice have long</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.559" end="00:07:49.860" style="s2">telomeres was not itself untrue</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.139" end="00:07:52.709" style="s2">except that mice weren&#39;t mice its lab</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.860" end="00:07:54.899" style="s2">mice mice that have been bred in and for</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.709" end="00:07:58.080" style="s2">in laboratories for laboratory research</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.899" end="00:08:00.569" style="s2">have long telomeres but wild mice do not</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.080" end="00:08:03.389" style="s2">therefore it was the category mouse that</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.569" end="00:08:04.949" style="s2">was an error and most people who weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.389" end="00:08:08.459" style="s2">organism by ologists evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.949" end="00:08:10.139" style="s2">biologists don&#39;t think that deeply about</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.459" end="00:08:11.819" style="s2">what it means when you say Mouse you</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.139" end="00:08:12.959" style="s2">know that it&#39;s many many species or that</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.819" end="00:08:15.029" style="s2">it might be different depending on</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.959" end="00:08:16.860" style="s2">population even but that that is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.029" end="00:08:18.839" style="s2">distinction it&#39;s not that the initial</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.860" end="00:08:22.019" style="s2">observation of long telomeres in</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.839" end="00:08:24.959" style="s2">parentheses some mice wasn&#39;t true but</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.019" end="00:08:27.479" style="s2">that there was a erroneous over</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.959" end="00:08:30.149" style="s2">generalization of the observation in</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.479" end="00:08:32.039" style="s2">these lab created and now lab studied</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.149" end="00:08:36.690" style="s2">mice to suggest that it was all mice</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.039" end="00:08:38.880" style="s2">that&#39;s perfectly said so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.690" end="00:08:40.409" style="s2">outgrowth of this is the recognition</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.880" end="00:08:43.050" style="s2">that evolution in a laboratory</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.409" end="00:08:46.170" style="s2">environment can in fact be extremely</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.050" end="00:08:48.790" style="s2">rapid and has important consequences for</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.170" end="00:08:50.740" style="s2">the creatures that are the result of it</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.790" end="00:08:53.640" style="s2">all right so now back to the question of</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.740" end="00:08:55.840" style="s2">well what if this did emerge in a lab</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.640" end="00:08:57.430" style="s2">one of the things you have to understand</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.840" end="00:09:00.100" style="s2">about the laboratory work that</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.430" end="00:09:02.380" style="s2">urologists regularly deploy in the study</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.100" end="00:09:05.080" style="s2">of things like coronaviruses is that</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.380" end="00:09:07.960" style="s2">they use a kind of serial passage which</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.080" end="00:09:11.350" style="s2">is a technical term for infecting</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.960" end="00:09:14.620" style="s2">something be it cells or living animals</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.350" end="00:09:16.980" style="s2">with a virus either a natural virus or</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.620" end="00:09:20.500" style="s2">one that they&#39;ve created as a chimera</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.980" end="00:09:23.530" style="s2">and then allowing it to be transmitted</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.500" end="00:09:26.470" style="s2">one cell to the next or one animal to</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.530" end="00:09:28.930" style="s2">the next and that this uses an</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.470" end="00:09:31.270" style="s2">experimental process to determine both</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.930" end="00:09:33.190" style="s2">what the nature of the virus is when it</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.270" end="00:09:36.070" style="s2">is exposed to tissues that allow it to</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.190" end="00:09:38.140" style="s2">function and also it allows us to see</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.070" end="00:09:43.270" style="s2">something about the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.140" end="00:09:47.350" style="s2">trajectory of viruses over time now the</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.270" end="00:09:50.230" style="s2">question is it is clear I believe we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.350" end="00:09:51.880" style="s2">almost clear that this is initially a</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.230" end="00:09:55.060" style="s2">bat virus that we&#39;re dealing with at the</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.880" end="00:09:56.800" style="s2">Maine bat bat bat bat virus probably</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.060" end="00:09:59.860" style="s2">from horseshoe that&#39;s almost certainly</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.800" end="00:10:02.290" style="s2">from horseshoe bats but did the</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.860" end="00:10:04.300" style="s2">progenitor virus either the actual virus</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.290" end="00:10:06.520" style="s2">or certainly the progenitor virus came</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.300" end="00:10:08.050" style="s2">from a species of horseshoe bat that</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.520" end="00:10:09.940" style="s2">doesn&#39;t live right around Wuhan Daluz</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.050" end="00:10:10.960" style="s2">within a few hundred miles yeah and we</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.940" end="00:10:12.280" style="s2">always have to leave open the</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.960" end="00:10:13.900" style="s2">possibility that there could be some</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.280" end="00:10:15.940" style="s2">other creature with a better match but</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.900" end="00:10:18.730" style="s2">from what we know of coronaviruses in</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.940" end="00:10:21.490" style="s2">creatures and we know a fair amount it</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.730" end="00:10:23.290" style="s2">does look like the core of the virus we</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.490" end="00:10:26.560" style="s2">are dealing with does come from a bat</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.290" end="00:10:28.300" style="s2">recently how recently and by what</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.560" end="00:10:31.900" style="s2">mechanism that&#39;s what the dispute is</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.300" end="00:10:37.240" style="s2">about but if this virus was taken into a</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.900" end="00:10:38.680" style="s2">lab and then escaped just by incorrect</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.240" end="00:10:40.810" style="s2">handling let&#39;s say but without</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.680" end="00:10:42.130" style="s2">modification then this probably says</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.810" end="00:10:43.780" style="s2">very little about what we&#39;re facing</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.130" end="00:10:45.220" style="s2">because we&#39;re dealing with a virus that</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.780" end="00:10:46.900" style="s2">could have jumped to somebody in a cave</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.220" end="00:10:49.570" style="s2">and it would have the characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.900" end="00:10:52.450" style="s2">that the ancestral virus has on the</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.570" end="00:10:55.330" style="s2">other hand if somebody composited</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.450" end="00:10:58.060" style="s2">several viruses in order probably to</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.330" end="00:11:00.310" style="s2">study the danger of viruses that might</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.060" end="00:11:01.970" style="s2">emerge from a cave if they took a virus</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.310" end="00:11:03.709" style="s2">and they turbocharged it to</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.970" end="00:11:05.000" style="s2">it especially infectious in order that</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.709" end="00:11:07.819" style="s2">they could study the process of</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.000" end="00:11:11.180" style="s2">infection maybe generate a therapy or a</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.819" end="00:11:12.529" style="s2">vaccine then they would have imbued it</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.180" end="00:11:15.589" style="s2">with characteristics that might actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.529" end="00:11:17.870" style="s2">be very difficult for a natural virus to</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.589" end="00:11:19.250" style="s2">have come by there are mechanisms but</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.870" end="00:11:21.290" style="s2">they require as we&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.250" end="00:11:23.600" style="s2">previously they would require for</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.290" end="00:11:25.699" style="s2">example two viruses from two different</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.600" end="00:11:27.649" style="s2">sources to infect the same animal to</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.699" end="00:11:28.879" style="s2">find themselves in the same cell and</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.649" end="00:11:30.379" style="s2">then to engage in a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.879" end="00:11:31.850" style="s2">recombination which is not impossible</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.379" end="00:11:35.089" style="s2">but it&#39;s difficult so that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.850" end="00:11:36.949" style="s2">unlikely thing it may happen but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.089" end="00:11:39.019" style="s2">very different than somebody in a lab</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.949" end="00:11:40.670" style="s2">deciding to take characteristics from</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.019" end="00:11:43.370" style="s2">here and characteristics from there and</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.670" end="00:11:46.279" style="s2">fuse them together and make what-if</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.370" end="00:11:49.040" style="s2">amounts to a super virus but even worse</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.279" end="00:11:51.439" style="s2">is the fact that if somebody took such a</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.040" end="00:11:53.439" style="s2">super virus and then they went through</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.439" end="00:11:59.230" style="s2">one of these serial passage experiments</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.439" end="00:12:01.819" style="s2">they a would have I believe selected for</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.230" end="00:12:07.029" style="s2">adaptation to the laboratory environment</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.819" end="00:12:09.949" style="s2">itself and B they might have induced a</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.029" end="00:12:12.079" style="s2">tendency in the virus to experiment</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.949" end="00:12:15.769" style="s2">beyond what a normal virus would do let</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.079" end="00:12:17.990" style="s2">me just pause this for a moment and say</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.769" end="00:12:21.290" style="s2">I don&#39;t think you even need all of that</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.990" end="00:12:25.490" style="s2">precursor argument about if they made a</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.290" end="00:12:27.350" style="s2">super virus that that would render the</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.490" end="00:12:29.629" style="s2">further selection in the lab through</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.350" end="00:12:32.240" style="s2">serial passage experimentation more</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.629" end="00:12:35.240" style="s2">likely to produce a particularly</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.240" end="00:12:37.220" style="s2">horrifying virus but even absent that</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.240" end="00:12:40.610" style="s2">absent the production of super virus all</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.220" end="00:12:43.759" style="s2">you really need is serial passage</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.610" end="00:12:45.850" style="s2">experimentation on a recombinant virus</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.759" end="00:12:49.069" style="s2">that&#39;s in the lab that&#39;s experimenting</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.850" end="00:12:52.129" style="s2">iterations of generations in the lab and</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.069" end="00:12:53.899" style="s2">you have a situation in which selection</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.129" end="00:12:56.509" style="s2">as you are about to get to selection is</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.899" end="00:12:59.540" style="s2">likely to produce a virus that explores</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.509" end="00:13:02.269" style="s2">rapidly and with very few breaks so I</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.540" end="00:13:04.009" style="s2">think I feel like the bit about if the</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.269" end="00:13:05.899" style="s2">lab had created this super bug we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.009" end="00:13:09.290" style="s2">need that and that actually produces</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.899" end="00:13:11.149" style="s2">more that&#39;s that&#39;s a big potential break</p>

<p begin="00:13:11.149" end="00:13:14.779" style="s2">to make the rest of the argument yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.250" end="00:13:15.550" style="s2">believe what you&#39;ve just said is</p>

<p begin="00:14:05.230" end="00:14:09.970" style="s2">here that I feel like the the</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.080" end="00:14:12.520" style="s2">interesting thing that we can add that</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.970" end="00:14:14.740" style="s2">is that is new that is that is novel is</p>

<p begin="00:14:27.520" end="00:14:32.530" style="s2">to the would be discredited by making an</p>

<p begin="00:14:39.520" end="00:14:44.230" style="s2">necessary we do know a lot about what</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.500" end="00:14:46.050" style="s2">was in the minds of the people studying</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.230" end="00:14:48.880" style="s2">these viruses because they published</p>

<p begin="00:14:56.470" end="00:15:00.250" style="s2">they were thinking and why they you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.450" end="00:15:01.420" style="s2">we&#39;re inclined to do the research but</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.250" end="00:15:03.700" style="s2">anyway I agree with you totally</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.420" end="00:15:05.650" style="s2">unnecessary the serial passage in and of</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.700" end="00:15:08.290" style="s2">itself will have had a selective effect</p>

<p begin="00:15:08.290" end="00:15:14.800" style="s2">other words was there enough time for it</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.660" end="00:15:17.050" style="s2">to change the viruses that is uncertain</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.800" end="00:15:18.760" style="s2">however so why don&#39;t you just say a</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.050" end="00:15:20.980" style="s2">little bit about what you think the</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.760" end="00:15:24.760" style="s2">Selective effect of just simply serial</p>

<p begin="00:15:29.050" end="00:15:34.900" style="s2">viruses release well let&#39;s start with</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.680" end="00:15:39.970" style="s2">another system and non virus so you can</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.900" end="00:15:42.160" style="s2">see the the basic parameters I remember</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.970" end="00:15:46.120" style="s2">from long ago when we were actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.160" end="00:15:48.160" style="s2">undergraduates at UCSC I took a great</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.120" end="00:15:50.080" style="s2">course with Bob Traverse it was a</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.160" end="00:15:52.210" style="s2">seminar Bob Trivers led it and Austin</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.080" end="00:15:55.800" style="s2">burt was a postdoc at the time</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.210" end="00:16:00.280" style="s2">Austin Burk is a very important</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.800" end="00:16:03.250" style="s2">evolutionary biologist trevor&#39;s is one</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.280" end="00:16:07.600" style="s2">of the greats and anyway the the issue</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.250" end="00:16:10.120" style="s2">of chimerism in cattle came up Austin</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.600" end="00:16:12.130" style="s2">brought it up and you need a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.120" end="00:16:14.470" style="s2">of technical terminology here to</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.130" end="00:16:17.680" style="s2">understand this but it&#39;s not tough when</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.470" end="00:16:20.170" style="s2">a mammal it&#39;s true for other creatures</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.680" end="00:16:23.290" style="s2">but when a mammal creates a sex cell and</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.170" end="00:16:25.930" style="s2">egg or sperm chimerism or Kia&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.290" end="00:16:27.190" style="s2">frequency chiasma feet oh we really need</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.930" end="00:16:28.750" style="s2">to go back and clarify because there are</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.190" end="00:16:30.400" style="s2">two very different terms that mean</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.750" end="00:16:31.990" style="s2">different things not really because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.400" end="00:16:34.240" style="s2">a chimeric chromosome but anyway you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.990" end="00:16:38.500" style="s2">right chiasma is the the right term so</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.240" end="00:16:40.990" style="s2">when a cell reproduces to make sex cells</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.500" end="00:16:43.240" style="s2">either eggs or sperm the chromosomes</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.990" end="00:16:45.070" style="s2">that the creature that&#39;s making those</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.240" end="00:16:47.350" style="s2">cells got from its mother and its father</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.070" end="00:16:49.330" style="s2">actually the two chromosomes that carry</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.350" end="00:16:51.160" style="s2">similar information line up together</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.330" end="00:16:52.840" style="s2">many of you will remember this from your</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.160" end="00:16:55.150" style="s2">high school biology class they line up</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.840" end="00:16:58.060" style="s2">together at the equator of the cell and</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.150" end="00:17:01.570" style="s2">then they swap information so that the</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.060" end="00:17:04.060" style="s2">sperm carries Composites and the egg</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.570" end="00:17:06.010" style="s2">carries Composites of the mother the</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.060" end="00:17:07.750" style="s2">maternal and paternal chromosomes but it</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.010" end="00:17:10.270" style="s2">doesn&#39;t carry the originals right it</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.750" end="00:17:12.490" style="s2">carries they&#39;ve been shuffled and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.270" end="00:17:14.740" style="s2">question of how so these shuffling</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.490" end="00:17:16.870" style="s2">events are called chiasma right so</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.740" end="00:17:18.430" style="s2">chiasma frequency is how much shuffling</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.870" end="00:17:20.290" style="s2">went on between the father&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.430" end="00:17:23.220" style="s2">mother&#39;s chromosomes to make the ones</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.290" end="00:17:27.250" style="s2">that go into the sperm or the egg</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.220" end="00:17:29.980" style="s2">the chiasma frequency is itself subject</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.250" end="00:17:33.550" style="s2">to evolutionary pressure and the point</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.980" end="00:17:36.850" style="s2">that austin put in front of us was that</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.550" end="00:17:39.280" style="s2">in cattle in particular the Chi a</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.850" end="00:17:40.210" style="s2">domestic domestic wild cattle but</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.280" end="00:17:42.370" style="s2">domestic cattle</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.210" end="00:17:42.970" style="s2">I think cattle means domestic but anyway</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.370" end="00:17:44.410" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.970" end="00:17:45.640" style="s2">but this but this the paper which</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.410" end="00:17:46.930" style="s2">unfortunately we could not find</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.640" end="00:17:49.270" style="s2">yesterday when we were looking for it</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.930" end="00:17:51.880" style="s2">suggested specifically that it wasn&#39;t in</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.270" end="00:17:54.940" style="s2">wild buffets but only in domestic cattle</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.880" end="00:17:57.040" style="s2">yeah have an incredibly high chiasma</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.940" end="00:18:00.370" style="s2">frequency and the interpretation was</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.040" end="00:18:03.190" style="s2">that when we exert artificial selection</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.370" end="00:18:05.260" style="s2">in you know in the feedlot we are</p>

<p begin="00:18:05.260" end="00:18:11.940" style="s2">us that may not come together they may</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.530" end="00:18:16.540" style="s2">be you know maybe that the large animal</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.940" end="00:18:17.830" style="s2">has a low tendency to produce milk or is</p>

<p begin="00:18:33.460" end="00:18:36.910" style="s2">that an animal that is highly</p>

<p begin="00:19:33.160" end="00:19:37.780" style="s2">then look to see which descendants of</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.560" end="00:19:39.250" style="s2">the initial virus are present they will</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.780" end="00:19:41.170" style="s2">be the ones that succeeded under those</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.250" end="00:19:43.450" style="s2">conditions and unless the lab is</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.170" end="00:19:46.270" style="s2">specifically looking for stability in a</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.450" end="00:19:48.310" style="s2">viral genome or viral phenotype then it</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.270" end="00:19:51.130" style="s2">will be exactly looking for change and</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.310" end="00:19:54.540" style="s2">therefore be selecting inadvertently in</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.130" end="00:19:56.330" style="s2">all likelihood be possibly advertently</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.540" end="00:19:59.450" style="s2">for four</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.330" end="00:20:03.799" style="s2">rates of change right asthma so if you</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.450" end="00:20:06.169" style="s2">accept that logic so far then the result</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.799" end="00:20:09.409" style="s2">of it is that what we may be facing if</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.169" end="00:20:11.269" style="s2">this is an escapee from a lab and the</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.409" end="00:20:13.460" style="s2">lab was engaged in these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.269" end="00:20:18.409" style="s2">experiments then what we may be facing</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.460" end="00:20:21.440" style="s2">is a virus that is more exploratory than</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.409" end="00:20:23.510" style="s2">a bat virus that infected somebody</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.440" end="00:20:26.570" style="s2">walking through a cave would have been</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.510" end="00:20:28.309" style="s2">because although that virus would still</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.570" end="00:20:30.320" style="s2">have a need to discover new ways of</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.309" end="00:20:31.909" style="s2">being and you know in general these</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.320" end="00:20:33.590" style="s2">things go extinct pretty quickly they do</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.909" end="00:20:35.870" style="s2">sometimes jump to people which the</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.590" end="00:20:37.940" style="s2">jangly lab has demonstrated but in</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.870" end="00:20:41.360" style="s2">general those infections don&#39;t spread to</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.940" end="00:20:42.889" style="s2">the globe so if we created a virus that</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.360" end="00:20:45.049" style="s2">was adapted to laboratory conditions</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.889" end="00:20:46.789" style="s2">that would have potentially some</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.049" end="00:20:49.190" style="s2">positive effects for us that would</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.789" end="00:20:50.360" style="s2">probably be temporary and it would have</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.190" end="00:20:52.580" style="s2">some negative effects the negative</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.360" end="00:20:55.700" style="s2">effect would be wow maybe we&#39;ve created</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.580" end="00:20:57.350" style="s2">something highly experimental and that</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.700" end="00:20:59.330" style="s2">might just be able to spread across the</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.350" end="00:21:00.860" style="s2">globe to different populations to</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.330" end="00:21:03.350" style="s2">different regions to different climates</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.860" end="00:21:06.049" style="s2">very very rapidly and which of course is</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.350" end="00:21:08.539" style="s2">exactly what we see two different organs</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.049" end="00:21:12.320" style="s2">and a different organs so not just</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.539" end="00:21:15.289" style="s2">across space globally but across space</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.320" end="00:21:19.820" style="s2">and system within individuals so this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.289" end="00:21:23.960" style="s2">actually why this topic has got me in</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.820" end="00:21:26.419" style="s2">kind of a dark mode because to the</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.960" end="00:21:29.149" style="s2">extent that this virus is teaching us</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.419" end="00:21:32.299" style="s2">how it behaves it seems to be quite</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.149" end="00:21:36.440" style="s2">anomalous the list of symptoms seems to</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.299" end="00:21:38.389" style="s2">grow by the week if not by the day the</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.440" end="00:21:41.750" style="s2">number of different syndromes that we</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.389" end="00:21:45.169" style="s2">see I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s even notable that</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.750" end="00:21:47.299" style="s2">we are calling this SARS because that</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.169" end="00:21:48.980" style="s2">was the first thing it looked like but</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.299" end="00:21:50.990" style="s2">from the point of view of all of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.980" end="00:21:53.510" style="s2">other things it creates you know this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.990" end="00:21:55.130" style="s2">not inherently respiratory that is it</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.510" end="00:21:57.950" style="s2">seems to be the way into the body in</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.130" end="00:22:00.260" style="s2">general but but it seems cardiac it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.950" end="00:22:01.730" style="s2">neurological it&#39;s blood it&#39;s children</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.260" end="00:22:04.909" style="s2">it&#39;s old people it manifests differently</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.730" end="00:22:06.799" style="s2">and well not just in different ages and</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.909" end="00:22:08.539" style="s2">different demographics but in different</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.799" end="00:22:09.370" style="s2">populations which may be an indication</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.539" end="00:22:11.410" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.370" end="00:22:13.630" style="s2">very different strains circulating</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.410" end="00:22:18.340" style="s2">simultaneously which we&#39;ll get to a</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.630" end="00:22:22.270" style="s2">little bit later yeah so if this is the</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.340" end="00:22:24.760" style="s2">cat it also on the plus side and this is</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.270" end="00:22:27.309" style="s2">a hypothesis I don&#39;t even know if I</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.760" end="00:22:31.030" style="s2">believe it but I know that it is worthy</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.309" end="00:22:34.780" style="s2">of consideration yes it is possible that</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.030" end="00:22:36.520" style="s2">the and we will get back to why we think</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.780" end="00:22:40.900" style="s2">this is the case but it is possible that</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.520" end="00:22:43.090" style="s2">the difficulty that one has contracting</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.900" end="00:22:44.800" style="s2">this disease outdoors that is to say the</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.090" end="00:22:46.660" style="s2">rarity with which it appears to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.800" end="00:22:48.910" style="s2">transmitted by people in an outdoor</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.660" end="00:22:51.940" style="s2">environment is the result of the fact</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.910" end="00:22:53.890" style="s2">that effectively the laboratory selected</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.940" end="00:22:57.270" style="s2">for viruses that are very good at being</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.890" end="00:23:01.870" style="s2">transmitted in an indoor environment and</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.270" end="00:23:04.929" style="s2">if that is the case then I believe it</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.870" end="00:23:09.280" style="s2">suggests that we have a limited amount</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.929" end="00:23:10.690" style="s2">of time to exploit its inability to jump</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.280" end="00:23:13.059" style="s2">from one person to the next</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.690" end="00:23:14.740" style="s2">outdoors wellness I think you&#39;ve said in</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.059" end="00:23:18.520" style="s2">an earlier live stream this would be the</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.740" end="00:23:20.830" style="s2">case if it had a immediate precursor bat</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.520" end="00:23:23.220" style="s2">origin as well aware transmission was</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.830" end="00:23:26.380" style="s2">likely happening between bats and a cave</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.220" end="00:23:28.300" style="s2">or we&#39;ve got serial passage</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.380" end="00:23:30.910" style="s2">experimentation of a possibly</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.300" end="00:23:34.809" style="s2">recombinant virus in a laboratory either</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.910" end="00:23:39.010" style="s2">way you&#39;ve got close quarters and no UV</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.809" end="00:23:41.260" style="s2">light and add add sunlight add air</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.010" end="00:23:44.020" style="s2">increase decrease population density</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.260" end="00:23:46.300" style="s2">increase space between would be carriers</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.020" end="00:23:47.890" style="s2">would be transmitters and the thing</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.300" end="00:23:50.559" style="s2">seems to have a very much harder time</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.890" end="00:23:52.720" style="s2">getting between hosts yeah and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.559" end="00:23:56.200" style="s2">actually it&#39;s amazing how extreme this</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.720" end="00:23:57.760" style="s2">effect is so one of the things you and I</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.200" end="00:24:00.490" style="s2">have talked about this there are certain</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.760" end="00:24:05.200" style="s2">things that are very hard to render</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.490" end="00:24:07.960" style="s2">graphically so all biologists of our age</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.200" end="00:24:09.670" style="s2">I would say suffer from a bad model of</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.960" end="00:24:11.320" style="s2">the way neurons function for example</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.670" end="00:24:12.910" style="s2">because a neuron in the brain might be</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.320" end="00:24:14.620" style="s2">connected its dendrites might be</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.910" end="00:24:16.990" style="s2">connected to a thousand other neurons</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.620" end="00:24:19.570" style="s2">it&#39;s very hard to depict that in any way</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.990" end="00:24:22.830" style="s2">that looks other than like a hairy cell</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.570" end="00:24:26.610" style="s2">right it&#39;s very hard to</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.830" end="00:24:29.250" style="s2">to depict abiotic computer in which each</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.610" end="00:24:30.830" style="s2">of the things that seem like wires are</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.250" end="00:24:34.230" style="s2">actually computers unto themselves</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.830" end="00:24:36.660" style="s2">connected to a thousand other cells at a</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.230" end="00:24:38.820" style="s2">time and so we have a bad sense of what</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.660" end="00:24:40.290" style="s2">a neuron is and how complex the</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.820" end="00:24:44.550" style="s2">interaction of one neuron what the next</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.290" end="00:24:47.520" style="s2">might be likewise we have a bad model</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.550" end="00:24:49.950" style="s2">for how viruses are transmitted the fact</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.520" end="00:24:54.770" style="s2">that I mean and this is not new this</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.950" end="00:24:58.040" style="s2">virus appears highly sensitive to the</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.770" end="00:25:01.080" style="s2">quantity of virus that one encounters</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.040" end="00:25:03.900" style="s2">right that does not fit the cartoons</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.080" end="00:25:06.960" style="s2">that we&#39;ve now all seen with a virus</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.900" end="00:25:09.840" style="s2">reaching a cell and gaining entry now</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.960" end="00:25:13.070" style="s2">that those cartoons are true right as</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.840" end="00:25:15.330" style="s2">far as we know a virus enters a cell and</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.070" end="00:25:19.020" style="s2">coaxes the cell into doing its bidding</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.330" end="00:25:22.320" style="s2">but but no no cartoon is going to convey</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.020" end="00:25:24.060" style="s2">the importance of viral load and time so</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.320" end="00:25:27.120" style="s2">the character single-frame cartoons</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.060" end="00:25:29.250" style="s2">can&#39;t do a good job of conveying that or</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.120" end="00:25:32.190" style="s2">if they do they can&#39;t they won&#39;t also</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.250" end="00:25:34.650" style="s2">convey the you know what you just</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.190" end="00:25:37.230" style="s2">suggested that the typical image does I</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.650" end="00:25:38.700" style="s2">mean this this does also point out to</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.230" end="00:25:39.870" style="s2">the problem you know the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.700" end="00:25:42.210" style="s2">science education the problem with</p>

<p begin="00:25:42.210" end="00:25:47.160" style="s2">textbooks textbooks tend to have these</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.300" end="00:25:48.720" style="s2">really simple cartoons even at the</p>

<p begin="00:25:48.720" end="00:25:52.980" style="s2">textbooks and immunology textbooks right</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.340" end="00:25:54.270" style="s2">is that language isn&#39;t the only way that</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.980" end="00:25:56.010" style="s2">we taking information and having</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.270" end="00:25:57.660" style="s2">information come in and you know across</p>

<p begin="00:25:59.400" end="00:26:03.840" style="s2">auditorally can really help synthesize</p>

<p begin="00:26:03.840" end="00:26:09.270" style="s2">but it&#39;s also really easy for those</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.440" end="00:26:11.820" style="s2">oversimplified visuals in particular or</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.270" end="00:26:13.110" style="s2">sound bytes right anything but is simple</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.820" end="00:26:14.190" style="s2">that you can remember without really</p>

<p begin="00:26:14.190" end="00:26:21.600" style="s2">principles analysis is going to be going</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.060" end="00:26:23.760" style="s2">to be likely to pop out and then confuse</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.600" end="00:26:25.920" style="s2">people into thinking oh that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.760" end="00:26:27.540" style="s2">the truth that&#39;s you know science says</p>

<p begin="00:26:27.540" end="00:26:32.880" style="s2">yeah the problem is they especially as</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.990" end="00:26:36.220" style="s2">you point out the visual stuff takes on</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.880" end="00:26:37.929" style="s2">a reality of its own then</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.220" end="00:26:41.139" style="s2">cryptically informs people or</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.929" end="00:26:43.299" style="s2">misinformed them and you&#39;ll all be able</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.139" end="00:26:45.039" style="s2">to detect this in yourselves if you</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.299" end="00:26:47.590" style="s2">think about a diagram of the solar</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.039" end="00:26:49.960" style="s2">system when we were at Evergreen I</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.590" end="00:26:52.059" style="s2">always wanted to get a little grant to</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.960" end="00:26:54.429" style="s2">install a scale model of the solar</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.059" end="00:26:56.529" style="s2">system because the solar system isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.429" end="00:26:59.320" style="s2">anything like the diagrams in a textbook</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.529" end="00:27:03.279" style="s2">because you can&#39;t do it you know if the</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.320" end="00:27:06.669" style="s2">Sun either you know if the Sun is yay</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.279" end="00:27:08.919" style="s2">big and the earth is tiny and then Pluto</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.669" end="00:27:11.590" style="s2">is a long walk right how do you depict</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.919" end="00:27:12.879" style="s2">that on a page right and it would on</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.590" end="00:27:14.200" style="s2">that campus it would have been possible</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.879" end="00:27:17.289" style="s2">because it was on a thousand acres of</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.200" end="00:27:20.559" style="s2">forest whereas most places can&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.289" end="00:27:24.129" style="s2">imagine having such a model and most</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.559" end="00:27:26.110" style="s2">many many observatories try this and you</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.129" end="00:27:27.580" style="s2">know you&#39;ll run into a planet somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.110" end="00:27:30.309" style="s2">in some totally different room where the</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.580" end="00:27:31.629" style="s2">center of the Sun was far away but of</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.309" end="00:27:34.149" style="s2">course the walls are their exhibits</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.629" end="00:27:35.799" style="s2">between it it it doesn&#39;t really make the</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.149" end="00:27:37.509" style="s2">point as strongly you really need to</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.799" end="00:27:41.169" style="s2">walk to Pluto before you understand but</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.509" end="00:27:43.809" style="s2">wait this is just for me now no no okay</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.169" end="00:27:46.000" style="s2">believe me I need you right there but so</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.809" end="00:27:48.360" style="s2">anyway we&#39;ve departed from the topic but</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.000" end="00:27:50.919" style="s2">I&#39;m not even convinced that we</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.360" end="00:27:54.549" style="s2">understand by we I mean the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.919" end="00:27:57.490" style="s2">establishment understands why viral load</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.549" end="00:27:59.440" style="s2">plays the role it does in infection and</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.490" end="00:28:02.259" style="s2">you know maybe it does maybe we just</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.440" end="00:28:05.169" style="s2">don&#39;t know but but there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.259" end="00:28:07.899" style="s2">there&#39;s some system that is dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.169" end="00:28:10.149" style="s2">a large number of things a large number</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.899" end="00:28:12.820" style="s2">of incoming viral particles successfully</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.149" end="00:28:14.429" style="s2">in general but too many viral particles</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.820" end="00:28:18.360" style="s2">at once or in a short period of time</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.429" end="00:28:21.820" style="s2">overwhelms it could be the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.360" end="00:28:24.220" style="s2">macrophages and other general generalist</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.820" end="00:28:25.990" style="s2">cells are really successful at capturing</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.220" end="00:28:29.320" style="s2">free-floating virus that they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.990" end="00:28:31.480" style="s2">particular warnings about but that they</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.320" end="00:28:36.759" style="s2">can all be occupied and something gets</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.480" end="00:28:44.440" style="s2">over the wall who knows but in any case</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.759" end="00:28:47.320" style="s2">the the laboratory environment would in</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.440" end="00:28:49.320" style="s2">all probability have favored certain</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.320" end="00:28:53.610" style="s2">characteristics and to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.320" end="00:28:58.320" style="s2">that Subway&#39;s local trains seems</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.610" end="00:29:01.980" style="s2">something like a cage in which you might</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.320" end="00:29:03.720" style="s2">have a bunch of animals who you were</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.980" end="00:29:05.460" style="s2">trying to infect in order to see what</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.720" end="00:29:08.070" style="s2">the consequence was for them and what</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.460" end="00:29:12.720" style="s2">the result was for the virus nursing</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.070" end="00:29:16.049" style="s2">homes meatpacking plants yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.720" end="00:29:19.440" style="s2">so you know could this be a dead end and</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.049" end="00:29:22.470" style="s2">and irrelevant it could be but if it</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.440" end="00:29:24.809" style="s2">isn&#39;t a dead end I can&#39;t escape the idea</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.470" end="00:29:27.389" style="s2">that this is really at some level</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.809" end="00:29:30.240" style="s2">possibly the most important question in</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.389" end="00:29:32.220" style="s2">the world at the moment is to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.240" end="00:29:36.600" style="s2">that we can get a leg up on this virus</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.220" end="00:29:39.000" style="s2">by finding out what we know of its</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.600" end="00:29:41.250" style="s2">nature if it came from a lab the people</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.000" end="00:29:44.429" style="s2">who ran that lab know things that we</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.250" end="00:29:48.419" style="s2">need to know and I&#39;m not suggesting I</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.429" end="00:29:50.460" style="s2">think people try to push ideas to the</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.419" end="00:29:53.039" style="s2">near the nearest idea that they know</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.460" end="00:29:55.740" style="s2">themselves and they synonymous the - we</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.039" end="00:29:57.120" style="s2">know that Thinking Fast and Slow would</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.740" end="00:30:01.980" style="s2">be a good place to hear about this kind</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.120" end="00:30:04.710" style="s2">of cognitive bias but in any case I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.980" end="00:30:07.799" style="s2">not advocating I&#39;m not even interested</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.710" end="00:30:09.840" style="s2">in responsibility if these were</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.799" end="00:30:11.940" style="s2">scientists working honorably what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.840" end="00:30:14.279" style="s2">really interested in is what might they</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.940" end="00:30:15.750" style="s2">know about what we&#39;re up against if this</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.279" end="00:30:17.250" style="s2">if this thing has been selected for a</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.750" end="00:30:19.110" style="s2">laboratory environment and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.250" end="00:30:21.750" style="s2">things that it that imbued it with was a</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.110" end="00:30:24.360" style="s2">low resistance to UV light because it</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.750" end="00:30:26.129" style="s2">borrowed capacity from resistance to UV</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.360" end="00:30:28.409" style="s2">light in order to do other things that</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.129" end="00:30:30.870" style="s2">made a difference in the lab if having</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.409" end="00:30:32.669" style="s2">it the hypothesis being it would have</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.870" end="00:30:34.620" style="s2">been able to borrow capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.669" end="00:30:36.629" style="s2">resistance to UV light because it was</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.620" end="00:30:39.269" style="s2">experiencing novi UV light and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.629" end="00:30:41.190" style="s2">it suffered nothing in the immediate</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.269" end="00:30:43.200" style="s2">environment which was being selected for</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.190" end="00:30:44.820" style="s2">rise to spell out the argument there</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.200" end="00:30:46.500" style="s2">would be a trade-off and this would be a</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.820" end="00:30:48.509" style="s2">cheap place to borrow yeah well if</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.500" end="00:30:50.730" style="s2">that&#39;s true then what we would expect is</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.509" end="00:30:53.129" style="s2">over time as this thing floats around in</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.730" end="00:30:54.809" style="s2">the world it will evolve a resistance to</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.129" end="00:30:57.750" style="s2">UV light the outdoor environment will</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.809" end="00:30:59.990" style="s2">become more dangerous one thing that</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.750" end="00:31:02.830" style="s2">would also be true is that it would be</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.990" end="00:31:06.070" style="s2">imperative not to give</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.830" end="00:31:08.559" style="s2">at that selective signal in other words</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.070" end="00:31:10.570" style="s2">to the extent that today it might be</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.559" end="00:31:12.610" style="s2">very difficult to contract this outdoors</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.570" end="00:31:14.890" style="s2">I would say that does not mean relax</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.610" end="00:31:18.330" style="s2">outdoors I would say it means go</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.890" end="00:31:21.070" style="s2">outdoors and be very vigilant about the</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.330" end="00:31:23.470" style="s2">means of preventing it from jumping so</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.070" end="00:31:26.529" style="s2">we don&#39;t give one of it a hint to give</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.470" end="00:31:28.840" style="s2">one of these strains a hint about some</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.529" end="00:31:31.990" style="s2">other way it could be transmitted right</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.840" end="00:31:34.059" style="s2">so I mean I guess maybe just to just</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.990" end="00:31:36.370" style="s2">fill it out a little bit I think on the</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.059" end="00:31:38.289" style="s2">last live stream we showed a chart that</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.370" end="00:31:41.110" style="s2">a doctor had put together so you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.289" end="00:31:43.269" style="s2">estimating various risks from various</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.110" end="00:31:46.059" style="s2">activities and if you&#39;ve got three</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.269" end="00:31:47.620" style="s2">activities that are possible go outside</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.059" end="00:31:49.899" style="s2">but physically distance from people you</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.620" end="00:31:54.490" style="s2">haven&#39;t been effectively in lockdown</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.899" end="00:31:57.250" style="s2">within your home go outside and be in a</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.490" end="00:31:58.899" style="s2">group of strangers versus go inside and</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.250" end="00:32:01.120" style="s2">be in maybe let&#39;s take four you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.899" end="00:32:03.429" style="s2">outside effectively alone or just with</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.120" end="00:32:05.440" style="s2">those who you already shared pathogens</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.429" end="00:32:08.679" style="s2">with outside and close proximity to</p>

<p begin="00:32:16.360" end="00:32:22.240" style="s2">is clearly at the moment given what this</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.820" end="00:32:24.750" style="s2">virus is doing right now by far the way</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.240" end="00:32:28.330" style="s2">that the virus is most likely to spread</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.750" end="00:32:32.260" style="s2">then and outside without close proximity</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.330" end="00:32:35.110" style="s2">strangers is by far the least likely way</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.260" end="00:32:37.779" style="s2">to get the virus and in fact we see no</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.110" end="00:32:40.000" style="s2">evidence that the virus is persisting in</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.779" end="00:32:42.240" style="s2">any way outside if there are hemant</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.000" end="00:32:44.559" style="s2">people around so you know outside</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.240" end="00:32:47.799" style="s2">without being in close proximity to</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.559" end="00:32:50.769" style="s2">other people it&#39;s always possible you</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.799" end="00:32:53.049" style="s2">know the wind spreads would wind spreads</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.769" end="00:32:54.549" style="s2">viral particles in strange ways but the</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.049" end="00:32:56.409" style="s2">risk is diminished and they&#39;re low and</p>

<p begin="00:32:58.720" end="00:33:04.240" style="s2">benefits to being outside are huge and</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.730" end="00:33:06.610" style="s2">that seems not just safe but like the</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.240" end="00:33:09.279" style="s2">important thing to do whereas you know</p>

<p begin="00:34:13.000" end="00:34:17.879" style="s2">or eliminate them altogether if their</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.889" end="00:34:20.950" style="s2">point was let&#39;s be hyper vigilant about</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.879" end="00:34:24.090" style="s2">being careful rather than let&#39;s behave</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.950" end="00:34:29.500" style="s2">like the virus isn&#39;t that serious</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.090" end="00:34:32.200" style="s2">because at some level if we if some of</p>

<p begin="00:34:44.830" end="00:34:51.850" style="s2">or not we&#39;re all in this together and</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.429" end="00:34:53.139" style="s2">that forces us to have a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.850" end="00:34:56.770" style="s2">that yeah I agree it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.139" end="00:34:59.650" style="s2">uncomfortable but we really have to we</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.770" end="00:35:02.500" style="s2">have to do it so we spent more than half</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.650" end="00:35:04.060" style="s2">our time on this already maybe instead</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.500" end="00:35:05.890" style="s2">of going in order here you want to jump</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.060" end="00:35:07.270" style="s2">to the end not because we want to skip</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.890" end="00:35:09.760" style="s2">everything in the middle because you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.270" end="00:35:13.090" style="s2">already alluded to it several times and</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.760" end="00:35:14.740" style="s2">basically the evidence continues to</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.090" end="00:35:18.060" style="s2">mount as we have talked about in several</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.740" end="00:35:20.619" style="s2">lab streams that being outside provides</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.060" end="00:35:23.380" style="s2">protection against getting the virus</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.619" end="00:35:25.690" style="s2">both because you&#39;re less likely to run</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.380" end="00:35:28.970" style="s2">into it because if you do get it you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.690" end="00:35:31.340" style="s2">more likely to have to be healthier</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.970" end="00:35:33.140" style="s2">be more likely to resist serious illness</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.340" end="00:35:37.010" style="s2">and you&#39;re also less likely to transmit</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.140" end="00:35:39.050" style="s2">it to others being outside but this Zak</p>

<p begin="00:36:29.420" end="00:36:33.700" style="s2">and we should be making public policy</p>

<p begin="00:36:37.339" end="00:36:40.550" style="s2">both been talking about this since</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.570" end="00:36:41.839" style="s2">actually you know I started saying</p>

<p begin="00:36:44.570" end="00:36:47.750" style="s2">yes we need to social distance and</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.339" end="00:36:49.070" style="s2">really physical distance is probably the</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.750" end="00:36:51.410" style="s2">better term but we should not nature</p>

<p begin="00:36:58.970" end="00:37:05.240" style="s2">nuance across the board now right and</p>

<p begin="00:38:04.430" end="00:38:09.680" style="s2">what being outside is not the problem</p>

<p begin="00:42:15.590" end="00:42:22.700" style="s2">with people which tells me that this is</p>

<p begin="00:43:25.340" end="00:43:28.760" style="s2">know this is the read that people have</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.630" end="00:43:30.530" style="s2">been that people who don&#39;t seem to</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.760" end="00:43:32.780" style="s2">understand the nuance here have been</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.530" end="00:43:35.390" style="s2">taking you&#39;re suggesting is lock downs</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.780" end="00:43:36.590" style="s2">well no you&#39;re not suggesting is lock</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.390" end="00:43:39.140" style="s2">downs your suggests we&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.590" end="00:43:42.020" style="s2">suggesting do lock downs right and get</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.140" end="00:43:44.720" style="s2">rid of immediately all of the bad parts</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.020" end="00:43:47.060" style="s2">of the policy yeah I mean the point is</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.720" end="00:43:49.100" style="s2">lockdown sucks to the extent that we</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.060" end="00:43:51.590" style="s2">need it for epidemiological reasons</p>

<p begin="00:43:51.590" end="00:43:55.190" style="s2">possible this is an obvious place that</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.870" end="00:43:57.050" style="s2">we could make things better now I do</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.190" end="00:43:58.970" style="s2">have one regret about my tweet which I</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.050" end="00:44:01.610" style="s2">didn&#39;t even occur to me until people</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.970" end="00:44:05.060" style="s2">started calling me out about it which is</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.610" end="00:44:06.890" style="s2">the word instruct I don&#39;t believe that</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.060" end="00:44:09.620" style="s2">we are actually instructing people to</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.890" end="00:44:11.060" style="s2">stay indoors per se there are examples</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.620" end="00:44:12.830" style="s2">of people who&#39;ve been told to get out of</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.060" end="00:44:14.300" style="s2">their yards and things like that but</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.830" end="00:44:16.250" style="s2">those are going to be rare what we are</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.300" end="00:44:18.950" style="s2">doing they&#39;re very common in some places</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.250" end="00:44:21.140" style="s2">in England there is a lot of that okay</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.950" end="00:44:22.640" style="s2">so what we are doing though</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.140" end="00:44:25.340" style="s2">is we are keeping the places that people</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.640" end="00:44:27.980" style="s2">might go out doors closed in many</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.340" end="00:44:30.440" style="s2">locations and that is causing those who</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.980" end="00:44:32.030" style="s2">do out go out doors to concentrate so</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.440" end="00:44:33.740" style="s2">it&#39;s the same kind of mistake as between</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.030" end="00:44:40.490" style="s2">the local trains and the Express trains</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.740" end="00:44:41.950" style="s2">in cities and it is also not offering</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.490" end="00:44:45.230" style="s2">people the kinds of opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.950" end="00:44:46.940" style="s2">outdoors so at some level commerce is</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.230" end="00:44:48.350" style="s2">dangerous in many regards there are</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.940" end="00:44:49.280" style="s2">certain things that can be made safer</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.350" end="00:44:50.750" style="s2">and there are certain things that are</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.280" end="00:44:53.590" style="s2">necessary but commerce tends to</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.750" end="00:44:56.390" style="s2">concentrate people inside of buildings</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.590" end="00:44:58.700" style="s2">whereas going to the park going to the</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.390" end="00:45:00.770" style="s2">beach you know taking a hike on a trail</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.700" end="00:45:04.070" style="s2">those things appear to be safe and</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.770" end="00:45:06.020" style="s2">healthy so in any case maybe we&#39;ve said</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.070" end="00:45:07.460" style="s2">enough enough about that can I go back</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.020" end="00:45:09.920" style="s2">and correct one thing before people take</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.460" end="00:45:13.970" style="s2">me to task ok I do not mean to imply</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.920" end="00:45:15.770" style="s2">that coronaviruses have crossing over in</p>

<p begin="00:45:38.570" end="00:45:43.520" style="s2">particularly onerous now and I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.490" end="00:45:45.860" style="s2">you sort of you did that you said right</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.520" end="00:45:47.240" style="s2">now of all times we need access</p>

<p begin="00:48:42.180" end="00:48:45.900" style="s2">to have dinner youtube took it down and</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.369" end="00:48:47.760" style="s2">then they took down another one</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.900" end="00:48:50.190" style="s2">and ended up on bit sheet words findable</p>

<p begin="00:48:53.460" end="00:48:59.250" style="s2">was another example of you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.020" end="00:49:01.440" style="s2">certainly much of what they were saying</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.250" end="00:49:07.200" style="s2">was medically unsubstantiated and I</p>

<p begin="00:50:08.910" end="00:50:12.270" style="s2">but that doesn&#39;t mean that we shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.920" end="00:50:14.130" style="s2">be able to see what she has to say</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.270" end="00:50:16.200" style="s2">so just because this is this question</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.130" end="00:50:18.150" style="s2">about her has come at us a lot in the</p>

<p begin="00:53:10.680" end="00:53:14.109" style="s2">where the platforms</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.980" end="00:53:16.930" style="s2">land otherwise they&#39;re gonna create a</p>

<p begin="00:53:16.930" end="00:53:19.570" style="s2">right and just one more thing on this</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.310" end="00:53:21.730" style="s2">before we&#39;re gonna try to get to two</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.570" end="00:53:25.270" style="s2">more topics before you know a few</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.730" end="00:53:28.780" style="s2">minutes is up here but the preprint</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.270" end="00:53:31.000" style="s2">servers which have before this global</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.780" end="00:53:34.600" style="s2">pandemic been a place for people to put</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.000" end="00:53:36.490" style="s2">papers in advance of them being usually</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.600" end="00:53:39.280" style="s2">printed as opposed to accept it but</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.490" end="00:53:40.660" style="s2">maybe even just as they have I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.280" end="00:53:42.340" style="s2">actually know what the various rules</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.660" end="00:53:44.020" style="s2">have been for when papers end up in pre</p>

<p begin="00:53:44.020" end="00:53:49.119" style="s2">have been through the clearing houses</p>

<p begin="00:53:49.119" end="00:53:54.310" style="s2">that is relevant to the modern moment</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.390" end="00:53:56.440" style="s2">with regard to coronavirus if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.310" end="00:53:58.560" style="s2">done a piece of experimental research or</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.440" end="00:54:02.290" style="s2">a review paper you can put it up and</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.560" end="00:54:04.690" style="s2">your show this for a moment sac nature</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.290" end="00:54:06.340" style="s2">publishes now a week ago how swamped</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.690" end="00:54:08.320" style="s2">preprint servers are blocking bad</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.340" end="00:54:10.630" style="s2">coronavirus research now that word</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.320" end="00:54:12.760" style="s2">swamped suggests that they just can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.630" end="00:54:15.280" style="s2">handle it and that&#39;s of course editorial</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.760" end="00:54:16.780" style="s2">against sleight of hand by Nature when</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.280" end="00:54:18.670" style="s2">actually what the preprint servers are</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.780" end="00:54:21.609" style="s2">trying to do is cover their asses and</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.670" end="00:54:23.920" style="s2">get rid of some of the maybe less savory</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.609" end="00:54:25.570" style="s2">or less I don&#39;t even know what</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.920" end="00:54:28.420" style="s2">politically correct medically correct</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.570" end="00:54:30.310" style="s2">you know whatever it is results that</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.420" end="00:54:32.590" style="s2">they&#39;re not liking so even the preprint</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.310" end="00:54:34.150" style="s2">servers now are doing sort of behind the</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.590" end="00:54:39.490" style="s2">scenes edit on what it is that we can</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.150" end="00:54:42.880" style="s2">see yeah it&#39;s part of what Eric calls</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.490" end="00:54:45.460" style="s2">the distributed idea suppression complex</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.880" end="00:54:47.170" style="s2">the disk right when it maintains the</p>

<p begin="00:54:47.170" end="00:54:51.670" style="s2">here nature which is like the you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.840" end="00:54:53.290" style="s2">one of the pillars of the gated</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.670" end="00:54:54.790" style="s2">institutional narrative is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.290" end="00:54:57.490" style="s2">shut down a mechanism through which</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.790" end="00:54:59.320" style="s2">other people are exploring ideas that</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.490" end="00:55:00.609" style="s2">nature doesn&#39;t want to touch hello I</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.320" end="00:55:02.320" style="s2">mean nature&#39;s not shutting it down</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.609" end="00:55:05.290" style="s2">nature&#39;s it&#39;s just nature&#39;s headline</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.320" end="00:55:08.109" style="s2">that centers broadcasting as this and it</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.290" end="00:55:12.369" style="s2">is characterizing it as swamped servers</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.109" end="00:55:17.470" style="s2">which I would point out is an echo we</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.369" end="00:55:20.220" style="s2">have peer-review in part because on</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.470" end="00:55:22.960" style="s2">paper there was some need to sort</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.220" end="00:55:24.460" style="s2">quality from non quality because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.960" end="00:55:24.829" style="s2">a limit of how much paper and ink there</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.460" end="00:55:27.109" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.829" end="00:55:28.759" style="s2">expensive stuff that wasn&#39;t the entire</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.109" end="00:55:30.619" style="s2">reason but that&#39;s part of the reason in</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.759" end="00:55:31.849" style="s2">a world of electronic journals this is</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.619" end="00:55:34.999" style="s2">no longer necessary</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.849" end="00:55:37.069" style="s2">and anyway nature is now trying to</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.999" end="00:55:38.509" style="s2">characterize the preprint servers as</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.069" end="00:55:39.739" style="s2">having limited space and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.509" end="00:55:42.859" style="s2">reason they need to do this which is of</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.739" end="00:55:45.380" style="s2">course nonsense okay I think we have to</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.859" end="00:55:47.329" style="s2">choose between these either talking</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.380" end="00:55:49.999" style="s2">about the theater Theodore Roosevelt</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.329" end="00:55:51.619" style="s2">aircraft carrier or the T cells found in</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.999" end="00:55:52.910" style="s2">Kovac 19 patients bode well for long</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.619" end="00:55:54.079" style="s2">term immunity which which are they</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.910" end="00:55:56.289" style="s2">should we go they are unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.079" end="00:56:00.680" style="s2">connected so let&#39;s try to do it quickly</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.289" end="00:56:03.589" style="s2">so we have all I could find at the last</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.680" end="00:56:05.709" style="s2">minute here is an NPR story suggesting</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.589" end="00:56:08.329" style="s2">that what we&#39;ve seen we&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.709" end="00:56:09.769" style="s2">indications a few places that the</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.329" end="00:56:10.789" style="s2">Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.769" end="00:56:14.329" style="s2">which we&#39;ve talked about earlier</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.789" end="00:56:15.709" style="s2">livestreams and had several people who</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.329" end="00:56:17.029" style="s2">had tested positive I don&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.709" end="00:56:18.920" style="s2">what the number was for as far more than</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.029" end="00:56:20.809" style="s2">five but five servicemen who had</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.920" end="00:56:22.940" style="s2">previously tested positive had them</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.809" end="00:56:25.599" style="s2">tested negative and it&#39;s been many weeks</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.940" end="00:56:27.829" style="s2">I think have tested positive again</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.599" end="00:56:29.329" style="s2">tested positive after testing negative</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.829" end="00:56:31.339" style="s2">to a very high standard I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.329" end="00:56:34.759" style="s2">something over a thousand cases and Zak</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.339" end="00:56:38.979" style="s2">you do have the Navy&#39;s I think the Navy</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.759" end="00:56:42.469" style="s2">Times report on this can you put that up</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.979" end="00:56:44.690" style="s2">okay so this is a very scary possibility</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.469" end="00:56:46.849" style="s2">and we&#39;ve alluded to it before we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.690" end="00:56:48.799" style="s2">know if it&#39;s true or not you know of</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.849" end="00:56:50.779" style="s2">course one of one of one of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.799" end="00:56:53.839" style="s2">implications of this could be actually</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.779" end="00:56:56.660" style="s2">those negative tests that the servicemen</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.839" end="00:56:59.719" style="s2">got in the interim were wrong and they</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.660" end="00:57:01.880" style="s2">were positive the whole time but if true</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.719" end="00:57:06.289" style="s2">it means that the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.880" end="00:57:09.680" style="s2">reinfection exists which is to say that</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.289" end="00:57:12.079" style="s2">having had at least one strain of sorry</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.680" end="00:57:13.549" style="s2">Scobie - does not protect you against</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.079" end="00:57:14.569" style="s2">possibly other strains and of course no</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.549" end="00:57:15.920" style="s2">one is talking about the distinction</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.569" end="00:57:18.309" style="s2">between strains we should spend some</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.920" end="00:57:21.529" style="s2">time on that in the future or</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.309" end="00:57:23.269" style="s2">re-emergence sort of in the style isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.529" end="00:57:25.009" style="s2">exactly yet but I&#39;ve you know from for</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.269" end="00:57:27.680" style="s2">me the model I have in my head is vivax</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.009" end="00:57:30.680" style="s2">malaria that tends to hide out in the</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.680" end="00:57:32.299" style="s2">liver not be detectable by malaria tests</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.680" end="00:57:34.099" style="s2">while it&#39;s hiding out and and the person</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.299" end="00:57:35.119" style="s2">who&#39;s carrying it is asymptomatic but</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.099" end="00:57:36.570" style="s2">when it comes out of the liver the</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.119" end="00:57:38.400" style="s2">person becomes symptomatic and</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.570" end="00:57:41.360" style="s2">when in you know because malaria is</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.400" end="00:57:44.060" style="s2">vectored if a mosquito bites you then</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.360" end="00:57:46.350" style="s2">then you can transmit to other people so</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.060" end="00:57:49.110" style="s2">reemergence who knows where it&#39;s hiding</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.350" end="00:57:50.940" style="s2">if that&#39;s the case or reinfection yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.110" end="00:57:53.220" style="s2">both of these are possible</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.940" end="00:57:55.230" style="s2">interpretations as you point out it</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.220" end="00:57:57.900" style="s2">could also be erroneous but this is a</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.230" end="00:58:04.410" style="s2">very frightening possibility and those</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.900" end="00:58:06.890" style="s2">who are pushing a wreckless I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.410" end="00:58:09.630" style="s2">to say agenda but are proposing a</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.890" end="00:58:12.800" style="s2">removal of lockdown and basically</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.630" end="00:58:15.240" style="s2">letting the virus run its course are</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.800" end="00:58:17.180" style="s2">creating a much greater danger if either</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.240" end="00:58:20.100" style="s2">one of these things is true if either</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.180" end="00:58:25.110" style="s2">there&#39;s no immunity long term immunity</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.100" end="00:58:27.240" style="s2">generated by contracting Tsarskoe v2 or</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.110" end="00:58:29.100" style="s2">it hides out in some tissue and RIA</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.240" end="00:58:34.920" style="s2">merges periodically both of these would</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.100" end="00:58:36.750" style="s2">be very bad outcomes okay so the second</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.920" end="00:58:38.160" style="s2">thing that the final thing that we</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.750" end="00:58:42.870" style="s2">wanted to talk about before taking a</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.160" end="00:58:47.130" style="s2">break is this science report so this is</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.870" end="00:58:49.320" style="s2">again a reporting of about some other</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.130" end="00:58:51.510" style="s2">research that has been done Zack if you</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.320" end="00:58:53.820" style="s2">would show it please T cells found in</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.510" end="00:58:56.970" style="s2">Koba 19 patients bode well and quotes</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.820" end="00:58:58.110" style="s2">for long-term immunity and this and this</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.970" end="00:59:00.590" style="s2">is gonna require a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.110" end="00:59:04.650" style="s2">immunology to parse and we also have the</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.590" end="00:59:06.090" style="s2">the original papers that this paper is</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.650" end="00:59:08.510" style="s2">citing I don&#39;t know how much we want to</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.090" end="00:59:14.640" style="s2">spend on this well I think that this</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.510" end="00:59:15.090" style="s2">story actually buried the lede so I</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.640" end="00:59:17.250" style="s2">don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.090" end="00:59:19.710" style="s2">maybe I&#39;m just off here but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.250" end="00:59:24.840" style="s2">think it&#39;s very surprising at all that T</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.710" end="00:59:26.700" style="s2">cells that react to SARS co2 are found</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.840" end="00:59:30.090" style="s2">in people who have had these infections</p>

<p begin="00:59:33.900" end="00:59:36.990" style="s2">the longest possible moment that people</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.790" end="00:59:39.720" style="s2">could have been infected with this virus</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.990" end="00:59:41.100" style="s2">at this point exactly so it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.720" end="00:59:42.840" style="s2">imagine that this would unfold without</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.100" end="00:59:45.300" style="s2">t-cell involvement and so that there</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.840" end="00:59:47.099" style="s2">would be some selective reactivity by</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.300" end="00:59:50.069" style="s2">these T cells</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.099" end="00:59:54.420" style="s2">the more important thing was that it</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.069" end="00:59:58.829" style="s2">appears exact I need my computer that no</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.420" end="01:00:01.769" style="s2">just chill some people appear to have</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.829" end="01:00:03.630" style="s2">reactivity who have never had SARS cove</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.769" end="01:00:05.339" style="s2">- now that could be one of a number of</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.630" end="01:00:07.229" style="s2">things it could be that they have had it</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.339" end="01:00:08.759" style="s2">and the tests are incorrect which is a</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.229" end="01:00:12.559" style="s2">possibility we should spend time on at</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.759" end="01:00:15.239" style="s2">some point but it is also possible that</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.559" end="01:00:18.930" style="s2">the reason that some people who&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.239" end="01:00:22.469" style="s2">contracted this virus do already have T</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.930" end="01:00:25.459" style="s2">cells that react circulating in their</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.469" end="01:00:27.859" style="s2">systems is exposure to prior</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.459" end="01:00:30.390" style="s2">coronaviruses especially the for</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.859" end="01:00:32.279" style="s2">circulating cold viruses so there are</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.390" end="01:00:34.619" style="s2">four corona viruses that circulate</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.279" end="01:00:36.900" style="s2">people get them regularly these are</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.619" end="01:00:38.549" style="s2">seasonal cold viruses and so to the</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.900" end="01:00:40.349" style="s2">extent that these are relatives an</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.549" end="01:00:43.049" style="s2">immune system that has seen these cold</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.349" end="01:00:46.529" style="s2">viruses then reacts with some</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.049" end="01:00:49.079" style="s2">specificity to Sarah&#39;s Cove - so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.529" end="01:00:51.539" style="s2">just put this up this is one of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.079" end="01:00:55.019" style="s2">papers that the science news report is</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.539" end="01:00:56.640" style="s2">responding to and I think that that is</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.019" end="01:00:59.269" style="s2">exactly the interesting possibility</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.640" end="01:01:01.829" style="s2">there especially in light of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.269" end="01:01:06.299" style="s2">unfortunate meme that is now beginning</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.829" end="01:01:08.099" style="s2">to circulate that corona viruses do</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.299" end="01:01:10.380" style="s2">great damage to humans but then they</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.099" end="01:01:12.089" style="s2">disappear right because SARS one seems</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.380" end="01:01:13.859" style="s2">to have disappeared and MERS seems to</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.089" end="01:01:16.109" style="s2">have disappeared well there are these</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.859" end="01:01:17.699" style="s2">four other circulating corona viruses</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.109" end="01:01:19.890" style="s2">probably many more than that but four</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.699" end="01:01:21.809" style="s2">named circulating corona viruses that</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.890" end="01:01:23.729" style="s2">produce the common cold that have been</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.809" end="01:01:25.469" style="s2">circulating for years they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.729" end="01:01:27.150" style="s2">disappear they&#39;re not just disappearing</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.469" end="01:01:31.859" style="s2">so is there something different about</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.150" end="01:01:34.380" style="s2">this one compared to SARS one and MERS</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.859" end="01:01:35.940" style="s2">versus the other corona viruses that are</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.380" end="01:01:37.289" style="s2">circulating and widespread and</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.940" end="01:01:38.910" style="s2">effectively endemic in the human</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.289" end="01:01:40.709" style="s2">population presumably there is something</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.910" end="01:01:44.489" style="s2">different but the idea that we are</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.709" end="01:01:47.339" style="s2">certain that this one is more like more</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.489" end="01:01:50.009" style="s2">likely to be like SARS one and MERS then</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.339" end="01:01:52.109" style="s2">like the higher number of endemic</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.009" end="01:01:53.720" style="s2">circulating current of viruses is seems</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.109" end="01:01:55.670" style="s2">like a very dangerous position</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.720" end="01:01:58.040" style="s2">well I think this actually brings us</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.670" end="01:02:00.110" style="s2">back full circle because one of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.040" end="01:02:03.610" style="s2">reasons that one might expect this to</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.110" end="01:02:06.440" style="s2">behave more like the common cold</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.610" end="01:02:08.900" style="s2">coronaviruses and less like the Tsar&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.440" end="01:02:12.250" style="s2">and MERS example that we have is that</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.900" end="01:02:15.200" style="s2">this one may have been turbocharged by</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.250" end="01:02:17.930" style="s2">human tinkering presumably with good</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.200" end="01:02:20.630" style="s2">intent but human tinkering that turned</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.930" end="01:02:24.410" style="s2">this into something that spreads like</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.630" end="01:02:27.380" style="s2">wildfire and so in some sense the reason</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.410" end="01:02:29.810" style="s2">that SARS and MERS died out is they were</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.380" end="01:02:32.000" style="s2">not particularly well adapted to leap</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.810" end="01:02:33.350" style="s2">between people that&#39;s obviously not what</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.000" end="01:02:36.830" style="s2">we&#39;re dealing here and to the extent</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.350" end="01:02:38.960" style="s2">that we might be dealing with a virus</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.830" end="01:02:42.290" style="s2">that has been induced to experiment at a</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.960" end="01:02:45.050" style="s2">high rate and therefore will quickly</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.290" end="01:02:47.570" style="s2">learn how to defeat measures that we</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.050" end="01:02:49.790" style="s2">deploy we may be in much more serious</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.570" end="01:02:52.070" style="s2">trouble and we should not take SARS and</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.790" end="01:02:53.810" style="s2">Marrissa as the expectation we certainly</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.070" end="01:02:55.540" style="s2">don&#39;t know enough to imagine that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.810" end="01:03:01.730" style="s2">the trajectory we&#39;re going to face here</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.540" end="01:03:04.370" style="s2">that&#39;s right all right have we covered</p>
