<p begin="00:01:53.280" end="00:01:56.960" style="s2">he&#39;s a very industrious man with an</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.280" end="00:01:58.399" style="s2">interesting past um</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.960" end="00:02:00.240" style="s2">and i hope we can learn more about that</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.399" end="00:02:03.600" style="s2">past um in</p>

<p begin="00:02:11.120" end="00:02:14.480" style="s2">he has one of the most compelling voices</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.800" end="00:02:16.959" style="s2">in the paths between</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.480" end="00:02:18.560" style="s2">humanities and heart sciences and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.959" end="00:02:20.560" style="s2">true</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.560" end="00:02:22.080" style="s2">in the true spirit of complexity science</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.560" end="00:02:23.040" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s what we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.080" end="00:02:25.599" style="s2">talk about</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.040" end="00:02:27.120" style="s2">uh today so without further ado i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.599" end="00:02:29.760" style="s2">hand it over to dave</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.120" end="00:02:31.200" style="s2">uh well maybe i can ask startup for the</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.760" end="00:02:32.239" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.200" end="00:02:36.239" style="s2">for you unless you have something</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.239" end="00:02:39.360" style="s2">prepared right off the bat if no</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.239" end="00:02:41.280" style="s2">okay go for it okay so</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.360" end="00:02:43.519" style="s2">i guess how how what would you describe</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.280" end="00:02:45.360" style="s2">your role in civilization as what</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.519" end="00:02:48.239" style="s2">what is your vocation what are you what</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.360" end="00:02:48.239" style="s2">do you call yourself</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.560" end="00:02:52.560" style="s2">uh that&#39;s a difficult one um</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.200" end="00:03:01.200" style="s2">i think what i&#39;m trying to do um overall</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.120" end="00:03:03.120" style="s2">is to bring a science-based approach to</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.200" end="00:03:05.280" style="s2">sense making</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.120" end="00:03:07.440" style="s2">all right and there are various reasons</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.280" end="00:03:10.239" style="s2">i think that&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.440" end="00:03:12.080" style="s2">but i mean let me just summarize i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.239" end="00:03:13.599" style="s2">think we ever lived in a fact-based</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.080" end="00:03:15.200" style="s2">society i think the idea</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.599" end="00:03:17.360" style="s2">we&#39;re in the post-fact society is</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.200" end="00:03:19.440" style="s2">actually nonsense yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.360" end="00:03:22.480" style="s2">we never lived in a fact-based society</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.440" end="00:03:25.280" style="s2">people normally delegate decision-making</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.480" end="00:03:25.760" style="s2">but really from the 1940s onwards we</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.280" end="00:03:28.720" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.760" end="00:03:30.239" style="s2">just assumed that the experts knew what</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.720" end="00:03:32.239" style="s2">they were doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.239" end="00:03:34.480" style="s2">and that really hasn&#39;t panned out for a</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.239" end="00:03:36.159" style="s2">lot of people so we&#39;re trying demagogues</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.480" end="00:03:38.720" style="s2">instead at the moment all right and</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.159" end="00:03:40.640" style="s2">that&#39;s going to get really nasty</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.720" end="00:03:42.400" style="s2">so from my point of view i think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.640" end="00:03:44.640" style="s2">a sort of rationality in the way</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.400" end="00:03:47.280" style="s2">we make decisions at an individual level</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.640" end="00:03:50.239" style="s2">a company levels of society level</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.280" end="00:03:52.720" style="s2">which we desperately need to find a new</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.239" end="00:03:56.000" style="s2">way of working for</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.720" end="00:03:58.080" style="s2">and from my point of view i think the</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.000" end="00:04:00.159" style="s2">the discovery of complexity science</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.080" end="00:04:00.879" style="s2">which happened more or less within my</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.159" end="00:04:04.159" style="s2">lifetime</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.879" end="00:04:06.159" style="s2">yeah um and it is</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.159" end="00:04:08.959" style="s2">i&#39;m running around a bit at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.159" end="00:04:10.720" style="s2">but alicia gerard and i once sat down</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.959" end="00:04:11.280" style="s2">this if you haven&#39;t read gerar&#39;s stuff</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.720" end="00:04:13.519" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.280" end="00:04:15.120" style="s2">on complexity she&#39;s one of the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.519" end="00:04:16.479" style="s2">authors and one of the best people i</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.120" end="00:04:18.320" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.479" end="00:04:20.160" style="s2">and we&#39;re both philosophers by</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.320" end="00:04:22.160" style="s2">background although i didn&#39;t do a</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.160" end="00:04:23.360" style="s2">doctorate under seal which she did so</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.160" end="00:04:26.639" style="s2">that&#39;s definitely one up</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.360" end="00:04:28.720" style="s2">all right we said one of the great</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.639" end="00:04:31.360" style="s2">things about complexity science</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.720" end="00:04:34.000" style="s2">is it allows multiple multiple</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.360" end="00:04:36.639" style="s2">incompatible ontological states to</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.000" end="00:04:36.639" style="s2">coexist</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.040" end="00:04:40.320" style="s2">and that actually resolves a hell of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.040" end="00:04:43.440" style="s2">lot of problems</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.320" end="00:04:45.840" style="s2">in philosophy so alyssia</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.440" end="00:04:47.919" style="s2">um famously in a book dynamics in action</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.840" end="00:04:51.680" style="s2">resolves the old dilemma</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.919" end="00:04:53.919" style="s2">of when is a winker blink and i spent</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.680" end="00:04:55.440" style="s2">a term of my life at university writing</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.919" end="00:04:56.639" style="s2">essays about that</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.440" end="00:04:58.320" style="s2">and it&#39;s kind of like an important</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.639" end="00:05:00.000" style="s2">distinction if you don&#39;t get it right in</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.320" end="00:05:00.800" style="s2">a bar late at night you might get your</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.000" end="00:05:03.840" style="s2">face slapped</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.800" end="00:05:05.840" style="s2">right so and it&#39;s a problem with</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.840" end="00:05:08.880" style="s2">intentionality</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.840" end="00:05:10.000" style="s2">yeah so intentionality free will once</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.880" end="00:05:11.759" style="s2">you start to realize</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.000" end="00:05:13.280" style="s2">there are systems which have inherent</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.759" end="00:05:15.520" style="s2">uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.280" end="00:05:17.840" style="s2">and critically don&#39;t have material</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.520" end="00:05:20.080" style="s2">linear your causality</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.840" end="00:05:22.479" style="s2">you start to get a very different basis</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.080" end="00:05:25.600" style="s2">on which you make decisions</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.479" end="00:05:26.320" style="s2">and my definition of sense making is how</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.600" end="00:05:28.479" style="s2">do we make</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.320" end="00:05:30.560" style="s2">sense of the world so that we can act in</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.479" end="00:05:34.320" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.560" end="00:05:37.280" style="s2">now um overall it&#39;s now recognized as</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.320" end="00:05:39.919" style="s2">one of the five schools of sense making</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.280" end="00:05:40.479" style="s2">um i mean the great granddaddy of all of</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.919" end="00:05:44.639" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.479" end="00:05:45.840" style="s2">is carl vike um vipe really comes out of</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.639" end="00:05:48.080" style="s2">the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.840" end="00:05:50.720" style="s2">u.s sociological tradition it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.080" end="00:05:53.120" style="s2">about retrospective coherence</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.720" end="00:05:54.960" style="s2">it&#39;s observational derivation of theory</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.120" end="00:05:58.000" style="s2">and i&#39;ll come back to why i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.960" end="00:05:58.319" style="s2">didn&#39;t take that approach here um you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.000" end="00:06:01.919" style="s2">got</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.319" end="00:06:03.919" style="s2">dervin who comes from library science</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.919" end="00:06:05.199" style="s2">have a huge amount of respect for brenda</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.919" end="00:06:07.199" style="s2">and some of the time i&#39;ve spent</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.199" end="00:06:09.120" style="s2">with her has been you know some of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.199" end="00:06:11.680" style="s2">treasured times of my life</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.120" end="00:06:13.120" style="s2">both in frisco and her to home she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.680" end="00:06:14.880" style="s2">really coming from an information</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.120" end="00:06:18.000" style="s2">science post-modernist background</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.880" end="00:06:20.000" style="s2">yeah in terms of the way she thinks and</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.000" end="00:06:21.840" style="s2">you&#39;ve got gary klein who i can also</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.000" end="00:06:23.919" style="s2">count as a friend in fact i used a lot</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.840" end="00:06:25.840" style="s2">of work from gary cline</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.919" end="00:06:27.840" style="s2">um who is kind of like into the whole</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.840" end="00:06:29.479" style="s2">mantle models thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.840" end="00:06:33.360" style="s2">he was the guy who discovered</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.479" end="00:06:36.080" style="s2">experimentally how people make decisions</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.360" end="00:06:38.000" style="s2">which is a key part of my work yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.080" end="00:06:39.360" style="s2">through observation of firefighters and</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.000" end="00:06:41.280" style="s2">aircraft guys</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.360" end="00:06:43.199" style="s2">so he was a gun guy who discovered</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.280" end="00:06:45.840" style="s2">experimentally the pattern basis of</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.199" end="00:06:48.720" style="s2">human decision making</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.840" end="00:06:50.479" style="s2">so we scan and and i can now go into the</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.720" end="00:06:51.759" style="s2">harder science on this gary did it</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.479" end="00:06:53.360" style="s2">observationally</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.759" end="00:06:55.520" style="s2">i did it by talking with a whole bunch</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.360" end="00:06:58.000" style="s2">of cognitive neuroscientists</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.520" end="00:07:00.080" style="s2">we scan about five percent of the data</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.000" end="00:07:02.319" style="s2">that&#39;s available to us on a good day if</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.080" end="00:07:06.080" style="s2">we&#39;re really focused</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.319" end="00:07:09.360" style="s2">um normally it&#39;s a lot less than that</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.080" end="00:07:12.000" style="s2">if you&#39;re chinese the figure doubles</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.360" end="00:07:13.680" style="s2">um typically really focus somebody from</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.000" end="00:07:17.120" style="s2">a chinese background</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.680" end="00:07:19.680" style="s2">will actually scan about 10 um</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.120" end="00:07:21.759" style="s2">we think the evolutionary difference for</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.680" end="00:07:22.000" style="s2">that is the difference between symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.759" end="00:07:24.960" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.000" end="00:07:26.880" style="s2">literal languages so in if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.960" end="00:07:28.800" style="s2">speaking mandarin you have to understand</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.880" end="00:07:31.199" style="s2">the context of every symbol to</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.800" end="00:07:33.120" style="s2">know what it means so if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.199" end="00:07:35.039" style="s2">some of the other experiments on this</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.120" end="00:07:36.639" style="s2">chinese students shown a picture of a</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.039" end="00:07:37.919" style="s2">tiger drinking from a stream in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.639" end="00:07:40.000" style="s2">forest</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.919" end="00:07:41.520" style="s2">we&#39;ll remember the forest and will often</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.000" end="00:07:43.520" style="s2">miss the tiger</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.520" end="00:07:45.120" style="s2">american students will nearly always see</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.520" end="00:07:47.680" style="s2">the tiger and mr forrest</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.120" end="00:07:48.400" style="s2">it&#39;s like a context object the</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.680" end="00:07:52.400" style="s2">difference</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.400" end="00:07:54.160" style="s2">yeah so if we take the epigenetic effect</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.400" end="00:07:56.240" style="s2">of language we know that&#39;s sort of been</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.160" end="00:07:58.400" style="s2">built into biology</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.240" end="00:08:00.000" style="s2">right so we can see that difference but</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.400" end="00:08:02.000" style="s2">you know for all human beings whatever</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.000" end="00:08:04.080" style="s2">background we&#39;re scanning a fragment of</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.000" end="00:08:06.400" style="s2">what&#39;s available to us</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.080" end="00:08:08.560" style="s2">and we then do a first fit pattern match</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.400" end="00:08:11.840" style="s2">with previous experience</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.560" end="00:08:14.160" style="s2">uh not a best fit to first</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.840" end="00:08:16.080" style="s2">all right and this is called this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.160" end="00:08:17.360" style="s2">combo stuff this is called conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.080" end="00:08:20.560" style="s2">blending</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.360" end="00:08:23.199" style="s2">what we do is we take a partial stimulus</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.560" end="00:08:23.840" style="s2">and then we blend it together with</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.199" end="00:08:26.720" style="s2">various</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.840" end="00:08:28.080" style="s2">memories yeah and extended memories and</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.720" end="00:08:30.639" style="s2">group memories</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.080" end="00:08:33.039" style="s2">which are triggered by that observation</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.639" end="00:08:36.479" style="s2">and we blend together those memories</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.039" end="00:08:38.479" style="s2">and decide what to do and that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.479" end="00:08:40.320" style="s2">all human beings make decisions unless</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.479" end="00:08:42.320" style="s2">they&#39;re fully autistic</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.320" end="00:08:44.000" style="s2">at which point they scan everything and</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.320" end="00:08:46.720" style="s2">they can&#39;t cope</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.000" end="00:08:48.800" style="s2">that literally can&#39;t go yeah and because</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.720" end="00:08:51.519" style="s2">the volume overload</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.800" end="00:08:53.519" style="s2">now you can see why this happens in</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.519" end="00:08:55.680" style="s2">evolutionary terms if you think about</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.519" end="00:08:56.880" style="s2">the early hominoids on the savannas of</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.680" end="00:08:59.519" style="s2">africa</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.880" end="00:09:01.120" style="s2">or possibly the south the mediterranean</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.519" end="00:09:02.240" style="s2">sea they&#39;re starting to get disputed at</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.120" end="00:09:04.320" style="s2">the moment</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.240" end="00:09:06.080" style="s2">um something large in yellow with very</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.320" end="00:09:07.760" style="s2">sharp teeth runs towards you at high</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.080" end="00:09:09.839" style="s2">speed</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.760" end="00:09:11.600" style="s2">do you want to autistically scan all</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.839" end="00:09:13.760" style="s2">available data</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.600" end="00:09:16.320" style="s2">look up a catalogue of the flora and</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.760" end="00:09:19.040" style="s2">fauna of the african belt</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.320" end="00:09:20.800" style="s2">and have an identified lion look at best</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.040" end="00:09:22.640" style="s2">practice case studies on how to deal</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.800" end="00:09:25.040" style="s2">with lions yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.640" end="00:09:26.640" style="s2">uh by that time the only document of any</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.040" end="00:09:28.399" style="s2">use to you will be the book of jonah</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.640" end="00:09:30.640" style="s2">from the old testament</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.399" end="00:09:32.320" style="s2">which is the only written example i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.640" end="00:09:34.800" style="s2">found of how to escape from the</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.320" end="00:09:38.240" style="s2">digestive tract of a large carnival</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.800" end="00:09:40.800" style="s2">yet written by a purported survivor</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.240" end="00:09:43.040" style="s2">so we evolved to make decisions very</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.800" end="00:09:44.160" style="s2">very quickly based on a partial data</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.040" end="00:09:48.240" style="s2">scan</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.160" end="00:09:51.040" style="s2">privilege in our most recent experiences</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.240" end="00:09:52.640" style="s2">now if that&#39;s the way we make decisions</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.040" end="00:09:56.160" style="s2">what patterns we use</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.640" end="00:09:57.120" style="s2">are then critical and what i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.160" end="00:09:58.959" style="s2">probably do on</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.120" end="00:10:00.720" style="s2">the third one of these is talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.959" end="00:10:02.399" style="s2">work we&#39;re doing with distributed</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.720" end="00:10:04.959" style="s2">ethnography</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.399" end="00:10:06.959" style="s2">um effectively to present multiple</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.959" end="00:10:09.920" style="s2">patterns</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.959" end="00:10:11.600" style="s2">right so that we can actually pre-filter</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.920" end="00:10:13.200" style="s2">the data</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.600" end="00:10:15.839" style="s2">by presenting things from different</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.200" end="00:10:17.440" style="s2">perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.839" end="00:10:19.200" style="s2">i mean the other famous experiment on</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.440" end="00:10:20.160" style="s2">this which i referenced in the april</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.200" end="00:10:24.480" style="s2">talk is the</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.160" end="00:10:27.360" style="s2">the radiologists given a batch of x-rays</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.480" end="00:10:29.360" style="s2">asked to scan for anomalies and on the</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.360" end="00:10:31.600" style="s2">final x-ray a picture of a gorilla</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.360" end="00:10:34.079" style="s2">is placed in plain sight which is 48</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.600" end="00:10:36.959" style="s2">times the size of a cancer nodule</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.079" end="00:10:38.560" style="s2">and on average 83 of radiologists don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.959" end="00:10:40.720" style="s2">see it even though their eyes physically</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.560" end="00:10:42.560" style="s2">scan it</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.720" end="00:10:44.800" style="s2">they do not see what they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.560" end="00:10:46.800" style="s2">expecting to see</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.800" end="00:10:48.880" style="s2">now most of the time this makes perfect</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.800" end="00:10:51.360" style="s2">sense it&#39;s very rarely that people have</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.880" end="00:10:53.440" style="s2">miniature gorillas in their lungs</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.360" end="00:10:56.000" style="s2">and therefore it&#39;s unlikely to occur</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.440" end="00:10:57.920" style="s2">anyway right so</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.000" end="00:11:00.000" style="s2">we need to realize and this is another</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.920" end="00:11:01.360" style="s2">coming back decline klein argues very</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.000" end="00:11:04.079" style="s2">strongly we shouldn&#39;t talk about</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.360" end="00:11:05.519" style="s2">cognitive biases i agree with him</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.079" end="00:11:07.600" style="s2">we should talk about cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.519" end="00:11:09.760" style="s2">heuristics</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.600" end="00:11:12.000" style="s2">uh evolution doesn&#39;t throw out things</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.760" end="00:11:14.240" style="s2">which don&#39;t have utility</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.000" end="00:11:15.920" style="s2">yeah so if you look at all the so-called</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.240" end="00:11:18.000" style="s2">cognitive biases</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.920" end="00:11:20.160" style="s2">they&#39;re all about reducing the energy</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.000" end="00:11:22.720" style="s2">cost of making decisions</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.160" end="00:11:24.079" style="s2">and on average they can like pan out</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.720" end="00:11:26.959" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.079" end="00:11:28.320" style="s2">and reduction of energy cost is critical</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.959" end="00:11:29.839" style="s2">in evolution</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.320" end="00:11:31.519" style="s2">and particularly for humans because our</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.839" end="00:11:32.959" style="s2">brain takes up so much energy</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.519" end="00:11:35.040" style="s2">disproportionate</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.959" end="00:11:36.480" style="s2">in many ways to its utility that we have</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.040" end="00:11:40.000" style="s2">a problem</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.480" end="00:11:41.839" style="s2">so klein&#39;s klein discovered that in</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.000" end="00:11:43.519" style="s2">terms of the way that people did mental</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.839" end="00:11:45.600" style="s2">rehearsal</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.519" end="00:11:46.800" style="s2">and this contradicts some of white&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.600" end="00:11:49.040" style="s2">work because</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.800" end="00:11:50.639" style="s2">klein and vike both work with what are</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.040" end="00:11:52.320" style="s2">called crews</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.639" end="00:11:53.760" style="s2">i people in mission critical</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.320" end="00:11:56.240" style="s2">environments</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.760" end="00:11:58.480" style="s2">and my own work basically argues that</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.240" end="00:11:59.600" style="s2">the ritualization of becoming a crew</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.480" end="00:12:02.480" style="s2">member</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.600" end="00:12:04.480" style="s2">creates a cognitive trigger which</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.480" end="00:12:06.240" style="s2">actually defines the way in which you</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.480" end="00:12:08.480" style="s2">scan data</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.240" end="00:12:10.880" style="s2">and the original project we did on that</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.480" end="00:12:14.000" style="s2">was way back in new zealand</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.880" end="00:12:15.040" style="s2">and where we were looking at safety and</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.000" end="00:12:16.720" style="s2">lorry drivers</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.040" end="00:12:18.800" style="s2">sorry truck drivers for the americans</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.720" end="00:12:20.639" style="s2">amongst you</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.800" end="00:12:23.360" style="s2">and we did that this was distributed</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.639" end="00:12:26.480" style="s2">ethnography so we put</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.360" end="00:12:30.079" style="s2">students into the cabs um</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.480" end="00:12:31.839" style="s2">for three weeks gathering narrative on a</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.079" end="00:12:33.600" style="s2">continuous basis and i&#39;ll talk more</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.839" end="00:12:36.480" style="s2">about this in in the third</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.600" end="00:12:37.040" style="s2">session yeah and how we do that key</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.480" end="00:12:38.880" style="s2">thing is</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.040" end="00:12:40.800" style="s2">this is a quantitative approach not a</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.880" end="00:12:43.279" style="s2">qualitative approach</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.800" end="00:12:44.639" style="s2">yeah my background is in physics i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.279" end="00:12:48.000" style="s2">buy qual</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.639" end="00:12:50.240" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s you know quant matters right</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.000" end="00:12:52.000" style="s2">and no social scientist ever has enough</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.240" end="00:12:54.480" style="s2">data to form any valid conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.000" end="00:12:57.839" style="s2">whatsoever so kind of like we&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.480" end="00:12:59.600" style="s2">at increasing the volume of data</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.839" end="00:13:00.880" style="s2">so if i&#39;ve got students act as</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.600" end="00:13:02.639" style="s2">ethnographers in direct</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.880" end="00:13:05.839" style="s2">observation of camp drivers i can get a</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.639" end="00:13:08.639" style="s2">lot of data very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.839" end="00:13:11.120" style="s2">and the principle was simple the lorry</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.639" end="00:13:12.959" style="s2">driver could ask</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.120" end="00:13:14.720" style="s2">just assume truck driver if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.959" end="00:13:16.079" style="s2">get it i need to go back to vernacular</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.720" end="00:13:18.480" style="s2">at this time of night right</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.079" end="00:13:20.240" style="s2">so the lorry driver you know could ask</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.480" end="00:13:21.600" style="s2">the student to do anything which was</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.240" end="00:13:22.639" style="s2">legal we thought we&#39;d put that</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.600" end="00:13:26.240" style="s2">qualification in</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.639" end="00:13:26.720" style="s2">right and in return for which kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.240" end="00:13:28.480" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.720" end="00:13:30.399" style="s2">you know that helped that built a</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.480" end="00:13:31.600" style="s2">relationship so they started to own</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.399" end="00:13:33.360" style="s2">things up</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.600" end="00:13:35.360" style="s2">now that was a fascinating project one</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.360" end="00:13:38.880" style="s2">is we found that amphetamine use was</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.360" end="00:13:41.519" style="s2">about three times what people thought</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.880" end="00:13:43.040" style="s2">and it turned out the main modulating</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.519" end="00:13:45.760" style="s2">factor behind and i&#39;m going to use</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.040" end="00:13:47.920" style="s2">modulator rather than cause generally</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.760" end="00:13:49.360" style="s2">the main modulating factor behind</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.920" end="00:13:52.320" style="s2">amphetamine use was</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.360" end="00:13:54.880" style="s2">actually the tachograph so it was the</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.320" end="00:13:56.639" style="s2">device designed to control how you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.880" end="00:13:59.839" style="s2">how many hours people drive which was</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.639" end="00:13:59.839" style="s2">meant to make them safer</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.920" end="00:14:04.000" style="s2">was actually producing crazy behavior</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.399" end="00:14:05.920" style="s2">because if they hit within a certain</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.000" end="00:14:07.199" style="s2">margin they just had to stop us leaking</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.920" end="00:14:08.320" style="s2">the cap</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.199" end="00:14:10.160" style="s2">you know when they could have gone on</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.320" end="00:14:12.320" style="s2">for like 10 minutes and stayed somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.160" end="00:14:15.920" style="s2">comfortable but they couldn&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.320" end="00:14:18.079" style="s2">because of the physical record yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.920" end="00:14:20.560" style="s2">so that was interesting but</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.079" end="00:14:22.720" style="s2">we also and it parallels work we&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.560" end="00:14:24.959" style="s2">on safety in the northeast of england</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.720" end="00:14:26.639" style="s2">which shows the main reason for mental</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.959" end="00:14:28.959" style="s2">breakdown is the health and safety</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.639" end="00:14:30.480" style="s2">regulation not the job</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.959" end="00:14:32.320" style="s2">and that&#39;s working with what we call</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.480" end="00:14:35.360" style="s2">blue light services</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.320" end="00:14:37.120" style="s2">yeah because basically any formal system</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.360" end="00:14:40.160" style="s2">and i now come into</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.120" end="00:14:41.839" style="s2">the complexity thing any formal system</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.160" end="00:14:43.920" style="s2">assumes you&#39;re in the center of a normal</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.839" end="00:14:46.079" style="s2">distribution</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.920" end="00:14:47.760" style="s2">whereas a substantial amount of life</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.079" end="00:14:50.399" style="s2">happens in the tails of a pareto</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.760" end="00:14:50.399" style="s2">distribution</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.720" end="00:14:54.320" style="s2">so if you look at hospital safety</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.720" end="00:14:55.519" style="s2">procedures they&#39;re based on single</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.320" end="00:14:57.480" style="s2">morbidity</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.519" end="00:14:59.199" style="s2">but most entries into and</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.480" end="00:15:00.959" style="s2">multi-morbidity</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.199" end="00:15:04.399" style="s2">and that that changes effectively the</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.959" end="00:15:04.399" style="s2">distribution pattern the risk</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.800" end="00:15:09.120" style="s2">so we found that but then we also found</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.800" end="00:15:11.920" style="s2">that somewhere in the region of</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.120" end="00:15:13.199" style="s2">80 percent of the accidents the off-road</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.920" end="00:15:14.959" style="s2">accidents</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.199" end="00:15:17.519" style="s2">were actually happening in the first 10</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.959" end="00:15:18.720" style="s2">to 15 minutes after a lorry arrived at</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.519" end="00:15:20.959" style="s2">the harbour</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.720" end="00:15:22.720" style="s2">and the driver started to unload the</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.959" end="00:15:25.279" style="s2">lorry</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.720" end="00:15:26.000" style="s2">now nobody attracted that level of data</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.279" end="00:15:29.680" style="s2">before but</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.000" end="00:15:31.440" style="s2">that was significant and we speculated</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.680" end="00:15:32.639" style="s2">and later proved that the reason was</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.440" end="00:15:35.920" style="s2">very simple</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.639" end="00:15:37.920" style="s2">they&#39;ve been driving for 100 200 miles</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.920" end="00:15:39.440" style="s2">yeah so the cognitive activation</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.920" end="00:15:40.800" style="s2">patterns the patterns through which they</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.440" end="00:15:43.279" style="s2">were scanning</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.800" end="00:15:45.839" style="s2">or filtering available data were</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.279" end="00:15:48.160" style="s2">effectively driver patterns</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.839" end="00:15:51.839" style="s2">and it was taking the brain 10 to 15</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.160" end="00:15:53.199" style="s2">minutes to reset itself as a loader</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.839" end="00:15:55.040" style="s2">and therefore they were having the</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.199" end="00:15:56.480" style="s2">classic sort of weightlifting type</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.040" end="00:15:58.639" style="s2">accidents</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.480" end="00:16:01.360" style="s2">and the intervention we did there which</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.639" end="00:16:04.000" style="s2">catch accidents by two-thirds</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.360" end="00:16:05.120" style="s2">was we got them all to strap on a heated</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.000" end="00:16:08.240" style="s2">weight lifters belt</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.120" end="00:16:09.680" style="s2">before they unpacked the lorry so we</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.240" end="00:16:11.440" style="s2">created a ritual</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.680" end="00:16:14.399" style="s2">to switch them from being driver to</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.440" end="00:16:16.079" style="s2">loader and it was a physical ritual as</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.399" end="00:16:17.199" style="s2">well that strapping on changed their</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.079" end="00:16:19.279" style="s2">stance</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.199" end="00:16:20.880" style="s2">and we associated the training with</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.279" end="00:16:22.639" style="s2">strapping on the belt so there was only</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.880" end="00:16:25.759" style="s2">one rule you don&#39;t unload to</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.639" end="00:16:27.199" style="s2">strap on the belt yeah and because it</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.759" end="00:16:28.959" style="s2">had heated gel pads</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.199" end="00:16:30.240" style="s2">everybody wanted to strap it on anyway</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.959" end="00:16:31.519" style="s2">because it was a really nice feeling</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.240" end="00:16:35.199" style="s2">when you did it</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.519" end="00:16:35.199" style="s2">and that made a significant difference</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.279" end="00:16:39.759" style="s2">now that to me is quite important</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.759" end="00:16:40.639" style="s2">because klein&#39;s work identified that as</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.759" end="00:16:43.120" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.639" end="00:16:44.880" style="s2">vike tends to work tends to generalize</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.120" end="00:16:46.720" style="s2">from the particular and this is a key</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.880" end="00:16:49.120" style="s2">complexity principle</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.720" end="00:16:51.759" style="s2">complexity recognizes that most things</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.120" end="00:16:53.519" style="s2">are context specific</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.759" end="00:16:56.320" style="s2">whereas the dominant approach in</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.519" end="00:16:58.639" style="s2">management science until complexity long</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.320" end="00:17:00.880" style="s2">complexity came along was to assume</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.639" end="00:17:03.279" style="s2">context free</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.880" end="00:17:05.439" style="s2">so this is where i&#39;m gonna maybe or</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.279" end="00:17:07.600" style="s2">maybe not get controversial but i really</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.439" end="00:17:10.000" style="s2">don&#39;t apologize if i upset anybody with</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.600" end="00:17:12.559" style="s2">this i&#39;m happy to defend it all right</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.000" end="00:17:13.360" style="s2">um what you actually see is people go</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.559" end="00:17:15.439" style="s2">and you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.360" end="00:17:18.240" style="s2">and invite did this a lot so if you look</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.439" end="00:17:19.679" style="s2">at ficanzatcliff on on</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.240" end="00:17:21.520" style="s2">forgotten name of the book he&#39;s got a</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.679" end="00:17:24.400" style="s2">yellow cover</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.520" end="00:17:25.199" style="s2">it&#39;s on mission critical systems anyway</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.400" end="00:17:27.199" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.199" end="00:17:28.720" style="s2">and i think vik is a lot better when he</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.199" end="00:17:30.720" style="s2">writes on his own i think when he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.720" end="00:17:32.640" style="s2">writing with subcliff</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.720" end="00:17:34.640" style="s2">the quality goes down a lot but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.640" end="00:17:38.559" style="s2">just a personal opinion</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.640" end="00:17:41.200" style="s2">um but basically what he does he studies</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.559" end="00:17:43.039" style="s2">people like aircraft carriers and</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.200" end="00:17:46.640" style="s2">firefighters</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.039" end="00:17:48.799" style="s2">um with the intent of discovering</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.640" end="00:17:49.760" style="s2">what their characteristics are which</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.799" end="00:17:53.120" style="s2">cause them to</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.760" end="00:17:54.880" style="s2">share failure now anybody with any</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.120" end="00:17:56.720" style="s2">background in knowledge management</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.880" end="00:17:59.039" style="s2">knows that sharing failure is the most</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.720" end="00:18:00.559" style="s2">critical thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.039" end="00:18:02.400" style="s2">and it&#39;s the most difficult thing</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.559" end="00:18:04.080" style="s2">because there&#39;s more learning in failure</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.400" end="00:18:06.320" style="s2">than there is in success</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.080" end="00:18:08.160" style="s2">but the consequences of failure of hives</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.320" end="00:18:10.960" style="s2">so people won&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.160" end="00:18:11.840" style="s2">so if i discovered a group of people you</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.960" end="00:18:14.480" style="s2">know i say</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.840" end="00:18:16.559" style="s2">u.s navy personnel on carriers fire</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.480" end="00:18:18.880" style="s2">fighters</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.559" end="00:18:20.960" style="s2">who actually did share failures so he</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.880" end="00:18:22.480" style="s2">went and studied them identified things</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.960" end="00:18:24.080" style="s2">they had in common</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.480" end="00:18:25.840" style="s2">and that was what was written up as</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.080" end="00:18:27.520" style="s2">things you should do</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.840" end="00:18:29.120" style="s2">now i remember the first time i read</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.520" end="00:18:30.640" style="s2">that book and unfortunately i was at a</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.120" end="00:18:32.400" style="s2">conference with its authors so i</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.640" end="00:18:35.120" style="s2">probably shouldn&#39;t have said what i said</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.400" end="00:18:35.600" style="s2">um and i remember sending that i said</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.120" end="00:18:38.640" style="s2">but you</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.600" end="00:18:41.360" style="s2">you&#39;ve selected crews</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.640" end="00:18:43.200" style="s2">yeah you selected environments in which</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.360" end="00:18:45.200" style="s2">people wear uniform where they&#39;re highly</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.200" end="00:18:47.120" style="s2">ritualized</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.200" end="00:18:49.120" style="s2">yeah and i said i can replicate the</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.120" end="00:18:50.799" style="s2">behavior of firefighters if i burn the</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.120" end="00:18:52.480" style="s2">office down every morning but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.799" end="00:18:54.080" style="s2">probably not an acceptable management</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.480" end="00:18:56.240" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.080" end="00:18:57.679" style="s2">and just say that didn&#39;t go down very</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.240" end="00:19:00.480" style="s2">well right</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.679" end="00:19:02.880" style="s2">um but i stand by it right so this</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.480" end="00:19:05.039" style="s2">context of context free context specific</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.880" end="00:19:07.919" style="s2">one is a key one</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.039" end="00:19:09.520" style="s2">um an understanding of context is</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.919" end="00:19:12.799" style="s2">critical to actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.520" end="00:19:14.559" style="s2">any type of sense making right and</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.799" end="00:19:16.000" style="s2">you&#39;ve got i mean this is generally part</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.559" end="00:19:18.240" style="s2">of the property we&#39;ve got the confusion</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.000" end="00:19:20.960" style="s2">of correlation with causation which is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.240" end="00:19:22.880" style="s2">real problem in social science</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.960" end="00:19:25.360" style="s2">and the way i normally illustrate that</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.880" end="00:19:27.679" style="s2">is if wales which is the country i come</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.360" end="00:19:30.160" style="s2">from we have three million people</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.679" end="00:19:33.520" style="s2">if we want to increase the number of</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.160" end="00:19:35.440" style="s2">nobel prizes we win beheaded population</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.520" end="00:19:38.880" style="s2">then all we actually have to do is</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.440" end="00:19:40.480" style="s2">increase dark chocolate consumption</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.880" end="00:19:42.160" style="s2">because if you didn&#39;t know it dark</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.480" end="00:19:44.400" style="s2">chocolate consumption directly</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.160" end="00:19:45.760" style="s2">correlates with nobel prizes behead of</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.400" end="00:19:48.799" style="s2">population</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.760" end="00:19:50.799" style="s2">over the last 30 years worldwide and</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.799" end="00:19:53.600" style="s2">that&#39;s a much bigger sample than most</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.799" end="00:19:55.280" style="s2">social scientists ever work with</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.600" end="00:19:56.880" style="s2">and so it&#39;s kind of like a simple thing</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.280" end="00:19:58.320" style="s2">and it&#39;s quite pleasurable i quite like</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.880" end="00:20:00.640" style="s2">dark chocolate</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.320" end="00:20:02.480" style="s2">so you know we we start that process</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.640" end="00:20:05.919" style="s2">right so that confusion is</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.480" end="00:20:07.440" style="s2">is a real problem um so what i started</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.919" end="00:20:09.760" style="s2">to do and this was originally when i was</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.440" end="00:20:13.440" style="s2">in ibm research</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.760" end="00:20:16.320" style="s2">um was to focus instead on using natural</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.440" end="00:20:17.919" style="s2">science as a constraint</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.320" end="00:20:19.600" style="s2">you know i&#39;ll talk more about</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.919" end="00:20:21.520" style="s2">constraints</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.600" end="00:20:22.960" style="s2">um next time around when i talk about</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.520" end="00:20:25.520" style="s2">kinevin right</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.960" end="00:20:26.400" style="s2">because in complexity mapping</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.520" end="00:20:28.159" style="s2">constraints</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.400" end="00:20:30.400" style="s2">is probably the most important thing you</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.159" end="00:20:30.400" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.880" end="00:20:36.000" style="s2">because constraints are ordered aspects</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.000" end="00:20:38.320" style="s2">in general of a complex system and they</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.000" end="00:20:40.000" style="s2">can be managed and changed</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.320" end="00:20:41.440" style="s2">so one of the ways you actually manage a</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.000" end="00:20:43.840" style="s2">complex system is to change the</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.440" end="00:20:46.240" style="s2">constraints</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.840" end="00:20:49.120" style="s2">so what i decided to do was to accept</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.240" end="00:20:51.360" style="s2">natural science as a constraint</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.120" end="00:20:53.280" style="s2">this matches in with constructive theory</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.360" end="00:20:54.640" style="s2">and physics which is duecast and others</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.280" end="00:20:56.240" style="s2">at cambridge</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.640" end="00:20:58.000" style="s2">where they&#39;re trying to look at physics</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.240" end="00:21:00.559" style="s2">from a whole systems point of view</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.000" end="00:21:02.960" style="s2">rather than atomistic point of view</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.559" end="00:21:04.799" style="s2">and the example i always give is the</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.960" end="00:21:06.960" style="s2">moon and the satellite are both</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.799" end="00:21:08.559" style="s2">subject to the laws of gravity that acts</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.960" end="00:21:10.799" style="s2">as a constraint</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.559" end="00:21:12.960" style="s2">but the energy cost of putting up a</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.799" end="00:21:14.559" style="s2">satellite is a lot less than the energy</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.960" end="00:21:17.280" style="s2">cost of putting up the moon</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.559" end="00:21:18.080" style="s2">therefore that&#39;s more likely to happen</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.280" end="00:21:20.880" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.080" end="00:21:23.039" style="s2">what that translates into is what does</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.880" end="00:21:25.760" style="s2">natural science tell us about the nature</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.039" end="00:21:28.880" style="s2">of systems the nature of interactions</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.760" end="00:21:30.159" style="s2">the nature of human cognition yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.880" end="00:21:32.159" style="s2">that is a constraint</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.159" end="00:21:33.760" style="s2">we know that that gives us security</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.159" end="00:21:35.120" style="s2">things will operate within that</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.760" end="00:21:36.799" style="s2">constraint</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.120" end="00:21:38.159" style="s2">or without that constraint these</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.799" end="00:21:41.520" style="s2">constraints can be</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.159" end="00:21:44.960" style="s2">internal or external yeah endo</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.520" end="00:21:47.919" style="s2">against exoskeleton so basically</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.960" end="00:21:49.360" style="s2">within those constraints yeah we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.919" end="00:21:52.320" style="s2">a degree of</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.360" end="00:21:53.039" style="s2">predictability and then we can apply</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.320" end="00:21:55.200" style="s2">methods</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.039" end="00:21:57.600" style="s2">consistent with those constraints and</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.200" end="00:22:00.880" style="s2">then develop them in practice</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.600" end="00:22:04.000" style="s2">the old name for that is praxis yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.880" end="00:22:06.080" style="s2">interaction of theory with practice</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.000" end="00:22:07.919" style="s2">or is aristotle put it the interaction</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.080" end="00:22:09.360" style="s2">of saphir and pranesis</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.919" end="00:22:11.360" style="s2">you know practical wisdom with</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.360" end="00:22:13.200" style="s2">theoretical wisdom and you can&#39;t like me</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.360" end="00:22:15.200" style="s2">both</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.200" end="00:22:17.520" style="s2">so that was the general approach we</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.200" end="00:22:20.080" style="s2">adopted initially within ibm and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.520" end="00:22:23.919" style="s2">subsequently when i left ibm</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.080" end="00:22:26.000" style="s2">um which was about 16 years ago now</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.919" end="00:22:29.280" style="s2">in terms of setting up cognitive edge</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.000" end="00:22:32.400" style="s2">and then the canvas center</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.280" end="00:22:32.880" style="s2">so that allows you to do better decision</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.400" end="00:22:36.000" style="s2">making</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.880" end="00:22:37.280" style="s2">under conditions of uncertainty so</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.000" end="00:22:39.039" style="s2">the other point is if you live in</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.280" end="00:22:40.400" style="s2">uncertain times and</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.039" end="00:22:42.159" style="s2">one things i&#39;m going to talk about on</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.400" end="00:22:43.440" style="s2">the final session on this is the work</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.159" end="00:22:45.280" style="s2">i&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.440" end="00:22:47.039" style="s2">for the european union at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.280" end="00:22:48.400" style="s2">because i&#39;m writing their handbook on</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.039" end="00:22:51.360" style="s2">crisis management</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.400" end="00:22:54.320" style="s2">yeah using kinevic yeah and if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.360" end="00:22:56.400" style="s2">you know we live in very uncertain times</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.320" end="00:22:58.080" style="s2">what happened in the past is not going</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.400" end="00:23:01.120" style="s2">to give me predictive power for what</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.080" end="00:23:01.120" style="s2">will happen in the future</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.200" end="00:23:05.760" style="s2">yeah one of my favorite phrases is</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.760" end="00:23:09.520" style="s2">hindsight is very valuable</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.760" end="00:23:11.600" style="s2">but hindsight doesn&#39;t lead to foresight</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.520" end="00:23:14.320" style="s2">but i do know that i can&#39;t change the</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.600" end="00:23:17.760" style="s2">way that people make decisions</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.320" end="00:23:19.760" style="s2">so i can&#39;t make people be rational at an</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.760" end="00:23:22.000" style="s2">individual level</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.760" end="00:23:24.159" style="s2">i can&#39;t get rid of inattentional</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.000" end="00:23:27.120" style="s2">blindness</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.159" end="00:23:28.640" style="s2">yeah you will see what you expect to see</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.120" end="00:23:30.559" style="s2">and interestingly</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.640" end="00:23:32.240" style="s2">if you&#39;re part of the seventeen percent</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.559" end="00:23:33.919" style="s2">who do see the gorilla</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.240" end="00:23:37.600" style="s2">you come to believe you were wrong when</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.919" end="00:23:41.760" style="s2">you talk with the 83 percent who didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.600" end="00:23:44.080" style="s2">so if that&#39;s a scientific constraint</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.760" end="00:23:45.279" style="s2">then i need to build systems which make</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.080" end="00:23:48.400" style="s2">the 17</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.279" end="00:23:49.760" style="s2">visible before they talk to the 83</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.400" end="00:23:51.679" style="s2">percent</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.760" end="00:23:53.200" style="s2">and make that available to senior</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.679" end="00:23:54.960" style="s2">decision makers</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.200" end="00:23:56.320" style="s2">right so you see where i&#39;m going with</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.960" end="00:23:58.960" style="s2">this all right</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.320" end="00:24:00.320" style="s2">um i&#39;ve got something which i know which</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.960" end="00:24:02.320" style="s2">is true</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.320" end="00:24:04.640" style="s2">so i can build methods and tools</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.320" end="00:24:07.679" style="s2">associated with that</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.640" end="00:24:11.919" style="s2">the other thing which comes in here</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.679" end="00:24:14.080" style="s2">is a link between three bodies of theory</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.919" end="00:24:16.559" style="s2">one is the losing epistemology in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.080" end="00:24:19.039" style="s2">concept of an assemblage</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.559" end="00:24:21.120" style="s2">and that is becoming more and more</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.039" end="00:24:23.600" style="s2">important as a theoretical construct in</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.120" end="00:24:25.679" style="s2">the health sector at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.600" end="00:24:27.440" style="s2">uh in complexity something which is</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.679" end="00:24:29.600" style="s2">called a strange attractor which most</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.440" end="00:24:31.600" style="s2">people know is the lorenz butterfly</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.600" end="00:24:33.679" style="s2">so there&#39;s a nothing ever follows the</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.600" end="00:24:35.039" style="s2">same pathway but there is a pattern</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.679" end="00:24:37.919" style="s2">which you can recognize</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.039" end="00:24:39.360" style="s2">yeah and in narrative theory what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.919" end="00:24:42.159" style="s2">called a trope</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.360" end="00:24:44.240" style="s2">yeah i i really don&#39;t like the concept</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.159" end="00:24:46.320" style="s2">of memes</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.240" end="00:24:47.600" style="s2">um partly because i think dawkins is an</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.320" end="00:24:50.720" style="s2">idiot</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.600" end="00:24:52.720" style="s2">right um and i&#39;ve yet to find a single</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.720" end="00:24:54.320" style="s2">geneticist who takes him remotely</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.720" end="00:24:56.720" style="s2">seriously</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.320" end="00:24:58.840" style="s2">um i mean the idea that the gene is</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.720" end="00:25:00.080" style="s2">seeking to replicate itself is a form of</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.840" end="00:25:03.120" style="s2">anthropomorphization</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.080" end="00:25:04.480" style="s2">which is quite dangerous um and if</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.120" end="00:25:06.559" style="s2">anybody hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.480" end="00:25:08.880" style="s2">written read mary mitchelly&#39;s book</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.559" end="00:25:10.400" style="s2">science and poetry</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.880" end="00:25:12.240" style="s2">um she&#39;s one of the great british</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.400" end="00:25:14.240" style="s2">philosophers she&#39;s one of those group of</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.240" end="00:25:15.440" style="s2">female philosophers who were at oxford</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.240" end="00:25:17.440" style="s2">during the war</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.440" end="00:25:18.640" style="s2">when there weren&#39;t any males around</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.440" end="00:25:22.080" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole group of them</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.640" end="00:25:24.320" style="s2">yeah and scum midgley and others</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.080" end="00:25:26.240" style="s2">um dawkins actually changed the</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.320" end="00:25:29.120" style="s2">introduction to selfish gene to try and</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.240" end="00:25:31.039" style="s2">combat her attack on him</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.120" end="00:25:33.440" style="s2">because she basically said he was trying</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.039" end="00:25:35.200" style="s2">to create a biological justification for</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.440" end="00:25:39.039" style="s2">thatcher and reagan</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.200" end="00:25:42.159" style="s2">and he got quite upset by that um</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.039" end="00:25:43.679" style="s2">the reality is and and the mean metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.159" end="00:25:46.240" style="s2">comes across which is actually quite</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.679" end="00:25:48.559" style="s2">dangerous right there isn&#39;t a single</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.240" end="00:25:49.840" style="s2">story or narrative seeking to replicate</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.559" end="00:25:52.559" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.840" end="00:25:55.279" style="s2">um what we see in human decision makers</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.559" end="00:25:57.679" style="s2">is a whole body of anecdotes so</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.279" end="00:26:00.640" style="s2">i tell a story you tell a story i like</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.679" end="00:26:03.360" style="s2">your story so i tell similar stories</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.640" end="00:26:05.440" style="s2">yeah and on the internet that happens</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.360" end="00:26:08.320" style="s2">much faster</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.440" end="00:26:10.640" style="s2">yeah and then those stories form what in</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.320" end="00:26:13.440" style="s2">english is called a trope</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.640" end="00:26:15.520" style="s2">yeah and it reaches a critical mass and</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.440" end="00:26:18.000" style="s2">it goes through a phase shift</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.520" end="00:26:19.760" style="s2">and then the trope or the assemblage or</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.000" end="00:26:24.480" style="s2">the strange attractor</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.760" end="00:26:26.559" style="s2">exists independently of the storyteller</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.480" end="00:26:29.440" style="s2">yeah and people effectively get sucked</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.559" end="00:26:31.360" style="s2">into it yeah they can&#39;t escape from it</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.440" end="00:26:33.360" style="s2">and then they start to filter data</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.360" end="00:26:35.120" style="s2">because the assemblage is a cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.360" end="00:26:36.960" style="s2">activation pattern</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.120" end="00:26:38.720" style="s2">and this is the problem i keep trying to</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.960" end="00:26:40.640" style="s2">explain this i mean for my many and</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.720" end="00:26:42.799" style="s2">various sins i have to read trump&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.640" end="00:26:46.400" style="s2">tweets every morning</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.799" end="00:26:50.480" style="s2">um and what trump is doing</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.400" end="00:26:52.720" style="s2">is to just catalyze tropes</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.480" end="00:26:54.799" style="s2">he&#39;s not making a rational argument he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.720" end="00:26:56.400" style="s2">using key phrases effectively to</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.799" end="00:26:58.960" style="s2">capitalize the trope</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.400" end="00:27:00.080" style="s2">and every time a boston brahmin or a</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.960" end="00:27:02.480" style="s2">well-meaning liberal</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.080" end="00:27:06.080" style="s2">argues against him logically they make</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.480" end="00:27:09.360" style="s2">the trump more they make the trope worse</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.080" end="00:27:12.559" style="s2">because all of the things that they say</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.360" end="00:27:13.760" style="s2">the trope has has already evolved to</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.559" end="00:27:16.000" style="s2">deal with those</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.760" end="00:27:18.080" style="s2">as a conspiracy theory or as that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.000" end="00:27:21.600" style="s2">they say or they don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.080" end="00:27:24.720" style="s2">and so on and so forth yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.600" end="00:27:26.320" style="s2">now that was driven home to me um</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.720" end="00:27:28.320" style="s2">i don&#39;t think i told this story last</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.320" end="00:27:30.640" style="s2">time but it dares returning anyway</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.320" end="00:27:32.880" style="s2">so i was in during the last presidential</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.640" end="00:27:36.320" style="s2">election i was in california</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.880" end="00:27:37.600" style="s2">um having dinner with kent beck and got</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.320" end="00:27:40.640" style="s2">invited to a</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.600" end="00:27:42.559" style="s2">champagne or cyanide party uh which</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.640" end="00:27:44.880" style="s2">fortunately i didn&#39;t go to because if i</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.559" end="00:27:48.000" style="s2">had to drink the cyanide i think</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.880" end="00:27:51.279" style="s2">um and the next day i flew over to dc</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.000" end="00:27:52.559" style="s2">and got pulled into a crisis level</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.279" end="00:27:54.000" style="s2">meeting</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.559" end="00:27:55.840" style="s2">um i&#39;ve done a lot of work with the</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.000" end="00:27:56.320" style="s2">intelligence community over the years in</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.840" end="00:27:57.840" style="s2">fact</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.320" end="00:28:00.000" style="s2">all of this stuff started when i was</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.840" end="00:28:02.000" style="s2">working with john poindexter</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.000" end="00:28:04.399" style="s2">um in darpa so i know a lot of those</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.000" end="00:28:07.440" style="s2">guys so i was a foreigner i was you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.399" end="00:28:07.840" style="s2">expert i got pulled in i&#39;ve never seen</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.440" end="00:28:10.559" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.840" end="00:28:12.399" style="s2">cia the fbi and the state department all</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.559" end="00:28:14.080" style="s2">worked together before in my life but</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.399" end="00:28:16.159" style="s2">they were all together now</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.080" end="00:28:18.080" style="s2">this was kind of like you know the sort</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.159" end="00:28:19.760" style="s2">of deep state in action</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.080" end="00:28:21.600" style="s2">and i think halfway through it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.760" end="00:28:23.360" style="s2">what the hell did we do i said well</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.600" end="00:28:24.960" style="s2">you guys just didn&#39;t make the case and</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.360" end="00:28:26.240" style="s2">they said you don&#39;t understand their bad</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.960" end="00:28:28.960" style="s2">it is</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.240" end="00:28:30.720" style="s2">so three of us got put into a helicopter</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.960" end="00:28:32.880" style="s2">and flown west i still don&#39;t know to</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.720" end="00:28:35.200" style="s2">this day where we went</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.880" end="00:28:37.679" style="s2">yeah and we were put in a lot given a</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.200" end="00:28:40.240" style="s2">higher cartel to drive 50 miles north</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.679" end="00:28:42.840" style="s2">and going to a designated bar</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.240" end="00:28:44.799" style="s2">um our cover story was we were european</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.840" end="00:28:47.039" style="s2">tourists</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.799" end="00:28:50.640" style="s2">and we were told to go into the bar and</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.039" end="00:28:50.640" style="s2">argue against trump</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.799" end="00:28:54.000" style="s2">and i remember they said to me you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.120" end="00:28:55.679" style="s2">don&#39;t worry about</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.000" end="00:28:57.520" style="s2">it you&#39;re quite safe we&#39;re going to have</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.679" end="00:29:00.159" style="s2">armed officers in the bar and i wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.520" end="00:29:03.200" style="s2">worried about it until they said that</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.159" end="00:29:04.799" style="s2">um so either way we go through this all</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.200" end="00:29:06.399" style="s2">right we go into the bar i&#39;ve drawn the</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.799" end="00:29:09.279" style="s2">short straw</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.399" end="00:29:09.679" style="s2">um there&#39;s an american football match</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.279" end="00:29:11.520" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.679" end="00:29:13.039" style="s2">on the television so i decided i&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.520" end="00:29:16.960" style="s2">to go down the sports route</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.039" end="00:29:18.880" style="s2">yeah um i&#39;m welsh all right we play a</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.960" end="00:29:21.200" style="s2">real sport called rugby you know it kind</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.880" end="00:29:21.919" style="s2">of like goes on for long periods of time</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.200" end="00:29:24.159" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.919" end="00:29:26.080" style="s2">offense has to become defense and you</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.159" end="00:29:28.240" style="s2">don&#39;t wear lots of padding</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.080" end="00:29:30.159" style="s2">so i&#39;m now playing the sort of male game</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.240" end="00:29:31.039" style="s2">here of that&#39;s not a real sport look at</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.159" end="00:29:33.840" style="s2">all the padding</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.039" end="00:29:34.720" style="s2">yeah and what you know you you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.840" end="00:29:36.000" style="s2">what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.720" end="00:29:37.840" style="s2">right in the course of that i</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.000" end="00:29:39.039" style="s2">established that i teach at west point</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.840" end="00:29:40.880" style="s2">which i do</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.039" end="00:29:42.399" style="s2">you know i teach just war theory at west</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.880" end="00:29:44.960" style="s2">point every now and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.399" end="00:29:46.480" style="s2">so that gave me credibility right and</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.960" end="00:29:48.159" style="s2">it&#39;s all going really well drinks have</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.480" end="00:29:51.600" style="s2">been bought you know it&#39;s classic</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.159" end="00:29:54.000" style="s2">male sort of bonding type stuff and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.600" end="00:29:56.159" style="s2">i started to use a socratic technique</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.000" end="00:29:58.720" style="s2">and the delight of philosophy is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.159" end="00:30:00.559" style="s2">trained in socratic questioning</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.720" end="00:30:02.480" style="s2">but you tend to forget what happened to</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.559" end="00:30:04.159" style="s2">socrates when the people of athens got</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.480" end="00:30:06.320" style="s2">fed up with it all right</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.159" end="00:30:08.960" style="s2">so i start the socratic technique and</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.320" end="00:30:12.480" style="s2">after i&#39;ve got him to contradict himself</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.960" end="00:30:13.840" style="s2">three times yeah this was their leader</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.480" end="00:30:15.679" style="s2">he walked away from the bar and</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.840" end="00:30:18.080" style="s2">everything&#39;s gone quiet now</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.679" end="00:30:19.919" style="s2">yeah and he turned around he put both</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.080" end="00:30:21.840" style="s2">hands up with two fingers</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.919" end="00:30:25.279" style="s2">and he said you you bastard that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.840" end="00:30:25.279" style="s2">your education talking</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.080" end="00:30:30.320" style="s2">yeah and i&#39;ve never forgotten that</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.760" end="00:30:33.840" style="s2">that&#39;s your education</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.320" end="00:30:36.799" style="s2">talking and i remember we then went back</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.840" end="00:30:40.000" style="s2">to dc and i said okay guys i get it now</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.799" end="00:30:42.080" style="s2">yeah this is a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.000" end="00:30:45.360" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a fundamental trope that</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.080" end="00:30:47.120" style="s2">people are not going to escape from</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.360" end="00:30:48.559" style="s2">now some of the things i&#39;ll talk about</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.120" end="00:30:49.120" style="s2">in the future session this is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.559" end="00:30:52.080" style="s2">like a</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.120" end="00:30:53.760" style="s2">general introduction to the field uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.080" end="00:30:56.799" style="s2">something in complexity which is called</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.760" end="00:30:59.279" style="s2">the adjacent possible</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.799" end="00:31:01.360" style="s2">so if you want to disrupt a deeply</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.279" end="00:31:03.760" style="s2">negative attractor</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.360" end="00:31:08.080" style="s2">then you find an adjacent attractor</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.760" end="00:31:09.840" style="s2">which is weaker and you make it stronger</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.080" end="00:31:14.320" style="s2">because then things will move across</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.840" end="00:31:14.320" style="s2">this is called vector theory of change</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.480" end="00:31:18.000" style="s2">so you don&#39;t say where you want to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.279" end="00:31:21.519" style="s2">you say</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.000" end="00:31:24.960" style="s2">we could go there next in fact one of</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.519" end="00:31:27.200" style="s2">the key lessons of complexity</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.960" end="00:31:28.320" style="s2">is that we start journeys with a sense</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.200" end="00:31:32.799" style="s2">of direction</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.320" end="00:31:34.480" style="s2">we don&#39;t have goals and that contradicts</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.799" end="00:31:35.919" style="s2">nearly everything which has come out of</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.480" end="00:31:39.360" style="s2">systems thinking for the past</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.919" end="00:31:42.159" style="s2">four decades which kind of like wants to</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.360" end="00:31:44.960" style="s2">have goals objectives vision statements</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.159" end="00:31:47.039" style="s2">purpose all these sort of phrases yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.960" end="00:31:50.799" style="s2">you can only have those if you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.039" end="00:31:53.200" style="s2">material linear causality</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.799" end="00:31:54.880" style="s2">yeah all of that implies that the future</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.200" end="00:31:57.919" style="s2">is definable</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.880" end="00:32:02.320" style="s2">um in a complex adaptive system</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.919" end="00:32:04.279" style="s2">you don&#39;t have linear material causality</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.320" end="00:32:05.840" style="s2">yeah you have don&#39;t even really have</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.279" end="00:32:08.240" style="s2">teleological</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.840" end="00:32:11.200" style="s2">causality either what you&#39;ve got is</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.240" end="00:32:14.000" style="s2">what&#39;s called dispositionality</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.200" end="00:32:15.279" style="s2">so i can say the current dispositional</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.000" end="00:32:18.480" style="s2">state of the system is</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.279" end="00:32:20.559" style="s2">x yeah and i can say</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.480" end="00:32:21.519" style="s2">these things are therefore unlikely to</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.559" end="00:32:23.440" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.519" end="00:32:24.960" style="s2">and these things are more likely to</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.440" end="00:32:27.519" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.960" end="00:32:28.000" style="s2">but i can never say this will happen or</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.519" end="00:32:31.360" style="s2">if we do</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.000" end="00:32:33.600" style="s2">this we will get that result</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.360" end="00:32:34.960" style="s2">so that leads into this key principle of</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.600" end="00:32:37.279" style="s2">complexity</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.960" end="00:32:39.760" style="s2">is we start journeys we don&#39;t try and</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.279" end="00:32:41.919" style="s2">achieve goals</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.760" end="00:32:43.279" style="s2">and if you start a journey with a sense</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.919" end="00:32:47.519" style="s2">of direction</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.279" end="00:32:49.519" style="s2">you&#39;re open to novelty on the pathway</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.519" end="00:32:51.919" style="s2">if you have very specific goals you</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.519" end="00:32:53.760" style="s2">don&#39;t see the things which create that</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.919" end="00:32:55.360" style="s2">and that&#39;s creating a whole new form of</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.760" end="00:32:58.000" style="s2">measurement</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.360" end="00:32:59.440" style="s2">i can get quite practical now there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.000" end="00:33:00.960" style="s2">thing called good hearts law which you</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.440" end="00:33:04.240" style="s2">might have come across</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.960" end="00:33:05.279" style="s2">um famous british economist good hearts</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.240" end="00:33:08.000" style="s2">law states</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.279" end="00:33:11.840" style="s2">that any statistical instrument used for</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.000" end="00:33:11.840" style="s2">policy loses all value</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.240" end="00:33:16.399" style="s2">that was rephrased by marilyn stratham</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.799" end="00:33:17.679" style="s2">who is a really fierce british</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.399" end="00:33:21.440" style="s2">anthropologist</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.679" end="00:33:23.519" style="s2">do not cross marilyn you won&#39;t live yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.440" end="00:33:27.120" style="s2">as the minute of measure becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.519" end="00:33:29.200" style="s2">target it ceases to be a measure</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.120" end="00:33:31.360" style="s2">because what you get is gaming behavior</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.200" end="00:33:33.519" style="s2">which is what you get with goals</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.360" end="00:33:35.200" style="s2">so the whole principle about starting</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.519" end="00:33:37.600" style="s2">journeys and seeking the adjacent</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.200" end="00:33:41.279" style="s2">possible like stepping stones</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.600" end="00:33:44.000" style="s2">and measuring that and a vector measure</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.279" end="00:33:47.039" style="s2">is direction and speed of travel for</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.000" end="00:33:47.039" style="s2">intensity of effort</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.440" end="00:33:50.880" style="s2">i&#39;ll repeat that a vector measure is</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.080" end="00:33:54.240" style="s2">direction</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.880" end="00:33:57.039" style="s2">and speed for energy</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.240" end="00:33:59.360" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a balance between those three</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.039" end="00:34:00.799" style="s2">we&#39;re now using that for example to</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.360" end="00:34:03.919" style="s2">measure</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.799" end="00:34:04.720" style="s2">um the impact of nurses on patient</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.919" end="00:34:08.960" style="s2">health</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.720" end="00:34:10.560" style="s2">in kobe because actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.960" end="00:34:12.399" style="s2">at the moment the average british</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.560" end="00:34:17.119" style="s2">hospital has</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.399" end="00:34:17.119" style="s2">over a thousand outcome based targets</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.280" end="00:34:22.399" style="s2">with 15 percent of them the money going</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.919" end="00:34:25.599" style="s2">on managing the measurement system</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.399" end="00:34:29.760" style="s2">rather than providing health care</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.599" end="00:34:32.560" style="s2">we can replace about 80 percent of those</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.760" end="00:34:34.879" style="s2">with patients keeping journals and</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.560" end="00:34:36.560" style="s2">nurses keeping journals</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.879" end="00:34:38.399" style="s2">measuring the attractor wells the</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.560" end="00:34:40.240" style="s2">dispositional states</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.399" end="00:34:42.800" style="s2">and measuring whether you&#39;re moving</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.240" end="00:34:46.240" style="s2">things in the right direction</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.800" end="00:34:48.480" style="s2">okay so when and that to my mind i mean</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.240" end="00:34:50.800" style="s2">the american equivalent of this is the</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.480" end="00:34:53.440" style="s2">educational system</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.800" end="00:34:54.159" style="s2">yeah in which measurement is destroying</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.440" end="00:34:56.800" style="s2">any hope</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.159" end="00:34:59.200" style="s2">for people from deprived backgrounds and</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.800" end="00:35:01.680" style="s2">i&#39;ve done a lot of field ethnography in</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.200" end="00:35:04.480" style="s2">the projects in new york</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.680" end="00:35:06.560" style="s2">and it&#39;s the formalism and the the</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.480" end="00:35:07.440" style="s2">measurement system of the educational</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.560" end="00:35:09.280" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.440" end="00:35:12.880" style="s2">which is designed to improve things</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.280" end="00:35:12.880" style="s2">which is actually holding people back</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.040" end="00:35:16.400" style="s2">it means teachers who actually inspire</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.520" end="00:35:19.040" style="s2">kids</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.400" end="00:35:22.160" style="s2">are generally punished teachers you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.040" end="00:35:24.880" style="s2">good at completing learning plans aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.160" end="00:35:26.720" style="s2">yeah another example on this i&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.880" end="00:35:29.200" style="s2">to stop and open up for questions yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.720" end="00:35:32.880" style="s2">this is kind of a general introduction</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.200" end="00:35:35.359" style="s2">my daughter who is now 31 an</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.880" end="00:35:37.440" style="s2">anthropologist and working for me</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.359" end="00:35:39.359" style="s2">which is quite scary because she also</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.440" end="00:35:40.480" style="s2">acts as a shop steward for all my other</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.359" end="00:35:43.040" style="s2">research assistants</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.480" end="00:35:45.119" style="s2">i get this phone call with addie&#39;s told</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.040" end="00:35:48.560" style="s2">us we&#39;re not to put up with this anymore</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.119" end="00:35:50.880" style="s2">and variations on the theme um</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.560" end="00:35:53.359" style="s2">but she&#39;s a she won the university prize</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.880" end="00:35:58.079" style="s2">for the best master&#39;s thesis</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.359" end="00:36:02.079" style="s2">um she wrote it on the on episode on</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.079" end="00:36:05.440" style="s2">uh assemblage theory strange attractors</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.079" end="00:36:07.119" style="s2">in the anthropology of male diabetes um</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.440" end="00:36:08.800" style="s2">and she&#39;s going on to mental health in</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.119" end="00:36:11.200" style="s2">those areas</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.800" end="00:36:14.720" style="s2">um either way so i lived with her</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.200" end="00:36:16.400" style="s2">through her ba and then her mma</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.720" end="00:36:18.560" style="s2">yeah and i hope one these days to live</p>

<p begin="00:36:18.560" end="00:36:21.760" style="s2">mental health</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.079" end="00:36:23.599" style="s2">and being as i was one of the subjects</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.760" end="00:36:25.200" style="s2">for a master&#39;s thesis so professors</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.599" end="00:36:26.480" style="s2">think she&#39;s waiting for me to become a</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.200" end="00:36:29.440" style="s2">subject for the</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.480" end="00:36:29.920" style="s2">phd right at least that&#39;s the standard</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.440" end="00:36:33.440" style="s2">joke</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.920" end="00:36:34.240" style="s2">right um and it was fun because it&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.440" end="00:36:36.560" style="s2">subject</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.240" end="00:36:38.160" style="s2">you know the internet means i can chat</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.560" end="00:36:39.760" style="s2">with her while she&#39;s in lectures i can</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.160" end="00:36:41.359" style="s2">feed the questions we have a lot of fun</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.760" end="00:36:43.680" style="s2">disrupting things yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.359" end="00:36:45.920" style="s2">in the way that fathers and daughters do</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.680" end="00:36:48.480" style="s2">but the first assay she wrote</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.920" end="00:36:50.560" style="s2">for when she was an undergraduate</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.480" end="00:36:52.880" style="s2">actually picked up the theme for which</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.560" end="00:36:54.320" style="s2">she won the university prize five years</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.880" end="00:36:57.359" style="s2">later</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.320" end="00:36:59.440" style="s2">but her assay failed</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.359" end="00:37:01.200" style="s2">and i still remember you know picking</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.440" end="00:37:02.640" style="s2">her up alright she was in tears and i</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.200" end="00:37:04.320" style="s2">said look ellie you wrote something</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.640" end="00:37:05.680" style="s2">original</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.320" end="00:37:07.440" style="s2">you&#39;re not allowed to do that at the</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.680" end="00:37:11.200" style="s2">undergraduate level</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.440" end="00:37:13.200" style="s2">yeah the lecturer has got a marking plan</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.200" end="00:37:15.200" style="s2">yeah and they&#39;re ticking you off against</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.200" end="00:37:16.880" style="s2">the marking plan and you have to work</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.200" end="00:37:18.160" style="s2">that out</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.880" end="00:37:20.079" style="s2">because that&#39;s the way you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.160" end="00:37:22.400" style="s2">get good essay grades</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.079" end="00:37:24.800" style="s2">and i said that&#39;s actually a really bad</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.400" end="00:37:26.640" style="s2">thing which has happened to education</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.800" end="00:37:27.839" style="s2">and i still remember the first essay i</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.640" end="00:37:29.920" style="s2">wrote um</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.839" end="00:37:31.760" style="s2">and this is british philosophy in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.920" end="00:37:33.839" style="s2">1970s</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.760" end="00:37:34.960" style="s2">and it got sent back and the professor</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.839" end="00:37:37.200" style="s2">had written on it</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.960" end="00:37:40.000" style="s2">this is metaphysics not philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.200" end="00:37:42.240" style="s2">please rewrite it</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.000" end="00:37:44.960" style="s2">so i sent it back with metaphysics his</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.240" end="00:37:46.880" style="s2">philosophy please mark it</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.960" end="00:37:48.640" style="s2">and we sort of carried on like that for</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.880" end="00:37:50.880" style="s2">three years right</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.640" end="00:37:52.079" style="s2">and i got quite a lot of a grades</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.880" end="00:37:53.839" style="s2">because i never</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.079" end="00:37:56.079" style="s2">broke the marketing plan i just had</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.839" end="00:37:57.599" style="s2">interesting ideas and i was a generalist</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.079" end="00:37:58.560" style="s2">so i was putting in things from other</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.599" end="00:38:00.079" style="s2">fields</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.560" end="00:38:02.000" style="s2">and they quite liked that because it</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.079" end="00:38:05.040" style="s2">livened up what that was otherwise a</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.000" end="00:38:08.480" style="s2">boring evening but i would not survive</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.040" end="00:38:10.240" style="s2">that in a modern university yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.480" end="00:38:12.160" style="s2">we&#39;re rewarding people who are game</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.240" end="00:38:13.599" style="s2">players and that means if i look at</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.160" end="00:38:14.560" style="s2">things like black lives matter and the</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.599" end="00:38:16.480" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.560" end="00:38:20.079" style="s2">we&#39;re actually rewarding people who are</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.480" end="00:38:22.079" style="s2">educated to pass educational games</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.079" end="00:38:24.000" style="s2">yeah rather than rewarding people who&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.079" end="00:38:26.560" style="s2">got original thoughts and can actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.000" end="00:38:28.800" style="s2">develop in different ways</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.560" end="00:38:30.240" style="s2">so i&#39;m coming back to where i started in</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.800" end="00:38:32.720" style="s2">the question</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.240" end="00:38:33.760" style="s2">what complexity theory does is it</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.720" end="00:38:35.680" style="s2">basically says</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.760" end="00:38:38.480" style="s2">most of the way that systems thinking</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.680" end="00:38:40.400" style="s2">has worked for the past three decades</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.480" end="00:38:42.320" style="s2">only applies where the level of</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.400" end="00:38:43.599" style="s2">constraint is such</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.320" end="00:38:45.839" style="s2">that you&#39;ve got a predictable</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.599" end="00:38:48.320" style="s2">relationship between cause and effect</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.839" end="00:38:49.920" style="s2">either system is ordered</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.320" end="00:38:52.640" style="s2">when you haven&#39;t got that level of</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.920" end="00:38:53.760" style="s2">constraint none of those methods apply</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.640" end="00:38:55.280" style="s2">anymore</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.760" end="00:38:57.200" style="s2">and you have to develop different</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.280" end="00:38:58.480" style="s2">methods and tools and that&#39;s where i</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.200" end="00:39:00.240" style="s2">focus</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.480" end="00:39:01.520" style="s2">so i&#39;ll come back to that definition i</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.240" end="00:39:04.079" style="s2">started with</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.520" end="00:39:06.160" style="s2">how do i make sense of the world so that</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.079" end="00:39:08.400" style="s2">i can act in it</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.160" end="00:39:10.640" style="s2">right now with that comes the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.400" end="00:39:14.000" style="s2">sufficiency</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.640" end="00:39:17.760" style="s2">so it&#39;s how do i know enough or how</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.000" end="00:39:20.000" style="s2">do i know when i know enough to act</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.760" end="00:39:21.839" style="s2">and of course the nature of the action</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.000" end="00:39:24.960" style="s2">could be anything from a definitive</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.839" end="00:39:28.160" style="s2">act to a series of parallel</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.960" end="00:39:29.599" style="s2">safe to failed experiments yeah to a</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.160" end="00:39:32.000" style="s2">mass engagement or</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.599" end="00:39:32.960" style="s2">what we call a sensor probe and i go</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.000" end="00:39:34.079" style="s2">through those when i go through</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.960" end="00:39:37.599" style="s2">connecting</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.079" end="00:39:39.760" style="s2">um next week yeah so that concept of</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.599" end="00:39:41.599" style="s2">what does it mean to act</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.760" end="00:39:44.160" style="s2">and what does it mean to know and when</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.599" end="00:39:45.560" style="s2">is that knowledge sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.160" end="00:39:48.640" style="s2">and the concept of being</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.560" end="00:39:50.320" style="s2">context-specific not context-free</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.640" end="00:39:52.240" style="s2">you know all of those are coming out of</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.320" end="00:39:55.280" style="s2">this basic complexity science-based</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.240" end="00:39:57.760" style="s2">approach to sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.280" end="00:39:59.599" style="s2">you know i&#39;ve spoken for 40 odd minutes</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.760" end="00:40:02.240" style="s2">there so it&#39;s definitely time for</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.599" end="00:40:03.599" style="s2">wider contribution and i forgot when did</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.240" end="00:40:06.319" style="s2">he stop by the way</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.599" end="00:40:08.000" style="s2">cahill when do we stop oh we&#39;re supposed</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.319" end="00:40:11.440" style="s2">to stop with three right</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.000" end="00:40:13.359" style="s2">but i guess i&#39;m relaxed</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.440" end="00:40:14.720" style="s2">okay no that was great that&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.359" end="00:40:16.880" style="s2">yes i haven&#39;t eaten that i haven&#39;t had</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.720" end="00:40:19.920" style="s2">the gin and tonic yet and it&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.880" end="00:40:22.400" style="s2">yeah no</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.920" end="00:40:23.280" style="s2">that was amazing um so much to chew on</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.400" end="00:40:25.520" style="s2">there wow</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.280" end="00:40:26.720" style="s2">i forgot to say it everyone that um you</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.520" end="00:40:28.000" style="s2">know you guys should put the questions</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.720" end="00:40:30.640" style="s2">in the chat but you guys</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.000" end="00:40:32.079" style="s2">already knew that and to keep it clean</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.640" end="00:40:34.800" style="s2">in the chats too</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.079" end="00:40:37.280" style="s2">um but yeah that was great i really like</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.800" end="00:40:39.760" style="s2">your emphasis on</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.280" end="00:40:41.359" style="s2">the relationship between nodes rather</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.760" end="00:40:42.480" style="s2">than the attributes of the nodes</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.359" end="00:40:45.920" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.480" end="00:40:48.640" style="s2">um i think that&#39;s a really key key point</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.920" end="00:40:50.400" style="s2">uh but yeah it&#39;s the key thing an</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.640" end="00:40:52.800" style="s2">organizational change and i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.400" end="00:40:54.560" style="s2">also an ethical thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.800" end="00:40:56.240" style="s2">every attempt people make to change</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.560" end="00:40:58.240" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.240" end="00:40:59.280" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s not going to work and be it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.240" end="00:41:01.200" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.280" end="00:41:02.800" style="s2">but changing how people connect is</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.200" end="00:41:06.319" style="s2">something which is ethically valid and</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.800" end="00:41:08.319" style="s2">will actually produce change faster</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.319" end="00:41:09.760" style="s2">yeah i actually have a selfish question</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.319" end="00:41:12.800" style="s2">because i&#39;m i&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.760" end="00:41:15.280" style="s2">i guess i&#39;m like an urbanist i guess or</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.800" end="00:41:16.000" style="s2">i like urban studies and uh one of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.280" end="00:41:17.760" style="s2">things that</p>

<p begin="00:41:46.000" end="00:41:49.520" style="s2">meritocratic</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.760" end="00:41:51.520" style="s2">if you come from a poor family and</p>

<p begin="00:41:57.760" end="00:42:02.160" style="s2">servants they don&#39;t go into industry</p>

<p begin="00:42:06.560" end="00:42:09.920" style="s2">there&#39;s some very interesting ideas here</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.480" end="00:42:11.520" style="s2">but you&#39;re not going to get it right up</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.920" end="00:42:12.960" style="s2">front so i&#39;ll give you a series of</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.520" end="00:42:15.680" style="s2">projects because i want to be around</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.960" end="00:42:17.520" style="s2">when it works</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.680" end="00:42:19.040" style="s2">and i can&#39;t think of any other civil</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.520" end="00:42:20.720" style="s2">servant in any other country in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.040" end="00:42:21.440" style="s2">world who would ever say that i&#39;ll take</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.720" end="00:42:25.119" style="s2">that risk</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.440" end="00:42:27.040" style="s2">but it was encouraged yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.119" end="00:42:28.800" style="s2">the the big thing that we&#39;ve been one of</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.040" end="00:42:30.079" style="s2">the latest latest things we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.800" end="00:42:33.760" style="s2">working on there is the</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.079" end="00:42:35.920" style="s2">built environment because</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.760" end="00:42:37.119" style="s2">singapore know two or three things first</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.920" end="00:42:39.520" style="s2">of all</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.119" end="00:42:41.200" style="s2">they&#39;re within two or three decades of</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.520" end="00:42:43.760" style="s2">having to have their whole hop</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.200" end="00:42:47.920" style="s2">having to have their whole population in</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.760" end="00:42:47.920" style="s2">air conditioning for several hours a day</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.000" end="00:42:52.160" style="s2">yeah yeah and malaysia is going to</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.319" end="00:42:54.079" style="s2">suffer mass casualties and major</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.160" end="00:42:55.280" style="s2">immigration because</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.079" end="00:42:57.920" style="s2">the temperature is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.280" end="00:42:59.520" style="s2">consistently above 55 degrees fahrenheit</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.920" end="00:43:01.040" style="s2">at which point the body can&#39;t shed heat</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.520" end="00:43:03.680" style="s2">fast enough</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.040" end="00:43:06.079" style="s2">yeah so they&#39;re preparing for that</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.680" end="00:43:07.599" style="s2">unlike most cities around the world</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.079" end="00:43:10.400" style="s2">and some of the stuff we&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.599" end="00:43:12.240" style="s2">there is actually increasing the size of</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.400" end="00:43:15.040" style="s2">the social space but reducing the</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.240" end="00:43:15.040" style="s2">personal space</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.079" end="00:43:19.760" style="s2">because if you look at the studies on</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.920" end="00:43:22.880" style="s2">aggressive behavior on rats</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.760" end="00:43:24.720" style="s2">close confinement in public spaces yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.880" end="00:43:26.880" style="s2">it can actually trigger the changes so</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.720" end="00:43:28.240" style="s2">we need to make the public spaces more</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.880" end="00:43:30.560" style="s2">than the private spaces</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.240" end="00:43:32.079" style="s2">yeah in that sort of sense so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.560" end="00:43:33.839" style="s2">been the path</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.079" end="00:43:36.000" style="s2">and they&#39;re thinking long term in that</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.839" end="00:43:37.920" style="s2">respect i think</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.000" end="00:43:39.359" style="s2">there are lots of other things on that i</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.920" end="00:43:41.040" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.359" end="00:43:43.119" style="s2">an example one of the things they did in</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.040" end="00:43:45.599" style="s2">the uk in the 70s</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.119" end="00:43:48.079" style="s2">we used to have to walk or used to have</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.599" end="00:43:50.480" style="s2">what were called two up two downs</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.079" end="00:43:51.760" style="s2">so two two rooms on the ground floor two</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.480" end="00:43:54.800" style="s2">rooms on the top floor</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.760" end="00:43:57.200" style="s2">in long terraced rows of houses yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.800" end="00:43:58.319" style="s2">with the toilet in a sort of shed in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.200" end="00:44:00.720" style="s2">back</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.319" end="00:44:02.000" style="s2">in colloquial english called the kazi</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.720" end="00:44:04.880" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.000" end="00:44:07.440" style="s2">um yeah and if you had to walk down the</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.880" end="00:44:09.280" style="s2">garden at 1963 when it was bloody</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.440" end="00:44:10.880" style="s2">freezing cold all right you you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.280" end="00:44:13.599" style="s2">knew about that</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.880" end="00:44:14.400" style="s2">um but those were real communities and</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.599" end="00:44:15.520" style="s2">then in</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.400" end="00:44:17.599" style="s2">the white house heat of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.520" end="00:44:18.480" style="s2">technological revolution to quote tony</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.599" end="00:44:20.240" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.480" end="00:44:21.760" style="s2">they basically demolished all of those</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.240" end="00:44:23.200" style="s2">and built tower blocks which were</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.760" end="00:44:24.880" style="s2">designed to be perfect living</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.200" end="00:44:26.240" style="s2">environments for each other</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.880" end="00:44:27.599" style="s2">and of course they destroyed the</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.240" end="00:44:29.200" style="s2">community they destroyed the</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.599" end="00:44:30.560" style="s2">dependencies they destroyed the</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.200" end="00:44:33.040" style="s2">interaction</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.560" end="00:44:34.400" style="s2">and those are now mostly slums with high</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.040" end="00:44:36.640" style="s2">levels of violence</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.400" end="00:44:38.800" style="s2">yeah and you don&#39;t go down the lifts on</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.640" end="00:44:42.560" style="s2">your own late at night</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.800" end="00:44:44.480" style="s2">yeah so i think one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.560" end="00:44:47.280" style="s2">and i i remember going to cumbernaut</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.480" end="00:44:50.160" style="s2">which is a brand new town in scotland</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.280" end="00:44:51.280" style="s2">which is now one of the major areas for</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.160" end="00:44:53.599" style="s2">crime</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.280" end="00:44:55.040" style="s2">but the architects had designed it for</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.599" end="00:44:58.480" style="s2">the way they thought people</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.040" end="00:45:00.240" style="s2">should live rather than building things</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.480" end="00:45:02.800" style="s2">on the way that people did live</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.240" end="00:45:03.520" style="s2">right so i think there&#39;s a whole body of</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.800" end="00:45:05.760" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.520" end="00:45:06.640" style="s2">yeah around that we need to think about</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.760" end="00:45:09.680" style="s2">right i mean</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.640" end="00:45:09.680" style="s2">those would be some example</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.839" end="00:45:14.000" style="s2">yeah thank you yeah well yeah i did an</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.560" end="00:45:16.880" style="s2">exchange in singapore</p>

<p begin="00:45:16.880" end="00:45:21.599" style="s2">interesting to me</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.000" end="00:45:21.599" style="s2">meet some of those people there um</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.000" end="00:45:26.560" style="s2">singapore is still a democracy whereas</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.760" end="00:45:28.880" style="s2">the u.s hasn&#39;t been for a few years</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.560" end="00:45:30.800" style="s2">well some would argue that it&#39;s a you</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.880" end="00:45:32.720" style="s2">know it&#39;s a pseudo democracy but</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.800" end="00:45:34.160" style="s2">but i get your point actually they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.720" end="00:45:36.079" style="s2">really they&#39;re really trying to get</p>

<p begin="00:45:36.079" end="00:45:38.880" style="s2">they&#39;re really worried that the workers</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.359" end="00:45:41.200" style="s2">party don&#39;t have enough but</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.880" end="00:45:42.960" style="s2">yeah people are quite happy with the way</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.200" end="00:45:44.960" style="s2">singapore is run and you don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.960" end="00:45:47.440" style="s2">have be a billionaire to get elected to</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.960" end="00:45:49.440" style="s2">their parliament</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.440" end="00:45:52.480" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s called a rotten borough in</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.440" end="00:45:52.480" style="s2">in democratic terms</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.800" end="00:45:56.560" style="s2">okay so uh are you able to stay like 10</p>

<p begin="00:46:14.400" end="00:46:18.560" style="s2">question relative to</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.480" end="00:46:19.760" style="s2">kind of the conceit or the position of</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.560" end="00:46:22.079" style="s2">the stoa that is</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.760" end="00:46:24.000" style="s2">um you know know your work on</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.079" end="00:46:25.920" style="s2">multi-ontology sense making</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.000" end="00:46:27.359" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s an excellent framework that</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.920" end="00:46:29.680" style="s2">i think helps</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.359" end="00:46:31.520" style="s2">as a as a reference for sorting out</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.680" end="00:46:32.560" style="s2">ontological and epistemological</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.520" end="00:46:35.760" style="s2">positions</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.560" end="00:46:39.119" style="s2">and ways of of interacting and knowing</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.760" end="00:46:41.040" style="s2">um how they might cross in communication</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.119" end="00:46:42.800" style="s2">and so the in the store there&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.040" end="00:46:44.319" style="s2">kind of launched with this position of</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.800" end="00:46:47.760" style="s2">the time of meta crisis</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.319" end="00:46:50.800" style="s2">with hardened positions in this crisis</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.760" end="00:46:54.240" style="s2">arising in memetic tribes</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.800" end="00:46:57.440" style="s2">and so in these mimetic tribes are</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.240" end="00:47:00.400" style="s2">you know the different trope tribes that</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.440" end="00:47:01.760" style="s2">we&#39;re shunted into these can be seen as</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.400" end="00:47:04.960" style="s2">micro ontologies</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.760" end="00:47:07.280" style="s2">right they&#39;re ways that we&#39;re we</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.960" end="00:47:08.960" style="s2">identify ourselves and hold not just to</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.280" end="00:47:10.240" style="s2">the tribe but all the positions that go</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.960" end="00:47:12.560" style="s2">along with it</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.240" end="00:47:14.400" style="s2">and they could blend but we&#39;re kept in</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.560" end="00:47:16.640" style="s2">our swim lanes by this kind of new</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.400" end="00:47:19.599" style="s2">tribalism social media</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.640" end="00:47:21.680" style="s2">um propaganda reinforcers so we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.599" end="00:47:23.359" style="s2">this world of strong norms</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.680" end="00:47:25.520" style="s2">and people are butting up against each</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.359" end="00:47:27.760" style="s2">other&#39;s positions all the time</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.520" end="00:47:29.680" style="s2">my question would be then given</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.760" end="00:47:30.559" style="s2">maldiantology sense-making or how that</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.680" end="00:47:32.319" style="s2">might evolve</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.559" end="00:47:34.720" style="s2">how do we break out of these these</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.319" end="00:47:37.359" style="s2">strong normative lanes while holding</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.720" end="00:47:39.040" style="s2">our reputations not getting canceled how</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.359" end="00:47:43.119" style="s2">can we communicate</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.040" end="00:47:45.520" style="s2">um within these expectation loops</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.119" end="00:47:47.520" style="s2">to help to help ourselves and help</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.520" end="00:47:50.160" style="s2">others blend ontologies</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.520" end="00:47:51.280" style="s2">in a you know i mean it takes some risk</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.160" end="00:47:54.880" style="s2">right how do we</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.280" end="00:47:56.640" style="s2">how do we help um i don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.880" end="00:47:59.119" style="s2">change in a way of thinking about your</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.640" end="00:48:01.359" style="s2">framework or using that in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.119" end="00:48:04.720" style="s2">we might communicate better to loosen</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.359" end="00:48:06.240" style="s2">the hold of these tribal mental models</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.720" end="00:48:08.240" style="s2">i think there&#39;s some things we can bring</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.240" end="00:48:09.760" style="s2">in straight straight away one is</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.240" end="00:48:12.559" style="s2">we have a massive problem with the</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.760" end="00:48:15.280" style="s2">internet because the internet is an</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.559" end="00:48:17.280" style="s2">unbuffered feedback loop</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.280" end="00:48:18.720" style="s2">if you have an unbuffered feedback loop</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.280" end="00:48:20.319" style="s2">then perversion will come</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.720" end="00:48:22.559" style="s2">faster and it will be more or less</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.319" end="00:48:24.000" style="s2">unstoppable if you remember what</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.559" end="00:48:25.599" style="s2">happened with automatic trading</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.000" end="00:48:27.040" style="s2">algorithms which caused the stock</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.599" end="00:48:28.640" style="s2">exchange to crash it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.040" end="00:48:30.640" style="s2">principle</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.640" end="00:48:32.319" style="s2">so one of the programs which we&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.640" end="00:48:34.000" style="s2">trying to get funding for but we&#39;ve now</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.319" end="00:48:37.920" style="s2">done in sweden colombia</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.000" end="00:48:40.079" style="s2">singapore egypt and elsewhere</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.920" end="00:48:41.520" style="s2">is to use children as ethnographers</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.079" end="00:48:44.720" style="s2">through their schools into their</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.520" end="00:48:47.839" style="s2">communities on a continuous basis</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.720" end="00:48:49.839" style="s2">so we put human interpretation and human</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.839" end="00:48:51.920" style="s2">validation of data</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.839" end="00:48:53.440" style="s2">rather than the classic black box this</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.920" end="00:48:55.920" style="s2">is kind of like called rich data as</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.440" end="00:48:58.960" style="s2">opposed to thick data or big data</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.920" end="00:49:00.640" style="s2">yeah so we increase the human buffering</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.960" end="00:49:02.640" style="s2">in the system</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.640" end="00:49:04.319" style="s2">which also increases the empathy the</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.640" end="00:49:04.720" style="s2">other thing we&#39;ve also been doing there</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.319" end="00:49:06.319" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.720" end="00:49:09.040" style="s2">i&#39;m quite proud of is what we call</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.319" end="00:49:11.200" style="s2">transgenerational pairing</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.040" end="00:49:13.200" style="s2">so that&#39;s linking young people with</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.200" end="00:49:16.240" style="s2">people in their grandparents generation</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.200" end="00:49:17.680" style="s2">to come up with local initiatives so</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.240" end="00:49:19.839" style="s2">trying to get away from grand</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.680" end="00:49:21.119" style="s2">initiatives to local initiatives locally</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.839" end="00:49:23.359" style="s2">generated</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.119" end="00:49:26.480" style="s2">now again that was science-based because</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.359" end="00:49:27.839" style="s2">we know that brain plasticity</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.480" end="00:49:29.920" style="s2">yeah kinda like unless you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.839" end="00:49:32.000" style="s2">traumatized it kind of like stops in</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.920" end="00:49:34.960" style="s2">your early 20s and doesn&#39;t start again</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.000" end="00:49:34.960" style="s2">until your 50s</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.280" end="00:49:39.599" style="s2">so if you want innovation you need to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.599" end="00:49:43.040" style="s2">under 25 or over 50.</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.599" end="00:49:44.480" style="s2">you don&#39;t get much between the two and</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.040" end="00:49:45.760" style="s2">they kind of like really i know every</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.480" end="00:49:46.960" style="s2">everybody&#39;s going to like this one of</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.760" end="00:49:48.400" style="s2">these days right</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.960" end="00:49:50.720" style="s2">but it&#39;s actually quite interesting</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.400" end="00:49:52.240" style="s2">innovation in the sciences is under 25</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.720" end="00:49:53.760" style="s2">in the humanities it&#39;s generally when</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.240" end="00:49:57.040" style="s2">you&#39;re older</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.760" end="00:49:58.160" style="s2">because and the evolutionary argument is</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.040" end="00:50:00.000" style="s2">because it&#39;s synthesis</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.160" end="00:50:01.839" style="s2">not flashes of genius it&#39;s the ability</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.000" end="00:50:04.079" style="s2">to bring things together</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.839" end="00:50:05.119" style="s2">which is what the humanities is about</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.079" end="00:50:07.920" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.119" end="00:50:10.000" style="s2">so if you look in evolutionary terms we</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.920" end="00:50:11.680" style="s2">have the longest period of training of</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.000" end="00:50:13.760" style="s2">any mammal</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.680" end="00:50:15.280" style="s2">so there&#39;s very high levels of</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.760" end="00:50:18.319" style="s2">plasticity up until</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.280" end="00:50:19.599" style="s2">two in fact as far as we can see some of</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.319" end="00:50:21.760" style="s2">your neocortex</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.599" end="00:50:22.800" style="s2">processing is actually done by your</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.760" end="00:50:26.240" style="s2">carers</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.800" end="00:50:28.319" style="s2">until too yeah we don&#39;t quite know the</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.240" end="00:50:30.000" style="s2">mechanism for it yet but it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.319" end="00:50:32.640" style="s2">why if you don&#39;t get the right level of</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.000" end="00:50:34.640" style="s2">nurture in those first two years</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.640" end="00:50:36.720" style="s2">there are capacities which you never get</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.640" end="00:50:40.079" style="s2">a chance to develop again</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.720" end="00:50:41.920" style="s2">it&#39;s an absolutely critical period um as</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.079" end="00:50:43.280" style="s2">you start to hit puberty the brain</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.920" end="00:50:46.319" style="s2">starts to lock down because you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.280" end="00:50:48.559" style="s2">to go and hunt for the tribe</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.319" end="00:50:49.680" style="s2">yeah and whatever the prejudices of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.559" end="00:50:52.160" style="s2">tribe you&#39;ll adopt</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.680" end="00:50:55.119" style="s2">you actually don&#39;t see racism in kids</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.160" end="00:50:57.119" style="s2">and before puberty</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.119" end="00:50:58.800" style="s2">yeah but it comes in big time after</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.119" end="00:51:00.720" style="s2">puberty</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.800" end="00:51:02.079" style="s2">right and then interestingly chemically</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.720" end="00:51:04.480" style="s2">triggered male or female</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.079" end="00:51:05.280" style="s2">you know mid 40s 50s it becomes plastic</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.480" end="00:51:07.119" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.280" end="00:51:09.119" style="s2">and the argument is if you survive to</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.119" end="00:51:10.559" style="s2">that age and have to gather a tribe</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.119" end="00:51:12.880" style="s2">you&#39;ve got something about you which the</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.559" end="00:51:14.400" style="s2">tribe needs but you better bloody will</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.880" end="00:51:16.160" style="s2">stop leading it because you&#39;re not fit</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.400" end="00:51:17.599" style="s2">enough anymore so you go and sit around</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.160" end="00:51:18.240" style="s2">the campfire and look after the kids and</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.599" end="00:51:21.520" style="s2">teach them</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.240" end="00:51:24.720" style="s2">yeah so we&#39;ve replicated that you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.520" end="00:51:26.400" style="s2">15 transgenerational pairs</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.720" end="00:51:28.160" style="s2">if they come up with a good idea they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.400" end="00:51:31.680" style="s2">put into a trio with somebody from</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.160" end="00:51:31.680" style="s2">government who makes their ideas work</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.839" end="00:51:36.559" style="s2">so we&#39;re using technology as a connector</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.480" end="00:51:37.760" style="s2">but we&#39;re increasing human buffering in</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.559" end="00:51:39.920" style="s2">the system</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.760" end="00:51:42.079" style="s2">right so that&#39;s key the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.920" end="00:51:44.480" style="s2">which i&#39;ll probably talk about next week</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.079" end="00:51:46.880" style="s2">is we&#39;ve brought heavily on board in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.480" end="00:51:51.839" style="s2">latest release of canavin</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.880" end="00:51:51.839" style="s2">um the concept of apparea</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.240" end="00:51:57.520" style="s2">all right and the apparatic okay</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.359" end="00:51:58.640" style="s2">now remember the basic concept of our</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.520" end="00:52:01.680" style="s2">career yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.640" end="00:52:03.520" style="s2">is that it&#39;s the end result that oh the</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.680" end="00:52:05.040" style="s2">only decision which is ever made is</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.520" end="00:52:08.240" style="s2">where you don&#39;t know what decision you</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.040" end="00:52:10.880" style="s2">can make everything else is a process</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.240" end="00:52:13.280" style="s2">so the deliberate shift into an</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.880" end="00:52:16.160" style="s2">apparatic state</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.280" end="00:52:18.480" style="s2">yeah a conscious apparatic state and</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.160" end="00:52:19.839" style="s2">then the ontological shift from that</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.480" end="00:52:22.160" style="s2">and that&#39;s actually all written up in</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.839" end="00:52:25.119" style="s2">the eu handbook on crisis management</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.160" end="00:52:27.280" style="s2">i&#39;ll go through that here is you</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.119" end="00:52:29.760" style="s2">basically in a crisis what you do is you</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.280" end="00:52:32.160" style="s2">do radical sudden draconian imposition</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.760" end="00:52:33.920" style="s2">of constraints</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.160" end="00:52:35.440" style="s2">yeah the new zealand prime minister did</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.920" end="00:52:36.800" style="s2">this brilliantly she could have got it</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.440" end="00:52:39.680" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.800" end="00:52:41.440" style="s2">but and that&#39;s okay but it was better to</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.680" end="00:52:44.480" style="s2">do it then because she couldn&#39;t wait the</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.440" end="00:52:46.079" style="s2">british and the americans waited</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.480" end="00:52:48.559" style="s2">when they imposed it it was kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.079" end="00:52:49.680" style="s2">too late to make a massive difference so</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.559" end="00:52:52.079" style="s2">you know you&#39;re going to get a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.680" end="00:52:54.480" style="s2">this wrong but you you basically make</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.079" end="00:52:56.480" style="s2">decisions fast to increase your options</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.480" end="00:52:59.200" style="s2">space downstream</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.480" end="00:53:01.040" style="s2">yeah and that gives you the time to go</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.200" end="00:53:01.599" style="s2">into the apparatic state and then you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.040" end="00:53:04.160" style="s2">got</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.599" end="00:53:06.240" style="s2">you know four different movements one is</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.160" end="00:53:07.760" style="s2">those experts you were ignoring who you</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.240" end="00:53:10.720" style="s2">now would know were right we&#39;ll call</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.760" end="00:53:12.559" style="s2">them in apologize give them some cash</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.720" end="00:53:14.079" style="s2">if you&#39;ve got competition between</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.559" end="00:53:15.640" style="s2">experts like in</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.079" end="00:53:18.319" style="s2">behavioral scientists against</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.640" end="00:53:20.400" style="s2">epidemiologists which was a big issue</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.319" end="00:53:22.480" style="s2">in the uk then you ritualize the</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.400" end="00:53:25.200" style="s2">confrontation</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.480" end="00:53:27.200" style="s2">yeah to resolve it if you know the</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.200" end="00:53:27.599" style="s2">hypothesis about what you should do you</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.200" end="00:53:29.520" style="s2">run</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.599" end="00:53:31.119" style="s2">parallel safe to fair experiments about</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.520" end="00:53:32.559" style="s2">the hypotheses</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.119" end="00:53:34.640" style="s2">if you don&#39;t think you&#39;ve covered off</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.559" end="00:53:36.400" style="s2">the hypotheses then you do a mass</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.640" end="00:53:37.520" style="s2">sensing thing over a multi-sensor</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.400" end="00:53:39.440" style="s2">network</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.520" end="00:53:41.599" style="s2">from multiple perspectives in order to</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.440" end="00:53:42.960" style="s2">identify the hypotheses</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.599" end="00:53:45.680" style="s2">now if you look what i&#39;ve done there</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.960" end="00:53:47.599" style="s2">i&#39;ve got a simple stage plan</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.680" end="00:53:48.800" style="s2">which is all about awareness all right</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.599" end="00:53:51.200" style="s2">what you&#39;re trying to do is to shift</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.800" end="00:53:52.640" style="s2">decision makers to be aware</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.200" end="00:53:54.640" style="s2">that there are systems where they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.640" end="00:53:56.000" style="s2">have the right answer</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.640" end="00:53:57.359" style="s2">not only can&#39;t they have the right</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.000" end="00:53:58.800" style="s2">answer but if they do think they&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.359" end="00:54:01.920" style="s2">the right answer they&#39;re 90</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.800" end="00:54:03.599" style="s2">certain to be wrong and and this is why</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.920" end="00:54:05.839" style="s2">a lot of us are pretty pissed off with</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.599" end="00:54:07.680" style="s2">talent because talent blocks anybody who</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.839" end="00:54:09.839" style="s2">doesn&#39;t worship at his feet</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.680" end="00:54:11.520" style="s2">and i&#39;m proud to have been blocked by</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.839" end="00:54:13.520" style="s2">talib all right i mean this is i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.520" end="00:54:15.359" style="s2">trying to get blocked by trump as well</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.520" end="00:54:17.359" style="s2">and i&#39;ve got the complete card set of</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.359" end="00:54:19.599" style="s2">arrogant bastards right</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.359" end="00:54:20.880" style="s2">um and you know you&#39;ve got people like</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.599" end="00:54:23.760" style="s2">didier&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.880" end="00:54:27.599" style="s2">in um in zurich which is much better but</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.760" end="00:54:27.599" style="s2">the concept of the fat tail is key</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.760" end="00:54:31.200" style="s2">because fundamentally in the center of a</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.520" end="00:54:33.920" style="s2">normal distribution you can use</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.200" end="00:54:36.160" style="s2">inductive logic</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.920" end="00:54:37.920" style="s2">which means you can create predictions</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.160" end="00:54:38.720" style="s2">but in the tails of a pareto</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.920" end="00:54:41.040" style="s2">distribution</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.720" end="00:54:43.280" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to up take an abductive not</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.040" end="00:54:45.920" style="s2">an inductive approach</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.280" end="00:54:47.359" style="s2">okay now abduction is yes goes back to</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.920" end="00:54:50.400" style="s2">quine right this is the</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.359" end="00:54:52.319" style="s2">the logic of hunches now the challenge i</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.400" end="00:54:53.920" style="s2">was given by poindexter when i went to</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.319" end="00:54:56.160" style="s2">work for him in darpa and just to be</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.920" end="00:54:58.559" style="s2">clear i&#39;m a wealth socialist</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.160" end="00:55:00.160" style="s2">um i didn&#39;t know who he was until i</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.559" end="00:55:01.760" style="s2">decided i liked him and then i</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.160" end="00:55:03.680" style="s2">discovered i wasn&#39;t meant to like him</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.760" end="00:55:04.799" style="s2">but i&#39;m afraid i&#39;ve got a lot of respect</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.680" end="00:55:07.040" style="s2">for john</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.799" end="00:55:07.040" style="s2">john</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.280" end="00:55:16.799" style="s2">yeah well he had two programs he had tia</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.680" end="00:55:18.799" style="s2">which he got into trouble with the</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.799" end="00:55:20.240" style="s2">congress with he had genoa too which i</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.799" end="00:55:21.920" style="s2">ran with meredith</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.240" end="00:55:24.480" style="s2">which was the human side people forget</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.920" end="00:55:27.359" style="s2">about that one he had two bets</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.480" end="00:55:29.680" style="s2">yeah and i remember him saying when he</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.359" end="00:55:32.559" style="s2">was nsa</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.680" end="00:55:33.200" style="s2">um every time he asked for advice all</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.559" end="00:55:35.359" style="s2">the a</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.200" end="00:55:37.599" style="s2">all the agencies competed to have their</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.359" end="00:55:40.240" style="s2">advice accepted not to tell him what he</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.599" end="00:55:42.160" style="s2">needed to know</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.240" end="00:55:45.760" style="s2">and i&#39;ve validated that with two other</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.160" end="00:55:48.079" style="s2">nsa since one democrat one republican</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.760" end="00:55:50.319" style="s2">so he said your job is to find a way in</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.079" end="00:55:52.559" style="s2">which i can go directly from an abstract</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.319" end="00:55:54.559" style="s2">representation to the raw data without</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.559" end="00:55:58.559" style="s2">interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.559" end="00:56:01.760" style="s2">okay and that&#39;s called disintermediation</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.559" end="00:56:03.119" style="s2">now that&#39;s key to changing people yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.760" end="00:56:06.240" style="s2">the big thing we&#39;re working on at the</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.119" end="00:56:08.480" style="s2">moment is to entangle a politician</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.240" end="00:56:09.599" style="s2">with the lives of people who vote for</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.480" end="00:56:11.839" style="s2">them so they can see</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.599" end="00:56:13.119" style="s2">empathetic resonance that&#39;s our next big</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.839" end="00:56:16.240" style="s2">project</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.119" end="00:56:18.160" style="s2">yeah and without in without being</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.240" end="00:56:20.720" style="s2">buffered by interpretive layers</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.160" end="00:56:24.079" style="s2">so there&#39;s a lot of things we can do we</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.720" end="00:56:24.079" style="s2">just need to do them at scale</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.359" end="00:56:32.079" style="s2">thank you for that okay so we have a lot</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.480" end="00:56:35.359" style="s2">of plus ones on</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.079" end="00:56:35.359" style="s2">i&#39;ll just call anjan</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.839" end="00:56:39.520" style="s2">you have a question you&#39;d like to ask</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.200" end="00:56:42.559" style="s2">you could only just often ask or</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.520" end="00:56:43.359" style="s2">would you like me to um let me find my</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.559" end="00:56:45.839" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.359" end="00:56:45.839" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.280" end="00:56:50.799" style="s2">it would be useful by the way to have a</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.799" end="00:56:53.280" style="s2">copy of the chats because i can look at</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.799" end="00:56:55.599" style="s2">those before next week</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.280" end="00:56:57.680" style="s2">that sort of form in what i mean today</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.599" end="00:56:59.200" style="s2">was designed to be quite open and chat</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.680" end="00:57:00.559" style="s2">and then the next three a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.200" end="00:57:01.920" style="s2">structured so i&#39;m sort of working out</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.559" end="00:57:04.640" style="s2">what i put into those</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.920" end="00:57:05.359" style="s2">cool i&#39;ll get them for you i&#39;ve found my</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.640" end="00:57:07.280" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.359" end="00:57:08.880" style="s2">um what what are some systems or</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.280" end="00:57:09.359" style="s2">institutions that by conventional</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.880" end="00:57:12.000" style="s2">thinking</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.359" end="00:57:13.839" style="s2">are considered broken or failed but</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.000" end="00:57:14.319" style="s2">under a complexity framework you see</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.839" end="00:57:17.119" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.319" end="00:57:17.119" style="s2">they do things well</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.680" end="00:57:21.520" style="s2">um i&#39;m not sure i fully heard it but let</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.000" end="00:57:22.960" style="s2">me answer what i think i&#39;ve heard and</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.520" end="00:57:24.079" style="s2">then you can tell me how wrong it was</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.960" end="00:57:25.119" style="s2">all right</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.079" end="00:57:28.880" style="s2">i think there&#39;s some interesting</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.119" end="00:57:30.799" style="s2">examples here jury trial is broken</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.880" end="00:57:32.160" style="s2">um but there are actually better ways of</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.799" end="00:57:34.160" style="s2">doing that um</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.160" end="00:57:36.480" style="s2">one of the things we&#39;re we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.160" end="00:57:38.720" style="s2">work on an experiment with at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.480" end="00:57:40.880" style="s2">is to have four juries of three people</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.720" end="00:57:42.559" style="s2">in separate rooms</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.880" end="00:57:44.880" style="s2">and if three of the four agree the</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.559" end="00:57:47.200" style="s2">person is guilty or innocent</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.880" end="00:57:49.119" style="s2">yeah so you start you stop the phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.200" end="00:57:50.799" style="s2">of 12 people in a room being dominated</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.119" end="00:57:52.160" style="s2">by one personality</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.799" end="00:57:54.000" style="s2">so that&#39;s taking a complexity</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.160" end="00:57:55.359" style="s2">perspective right</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.000" end="00:57:56.799" style="s2">um i think the other thing which is</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.359" end="00:57:58.880" style="s2">completely shot at the moment is</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.799" end="00:58:02.000" style="s2">democracy</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.880" end="00:58:02.240" style="s2">um democracy in the form most of us know</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.000" end="00:58:06.160" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.240" end="00:58:07.280" style="s2">evolved in in england in the 19th</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.160" end="00:58:09.359" style="s2">century</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.280" end="00:58:11.520" style="s2">you know with the great reformats and it</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.359" end="00:58:13.119" style="s2">was based on a small population where</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.520" end="00:58:14.960" style="s2">people could know who they were voting</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.119" end="00:58:17.359" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.960" end="00:58:19.119" style="s2">yeah so there was and people regularly</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.359" end="00:58:20.720" style="s2">crossed the floor so people changed</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.119" end="00:58:25.839" style="s2">party allegiance there was</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.720" end="00:58:28.559" style="s2">a lot of flux yeah by the 1950s and 60s</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.839" end="00:58:30.480" style="s2">yeah the population was so big that</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.559" end="00:58:32.000" style="s2">people voted for a slate they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.480" end="00:58:34.480" style="s2">vote for a person</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.000" end="00:58:36.480" style="s2">because they couldn&#39;t know them and</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.480" end="00:58:38.240" style="s2">people always you know in order to be in</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.480" end="00:58:39.839" style="s2">parliament you had to be in a political</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.240" end="00:58:41.440" style="s2">party and you kind of like chose the one</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.839" end="00:58:42.559" style="s2">at university based on who was going to</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.440" end="00:58:44.400" style="s2">be there</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.559" end="00:58:45.839" style="s2">um so you&#39;ve got that sort of problem</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.400" end="00:58:47.280" style="s2">yeah and i go back to the american</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.839" end="00:58:49.119" style="s2">constitution</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.280" end="00:58:51.200" style="s2">if you go back to the founding fathers</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.119" end="00:58:54.160" style="s2">they said nobody should be elected to</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.200" end="00:58:58.000" style="s2">the poster president by the popular vote</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.160" end="00:59:00.160" style="s2">because we&#39;ll get despots and populists</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.000" end="00:59:02.000" style="s2">yeah and the holy actual college which</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.160" end="00:59:03.440" style="s2">you find some people you trust and they</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.000" end="00:59:04.000" style="s2">go away and pick somebody to be</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.440" end="00:59:06.000" style="s2">president</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.000" end="00:59:07.680" style="s2">because we give them a lot of powers</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.000" end="00:59:09.920" style="s2">yeah so i think</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.680" end="00:59:11.359" style="s2">there&#39;s some and there are issues there</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.920" end="00:59:12.720" style="s2">on the you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.359" end="00:59:15.599" style="s2">the number of acquaintances you can</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.720" end="00:59:17.920" style="s2">maintain is about 150.</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.599" end="00:59:20.319" style="s2">um once a population goes above about</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.920" end="00:59:23.200" style="s2">five million it loses cultural cohesion</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.319" end="00:59:24.960" style="s2">and it gets fractious</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.200" end="00:59:26.880" style="s2">so there&#39;s a whole body of stuff we know</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.960" end="00:59:29.040" style="s2">there in terms of looking at for example</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.880" end="00:59:30.839" style="s2">delegative democracy rather than one</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.040" end="00:59:33.520" style="s2">person one vote</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.839" end="00:59:35.520" style="s2">yeah um and the perversion is high i</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.520" end="00:59:37.200" style="s2">mean i think america is the only country</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.520" end="00:59:38.559" style="s2">in the world where you can advertise</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.200" end="00:59:40.319" style="s2">your services to stop</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.559" end="00:59:44.000" style="s2">people voting and you don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.319" end="00:59:44.000" style="s2">imprisoned to put in prison for it</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.400" end="00:59:48.880" style="s2">yeah so you know the the the democracy</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.599" end="00:59:51.920" style="s2">is shot at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.880" end="00:59:53.680" style="s2">right and you know we&#39;re working with</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.920" end="00:59:55.440" style="s2">extinction rebellion which is really</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.680" end="00:59:56.880" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.440" end="00:59:59.040" style="s2">um because they&#39;re going through the</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.880" end="01:00:00.000" style="s2">same sort of factional fights that left</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.040" end="01:00:03.200" style="s2">went through in the</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.000" end="01:00:06.400" style="s2">70s yeah yeah the monty python</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.200" end="01:00:07.680" style="s2">life of brian people&#39;s front of judea is</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.400" end="01:00:09.760" style="s2">regrettably still</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.680" end="01:00:11.359" style="s2">present in the ecological movement right</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.760" end="01:00:13.359" style="s2">so we&#39;re trying to change that</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.359" end="01:00:15.599" style="s2">right but one things we&#39;re doing with</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.359" end="01:00:17.440" style="s2">them and some others is we&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.599" end="01:00:19.680" style="s2">how can we involve the whole of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.440" end="01:00:21.680" style="s2">population in the citizen jury and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.680" end="01:00:24.720" style="s2">already done that in wales</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.680" end="01:00:26.640" style="s2">or in the citizen assembly</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.720" end="01:00:28.559" style="s2">um but the trouble is at the moment</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.640" end="01:00:30.720" style="s2">everybody&#39;s jumping into new ways of</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.559" end="01:00:32.000" style="s2">making decisions without having the raw</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.720" end="01:00:33.839" style="s2">science they&#39;re just doing what they</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.000" end="01:00:34.960" style="s2">think works or copying what somebody</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.839" end="01:00:36.319" style="s2">else did</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.960" end="01:00:38.799" style="s2">and that ain&#39;t gonna work because it</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.319" end="01:00:40.640" style="s2">won&#39;t scale i mean one of the classic</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.799" end="01:00:43.680" style="s2">mistakes people make in the middle east</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.640" end="01:00:45.520" style="s2">is we confuse we confuse gifts with</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.680" end="01:00:47.200" style="s2">bribes</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.520" end="01:00:49.359" style="s2">the middle east is based around a</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.200" end="01:00:51.520" style="s2">gifting culture but from a western</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.359" end="01:00:53.040" style="s2">perspective it looks like a bribe</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.520" end="01:00:54.960" style="s2">and so we end up making the thing</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.040" end="01:00:56.480" style="s2">corrupt because we don&#39;t understand the</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.960" end="01:00:58.240" style="s2">way it works</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.480" end="01:00:59.680" style="s2">in the west we have an equivalent if you</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.240" end="01:01:02.160" style="s2">belong to the right golf club you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.680" end="01:01:03.760" style="s2">going to get contracts</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.160" end="01:01:05.839" style="s2">yeah the way darpa money is adequate</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.760" end="01:01:07.119" style="s2">happy i&#39;ve got i&#39;ve had darpa contracts</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.839" end="01:01:09.599" style="s2">it&#39;s very simple</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.119" end="01:01:11.440" style="s2">you get invited to a hotel for two days</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.599" end="01:01:12.799" style="s2">you pay for your own time you talk about</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.440" end="01:01:14.720" style="s2">the solution</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.799" end="01:01:17.200" style="s2">if they like what you say they write the</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.720" end="01:01:18.160" style="s2">rfp to exactly match what you said so</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.200" end="01:01:21.280" style="s2">you get the contract</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.160" end="01:01:23.200" style="s2">that&#39;s how darpa works</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.280" end="01:01:25.119" style="s2">because you need the human judgment</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.200" end="01:01:28.240" style="s2">element within the system</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.119" end="01:01:30.000" style="s2">so this question about a new this is why</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.240" end="01:01:31.920" style="s2">might have sounds making is called</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.000" end="01:01:34.640" style="s2">naturalizing sense making</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.920" end="01:01:36.559" style="s2">it&#39;s like naturalizing epistemology it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.640" end="01:01:40.079" style="s2">the base sense making in the natural</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.559" end="01:01:40.079" style="s2">sciences not the social sciences</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.640" end="01:01:50.000" style="s2">okay um so yeah we&#39;re just going to</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.760" end="01:01:51.520" style="s2">do one more question i&#39;m sorry everyone</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.000" end="01:01:54.720" style="s2">else</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.520" end="01:01:56.559" style="s2">but i&#39;m gonna call on rain uh</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.720" end="01:01:58.799" style="s2">yeah rin would you like to ask your</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.559" end="01:01:58.799" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.559" end="01:02:06.400" style="s2">yeah um thanks dave this is really</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.200" end="01:02:08.640" style="s2">amazing</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.400" end="01:02:10.160" style="s2">um i had a question i&#39;ll try to make it</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.640" end="01:02:12.000" style="s2">relevant for everybody</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.160" end="01:02:13.200" style="s2">it&#39;s really about distributed cognition</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.000" end="01:02:13.920" style="s2">but some of the things you were</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.200" end="01:02:16.240" style="s2">mentioning</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.920" end="01:02:17.839" style="s2">remind me of edwin hutchins work and i</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.240" end="01:02:21.280" style="s2">honestly haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.839" end="01:02:22.960" style="s2">uh read any um</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.280" end="01:02:24.799" style="s2">cognitive ethnography since reading</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.960" end="01:02:26.880" style="s2">hutchins so i&#39;m just curious</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.799" end="01:02:28.319" style="s2">uh how that influences your work and</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.880" end="01:02:30.079" style="s2">where&#39;s the overlap with</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.319" end="01:02:32.240" style="s2">either cognitive ethnography or</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.079" end="01:02:33.839" style="s2">distributed cognition</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.240" end="01:02:35.520" style="s2">cognition in the world is in that</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.839" end="01:02:37.200" style="s2">bookshelf behind me those are the books</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.520" end="01:02:40.000" style="s2">i keep going back to and reading</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.200" end="01:02:41.920" style="s2">all right um yeah i mean i think the the</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.000" end="01:02:44.559" style="s2">way we do it with human systems</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.920" end="01:02:49.359" style="s2">is that and there are several things</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.559" end="01:02:51.440" style="s2">human beings are brilliant at gaming</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.359" end="01:02:52.720" style="s2">so the thing a human being will do if</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.440" end="01:02:55.920" style="s2">you ask them a question</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.720" end="01:02:57.599" style="s2">is they&#39;ll work out what answer you want</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.920" end="01:02:58.960" style="s2">and they&#39;ll either give you that answer</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.599" end="01:03:00.720" style="s2">or they&#39;ll give you the opposite that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.960" end="01:03:03.119" style="s2">kind of like the basic response</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.720" end="01:03:03.839" style="s2">yeah so one of the things we developed</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.119" end="01:03:05.200" style="s2">and this was</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.839" end="01:03:07.920" style="s2">when that we were dealing with the</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.200" end="01:03:10.960" style="s2">problem from that john sent me which is</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.920" end="01:03:13.680" style="s2">how do you objectify abduction</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.960" end="01:03:14.960" style="s2">so how is one person&#39;s intuitively more</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.680" end="01:03:16.400" style="s2">accurate than somebody else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.960" end="01:03:19.520" style="s2">intuitively</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.400" end="01:03:21.119" style="s2">yeah and the way we did that was to</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.520" end="01:03:22.640" style="s2">create what&#39;s called high abstraction</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.119" end="01:03:24.880" style="s2">signification</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.640" end="01:03:25.760" style="s2">which is you interpret data but you</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.880" end="01:03:28.799" style="s2">can&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.760" end="01:03:31.039" style="s2">what the right answer is and the method</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.799" end="01:03:32.319" style="s2">of interpretation creates a cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.039" end="01:03:34.960" style="s2">load</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.319" end="01:03:36.960" style="s2">so you flip from what&#39;s called autonomic</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.960" end="01:03:40.160" style="s2">processing to what&#39;s called novelty</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.960" end="01:03:42.000" style="s2">receptive processing in real science</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.160" end="01:03:43.760" style="s2">or if you read economists who didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.000" end="01:03:45.440" style="s2">bother to walk across to the corridor</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.760" end="01:03:46.319" style="s2">and ask their neuroscience colleagues</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.440" end="01:03:49.440" style="s2">earlier</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.319" end="01:03:51.200" style="s2">thinking fast and thinking slow</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.440" end="01:03:54.000" style="s2">we knew everything that he found in that</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.200" end="01:03:55.359" style="s2">book before he found it</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.000" end="01:03:57.920" style="s2">but people just don&#39;t work across</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.359" end="01:03:58.480" style="s2">disciplines because that way you go</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.920" end="01:04:00.079" style="s2">deeper</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.480" end="01:04:01.839" style="s2">all right so that&#39;s the cognitive load</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.079" end="01:04:05.839" style="s2">aspect so if i get</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.839" end="01:04:08.400" style="s2">5000 people to interpret the same data</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.839" end="01:04:10.880" style="s2">in the same time slot in a way in which</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.400" end="01:04:13.359" style="s2">they don&#39;t know what the right answer is</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.880" end="01:04:15.760" style="s2">i can draw fitness landscapes from that</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.359" end="01:04:18.720" style="s2">which so the general pattern of belief</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.760" end="01:04:20.160" style="s2">and show the outlier beliefs and others</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.720" end="01:04:21.599" style="s2">and interesting we</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.160" end="01:04:24.839" style="s2">we originally developed this in the</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.599" end="01:04:27.280" style="s2">concept of conflict resolution in</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.839" end="01:04:28.559" style="s2">colombia and i&#39;m now using exactly the</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.280" end="01:04:31.680" style="s2">same techniques on</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.559" end="01:04:33.599" style="s2">conflict resolution in maternity</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.680" end="01:04:35.680" style="s2">services in scotland</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.599" end="01:04:37.280" style="s2">which to be quite honest is a lot ham a</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.680" end="01:04:38.480" style="s2">lot harder and more dangerous than</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.280" end="01:04:41.839" style="s2">handling the farc</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.480" end="01:04:44.480" style="s2">right um but you got this tension</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.839" end="01:04:46.319" style="s2">between surgeons who want all women at</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.480" end="01:04:48.880" style="s2">six months put into a hospital so</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.319" end="01:04:50.079" style="s2">there&#39;s no risk of anything going wrong</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.880" end="01:04:52.720" style="s2">but they&#39;ve got all their super</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.079" end="01:04:54.000" style="s2">equipment yeah and women in their</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.720" end="01:04:55.520" style="s2">families who quite like quite</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.000" end="01:04:57.680" style="s2">like to be in a local hospital and</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.520" end="01:04:59.119" style="s2">remember this is islands of scotland</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.680" end="01:05:00.559" style="s2">where you&#39;re two days from a hospital</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.119" end="01:05:02.160" style="s2">and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.559" end="01:05:04.559" style="s2">the way we&#39;re handling that is all the</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.160" end="01:05:06.960" style="s2">groups are presenting their summary</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.559" end="01:05:08.559" style="s2">then every other group will interpret</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.960" end="01:05:09.440" style="s2">everybody else&#39;s summaries and then</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.559" end="01:05:12.400" style="s2">we&#39;ll produce</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.440" end="01:05:13.280" style="s2">overlaid contour maps which so where</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.400" end="01:05:15.119" style="s2">they&#39;re agreed</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.280" end="01:05:16.400" style="s2">where the disagreement is so extreme</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.119" end="01:05:18.000" style="s2">they can&#39;t talk about it</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.400" end="01:05:20.559" style="s2">and where there are outlier clusters of</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.000" end="01:05:23.920" style="s2">agreement by which we can make a change</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.559" end="01:05:26.799" style="s2">that&#39;s distributed cognition yeah</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.920" end="01:05:28.720" style="s2">um it&#39;s and and if you&#39;ve got it and</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.799" end="01:05:30.079" style="s2">i&#39;ve argued for a very long time and</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.720" end="01:05:31.520" style="s2">this is where i would depart slightly</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.079" end="01:05:34.400" style="s2">from hutchins</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.520" end="01:05:36.160" style="s2">is human beings aren&#39;t ants this is what</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.400" end="01:05:38.079" style="s2">i keep saying down at santa fe and they</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.160" end="01:05:39.760" style="s2">get all upset about this because</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.079" end="01:05:41.280" style="s2">human beings have to be ants for their</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.760" end="01:05:44.960" style="s2">models to work</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.280" end="01:05:47.039" style="s2">yeah um human beings have intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.960" end="01:05:48.960" style="s2">we have multiple identities we have</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.039" end="01:05:51.680" style="s2">intentionality</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.960" end="01:05:52.480" style="s2">um human decision making is a level of</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.680" end="01:05:54.079" style="s2">complexity</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.480" end="01:05:56.559" style="s2">well above anything that you see in the</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.079" end="01:05:58.319" style="s2">wild we&#39;re the only species to show</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.559" end="01:06:00.000" style="s2">empathy outside the kinship group for</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.319" end="01:06:03.440" style="s2">example and that&#39;s significant</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.000" end="01:06:04.000" style="s2">yeah um i think i mentioned this last</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.440" end="01:06:05.920" style="s2">time but</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.000" end="01:06:08.319" style="s2">terry&#39;s brilliant book on radical</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.920" end="01:06:10.960" style="s2">sacrifice is worth reading</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.319" end="01:06:13.760" style="s2">uh human beings understand the necessity</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.960" end="01:06:16.000" style="s2">and role of sacrifice</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.760" end="01:06:17.200" style="s2">and that that&#39;s that we can build on so</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.000" end="01:06:19.119" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to build</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.200" end="01:06:23.280" style="s2">distributed cognition systems which</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.119" end="01:06:23.280" style="s2">recognize those unique aspects of humans</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.079" end="01:06:27.920" style="s2">excellent excellent um thank you thank</p>
