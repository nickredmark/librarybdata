<p begin="00:00:56.969" end="00:01:02.940" style="s2">with Jack Murphy which was 2,000 years</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.359" end="00:01:05.189" style="s2">we had a story where we were invited to</p>

<p begin="00:01:05.189" end="00:01:09.240" style="s2">hundred years we&#39;ve had a story where we</p>

<p begin="00:01:09.240" end="00:01:16.650" style="s2">got no choice and every day the how</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.590" end="00:01:21.600" style="s2">would I call it the pit gets wider and</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.650" end="00:01:24.570" style="s2">deeper and closer to our toes 1945 just</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.600" end="00:01:26.580" style="s2">where else make in 1962 just Khrushchev</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.570" end="00:01:28.979" style="s2">and Kennedy could have plunged the world</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.580" end="00:01:30.799" style="s2">into nuclear abyss just two guys and all</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.979" end="00:01:33.090" style="s2">they had to do is not push the button</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.799" end="00:01:34.790" style="s2">but every day and every way we just get</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.090" end="00:01:36.600" style="s2">better and better at killing everybody</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.790" end="00:01:38.909" style="s2">which means we got to get better and</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.600" end="00:01:41.820" style="s2">better at not killing everybody in that</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.909" end="00:01:44.520" style="s2">that that age-old thirteen point five</p>

<p begin="00:01:48.060" end="00:01:51.630" style="s2">we have to actually learn how to anchor</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.590" end="00:01:54.750" style="s2">ourselves in that space of peace to</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.630" end="00:01:56.310" style="s2">consistently and always as individuals</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.750" end="00:01:59.450" style="s2">and as a collective to make that choice</p>

<p begin="00:02:00.550" end="00:02:05.500" style="s2">and it&#39;s right there it says I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.650" end="00:02:07.150" style="s2">wewe sort of if we step back and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.500" end="00:02:09.430" style="s2">look at it we can tell that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.150" end="00:02:12.520" style="s2">currently right now living in two worlds</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.430" end="00:02:17.910" style="s2">simultaneously you can feel the energy</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.520" end="00:02:20.380" style="s2">of the of the Gerard Ian&#39;s conflict</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.910" end="00:02:22.440" style="s2">scarcity mentality that any moment wants</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.380" end="00:02:26.410" style="s2">to just tear apart the whole story</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.440" end="00:02:29.050" style="s2">pardon me on the other hand the other</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.410" end="00:02:30.730" style="s2">side salvation but that&#39;s the question</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.050" end="00:02:32.470" style="s2">that I was you know because the</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.730" end="00:02:35.350" style="s2">ambiguous part that I was alluding to is</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.470" end="00:02:38.290" style="s2">the idea that well yes scarcity tends to</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.350" end="00:02:40.540" style="s2">be the occasion for the impulse to find</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.290" end="00:02:43.120" style="s2">a scapegoat to resolve the tension if</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.540" end="00:02:45.850" style="s2">there&#39;s a famine if there&#39;s a plague if</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.120" end="00:02:48.670" style="s2">there&#39;s lack of resources if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.850" end="00:02:50.800" style="s2">murder spree whatever it is something</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.670" end="00:02:52.960" style="s2">creates scarcity scarcity of life</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.800" end="00:02:56.640" style="s2">scarcity of food scarcity of existence</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.960" end="00:02:59.200" style="s2">scarcity of order scarcity of resources</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.640" end="00:03:01.360" style="s2">scarcity of health and that triggers</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.200" end="00:03:03.310" style="s2">this hunt for the scapegoat so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.360" end="00:03:05.290" style="s2">still trying that today but my question</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.310" end="00:03:09.000" style="s2">is that some people would suggest and</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.290" end="00:03:10.920" style="s2">there&#39;s a quote I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.000" end="00:03:12.930" style="s2">I think it&#39;s does they have ski or</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.920" end="00:03:15.630" style="s2">someone that says basically that if we</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.930" end="00:03:17.970" style="s2">would resolve all scarcity issues if we</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.630" end="00:03:19.890" style="s2">can resolve all material want would</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.970" end="00:03:21.270" style="s2">human being stop their conflict and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.890" end="00:03:23.160" style="s2">like no there&#39;s something about here it</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.270" end="00:03:26.220" style="s2">means that you could meet all their</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.160" end="00:03:28.680" style="s2">needs and they would still find ways to</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.220" end="00:03:32.040" style="s2">create eternal drama so that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.680" end="00:03:33.270" style="s2">question is is it really in Iraq my mind</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.040" end="00:03:34.950" style="s2">about this all the time because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.270" end="00:03:37.380" style="s2">always on the hunt for things that could</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.950" end="00:03:39.840" style="s2">provide solutions for scarcity and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.380" end="00:03:41.820" style="s2">think about all right let&#39;s find energy</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.840" end="00:03:43.800" style="s2">too cheap to meter that&#39;s abundant you</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.820" end="00:03:45.959" style="s2">know what would that do to alleviate the</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.800" end="00:03:48.000" style="s2">social pressures to attack everybody</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.959" end="00:03:50.160" style="s2">based on collective identities and</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.000" end="00:03:52.020" style="s2">Nations and bombings and all these</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.160" end="00:03:54.060" style="s2">things with that with it would that</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.020" end="00:03:57.690" style="s2">reduce it a little bit and then what if</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.060" end="00:03:59.730" style="s2">we could have you know cures for cancer</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.690" end="00:04:01.380" style="s2">and Alzheimer&#39;s and diabetes and all</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.730" end="00:04:02.820" style="s2">these terrible things that are people</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.380" end="00:04:05.640" style="s2">are stressed out about they have this</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.820" end="00:04:07.200" style="s2">latent death anxiety and that bothers</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.640" end="00:04:09.450" style="s2">them knowing that people they love</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.200" end="00:04:10.530" style="s2">around them will have these afflictions</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.450" end="00:04:13.170" style="s2">that don&#39;t really seem to have any</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.530" end="00:04:14.910" style="s2">resolution or cure imagine we could just</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.170" end="00:04:17.100" style="s2">cure all those different things in our</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.910" end="00:04:21.090" style="s2">lifetime so we chew our pollution we</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.100" end="00:04:23.220" style="s2">cure energy scarcely reach or diseases</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.090" end="00:04:25.740" style="s2">that have been afflicting and scaring us</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.220" end="00:04:27.840" style="s2">would we still have the same level of</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.740" end="00:04:30.570" style="s2">conflict or would it reduce it that</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.840" end="00:04:32.130" style="s2">there is Jabba the Hutt all right that</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.570" end="00:04:34.050" style="s2">that&#39;s the thing we&#39;re the thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.130" end="00:04:36.720" style="s2">actually the problem which is the fear</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.050" end="00:04:38.520" style="s2">at your heart all right so to be the</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.720" end="00:04:40.350" style="s2">basis of your choice is fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.520" end="00:04:42.150" style="s2">anchored in fear and you try to solve</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.350" end="00:04:44.910" style="s2">that by endeavouring to extinguish</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.150" end="00:04:47.720" style="s2">scarcity in the outside and you you</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.910" end="00:04:47.720" style="s2">create</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.730" end="00:04:53.850" style="s2">neucopia of muchness and you you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.810" end="00:04:55.320" style="s2">actually not solved the problem even the</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.850" end="00:04:56.640" style="s2">least bit you haven&#39;t stepped it in</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.320" end="00:05:00.120" style="s2">practicum in ways you actually get more</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.640" end="00:05:02.760" style="s2">fearful in in the core and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.120" end="00:05:04.920" style="s2">another way alright the other way is to</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.760" end="00:05:05.430" style="s2">sort of recognize it the only zero to</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.920" end="00:05:07.230" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.430" end="00:05:09.960" style="s2">the only real bit that slips the only</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.230" end="00:05:14.040" style="s2">real change that could ever happen is at</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.960" end="00:05:16.200" style="s2">that basis of choice how much are you</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.040" end="00:05:17.940" style="s2">are you able to have the basis of choice</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.200" end="00:05:20.100" style="s2">the thing that is at the bottom of how</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.940" end="00:05:22.140" style="s2">it is you&#39;re coming into the choices or</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.100" end="00:05:23.940" style="s2">you&#39;re making how much are you able to</p>

<p begin="00:05:23.940" end="00:05:27.090" style="s2">space of love or peace or grace but if</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.220" end="00:05:29.070" style="s2">you&#39;re torn you&#39;d like to use and</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.090" end="00:05:31.200" style="s2">they&#39;re all all part of the same complex</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.070" end="00:05:36.390" style="s2">they can&#39;t really be named or fear or</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.200" end="00:05:38.070" style="s2">sin alright that&#39;s it because you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.390" end="00:05:39.180" style="s2">and we have plenty of stories that</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.070" end="00:05:41.460" style="s2">people who&#39;ve been able to make that</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.180" end="00:05:43.410" style="s2">shift if you can come from that place of</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.460" end="00:05:46.170" style="s2">love and you perceive a possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.410" end="00:05:48.030" style="s2">material scarcity real scarcity the way</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.170" end="00:05:48.870" style="s2">you relate to that real scarcity is just</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.030" end="00:05:50.910" style="s2">completely different</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.870" end="00:05:52.500" style="s2">contrariwise if you come from a place of</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.910" end="00:05:53.790" style="s2">fear and you&#39;re sitting in a world of</p>

<p begin="00:05:57.180" end="00:06:04.409" style="s2">drive a lot of your choice making so the</p>

<p begin="00:07:36.950" end="00:07:41.810" style="s2">is somewhere in the direction of how do</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.570" end="00:07:43.430" style="s2">i atone for my from the trespasses that</p>

<p begin="00:07:48.530" end="00:07:52.070" style="s2">how to juggle not easy but you can do it</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.140" end="00:07:53.240" style="s2">and once you&#39;ve done it</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.070" end="00:07:54.410" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re perfect it</p>

<p begin="00:07:57.410" end="00:08:00.470" style="s2">it does mean that you can do something</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.669" end="00:08:03.260" style="s2">there&#39;s a skillfulness and the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.470" end="00:08:06.290" style="s2">to orient yourself towards this basis of</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.260" end="00:08:08.210" style="s2">choice anchored in grace and love become</p>

<p begin="00:08:09.919" end="00:08:13.790" style="s2">and always knowing how to come back to</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.300" end="00:08:15.710" style="s2">it and then of course in that place</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.790" end="00:08:17.390" style="s2">everyone who has that skillfulness has a</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.710" end="00:08:19.100" style="s2">capacity to be in relationship with</p>

<p begin="00:08:20.900" end="00:08:25.250" style="s2">and that is the basis of true plenitude</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.150" end="00:08:27.350" style="s2">and this is I think this is the real</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.250" end="00:08:30.350" style="s2">conflict the real competition there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.350" end="00:08:32.690" style="s2">competition between the instincts that</p>

<p begin="00:08:36.560" end="00:08:41.479" style="s2">else be micro nema something called the</p>

<p begin="00:08:41.479" end="00:08:45.800" style="s2">rule is really good case study of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.190" end="00:08:51.380" style="s2">logic of scarcity and how important how</p>

<p begin="00:09:16.580" end="00:09:20.810" style="s2">and so people right underneath you who</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.110" end="00:09:23.840" style="s2">are your enforcers and perhaps your your</p>

<p begin="00:09:28.340" end="00:09:31.370" style="s2">than anything else but if you&#39;re good at</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.050" end="00:09:32.660" style="s2">what you do you can use the rules for</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.370" end="00:09:34.730" style="s2">rulers and keep things hanging together</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.660" end="00:09:36.800" style="s2">and maintain yourself and your cabal as</p>
